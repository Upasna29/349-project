The Swapper immediately brings to mind Super Metroid with it's open map design and emphasis on isolation. The human inhabitants of Theseus have mostly perished and it's up to you to put the pieces together. The space station is filed with sentient rocks that leave you with cryptic messages as you pass by them and, together with crew logs, provide much of the narrative; tantalizing you with little details that must be put together like a puzzle. It's a tale the wanders off in the direction of the metaphysical and philosophical, meditating on what constitutes a sense of self, what exactly the soul means to the individual and and how individuals fit into the rest of society. The esoteric narrative and heavy sense of  isolation and dread will have you mulling over the events of The Swapper long after it concludes.\n\nThe puzzle gimmick employed by The Swapper comes in the form of a gun that allows your character to clone themself. Up to four clones can be made and these clones mimic your every move. In addition the gun can beam your consciousness into these clones and  allow you to take direct control of them. Additional puzzle elements like blue lights that prohibit the creation of clones where their light is cast, red lights that prevent you from taking control of clones and gravity switches that will have you walking on the ceiling all further complicate the proceedings. Your clones must be used to trip switches and reach far away ledges, they are empty vessels that are to used and disposed of and the sight of their lifeless husks collapsing after long falls becomes a frequent occurrence throughout the course of The Swapper. The goal is to our the character that you directly control in contact with orbs that allow you to open doors and progress. These simple gameplay mechanics tie in closely to The Swapper's narrative themes meaning the narrative events never drift too far off into the back of your mind. Few games are able to do this so well.\n\nPuzzle start off very easy as you learn to navigate your environment and are introduced to clever new ways to solve problems within the game world. Much like Portal, The Swapper religiously sticks to it's core mechanics. You don't get any new abilities or skills as the game progresses, instead new obstacles bring new challenges that occasionally elicit head scratching and pensive stares. The first three quarters of the game's three to five hours are really a breeze but the final few puzzles can really put your puzzle solving skills to the test. While the challenge is certainly welcome, this spike in challenge has a habit of disrupting the pacing. Your brisk jaunts between memory stations for more information slow to a crawl near the final area potentially becoming agonizing as the game's mind benders thwart your best attempts to crack them.\n\nThe Swapper wouldn't be nearly as engaging if it weren't for it's distinct visual style. Everything in the game was originally molded out of clay by the team at Facepalm studios and in addition to complimenting the narrative themes it looks wonderfully alien and unique among it's contemporaries. Fantastic lighting effects also dress up the stylized art and drive the lonely desperate mood home. Seeing the dark, desolate corridors of Theseus illuminated by a beam from your flashlight as the ambient soundtrack hums in the background can be profoundly melancholy. The measured tempo of the soundtrack never leaves you with a sense of urgency and instead slowly and beautifully builds a hopeless and lonely tone befitting a game that is largely devoid of other characters.","November 25, 2013","true","6.3"," 180 of 204 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","180","204","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/231160/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","The Swapper is a puzzle platform game that was originally released on PC in 2013, and has since been ported to PS3, PS4, Vita, Wii U and the Xbox One. You play the role of a female explorer who finds themselves on an abandoned research station, early into the game you discover the ability to create clones of yourself. This ability is what the game focuses on from then onward.\n\nThe gameplay in Swapper is absolutely stellar, we see all too many puzzle platformers release on Steam on an almost daily basis that don't really do anything new and innovating, The Swapper blows this theroy out of the water though. The goal in this game is to find orbs scattered around the space station in order to open doors and activate teleporters to progress further. There is some aspect of metroidvania style games in that you do have to backtrack quite a bit too.\n\nThe cloning ability is what really makes this game standout, you can spawn four clones at any one time, and you also gain the ability to swap control over each of them too. The clones follow every action that the character makes, so running, jumping, interacting with objects (even if there is nothing there to interact with). This ability allows you to complete plentiful puzzles, opening doors, flipping switches and collecting orbs. The main element which will end up killing the player, as well as the clones, would be gravity. You will soon find that you can barely fall from any sort of distance as it will kill you. You can save yourself by creating a clone just before you hit the floor and teleporting to it though which is a trick you really need to get a hang of very early on.  You can also do this to scale walls and tunnels too.\n\nTo add a little bit more challenge into the mix, the game also introduces different light sources which prevent you from doing specific actions such as preventing clones from being spawned in the lighted area, blocking the swap ability, or just plainly stopping you doing anything all together.\n\nThe game presents you with a bare structure of a story line, and you are pretty much left to work it out on your own. There are plenty of snippets of story and plot to be found in the game through terminal computers if you want to delve deeper into it.\n\nThe Swapper is a gorgeous looking game, playing anything on a 4k resolution should look good, but this game just looks almost photo realistic.  The lighting is perfectly done, adding so much atmosphere into each room you enter. The animation of the main character is also done very well too.\n\nAs with all puzzle games, I wasn't able to figure out most of the puzzles and had to revert to a walkthrough; after reading the walkthrough there are still points in the game which are skill based, so no matter whether you know how to complete something, you still need to execute a certain level of skill to complete it.\n\nI was able to complete The Swapper in just under seven hours, if you were to do it without a guide, you are looking at about a ten hour playthrough. The game does have ten achievements, which are not related to the main story line at all. They are merely hidden computer terminals that you can try to find throughout the game. This may add a little bit of replay value, however if you aren't into achievement hunting, there isn't any reason to play this game through again for a second time.\n\nThe Swapper had no technical issues at all. The game ran perfectly well on all higher resolutions, at a constant 60FPS. The options menu is rather limited, but this game is in effect a 2D side scroller so you can't really expect too much from the technical side of things.\n\nIn conclusion, I have to say The Swapper is one of the best puzzle games on Steam to date; and should be played by everyone to experience this masterpiece. This is a showcase of how indie games should be produced and how quickly they can rise to being an extremely popular hit.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n3) Recommended\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

The game feels at times lonely, but not hostile; the player doesn't have to combat roaming creatures like in a Metroidvania game.  Mostly the game consists of exploring the Thesus V space station which is layed out in a clear and thoughful manner.\n\nPuzzles are the meat of the game which are solved by cloning yourself and swapping places with the clones.  All clones move in unison with you which forces careful placement and planning to solve each puzzle room.  The last batch of puzzles in the game are deviously clever and had me stumped for hours.  But if I can finish the game without help so can you.\n\nThere were a few things in the game I didn't care for such as  the sentient beings comment boxes overlaying the entire screen and obscuring the view; only momentary, but annoying.  Also, despite finding several hidden console rooms I unlocked no achievements, and this seems to be a problem for a few other players.\n\nI can safely recommend The Swapper to anyone that likes to solve puzzles or wants to explore a non-combative environment at a relaxing pace.","April 21, 2014","true","14.5"," 113 of 121 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","113","121","0","8"

The actual puzzle-solving aspect of the game is adequate, but with minimal diversity and accretion.  It is definitely a story-driven experience, with the gameplay taking a passenger seat.  If you can appreciate a game in that style, this is a good bet for you.\n\nThe entrancing narrative and the style in which it transpires work in concert with the mystifying ambiance to create a wondrous experience. The story touches on some thought-provoking metaphysical issues, while skillfully avoiding a fall too deep into the rabbit hole to keep the average person’s interest. Much of the rest of the narrative is comfortable, cliché sci-fi tropes that we all know and love.\n\nThe gameplay and the puzzles are far from bad, but they also are nothing special.  As I alluded to: they are sufficient, but fail to develop into anything overly interesting. Very little changes from the first puzzle to the last, so it does get a little bit dry.  That said, some of the later ones are quite tricky and a few require not only puzzle-solving ability but also decent reflexes.\n\nThe graphics are pleasurable and align perfectly with the vibe of the game. But the whole soundscape is what truly brings the atmosphere of The Swapper to life. The ambient soundtrack, the cryptic chatter, and the selectively placed voice-overs contribute a wonderful blend of emotions and mystery. If you are into it, this is a game you might enjoy with the lights off and your headphones on (or however else you may get into the zone).\n\nThe Swapper is a brief, interesting, and enjoyable experience. It is not a complex or intricate puzzle-platformer, but I recommend it to any fan of the genre who would appreciate the atmosphere and narrative.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","December 22, 2015","true","4.8"," 82 of 89 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","82","89","2","1"

I just can't think of this game as a platfomer. There are no death traps, no enemies to avoid, no coins or baubles to collect... it's simply an adventure game that happens to have some platforms in it.\n\nLet me get some of the technical stuff out of the way before I continue.\n\nThe game is configured to work with both PS and X-360 controllers, if you wish to use one.  You can adjust the sensitivity of both the controller and the mouse, if you're using the keyboard, through the Options menu.  There you can also adjust the screen resolution -- from 640x480 up to 1920x1080 -- the volume, Windowed or Full-screen, etc.  I highly recommend making sure the subtitles are ON whilst you're there -- There is an aspect of the story that I totally would have missed if I'd not had the subtitles on.  If you want to adjust the keyboard settings, it's on the bottom right of the Options screen.\n\nSo how does the gameplay work?  Well, I can't elaborate on that too much without giving things away, but I will give you what I can without adding spoilers. I do want to mention that there are hidden areas with extra story (via terminals,) which I knew nothing about until I finished the game.  Also, please note that you will get to the point that you realize you are going to have to have Godlike reflexes and tracking abilities to be able to progress in the game... Until you realize that there is a way to slow everything down to a crawl, which will allow you the time you need to get things done.  Incredibly helpful, not to mention necessary, since I don't think *anyone* can react that quickly!\n\nBack to the topic at hand, which is the gameplay.  You hold a "swapping" device in your hands that has two abilities: First is the duplicate function.  What this does is create exact replicas of you, and your replica(s) will mimic every move you make.  You can have up to four duplicates at any given time.  If they "die" you can create another to take its place, and when your duplicates touch you, they disappear, allowing you to make another.  Second is the "swapping" beam.  Zap any of your replicas with this beam to have your consciousness transferred to that body.  The swapping beam has one more function, and I mention it only because I got completely stuck, having NO idea you could do this:  If you are in freefall, you can use the beam to "push" yourself through space.\n\nThe game progresses through a series of puzzles based upon these abilities.  There are obstacles in that the swapping device reacts differently around colored lights.  For instance, you can create a duplicate within red light, but your swapping beam is completely blocked by the red.  The opposite holds true within blue light, and so on.\n\nThere is one puzzle that requires your bodies to be in exactly the right places (only one that is fiddly that way), one puzzle requires really good timing, and just one had me completely stumped to the point I had to come back to it the next day.  Solving the rest of the puzzles ranged from deceptively easy to, "YES!!  that felt SO good!!"\n\nYou might think by reading the above that this is just a puzzle game, but no -- this is a true adventure at heart, and so deeply environmental that it really feels as if you're problem-solving like you would any day in real life.  The devs have achieved this immersion through various ways, which I will describe below.\n\nThe music sets the tone so beautifully, so perfectly, that you don't really notice it at first.  Never distracting, I was more than once surprised to realize that not only was it was there, that it was lovely to listen to, as well.  "Lovely?" you ask, "In an atmospheric psychological horror?"  To that I say, "Absolutely!"  Just go with it, you'll see what I mean when you play.  The voices are done incredibly well, never feeling stilted or out-of-place.\n\nAnd that brings me to the story, that which binds the whole game together in this richly-woven tapestry.  The story progresses in multiple ways.  You will occasionally hear voices ( :O ... No, not that kind of "hearing voices"!) as you progress through the game, and, as mentioned, they are very well done.  Next up are the terminals, which give you snippets of conversations and orders from the command of this place you're in.  Lastly you have the thoughts of... something(s), which I will not give away.\n\nWhen I first saw the graphics, I thought they looked blurry... fuzzy, even.  It's amazing how differently you perceive things when you're actually playing the game yourself, and not just looking at screenshots or a video.  Suffice to say that the graphics contribute to the overall feeling of the game.  Somehow, The Swapper reminds me of John Carpenter's The Thing.  No, there's no parasitic life form trying to assimilate and/or mutilate you, but those feelings...  Cold.  Alone.  Uneasy.  It is all of these and more.\n\nThis is truly a must-play game for anyone who enjoys a deeply environmental game with a powerful tale to tell... a tale whose full implications I have yet to digest.  Better yet, this is a game that can be enjoyed even more upon subsequent play-throughs... And that is something I will be even more happy to do now that I know I missed some of the content my first time through.\n\nHighly recommended!","January 14, 2015","true","24.8"," 62 of 65 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","62","65","0","5"

Certain light wavelengths interfere with the device to add to puzzle complexity (for example, red light blocks transferring the mind of the player to a clone). The puzzles range from obvious to abstract, with the simplest puzzles at the start of the game. However, later puzzles vary massively in how difficult they are (depending on the player). Some puzzles may seem obvious to one individual, but will require a lot of trial & error for other players. There was one puzzle in particular that had me stumped for a long time, but upon completing it I realised it was actually quite simple and that many players would probably breeze past it quickly.\n\nTS starts with the player finding themself on a seemingly abandoned space station and very slowly introduces a plot which the player can entirely ignore if they see fit. The narrative is interwoven in the game through a few small scenes voiced by a mysterious other astronaut, some terminals with logs to read, and through messages conveyed to the player by rock samples scattered around the station. Quite like Dark Souls, it is up to the player to investigate the story and piece it together, and you are rewarding with a rather intriguing one if you bother.\n\nThe creepy atmosphere of this game is realised through some quite clever visual and audio tricks. The graphics alone are not very impressive, but the way lighting is used cleverly hides the imperfections and creates a very unique art-style which I adored. The soundtrack comes and goes but always leaves you feeling isolated and alone. Whenever the silence was punctured by speech of the other astronaut, I found I immediately stopped whatever I was doing to lap up all of the audio I could just to find a little solace in the company of someone other than the empty clones. It is the interplay between the art-style, the audio, and the clone mechanic that makes the atmosphere of this game so incredible.\n\nIf all this wasn't enough, I thought the one single choice you have to make in the entire game was probably one of the most poignant moments in any game I have played. It was incredibly difficult to make and left me with a real lasting impression and that feeling in the pit of my stomach that made me wonder whether the decision was the right one or not.\nBe warned: this game is meant to be played through in big chunks, shown by an ending that has so much impact if you have been following the plot and really immersing yourself. If you play this game in small portions then the atmosphere, plot and impact will probably not hit as hard.\n\nStrap-up, blast off, and lose your sanity amongst the talking rubble and deathly-silent human clones.","March 19, 2014","true","4.6"," 60 of 63 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","60","63","0","3"

Good use of color/lighting.\n+Audio: Qualitative, effective, also eerie.\n+Music: Fantastic. Can be present or good background music.\n+Atmosphere: You will feel the isolation and mystery.\n+Animation: Very smooth.\n+Presentation: The menus and font are both beautiful and minimal.\n\nCons-None\n\nNeutral+/-Placement of clones can occasionally be finicky.\n\n======================================\nIntroductionThe Swapper is a puzzler game where you play a swapper, a swapper is a person who swaps places with clones, a clone is a person who is a copy of another person. Beyond that, not much is known about who you are in the beginning, or what those giant stone rocks called Watchers are, or even much about what the planet or facility you are at is for besides transporting said Watchers offworld for scientific research.\n\nGameplayThe gameplay in the swapper is downright clever, but features a few very simple mechanics that allow for a lot of depth considering, especially if you keep in mind how many controls there aren't. Most of your stay in The Swapper will be spent left and right clicking to make clones and take their place, and to undo a clone you only hae to touch it, pass a checkpoint, or kill it with gravity. The puzzles will often be sequence puzzles that revolve around beams of light that remove your ability to clone or swap with said clones in that area, although timing, boxes, and movement can definitely be involved. What gameplay there is that doesn't revolve around puzzles, primarily revolves around exploration or loregathering in a metroid fashion instead.\n\nGraphicsIn The Swapper, every aspect of visual interest is masterfully handled, from the lighting, shading, detail, colors, atmosphere, and ambience. There's a major industrial vibe, with a lot of purples, blues, and yellows thrown in. Occasionally there will be a lush green area, and the scarcity makes it all the more beautiful.\n\nI also have to give a shoutout to the menu systems, they're absolutely stunning and as minimal as can be, and I adore minimal styled anything. Really, though, in the end, The Swapper is a game where the graphics shine most when shined right into your eyes while playing, and you should definitely make sure this happens.\n\nAudioThe audio in The Swapper is downright effective, and will be unsettling, mysterious, calming, and frantic at the exact moment a need arises. While the audio can be sparse at times, that's a good thing, because it remains all the more impactful due to the feeling of isolation, mystery, and silence it can help to provide.\n\nConclusionIn the end, The Swapper deserves 5 stars in every category, it runs well, plays great, and looks amazing. There is atmosphere and mystery in buckets, and it will never make your brain hurt too much, but will still give it a stretch. It's one of the more innovative puzzlers I've had the pleasure of playing, as well as one of the better indie games I've ever played. Due to the level of polish, I can easily recommend this to EVERYONE. Have fun!\n\n======================================","June 29, 2015","true","8.4"," 53 of 60 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","53","60","3","1"

The Finnish duo hired Tom Jubert to write the script who also wrote other noteworthy indie games such as Penumbra and Faster Than Light.\n\nThe Swapper is a side-scrolling puzzle game with some occasional platforming elements and zero gravity segments. The players get their hands on the titular device almost immediately. The device has two functions, it can create up to four clones of the main character and it can then swap souls between each body. No matter which body the player controls, the clones will all mimic his actions. The puzzles mostly revolve around placing yourself and the clones in certain places to be able to reach the orbs that are necessary for powering the ship’s systems. The player’s progress is impeded by three types of light. Blue light prevents cloning, red light prevents swapping whereas the purple light prevents both. Later on the game also introduces gravity-based puzzles which offer a nice change of pace.\n\nThe puzzle design is absolutely superb, logical and perfectly balanced. Some of the puzzles may stump you a bit, but everything is manageable with a bit of logical thinking and simply trying out a few different ideas. The design is semi open ended. The ship is closed off at certain points which require the orbs to progress further, but for the most part, it’s up to you which room/puzzle you want to tackle first. If a certain puzzle is giving you problems, you can leave and try later, but finishing the game will require solving all puzzles and getting all the orbs.\n\nThe other major part of the game whose significance cannot be overstated are the production values. The entirety of the game’s assets were created from clay and other household materials which were then digitized into the game. The lighting and color palettes are mesmerizing. The art-style and sound design masterfully create an incredibly macabre atmosphere and a fantastic sense of desolation. This is further heightened by the narrative which is crafted in such a way that provides more questions than answers. It is a sort of philosophical theme of thought and soul versus matter and energy. Sometimes it veers to pretentiousness, but overall the writing is very good and will hold the player’s interest.\n\nSimply put, The Swapper is an astonishing achievement in both game design and visual arts rarely seen in the video game medium and it is easily the top representative of its respective genre.\n\n9 OUT OF 10 (SUPERB)","November 27, 2013","true","11.7"," 45 of 51 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","45","51","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lord2nd/recommended/231160/","Lord2nd","Speevy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lord2nd/","698 products in account","The Swapper is a wonderfully compelling title in which you have special abilities that allow you to solve puzzles.\n\nLike Portal, the central premise asks the question "How do I exist in two different places at the same time?" or "How do I reach the unreachable place?"  Where these games differ is that The Swapper takes the answer to this question quite literally.  You're given a gun that fires copies of your controlled character.  You can have up to four of these copies, and the clones move in tandem with you.  If you move one step forward, they move one step forward, and so forth.  You can also project your primary control into any one of them, provided you have a clear unobstructed shot at it.  Most of the puzzles revolve around this mechanic, as there's usually a task one clone has to perform to get it into a place where you can control it.  Only your primary character can collect the orbs that complete the puzzle.  What makes these puzzles tricky is that there are different areas that obstruct your various powers, making you think critically to evaluate what your clones will do.  For example, red lights will not allow you to project yourself into a clone, so you must either disable the red light with a switch or work around it.  Red light areas still allow you to project new clones, however.  Blue lights don't allow new clones, but you can project into existing clones.  Purple lights don't allow your powers to work at all.  Some puzzles use boxes, but most employ the switches that your clones must activate to manipulate the light areas.  Later in the game, you encounter gravity pods that create similar scenarios, only with upside down and rightside up clones doing the work.  A primary character can only create a clone that is standing as they are, so there's another layer of gameplay.\n\nAs you move through the game, there is a dark, foreboding atmosphere.  You're thrust into a sci-fi world of moral and philosophical conflict, and the story is told through a reluctant female voice as well as ship logs.  The game's visuals are beautifully realized with darkness and light interplaying in interesting ways.  Sound design is also uniformly excellent and realy creates this feeling of isolation and dread, yet you still feel this alien presence.  I will not spoil the story for you, but I will say that there are some surprising revelations that are not immediately apparent from the outset.  The environments are vast so there's plenty to explore.  I was reminded of Super Metroid at many times, except there is no combat in The Swapper.\n\nI think the game's controls and gameplay work wonderfully together to challenge the player without frustration.  So many indie titles only have their gimmick to fall back on, but The Swapper combines gameplay, visuals, and narrative seamlessly.  Even if you fail to understand how to solve a puzzle, there are plenty of puzzles you can solve while you're thinking about the correct solution.  I normally get pretty impatient with puzzle games, but every puzzle in The Swapper is fair, logical, and rewarding.\n\nIn summary, this is a fantastic game that you should purchase if you have not purchased it already.  It has enough content to warrant whatever price you pay for it, and should satisfy even the most jaded indie fans.","July 11, 2014","true","16.0"," 31 of 33 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","31","33","0","0"

The Swapper can be described as a metaphysical journey into the realms of mind, set in a dark sci-fi environment. We are undertaking a trip to understand the importance of the "self". This is achieved by challeging the player through puzzles that involves the use of the "Swapper", a device which beholds the power to create clones of itself. While the puzzles get more and more complex and thus bringing out the infinite possibilities that the "Swapper" gives, the game brings us various queries. How can the self be multiplied? Who is the real "self"? Those are some of the questions only the player can answer.\nI recommend The Swapper to people who love Braid and similar titles and to every people who are searching for a videogame that can be challeging in a different way.\n\n7,5/10","December 5, 2013","true","5.3"," 41 of 55 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","41","55","0","2"

Developed and published by indie Facepalm Games, and partly funded by Indie Fund, the game is a sci-fi puzzle-platformer with exploration elements; it has traits of metroidvania and the gameplay is reminiscent of Braid. Among the awards won are: Indie Game Challenge, IndieCade Special Recognition, and Indie Showcase Develop Conference. The Swapper is available for PC on Steam, PlayStation 3 & 4, and PlayStation Vita.\n\n\nStory:Set on a space-station orbiting a planet far-off in outer space, isolated from civilization, devoid of people and with much environmental storytelling, the space-station is filled with atmospheric dread. It begins with an unnamed character entering the space-station and finding a device that allows her to clone herself and to swap consciousness between those clones. She encounters someone who constantly contradicts herself and who functions as a guide.\n\nAs one progresses through the game it is revealed that humans have exhausted their resources, and have established seven outposts orbiting planets in distant outer space to extract and synthesize materials to send back to earth. These outposts must survive independently for decades; the one our protagonist is on is called Theseus, and it orbits a planet named Chori V which is abundant in minerals such as a more durable steel amalgam.\n\nOn Chori V there are sentient rocks that speak to you about concepts of thought, physical existence, and metaphysical existence; scientists dubbed these beings The Watchers. The Watchers observed how humans lived on the space-station, they looked on as they argued over complex concepts like the ones mentioned above. The Watchers have an apparent connected network of thoughts, revealed by discoveries of electrochemical activity within them, and have been extracted and studied by the scientists to understand more about consciousness, resulting in the swapper device. Further progression reveals what happened to the space-station workers, what role The Watchers had in that, and ethical disagreements between the scientists.\n\n\nGameplay:The gameplay mechanic is directly linked with its larger-than-life themes of consciousness, identity, and thought, and the story itself; the swapper device is at the core of the game. The device lets the player create clones and swap their consciousness between them. You can make up to four clones and control them all at the same time, swapping through them determines which one is the ‘original’. The platforming aspect of the game is fairly straight-forward, you’ll have to jump and walk on platforms, sometimes using timing, and will interacts with various aspects of the environments, such as lifts.\n\nThere are light sources in the game that limit how much you can use the device. Red light prevents swapping between clones, while blue light prevents the creation of clones; the two lights overlapping (which results in purple light) prevents both. These lights play a big role in the puzzles of the game, which consist of using your clones to acquire orbs that open more areas of the map. The puzzles begin fairly simple, becoming harder as you progress more and more, in the end turning into complex puzzles that might take you a relatively long time to figure out (I got stuck in one of the final puzzles for an hour) but it’s never infuriating; the puzzles themselves are ingeniously designed, and along with a fair bit of logical thinking, require complete and total use of the swapper device.\n\nThe map is redolent of metroidvania-style games, where one may have to advance and go back to ultimately reach a final destination. There are teleportation devices that give the player more accessibility to come from and go to previously visited locations in the map.\n\n\nVisual:This game is very special when it comes to graphics. Instead of using digitally made textures and 3D models, the environments in the game are handcrafted; clay models were used for the levels. That’s not to say there’s nothing digital involved in the making of the game, it is a videogame after all. Nevertheless, the game never fails to portray itself how it wants to, and the mixed media results in a very atmospheric ambience. The Swapper is relatively casual with its visuals, but once you focus on details you can see the work and effort put into making this game as beautiful as possible.\n\n\nSound:The best part about The Swapper’s audio was definitely the voice acting, though the sound effects and soundtrack succeeded in completing the atmosphere of the whole game. The quietness, and the sound of nothing but your footsteps really brings the abandoned feel to life. When the game wants to be dramatic and convey a feeling of impending doom, it achieves it. In its entirety, the sound is the icing on the cake for this one.\n\n\nFinal Thoughts:Are you still you after cloning yourself? Are you the clone or the original? When swapping your consciousness into a clone, is it still you? Does your soul stay intact? These are some big questions that entail a drive to possess comprehension on a much higher level than humans currently have, or might even be capable of. The themes of sentience, thought, consciousness, soul, and identity are what the game is all about. The Swapper explores these questions through its sole gameplay mechanic: swapping your consciousness into a clone.\n\nThe fact that the swapper device exists raises some ethical and philosophical questions as well. Throughout the whole story, as the puzzles become harder the story also becomes more intense, characters begin to question one another, building up the tension and the magnitude of its themes with its vocabulary and carefully paced narrative. At the end of the game you get to make a choice, it’s unexpected that they place this decision in front of you. It’s a hard decision to make, and the unexpectedness of it made me immediately think carefully about what I would really do, and I did… This game is much more profound than I expected it to be. It caught me off guard, it was one of those experiences that make you rethink many things, like finishing a book and being left with a big message that’s for you to interpret and figure out how to feel about, and how to come to terms with it.\n\nI’m a fool for not playing it before!\nThe two main developers, Otto Hantula and Olli Harjola (who made this game in their spare time while in university), have made a truly special and unforgettable product right here.","May 28","true","7.3"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","22","23","0","7"

What I wasn't expecting was for it to draw me in so completely, after the matter of a few levels. The mechanics are pretty much what is described on the store page, that you can create a certain number of clones, and swap control between them. That's it. No unlocks, no level ups for harder puzzles. What you can do as you delve deeper into the empty space station, is what you've always been able to do. That's one thing I really admire about this game. It makes your brain unlock, your imagination of this simple tool unlock, instead of unlocking things for the tool itself.\n\nNow back to my favorite aspect, the immersion of this game. There are no doubt many games of an abandoned site, be it a space station or historical site, et cetera. The Swapper, drew me in. I felt so utterly small, so alone. There are logs to be found as to what befell the previous occupiers of the station, but I did not feel hope. The quiet sounds, and large space station was definitely too hallow for one. For this one explorer. Or a few. You find some consciousnesses that are just those, thoughts floating in a great atmosphere. (Vague I know, but you'll see.) This game makes you think, mechanic wise, and story wise, yet it's not really trying to make you think about the "story", but more of all the implications.\n\nOverall, this is an excellent, thought provoking game in execution, atmosphere, and puzzle mechanics. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and couldn't put it down.","January 12, 2015","true","10.6"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","19","20","0","0"

Taking the less is more approach (think Portal) there are only a small handful of mechanics to learn, but this is a feature that shows off nothing but careful and precise design. You are armed with a single device that allows you to create a few clones and switch which one you are controlling as the others follow your motions. Some lights deny either ability: one won't allow you to make clones, another won't allow you to switch control with them. Nothing more is needed to create the genuinely clever levels in The Swapper. The puzzles on display here challenge the player into utter confusion, and then elevate them as soon as the solution is found.\n\nBeing fascinating from start to finish is no small feat, and The Swapper makes it look effortless.\nAn eerie sci-fi setting, ethereal art, riddled words, and panicked voices all carry the enigmatic narrative of The Swapper. Aboard the ship of Theseus, stones speak madness, crew logs show failure and disarray, and a strange figure recedes further from you into the corridors of the ship. The questioned posed might be familiar for some, but the lens held here allows all players to engage it in a new way.  Playing with this idea as you chase answers in the halls of Theseus makes for an interesting backdrop.\n\nThe brief nature of the game might be enough to turn off some, but that is where pacing becomes important. No matter how good something is, it can outstay its welcome and The Swapper knows how to avoid this. The puzzles might slow you down a bit, but the hands of the game and story seem to guide you at just the proper rate to stay engrossed.\n\nThe Swapper is an amazing game full of mystery, depth, and great puzzles.

It's the moment shortly after you get the Swapper device where the game teaches you its potential. It does it in such an elegant way that it's a revelation; suddenly, the platform game you thought you were playing gets subverted, the possibilities seem vast, and the game exploits these possibilities in the various puzzles that it subsequently throws your way. To explain it would be to spoil it. There's a point in any puzzle game that I dread, though, and it's the point where it all becomes too much for my brain, where the developers start to throw the kitchen sink at you, and each puzzle becomes hard work rather than fun. In retrospect, The Swapper never really does this, but there were moments when faced with a seemingly impossible puzzle that my brain threw its figurative hands in the air and went off to sulk, muttering something about getting old. I admit that I had to look at a walkthrough for some of the later puzzles, the solutions to which are only elegant with hindsight. Still, I needed to progress because I needed to see how the story played out, touching as it does on life, morality and - momentarily - spirituality. The Swapper does a great job of drawing you into its cold, echoing world; it feels like Alien without the alien. The modelling style that's used to build the facility gives the game a unique look, realistic without being real, and the ethereal soundtrack completes the unsettling picture.","February 24, 2014","true","6.2"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/morganov/recommended/231160/","morganov","Plissken","http://steamcommunity.com/id/morganov/","361 products in account","I've just found a neat toy. Superficially it’s a strange-looking gun – with seemingly no visual clues as to its nature. Curious. I pick it up and pull the trigger expecting, as usual, some kind of interesting projectile. But rather than bullets, it materialises a human figure. It’s me! An identical copy – a clone. Surreal, I know. As I walk, he (it?) blindly mimics my action. Hmm, so more of an empty vessel then than any kind of a real person. I shoot again – my triplicate! Again – my quintuplet! I freestyle shooting up into the air. Just as before another appears only this time he is falling. His feet hit the floor first to an audible crack of bones. His limp body then collapses into a heap, lifeless. Air from his ruptured spacesuit hisses out. I stare into the middle distance. Suddenly I don’t feel quite so playful.\n\nWhat I do feel is uncomfortably disturbed and that, to its immense credit, is the feeling that The Swapper is able to evoke most vividly during its short but captivating journey into the heart of darkness. Right from the off, this unassuming piece hits you with the atmosphere – visuals that riff off 2001 and sound design that recalls the nervy ambiance of alien. But that’s just the introductory sequence. You then begin the lonely walk, first across the haunted landscape of a forgotten planet, and later ascending to the empty hulk of a ship haunted by some pitch black secrets.\n\nAs fast as the novelty passes you quickly become comfortable with the mechanics of cloning yourself and ‘Swapping’ your consciousness between bodies in order to traverse the environment. It’s a neat core mechanic giving The Swapper a fresh, fluid, quality to its movement. Indeed, zipping through the expansive habitats, crossing abyssal gorges and navigating labyrinthine death traps, could almost be mistaken for a liberating if it wasn’t for one uncomfortable necessity - Progression has never required such an unnatural disregard for personal safety and over the course of the game you will willingly sacrifice hundreds if not thousands of your cloned forms in order to reach the ultimate conclusion. The trick Swapper pulls is in building your familiarity with the mechanic of sacrificial progression without ever truly answering the questions it raises regarding the soul.\n\nOnce this nervy backdrop is established Swapper starts hitting a rhythm that somewhat recalls the majesty of the original portal - A masterful build-up of complexity orchestrated with the deepening overture of its narrative that makes for a rich, compelling symphony. New mechanics are deftly introduced and then layered onto the ever multiplying permutations of complex puzzle solving - The simultaneous clone limit, the gravity switches, the very portal-esque red and blue light filters, composing the constituent parts which are each time are combined in ever perplexing arrangements.\n\nWhat this all adds up to is a well-crafted deftly told science fiction short story. Not an extravaganza, not expansive world building, but the evocation of a distinct journey against a mood of dread and isolation. While Swapper succeeds on many technical and gameplay levels, the real magic of this experience is one that harkens back to an unsettled feeling, that first encounter with the swapper device itself and the sense of morose revelation as its true nature becomes apparent. Some have said this could be the perfect game. While I am hesitant to agree entirely, I can definitely see their reasoning – engaging gameplay built on rock solid mechanics, rich absorbing visuals and a feeling like standing on the edge of a dark precipice that doesn't quickly leave you. In truth – I don’t think it’s far off.\n\nIf you liked that piece check out my game review site:\nhttp://tonnochi.blogspot.co.uk/\nThanks for reading.

In fact of all games I played this year I can hardly find one I enjoyed more than this one! The 97% positive reviews are absolutely justified in my opinion and I concur with them.\n\n«The Swapper» is a 2D-puzzle-platformer embedded in a very elaborate, immersive and well narrated story. Actually it's some kind of a combination of a SciFi-short-story and a tricky platformer game - with a strong and intelligent connection between these two aspects (see below).\n\n☛ Have a look at the screenshots in my profile for a few impressions of the graphics, art design, atmosphere and puzzle design of «The Swapper».\n\n\n❖ Story and gameplay:\n\nAlmost like in a SciFi movie...You are alone on an empty space station, "Theseus", with no idea what happened and have to find your way through a labyrinth of its rooms and corridors in order to find out what's going on there. In the very beginning you already notice that is has to be something really weird since you "hear" telepathic voices talking to you every time you pass one of these huge stones that are scattered around the whole station. And what they say is more confusing than explaining... at first.\n\nTo overcome the various obstacles in the station you have a device (the "swapper") which enables you to create clones of yourself and to take control of them. And since you are alone on the station but the puzzles can only be solved in teamwork you need those clones, though their coordination can get tricky because your clones can't be moved independently from yourself and each other, they always do the exact same things you do, at the exact same time - but you can choose where to position a new clone and which of the clones defines what the others imitate. In order to create some kind of teamwork between these different 'You's you have to think outside the box sometimes.\n\nDuring your journey through the station you regularly pass data-terminals, which contain one file each, a log-entry, a letter, a protocol, a report and such, and reveal one by one the fascinating story of the stations history and give you piece by piece the whole picture of what happened on Theseus.\n(These files are relatively short though, it's not that you have to read through long texts, they are just so well-written and designed that the story that builds up in your mind around these little chunks of information is pretty complex in the end. Big compliment to the authors of the game btw.)\n\nGreat story! ✿\n\n\n\n❖ Technical stuff:\n\n☑ Very pleasant, smooth game mechanics (AD: left and right, space/W: jump, e: interact, q: map, f: log, mouse-movement: look around, right/leftclick: clone/swap (use swapper-device), mouse-movement while holding right klick: position clone (use swapper device))\n☑ Good graphics, beautiful graphical art design\n☑ Sound nothing special, but  nice and supports the atmosphere very well\n☑ Professional voice acting\n☑ Puzzles/obstacles are designed very intelligently, easy in the beginning but quite complex and tricky in the end - and not repetitive\n☑ Two different endings\n☑ No glitches/bugs encountered\n\n\n☛ One CON to mention:\nOnce you hit the last console and the ending sequence starts you reach a point of no return. During this ending scene you have to make a decision that defines the ending (out of two possibilities). After the game finished you have no chance to return to a certain chapter or even just some point before the ending sequence. If you would like to play through the other ending as well you would have to play through the whole game again.\nIn the forums the devs stated, that they intentionally chose to do it this way and even not to warn the player of the point of no return - they wanted to make your final decision... well, really a final one.\nFor me personally it's a con that you can't jump to particular chapters of the game after finishing it. You have no choice than to watch the other ending on youtube (if you dont want to play the whole game all over again) and that also complicates the achievement-hunting, since you have to play through the whole game again if you lack just one achievement at the very end of the game. So make sure to get all achievements in your first playthrough and in the correct order (achievements unlock by encountering hidden rooms that can only be found with the swapper by projecting a clone into walls - once you find a hidden passage this suddenly works, usually it doesn't).\n\nOn the other hand: It isn't really a pain in the a▒s to play through the game a second time. Of course it's a little tedious to replay the puzzles you already solved once again (though there are enough of them and they partly look this similar (just "look".. in fact they aren't) that you easily forget about the trickier ones soon) but by your new knowledge about the whole story and the complete history of the station you get a new understanding of the early telepathic messages and files that just confused you when you heard/read them the first time. Like when you watch a movie a second time and suddenly understand and notice things that had no meaning to you while you first watched them. Quite interesting.\nI personally did it this way, I played the game twice. To play through both endings, to get some lacking achievements and to get another view on the early parts of the game. And I enjoyed both playthroughs.\n\n\n\n❖ Specials:\n\nWhat I especially liked about this game is the fact, that the game mechanics > the way you move through the station (with the "swapper" device) is strongly interwoven with the story.\nUsually in puzzle-platformers you have 1) a world full of the inevitable tricky puzzles in which you move 2) some special gadget or ability to overcome these obstacles (eg. this portal-device or the ability to shift the world around you or to jump extremely high etc.) and (at least if it's a good game) 3) a story that is told during you search your way through this world with this gadget/ability - but these things are normally three seperated elements of the game... or at least 2) is seperated.\nThat you have this special device or ability to move around in the given map doesn't have a particular meaning, it's just the way it is, the way it has to be for the player to be able to solve the puzzles/overcome the obstacles. It doesn't matter why you have this "wormwhole"-creator-pistol in "Portal", someone developed it and gave it to you, because that's how the game is supposed to work, period. It doesn't matter why you have the ability to turn the world around yourself in "And Yet It Moves", you just have it because otherwise you wouldn't be able to move through the map at all.\n\nIn "The Swapper" it's different; your special device (swapper-device) and ability (telepathy) arent "just there" ("because it has to be this way to solve the given puzzles"), but the world around you and the story which is revealed by the time explain where this device/ability is coming from. Story and mechanics are interwoven.\n\n\n\n❖ Fazit:\n\nIf you dont bother reading all the data-files youll get a immersive SciFi short-story along with a great puzzle-platformer.\nBut even if you dont like reading so much, you can still enjoy this game as a well designed puzzle-platformer. (But in this case it isn't an overwhelmingly great game anymore but just a normal, good puzzle-platformer. What makes this game special and legitimates this enthusiastic review is the story.)\n\nRecommended in both cases - though I really recommend to spend some time in reading and not to skip the story - it's the best aspect of the game and especially the connection between gameplay and story makes this game so special.\n\n\nBuy «The Swapper» - It's worth it!\n❊ 10/10 ❊","December 11, 2015","true","28.7"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","19","22","0","3"

How? When? There are two things that make this title so awesome that I put aside my unredeemable hatred for this type of games.\n\nFirst one is a atmosphere. The Swapper really nails down few interesting themes that are associated with a sci-fi fiction - a creepy loneliness of space. You are on the research space station. Ambient noises comes from empty sections of the deck. Where everybody went? What happened here? The use of light, music and amazing claymotion-esque graphics is nearly perfect and you sit on the edge of your chair, even when this game isn’t a horror one. The plot, told mostly in the Bioshock manner, is really a thought-provoking, especially and the end. Presentation, story - crafted and tied together with mechanics, work well for the overall feel of the game.\n\nSecond - The puzzles. This is probably the first puzzle-platformer when I wasn't forced to use a guide and game managed to keep with the high difficulty of the challenge. In one way it shows how many developers screwed up this aspect of their games. In the other: it's a really impressive feat from the creators of The Swapper. The cloning device does not look interesting on the first glance, but the Portal-like philosophy of puzzle design in simple-yet-convoluted “test” chambers works here. Game doesn't throw at you new mechanics often, but it shows how much you can squeeze out of something you already have. I think there is only one puzzle room that is not that great but it is only a single unsalted pretzel in the full basket of goodies.\n\nThe device you use in the game is nicely wielded to the plot, but unfortunately the chambers and orbs that are the remaining main "actors" of all the puzzles in the game, aren't. There is no story explanation of those things and I count this a lost opportunity to amplify the immersion even more. Also, one may be really frustrated when the game shows the information that all in-game chambers must be solved in order to see the ending sequence. In the first locations there is an wrong assumption that you don't need to grab all orbs on your way. This can upset some people when it shows up, so keep that in mind.\n\nI extremely recommend this game, especially for those who liked Bioshock, Portal or sci-fi games in general. If you liked other indie-puzzle game then this game will show you how to craft not only a good game, but also a amazing interactive experience.\n\nWell... It looks like the puzzle-plaftormer genre IS salvageable after all...","April 7, 2014","true","7.6"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

The art style is very unique (rendered from clay models) and deserving of the accolades, and the soundtrack enhances the barren ship environment.  The majority of the gameplay is solving puzzles in rooms with your clone(s) but just navigating around the ship is a fun ride and there is a perfectly implemented map that helps you always know where you are.  There is a deeper story that's fairly solid if you let go a little bit, but it doesn't require you to get too "indie philosophical" to enjoy it.  The challenges are really rewarding because there isn't any hand-holding.  In that way the solutions get harder and edge close to being obscure some times, but they never cross that line and they always prove to be "fair" once you see the answer.\nThere's just something about the game's style coupled with how effortless and responsive the controls are that make it stand out.  If you are looking for something different, this is one of those (critically acclaimed) indie games to put at the top of your back-log list, and one to play before you dive into your next AAA first-person game.","October 14, 2014","true","12.4"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","0"

This game is first and foremost a puzzle game with brainteasers that can stump even the most clever players. You control an unidentified astronaut who finds “the swapper device”, a beam gun that can create up to four clones of yourself and swap control between any of them. Your clones mirror your movements, allowing you to solve complicated puzzles onboard Space Station Theseus. There are no enemies, only puzzle elements such as lights that disable your swapper and gravity reversal pads.\n\n- Visuals -\nThe game is entirely 2-D with bloom, soft shading, ambient blur and simply gorgeous graphics. The space station feels cold and empty, bathed in blue until you run across the gardens and greenhouses which are bright and full of life. The visuals reinforce a feeling of isolation the setting provides. Many of the objects were handcrafted out of clay and other materials before digitization.\n\n- Audio -\nThe sound effects are nothing special but good. The menu theme is slow and emotional, setting the tone of the entire game. Most of the background music is a low drone, but there are a few sections where a soft piano plays a sad melody. I stopped just to listen to these songs during my first playthrough.\n\n- Puzzles -\nGame progress is limited by gates that require a number of security orbs in order to open. These orbs can be acquired by solving puzzles, which scale in difficulty from the start of The Swapper to its finish. Teleport stations are unlocked as you progress, which makes backtracking much faster. The achievements are all secret (Hint: some walls aren’t as solid as they look).\n\n- Plot - (spoiler-free)\nSince I can’t tell you nearly anything about the story without spoiling something, this will be brief. The game progresses the story through cinematic cutscenes and lore messages you can pick up from marked terminals, as well as other sources. There are multiple endings and you will have to play through a couple times in order to understand the story.\n\n- My Thoughts -\nThis game plays like a “Metroidvania” game; backtracking exists but is hardly necessary. I gave it my highest rating because I really enjoyed being stumped by the puzzles and being confused by the intricate story, then figuring them out and finally understanding what was going on. It’s a hard puzzler and a walkthrough does help at points. I got this on sale, but I’d say that it’s worth the full price of $15. Buy this, solve puzzles and have fun!\n\nNot Recommended\nRecommended With Caution\nRecommended\nHighly Recommended\n- Recommended as Essential","May 14","true","12.7"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

Being alone in a big empty ship provided a sense of creepiness similar to Dead Space, but instead of action and horror elements, there are puzzles to be solved by making hollow clones of yourself and transferring your consciousness to any one of those empty bodies. The story is very science fiction and extremely weird. The puzzles are pretty easy for the most part, but there was one at the end with four buttons that just stumped the hell out of me. Although fairly short, The Swapper is an extremely solid puzzle platformer--a great addition to the genre.","February 21, 2014","true","6.0"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

(not like portal where you are pretty much stuck until you finish)\n\nGameplay BasicsThis might give you a better idea on how the game works, in case you were wondering whether or not to buy it!\nSpoilers will be noted\n\nMOVEMENT:\nA: walk left\nD: walk right\ntap W: small jump\nHold W: higher jump\nI suggest binding the jump key to SpaceBar tho :3\n\nQ: I’m the map I’m the map I’m the map I’m the map!\n\nCLONING: (hold) Mouse 2\nYou can clone yourself, wherever you want, with the SWAPPER DEVICE.\nYou can make 4 clones at most, including yourself, there can be 5 people on the screen.\nAll clones will follow your movements (walk left,right jump), until they hit a wall or an obstacle.\nWhen you deploy a clone, you are in a slow-motion state.\nClones will only be deployed in the state you are in (upright -> upright) (upside down -> upside down)\n\nSWAPPING: Mouse 1\nYou can swap / teleport your soul (main player) to any of the other clones. if there are 2 clones together, it will hit the first one the swapper beam touches.\nYou can swap in mid air.\nWhen your clone is upside down, you will be swapped to the upside down state as well.\n\nRETRIEVING YOUR CLONE: Touch the darn thing\nif you walk into your own clone, you will take it back. (But only if your "soul" is one of the clones!! If none of the clones are the player himself, they will not colide into one)\n\nOBSTACLES:\nBoxes: Drag with E, push with booty ;)\nBlue light: Cannot spawn clone within, you can still teleport through or within it.\nRed light: Cannot teleport in it or even TROUGH it, you can spawn a clone anywhere in it.\nPurple = Cons of Blue + Red : Can't clone inside, can teleport thru it or in it = you are f**king screwed ;-;\nButtons: These babes open doors and turn off lights.\n\n\n\nSpoilers: Tips and Tricks  If you hold down onto the button, time goes into slow-motion, meaning you can make clones in the sky, teleport to them, and make a new clone, swap to them, on and on, you can gain incredible hights\n\nBoxes can block a door from shutting!\n\nIf you hit a wall but still press the A and D key, your clones will still walk, use this to change the distances between yourselves\n\nBy jumping, you can get closer to your clone, when she is upside down and you are upright, use it well ;)\n\nThis one... is so special to me, cause it took me a while to figure out, but REMEMBER, if you touch your clone, you take it back, including when you are upside down and he is upright! vis versa!\nAlso, this can happen by jumping between a low ceiling, or even SPAWNING your clone on top of another, Good luck ;)\n\nTook me about 8-9 hours to finish, but then you realize , wait, there are secrets too?! (The achievements)\nSo, this game has got some replay value to it! There are also many ways to complete most levels.\nYou can make different in-game accounts to play the whole story over again.\nSadly, once a level is finished, you can’t start it over, you will have to make a new in-game account… and proceed thru the story until you get there =-=….why…\n\nAlright, typed quite a lot, as you can see how much I love this game, it must be pretty ***damn addicting!\nSo what are you waiting for ;) ?","May 9","true","9.6"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","13","15","0","5"

The game looks absolutely gorgeous, and the story is interesting and fairly well delivered, with the rare encounters with other people on board the ship each being mysterious and memorable. Having said that, the text files accessible around the ship don't do the best job of explaining some of the backstory - or perhaps I missed something crucial.\n\nThe central puzzle mechanic is very clever, and the difficulty scales perfectly - so that every room feels manageable, but you'll still struggle (in a good way) to have that moment of clarity and realization. The game seems to love to make you think "I'm one clone short of being able to complete this puzzle...."  But as soon as I thought of (or stumbled upon!) the solution to every one of the later rooms, I found myself thinking "Oh damn, its been staring me in the face this entire time!" They always manage to do new things with the puzzles and keep it very different, no puzzle is a repeat of any other, and they'll all challenge you in different ways, particularly when they start introducing new environmental mechanics and features! Additionally, the first time you realize the Swapper gun's uses not just in puzzles but also in travelling large chasms and spaces is a joy, and it feels great to travel fast using the gun (if easy to mess up!)\n\nThe story is captivating by itself -- (it took me until embarassingly late in my playthrough to notice that some of the characters were named after 20th/21st century philosophers of mind, and the ship is named Theseus for a reason..)  But what is absolutely interesting is how the central gameplay mechanic of being able to create clones and then "swap your souls around" is slowly related back to the player.  Think of the game as an extended thought experiment -- in order for this to be possible, what would personal identity and the mind have to really amount to?\n\nWhen you first progress in the game as one of the clones, and leave the original you as a corpse on the floor, it's disconcerting, but it quickly becomes a simple habit, and you'll go through hundreds and hundreds of clones without thinking at all about any of them. It's at the end that this action which has become trivial is suddenly recontextualized. It then uses these thoughts about personal identity and the mind to say something quite unique about the player's role in the narrative.\n\nAnd the ending, which I absolutely do not want to spoil,  is perfect in tone.","December 28, 2013","true","1.7"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

I saw a thread about it a couple of weeks ago with the announcement that it was coming to Steam. The graphics looked gorgeous but I didn't quite know what to expect from the game itself. Now I know. Let me just say that The Swapper blew me away.\n\nAt its heart the game is a puzzle platformer, with an atmosphere that will remind most of us of Dead Space. Your character's suit and a few zero-gravity parts also reminded me of it.\n\nThe graphics are extremely beautiful and moody. It has a bit of a fuzzy look, but man, does it look good in motion. I read somewhere that it used clay for some of the environments. I can't confirm this, as it's very well done in that case, but the idea behind is cool. Yes, it has been used in several other games but nowhere near as subtle as in The Swapper.\n\nThe puzzles are well made. A few of them are exceptionally hard, but this also depends on the person that plays it obviously. I thought it had a nice mix of easy, medium and hard puzzles. It's all about swapping between you and your clones, hence the title.\n\nThe story itself is pretty deep, even though it's all about swapping. There are several rocks located throughout the world and all of them will give you a tiny bit of information, and there are computers with log files as well. Near the end of the game things will become more clear.\n\nThe Swapper isn't necessarily a long game. It might take an average person between 5 or 7 hours. A bit short for such a wonderful game. Let's hope it does well enough to give us some sort of sequel in the future.\n\nFor now, go buy The Swapper as it's one brilliant game.

It proved to be an excellent puzzle platform game with excellent puzzles, excellent gameplay, a good atmosphere, and an intrigueing story. The art style is unique, but very well done as I think it suits the game and it's atmosphere. And to further add to that, I believe the soundtrack to be something pretty nice that also suits the atmosphere and setting of the game as well, with takes place aboard a space station in space. The puzzles in this game are definitely noteworthy and something not to think of lightly. They provide quite a challenge. Not an impossible, frustrating challenge, but a good challenge that really gets you to actually think and want to push to get the puzzle done. I had my fair share of stumps where some puzzles took me quite awhile to figure out, but I managed them in the end. Adding on to the puzzles, I also found gameplay to be another great feature of this game as well. Basically, the main feature and what this game revolves around is the Swapper device, which enables you to make clones, swap with them, etc. It's something fresh and interesting brought to the table of game mechanics. The story should also not be taken lightly either. A story if looked into enough by paying attention to the game, collecting logs, and actually thinking about it, is something that's pretty deep, good, and thought-provoking. I know it did have an effect on my emotions, which is something I really appreciate when a video game is able to do that to me.\n\nThis is a game that definitely deserves a lot of praise. It's a great, beautiful game that was not only a lot of fun to play, but also appreciate things like it's story, philosophical-related stuff, atmosphere, and more. I can easily see myself coming back to this game to play again down the road and would have no issues at all with another playthrough of it. It took me about a solid seven hours to complete the game, which I think was a decent length. Overall, my hat goes off to this game.

Done in only two sessions and two days. Really shows how much it grabbed me more than anything else. I found the length to be perfect. Just ended before it became a trudge. Almost ten hours is a good length, even more when the puzzles never repeated or even got too similar. Each has its own "feeling".\n\nWhat can I say? It all clicked very well with me. The visual style is not only beautiful but adds to the cryptic world building and desolate tone. Controls were perfect and it is just nice to learn new tactics and moves with the same basic mechanics.\nPuzzles almost never were a forgettable breeze, neither frustrating. That made me especially glad, since I usually don't play puzzle games. Kinda proud that I managed to solve every room on my own. All besides three measly puzzles. Bit my teeth off at those many times but once it became frustrating I called it a day and looked them up. It's fine though. Two of those had a similar gist to it which I don't think I'd come up with. And the other one was a bit cheap-ish.\nOnce done with all rooms, I saw a guide explaining the secret rooms. They have terminals and even though I loved reading them and learning more about the world, accessing them is a bit stupid done. Reading a guide to get to them would break immersion, so I skipped them. Ending was great.\n\nTotally recommend giving it a shot.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateGodfrey/recommended/231160/","PrivateGodfrey","Captain MooMoos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateGodfrey/","490 products in account","This is a long review, so if you want to read why I recommend The Swapper just skip to Results and read from there.\n\nFacepalm Games chooses a winner with The Swapper. The Swapper is an amazing puzzle game where you play as an astronaut who enters into a research station.  The station is eerily empty; keeping you constantly wondering what went wrong. Throughout your exploration you find only one other person who seems relatively unstable and an abundance of space rocks. Although unlike normal rocks you quickly figure out that these ones can communicate. Will you make it off the ship or will you die a painful death. The Swapper will keep you wanting to survive, but only if you throw away your morals.\n\nGameplay:\nThe Swapper is a puzzle game where you must use a device “The Swapper” to create clones. These clones have no mind of their own and move the exact same way as you, except in a different space. You can use “The Swapper” to throw your soul between the clones and chance who you are in control of. At the touch of a button all the clones can disappear leaving your original self behind. These game implements a variety of features which keep the game riveting without being repetitive: jumping sequences, fast swap requirements, gravity changes, switches, insightful dialogue, amazing story, incredibly beautiful ambience, and a scary take on the ideas of reality. Are we really the whole person or just a vessel for our mind?\n\nGame Mechanics:\nThe controls are incredibly simple, easy to use, and make for a pleasant experience. You will learn quickly that while using features of the swapper slows down time and space allowing you to pull of relatively complex moves through short time spans. There will be many times where you will jump off a cliff knowing you will die just to use a clone you created right before you hit the bottom. The puzzles are complex, require precise timing, and may require you to use every single one of your clones. I actually 100% completed this game, although I am not sure why but Steam decided to not give me the last four achievements. I would get them again, but once you complete this game you cannot go back. So in order to play again you must start from the beginning, but the positive is if you want the achievements but haven’t got them you can go through every part of the game and find them before you activate the end sequence. If you can’t tell the achievements are secret areas in the game, each of them every difficult to find. Each achievement also unlocks secret computer terminals which provide additional information. If you are a game hunter you can find them all yourself, but if you are interested in what the terminals say you can easily find very effective guides online.\n\nResults:\nThe Swapper is a great game, it keeps you on your toes and makes you wanting more. For $14.99 it is a bit expensive and I am not sure if I would recommend paying that price unless you have the money to spare. Although if you are more frugal, like myself, I would wait till this title is one sale. If you can get the Swapper for under $10.00 it’s completely worth every penny. This game offers so much in such a little package: brilliant dialogue, amazing story development, beautiful atmosphere, wonderful puzzles, interesting concepts, fantastic character controls, and amazing achievements.\n\nPros:\n+Fantastic controls\n+Great atmosphere, environment, ambience, and world depth\n+Challenging puzzles with a variety of different features.\n+Really interesting game map\n+Intelligent dialogue that gets you to think.\n+The perfect length; The Swapper is not too short but also not too long.\n\nCons:\n-After completing the game you must start a new file if you want to go through the ship again (you cannot load any save files as this game has only one save file).\n-Not great if you have a multi-person household, because it has only one save file this means only one person can play the game at any given time.","March 27, 2014","true","6.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It's easy to get into, but challenging to master. Of course, additional gameplay elements are introduced over time to always keep you interested.\n\nThe quality of the game is just top-notch. Everything looks slick, physics are fine, controls and menus are very convenient, no bugs, amazing performance, even on Linux.\nThe story is very good sci-fi, no comments here.\n\nThis is not a very long game, but not too short either.

The device, while not terribly impressive at first, soon has you traveling vertically, leaving a trail of discarded clones to fall to their death as you transfer your consciousness from one clone to the next in order to get to otherwise impossible to reach locations.\n\nYou’ll soon realize that your clones are useful tools needed to help you solve the various puzzles in the game. They will jump when you jump, and move in whatever direction you move in. You are almost always required to sacrifice the clones in order to progress to the next section of the game, and the implications of this are tied beautifully into the story. All the puzzles are based around using these clones, be it to press a button at the right time, or standing in strategic positions to swap to, in order to navigate the room.\n\nNow this may sound easy, and it is at first, presenting problems which only take a minute or two to figure out, but with the introduction of different colored lights, which prevent certain actions (like creating new clones, or transferring your consciousness though the space the light occupies), the game becomes a lot harder, and by the end you could be staring at your screen for quite a while before coming up with a solution.\n\nSome puzzles will be so hard that you may find yourself wondering if the puzzle is even possible to solve at first. This is in large part due to the rarity of puzzles that simply build on the last challenge you just solved, meaning you’ll have to continually think of new ways to use your clones in order to progress.\n\nWhile this may sound frustrating, it is negated by the fact that when you do finally figure out the solution, and grab the Trigon Orbs needed to unlock the next section of the game, it often leads to moments of incredible satisfaction, which is a rare thing these days.\n\nThe soundtrack doesn’t really stand out in any way, but it fits the game well, and enforces the spooky loneliness of the vast space station you’re exploring, and, while it’s not something I’d want to listen to on its own, it does the job well enough to be mentioned.\n\nOverall, this is a game that demands more of its players, and treats them as capable puzzle solvers right from the start. It may not be for everyone, but what the game does, it does incredibly well, and the 4-5 hours gameplay ensures that it doesn’t overstay its welcome.\n\nThe game is quite innovative, and definitely worth trying, but unless you’re a hardcore puzzle gamer fan, I’d wait for a discount before checking it out.","December 4, 2013","true","4.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Do clones – copies of copies as it were – have consciousness? What is death for? Perhaps it’s for avoiding something, for a short time at least…\n\nYou don’t see these types of questions in video games all too often and for that, The Swapper immediately gets a strong nod from this writer.\n\nSpace Station Theseus is where your character – who has no name, or voice – stumbles upon. She finds an empty station that has been all but completely deserted save one other scientist, who seems busy doing something else, too busy for you at the moment.\n\nThe Swapper gun is discovered among the rubble of creepily empty rooms, and this is where the true gameplay starts kicking into gear.\n\nswap4times\n\nThere can only be four clones at a time, and you can swap between them all as you wish, provided that blue or red (blue prevents creating clones, red from swapping into them) lights aren’t blocking your way. The puzzles are very Portal-esque and will sometimes bust your brain when you figure out the obvious solution that you had completely overlooked.\n\nAs you complete these puzzles and acquire more orbs (which allow you to unlock deeper sections of the station), the story of what happened here starts to become much clearer. You’ll get the chance – if you want – to read up on little holo-terminals about the crew and what it was going through while on their seven year expedition. As the story progresses there are additional dialogues – greatly voiced by the way – from the lone scientist, and you begin to understand more of what she is desperately trying to do.\n\nYou see, as you explore the station, you will come across many of these almost-sentient rocks dubbed “The Watchers”, who, when passed by, will have something to say via shaky text pop-ups. The Watchers are critical to what the scientists on board Theseus were trying to accomplish. And the more Watchers you inevitably delve into the thoughts of, the creepier the whole situation gets.\n\nscreaminside\n\nI can’t shake off the creepiness after having finished the game. Everything about the station is… not right, and I approached each puzzle with determination to find out more of what had been going on here.\n\nThe level of atmosphere in The Swapper is remarkable, astounding even, considering the low-budget small indie developer Facepalm Games and what they had to work with. Similar to the original Star Wars movie though, that budget tightness may have been more a benefit than a flaw. Levels and characters have all been made from real-life clay and other materials that give the game a very realistic and almost touchable quality to them.\n\nAs the game ends and you make one of two very difficult choices, you’re left with a deep and hollow cathartic melancholy. Or at least I thought it was. I sort of sat there as the credits rolled and started thinking, sort of pondering questions about life and acknowledging the shakes I was feeling across my chest.\n\nI can’t give this game enough praise, honestly, and for me the only thing holding this back from being perfect is the sheer challenge of the puzzles at times. But I think that more adds to the charm of The Swapper, especially when those puzzles are backed with such a deep and smoothly told story. If you have a spare five hours, and some familiarity with thinking-outside-the-box, do pick this up.\n\nleviathyn.com","March 6, 2014","true","8.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

You enter rooms, solve the puzzles and get orbs to proceed to new rooms, in the tried and true metroidvania fashion. Except there are no enemies and everything is kinda dark and gloomy all the time.\n\nThe plot is also  bit of a mindbender at times, but whether it will give you "pause for thought" (Destructoid) or make you "ask questions about mortality and morality" (IGN) is somewhat debatable. The setting and the plot are certainly interesting, but I found the writing to be a little too obtuse at times, serving more of a cosmetic function and enabling the gameplay to evolve in strict accordance with the gameworld's inner logic. Furthermore, the puzzles, being the core of experience, also work towards killing many moments of immersion as the game rinses and repeats the same pacing pattern over and over again. Neither game nor story surprises you at any moment, the flow of everything is all to steady for that.\n\nStill, the puzzles were pretty good, save for a few exceptions, and the atmosphere that it built up, it kept and played out right until the credits began to roll.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/noibn/recommended/231160/","noibn","noibn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/noibn/","1756 products in account","Although it looks like a platformer, The Swapper is really a puzzle game at its core. And a fantastic one at that. You play as a survivor in a desolate space station, trying to find a way to escape. In order to do so, you have to solve a series of puzzles that involve creating clones of yourself. Using the "Swapper" device, you can create up to 4 clones, each of which duplicates your exact movements. Additionally, you can swap your consciousness to any clones that's within your line of sight (i.e. change the clone controlled by the player). But of course, there's a catch - light. Some rooms contain blue and/or red light. In blue light, clones can't be created, but can be swapped into; and in red light, clones can be created, but can't be swapped into. Put all of these elements together, and it's a mighty fine recipe for some mind-bending puzzles. The game starts off simple enough in order to introduce all of the mechanics, but once you've been taught what you need to know, get ready for a challenge. The level/puzzle design is nothing short of brilliant. You will get stuck at some point, but eventually the solution will click and you'll feel a real sense of accomplishment. There is nothing unfair about any of the challenges you'll face. It just comes down to you, patience, and working out the solutions. One cannot ask more from a puzzle game. Gameplay aside, The Swapper also excels in its presentation. The visuals (comprised of clay models) and music (which is minimal but great) combine to create an amazing atmosphere. Think Metroid by way of Alien, except there are no enemies to fight - only puzzles to solve. If you enjoy cerebral puzzle games, The Swapper is a no-brainer. This is absolutely one of the best games of its kind I have ever played, and that it was created by such a small team is extremely impressive. Check it out.\n\nFinal grade: A-\n\nTechnical notes: I played the game right at launch, and apparently there were some issues for a few people running the game. I encountered no problems myself, but you may just want to take a look at the discussion forum first to see if your PC could be affected (for instance I think Intel graphics don't currently work with it). Secondly, in terms of control method, while this may look like the type of game that would benefit from using a controller, I don't think that is the case. From my experience, mouse and keyboard is the most efficient, ideal control method. And finally, as far as gameplay, one thing to keep in mind is that the final 124 Orb door is a "point of no return". Once you enter the final area, your saved game will not be able to continue where you left off - only restart from scratch. So if you wish to explore the station to find any secrets or collect all the logs, make sure to to do so before opening the final door.","June 2, 2013","true","12.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rotane/recommended/231160/","rotane","`rotane","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rotane/","521 products in account","You take control of an amnesiac astronaut (how convenient) who wanders the dark corridors of a deserted space station, trying to make his way to… the end of the game, let's put it this way. His only tool is a device called the "Swapper" – a gun with the power to create clones of himself.\n\nAt its core the game is yet another puzzle platformer. But what makes it stand out is its unique graphic style and its compelling way of telling the story. The story itself is classic B-movie sci-fi (in the best sense of the term, i might add), and it is presented to you in snippets (log entries of crew members, cryptic messages that appear on your screen, slightly distorted voices via an intercom system) which you're meant to piece together as if a puzzle in itself.\n\nThen, the art style. Everything in the game had originally been modelled in clay and then scanned and photographed, which gives the world a unique and very distinct look. Add to that decent special effects (a beautiful mix of lights and shadows, subtle screen distortions, and the like) and excellent sound design to complete the experience. Music deserves a special recognition as well, as it is both subdued and hauntingly beautiful, and it is scarcely used, which only adds to the loneliness and melancholy of the place you'll find yourself in.\n\nThe most fascinating aspect of The Swapper is that the game mechanics perfectly mirror the story's central theme. Let me explain. When creating new clones of yourself, you can swap your consciousness into one of them and become the dominant one – and you will soon ask yourself (if you bother to think) "Who was the original self?". Which is just one of the questions that the story throws at you. And it stays true to itself until the very end, just like the mechanics do – you'll never level up or gain upgrades or any of that.\n\nAs a consequence to its simple nature, it is rather short. Depending on how good you are with the puzzles, you might be able to finish the game in 3–5 hours. But since it never deviates from its premise, it never gets boring.\n\nHighly recommended.\n\nP.S.: There is a small issue i'm having with this game, and that is its rather silly title. (Imagine Half-Life 2 being called "The Gravity Gun". That would've been equally silly.) While technically correct, it is highly unimaginative and does the game a disservice. This minor gripe aside, it is a game that you should definitely pick up and play in a preferrably dark and quiet environment.\n\nP.P.S.: You can listen to the soundtrack here[soundcloud.com], but i'd suggest you experience it within the game first.","March 3, 2014","true","4.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You can make 4 coexistant clones of yourself, and have the ability to swap between the one that you control. These clones help you throughout the game's many different puzzles and makes it a fun and unique experience.\n\nThe game doesn't look like much from the store page, and I was actually having a difficult time deciding on whether the game was worth playing or not. But let me tell you, I was SO incredibly glad that I did.\n\nGet lost (pun intended) in the beautifully vast Space Station Theseus. The storyline of The Swapper will have you addicted, trying to figure out just what happened to Theseus, who you are, and why the heck the rocks can talk. Limbo fans out there will find a few similarities with certain puzzles in The Swapper, which actually helped me to solve puzzles much easier.\n\nThere are two different ways in which The Swapper can end. Unfortunately, you cannot finish it one way, reload the save and finish it the other way. That's the only downside of The Swapper but I still give it a 10/10. As for the ending, choose the option you feel most strongest with.\n\nEverything about the game is brilliant, which is why I would give it a solid 10 and recommend that everybody who likes a puzzle/platformer game give it a go.\n\nKeep note though, if you're after achievements, do them before you finish the game, that's the easiest way to get them.\n\nI feel I have rattled on too much, but everythin I said applies. You will love this game :)\n\nTL;DR\n\nThe Swapper is fun, mysterious and mind boggling.\nHave fun creating clones of yourself and swapping between the one you control in order to solve tricky puzzles.\nIf you liked Limbo, you will love The Swapper just as much.","March 20, 2014","true","7.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

My friend knows me fairly well, so it wasn't that I didn't think I would like it, but rather, it felt like an expensive game for what it sold itself as. A standard puzzle-platformer with a unique art style. Awesome.\n\nBut really, the game was much more. The craftsmanship and love are in the details of the atmosphere, from the minute textures on the models, to creepy sound design, to integration of the plot into the mechanics (discovering what The Swapper is).\n\nOverall, I would justify a full-price purchase in support of the studio and wanting to see more games like this, though for most people the pure hours logged into this game may not justify the price at anything more than $5. As a mirror to the game itself, a lot is going to depend on your knowledge of "self" in whether this game is going to be a good purchase.","November 21, 2014","true","10.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

As a whole, I really enjoyed playing this game. The story was quite engaging and interesting.\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory:  The first thing that happens when you load The Swapper is you type out your name. The reason I say that is because I was never directly referred too throughout the game, it was mostly phrases like “hey you, guy who’s doing all these puzzles, go do this for me, because I’m lazy…but I am a girl and have a British accent so naturally you’ll forgive me.”\nAs you progress through the game you can get more detailed by reading through various logs left throughout the game, however as soon as my screen filled with text I said out loud “too many words!” and skipped and left it. (I sometimes wonder if that’s what people think when they see my reviews…)\n\nGame Play: I’m tempted to compare this game to portal, although instead of thinking with portals you’re thinking with clones. So maybe Naruto meets Portal? You need to shadow clone jutsu yourself through different gravity, various colored lights, and on top of pressure plates to solve the puzzles.\n\nAchievements: The only achievements for this game were hidden information logs that you need to go searching for. It was nice to play a game that didn’t have me do the same type of achievement the whole game. (I.e. finish the game, kill X amount of things, beat the game perfectly, beat hard mode, and then unlock all the special biscuits.)\n\nPrice: The Swapper’s standard price is $14.99, I played only 3 hours of the game and beat it. I did need help on three or four puzzles, however even if I just stared at the screen for a few extra hours helplessly lost trying to solve a puzzle, I still wouldn’t have been able to put in more than 10 hours for this game.\nI ended up purchasing this game in a humble bundle, (or maybe it was 90% off in a Christmas/summer sale, I can’t remember to be honest) while the game play is enjoyable and the controls are solid, the price is much higher then I’d be willing to purchase at full price.\n\nConclusion: The story was good, the game play was dynamic and interesting, the achievements were refreshing, but the price was $5.00 too high, I think this game does deserve a play through, if you enjoy puzzle games to any degree I recommend this game.","May 15, 2014","true","4.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TrottoirManagerNL/recommended/231160/","TrottoirManagerNL","Harry 2K16","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TrottoirManagerNL/","177 products in account","The Swapper is a side-scrolling puzzle platformer in which you solve puzzles by making clones of yourself. The game has you stranded on a spacestation. Within the game there are many rooms to explore, collecting orbs as you do so. These orbs help you get further in the game. Not that original but it works.\n\nTo collect the orbs you have to swap to the clone that is going to be in contact with the orbs. All the clones follow the same movement commands as the main clone. The puzzles mostly consist of rooms where there are special lights where you are unable to spawn a clone, swap to a clone or both. This may sound like a small thing, but the developers really thought about the many ways to use this.\n\nFrom my experience with the puzzles, some are done in the first try others can take a while.\nOften you will find out you just had to do one small trick to progress. The puzzle difficulty gets harder as you go, sometimes with large steps of difficulty. The last levels were really hard (But that could be down to me having a break from the game for a while).\n\nThe atmosphere of the game is really well done with the level design, story and sound design all contributing. What made the level design nice was that the whole world was made by using clay and other real objects as background. The world had a nice metroid feel, because you could explore many parts of the world. The only sad thing that later in the game it more felt like going from puzzle room through puzzle room. Happily enough you don't have to solve the puzzles in chronological order even though you still have to finish them all to go to the next area. The only complaint I can give is that some rooms looked the same, due to the dark look. But I guess that also does help with the lost spacestation feel.\n\nThe story is mostly told through cutscenes and optional reading messages. What is nice about the story is that it asks philosophical questions to make you think. One thing that can be annoying is that there are rocks in the game that when you pass them, your screen gets blurry and text will pop up. This is okay the first time, but becomes annoying after a while, especially if you have to pass by the same rock several times.  Another thing I found annoying was that some cutscenes aren't skippable so you have to watch them again should you die.\n\nThe game took me around 8 hours to complete and the last critical thing I have to say is that there is not much replay value once completed. There are multiple endings, but no reason to play the game all over again except if you wish to. You may be better off just watching the other ending on youtube. The achievements are pretty unfair in the game. I collected them in my first playthrough using a guide and I often thought 'How could anybody find this!?'\n\nThere are maybe parts that I am critical about, but they don't hold up in the end with the total experience you get.","February 22","true","8.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Don't judge me.\n\nThe Swapper is a 2-D puzzle game, one of those games where you advance from room to room and try to solve a puzzle, from easy ones, to absolutely head shattering ones. Kinda like Limbo, but a bit more complex and less about lightning reflexes, IMO.\n\nBut the sense of isolation, the atmosphere, the plot, and all in all, the gameplay of this game is just absolutely mind blowing. It's quite challenging, too, the visuals are gorgeous and there's lots to explore if you want to find the secret achievements, too. If you love puzzle games, this is a MUST buy.

As a game that crystallised into my inventory at random - no doubt due to a bundle - I went in blind, not having the faintest clue as to what it was. The name sounded intriguing, and that's about all the research that was done before hitting the install button.\n\nWhat followed was an interesting and eerie landscape where you find yourself launched from a spaceship into a barren world, with no means to defend yourself. In this sense, it is very similar to Limbo, but as you progress it becomes more of a Metroid environment than anything else, sans hostile lifeforms.\nNot that it will make you feel safe, however.\n\nAs you go through the barren planet and the spaceship, meeting with a fellow colonist who must surely have gone mad, and you encounter the only other sentience willing to talk to you, you're in for a trip. You'll find yourself creating clones high above ground level, transferring your conscience to them, and repeating this until you have reached the ungodly height an exit is stationed at, hearing the dull cracks of your lifeless brethren smack into the steel floors below.\n\nHell, even the first puzzle starts with you essentially killing yourself to escape.\n\nMake no mistake, this is a very fun game, and I might read into it far more than is needed, but there's something in the delivery, the atmosphere reminiscent of Dark Souls, ICO, Metroid and the upcoming Ghost Song, that make for a feeling of utter sadness every time you complete a puzzle and can carry on in the story. It feels like a loss of humanity as you shed coil after mortal coil in the pursuit of answers.\n\nAnswers as to what happened to the spaceship and its colonists. Answers as to what it was that murdered everyone. Answers as to where this technology came from.\nAnd knowing it all along.","September 27, 2014","true","5.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

From the opening scene it never discloses more than it wants to, instead forcing you to largely draw your own conclusions as to what transpires. It's an intelligent and brilliantly executed sci-fi narrative that doesn't bombard you with exposition, or easy explanations, culminating in an ending that left me completely stunned. This is a game that wants to make you think, asking questions of morality and withholding the answers, which in the end are entirely yours to decide.\n\nGameplay is just as smart as the story, and does so without a needlessly large amount of devices or mechanics. The Swapper refers to a device that allows you to create mindless copies of yourself to which you can then transfer, or swap, your consciousness to. With this single tool developer Facepalm Games crafts a relentlessly clever series of puzzles, with solutions that are never unfair or obtuse but at the same time demand meticulous thought and execution.\n\nI was continually impressed by how ingenious the puzzles were, leaving me scratching my head only to discover the answer had been staring me in the face. Like Portal the solutions are almost always much harder to come to than actually pulling them off, which is something so few games seem to understand and makes The Swapper that much more notable.\n\nEvery aspect of the arresting presentation works to construct a deliberately isolated and atmospheric experience. Thick shadows drape over the environment, with subdued lighting illuminating the stunning, hand molded character models only so much as to show the way forward. Sound effects as well as the soundtrack are used only when necessary, ensuring you are never unintentionally pulled out of the incredibly engrossing world, but only drawn deeper in.\n\nRight from the start though the four hours it took me to complete it, I couldn't put The Swapper down! It combines an ingenious gameplay mechanic with an enthralling, thought provoking narrative more effectively than we often ever see, and does so without confusing the player or pandering to the lowest common denominator. It's one of the best puzzle platformers I've ever played, easily a top contender for my personal 2013 GOTY, and a must play for any fan of science-fiction and puzzle games in general.","November 2, 2013","true","4.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tortugueta/recommended/231160/","tortugueta","Tortugueta","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tortugueta/","154 products in account","Let's start by saying that this is a puzzle game, if you didn't know.\n\nWith that out of the way, if a puzzle game is what you're looking for, I recommend this game wholeheartedly. There are two components in this game: the puzzles and the story that drives you to solve them. Or, if you prefer, the story and the puzzles you have to solve in order to progress in the story. Either way, both story and puzzles hold up their end of the bargain.\n\nThe story (by Tom Jubert, who was also behind the story in FTL) puts you in a derelict space station with some sentient rocks, a lunatic, dead crew and a gun that allows you to create clones of yourself and transfer your mind onto them if so you choose. The game explores the difficult subject of identity, the ethics of cloning, and what the hell is going on when you transfer your consciousness to one of your clones (John Perry being transfered to his new body in Old Man's War, anybody?). In order to progress in the story you need to hack into some consoles and you'll have to fetch some cryptographic orbs in order to do it. And that's where the puzzles come in.\n\nIn order to reach the orbs, you need to carry out a number of steps that involve creating clones in specific places in the room and transfer control to them (only the clone you control can get the orbs). This is complicated by regions in space with blue, red and purple light. You cannot create clones in regions with blue light; you cannot transfer control to clones when there's a region with red light between you and the clone; and you can do neither when there's purple light (blue and red at the same time). Moreover, for every step you take, the clones take it too (they mimic your movements). You have to use your clones to activate platforms that switch off lights or open hatches. Later in the game, a new mechanic is included to introduce a bit more variety and complication to the puzzles, and it consists in switches that change the gravity of the room from downwards to upwards and the other way around.\n\nI have found the puzzles to be very clever and very satisfying. This is the best I've seen since Braid. I have not found them to be excruciatingly difficult, which is good for me. You are not required to have an outstanding mental performance. We are not talking about being able to plot in your head 100 steps ahead. You just have to "see" it. Once you get it, the sequence takes only a handful of steps. I only got seriously stuck in four of the puzzles, and I just solved them by going to sleep. The next day, with a clear head and a different perspective, they all went down in a few minutes. All in all it took me six and a half hours to complete, and I'm dumb as ♥♥♥♥ for these things.\n\nOther than that, I loved the atmosphere. The art and the accompanying music really set the mood perfectly.\n\nIn short: if you are into puzzle games, this is a must in my opinion. And even if you are not a fan of the genre but want some food for thought every now and then (that is my case actually), I think this is the one you should get next. Unless you have not played Braid. In that case go play Braid NOW and then come back to this one.","January 6, 2015","true","6.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Clearly inspired by space odyssey classic films such as Moon or Solaris, The Swapper puts you in the role of a stranded spaceman seeking a way out of a space station that is undeniably doomed, but bumping into different stories, messages and characters on the way out, and giving you access to the swapper, a weapon designed to create up to four different clones of yourself and allowing you to swap between them. Once that becomes a regular thing, the game pushes ideas such as what happens to the clones that you leave behind or is swapping souls really a reality, planting them in your head so you can start and ask your own questions about mortality and existence and go deeper with the story it wants to tell based on what you are seeking after processing those things through your head on your own. Even with all the messages left behind and the information you get from other survivors or the mysterious rocks, in the end you will still have unanswered questions, but that is part of the mystery, something that might instantly make a sequel something worth looking into in the future. There is no restriction on where to go and what to do, as each puzzle area solved will reward you with a number of orbs that you will later use to perform a certain action and open up a new area, but the order in which you obtain those orbs and where you want to go next is entirely up to you. On the other hand, exploring other areas of the game wishing that you could uncover more things can leave you disappointed as even with all the movement liberty, the game follows a linear pattern and your only concern is getting the amount of orbs shown about the console in order to make your way to the next area and progress the story, and most areas which are not part of a puzzle portion lack the secondary events to make them worth exploring.\nRating: 9\n\nGameplay\nWhat makes The Swapper a unique game to play is the weapon that gives the game's title, allowing you to create up to four different clones of yourself, reproducing all your movements and allowing you to swap between them. Standing in your way are three different light beams, starting with the red beam that allows you to create clones inside it, but blocks the ability to swap to other clones if the swapper's trajectory goes through that beam, the blue beam that acts exactly the opposite and the purple beam that has both of the downsides. Combining the use of those beams with typical platforming elements such as gaps between platforms or switches results in unique puzzles that feel refreshing, but at the same time intuitive, making practice and trying out different approaches the key to succeeding. Even though you will mostly use your abilities inside the puzzle sections which are always marked on your map, making your way from one chamber to the next one is a challenge all by itself, as you will often have obstacles in your way or be forced to use the reverse gravity portal to reach the other end of the room. The best thing about the Swapper's gameplay however, is that it never feels old or repetitive as it constantly introduces new elements and making puzzles more challenging, but putting the knowledge your earn throughout the game to good use, they still feel clever and intuitive. As refreshing as the puzzles are, there are some concepts such as the zero gravity sections that feel left behind, as there are no puzzles utilizing that concept and the only portion of the game where the idea was used was when you had to move to the other end of the station in order to advance the game. Messages are also an important part of what The Swapper wants to achieve as they will detail the plot further as well as provide hints to help you complete puzzles easier and use the game's mechanics in a better way.\nRating: 8.5\n\nGraphics\nThis game is merely beautiful, and even though the entire story takes place in and around a space station, the environment is crafted in such a way to make each chamber feel unique and a significant part of the same set of rooms. The design feels monotone, but in this case that only contributes to the overall feeling of being stranded in space, desperately looking for the way out, only to find yourself in another chamber that looks different and at the same time astonishingly beautiful, but putting your skills to the test once more.\nRating: 9.5\n\nAudio\nAs good as it looks, The Swapper knows exactly the way it wants to make you feel by adding thrilling tunes in the background and changing the tone whenever something significant happens. Apart from the few characters that you will encounter during your journey there is little dialogue, but you will find console messages left behind wherever you go and rocks that will leave you messages that go deeper into the story, but unfortunately those are not voiced over, which is disappointing considering the bigger impact a godly rock leaving you messages could have on the lonely ambient.\nRating: 8.5\n\nExtras\nIt takes around 6 hours to get through the game's campaign, maybe another extra hour if some puzzles give you a hard time, and even though the ending is more than worth the journey, there is nothing else waiting for you afterwards. There is an alternate ending however, which can only be seen if you replay the entire campaign and take a different choice at the end, but considering the fact that you already know how to solve each puzzle, you'll probably question yourself if a second playthrough is really worth it when you can just look for the alternate ending online.\nRating: 6\n\nVerdict\nThe Swapper is truly one of a kind experience, and while it comes with its few flaws and ideas not reaching the peek they could have, for the price tag it comes with, it is more than worth the purchase, especially if you're into platformers and looking for something fresh to bring you back into the game.\nRating Overall: 8.3\n\nCheck out the full review and a lot more about The Swapper at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=266[/h1]","July 6, 2014","true","6.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The themes of the story are fascinating and complement the gameplay nicely.\n\nThe only thing about this game I consider a flaw is the inclusion of secret rooms that are extremely difficult to find. Each one gives you an achievement and a bit of backstory, but unless you use a guide you'll probably never find them.

Boy did I change my mind quick. This game was an absolute delight, with a thought-provoking story and deep message. This game does a great job of putting you in a lonely and desolate spaceship, and the atmosphere is incredible. The puzzles are classic for a puzzle genre, with switches and different coloured lights which don't exactly turn the puzzle genre on its head or introduce anything new. That aside, the puzzles are an absolute joy and are very satisfactory. My only real issue with this game is that the achievements require you to find hidden rooms with no clues or allusions to where they might be. In a massive ship like this, they can be a pain to find. So if you are an achievement hunter, have a guide on hand.\n\nPros:\n+ Deep and thought-provoking theme\n+ Great atmosphere\n+ Satisfactory puzzles\n\nCons:\n-Frustrating achievements that are impossible to find without a guide.\n\nOverall, this game is the best I have played in recent years.

Difficult, but logical. YOU WILL NEVER NEED A WALKTHROUGH. Each new puzzle is based off previous knowledge, no sudden leaps in difficulty that cause you to get stuck.\n\nThe story is confusing, but has a very satisfying ending. The themes of the story are fascinating and complement the gameplay nicely.\n\nThe only thing about this game I consider a flaw is the inclusion of secret rooms that are extremely difficult to find. Each one gives you an achievement and a bit of backstory, but unless you use a guide you'll probably never find them. I think it's a shame that an otherwise cohesive, beautifully made game included such an obvious trick to try and make the game seem deeper or keep people playing. It's completely unnecessary.\n\nOtherwise though, everything about this game is a fantastic experience.

I just finished the Steam indie game 'The Swapper'. Amazing. Deep. Thought-provoking. Questions of nouemenal and phenomenal basis for knowledge, mortality, consciousness and more form the basis of the deep and 'twisty' (???) story of this game. Clearly very Platonic, Neitzschean, Kantian influenced. The 'end' was 'sufficient' and playing through the game itself was the most rewarding part. The atmosphere and aesthetic reminds me of a mix of 'Alien' and 'Dead Space' and the visuals are absolutely gorgeous (iirc, they were all hand-crafted with clay or something).\n\nIt's a 'pure' puzzle-platformer (no combat) that's really, really fun and addictive and at times *absolutely brain-busting*. Loading times are literally non-existant. Gameplay involves your character finding a device that can create mindless 'clones' of yourself that move exactly as you move. You can transfer your 'consciousness' / 'will' to any of them, given that you have a direct line of sight. Sometimes your previous 'selves' must be sacrificed in order to use the environment and this device to accomplish puzzles and progress in the game. Very interesting and innovative gameplay mechanics, here.\n\nDefinitely recommend! 9/10, would bang.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AidyRHYg74c","November 29, 2013","true","7.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You have a Swapper that can create a maximum of 4 clones which copy your every move, and allows you to 'swap' with them by shooting them.\nIn your way stand two lights which block clone placement or swapping rays, and at times are found combined. Adding in hold-buttons that switch some of these lights or a blocking stone slide, we also have a gravity mechanic that uses gravity 'pads' to change your vertical gravity and the gravity of your consequently spawned clones.\nYou can easily imagine the complexity of these one-room puzzles, and for the most part it's to this kind of complexity that the puzzles stick to.\n\nThese puzzles generally do not block your way, but reward you with these 'orbs' where the occasional gate will require you to possess a minimum amount. Gameplay wise, that's all there is to it, and your only enemy is gravity itself, as you don't require too much height to fall fatally.\n\nTo pass these puzzles, thinking a little outside the box is sufficient, but you don't need to go drastically far. No need to suddenly figure out that your Swapper is an intergalactic drill that explores other dimensions while the Watchers would happen to be you from the Future...\nA little thinking beyond the obvious first impression, maybe the rare few feats of speedy thinking (the button to place clones slows time down when held) but in general it's all about figuring out the right order to do things. Trial and Error has helped me through most of the puzzles.\n\nStorywise... It's hard to say anything without spoiling a whole bunch.\nNot including the rare few 'cutscenes' from the same side-scrolling perspective, there are three main sources of story in this game. You have Data Terminals which provide some context on the 'missing' crew's experience before and during the main events of the story in shape of reports and written short conversations (presumably 'chats') ; the 'Watchers' in shape of strange boulders that distort your screen and show a few short words ; and speech of the rare occasional NPC walking by at a close but for-now unreachable location.\n\nAll in all, this was a 5-hour trip and has brought up some interesting questions around the identity of 'self' or what we call the 'soul'. Whether it actually answers these... not so much.\nAn interesting experience, perhaps best purchased at a slightly cheaper price or, like myself, in a Humble Indie Bundle.","February 24, 2014","true","5.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Aside from that, the game has very interesting puzzles: they are somehow straightforward, but not always easy to solve. I recommend it for philosophy and original puzzle lovers. Although it is a platformer, almost no “jumping & running” skills are necessary to play, for which I’m very thankful. It is a delightful experience from the beginning to the end.

Storyline is OK, graphics are nice and controls are very good. Mechanics of cloning may resemble Cloning Clyde but works in a different way:\n\n- Clones are not created beside you, instead you aim your one-of-a-kind gun and "shoot" to create them on the place you want (must have line of sight);\n\n- Number of clones is always limited to 4 (you need to delete clones to be able to create other clones on other places);\n\n- All clones mimick your moves, so you control everybody at the same time (some puzzles are based on this);\n\n- If a clone dies, there's no problem, but if you die, you'll return to the last checkpoint;\n\n- You can "shoot" at a clone to "transfer you soul" to that clone, so that the body you were becomes a clone and the clone you shot becomes you;\n\n- Time slows down when you're aiming to create a new clone, which is very useful. If you're falling from a high place to certain death, you can slow down time, create a new clone on the ground and transfer your soul to it before you hit the ground thus avoiding death, or you can "climb" through the air by creating clones above in the air, transfering your soul to it and quickly creating another clone even higher, soul tranfering again, repeat);\n\n- There are some plates that invert gravity only for those who stepped on it, so that you'll sometimes have clones walking on the ground and others on the roof at the same time (again, some puzzles demand this);\n\nThe game may be a bit short, but mostly enjoyable. Two possible endings (decided on the last scene), so save often to see both without need to play all over again.\n\nRecommended.","March 18, 2014","true","4.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The puzzles are unique, the game has challenge and keeps your interest.  The graphics and environment set well for the games atomosphere.   I'm enjoying this game immensly, it's different, it's intriguing and it keeps your mind thinking on how to solve puzzles.   I like how it uses color and beams to determine what functions your character can use.    The type of beams determine what you can and cannot do if your character crosses them.   You can create duplicates of yourself as part of the puzzle solving process and it's required.    The game leads you into the abilities of your character so it doesn't seem as if "poof" you can do these neat abilities it was a gradual process of instruduction being able to create mujltiple entities of yourself and swap with them to solve a puzzle.   I didn't find any bugs either.    If your looking for constant action packed excitement don't look here this one is for those who enjoy a unique twist to puzzle solving and does very well at it.   IF you like puzzle solving which is very rewarding look no futher this one will keep your attention for many hours and get you hooked and become a Swapper fan.  I look forward to seeing additional Swapper titles as this type of game can go really far and the story is great.     I hope the developer makes more I can't wait to see what they can do by expanding a very impressive concept.   There's nothing like it pick this gem up.\n\nDisclaimer:  Although it says 1 hour on record this appears to be incorrect.  Many hours have been played so this is somewhat confusing as the game time is wrong.   I have indeed played it for more than 3 hours and intend to do more until I reach the end.","December 30, 2013","true","1.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atebash/recommended/231160/","atebash","Atebash","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atebash/","1019 products in account","The Swapper is a rather simple puzzle platformer with an interesting gameplay: you are equipped with a unique weapon which allows you to create clones of yourself and swap with them. Confusing? I just may lack words to actually describe it correctly, but it really is a simple concept and will take you no more than 2 minutes to get used to what you need to do.\n\nThere's no one to kill in this game, there are no quick movements (mostly) so that kind of skill is far from needed. What you really need is a brain and some patience in order to complete this game. Mind you, it's not really a brain-killer as most puzzles are really easy to complete. Sometimes all you need is a two minute break to rest a bit and it will all come to you.\n\nAnyway, what's it about? You are an astronaut on a Space Station Theseus and there's been an accident. You are trying to escape as well as find out what actually happened there. In order to progress you need to open certain doors and each door requires you to own a certain number of orbs. Orbs can be collected by solving puzzles. To solve puzzles you need to create clones of yourself (and swap places with your own clones, as I said before). These clones will do exactly the same movements and actions as yourself and you will need to use them to open doors, step on certain spots etc.\n\nAs I said, the game is incredibly simple in its mechanics, but is challenging enough to keep you playing it for 5 or 6 hours until the very end. I really enjoyed the time spent on this and I managed to get stuck only once! And it was only because I didn't notice one floor tile (it was upside down and I guess I was just too tired). The real challenges come up at later stages as you get into rooms where you know exactly what you need to do - but you need to figure HOW to do it.\n\nOne real good feature are teleporters that will allow you to move quickly if you ever need to go back to some room (if you missed something or took a left turn and now you want to go right). I just love it when developers think about us players and our need to cut down the lost time :)\n\nThere are 10 achievements in the game as well and they are real pain in the ♥♥♥. Not because they are too hard to get or are luck based... No, it's because they require you to find 10 hidden rooms and to do that you would need to randomly clone and swap yourself into hidden walls and corridors. Most of the time such corridors are too well hidden and you'd do better if you ignore that part of the game completely. Unless you read a guide or watch YouTube videos to find out their locations.\n\nOverall, The Swapper is a beautiful and entertaining indie game that will leave you asking for more. As for the actual story that develops as you progress - I leave that to you. It's a bit confusing... and unimportant, to be honest. Enjoy it while it lasts.","April 14, 2014","true","10.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Good for one playthrough.\n\nMost people rave about the visuals assembled from digitized clay sculpture, but I found the amount of bloom and distortion effects applied to be mildly aggravating, like an almost unnoticed headache.\n\nReplayability is nil unless you're an achievement completionist. There's a binary moral choice at the end which requires an entire replay just to see the alternative. No thanks, I'll just watch a replay.\n\nthe novelty of the swapper mechanic with its challenging puzzles makes up for its faults. The voice acting is good. The story is decent; not as profound as I imagine the creators hoped, but not preachy or pretentious.

I’m about 11 hours into the game now and unlike some games I haven’t needed to scan the internet to find the answer to a puzzle; the game explains itself in a simple yet effective way. The computer systems in the game tell a story as well as a former astronaut who we hear in flashback I presume (I haven’t yet completed the game) finally when you pass some of the planets mined rocks they seem to send messages to you as well which brings in the Dead Space element to the game!\nBuy this game for your friends in the sale if you want to spend a little less but honestly you won’t regret it and you friends will thank you for it.\n\nThis is one of those games were you want a t-shirt and comic book series spin off.

The questions that are asked and "relatively" answered are: Who, what, when, why, and how? The Swapper is a story of very personal elements, which attempt to invoke self-thought and reflection. The game boasts a fantastic ambient soundtrack, gorgeous claymation visuals, and fluent mechanics. The puzzles you solve are made possible by cloning the player (the clones imitate the precise movement of the original), so careful movement and planning is required.\n\nIn the end The Swapper is a beautiful, artistic, and stellar creation and is absolutely a must have for any fan of the science fiction genre!","November 11, 2013","true","9.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/recommended/231160/","Brian_Colfxire","Brian C. (The Schmaltzy Cynic)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/","468 products in account","There are few games that ask the player to answer questions it raises, and even fewer that employ game-mechanics so focused on the narrative. The Swapper succeeds in the former category, but the latter feels not often thought out.\n\nDon't let what I've said turn you away. Sure, it's an artsy kind of platformer with a philosophical undertone, but the story is captivating to unravel for yourself and the gameplay is superb as well to make playing the game equally as challenging.\n\nWhat Makes It So Special?\nUnlike many artsy-smartsy platformers with almost zero mechanics, The Swapper will warrant you to play the game for its challenge as a puzzle game. It's undoubtly a game.\n\nIn the Swapper, you have the ability to create copies of yourself and to transfer your "soul" to another clone. The game will slow down and you can place your clones with your mouse or right-thumbstick. This comes into play when you have more quick-reaction puzzles.\n\nSounds simple, right? However, if you move one body it moves all of your clones with every movement. And if your clone dies or combines with yourself, you can make another clone.\n\nThe Swapper's sense of challenge comes from this limitation; you have to manage all your copies at once, which would otherwise make the basic idea boring.\n\nFor some puzzles with a large room/options, the puzzles can be daunting because of that added challenge. As a result, there always seems to be one--and only one--solution. If you were hoping for some versatility in your puzzles, then you probably won't like this game that much for its puzzles.\n\nThe game sticks with its gimmick throughout the whole game, and it adds new puzzles/obstacles to keep things interesting. Colored lights that can disable some of the Swapper's abilities, reverse gravity jump-pads, switches, boxes, All of which use your clones in some way. Sometimes not as obvious as you might think.\n\nYou do not need to collect everything in the game. You only need 100 orbs to beat the game. The rest of the rooms are for completionists, which will extend your playthrough for another few hours. But if you only care for the story, you can focus only on finding all the Watchers (althought numbers 20-something to 38 seem repeating dialogue of what you'll hear in the main-game.)\n\nThe gameplay itself will make the Swapper become more familiar to you as you experiment with its mechanics, and the story will work off your experimentation to question just what it is your are doing exactly.\n\nWho Am I?\n"The one called the Swapper -- it manipulates minds by some method that is not persuasion or argument. Is it a weapon?"\n\nThese scattered messages and seemingly random characters you encounter are how The Swapper presents its story. You'll be left with more questions than answers often, but you will get some concrete information to ground your answers. Instead of feeling like a cop-out for telling a story, the game knows when to give you information and when to keep the mystery at bay.\n\nThat said, you don't need to brush up on your Kiekargaard, Descartes or your ancient Greeks to understand the kind of questions this game raises. It touches on philosophical quandries as timeless as the concept of souls and the perception vs. the reality of your identity.\n\nThis method works within the game's narrative and mechanics, and as such they are asked in a more relatable/modern manner. Mostly through messages, conversations with a limited cast of characters and teleopathicconnections. As these are more interpretetitve ideas, the game focuses on raising the questions it wants you to ask of yourself, rather than straight-out giving an answer to everything.\n\nIf you are going to do a philosophical game, this approach is definitely what you want to go for. (let the player ask and find their own answers.) However, and what can happen as a result of the storytelling method, the decision you make at the very end can either go over your head or feel kind of shallow if you don't care to figure it out.\n\nThe other downside to this type of narrative is sometimes you'll raise questions that weren't meant to be asked.\n\nWhat is Gameplay-Narrative Dissonance?\nIf that sounds too wordy/convulted of a phrase, then let me rephrase it like this, "Why is that object/mechanic here? What does it do besides play a role in the game? Why would anyone design a space-station this way?"\n\nWhat breaks the immersion is this "gamey" feel about the game. In most cases, these are things I overlook because it's just a game. Sometimes, like in LISA or Undertale, the gamey-ness aspects are to subvert your expectations or to twist your perception of them.\n\nHowever, the Swapper does not do anything with its gamey qualities, which is asking for more questions from the player. Many of which I don't think are intended to be asked.\n\nFor example, "Why do the lights affect the Swapper? Why do they affect my copies (and why not me)?" On this ship and on the planet below are these multicolored lights that are so precisely place to hide these orbs that unlock doors/systems. "Why do these orbs power everything around here, and why are they put into these rooms like puzzles?" So you can get around the station/planet. "Wait, and you need the Swapper to get around this place, but they banned its usage. So how did everyone get around this place?"\n\nI realize this seems a rather pointless series of questions as most games don't care about how gamey they feel. However, if a game is trying to tie its mechanics so much into its story, and the story establishes some things about the usage of a mechanic, then these questions are going to be asked by the player and break the continuity of the story from the gameplay.\n\nThe reason I stress this flaw is because as much harm you hear/read about the Swapper being used, you never really feel like using it comes with consequences.\n\nFor example, there isn't a limit on how many times you can copy yourself nor any penalties. And despite the horror in the idea of the Swapper being misused, there's nothing said its effects cannot be undone. It's something the game assumes is a permanent choice, which affects how you interpret the ending.\n\nA Game Full of Questions, Void of Simple Answers\nYou might come away thinking this game is nothing but sophistry. Or you might come away thinking you understand the ramifications of the game, and the attrocity of the Swapper itself. Or you might understand and like things about the gameplay and narrative but find that both were not in a happy marriage with each other.\n\nIf you're interested in the mechanics or the story alone, buy the game on a sale.\n\nIf you're interested in both the narrative and story, buy it whenever you want.\n\nPerhaps when you've been on the other side will you have a clearer mind. Or find yourself in more of a mess than what you began with.

The puzzles primarily consist of making clones of your character (which jump and move in unison with you) and then “swapping” your current self with one of your clones.  While the story is a bit abstract, the puzzles are expertly crafted and strike the right balance of difficulty and creativity.\n\nIn the Swapper, you play an astronaut who is exploring a mostly-empty space station.  It is quickly revealed that the inhabitants of the station found a unique type of rock species which contains a shared conscience.  The rocks are seemingly benign, but as you solve puzzles and make progress deeper into the story, more is revealed on the nature of the rocks and of the researchers.  By the end, Swapper asks a lot of deep questions about conscience, the soul, and existence.  Some of it is genuinely intriguing and thought-provoking, but I would be lying if I said some of it didn’t go a bit over my head.\n\nOne thing is for certain: the Swapper absolutely oozes atmosphere.  The vastness and emptiness of the space station which you are exploring is really incredible; a top-notch music soundtrack and the claymation graphics certainly help.\n\nOf course, the puzzles themselves in the Swapper are truly the star of the game.  At the beginning of the game, puzzles are relatively straight-forward but are still interesting and creative.  By the end, more mechanics are introduced and there are some puzzles which I found quite difficult -- one in particular had me walk away for a bit and I literally thought of the solution while taking a shower.  Most importantly, all of the puzzles in the Swapper never feel like they are cheating you; the solution always feels on the tip of your fingers and, once you reach it, is always extremely satisfying.\n\nAnyone who hasn’t played the Swapper and loves puzzle games, especially along the lines of Portal, should absolutely play this game.  The story is interesting (if not a bit confusing), the puzzles are excellent, and it’s all accented with excellent music and graphics.  It’s a short experience, but definitely one worth the price of entry.","February 15, 2015","true","4.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I definitely am enjoying this game. The setting, the atmosphere, the sobering graphics....they are all top notch. The 2-D scrolling with lush backgrounds works quite well (this is much the same as Deadlight as far as the way in which the background is presented as something vibrant but untouchable).\nSo, the gameplay is pretty straight forward, but the difficulty definitely spikes after about an hour, and at the point I'm at now, some of the puzzles seem near impossible. This isnt a bad thing, and I know there is a solution for all of them, but they really get incredibly challenging in my opinion.\nSpeaking of gameplay, it's a simple affair. A and D to move around, W or space to jump, E to activate objects, S to hold movable objects. The mouse is used to adjust view, project and swap your clones. All your clones move together, and you can have a total of four out there at any time.\nThe puzzles themselves are mostly color oriented with pressure plates, deadfalls, jumps, etc...entering into the mix.\nThere are also a couple zero gravity sections where you have to adjust your gameplay a bit.\nAnyway, this is definitely a fun, intense game well worth trying out.\n\nNow, a couple SPOILERS....SPOILERS....SPOILERS\n\nWhen you are projecting your clone, the game slows down to a crawl. You can use this to help slow your falls and time your swaps while falling, which you will need to do. You can also use swapping to basically climb through the air.\n\nThe story has taken on a touch of sci-fi horror at the point I'm at. I've uncovered about 2/3 of the map so far, and I imagine the story will get a bit darker as it continues. There are weird, seemingl;y intelligent stones throughout the complex. They all have a thought stored in them. I am guessing that as people were experimenting with the swapping devices initially, their thoughts/memories were transfered to the stones, and possibly their bodies were possessed by the minds of the alien stones. This is strictly specualtion on my part right now though, but I thought it would be fun to see if I was correct or not.\n\nAchievements; These have nothing to do with gameplay, the story, or anything else. They are each linked to hidden messages found throughout the game. You cant see where they are and the means to get to them is never obvious (they are in blacked out sections that dont look like you can actually access). I havent actually found any, but I just watched a video on them and realized I missed 6 or 7 of them already.\n\n\nSPOILERS END HERE\n\nAll in all, TL:DR, but enjoy regardless.","September 1, 2013","true","3.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","2"

Everything about The Swapper is awesome.\n\nGRAPHICS: The Swapper could have easily contented itself with some cheap cartoon or 8-bit art style. Thankfully, The devs went all out in the graphics department, crafting detailed art assets out of clay to convey its world. The game is technically 2D, but uses adavanced Depth of Field and lighting effects to convincingly simulate environments, in a very atmospheric way. It's one of the best looking games I've ever seen, indie or otherwise.\n\nSOUND/MUSIC: The game also has solid sound design. Reverb is very well done and does wonders in terms of selling the atmosphere. Every sound is high quality and properly processed for where the sound occurs (in a hallway, in airlock, etc). The soundtrack is great as well: solemn tunes ranging from classical-ish piano pieces to atmospheric electronic tones.\n\nGAMEPLAY: Movement and mouse control are very polished, as is the Swapper mechanic. Basically, you can create up to four clones of yourself anywhere on-screen that is not blocked, and they mirror your movemnts. You can then swap to become any one of them with the device. The great depth of this mechanic is revealed as you progress through the game, introducing pressure pads, lights that block certain functions of the device, and much more. Solving puzzles rewards you with one or more "orbs" that allow you to activate consoles to progress. This is balanced so that you can skip some puzzles and still progress, though you have to complete all puzzles to reach the game's ending (you can use teleport devices to re-visit earlier puzzles). I had to consult a walkthrough twice towards the end of the game, but in general the puzzles were balanced, rewarding, and very well designed.\n\nSTORY: Pay close attention from the very beginning to the very end, and play in large chunks of time. You don't want to miss a single detail in The Swapper's incredible story. Without spoiling anything, the plot is directly linked to the core gameplay mechanics in a very unique way. I will never forget the ending.\n\nVERDICT: 9.5/10\nWould clone myself so I could recommend it more\nWould swap myself so I could experience it again","June 29, 2014","true","6.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But is it just another ♥♥♥♥♥♥ clone, or maybe something else? Let's find out.\n\nThe game is set on some kind of abandoned space station orbiting an unexplored planet, where our main character arrives at the beginning. We don't know who he is or why is he there. Soon we'll find the Swapper, a portal-gun-like device that will become our main tool throughout the game.\n\nIt has two functions: creating a clone of yourself at a certain location that will move exactly as you and swapping the control from yourself to the clone. You can have up to four clones plus the main character at the same time. With such a powerful tool, you would think no puzzle will resist you more than a few seconds. And here it comes the brilliance of the game designers: the puzzles ARE hard. The start being easy, but soon you will find yourself stuck for the first time.\n\nFortunately, the game offers the player some freedom on the order puzzles must be done (but eventually every one must be completed to end the game), so you don't desperately stand for hours trying the same puzzle. Also, it alternates these puzzles with more narrative sequences, letting you learn some of what happened here before your arrival. The story itself is quite interesting, following the path of speculative / philosophical science-fiction, and has a really decent ending.\n\nOn the art of the game, the graphics are nice and original, specially textures, through the character moves seem quite orthopedic and sometimes there is just too much blur on the screen. On the other hand, the soundrack is outstanding, ranging from ambient passages that get you into the isolation atmosphere of the game to beautiful and evocative piano melodies.\n\nIn conclusion, The Swapper is an awesome adventure and a very well done game in every aspect of its development. It is however a bit expensive for the 5/6 hours that last a basic gameplay. But hey, it is on sale quite often.","December 22, 2014","true","7.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Especially with all these indie developers vying to be the one to finally get games recognized as “art”. But as Facepalm Games seems to understand, art isn’t about the destination. It’s about what brought you there.\n\nThe Swapper does not lack for artistic content. All of the visuals are made from clay models and other real-world materials, given a fancy shader to make your unnamed spaceman’s flashlight bounce off their surfaces realistically. It’s beautiful in its simplicity and effectiveness, invoking a mood very reminiscent of the cult-classic 1972 sci-fi movie Silent Running.\n\nThe Mr. Spaceman you play, comes across a strange device that lets you create clones and swap between them. All the clones mimic your movements exactly. The first time you get so caught up in solving a puzzle that you forget which one was “you” (which you then accidentally kill), is a very memorable moment. If a clone dies, it’s no big deal. You just make another. But there’s only one of you. Right?\n\nThe puzzles get tricky, but frustration is offset due to the open-world nature of the space station. While you are gated somewhat, multiple puzzles are available to you at any time. Exploration leads to discovery, and clues about the strange sentient rocks everywhere in the station.","September 22, 2014","true","2.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With the overall theme of the game, it actually proves to be quite deep if you pay attention and take the time to think about it for a bit.\n\nAs mentioned before, the main puzzle mechanic of the game is to create clones of yourself which move simultaneously with you and which you have to place in the right spots to trigger switches and so on. Additionally, you can freely switch between all created clones and take control of them so they become the 'main character', which is especially useful with puzzles where you tend to die.\n\nDying is actually a large part of the puzzle experience as you will have to first figure out how the puzzle is supposed to work before you actually solve it and that will definitely produce some, uh, collateral damage. Luckily enough, only your main character can actually die, which will cause you to respawn in the room you're currently in.\n\nTo add a bit of challenge to it, there are red, blue and purple lights placed in the enviroments, which will prevent you from either creating clones or swapping between them - or both. Around halfway through the game, another puzzle mechanic is introduced where you have glowing platforms on the ground and/or ceiling, that will alter gravity and basically flip you upside-down (similar to VVVVVV), which adds another tad of challenge to the puzzles.\n\nPersonally, and despite the above mentioned challenge mechanics, I found the puzzles to be fairly simple and relatively easy for the most part. There definitely were some tough nuts among them, but unfortunately those were the exception to the rule.\n\nVisually, the game looks fairly cool and gets even cooler once you realize that all of what you see there 'is constructed using clay models and other everyday materials'. The lighting, depth of field and bloom also add a lot to the atmosphere of the enviroments, though I would've wished for a slightly brighter level design as some areas are literally pitch black.\n\nWith around 5 hours of playtime, The Swapper isn't overly long but feels just about right for the game. Unfortunately, it doesn't really offer any replay value unless you want to replay it for the sake of paying more attention to the story and dialogues.\n\nAs a PSA: If you plan to get the achievements in the game (which require you to find 10 hidden consoles), make sure to do it before you activate the final 124-Orb terminal, as this is a point of no return and you will have to replay the whole game again in case you missed any of the achievements.\n\nAll in all, The Swapper is a really impressive debut game of Finnish developer Facepalm Games and I'm definitely looking forward to see more quality games like this from them.","August 4, 2013","true","5.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has a deep plot line (though there are plot holes here or there), with a decision to eventually make.\n\nAlong the way, there are also some secret rooms you can find if you're skilled enough at platformers to know how to look for them. Also, make sure to read up on the controls before playing. This isn't a spoiler at all, but I'll put it in a spoiler tag just in case:  just hold down the 'make clone' button to slow down time. Seriously. Without this, the game is nearly unplayable, but it may not be clear that holding it down slows down time.\n\nAs an old fan of Oddworld, I absolutely love this game. The puzzles are challenging, but not impossible, and definitely give you that great 'ah-hah!' feeling when you solve one. As long as you're working the controls correctly, you don't need to be that quick on the keyboard, but you do need to be paying attention during the puzzles to align and time things correctly.\n\nThe content isn't graphic, though it may contain some slightly disturbing ideas to sensitive folk.

The main character wields a device that allows you to create clones and swap places with any of the clones, and you have to get to the next point using this swapper device. The levels are very well designed and ordered, so it was very entertaining throughout, and nowhere was it too difficult. Not only is gameplay outstanding, but the setting is also superb. the game takes place in a space station where nearly everyone has died due to an unknown psychological phenomenon. The game has a ominous and eerie tone that successfully binds you to the story and makes you want to find out what is happening as story reveals, and the ending gives you something to think about philosophically.

The game takes place in a beautifully realized science fiction setting; as you traverse an enormous yet desolate research station orbiting an alien world, you begin to piece together an understanding of the events which led it to such a state. However, with each bit of information about the past that you uncover, new questions about the present begin to appear.\n\nOverall, The Swapper is a game that accomplishes a lot without overstaying its welcome. It's short enough (roughly 3 - 6 hours) that despite puzzle mechanics that are fairly limited in scope, it rarely feels repetitive, and it leaves you satisfied but wanting more.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/icemouth/recommended/231160/","icemouth","HIIMETHANBRADBERRY","http://steamcommunity.com/id/icemouth/","1247 products in account","A really, really cool game. Swapper relies on one mechanic....swapping. Using the "Swapper", a gun which is capable of creating clones and swapping consciousness, you explore the ghostly, empty shell of a massive space station where something clearly went very wrong.\n\nUsing the Swapper you can create up to four clones at a time, all of which mimic any movement you make, and you can swap your consciousness (control) between them. You use these mechanics to solve a wide variety of puzzles in order to collect orbs which allow you to unlock further ways into the depths of the ship. The concept--while easy sounding--results in some very challenging puzzles with the introduction of different lights which either allow you to create a clone in it but prevent you swapping, or block you from creating clones but allow you to swap. They start off easy but steadily increase in difficulty and introduce different tactics before throwing you in the head scratchers.\n\nThe atmosphere of the game is amazing. From the main menu to the game itself, the design is beautiful and minimalistic (although also incredibly detailed) and is backed by an incredible musical score. The story is unique and presented through recorded logs which slowly allow you to piece together the backstory, as well as an in-game character, and the environment itself. No cutscenes or QTEs stalling the pace. The entire package is haunting and mysterious while being wrapped with solid, challenging gameplay. Worth a lot more than the price if you're a fan of puzzle/adventure/mystery games.","September 6, 2013","true","9.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And a sense of how it could well be our own.\n\nWhat would you do to survive?","June 28, 2014","true","6.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It offers a simple and straight-forward concept and utilises it to its full potential - create clones of yourself that copy your every move in order to solve puzzles. The puzzles vary between each other, and some introduce new things into the mix. For example not being able to create any clones within blue light, or not being able to swap between the clones within red light. In late stages the game also offers gimmicks with artificial gravity too, which adds a layer of complexity to the puzzles.\n\nMost of the game has you solve puzzles in order to collect orbs, and a certain number of these is required to get past checkpoints to another area. I really liked this semi-open feel of exploration that the game offered, and for most of it you didn't even have to solve every single puzzle in order to make progress. You could afford to skip some. However, the very last console checkpoint requires that you solve every single puzzle that's left. Most of the puzzles were really intuitive and felt rewarding when you solved them, but I wasn't a fan of a few near the end. Three of the puzzles took me so many attempts that I eventually had to consult a walkthrough. I think that it would've been better if the final checkpoint didn't require every single puzzle to be solved.\n\nThroughout exploring the ship and solving puzzles, there are many logs and interactable computer terminals that shed light on the creepy backstory behind this device that you're using to create clones. In general the story was in the background, but its concepts would leave you thinking of what's morally right, especially with the way it concluded with an interesting choice of two alternate endings.\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed the game and thought it was pulled off really well. Only the last few puzzles near the end frustrated me. Would certainly recommend it for all fans of puzzle games.","July 17, 2015","true","6.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The player is equipped with a device called the swapper, hence the game name. The device allows a person to create up to four clones at a time and can swap to control any of them. The puzzle revolves around these two core elements as you gain no additional abilities when the game progesses. However, new puzzle elements are added to keep you scratching heads. There is no narrator to tells you what the story is about. All that you have is gathered from space rocks and memory logs that tells you about the past. Throughout the game, it constantly portrays the questions about life and whether you are ready to sacrifice your humanity for survival. In the end, I  swapped myself with another person to survive.\n\nThe negative part about this game is the length which is considerably short, depending on how good you are with puzzle games. The hidden rooms which nets you steam achievement are literally impossible to find unless referring to a guide. It gives you no clue on how to get there.

As art, it's lovely. As a story, it's compelling.\n\nThe number of puzzles isn't huge - maybe a few dozen in total - but there's lots of exploring to be done, and the game will likely take several hours to work through. Each requires progressively more thought and planning - there's certainly nothing "casual" about these puzzles - and the last handful are particularly challenging. I caved and looked for help with a couple, though I wish I hadn't.\n\nIt seems reasonable to compare the puzzle elements of this game with Portal - there are only a few game mechanics, and the game pushes you to fully explore those mechanics rather than throwing new ones at you. If anything, The Swapper's puzzles are more polished - they don't use "filler" puzzles with the same solution, and they always present a mental challenge, never falling back on split-second timing or mid-air object catches.\n\nThe art and audio suit the game perfectly. The engine works wonders with the clay objects and animation, and it's immersive. I completely forgot to admire the quality of the clay modelling because I was so absorbed in the world, story and puzzles.\n\nThe science fiction elements of the story are well thought out, and are used to great effect to create a clever story with a satisfying finale. While the plot deals with philosophy, morality and mortality, it stops short of pushing a particular world view, meaning it should be enjoyable to anyone who appreciates science fiction.","January 20, 2014","true","8.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It plays like Limbo, what that entails is the player character is floaty, the controls are rudimentary and the driving force is ingame/inengine cutscenes with a certain vagueness to them.  However it isn't linear like Limbo and has a Metroid Prime structure to it, with datalogs/internal monologues.  So that should give you an idea of how it will play and what you will experience.\n\nWith that said, the puzzles are simple at first, but get pretty devilish as the game progresses.  The music is fantastic.  The whole game feels like a visionary Sci-Fi classic, presenting you with the questions and some thoughts on them, but never supplying anything close to a concrete answer.  I don't know how to explain the graphics, but looks like a 3-D/claymation effect without really being either, in my opinion, which isn't a bad thing since I like the look.\n\nI randomly started playing it one afternoon and could not stop.

Even more impressive is the game's atmosphere, which is both solitary and very contemplative. Basically, this game made me want to go read some good sci-fi.\n\nThe puzzles are varied and most are challenging without being frustrating, and nothing requires split-second timing. My only complaint with The Swapper is that to complete it, you have to solve every single puzzle in the game. Until the end, the game's obstacles (unlocked using orbs you solve puzzles to collect) can be passed by solving most, but not all available puzzles. This lets you skip a handful that I found too difficult, even after trying over several days. The very end, however, requires you to go back and solve EVERYTHING. This was frustrating.\n\nAlso, if you're a lunatic for achievements, this game hides all its achievements and a fair amount of back story on ten hidden terminals. These aren't like Bioshock Inifinite audio-log "hidden", these basically require you to glitch through seemingly solid walls where there is no indication of a collectible. If it was just achievements hidden this way it would be stupid but easily ignored; the fact that there is additional story and flavor hidden so ridiculously deep is aggravating.\n\nMy quibbles with it are minor, though.

Which is good for most people who has little time in their hands, and just wants to burn a few away.\n5. The puzzles are simple, yet complicated in a way in correlation with the game mechanic. It will make you think for a lengthy time. There were only 2 puzzles that I was stuck for a long time, but it may be so more or less to other people. These are not creativeness-dependent puzzles. These are puzzles which you need to be very observant to get through.\n4. The music is soothing, wonderful, creepy, and scary all at the same time. It blends with the whole environment of the game.\n5. The aesthetics and graphical fidelity are gorgeous. If I recall, they made most of everthing out of claymation or just clay.\n6. The plot is unique as with most indies are. But this is rather a sad one.\n10. You only have two(2) choices. Either you live your independence, or join in the great chain.\n\nThe story is rather obscure for most people who played the game.

You are controlling a clone.\n\nIf you finished the game, and want to know more about what the hell happened.

The Swapper immediately assumes you are an intelligent person and presents your mind a smorgasbord to feast upon.\n\nAt it's core The Swapper is a 2D puzzle platformer that uses a simple yet powerful gimmick to challenge the problem solving part of your brain.  You get a device called 'the swapper' and it allows you to create up to 4 clones of yourself which mimic each move you do.  You then can swap direct control between any which one in firing range and then chip away at some masterfully designed puzzles which remain challenging but never frustrating.\n\nThe narrative of the game is best left for discovery, but I will say it will please anyone with an affinity for sci-fi short stories.  The questions that askes you will have you long pondering its themes long after you take a break or finish the game.  And its themes are multifaceted and varied and I can easily see myself diving in for seconds and thirds.\n\nVisually The Swapper is outstanding.  The vast majority of the visuals were crafted from clay and household items and work to give it a real organic feel.  Paired with a ambient sountrack that floats between giving sensations of isolation to painting portraits of beauty, they work in tandem to create an atmosphere that completely captivates you in the game world.\n\nIf you happen to be one of those psudo-intellectuals such as myself and enjoy chewing deep and philosphical questions and happen to love games as well, The Swapper is an experience well worth your time and money.  I can't speak highly enough of it.","February 21, 2014","true","5.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atruejedi/recommended/231160/","atruejedi","Jamison","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atruejedi/","364 products in account","The Swapper is a science fiction platformer puzzle game that successfully balances difficulty with enjoyment. You, playing as the unknown, silent protagonist, explore a space station while using a "gun" infused with technology capable of materializing clones on the spot and transferring your consciousness into said clones' bodies at will. Think of digistructing from Borderlands plus mind-control; that about sums up the mechanics. There are no enemies to encounter and the game allows plenty of time to think through the puzzles, which really do ramp up in difficulty as more variables are added and the game progresses. I'll admit I looked up directions on how to solve a puzzle or two in the beginning of the game when I was familiarizing myself with the mechanics, but I was ashamed of myself and grinded through the rest on my own, racking my brain to divine the correct solution... but when I finally DID solve a tricky puzzle? HUZZAH! Self-worth! Fist-in-the-air "YEAH! FINALLY!" celebrations! After feeling so brainless and idiotic struggling with a puzzle, completing it was extremely rewarding.\n\nThe plot is intriguing and, without spoiling anything, makes the player ask thoughtful existential and philosophical questions about oneself, living, dying, and what it is to "be." Throughout the game you sacrifice innumerable clones; a soaring mountain of these conjured meat sacks were killed during the time I had my finger on the trigger of the Swapper. They mostly died by smashing into the ground from extreme heights... hopefully the fall killed them instantly and painlessly. After all, I was responsible for their deaths; they died during my attempt to escape the space station. I killed these poor souls. Hundreds of them. At least! But are they souls? Are they of worth? Are they YOU? Was it murder or... suicide? Or neither? Both? Am I still me if I'm living in a new body every few seconds? If the body didn't resemble mine, would I still be me? Can being transfer between mediums? Does a soul exist independently from the body? Does consciousness transcend the material? These questions are particularly salient during the final scene, which forces the player to make a gritty and difficult choice. This is real science fiction and demonstrates that video games can unquestionably qualify as art.\n\nI thought this would be a good game with which to use my gamepad, but boy, was I wrong. I do NOT recommend using a gamepad for The Swapper. Maybe it's just a personal lack of dexterity when using a gamepad (compared to a mouse and keyboard), but using the D-Pad and thumb sticks just didn't give me the precision and speed necessary to complete even the moderately difficult puzzles. The game took me about five hours to complete, and that included finding all of the terminals and messages. I did NOT find the hidden rooms related to the achievements, nor did I even attempt to do so. Even without them, I was extremely satisfied with the length of the game and the story presented. The Swapper was a joy to play and left me very satisfied... yet unsettled. I'm still not sure about the choice I made at the end of the game... and I fear I might never be. Was it the right decision? Was there ANY right decision? Maybe you're just damned if you do and damned if you don't. Life is precious, but if we allow it to continue perpetually, does it remain so?","December 15, 2014","true","5.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Moist Panties","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CPTMOISTPANTIES/","261 products in account","An indie title that is, shockingly, good. I'm not being facetious, I do believe that the majority of indie titles coast by easily on gimmicks such as 8-bit graphics or meme spouting that earn them undeserved praise among the gaming public. Some indie titles try way too hard to come off as intellectually stimulating and are heralded by people who are accustomed to triple A titles that stopped trying long ago. Being accustomed to ♥♥♥♥, they uphold anything that is remotely different as a godsend without looking at it individually and critically, falling prey to the hype and hysteria that comes with a community desperate to stick it to big name publishers by praising tiny developers without criticizing as readily due to a crowd that is too easily swayed by chiptune soundtracks or 8-bit graphics and faux-intellectualism.\n\nSome of that is present here, sadly. The plot starts off by throwing you into the thick of things, giving you logs to read without any context or attempt to ease you more readily into the game's story. Soon enough (it's a short game, afterall) you're reading logs dealing with esoteric matters of what conciousness is and the difference between the mind, identity, and the physical. Admittedly, it compliments the games mechanic of swapping bodies and interweaves it in a commendable manner. But the way the developers go about informing you on these plot points is lacking. There's something to be said of storylines that don't go on long expositionary strings of dialogue and opt for weaving the plotline into the game through files, flashbacks, and other subtle forms. But it's a delicate art: you have to make sure the gamer isn't inundated with incomprehensible information from the outset, and have to slowly peal away the layers of the plot in a way that is simplistic and understandable. This game has sadly failed to master the art it so desperately wishes to practice. It wants to create a sense of loneliness through its absence of cut-scenes, yet opts to include a few mid-way through the narrative; it wishes to have you slowly figure out just what is occuring but instead leaves confusion.\n\nBy the end of the title, you have a solid enough grasp on the story to find the ending worthwhile. But that won't stop me from chastising the sloppy narrative at the outset. But the failures in story-telling are due to the successes in atmosphere. The developers wanted as much silence, loneliness, and eeriness as possible. While it succeeds in creating an ecosystem of melancholy and, strangely, sorrow, the trade-off was an explicit and concrete narrative. It's impossible to dictate the peculiarities of the overworld if you wish for everything to be as quiet and non-obtrusive as possible.\n\nUltimately, the narrative is really my only criticism. So far I've only complimented the developers success in their atmospheric goals. But let me add another one to the pile: the games mechanics. Ultimately, that's all we're here for, right? And the developer delivers. Gameplay revolves around a device that allows you to place clones of yourself throughout the world, empeded only by distance and light sources that dictate the terms of your abilities. Is the light source blue? You may only swap with existing clones. Red? The converse is our new reality: clone placement is acceptable but swapping isn't. Such a simple mechanic, but the developer has crafted a variety of puzzles that build on it and keep it fresh. It almost reminds me of Portal, really. One mechanic that is built upon and used in a variety of ways.\n\nAs a whole, the title is worthwhile and one of the few indie titles that legitimately deserves the praise it gets. But please, don't pester me about it's 'moving' plotline. While it definitely has points of interest, the manner in which it delivers them detracts from their otherwise perfect and original premises. It's a shame. But that fault aside, the game is an enjoyable puzzle game that stretches out a simple mechanic to its limits and has a style and atmosphere of its own to set it apart from other games. Being unique is quite possibly the one thing games strive for and what matters most, and this title presents a style that is worth noting. Titles like this are short enough that it's difficult not recommending them.\n\nWu-Tang motherfu*ker.","May 10, 2014","true","11.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It deftly tackles tough philosophical conundrums such as the nature of consciousness, identity, and the importance of survival, whilst skilfully weaving crafty puzzles with engaging plot-telling and immersive visual settings made by hand.\n\nPrimarily, the puzzles involve the use of clones and the Swapper - a teleportation device of sorts - to locate and acquire security orbs which help unlock different areas within the Space Station Theseus.  The puzzles are typically compartmentalised within single rooms; they typically are relatively short and, whilst tricky in parts, are certainly doable by more causal players with some attempts.  Since there is no combat whatsoever within the game, puzzles confer the meat of the game's challenge.  They mechanically work well and are typically not subject to frustrating pinpoint accuracy or poor handling.\n\nThe bulk of the plotline is narrated by a female character - the only other humanoid character alive in the space station - and who guides and directs many of your explorative actions.  Her confused identity and purpose of being is gradually unravelled as the game progresses, to a perhaps surprising end.  Memory logs and the sentient stone 'Watchers' bulk out the storytelling methods and each tells a slightly different type of tale of their own.\n\nThe visuals and audio eccentuate the general sense of aloneness the player experiences as they wander through the space station.  The visuals frequently speak of a place that almost feels frozen in time, and have quite a distinctive look with the oft haze-inducing light effects.  Meanwhile, the subtle ambient music engenders a sense of longing for company and, perhaps, finality.  Whilst the player is not technically alone, the curious 'Watchers' (who can be met in every other room) tend to provide more questions than answers, and the other humanoid inhabitant on the station provides only fleeting moments of solace as she wrestles with her own multidimensional problems.\n\nThroughout the game, a certain moral debate of sorts is broached, and the debate comes to a head near the end, where the player must make a potentially emotionally impactful choice.  There is no right answer to that choice, nor is either answer necessarily a sweet one, but both choices are meaningful in their own way.\n\nOn the downside, the game is quite short and lacks much replay value.  When the game is complete, the player must begin from scratch if they wanted to recheck a log or seek out a secret room, which is suboptimal design.  The secret rooms are only findable if someone goes in with the expectation of looking for them, and the memory logs within said rooms could have been utilised to portend more meaningful messages.  Finally, whilst the ambient music sets the scene well, there was room for a more dramatic and memorable piece or two within the game as well.\n\nOverall, if you want a relatively short puzzle-centric isolationist game that tussles with morality and philosophy along the way, you'll enjoy this game.\n\n\n\n\n","June 23, 2014","true","7.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The Swapper immediately assumes you are an intelligent person and presents your mind a smorgasbord to feast upon.\n\nAt it's core The Swapper is a 2D puzzle platformer that uses a simple yet powerful gimmick to challenge the problem solving part of your brain.  You get a device called 'the swapper' and it allows you to create up to 4 clones of yourself which mimic each move you do.  You then can swap direct control between any which one in firing range and then chip away at some masterfully designed puzzles which remain challenging but never frustrating.\n\nThe narrative of the game is best left for discovery, but I will say it will please anyone with an affinity for sci-fi short stories.  The questions that askes you will have you long pondering its themes long after you take a break or finish the game.  And its themes are multifaceted and varied and I can easily see myself diving in for seconds and thirds.\n\nVisually The Swapper is outstanding.  The vast majority of the visuals were crafted from clay and household items and work to give it a real organic feel.  Paired with a ambient sountrack that floats between giving sensations of isolation to painting portraits of beauty, they work in tandem to create an atmosphere that completely captivates you in the game world.\n\nIf you happen to be one of those psudo-intellectuals such as myself and enjoy chewing deep and philosphical questions and happen to love games as well, The Swapper is an experience well worth your time and money.  I can't speak highly enough of it.","February 21, 2014","true","5.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I am subjectively biased by the more serious tone and sci-fi setting though. The story is light, but engaging. The derelict space-station setting provides a miraculously haunting atmosphere. Characters are voiced adequately, though the performances border on becoming too withdrawn (which is part of the story/setting, but felt extreme at times). Very short, though still quite fulfilling. If most plot driven titles are novels, then The Swapper is ultimately a great poem; metered, personal, and interpretive. A beautifully sad journey and a striking metaphor for real human struggles with individuality.\n\nComparable games: Braid, Super Metroid, Portal","April 13, 2014","true","10.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game allows you to explore a space station orbiting around planet Chori V. Gameplay is mainly exploring and solving puzzles to get orbs which allows to open new areas of the space station. The plot is somehow outright creepy, which catches the gamer's curiosity and it leaves an open interpretation of facts in the game. In my own opinion the whole concept is well written and well done. Graphics and audio give the sense of what is going on in the game and create a sinister atmosphere. The achievements are not straightfoward though and it takes a while for the gamer to understand how to get them. I played once the whole game without getting one.

It plays like Limbo, what that entails is the player character is floaty, the controls are rudimentary and the driving force is ingame/inengine cutscenes with a certain vagueness to them.  However it isn't linear like Limbo and has a Metroid Prime structure to it, with datalogs/internal monologues.  So that should give you an idea of how it will play and what you will experience.\n\nWith that said, the puzzles are simple at first, but get pretty devilish as the game progresses.  The music is fantastic.  The whole game feels like a visionary Sci-Fi classic, presenting you with the questions and some thoughts on them, but never supplying anything close to a concrete answer.  I don't know how to explain the graphics, but looks like a 3-D/claymation effect without really being either, in my opinion, which isn't a bad thing since I like the look.\n\nI randomly started playing it one afternoon and could not stop.

The game takes place in a beautifully realized science fiction setting; as you traverse an enormous yet desolate research station orbiting an alien world, you begin to piece together an understanding of the events which led it to such a state. However, with each bit of information about the past that you uncover, new questions about the present begin to appear.\n\nOverall, The Swapper is a game that accomplishes a lot without overstaying its welcome. It's short enough (roughly 3 - 6 hours) that despite puzzle mechanics that are fairly limited in scope, it rarely feels repetitive, and it leaves you satisfied but wanting more.

Moist Panties","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CPTMOISTPANTIES/","261 products in account","An indie title that is, shockingly, good. I'm not being facetious, I do believe that the majority of indie titles coast by easily on gimmicks such as 8-bit graphics or meme spouting that earn them undeserved praise among the gaming public. Some indie titles try way too hard to come off as intellectually stimulating and are heralded by people who are accustomed to triple A titles that stopped trying long ago. Being accustomed to ♥♥♥♥, they uphold anything that is remotely different as a godsend without looking at it individually and critically, falling prey to the hype and hysteria that comes with a community desperate to stick it to big name publishers by praising tiny developers without criticizing as readily due to a crowd that is too easily swayed by chiptune soundtracks or 8-bit graphics and faux-intellectualism.\n\nSome of that is present here, sadly. The plot starts off by throwing you into the thick of things, giving you logs to read without any context or attempt to ease you more readily into the game's story. Soon enough (it's a short game, afterall) you're reading logs dealing with esoteric matters of what conciousness is and the difference between the mind, identity, and the physical. Admittedly, it compliments the games mechanic of swapping bodies and interweaves it in a commendable manner. But the way the developers go about informing you on these plot points is lacking. There's something to be said of storylines that don't go on long expositionary strings of dialogue and opt for weaving the plotline into the game through files, flashbacks, and other subtle forms. But it's a delicate art: you have to make sure the gamer isn't inundated with incomprehensible information from the outset, and have to slowly peal away the layers of the plot in a way that is simplistic and understandable. This game has sadly failed to master the art it so desperately wishes to practice. It wants to create a sense of loneliness through its absence of cut-scenes, yet opts to include a few mid-way through the narrative; it wishes to have you slowly figure out just what is occuring but instead leaves confusion.\n\nBy the end of the title, you have a solid enough grasp on the story to find the ending worthwhile. But that won't stop me from chastising the sloppy narrative at the outset. But the failures in story-telling are due to the successes in atmosphere. The developers wanted as much silence, loneliness, and eeriness as possible. While it succeeds in creating an ecosystem of melancholy and, strangely, sorrow, the trade-off was an explicit and concrete narrative. It's impossible to dictate the peculiarities of the overworld if you wish for everything to be as quiet and non-obtrusive as possible.\n\nUltimately, the narrative is really my only criticism. So far I've only complimented the developers success in their atmospheric goals. But let me add another one to the pile: the games mechanics. Ultimately, that's all we're here for, right? And the developer delivers. Gameplay revolves around a device that allows you to place clones of yourself throughout the world, empeded only by distance and light sources that dictate the terms of your abilities. Is the light source blue? You may only swap with existing clones. Red? The converse is our new reality: clone placement is acceptable but swapping isn't. Such a simple mechanic, but the developer has crafted a variety of puzzles that build on it and keep it fresh. It almost reminds me of Portal, really. One mechanic that is built upon and used in a variety of ways.\n\nAs a whole, the title is worthwhile and one of the few indie titles that legitimately deserves the praise it gets. But please, don't pester me about it's 'moving' plotline. While it definitely has points of interest, the manner in which it delivers them detracts from their otherwise perfect and original premises. It's a shame. But that fault aside, the game is an enjoyable puzzle game that stretches out a simple mechanic to its limits and has a style and atmosphere of its own to set it apart from other games. Being unique is quite possibly the one thing games strive for and what matters most, and this title presents a style that is worth noting. Titles like this are short enough that it's difficult not recommending them.\n\nWu-Tang motherfu*ker.","May 10, 2014","true","11.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Especially with all these indie developers vying to be the one to finally get games recognized as “art”. But as Facepalm Games seems to understand, art isn’t about the destination. It’s about what brought you there.\n\nThe Swapper does not lack for artistic content. All of the visuals are made from clay models and other real-world materials, given a fancy shader to make your unnamed spaceman’s flashlight bounce off their surfaces realistically. It’s beautiful in its simplicity and effectiveness, invoking a mood very reminiscent of the cult-classic 1972 sci-fi movie Silent Running.\n\nThe Mr. Spaceman you play, comes across a strange device that lets you create clones and swap between them. All the clones mimic your movements exactly. The first time you get so caught up in solving a puzzle that you forget which one was “you” (which you then accidentally kill), is a very memorable moment. If a clone dies, it’s no big deal. You just make another. But there’s only one of you. Right?\n\nThe puzzles get tricky, but frustration is offset due to the open-world nature of the space station. While you are gated somewhat, multiple puzzles are available to you at any time.

It seems that every month we get a new game that either attempts to emulate Braid's successes or fail at developing it's own identity. The Swapper is the kind of evolution of this genre that should have happened after Braid.\n\nTasked with exploring a very eerie space station, your character stumbles upon a device that allows him to create a small number of clones of himself. Along with cloning, you can "swap" between the clones with a press of a button. Once you obtain both features of your swapper gun, you are left to explore and solve puzzles to continue your journey.\n\nThe set up may be simple as hell, but the puzzles are very creative. Everything from lateral thinking to reaction based puzzles and even some that limit your clones from the standard 4. While this may have gotten boring if dragged on for more than a few hours, developer Facepalm Games knew to take their idea, extend it to the max and then finish.\n\nEven if the campaign can be beaten in a mere 3 hours, the hand-crafted visuals will likely perplex you. How anyone has the talent to mold clay into digitized sets is astounding. Everything looks real because it actually is. Even so, the game never wastes time to flaunt it's looks. The story moves along nicely and the game keeps the puzzles coming.\n\nThe story is very intriguing, too. Thoughts of what swapping means, what it is to be human and whether or not survival is of the utmost importance make for a game that will constantly have you scratching your head. It's a testament to the gameplay that I actually felt the need to rebeat the game just to get the second ending (instead of Youtubing it).\n\nThere really isn'y much else to say about the game. I do believe the price tag is a bit steep, but even getting the game at half-off is well worth it. If you are a fan of puzzle based games, I whole-heartedly recommend this. Even if you're not, it never hurts to go outside your comfort zone for a truly unforgettable experience.\n\n8.5/10","February 9, 2015","true","7.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I am, however, not as fond of the "gravity-swapping" element added partway through.  It never seemed to mesh well with any of the other aspects of the puzzles, as they were all tightly designed around the Swapper device and combined well together.

Of the several dozen puzzles the game offers, I couldn't solve about 4 of them (requiring me to search the interwebs for a solution). Just a thought: if certain lights prohibit you from either making a clone, swapping with a clone, or both, then why not just break those light bulbs? We wouldn't have a puzzle game I guess lol.\nThe Swapper has my highest recommendation, a must play for puzzle game fans.","March 11, 2015","true","5.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With the overall theme of the game, it actually proves to be quite deep if you pay attention and take the time to think about it for a bit.\n\nAs mentioned before, the main puzzle mechanic of the game is to create clones of yourself which move simultaneously with you and which you have to place in the right spots to trigger switches and so on. Additionally, you can freely switch between all created clones and take control of them so they become the 'main character', which is especially useful with puzzles where you tend to die.\n\nDying is actually a large part of the puzzle experience as you will have to first figure out how the puzzle is supposed to work before you actually solve it and that will definitely produce some, uh, collateral damage. Luckily enough, only your main character can actually die, which will cause you to respawn in the room you're currently in.\n\nTo add a bit of challenge to it, there are red, blue and purple lights placed in the enviroments, which will prevent you from either creating clones or swapping between them - or both. Around halfway through the game, another puzzle mechanic is introduced where you have glowing platforms on the ground and/or ceiling, that will alter gravity and basically flip you upside-down (similar to VVVVVV), which adds another tad of challenge to the puzzles.\n\nPersonally, and despite the above mentioned challenge mechanics, I found the puzzles to be fairly simple and relatively easy for the most part. There definitely were some tough nuts among them, but unfortunately those were the exception to the rule.\n\nVisually, the game looks fairly cool and gets even cooler once you realize that all of what you see there 'is constructed using clay models and other everyday materials'. The lighting, depth of field and bloom also add a lot to the atmosphere of the enviroments, though I would've wished for a slightly brighter level design as some areas are literally pitch black.\n\nWith around 5 hours of playtime, The Swapper isn't overly long but feels just about right for the game. Unfortunately, it doesn't really offer any replay value unless you want to replay it for the sake of paying more attention to the story and dialogues.\n\nAs a PSA: If you plan to get the achievements in the game (which require you to find 10 hidden consoles), make sure to do it before you activate the final 124-Orb terminal, as this is a point of no return and you will have to replay the whole game again in case you missed any of the achievements.\n\nAll in all, The Swapper is a really impressive debut game of Finnish developer Facepalm Games and I'm definitely looking forward to see more quality games like this from them.","August 4, 2013","true","5.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The gameplay is good.\n2. The game mechanic is good.\n3. The game mechanic is in relation with the plot.\n4. This is not a puzzle-platformer. Just a puzzle. Which is good for most people who has little time in their hands, and just wants to burn a few away.\n5. The puzzles are simple, yet complicated in a way in correlation with the game mechanic. It will make you think for a lengthy time. There were only 2 puzzles that I was stuck for a long time, but it may be so more or less to other people. These are not creativeness-dependent puzzles. These are puzzles which you need to be very observant to get through.\n4. The music is soothing, wonderful, creepy, and scary all at the same time. It blends with the whole environment of the game.\n5. The aesthetics and graphical fidelity are gorgeous. If I recall, they made most of everthing out of claymation or just clay.\n6. The plot is unique as with most indies are. But this is rather a sad one.\n10. You only have two(2) choices. Either you live your independence, or join in the great chain.\n\nThe story is rather obscure for most people who played the game. There are different explanations, but one thing is for sure.\nYou aren't controlling a person. You are controlling a clone.\n\nIf you finished the game, and want to know more about what the hell happened. Check out some interesting discussions at the game's forum.\n\nI recommend this for people who likes puzzles.

There is much emphasis on plat forming but there is still enough in there to be called a plat former. The puzzle sections in this game are great. I would say the puzzles are not too hard and not too easy either. I would like to say that the puzzle is as good as the puzzles in portal. The idea of this game is to be able to create clones of yourself and place them in areas and switch minds with them to collect orbs. There are switches you need to hit; red light that prevents you from switching minds to a clone; blue light that prevents you to make clones; purple light which has the effect of both red and blue lights.\nThe bmg (Background Music) of this game is also great but i would imagine this is arguable with a lot of people so I may be in the minority on this one. The background graphics in this game look great with enough detail to things around you which will amaze you. Though i do not really like the player/human models in this game that much nor do i really like the animation of the characters but it didn't really get in the way with the gameplay. The controls are pretty decent but with a slight "clunky" feel to it which doesn't really matter too much in most puzzle games but in some section which involves a little bit of plat forming elements can cause irritation.\nThe storyline gets in the way with the game. It not much of a story and I didn't even bother reading half of the note left around in the ship. Then again, the only puzzle game that has a good storyline to it is portal so i guess having a good storyline in a puzzle game in really needed.\n\n\n*SLIGHT SPOILER*\nAt the end there is a chance of choosing to different endings. I have seen the 2 different endings and I feel that both endings aren't much of an ending but I guess the storyline in this game was much to start with.","February 28, 2014","true","5.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The puzzle mechanics are the same throughout the entire game but not once does it feel repetitive or samey. Variety keeps the landscape moving.\n\n* Very challenging puzzles that force you to think to overcome\n* Distinctive style that helps the game feel obscure and alien\n* Subtle but powerful narrative\n\nMistakesThis is such a well crafted game and the developers have clearly went for quality over quantity, opting to make sure everything is done right. There really are no glaring issues with The Swapper\n\n* Maybe a little too hard towards the end for people looking for a more casual exploration\n* Arguably too short, more content might've lifted the title a little higher\n\nRecommendationsThe Swapper is priced at £11.99/13.99€/$14.99 which is fairy priced on the spectrum of games of this type, but some might consider it a little high when looking at its 5 hour playtime. Fortunately it regularly goes on sale for -50% or less.\n\nIt's also available on GOG where it's a little cheaper, and includes some wallpapers to boot.\n\n* There are a number of hidden messages, achievements and rooms throughout The Swapper. You can view them here if you don't mind the spoilers","May 29, 2015","true","6.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Great and challenging puzzles, the learning curve is perfect, not easy by any means, but not hard enough to legitimately frustrate you. Atmosphere was great, very creepy and Super Metroid-esque. My only two complaints are both subjective and personal. I find the soundtrack a little bit lacking, and found myself playing my own music in the background because the nearly silent soundtrack put me on the brink of insanity(not literally). I don't know, maybe that is the point, having a spacey barely-there soundtrack just to give you the creeps. Again my own opinion. The other complaint is the story, maybe I'm just stupid and I completely missed the plot, or the story is just so spread and vague that no one knew what was happening. I think they tried to do something similar to Bioshock where survivors leave notes or recordings of their experiences etc. and you the player pick them up and infer what is going on. Although these memory stations are plenty, they are too vague to be of much value. Maybe it's like Inception, you kind of have to watch it like 5 times to get what exactly is going on.","March 7, 2014","true","36.9"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

(Spoiler, hover over black area to reveal text)\nThis game truly portrays the story in entirely pertinent fashion.\nIts somber, progressively haunting atmosphere is incredibly satisfying to play through.\nFor a 2D Puzzle Platformer, the graphics/art style suits it so well.\nAn occasional parallax effect on the background is not overdone at all and is extremely fit for the scene when used.\nThe long and drawn out shadows combined with the aforementioned atmosphere compliment each other extremely well.\nThe bloom effects can become a bit much, but I personally loved them.\nThey gave a feeling quite reminiscent of a dusty, abandoned area which is the main setting for most of the game despite some well lit areas. (Spoiler, hover over black area to reveal text)\nAll of these combined with the soundtrack in The Swapper bring out a rather solemn sentiment throughout the game.\nThis last feature was the one that really, really sucked me into this game. Kind of like reading a really sad part in a book. You want to keep on reading but as you read, you just start to get the feels.\n\n\nOverall, I give this game a solid 9.5/10","April 3","true","1.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You recieve a device known as a Swapper which basically clones you to up to four different clones. Over the course of the game you have to collect orbs by solving not difficult, not easy, but challenging puzzle games to collect these orbs and completing certain objectives\n\nOverall the game is amazing, the backgrounds and the characters are all made in clay and uses the stopmotion technique for movements and such. This amazed me to bits, and the environments and atmoshpere blend in well with the sound effects and visual effects of the game\n\nThe music fits well in this game too, The Swapper's minimalistic music made me feel like I'm alone on this spaceship and the atmosphere alone made me scared and on my toes to think that there are any enemies about, which thankfully there isn't. The very little voice acting there is is also played very well\n\nThe puzzles as mentioned before are not difficult, not easy but challenging. Some of the puzzles require you to find a solution, especially the ending puzzles. All puzzles need to be completed to encounter the ending and all 124 orbs need to be collected. It may look a lot, but there are only 42 puzzles in the whole game\n\nThe length of the game really made me upset, I completed the game in under 4 hours, which is so short for such an visually beautiful game, but with the challenging puzzles, I am glad to say that I finished the game in that length of time\n\nThe only complaint I have is the Swapper device itself, for you to create a clone you have to press the RMB, sounds simple enough and it is, and the LMB is used to teleport to that clone you created. The complaint I have is that sometimes I press the LMB and nothing happens, and if there is a bit where I am falling and need to get on a ledge and I create a clone and press the LMB and nothing happens, I die and have to do it again! Thankfully, the game has an extremely fair checkpoint system so it's not a big of an issue\n\nThe Swapper is a visually striking and atmospheric game. It pulled me in into its 4 to 5 hours playtime and has an amazing story which kind of reminded me of Frictional Games' SOMA and the ending made me question myself if I made the right decision or not\n\nThe Swapper I would highly recommend to anyone but it's not for everyone, the challenging puzzles can put some players off, but with some googling and walkthroughs, you can get through the challenging puzzles. The Swapper is an amazing sci-fi platformer game that everyone should give a go. Whether they like an interesting story, love sci-fi as a genre or challenging puzzles\n\nRECOMMENDED :)  THEPCGAMER'S BEST GAME IN STEAM LIBRARY! (What's this? :- Like some games get "Best Game of 2014" or "Best Indie Game", etc... So I have decided to make my own!)","May 9","true","4.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As far as recent platformers go, Braid and The Swapper are best there are. Not just in terms of invigorating gameplay, but the writing and music, they're so strong. The atmospher in The Swapper was gorgeous, beautiful and breathtaking. The animation was simple, but it didn't need much to show off, it already had the intriguing intro to keep the player going. The puzzles are strange and sometimes complex.\n\nIn The Swapper, you play a stranded astronaut, or scavenger that lands onto an abandoned space ship, Theseus, or at least it appears abandoned. It is one of seven ships meant to gather resources for Earth, as Earth has exhausted all resources. You have to find a means to esacpe, by solving puzzles, collecting orbs, collecting data to find out what happened to the crew and why they were so keen into the telepathic rocks/Watchers. The story is mystifying and refreshing for its ambiguity and intelligence of space, time, the mind, and life. It's almost philosophical.\n\nI can't say I've played a game where you can generate clones and swap bodies, while controlling them all at the same time to solve puzzles. I know other platformers use the clone ability for puzzles, i.e.; Braid with its time controlling, Mario for its bizarreness, and a few others. But The Swapper perfects it for forcing you to use your clones, not to your advantage, but to your necessity.\n\nIt's fascinating to know that The Swapper's art, sets, characters were all claymation. It give itself a distinct art style you wouldn't reguarly see in videogames, especially since most video game art is done digitally. So seeing the seemless claymation in a videogame just goes to show that claymation is not a dying art form. I would certainly like to see more indie video games take this approach, as it is unique and, when done well, looks outstanding.\n\nI can't say enough about this game, it's simply outstanding.\n\n10/10","March 19, 2014","true","6.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Probably won't be an issue for most users, but if you have problems reading in low light, you may need to occasionally head over to a wiki to read up the terminal logs.. otherwise you might end up missing a rather thought-provoking story. Still highly recommended however.\n\np.s: The achievements in this game be maybe impossible to find on your solo playthrough. Unless you are extremely lucky, you are going to need a guide.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Creamium/recommended/231160/","Creamium","Creamium","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Creamium/","107 products in account","The Swapper is one of the best puzzle games I've played. The puzzles get challenging fast, but they're designed in a way that the solution always seems within reach. Sometimes it's more straightforward than you thought, but the more devious ones are more complicated than they first seem. Either way, sometimes I'd just enter a room, try to figure out the riddle, then quit out the game and take a break if I didn't find a solution. But I never had the temptation to check out a guide. I loved the design in the puzzles too much to succumb to that. It's also way too satisfying to figure it out on your own, even if some are complex.\n\nBasic concept of The Swapper is that you can create up to 4 clones of yourself, which behave exactly like you do, and you can swap consciousness with them. The consequence is that the body you leave behind is just an empty vessel, which you can use as a tool, a means to an end.\n\nThe developers actually run with this concept and a big part of the (surprisingly great) story revolves around the clones and the concept of a soul and the complexity of mind and matter. The story resonates because you are constantly hands-on with the overarching theme of the game. If you have to do a cruel thing to one of your clones, it hits home. The memorable finale is a culmination of all the soul-searching (and swapping) you had to do to get there.\n\nThe Swapper could've just been a series of brilliant puzzles and I would've loved it already, but they fleshed it out and created an interesting universe around it. To top it all off, there are the numerous echoes of Metroid and Alien, giving you an eerie sense of isolation.\n\nRarely do you get such a flawless fusion of gameplay, concept and story. This game is a gem, that a lot of people seem to be sleeping on. You shouldn't. Play it, it's brilliant.","July 29, 2015","true","25.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

In other words I've thrown in the towel for the time being, but most certainly NOT because this isn't a ♥♥♥♥ING EXCELLENT GAME.\n\nSee, I'm over 40 now, and despite having not consumed all THAT much alcohol for a human of my years, I still only have so many brain cells to go around...and a large number of them have recently been dedicated to the practices of getting up ridiculously early (like, before MIDDAY, for ♥♥♥♥'s sake), showering and dressing (in more complicated clothes than a pair of shorts and a t-shirt with holes in it), brushing my teeth and hair, spraying on some deodorant, then getting on a bus and doing a six hour shift - that's SIX MOTHER♥♥♥♥IN' HOURS, goddammit - in which I fiddle with reams of paperwork.  So when it comes time to drag my weary ♥♥♥♥ home and put on some well-earned games, I'm really not up to anything which requires as monumental a mental effort as this absolute little GEM of a puzzle-platformer.  This game is SMART, yo.  Almost too smart for me at the best of times, and frankly way over my head in its current state of cerebral short-circuit.\n\nSo yes, after getting, I dunno, maybe half-way or so through it, I've had to put this game aside for the time being...but believe me when I say I WILL be coming back to it.  Between the ingeniously imaginative clay-built visuals, the cleverly-implemented cloning device your character uses to multiply himself, and the completely logical yet sometimes mind-♥♥♥♥ingly hard puzzles themselves, this game has QUALITY written all over it.

These clones all move together, so positioning them can be tricky and its further complicated by coloured areas that prevent either the creation of a clone, or swapping to it. The goal is to collect enough orbs to pass checkpoints. Early in the game when stuck on a puzzle you can skip it and solve another, but by the end you have to solve everything. I was disappointed that there are no new abilities to add new mechanics later in the game. Length depends on how quickly you solve the puzzles, took me 6 hours but I used a guide because my last 3 puzzles had me totally stumped. The story is weak. You're dropped in with no explanation of who you are or what is happening and by the time it provided some answers, I'd lost interest. I don't mind a mystery, but you have to start me off with a reason to care.

The game immediately strikes the eye with a very atmospheric setting. The whole environment is beautifully crafted. To fully enjoy this, playing on a high resolution is recommended. The originality of this game is out of question. By creating clones of yourself, you have to try to get to things. The game slowly gets you going to get used to the cloning mechanics. The puzzles are challenging enough to give you a sweat, but never leave you frustrated. As the game goes on, the story unfolds with messages coming in different forms.

A "PortalTroid" if you will.  Know what I'd rather be playing instead of this game?  Metroid and Portal.\n\n\nGreat graphics\nNice (not great or good) music\nNice controls\n\n\n\nNow to cut to the chase.....the story is terrible.   The characters are bland and are easily forgetable.  Rather than speaking lamen's terms, everyone has to talk in a damn riddle with complex English....stuff that won't even matter in the end.\n\nThe puzzles can be good, but you'll learn soon enough that they're just there to prolong the game.  The game doesn't really reward you for getting farther, it instead throws more philosophical crap in your face.\n\nI tried to make myself like it.  Even after a 2nd playthrough just to figure out what the **** happened without getting many answers.\n\n\nIf you want some puzzles with a twist, go for it I guess.   If you want to save your sanity, pick up Metroid or Portal and save yourself a lot of hassle.\n\n\nEDIT:  I tried a 3rd playthrough of this game since I've seen many people rate this review down.....sorry, but I simply can't say it's a good game.","March 11, 2014","false","13.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There isn't a ton to it, but it took me about 7-8 hours to finish. If you have an easier time with the harder puzzles, you might go faster. Once I knew the solutions, I could run through it again in under an hour, so it's really a two play-through game. More on that later.\n\nFirst, the game looks great. I grabbed it for the appearance and ambience and was not disappointed there. It is very creepy and pulls off its intended asthetic well. The lighting is done extremely well.\n\nYou start by landing on a mysterious planet after having been sent off a space station in a drop pod. Then you find a device that lets you clone yourself and move into the different clones. You use this to solve puzzles and a story is slowly put in front of you. Often the clones will die, and often you will have to kill them to solve the puzzle. I went from not liking this, to not caring when I found out it didn't matter, then finished wondering if it actually did matter, but not being sure.\n\nAs far as the story, it is told well. Most of the game, I thought it was a good story. There are some strange things going on, though the story might actually reveal a little too much that would have been better left mysterious. Eventually there will be a big reveal that is somewhat meaningful. Also, subtitles will matter, and I'd recommend having them off on your first play, then running through it again with them on.\n\nThere are two endings. One is supremely unsatisfying and even stupid, and the other is questionable, but at least interesting.  Unfortunately, it autosaves but does not allow multiple load points. And one of these saves is the credit sequence. In an unbelievably silly oversight, in order to see the second ending, you have to run through the entire game again. And you can't go back and watch one of the several dialogue sequences either.\n\nUltimately, I'm glad to have played the Swapper, but I'm also glad I didn't pay full price.","July 9, 2014","true","8.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lutsy/recommended/231160/","lutsy","Vaylute ♥","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lutsy/","695 products in account","The first thing I want to make clear is that this is not a bad game. It's actually a very thought-provoking, puzzle-intense, short-but-sweet sci-fi adventure with elements reminescent of movies such as Moon, or Alien (sans the jump scares). It's well done for an indie title, and its high metascore is deserved. It's just... not my kind of title, and I don't want to recommend a game based on what it does well, but how -I- enjoyed it.\n\nThe core element of this game, its raison d'etre, is the ability to create clones of yourself and to swap into those clones to explore and advance, while attempting to escape an abandoned craft. There are a number of puzzles woven into the narrative that at times stunned me at their cleverness, and the story really makes you think about what constitutes 'you' rather than 'your mind'--but I won't get into spoilers.\n\nWhere the game falls short is just -how- frustrating some of these puzzles can be, and frankly, a number can be a bit tedious. Games like Quantum Conundrum can get away with this because of the humorous and light-hearted atmosphere to keep you entertained, but here, the story elements can sometimes feel a bit few and few between. That, and I kind of feel like the game is a little... pretentious? Like it's trying -too hard- to make you think, and it throws you into the story in media res and makes you put the pieces together, as though that makes it deeper than it naturally is.\n\nOther than that, the game doesn't have much else that stands out to me. Visuals are decent, as is the voice acting, but there's scarcely a sound track, and the hidden secrets in this game are -insanely- hard to find without a guide. I found myself both bored and frustrated more than I did intrigued and delighted, and that's a kiss of death for me when it comes to puzzle platformers.\n\nMaybe this is someone else's cup of tea, but it's just not mine.","January 17, 2015","false","5.8"," 26 of 53 people (49%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","49","26","53","2","1"

I stress the word partial because I went into it expecting more by way of philosophy of mind and was left disappointed by its unwillingness to follow through with a number of themes it establishes early on. While the game’s central mechanic - the use of a gun to create clones - concerns the idea that the soul can endure different bodies, and the story concerns a race of advanced aliens who've transcended their bodies, the game clearly favours testing players with puzzles over getting them to ruminate over the story. The puzzles themselves are decent, unlike the atmosphere, which is genuinely great, as are are the claymation animations, which provide some splendid death scenes. About a year ago the writer, Tom Jubert, went explained why he didn’t think the writing integrated with the gameplay perfectly and having now finished the game, I completely agree with him. There’s a decent puzzle game in there and it's enjoyable enough but I think it bites off more than it can chew.\n\nRecommended for people who like to think their minds and bodies are separate but really just wanna solve puzzles.\n\nLength: 4 hours; Difficulty: Medium/High; Spaceships: Check","April 24","false","3.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It looks great. It sounds great.\n\nStory:\nI have to say, I am impressed as to how they came across telling it.\nIn Swapper you explore the Station Theseus, in a Metroidvania style, solving the mystery as to what happened, and why it happened.\n(If you don't know what a metroidvania is, just google it)\nBeware, there are 2 endings to the game at the end. Make the right choice.\n\nGameplay:\nThe game itself is a collection game. Get # orbs to activate # things.\nYou solve these puzzles to get these orbs to advance the game and therefore the story.\nI honestly don't care about this. I enjoyed the game mechanics as much as I enjoyed the story of it all.\nThe puzzles were great. They utilized the game mechanics perfectly.\nIn order of game mechanics appearing: cloning/swapping, buttons, lights that prevent you from cloning/andor/swapping, gravity changing.\nSlowing down time is a vital mechanic that made this game so much fun as well.\nMid way through the ramped up the difficulty of the puzzles. I admit I had to use a few guides to figure them out.\n\nVisuals/Sound:\nThis game looks so good. The claymation was fantastic, I didn't even know it was clay at first until I read it somewhere.\nAnd the sounds were satisfying to hear. I sometimes ran forward/back just to hear the doors slide open/closed.\n\nThe achievements in this game are secret terminals that you have to search for.\nMake sure you try to find them before you activate the 124 terminal though, that's the point of no return.\n\n7/10 This game impressed me. The storys great. The puzzles are great. And it looks and sounds great.\nWhy are you still reading this? Buy this game already.

Not so hard and "quantic" as antichamber but, a really good one.\nIf you enjoyed Portal, Antichamber and, that kind of surprisingly fresh takes on puzzleing games then, you OWE this game.\nThat people that says it's short is because they went to some guide to solve the three or four really hard puzzles it has. Just a few seem impossible to imagine how to solve them. And, I confess I had to check some youtube video with a couple.\nGraphics aren't a deployment of art and technology but, perfectly serve to the overall atmosphear and mechanics of the game. Sound is also in same ball park.\nStory, is just an excuse to link everything toghether.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/elmofive/recommended/231160/","elmofive","Elmofive","http://steamcommunity.com/id/elmofive/","179 products in account","The Swapper is a simple little puzzle/adventure game that ultimately fails to impress. While the cloning and swapping mechanic is neat and some of the later puzzles can be head-scratchers, the game lacks cohesion between its individual elements, leaving the experience somewhat hollow.\n\nThe game begins with you in control of a nameless astronaut after being ejected, for reasons unknown, from a space station orbiting an alien planet. As you emerge from your escape pod planetside, you begin your quest to discover exactly what is going on. It's not long before you find the titular Swapper device, which allows you to create clones of yourself (that respond to control inputs in time with you) and transfer your control perspective between them as long as you have a line of sight. After getting a handle on the mechanics, you quickly come back aboard the space station Theseus, only to find it virtually devoid of life. It's here that the game begins properly, and sticks itself in a very basic loop until the end. You traverse the ship, solve puzzles to find energy-orbs, then use the orbs to power devices that open new sections of the ship.\n\nThe problem with this is that while the game is supposedly about uncovering a mystery, there is no mystery whatsoever in its environment. Each orb is found within its own little isolated room with its own little puzzle. And since these rooms exist only to hold the puzzles, it makes the entire space station feel less like a place where people lived and worked and more like an excuse to give the player some downtime in between puzzles. After all, why would space explorers and researchers need a room with two man-sized switches on opposing sides of the same platform that control colored lights that limit the use of the Swapper? The rest of the Theseus is equally impractical in its design, requiring extensive use of the Swapper just to get around. Granted, it would've been pretty boring to not use the game's central gimmick during map traversal, but the whole thing still feels like shallow pretense.\n\nA potential alternative to these issues could have been to have the space station be thoroughly destroyed, with the orbs placed evenly throught the station rather than in rooms dedicated to them. Crumbling walls, collapsed ceilings, generally broken machinery and other structures could have made the Swapper's unnatural traversal method fit more naturally in the setting. Alternatively, the developers could have done away with the station entirely, making the game nothing more than a series of puzzles chosen from a menu, perhaps with a basic level editor included so the community could create and share their own puzzles, maybe even compete for best times or fewest Swaps a la Portal. But perhaps that suggestion is out of line, as this game has a story that it wants to tell.\n\nThe plot is one aspect of this game that I have no major gripes against. The dialogue is natural, it raises some philosophical and ethical questions about the nature of consciousness, the mystery unravels at an appropriate pace, and its general tone and themes are accompanied well by the visuals and music. My only criticisms are that the cutscenes are unskippable (but thankfully on the short side) and that there are two endings decided by a final binary choice. Normally I wouldn't mind that sort of thing, but unless you do some clever save file manipulation, you'll have to replay the game a second time to see the other one. And since you've already solved all the puzzles and seen all the unskippable cutscenes, it's pretty boring the second time around. The only potential saving grace of a subsequent playthough is finding the hidden text logs to get the achievements, but the vast majority of them are so obtusely hidden, it's unlikely you'll find them without a guide (unless you're a fan of trying to create clones in areas that look like totally solid walls, anyway). And they don't even tell you anything about the story you didn't already know.\n\nHowever, all of that said, this game can be reasonably enjoyable for exactly one playthrough. It's very pretty to look at, pleasurable to listen to, and it story and puzzles will definitely give you some things to ponder. If that sort of thing intrigues you, maybe grab it when it's on sale for about $5 or so. Just don't expect anything brilliant or amazing here.","January 2, 2014","false","6.6"," 38 of 85 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","38","85","0","2"

But that does not save the game from being incredibly frustrating and repetitive.\n\nThe puzzles are mainly made up of pressing buttons that switch red and blue lights off and on, and your having 4 clones that you have to use to solve them. They are made more frustrating by bad controls.\n\nFor example, if you tap the jump button your character barely lifts from the ground, in what seems like a unnecessary move in the game, I found no use for it anywhere. And if you hold in the jump button, the character performs what I would characterize as a normal jump. There are boxes which you have to jump over and drag/push, and too often you don't hold the button long enough, causing the character to instead tilt the box and make it roll away from you, instead of jumping over it. First time I've experienced this in a puzzle/platformer game and it's so bad it almost becomes a deal breaker in itself. Developers could learn a thing or two from Mark of the Ninja, or other platformers with tight controls.\n\nAt first the atmosphere was great and the music augmented that in a very nice way. Unfortunately, once you start rolling boxes around when you mean to jump over them, and you experience the "flap" sound of your clones dying and dying and dying, after you try one puzzle after another, you quickly get bored to death. Puzzles are not necessarily hard, but with the way they are organized it takes time to move around the room and solve them, even if you know and see what the solution is. And you often have to switch to another clone mid-air. If you miss that switch by 1/10 of a second and die for the nth time, the game just deteriorates to being tedious and boring.","March 15, 2014","false","11.1"," 17 of 46 people (37%) found this review helpful","37","17","46","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Captainzens/recommended/231160/","Captainzens","Captain Zenscuel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Captainzens/","594 products in account","I've played this game twice. Rather an interesting concept in the game and the puzzles are enjoyably crafted, though a few require more twitch reflex skills than out of the box thinking and discovery. It has beautifully crafted atmosphere and unrelenting loneliness, and the section with radiation and zero-G are exceptionally fun.\n\nBut that's where the good ends. This game is burdened with two huge things. Non-Intergrated Puzzlers and a story that doesn't even begin to ask the question let alone even provide enough background to surmise your answers.\n\nA bane of puzzlers, pretty much all the key puzzles are rooms, set aside from all the rest to perform route actions to acquire security keys. The rest of the rooms tend to have obvious, at best, to the solutions the problems with. Swap gravity with plates, use clones and swap to when falling. Getting to some of the secret rooms take some doing, but of course they also require you to know there are invisible openings in the walls or when the foreground covers the screen, you to guess that "Oh hey, I should jump!" which you'll find more from cocking about than honest exploration. And this is ignoring, again, teh puzzle rooms are distinct from the rest of the game and just random rooms on the space station with specially made lights to block your puzzle gun which serve zero purpose of being on the space station. The only reason set aside puzzle rooms worked in Portal is because of the testing narrative, puzzle games need to understand that.\n\nSecond, the story. WIthout spoilers, the game introduces a rather radical concept, says a few things about it, and then ends. Since the EFFECTS of the thing aren't even shown until you meet the very end of the game, one would assume then you'd be told some of the things. But instead you spend most of your time on, mysterious rocks. Mysterious rocks. Who's leader is a tiki head. The game doesn't even explain how a bunch of mysterious rocks killed the crew, just that they are all scary and stuff. It's meaninglessly vague. It doesn't add depth for me not to understand how they interact and damage the human psyche. It's one thing to leave the titular swapper's morality and function purposefully vague, I interact with it constantly and me making decisions on it from the effects it has from how I use it does add depth. But since instead of having THAT happen, given the isolated puzzler rooms and people saying no more than vague, throw away statements about it and then back to the ROCKS, you learned absolutely nothing about it than its bare functionality. It doesn't even give you enough information to let you even define a reasonable theory around what exactly is its purpose, how it was made, what technology it uses, or why it can transfer consciousness (Or Souls) around with beings. The entire damn story until the very final choice is entirely centered around those damn rocks.\n\nIf I were to write a story that centered around rocks, even rock golems that could move around or psychic rocks, I would be laughed out of the room as a writer. Nobody wants to hear stories about rocks that somehow managed to kill the crew in some unspecificed manner (Which is needlessly unspecific). I bought the game to discuss and learn about the titular tool. For my money, the game should be called "The Watchers" since that's the name of the damn rocks and that's what the story is about 90-95% of the time. The Swappers moral and ethically implications are left to the wind cause the rocks are way too damn more important than worrying about those things, so lets go solve some puzzle rooms which are apparently how the ship hides its security keys so I guess the entire security staff were armed with swappers to acquire and hide their keys. Only conclusion that I can draw is that as long as you are swapping to the clones, the Swappers a completely harmless tool for leisure and work.\n\nAlso I like how the ending choice is entirely predicated upon first forcing you into a really random button pushing section (Just like all the puzzles) and then, you can see the doodad at the end, but the doodad doesn't trigger until you drop yourself off a cliff you can't jump up back from. And that's ignoring the absolute absurdity of the reason you even need to make the final choice. It's plot convience theater people, this is not good writing or game design.\n\nAt the end of the game I was about to go like "I hope you enjoyed No Moral Theater" but at least they make you at least feel something about your damn choice at the end. So It could be "Hastily tacked on moral theater."\n\nDon't waste your money on this overly artisty yet completely meaningless wash. Braid is far better at least evoking emotions and mysterious wonder, why I ENJOYED it immensely, while this just left me with an intense distaste after the. Instead of feeling my emotions tugged and pulled, I had tension drawn and drawn before just being cut with no conclusions, no revelations, no big anything. Just smash, end, Hope you enjoyed Hastily Tacked on Moral Plot Convience THeater.","December 30, 2013","false","5.6"," 25 of 64 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","25","64","0","0"

You don't have to go through difficult jump passages and there aren't enemies or something similar in the game. You just walk from room to room to solve puzzles with your clones to unlock new rooms with even more puzzles. Every puzzle has to be solved with only 2 abilities: Make clones, and take controll over them. In the middle of the game when the puzzles become more challenging you also use the ability to invert gravity. That makes the game one-sided. The story is only told by text-logs you can find. I think in the puzzle-plattformer genre there're much better games which are more "plattformer" and have more varying puzzles.","March 2, 2014","false","4.9"," 2 of 14 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","2","14","0","0"

Unfair, I know, but the genre has been oversaturated with endless iterations of the same ideas. Swapper does not fit that trend. I was first drawn to it because of the incredible, hand-made clay visuals. After I was drawn in by these visuals, I was hooked by the unique gameplay mechanic of creating clones to accomplish your tasks. These clones don't just do the last actions you undertook, but rather are controlled in sync with the original character (who by now is most likely a clone as well). On top of the intriguing and often challenging gameplay, the beautiful graphics, and the sparse but interesting story, the game also presents a deep philosophical question: what makes you you? In the game, you can transfer your consciousness to any of the clones you create. When you leave an area, and often during the course of a puzzle, these clones die. If you transfer into a clone and the original dies, leaving the clone to carry on your mission and ultimately your life, are you still yourself?","June 4, 2014","true","14.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The result is an unshakeable sense of immersion. The atmosphere is lonesome, the soundtrack is haunting, the voice overs are spot on, and the puzzles are mind bendingly fun.\n\nLuckily the main focus is the physics of the environment (which is completely beautiful). Some of these puzzles, however, require extremely tight solutions that may deter some players. Next to that, I think my only real complaint is the use of the maoi head is a bit dull. Why should this mysterious alien force make use of a human face? I have no answer.\n\nI hope this immersive gem will bring you as much joy as it brought me.

Lemme get this across first that I am a shooter junky and mostly play that genre no matter how beaten to death it may be getting. In fact, I hate playing puzzle games. It goes smoothly at first, but then I just stare at the puzzle more than actually doing anything about them around the mid to end point of these games. I have ADD, so it’s hard for me to get into something that’s not going forward by at least a margin. I’m the kind of guy who liked Splinter Cell: Conviction because you could just shoot the guys rather than waiting for them to pass by.\n\nSo, did this game make me settle down and actually have some patience with a puzzle game? No. I quit the game twice and watched an LP by the pretty cool SA forum poster Niggurath. Because of that let’s play I want to actually complete this game, possibly to a whole. I feel that it deserves to be played as a lot of games like this are a phenomenon in gaming from a design and storytelling standpoint. Examples would be Silent Hill 2 and Spec Ops: The Line that are similar. These are games that make you feel alone. Maybe in different ways where in Spec Ops you are the horrid creature in the game, or Silent Hill 2 where you are alone and fighting the horrid creatures that represent you, or this game where it’s a bit of both except without fighting and without doing the terrible things. Okay, maybe one depending on a choice.\n\nI have a high respect for these melancholy games that get the melancholy right. I’m a person who likes funny stuff that doesn’t take itself seriously. I’m kind of telling you a lot about myself huh? I wouldn’t say I’m extremely critical about a serious story either, but unless you’re really good, some comedic relief would be really nice. Now why haven’t I gotten to the gameplay and ♥♥♥♥? The actual game? I feel like writing this more as a feeling from the game thing because it’s a game with a lot of feelings. I think I got to know a bit about the people who created this work of art and would rather respect them by not putting the typical, “So, the game goes like this!”\n\nAll I’ll say is it’s puzzly, melancholy and pretty. ♥♥♥♥ that, it’s absolutely beautiful! If the game interests you; I advise that you look into it. Don’t just buy it right away. Maybe check out Totalbiscuit's video on it since it's informational and spoiler free.

Lots of complaints about bugs/controllability in the forums, but I had no issues. The price tag on the game is for all the hard work that went into the shape and feel of it.\n\nIn it's basic mechanics, The Swapper a pretty straightforward and fairly linear puzzle game. Some folks have branded it a "metroidvania" title, but it really isn't: you gain all the skills/tools/abilities you're going to gain in the first 5 rooms, so there's never any real limitations built into the game that would impose a need to backtrack. The only thing that could impose non-linearity on gameplay is if you get irritated at a puzzle and leave it temporarily to go solve another. You'll have to get back to it eventually, and when you do you'll be bringing all the same tools to the table as before.\n\nSo, gameplay is fun and demanding the first time through, but fairly formulaic.\n\nThe storyline comes in small doses as you work through the game. A lot of reviews have praised The Swapper for raising philosophical issues about personal identity and consciousness, but reviews rarely actually discuss it. I found the links to philosophy to be pretty heavy-handed. The medium here (a game) is perhaps novel, but the ideas in play are far from it. The guy who handled the narrative is Tom Jubert (FTL, Penumbra), and he clearly knows this: it's as if the storyline, characters, and dialogue were read off of a syllabus for Metaphysics of Mind 101 -- and the game cites the syllabus. Characters named "Chalmers" and "Dennett" bicker over the nature of consciousness (see David Chamers and Dan Dennett). The ship's name is the "Theseus" (see "The Ship of Theseus" problem). All this makes one wonder who the story is written for, exactly. Players unfamiliar with philosophy of mind may not see the not-so-subtle references here, and so won't read into the subtext that's carrying much of the weight. Players who have read the syllabus won't find it very novel.\n\nFor anyone, a difficulty with the story is that it really only comes together clearly in the last 5-10 minutes of gameplay. After a lot of slow and piecemeal development, everything comes to a head, and you're finally able to do what you've been trying to do for hours of play -- so you dutifully race to the abrupt ending, getting heavy doses of information that alter the narrative dramatically. Then, maddeningly, after the ending you're locked out of the game and cannot go back into it to either (a) revisit bits of the story you've collected, now wisened by a deeper understanding of what's been going on or (b)  see the alternate ending  You have to start all over again. But since nothing in gameplay changes on the second run, it becomes a pretty unrewarding grind.\n\nOne thing that might force you back into the game is that you've likely missed all 10 steam achievements on the first run. That's because the developers didn't provide any description of what the achievements are, they're just roman numerals. I honestly reached the ending of the game and thought "Oh, I must be about to complete chapter I, so I'll unlock achievement "I" in a second now and go on to chapter II -- that'd make sense, and could explain the high price of the game; there must be lots more content yet." Nope.  And when you do go track down the achievements, they add absolutely nothing to the game at all in terms of storyline or character or anything.

The dark and lonely space atmosphere, the haunting mystery to solve, the forbodingly thought-provoking gameplay, and even the art style and music, all combine wonderfully into a seamless and immersive tapestry.\n\nThe game reminds me more than a little of Metroid, with its vast map, and ability to back-track. In this game, however, you are not *required* to back-track, but instead you are given a variety of puzzles you can solve. You have to solve them all before the end, but along the way you can pick and choose; moving to a different puzze if one is giving you a hard time. This brilliantly avoids the tendency of most puzzle games to frustrate, causing one to close the game, and sometimes never return. In The Swapper, you don't have to leave, and if you're like me, you won't want to.\n\n** SPOILERS BELOW **\n\nMy only desire for this game is for it to be longer. As I was nearing the end of the Theseus Station plot, I was imagining an entire new stage down on the planet, where I could learn more about the Watchers and somehow interact with them. Then after that, I envisioned, a third stage; set on a rescue ship, where your decisions influence what will happen when you reach home. The real ending was fantastic, but I wanted more of the game!

Combines metroid vania esque exploration and vibes of isolation with mind bending puzzles that can get so complex you feel like a rocked scientist when you finally figure them out.\n\nOnly gripe I had is that there were some puzzles near the end where strictly speaking one could figure out the solution pretty quickly, but due to the mechanics were an absolute ♥♥♥♥♥ to actually pull off due to being split up into phases where if one phase failed to work, the entire process had to be done from scratch. Such a puzzle platformer should strike a balance between the two dichotomies, so its a shame sometimes the game leaned too far either way at times.\n\nAlso the story starts out a bit confusing but becomes more clear and intriguing once a plot foundation is set. In short, it provokes existential questions about how the mind, body and soul work and making comparisons between humanity and a new found alien 'lifeform' (If they can even be called living anyway) which fair to say is surprisingly original in execution.\n\nGraphics wise, it's also very refreshing to see a somewhat hand made look to the models, particularly the protagonist who looks like a rigid mannequin. At first this may seem odd but it only makes the protagonist look that more fragile and defenseless, especially when seeing the protagonist and his/her clones being wasted.\n\nThe soundtrack is also really good and at times reminded me of Interstellar. There were moments I just stopped progressing to the next room because I was too distracted by the musical movements being so good, even long after I completed the puzzle of said room.\n\nThis is an otherwise short game where you spend as much time figuring out the story as the puzzles themselves and I feel that makes this game a very wholistic experience.\n\nHighly recommended.","January 28, 2015","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Added it to my wishlist, and later received as a gift from a friend. Excitedly, I opened it, preparing myself for some engaging cloning puzzles, when my screen went all white, and a message appeared on my screen: 'The Swapper has stopped working". Well, excuse me, the Swapper, who gave you the right to just, stop working?\nAfter many, many attempts of launching the game after restarts, uninstalling, reinstalling and more, the game still would not function properly. I've opened up a discussion, and even contacted Steam Support weeks ago, but have received no constructive help. For this reason, until this issue is resolved, I rate this game 0/10.","January 29, 2015","false","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
