I recommend you turn on ALL visual effects to enjoy this.  Looking at the other reviews 1-2 hours on record of gameplay isn't enough to truly expereince this game. Round 12 + Is where people need to really review this game. If you want fast paced? This is it. Overall the controls are hard to get used to sure but for me a keyboard and mouse are absolutely fine. Once your past the learning cuve this game is a blast. Literally.\n\nThe ships look truly stunning flying past then with their cannons blasting the enemy fighters. And once you are in the higher round and the cruisers are fighting each other its becomes really fast paced. And you can choose to start at round 19 once you reach it and go from there to "Infinity". So it does give you the option to bypass the slower levels once you clear them.\n\nAll in All this game is a 10/10 for me. If you want a High paced Space shooter then this is for you. Graphically stunning and great game play.\n\nCons? Honestly if this had muliplayer I'd be on 300+ hours by now.

You keep going until you die, when you die your score gets added to the leaderboards.\nCombat is part dogfighting, and part Mech mode massacre.

SSI takes SSZ's great combat and puts it into a cheaper and a more "arcade styled" game.\n\nSome features about the combat:\nThe Strike Suit has a "Flux" mode, and when activated, your Strike Suit turns into a "Gundam-sort-mech" that targets more enemies and deals more damage.\nIt's a pure arcade space combat game, just shoot the bad guys and you are good to go.\nThe music helps fuel what is going on in combat. It will play an ambient tune when there aren't much enemies, but once you are on a final wave, expect an awesome adrenaline pumping track.\nI find the game is better played with a Mouse and Keyboard, a Joystick works, but I just prefer the Mouse and keyboard since shooting enemies feels a lot easier, instead of having to constantly move your ship to get a good shot.\nIf you have great memories of space combat simulators (ex: Freespace and Star Wars flight action games), Strike Suit Infinity could be the game for you.","December 3, 2014","true","3.0"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","24","26","0","4"

Unlike the Heroes of the Fleet DLC for the original Strike Suit Zero from 2013, the player now has the chance to earn credits and to build up a fleet of his own that will support him over the course of the game.\n\nThere is a total of 18 missions (rounds). You begin on the first round & move straight on to the next. Between rounds you will be able to build up your fleet, unlock Strike Suit Upgrades by solving bonus objectives & selecting the Loadout of Missiles for use. If your Suit gets destroyed during a round you lose the game and your accumulated score gets uploaded to the leaderboards.\n\nThe game saves your progress if you quit or the game crashes in the middle of a round. The downside to this is that it will deactivate your reached scored from being uploaded to the leaderboard. If you want to have your score uploaded, you either have to die during a mission or play through all 18 rounds in one sitting.\n\nOn the contrary, you can quit your game in the middle of a round, which automatically saves earned credits, ship upgrades, fleet setup. This allows you to continue next time exactly where you left of and play at your leisure, getting familiar with the game or to try out different setups.\n\nPlaying through all the rounds in one sitting is a difficult task that requires knowledge about each rounds adversary, perfect planning of your Fleet beforehand as well as a large amount of experience with the games controls & sometimes chaotic, rough but fun space combat.\n\nIf you love to compete against others, entertaining space combat simulations & a great challenge then go ahead and give Strike Suit Infinity or the original Strike Suit Directors Cut a try. Then let’s be honest there, there aren’t many good 6DOF games out there at the moment and Strike Suit belongs to the absolute best to play right now.\n\nThe original Strike Suit Zero & the Heroes of the Fleet DLC:\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/288370/","June 13, 2015","true","2.4"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

However, and to my surprise, Strike Suit Infinity is such a nice game, I'd say it's even better than SSZ, because they fixed so many problems I felt the original had.\n\n-unlike Zero, Infinity is just there as an arcade kinda game. You ascend higher into the levels and stay alive, shooting as many enemies as you can. mostly for points\n-you can hire escorts, from tiny ships to massive frigates, and they'll actively help you as long as you help them\n-you can upgrade both them and your ship thanks to credits you earn throughout the stages\n-strike suit mode is so sweet, and they actuallly make it more vital to the gameplay by giving you the ability to greatly extend how much you get to use it. Plus, right off the bat you get a good selection of strike suits with different abilities, since you can unlock 1 pretty early, and the other is right behind it.\n-overall a light and fun experience\n\nEven though I still find issue with the controls, the game is far more lenient in intense firefights, but there's still challenge. They really did improve the core of the game. So yeah, buy it if you can, on sale or no.

You get thrown in a preset stage and you work through them.\n2. I don't like having to manage credits and my fleet. If you want (need) a good fleet to take on the later stages with, the amount they give for selecting the stage isn't enough. You need to have it built up from several earlier stages. Also, your fleet does not carry over. Buy 2 frigates? Both of them live? Well say goodbye after the round is over, and no you aren't refunded credits.

The other thing I hate is how the controls don't center off behind the cursor so if you pitch up, you'll just keep going up indefinetely until you manage to balance your cursor completely. Maybe that's just me though. The one thing I hate the most though, is the missile alert system.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RpiesSPIES/recommended/234160/","RpiesSPIES","RpiesSPIES","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RpiesSPIES/","129 products in account","When I first considered getting this game it was for a few things:\n1. Combat looked quite similar to a space MMO I used to play and love (I knew this was not an MMO-style game, but the gamePLAY is what I am feeling similar) and it also appeared very skill-based (aside from the mech-like form)\n2. What seemed like smooth flight controls and the sort\n3. Upgradeability (which was my biggest inclination to purchase this game, as I love games in which they give you the option to stat-build, pick skillsets, as well as upgrade items/abilities/etc.)\n\nHOWEVER, when I start playing this game, the feel of the game is very clunky and not as smooth as it makes itself out to look (holding S to reduce speed actually tries to make you go reverse, giving you poor camera control when attempting to slow down). Also, when in combat, the gameplay is more like your average airplane shooting sort-of game where you must lead your lasers (which I don't mind much, aside for it being in a space combat game) and the missile lock-on is very slow and unappeasing (very bland missile animation).\n\nI summed up just a few small things right there, but to address the biggest thing that pulled me in, massively disappointing me in the end was the customization and ability to upgrade your ships.\n\nBased on my reading, I knew there would only be 3 ships to choose from, that's fine, but when the only way you can upgrade your ships is by destroying a freighter in order to obtain a predetermined upgrade instead of providing a skill point or whatnot, greatly limiting your creativity or playstyle. Also, you gain points every set of waves. What do you use these points for? You use them to hire small fleets of allies and rank up their AI. You gain points at the end of each set of waves based on how many allies survived, then they VANISH. Your allies do not stick with you through the sets of waves, only for ONE SET. After selecting your allies to come with you and whether you want to upgrade their AI, you get to pick your primary and secondary weapons... HOORAY!!! But... You are unable to pick different lasers than the base selection given, and you can only swap one of your missle slots for the other missile you already have equipped and naught else. This customization may improve later on, but for the first ship available, that is all you have access to.\n\nAlso, the mech form along with auto-aim (hold left-shift to snap to the next target once your current target dies + turn to face them!) is so overpowering, I just run into a mob of enemies, activate, hold shift, and shoot my primaries to end up with a combo of 8 enemy ships killed or whatnot. The mass-missile aiming makes close to no sense that I have no clue what ships it's locked on to nor do I have any idea why it's possible to lock on to the same ship more than 3-4 times (around 15 or so locks is the limit).\n\nThe map size is larger than needed, at least for earlier rounds. It doesn't give you enough time to fly between objective targets (like freighters so you can get upgrades), and if you do it takes off 50-70% of the time you have, leaving you with too little time to kill the enemy wave in time for the multiplier bonus (this is not helped when the enemies spawn on all 4 cardinal direction entrances).\n\nThe gameplay is very flashy, and it builds itself up a lot. I wasn't expecting much, but I got less than I wanted and I am generally displeased with the way this game has turned out to be.\n\nOn the upside, the game looks very nice and follows through with being just wave after wave of combat. If that's what you're looking for, then go ahead and get it, if not, look elsewhere.","December 23, 2013","false","0.6"," 21 of 39 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","21","39","2","0"

First time you encounter enemy frigates you're like "whoa", it really feels like a boss fight, taking down all the weak spots, then the game throws 2 or 3 at you.\nIn combat mode you're a space fighter taking down other ships with missiles, machineguns etc., but you can transform in this badass mecha for a limited time to take down everything with high tech weaponry (which changes based on what Strike Suit did you choose).\nThe visuals are stunning, beautiful, I don't care about graphics but sometimes I look at the backgrounds with awe.\nThe sound and music are great and very fitting, I like them very much.\nThe combat is fast-paced and pretty difficult, even if there are 16 levels, you'll be probably stuck on level 5-6 or something.\nI would recommend this for everyone, the price is a joke compared to the quality of the product.\nThe only downsides I can find are :\n- Lack of multiplayer (local or not);\n- More buying options for flavour.","June 20, 2013","true","5.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It takes all of the mechanics, visuals and sounds from the first game and distills them down into a tight, concentrated arcade mode that will test the skill of even the most seasoned Strike Suit veterans.","December 31, 2013","true","6.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Extremely shallow but ultimately satisfying. A game that's all about the gameplay and the gameplay is great. Taking down a battlecruiser in a battlesuit armed with a railgun has never been more satisfying. Game is perfect with the payoff vs effort. Taking down little interceptors feels just as great as taking down a huge carrier. Dogfighting is just as fun as switching to mech mode and putting the hurt on a capitol ship. Every mission in the game is challenging but rewarding. But it's not so challenging that it's impossible to beat but you have to really try. Space combat games has sort of fallen out of fashion as of late and while many people have said that it's not a very good space combat game by comparison to others out there I found it immensely fun and satisfying.","November 26, 2013","true","5.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Looked cool from the trailers but for all the glitz and glamor and sleekness the gameplay, controls and mechanics leave a lot to be desired. It's all flash and no substance. It's just an arcade game, so no story, just basically playing through progressively harder arenas. You make money, but you just restock allies with it. There are different levels and upgrades of guns, but after clicking every button in the menu I couldn't see how to change levels or change guns, and they never changed through the time I played. This lack of change leads to repetition where you just repeat the same fight with the same enemies using the exact same guns with the exact same ship, with a little different space background (which do look very cool by the way). Yes its fun to change into the gundam and use it but this is where it faulters. You need to destroy a bunch of stuff before the gundam becomes usable, and then using a few rockets or your worthless main gun (which never seems to do anything) drains your charge and you have to switch back. It basically means all this work to use the cool thing is limited to little spurts and you are mostly a ship. Also the gundam is way too sensitive, and I found them hard to use, even after turning sensitivity down. There just didn't seem much to this game. Also you get shot from like 30 different sides and you don't have barrel roll or any moves as the ship so you just fly forward/up/down and use your boosters, but so often you keep getting hit and it seems impossible to get out of being fired on, especially because it seems to come from all over. There just wasn't much to this game. Maybe Strike Suit Zero would be more interesting. Graphics aren't bad. And the ship combat with guns/rockets aren't terrible. 5/10.","February 26, 2015","false","2.7"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","29","2","7","2","0"

I played days of Descent Free Space 16yrs ago, and that game is even today a much much better space combat game than this.","September 5, 2014","false","1.0"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","0","3","2","0"

The battlefields are immersive and large, and can provide quite the challenge at times.

It has nothing to do with space combat.\n\nWhile in the fighter mode, the shots do almost zero damage, you basically just collect energy to change to the mech and oneshot everything with built in auto aim. If you expect real space combat like seen in the old privateer series or something similar you are wrong. In strike suit infinity all you get is a massive overload of special effects flying left and right.\n\nThe game even lacks the very basics, for example: there is no radar, you can barely see what is going on, how many enemies there are, where there are etc. There are other major flaws in the controls, as even though you auto aim at locked targets you will miss everything that is not locked no matter where you shoot. This forces you to cycle through endless amounts of targets before you ever get to the one you want to shoot.\n\nSo in the end, this is not a space combat game.. the only fight that requires skill is the fight against the annoying controls.","August 10, 2014","false","0.3"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","0"

The control is complex yet intuitive once you can remember all the functionality. I definitely love the concept of having the ability to pilot spaceship that can switch into mobile assault units. This game is really fun and the controls reminds me of Freelancer (Another great space action game).  The detailed environment and flashy weapon animation is really great.  They are so good that I am willing to overlook the fact that there is no storyline. The graphic itself really let you experience what you would expect piloting a cool hybrid spaceship feels like. I highly recommend this game if you are looking for a fast-pace shooting game that have a high learning curve.  The better you are at making complex manuever of your ship, the more enjoyable this game will be.\n\nUnfortunately, the tutorial fell short. For those that are new to flying action games, you will be left with a lot of things to figure out. On top of the fact that you will spend a large amount of time to learn basic flying mechanic, you will have to deal with very fast pace action and lots of small details on the battlefield like: incoming missles, incoming mines, shield level, lock-on timer, EMP timer, dodging, aiming with different guns that have different fire-rate, etc. All the details can be overwhelming for those new to the genre.\n\nThe interface tries to be straight forward so you can enter the action quickly. But. This means that you can easily be confused of what the interface try to convey. They gave a list of ships you will encounter each level. Okay? Can I get the stats of each ship to plan out what I want to do? They gave you ship upgrade screen. Yet they did not mention that you don't interact with the upgrades on the screen, the only time you get upgrades is when you kill certain optional ships in the actual level.  The screen is there to review the upgrades you own.  They gave you a fleet information screen so you can get allies and upgrade your fleet. Yet they do not give enough information for the upgrades and ships so you can make good decision.

I'm glad I bought it at only 1.74, on a 75% off steam sale, because it's not worth much more. If you're curious, definitely wait until that sale happens.\n\nPros:\n+cool graphics\n+decent, but short music (also a con)\n+several weapon varieties\n+several ship options\n+Really Cheap game (seriously, 1.74 on a 75% off sale, 7$ normally)\n\nCons:\n-AI is relatively poor in some ways, not dodging even with max upgrades\n-Lacks Replayability once you know what to expect and how to use money\n-allies don't carry over into following waves\n-requires several runs to get full upgrades that stick\n-instakill enemies exist\n-your ships are equal in power to enemies, meaning having allies only helps you live, not helps kill them (oftentimes they kill less of the enemy despite 'even' footing)\n-lack of in game difficulty allowance\n-lack of in game 'cheats' to allow goofing off.\n-scoreboards always have cheaters or people with 'trainers' on them, devs don't care\n-Modding scene is nonexistant, despite forum threads saying essentially 'omg, this tool is so good for x y and z drooool', nothing has been released other than that tool worth mentioning.\n-forum threads clearly exist just to make players feel like they matter. They are now filled with heavily misspelled advertisement posts or old threads with no dev updates in sight.\n-Continuing doesn't give you nearly as many credits as you would have earned, and it doesn't record how well you've done so it can give you your best credit score amount for that level. Prepare to grind from the beginning for what you were supposed to have\n\nAs stated above, this game was really fun at first, and i got my 2 dollars out of it, but after a quick revisit, even grabbing the trainers so i could wade through all the bs easy levels and get max credits and see what happens with a fully maxed fleet, only to get instakilled by kamikazee with a 30 min investment, I called it quits.  Just like some people get frustrated with Zero for easy things you have to wade through to get to the fun challenging things, this is no exception with my last con point.

This game has you piloting a Strike Suit against waves of enemies in a space simulation, ranking you on how well you do, how many of your allies stay alive, and the like. In all the game has 18 segments, each comprised of a different number of waves. You can jump into any segment you've progressed to, or run through linearly until you explode. Combat and flight feel nice and solid, with missiles and guns to use and a detailed lock-on system, a lead-target indicator, and the ability to switch between equipped weapon sets.\n\nThis game adds more to that, however, by including a system called strike mode. As you kill enemies and complete objectives, you'll fill a bar which powers strike mode. You can switch over at any time you have some in the bar, as far as I can tell, and turn into a gundam-style slaughterhouse of awesome. Even in this mode, kills will still extend your strike suit time, and attacks made cost tiny chunks of it. It feels very fun to switch into strike mode, paint locks on a squad of enemies, sidestep a missile, and obliterate all of them in a swarm of death-dealing return missiles.\n\nThe game is difficult, with a regenerating shield you'll loose often if you arn't careful, and a health bar that takes damage when your shields can't. Over time, if you go after the optional enemy frigates that warp in, you can unlock upgrades, new weapons to use, and a limited number of ships.\n\nStill, it's a fun, face-paced space combat game, very worth it for the price.","July 16, 2013","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's no plot to hook on to, just guns, missiles and the rush of your ship's afterburners as you weave through your enemy's flak cannons.  If you're a fan of space combat games, you can't go wrong for five bucks.  For two bucks on a Steam sale, you'd be stupid not to buy it.\n\nBesides, it's not like there's anything else to play in this dead genre until Star Citizen comes out.  At least this is a good title.\n\nAll that said, I still prefer Freespace Open (FS2 enhanced) as the undisputed KING of space combat.  While there's no anime-inspired mech suits, the ships controls feel more intimate, the graphics are better, the explosions are bigger, and the plot is actually gripping--surprises work, your heart sinks at the enemy's doings, you hate Command's "intelligence".

While the game is absolutely gorgeous from its settings to music, it suffers from a few fatal flaws that made it hard for me to enjoy. The main problem would be the controls, I spent half of my time trying to make the damn craft fly straight. The other half was trying to dodge. The acceleration and combat aspects feel similar to a free roam Starfox, but the target reticle is near impossible to control. The enemies are too shifty to actually line up a shot making the dogfights feel chaotic at best. Mostly the missions consist of mayhem. If the aiming worked more like a first person shooter, I wouldn't have a problem with this game at all. But the game instead works on a scrolling system. If your crosshairs are even the slightest off centered, then the ship will move in that direction rapidly, so you constantly have to find the center of the screen to fly straight. Keep in mind that I had the game sensitivity and my mouse sensitivity set to the lowest possible setting. This game should take a page from the Tachyon games in my opinion. To sum up, this is a gorgeous game with an immersive atmosphere that put me in the cockpit, but the controls really made me dispise massive dogfights.

NOPE. I stumbled upon the store page and thought the game looked amazing and decided to buy it, since it was rather cheap. After the installation, the first problem reared its nasty head, being that the acursed thing wouldn't start up. Eventually I had found out that it would crash if my controller was plugged in. I found that rather odd, but was excited that it would finally work and I would have an amazing time. That is, until the game punched me in the face with its controls. It works on a WASD control scheme, which I have no problem with. The problem was controling the bloody ship. I couldn't keep it stable, let alone fly in a stable direction. Every other control was fine, but I couldn;t control my movement virtually at all. It was like being stuck in the litteral middle of the ocean, underwater and all, in a submarine with a rotor on each side, all of which are spinning in a different direction.

In Infinity we can allocate what kind of reinforcements we’ll be using in certain rounds and there’s a bigger incentive to try and save your teammates. Overall Infinity is fun and much tougher than Zero by far. A good challenge for those who’ve graduated from Zero.\n","June 20, 2013","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The one and only problem in this game is the aiming system - when I press the keyboard for "the nearest target", I want to lock on to a torpedo which is XXX units away and not a corvette, that is XXXXX units away. I simply cannot protect my allies against the nearest targets. Thats it. Im going back to Strike Suit Zero. Otherwise, it is an awesome game. The positive review I wrote in the past about Strike Suit Zero still applies.","February 2, 2015","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Having both Strike Suit Infinity and Strike Suit Zero, it feels as though they split the gauntlet skirmish mode and story mode of one game up into two separate games that should have been sold as one game at a slighty higher price. Further, it has not received the improved graphics or additional strike suit that were provided to the Strike Suit Zero Director's Cut. Infinity is enjoyable the first playthrough and it has more replayability than Strike Suit Zero. However, it still has limited replay variety after all 18 missions have been unlocked. No mission editor, no modding, no modding community.\n\nI cannot recommend it due to the above points.

While the game is absolutely gorgeous from its settings to music, it suffers from a few fatal flaws that made it hard for me to enjoy. The main problem would be the controls, I spent half of my time trying to make the damn craft fly straight. The other half was trying to dodge. The acceleration and combat aspects feel similar to a free roam Starfox, but the target reticle is near impossible to control. The enemies are too shifty to actually line up a shot making the dogfights feel chaotic at best. Mostly the missions consist of mayhem. If the aiming worked more like a first person shooter, I wouldn't have a problem with this game at all. But the game instead works on a scrolling system. If your crosshairs are even the slightest off centered, then the ship will move in that direction rapidly, so you constantly have to find the center of the screen to fly straight. Keep in mind that I had the game sensitivity and my mouse sensitivity set to the lowest possible setting. This game should take a page from the Tachyon games in my opinion. To sum up, this is a gorgeous game with an immersive atmosphere that put me in the cockpit, but the controls really made me dispise massive dogfights. Worth a try if you find it on sale.","February 14, 2015","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

NOPE. I stumbled upon the store page and thought the game looked amazing and decided to buy it, since it was rather cheap. After the installation, the first problem reared its nasty head, being that the acursed thing wouldn't start up. Eventually I had found out that it would crash if my controller was plugged in. I found that rather odd, but was excited that it would finally work and I would have an amazing time. That is, until the game punched me in the face with its controls. It works on a WASD control scheme, which I have no problem with. The problem was controling the bloody ship. I couldn't keep it stable, let alone fly in a stable direction. Every other control was fine, but I couldn;t control my movement virtually at all. It was like being stuck in the litteral middle of the ocean, underwater and all, in a submarine with a rotor on each side, all of which are spinning in a different direction. Also, hope you don't have motion sickness, or else your computer screen will have a new paint job.\n","July 11, 2015","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can go up, down, left, right, spiralling into the distance, and use many different types of weapons and 3 different ships. You can even spend credits you earn in battle to purchase better pilots and better reinforcements.

Strike Suit infinity, I reckon, is infinitely more fun than Strike Suit Zero. These reasons I will examine in my Strike Suit Zero review, but the reasons Infinity stands above its fellow brother game I will show to you now.\n\nFor one thing, Infinity is strictly a wave-based space combat game. There's no story, no real context, no different maps. You pick your space suit, your guns, your friends, and then test your luck in the open field.\n\nIt's surreal to see the potential of the Strike Suit series without Zero's terrible story and terrible game saving functionality. SS Infinity ends each level with the last wave, and then you choose whether to keep fighting or not.\n\nStarting a mission restarts the points collected thus far, which buy allies and suit level ups. I don't understand why you cant just have a save game screen to solve this issue of continuity. What if two people want to play the game and have separate stats without forfeiting their progress?\n\nGameplay is wonderful, if not tiring due to the heavy loading screens in between each and every battle. It's about a five minute wait, which feels like a waste of time if not just straight up poor design. It just tire sout the audience, then you'd much rather shut the game off than try for the fourth time to kill the enemy space battleship\n\n\nGood game, but it feels like the gaming is milked out of the player.\nIt's still better than Strike Suit Zero, simply for having fewer hassles, fewer game crashes, slightly more sensible save game options, and lack of a terrible story.\nStill, nothing new is added, so Infinity feels more like a clean up job to make Zero more of a practical arcade shooter.\nStrike Suit Infinity performs its gameplay admirably, but this shiny spot is only contrasted by all the problems surrounding it.\n\n7 out of 10","November 29, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There’s definitely a huge emphasis on player skill (weapon/ally selection, missile-lock dodging, 3D nav, etc.) in order to advance through the 18 stages. I was able to get through 9 stages in about 3.5 hrs, and that was with way too many cups of coffee. I think this game would be a lot of fun with a joystick and multiple monitors. The music really gets the adrenaline going too (especially in the last round of each level). Tons of fun, but a little too intense for casual gamers.
