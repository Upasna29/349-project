"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Badinfos/recommended/353090/","Badinfos","Badinfos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Badinfos/","53 products in account","https://youtu.be/xFLcyRYcyuM\nMy review will be separated into different parts covering the many different aspects of the game. First a little bit about me:\n• I purchased it in November from Interaction Studios' official website for €11.25\n• Total gaming time: 19:53:22h + 03:11:00h (from Steam) = 23:04:22h\n• Times I completed the game: 15\n• I have played all previous Chicken Invaders games (11 total - including the special editions)\n• I made a  Video review  ,  Fan trailer  and a  Full walkthrough  of the game.\n============================\nNow for the actual review:\n\nDifficulty The game has 3 difficulty settings. One of the few differences between the 3 is that the enemies become more bullet spongy than the previous difficulty. If it takes you one shot to kill an enemy on rookie, it will take you 3-4 to kill it in Superstar Hero.\nThe second thing that changes is that on higher difficulties the enemies drop more keys (used for unlocking stuff), but that's only because the enemies stay longer on the screen. You can get the same number of keys on lower difficulties if you don't kill the enemies quickly.\nThe third difference is that on higher difficulties you get more points. Points which are completely useless on Steam because you cannot use the official site's leaderboards.\n\nGame length The length depends on the difficulty you play at. I timed the last 3 times I beat it:\n• Rookie: 01:01:34h\n• Veteran: 01:16:16h\n• Superstar Hero: 01:29:28h\nThis does not include the cutscenes. With a rough estimate I guess the cutscenes are about 35 minutes long. Is that worth the 4,99€ you will pay for it ? Yes. Is it worth the €11.25 I payed for it ? Yes. I've completed it 15 times and I am still not bored of it.\n\nSteam / non-Steam versions The Steam version is very crippled and I see no point in owning the game here. If you buy it from the official site you will get so much more content, the most important is:\n• Leaderboards. You can compete against many people in the world.\n• You will get all future special editions for free (judging from Chicken Invaders 4 there will be 4 versions). On Steam you have to buy every one separately. Let's do the math:\nYou pay €11.25 for all versions from their site. You pay €5 + €5 + €5 + €5 = €20 on Steam. If you don't care about special editions it is still not worth it because you can not use the site's leaderboards.\n• You will get a free Steam key.\n\nImprovements from previous titles ... or the lack there of. This is the same game that it was before. Every game before this one had something unique about it:\n• CI1 had 10 levels repeating until you lose all your lives (you can play forever)\n• CI2 had more than one weapon and the ability to move vertically\n• CI3 had proper working mouse support, overheating weapons and a good storyline\n• CI4 revolutionized the whole genre. So many more weapons. Tilting/zooming camera and so so so many other improvements.\n• CI5 has nothing new. Sure you have 3 unique levels, but the game is the same.\nIf you are going to buy a Chicken Invaders game, buy CI4, that one is a lot better than this one. The levels have a lot more variety and the enemies and bosses are more interesting.\n\nWeapons We have 3 new weapons in this one. 3 completely useless weapons I should say. They are terrible and I avoid them at all cost. If I play the previous CI games I will not miss these 3. The other problem I have is that you can complete the whole game using 1 weapon: the green one. It is great for everything. There is no need to switch to other ones. This problem is apparent in all CI games, the green weapon is always the best. There should be a reason for me to use the other ones, but there isn't.\n\nUpgrades While playing, randomly an enemy will stat glowing yellow, if you kill it while glowing, it will drop a key. If you collect enough keys you can unlock certain abilities. There are 31 upgrades and you need 3700 keys to unlock them all. In 23 hours I have collected only 1026. The upgrades unfortunately are not that appealing this time. Especially for Steam users. Lots of them are for getting +?% more points. Points which you can't use in leaderboards. Don't get me wrong. These are great.... but for non-Steam users. Most ones are cosmetic and have no point. Others are completely useless as well. CI4 had better unlockables. These ones are not that bad though....... (for non-Steam users)\n\nOptions and performance • Music and sound have different sliders\n• You can adjust your keyboard's sensitivity. WHAT!? When have you seen that in a game!? Awesome feature, unfortunately you would probably never use your keyboard. The mouse works for everything.\n• Togglebles (on/off): Cheats, In-game help, Satelite auto-fire, mission progress.\n• V-sync and a separate frame limiter (goes up to 125 fps), Fullscreen on/off, Letterbox, Show fps, Texture filtering\n• 2 language options, they are adding more currently.\nI have no idea why, but the Steam version for me runs like crap. Before/after every wave the game freezes for less than half a second. That half a second is enough to get me killed. The non-Steam version doesn't have this problem. All my other Steam games don't have this problem, even other non-Steam ones. My PC is a beast and runs the newest games on max settings, so this shouldn't happen in Chicken Invaders. Again- the non-Steam version runs fine with no hiccups.\n\nStory It's decent I guess. I like the humor of the game. There's lots of reused jokes however. I like the storyline of the previous 2 games a lot more than this one.\n\nAbout the company I have big respect for InterAction Studios. Their games have always made me smile and have kept me interested for 10+ years. Their customer support is perfect. I have contacted them 2 times before and they always give fast responses. The last time I contacted them I asked them for my free Steam key. I e-mailed them at the end of the week (late friday). First thing in the morning on monday I checked my e-mails and what do you know.... my free Steam key was there. Even though I was a little disappointed with the newest Chicken Invaders game, I think you guys are amazing and deserve a lot more fame than you have. I wish you the best of luck in the future !\n======================\n\nI guess that's everything, I can't think of anything else to mention. If you guys have any questions about the game then leave a comment and I will answer them.\nIn short I recommend the game, but I recommend Chicken Invaders 4 more. Both games are great, but CI4 will remain my favorite.\nBe sure to watch my:  Video review  ,  Fan trailer  and a  Full walkthrough  of the game.","March 19, 2015","true","6.9"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","21","25","0","1"

The types of weapons you get are gifted to you by the chickens you slaughter. You get little weapons or satalites that follow you around and you can fry them with a giant plume of fire. After you eat enough chicken you built up bombs of explosive gas. Just press enter to shoot your fart bomb you've been saving up for.\n\nThis really is a cluckin good game!

Even though it's more of the same -which is good- there are some changes this time around which harm the enjoyment a lot more than they help it.\nExtending a theme from CI4, your ship often rotates (not freely) to add some variety to the levels, but this time around there is a stronger emphasis on pointing you the wrong way and making you wait until you're able to shoot the remaining foes. Furthermore there is an entire chapter devoted to "reverse" top down shooting; meaning that instead of the foes at the top and you shoot upwards, the foes are at the bottom and you shoot downwards. While it doesn't sound like much, it is so completely against what you're used to in this type of game that it gets annoying very quickly.\nThe other change related to the rotation is that now the "gravity" goes wherever your engines are pointing, so if you're pointing right then the pickups, eggs and keys will fall to the left. I don't like this change either, at least when gravity was always downward you'd know where exactly to look after destroying foes.\nThere are a couple of side-scrolling terrain-avoidance levels, these are okay but they're basically change for the sake of change. The new weapons are all rubbish and once you've tried them all out you'll be avoiding collecting them because the older powerups are just better.\n\nIt's hard to recommend Chicken Invaders 5 because Chicken Invaders 4 is better in every way, even the story and humour were much better in the previous game. Regardless of if you're new to the series or not, just go with CI4 it's way more fun.","January 14","false","15.1"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","1"

No, of course it isn't.\nIs it well worth the tiny asking price? Hell yeah!\nThere's a lot of nice touches that I didn't expect at this price point and it looks and runs great.\nIt's simple enough for youngsters to enjoy it and there's enough content to keep a (young at heart!) adult entertained for a while too. I found the unlockable extras a bit too slow (they're mostly cosmetic and I just didn't care enough...) and the "SQWUARK!" of dying chickens eventually gave me a headache, perhaps not one for the alektrophobes.\nOther than those (minor) gripes though, I liked it. And if you're feeling the urge to kill some chickens, it's much cheaper and easier to acquire than a shotgun license.\n\nJoin me for a light-hearted look at Chicken Invaders 5 on Youtube:\nhttp://youtu.be/Ihxb4aQEj40","April 6, 2015","true","7.8"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

With this game being new weapons, maps, waves and unlockables.\n\nTook about 2 hours to complete the game on the easiest difficulty, after one failed attempt, enjoyed it with no real sense of tedium. There are many, MANY unlockables and customization to keep you busy, I can see lots more runs before getting bored then coming back to it every now and then.\n\nOverall, it's a great game at a great price.","December 31, 2015","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Just buy it, its A.W.E.S.O.M.E. I just bought this game today and i finished it 2 times! (rookie and veteran modes) 8.5/10 , multiplayer is hell when you have low connection + the game is sadly not really long ;(.

As a chicken, I find this highly offensive. This is an insult to all chickenkind.\n\nBut it's also a lot of fun. Blast space chickens, get power ups, play with a friend. Lots of different weapons. Good sound, good graphics, simple controls.
