It's a lot of samey corridors and crates.  So many corridors in this terraforming base, so many crates.  There are a few offices and bedrooms (I guess) and some store rooms for variety but everything generally looks the same.  The environment is very, very bare bones, not much detail.  Exploration is not a driving force of this game.  I did get stuck once among some crates, so be careful where you jump about. (edit:  may be fixed in future patches.)\n\nThe corridors are often maze like and everything is so samey looking that it's easy to get disoriented and discover yourself running around in circles once you've opened up enough doors in some sections.\n\nThere's a bit of a story that's told in fairly decent English (I've seen worse) but it seems pretty generic.\n\nThere's some puzzle solving, most of which is fairly simple.  There are at least 2 sliding piece puzzles.  I hate those with a passion.  I'm currently stuck on the 2nd one.  I don't think I'm going to spend any more time on it.  The game is just not compelling enough to warrant the effort.  edit:  (well, since I bought it...)\n\nIt's been stable for me, no crashes.  Also, at the time of this review you can rebind some keys, but not movement keys.  If you don't use a standard QWERTY keyboard know how to switch keyboards on your OS.\n\nEdit: key binding for movement keys seems to have been fixed in an update.\n\nI got past the one troublesome (for me) puzzle and finished the game, which took about 5 hrs total.  This game is more "escape the situation" than walking simulator or exploration game.  Not much story but enough to explain what is going on.  Decent enough if you are into that type of game.  For the price, compared to other $10-15 games, I thought content was lacking a bit.","February 23","false","5.6"," 35 of 45 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","35","45","2","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/patjo/recommended/444580/","patjo","Patjo Lieus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/patjo/","40 products in account","This game was not my favorite\nIt has a lot of potential though, with more development time it could be a really great game.\n\nPros:\nI enjoyed the choice of minimalist sound effects.  Throughout the game the only sounds are of your footsteps, machines/computers running, and wind.\nI am a math nerd,  so having the first password be a reference to pi was cool.\nMehs:\nThe visuals were fairly good.  I was running it on the highest graphic settings and it was good enough quality that I was able to loose myself in the game and was comparable to other indie games.  The elements did get a little repetitive over time.   Having worked in the sort of facilities as the games settings (larger confusing maze like industrial buildings) I can tell you that people would normally designate different areas with colors.  The game uses a system of door numbers, but these didnâ€™t seem to have any internal story meaning.  Rather, the next door you needed to go through had a higher number than the last door you went through.\nThe storyline was interesting, but it could have been filled out a little more.  The information was delivered via messages and log entries of the evacuated crew.  The messages lacked much in the way of emotional content and that they were arranged in chronological order as you play through felt contrived.  Having time stamps and presenting them out of order would have felt more realistic.\nThe puzzles were hit or miss on the level of difficulty and enjoyableness.  The types of puzzles were  connect the dots using circuit relays, slide puzzles to connect circuit relays, and matching puzzles to connect circuit relays.\nCons:\nThere is one section that almost made me quit the game.  There is a section of the game where you have to traverse a room via jumping on top of containers to avoid a deadly radiation anomaly.   It felt forced and disjointed with the rest of the game.\nThe ending is terrible.  It feels imcomplete.","April 1","true","11.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Although having them in the game was a nifty thing, I found the sound being the same to be kind of cheating. And when you load into a new area, for some reason everything in your hand magically vanishes.\n\nOverall it's not terrible but I still would not reccomend it, it has the ability to be a pretty fun puzzle game/story game. Though the difficulty to the puzzles were, to say the least, extremely easy. There weren't many bugs, aside from the once where I'd get stuck, yes I could probably have avoided those areas, however I like to explore in these kinds of games, and having some place that is basically a trap is not good. Though being able to get into all those places is fun. The game was not at all clunky, though everything moved slowly, there was no run button, i.e. you walk to make sure the game takes longer to get from point A to point B.\n\nThe sound and the "backdrop" or walls of the place were all so bland, Footsteps on an ever Diamond plate-like floor, Baseball and tennis balls that sound like the basketball as you throw it against the square/rectangular tiled white or grey walls. The occasional loud beeping sound of a system panel thing sending a warning. (Though I have to add you can disable those on the panel which I liked that little addition)\n\nAs a first title from this dev, I have played many firsts that were much worse. This isn't terrible, it's a good first puzzle game. However it has much missing, and could use a little more personality. If I could give this game a Neutral score, I would but there is none.\n\nOld review with 15 minutes gametime everyone is complaining about. I bought this game with the hopes that it'd be a decent story game. The premise of the story, although pretty over-used, seems like it could be a good a good story. However after walking around for 10 minutes looking through empty offices, long time wasting corridors and only hearing the sound of the footsteps, an occasional shake, and the normal spaceship electricity gone haywire sounds I found myself jumping over a box and getting trapped in an area I could not get out of. From the gameplay up until this point, it seems like the majority of the story/gameplay is going to take just long enough so you can't refund, be grey, sometimes shades of white, and maybe a red or orange something every once and a while.\n\nWhich a good 10 minutes into a game, the creator of this should have played through that part enough times to ensure someone didn't get trapped somewhere.\n\n(Photos of said Trap)\nHere[images.akamai.steamusercontent.com]\nAnd here[images.akamai.steamusercontent.com]","February 23","false","1.8"," 75 of 137 people (55%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","55","75","137","13","20"

But this is part of the game design and it doesnâ€™t distract the atmosphere at all.\n\nThe story is told by computer terminal log files only. There are 20 sections, each of them need to be completed at once. (Auto save at the beginning of each level.) If you die at the end of a level, you have to start all over again. But if you are carefully, itâ€™s not a big deal. (mostly) All puzzles are logical and overall easy to solve.\n\nIt is up to you whether 6-7 hours of gameplay is worth the price, or not. For me it is a clear recommendation.\n\nUpdate: The last level is pretty challenging (tough puzzles & huge maze) and the end is not satisfactory... but still didn't change my mind.","March 3","true","6.4"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"
