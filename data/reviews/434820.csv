This is a very unique and very enjoyable puzzle game.  Basically it's crafting made into a puzzle, with area management to effectively craft the right items at the right place, so you can continue crafting everything else you need to make the finished product.\n\nThe puzzles are multi-stage crafting, e.g. you first need to craft some flint, then you craft a pointed stick sharpened flint and a stick.  Then you use the stick to craft something else, or craft an animal separately in another location, and use the pointed stick to skin the animal, which in turn you use the animal pelt to craft the final item.  And so on, and so on . . .\n\nThere are lots of levels, and I can see them getting really complex and thought provoking.\n\nThere are also a bunch of challenge scenarios, that are deemed expert level only.  I haven't tried those yet, but it's just more goodness in this very fun and relaxing game.\n\nFor $3 it's an excellent deal.  Thumbs up.  Get it.","February 17","true","1.2"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

Besides this I want to disclose that I got this game pre-release for free for playtesting purposes.\n\nGameplay\nThe puzzle/crafting elements are quite easy to pick up on. At first I was a bit afraid of the type of game since I'm not that big of a fan of puzzlegames. For me as not an avid fan of the genre it's quite easy to pick up on the game and play it. This doesn't mean it's a simple game because the further you get the more challenging the game gets with different 'buddies' and items to craft. I personally haven't finished the game yet because I haven't found the time yet.\n\nLooks & music\nThe game has a really appealing look and style that meshes together well. Everything just seems in place. Besides this the game has quite nice music (all be it a limited amount). As far as I've heard there's 2 main tracks you hear throughout the game which are both really chill and suit the game in my opinion.\n\nSpecifics\nThe game seems to have about 5-8 hours of playtime (in the 'story/campaign'-mode). Besides this you have a challenge mode with different levels. The game also has modding and steamworks opportunities so the playtime could increase through this for people to make their own challenges/levels.\n\nVerdict\nI personally think the game is quite cheap on Steam at the moment and is worth every single penny. I'd recommend getting it.\nBesides all this I can tell from experience (and playtesting) that the game has a very supportive and nice developer. So if you encounter problems in the game, I'm sure that he'll figure out a way to work them out.","February 17","true","4.1"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/recommended/434820/","Dragnix","{FITH}™Dragnix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/","743 products in account","This key was obtained from the developer for review purposes\n\nTarget Audience:  Those wanting to test their mind in a simple yet relaxing environment, while still being ready to flip the table at any moment..\n\nFirst Impressions Video:  https://youtu.be/NxolbNgXEos\n\nSummary:\nA cheap game that delivers. Good core puzzle elements are highlighted by smart choices with the resource management system, restricting things in the right way while not making it overly unberable. It's simple yet will challenge you: as you attempt to figure out what the best way of putting two and two together with the resources you have without sacrificing the happiness of your crafters will be a good exercise: and the game will deliver that “AH HA!” rush when you finally complete it. Now the game does have it's flaws, as some of the UI and screen space could be added to to make them more useful or to use the screen better. It's not a horribly unique game, as the game has been done by games such as March of Industry, but unlilke those, it has the content to back it up and seems a lot more polished all around. It's cute, it's charming, and while it could use a bit more music, it's definitely worth the price of admission.\n\nLists:\nMy Positives:\nGood basic resource management strategy, with enough restrictions to make the player think about their moves, without being too overbearing.\nAllows for the “ah-ha” moments, as you get over that last hurdle to finally complete the puzzle.\nGood amount of content, especially compared to the games of equivalent gameplay, like March of Industry. Good amount or craft recipes, and a 4-6 hour campaign (based on dev comments, and my own experience in terms of the length reached so far). Good value for price.\nSimple aesthetic works in a cute and straight forward kind of way.\nLike the Discard challenges, as they test critical thinking, one of the game's big strengths.\nVery strong options menu for a small game like this. I mean it's a puzzle game, you don't expect it.....and yet it has a ♥♥♥♥ ton of options.\nSecondary control options work rather well for those who want it.\nSeems to have future mod support in the works.\nMy Negatives:\nThose who have some short term memory issues may struggle, as some of the crafting menu navigation and deep crafting layers may get a bit bothersome.\nDo wonder if the random element of material gathering is really good for the game in the long run. Some runs are extended unnecessarily because of that.\nSome screens could use some bigger buttons (main menu screen) and overall needs better use of screen space.\nWould have liked to see a free build mode. Although it may be unlocked after completing the game, so who knows.\nMusic is lacking.","February 17","true","5.0"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","11","15","0","0"

In combination with lady turnips bad mood when destroying items it can elongate some levels substentially.\nModsupport is on the horizon. Hopefully implemented soon.\nFairly long campaign and challenge mode for a good amount of content\nConclusion: A nice test for pointing out some of your short term memory leaks.","February 18","true","1.2"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","8","10","2","0"

Maybe be i will replay once there is a recipe guide out...\n\nFrom the challage mode i can tell there 5 item mix to create some of the items.\n\n130+ different items to use.. 5 buddies to collect.. many challage u can try to compete with other online steam users...\n\nVery simple and basic sound/music effect for this game.\nCartoonish graphics that doesn't look like it too much effect...\n\nMy only problem with the game is the elments mix sometime on't quite make sense.. why is the saw come for X + X? Logically it doesn't always make sense...\n\nAnyhow... would be a fun game to play with your yonge kids and I can only recommend puzzle lover that tolerate basic graphics for this game.\n\nRecommend for 7/10..","February 24","true","4.6"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/siriusoffering/recommended/434820/","siriusoffering","Uncle Sam","http://steamcommunity.com/id/siriusoffering/","1273 products in account","Unexpectedly fun, unexpectedly difficult. This game is well worth its price. It's a puzzle game combined with heavy crafting elements and a slight bit of randomness just to keep you on your toes.\n\nThe gameplay is linear, once you finish a stage the next stage is built upon that, there is a handy craft guide which contains all your previously crafted recipies, and the final goal is easily explained through this book too. The graphics are charming, but there is only one track which is not looping perfectly there are lot of silence in this game other than the sound effects.\n\nYou have to keep in mind a LOT because screw your moves one time and you have to start over again. If you craft the good item at the wrong time you basically have to restart the stage. However, if you plan ahead you will be on the clear.\n\nThere is campaign mode, challenges and all sort of stuff to keep you entertained.","February 18","true","9.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Dificulty is just right, graphics are cute and it place nicely. Also I always apriciate it when developers look for alternatives to rise revenue for thier other games rather than going down unfinished Early Access. Supporting this game is supporting Orkish Inn as well which is only great.","February 18","true","0.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/blarla/recommended/434820/","blarla","Blarla","http://steamcommunity.com/id/blarla/","48 products in account","Brushwood Buddies is crafting and resource management puzzle game that I found to be extremely additive.\n\nI enjoyed the cute style, bobby animation and the plinky, plonky sounds.  The music I also enjoyed but found the long gaps without music made the game feela little cold.  Each time the music started again, I found myself bopping along and helped my flow with the game.\n\nWhen you start the tutorial you are given the impression that you will face very little challenge while playing this game.  However this impression is very misleading.  This game becomes extremely challenging, frustratingly so at times.  I found myself walking away from my PC a few times while filled with salt, however I always returned determined to not have it beat me.  The end boss was the off the scale tricky, but beating him leaves you with immense satisfaction.\n\nFor such a small price you get a lot.  Not only the main story/challenge mode, but also a whole host of quick challenge modes, with leaderboards so you can compare your score to others.  Medals, achievements and even Steam achievements with cards are available. Such good bang for your buck that I purchased a copy for my friend ^^","June 3","true","49.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
