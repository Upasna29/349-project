First impressions are weak indeed, with no keyboard control over the camera (and this being totally essential for even the first mission), and a highly limited soundset(simply put, the engine noise loop is too short and rather grating when it's the only sound in the world).\n\nAfter connecting a 360 Pad to enjoy the controller support (which is indeed global, sufficent to select a level and navigate the limited options) things improved somewhat, the responsive controls very reminiscent of the mobile version. Also reminscent of the mobile version, however, is the very limited draw distance - keeping track of your surroundings when away from buildings is a bit of a challenge, though the authenticity of the minimap is welcome!\n\nI'll curtail this review and give you some basic ups and downs.\n\nUP:\nPhysics are pretty solid and the vehicles feel like the chunky toys they're modeled after.\nStill has some of the charm from the small-screen editions.\nNice, relatively readable UI font (Think of the Wip3out font only you can actually read it).\nCross platform! Any game that runs on Linux is very welcome!\n\nDOWN:\nVery weak and limited sound set.\nLimited fun without a controller.\nSmall selection of levels and no free-play option (nor is there a level editor).\nNo configuration except from the most basic and essential (The stick configuration bent my brain at first, Turning on left-stick steering really helped!)\n360 pad is not really a precise enough controller. I would love to break out the twin joysticks and set the game up to use them, but alas this isn't a supported option.\n\nIn summary:\nI feel like this is still a tech demo, and that it's swinging above it's station somewhat in price. Wait until it's 50% off and I'd say you've got a game that will provide a few hours of entertainment (with the sounds turned off and some music in the background), at least until you've beaten all the levels and had some fun plowing up the biggest clay-ball you can in the dozer.\n\nI wish I could be more middling on my appraisal of the game, so take this to be an "it's okay" review, rather than an outright positive one.","April 27, 2015","true","1.3"," 29 of 38 people (76%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","76","29","38","5","4"

Them slopes are a bit too steep for top-heavy vehicles if you are not careful. But that is all part of the experience as it helps you learn and be aware of heavy machinery dilemas. Also takes a little bit of time to get used to the co-ordination of how the crane arms move around.\n\nPersonally I think this could be tonnes more fun if it was expanded to a multiplayer style of game-world where you could run a server with friends and work together in carving up the landscape. Kinda like a minecraft with bulldozers!","May 6, 2015","true","7.5"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

Once you finish the levels, you can have some fun in the sandbox mode, which is exactly what it sounds like. You are in a box of sand, only unlike most games, you get to move the sand. You have an assortment of vehicles, which is a pickup truck, a flatbed with side guards, a crane on a flatbed, an excavator, and your dozer. They feature full control, which is rotation, elevation, bending, length, and your attachment (bucket or claw). With that, you can make just about whatever you want to in the dirt, such as tunnels and circuits for your pickup truck. Overall, I would recommend this game to a friend, and the price is right for the "budget players".\n\n*fair warning* while moving the dirt, you will lag quite a bit. I average about 30 fps on a laptop, and will get down to 8-12 when moving dirt.\n\nOh, let me edit this to include the developer into the picture. This guy is awesome. He helped me to get this game to run when it did not. He listens to the customers and implements what they want.","May 6, 2015","true","4.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This is not going to knock your socks in terms of graphics. But they are more than adequate, in terms of what this game is. They are pleasant to look at and not trying to be some retro graphical mess either.\n\nSound wise, it's ok. There were some repetitive sounds, like the tracks on vehicles. But not too distracting.\n\nThe levels early on, are easy. But it become more taxing quite early on and are good challenges.\n\nPrice matches the game well and as such, it's worth the price they are asking.\n\nPlatform specific, I am using Linux (Manjaro) with a i7 and mobile GTX765m. Game runs fine, but with a huge amount of dirt pulled up in piles, there can be some lag. Assuming this is a physics issue, there has been an update so we will see. This doesnt mess with the gameplay, so no biggy.\n\nOverall an enjoyable game, I like the sandbox mode. I love the part when I tip my vehicle over and need another vehicle to use the arm and push it back.\n\nIt's worth the price, the developer is active and listens to their customers. Cross platform and works well on the penguin!","May 7, 2015","true","2.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I like how the effects you create on the terrain stay through out the levels, look forward to digging tunnels and building roads up the mountains in sandbox mode.\n\nThe Sky Crane that is depicted just flys in after you clear the heli-pad of dirt. There's no controlling the sky crane if that's what you were thinking.  The sky crane depicted is of the E model Sikorsky 64 that lifts 20,000 lbs. But the sound used is from a Bell 214 (from the inside).\n\nI usually play just cause 2, skyrim, wreckfest, ect., and this game I bought for relaxing and digging my very own dirt-ways through out my open world.  For the same price as a pack of cigarettes, how can you go wrong? Recommended.","May 1, 2015","true","7.4"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

Example you have to hold the bumper bar all the time whilst trying to use the digging function. woud have been much nicer to toggle the digger on and off.\n\nShame about the control issue as I bought it thinking my 3 year old would love it as he is digger mad.\n\nIt is I guess a tablet game rather then PC for example the scenary looks like its in FOG and you cant see very far. In fact you can see it draw the scenary as you drive. If you do to digging the whole thing get laggy and slow and I would say that I dont have a slow PC for this sort of game. GTX 660 and an i3 but like I say the game really should not require this to run smoothly.\n\nI will be honest it steam did refunds then I would be asking for one.","May 1, 2015","false","0.3"," 10 of 25 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","10","25","0","10"

Procedurally generated levels (outside of the main area that is mapped while in a level). Has terrain deformation that lets you dig out the ground. Some will find the controls awkward but I managed fine with a Xbox 360 pad after a little practice & patience, cannot comment on kb&m controls. The developer is active on the forums & helpful which is a big + for it. Worth getting in a sale, its full asking price is abit much as it is lacks a decent number of levels (managed to 100% it in just over 3 hours with some messing around in sandbox), could easily do with another 10+ levels. Hopefully gets much more content added or they develope a new game with the same idea/concepts but ALOT bigger.","June 29, 2015","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While I enjoyed The Little Crane that Could on the Raspberry Pi, I stopped playing this title after a very short time. While the original game was highly structured with clear objectives and fun puzzles, this one's more open map, malleable landscape, multiple vehicles, and less immediately examinable brainteasers just didn't seem to have the same draw. If you can find the original with just the yellow crane, I'd highly recommend that one, though.","December 31, 2015","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
