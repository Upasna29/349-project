What's the angle here? What's the big deal and why do you need to suffer through yet another one? Well, sometimes, those pixels can be just as scary as something "realistic". Sometimes, they just hit just as hard as something as say, Amnesia. Maybe even harder.\n\nSo what does Into The Gloom do?\n\nI can tell you what it did for me. As a gamer who has a handicap? Who suffers from a chronic illness? This hits me a little harder emotionally than it might for other gamers. This is, for me, a truly scary game. While we do have the jump scares (and they do offer you a polite warning before you start the game, yay!), we have a more poignant type of horror being told in this game as well. And it's that squishy type of horror that makes you think and dread the future. It makes you question your life. It makes you question yourself.\n\nYou don't expect a game that hardly clocks in an hour of game play per session to do that to you, but hey! There it is!\n\nIt's not long, but it'll give you the creeps. As you keep playing, more endings and possibilities open up to you. More ways to frighten yourself. More ways to keep thinking...\n\nAnd it's cheap. It's certainly worth that price. You can waste about $2.99 on a quick scares and some self reflection, right?\n\nHandicapped gamers: Beware of jump scares that may trigger neurological issues. They will not flash too brightly, but they are there. Your hands may get tired from the controls. Take breaks. (I'm on one now before I try again). Otherwise this is a pretty accessible game for majority of gamers.\n\nAlready an adored addition to my collection.","April 7, 2015","true","3.3"," 108 of 125 people (86%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","86","108","125","7","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jadarma/recommended/342350/","Jadarma","Jadarma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jadarma/","267 products in account","Note: This game was provided to me for free for review purposes.Overview:Into The Gloom is an exploration horror game where you try to find your place out of a hospital, while finding out who and why you are there. It has all the elements of a good horror game. Spot on sound design, puzzles, documents, and it manages to keep you tense!\n\nThe Pros:Art Style - The game's pixelated graphics may seem like a stupid choice in a horror game, but I was surprised how well it worked. For some reason, the corpses look even creepier, and the voxelized environments make you concentrate more on what's important: gameplay and suspense. The red black and white color scheme is also excelent and works well with the theme. The black fog that gives the game it's name is also great, as you can't see too far and it really makes exploring a little more intense.\n\nMultiple Endings - You can end this game with five different endings. This gives it some degree of replayability, and even a challenge, as some of them are harder to achieve.\n\nScary! - As I've stated before, the game has a very nice scary touch to it. There are some jump scares, but not too many or badly executed. Sometimes, you will see the entities, and have to run for your life, you will hear very errie chants when approaching danger, I love it.The Cons:Short - Despite having multiple endings, the gameplay is rather short, and it is devided in chapters. After your first complete playthrough, you will already know what to do, and there is not story branching in the first chapters, so you will just race through to the exit. Overall you can expect, for your first playthrough, about 3 hours of gameplay, and more if you plan on figuring out all the endings.\n\nMostly Linear - Many of the areas of the map contain story critical items that are put there in order of necessity. You will almost always find an item just before you need it, to make things easier. Also, there are lots of doors that are locked, so you can never wander in the wrong direction. I would have preffered a huge explorable area, even if devioid of useful content, just to make it seem like you get lost, and make you uneasy when exploring.Conclusion:This is an excellent horror game for cheap, with a decent story and unique art style, which really show you just how scary pixels can get when used correctly. Over par suspense and gameplay, along with multiple endings and great price tag make this game easy to decide on!\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more of my recommended games, you can view my reviews here, and be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","September 9, 2015","true","3.6"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","27","31","0","0"

First of all, the atmosphere in this game is phenomenal. The eerie sounds always have me on edge, and even the slightest noise or sudden change becomes terrifying. The puzzles are also well done. None of them are too difficult as long as you don't rush through the game and take your time to find all the clues, but still give you a sense of accomplishment as you complete them.

Levels are pretty short though\n\n-some chase sequences can get a bit frustrating\n\n-somewhat short (1 to 3 hours depending on choices and your skill in solving puzzles)\n\n-a couple typos\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=448185590\n\nI got the game for less than 2$ and I was very impressed with it overall; Into The Gloom really nails down what an horror game is all about, playing it was a tense affair that kept me on edge and the story was very interesting.\nI fully recommend the game, considering it's well crafted and its cheap price this is a much better proposition than other, more famous and/or costly horror games.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/liquinox/recommended/342350/","liquinox","Liquinox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/liquinox/","48 products in account","Excellent game - an exercise in minimalism. This game has better jump scares and MUUUUCH better chases with its hyper-pixelled goofy-pumpkin-headed villain than most horror AAA titles (most of which, yes, suck). The story is kinda goofy, but in a good way. A lot of the game is maze-ish, so you have to get used to the old-fashioned idea that not every door can be opened, and not every area has a "purpose". The puzzles are nicely balanced, the story unfolds in a pretty fun way, and like I mentioned before, the chase sequences are GREAT. It has a TON of charm (I'm a sucker for games made entirely by a single person, and this one did not diappoint) and I am super excited to see what Mr. Ramos has in store next!\n\nAlso, for fun, google '"into the gloom" developer' for an interesting take from Emmanuel on developing a game almost entirely by yourself, and check out the comments section of the Rock Paper Scissors review to see a bunch of old Amiga nerds waxing nostalgic about games that came out before Mr. Ramos was born.\n\nEDIT: Forgot to mention, GREAT sound atmospherics and effects. I'm a developer/video editor by trade myself (not games, yet...), and I have an ancient, wizardly account on FreeSounds. It was heartwarming to see all the FreeSounds credits at the end of the game. As an aside, this is an inspiration to anyone who's ever wanted to make a game. Emmanuel shows that with a budget of $0, as long as you're talented, inspired, clever, and extremely hard-working, you can make something of real quality.","June 30, 2015","true","57.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","1"

I haven''t seen horror quite like this in a long time. The few jumpscares all have build up and actually work quite well, and the atmosphere set up by the low draw distance and the fantastic sound design truly makes me dread going into the next room. The story CAN be a little predictable, but it's told very well and fits nicely into the story in context.\nThe puzzles in this game are hard. Hard as ♥♥♥♥. This isn't Amnesia where you have to flip six switches until you get the right order, no. This is genuine classic survival horror levels of puzzelry that i haven't seen in a long time. And while each puzzle is incredibbly difficult, they all make sense in the end, giving the game a truly classic horror feel.\nThere aren't many action scenes, which is fine with me. The only thing you could consider being action is the occasional chase scene with the Stalker. They're loud and scary and had me running around at the speed of sound crying because holy ♥♥♥♥ he sounds like he's right behind me oh ♥♥♥♥ oh ♥♥♥♥. And that's exactly what horror should feel like. Also the small number of these scenes manages to make you not expect them when they eventually do happen.\nOverall, Into The Gloom is a pixelized horror game that's both NOT youtuber bait AND genuinely scary. Try a Silent Hill level of atmosphere and puzzling, just minus the combat, while also keeping it's own unique identity.\n9/10 bit spooky","June 28, 2015","true","2.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The monochrome and red pallet is a key factor in this. However I really did not like the pixel graphics, I am not one to hold poor graphics against a game but it does feel like it was a conscious decision to make it look a bit pants and it would probably have been improved by a more detailed environment.

The atmosphere is also genuinely well done, with terrific audio, solid music and creepy details that really stand out. I especially enjoyed a level that takes place in a forest that's sparsely populated by a few different buildings, because that kind of setting just gets me. I love forests because you're surrounded on all sides by trees, making it feel oppressive and bleak.\n\nBut then there are the downsides. For one, this game is absolutely loaded with typos, and syntax and grammar errors. Normally I can forgive the occasional typo since, as a writer, I know how hard it is to proof read your own work and catch everything. But there are typos EVERYWHERE in this game, from the text based narration to the scattered notes you find everywhere. It took me out of the game a lot, which is bad for a horror title. The story, what little there is, also feels rather formulaic and that it was written by a teenager (it reminds me a lot of what I used to write in my high school days). In the beginning, there's not much information, then pretty much everything that's going on is explained in a note that is extremely on the nose and feels very out of place (seriously, the note uses the term "by the way" to explain what's going on... by the way is something that should be used in a casual conversation, not in a horror title whose aim is to unsettle the player).\n\nStill, if you love horror like I do this title is worth it, especially if you can find it on sale. The atmosphere is very, very well done and manages to be subtle, which is something sorely lacking in other titles like Outlast. The environments and sound design are particularly well done. Just don't expect much from the story and get ready for all the typos, which, in case you haven't figured it out, are abundant and bothered me to no end.","November 3, 2015","true","2.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

The puzzles\n\nWhile the puzzles in this game are generally well balenced and aren't hard to figure out, there are WAY too many. You will have to solve a puzzle in every single area of the game in order to progress. There isn't anything wrong with something that challenges your mind. But when you're forcing the player to constantly solve puzzles to progress. That really kills the mood and pacing.\n\n2. The save feature\n\nThis game only saves your progress upon entering a new area. Anything you do in that area until you progress to a new one won't be saved. So if you decide to quit whilst solving a puzzle, your progress won't be saved and you'll have to do the puzzle all over again. This can be very annoying.\n\nNow, onto what I liked about the game.\n\n1.) The atmosphere\n\nThe atmosphere in this game is dark, tense, and dreadful. It gives you that feeling of hopelessness, as if there is no way out of this hellhole except in accepting your fate. Or is it?.....\n\n2.) The sound\n\nThe sound design in this game does a really nice job of immersing you into the game's grim story. Everything from the moans and groans the ghosts make to the emotionally stirring soundtrack.\n\n3.) The story\n\nFor the sake of not posting spoilers, I'm not going to dive into the details of the story. But if I had to describe it, it would be like this: It feels predictable at first glance, but the longer you play and learn more. You'll start to realize that there are far bigger things at work here than what you orginally expected. Perhaps even bigger than you.\n\nOverall, if you want an excellent horror tale of ghosts and ghouls, try Into The Gloom. It's a very memorable experience that knows how to keep you hooked into its grim, tragic story.","April 9, 2015","true","2.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Despite being 'trendy' with it's graphics, Into the gloom plays a lot like any generic and boring horror game.\n\nYou are walking in a poorly lit corridor. You try a door, it's jammed. You try another one, its lock is broken. This door won't budge. This door is jammed. You look at notes on the wall. Game says it's just stuff, nothing of interest. You try a door, it's jammed. Another note on the wall, just some stuff. Computers won't work. You see random messages in the wall written in blood. "You will die." "There is no escape." Another jammed door. Linear corridors. Linear sewers. Message in blood. "He is watching." Jammed doors. A person who hanged himself. You will be seeing a lot of those people.\n\nThe actual story of the game is being transmitted to player through random notes. Diary entries. Just stuff, nothing of interest. It is clear that this game is intented to be played through more than once. There are keypads, locked doors, puzzles that you cannot solve during your first walkthrough, but the game won't tell you that. Some of the puzzles feel unfair. A jammed door was actually openable with a key. Who knew.\n\nThe game consists of approximately 6-7 areas. Hospital. Sewer. Prison. Subway. Forest/cemetary. Generic? Just stuff. Nothing of interest. All areas are poorly lit. Random messages written in blood. "You will surely die soon." You will find another notes, that someone tore of their diary and left behind in random places. Jammed doors. Doors that won't budge. Doors that have a broken lock. So many excuses why the doors cannot be opened, and why you must continue this linear passage. Message in blood. Just stuff. Nothing of interest. A hung person. So many people hanging from the ceiling. Did the developer think that the amount of bloody messages and hung people is directly proportional to the amount of horror?\n\nInto the gloom might have been an okay game, but the price is too much. Seriously. There are pixelated horror games that are much more inventive, intuitive and scarier than this one. And they are free.\n\nFor reference:\n\nImScared: A Pixelated Nightmare\nI See You\n\n","July 4, 2015","false","0.8"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Be warned, this review does contain spoilers, so if you're the type who cares for that sort of thing I'd suggest you stop reading.\n\n1. The Graphics\n\nI get it. It's a stylistic design choice. I understand that, I'm not bashing the game for having pixelated graphics. However, when you can't tell where the ♥♥♥♥ you're going because everything is black and white, then you start having problems. BIG problems.  I'd like to think that the developer play-tested this game up and down, so I'd imagine he didn't have much trouble navigating the game. It is a possibility I'm just a blind ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and can't figure out where to go because of it, but hey man it's just way too hard to see ♥♥♥♥. 3/10\n\n\n2. The Gameplay\nInto The Gloom is an atmospheric horror game mostly based around exploration and puzzle-solving, and in both of those departments, it plays quite well. However, you're probably going to want to re-bind the default keys because boy do they suck ABSOLUTE ♥♥♥♥. Z for inventory? Are you ♥♥♥♥ing joking? As far as the puzzle-solving goes, they're challenging. I will admit that I was initially pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at not being able to solve the first puzzle in the game, but after thinking about it I realized I was pretty ♥♥♥♥ing stupid and solved it almost instantaenously. If someone held a gun to my head and told me "Name the best thing about Into The Gloom or I'll end your life," I would definitely say "Oh ♥♥♥♥ it's the ♥♥♥♥ing puzzle solving!!! Don't shoot!! I have kids!!"\n\n8/10\n3. The Story MAJOR SPOILERS\nOh how I loathe the indie scene. Every story-based indie game has to have a stupid ♥♥♥♥ing pretentious story that makes no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sense and tries to challenge your perspective on "how video games should be played!!!" It's complete and utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and, to quote a favorite Youtuber of mine, "reminds me of the pretentiousness of the indie music scene, right down to the corporatization." Into the Gloom takes place in a kids mind while he's in a coma, at least that's what I gathered from the ending I got. And boy does it show up pretty damn quick in this game. So you're just walking around minding your own business, when out of nowhere Giygas from Earthbound shows up (yes I know it's not him but thats who it ♥♥♥♥ing looks like) and your screen turns black. Then you're treated to an incredibly depressing cutscene where the kids life support is turned off and he's dead, and then the developer poses the question "what do you think happens when u die lol" Then it's over. I understand there are multiple endings, but this is the ending I got when I first played. Overall, it left a bad taste in my mouth. ♥♥♥♥ it.\n\n1/10 (probably the worst story i've heard all year)\n\n\nOverall: I'd probably recommend this to the "Gone Home" crowd, it's one of THOSE types of games. Oh well, maybe I just don't get it.\n\nTime to suck my own ♥♥♥♥.\n\n5/10\n","April 7, 2015","false","0.9"," 52 of 132 people (39%) found this review helpful 40 people found this review funny","39","52","132","40","15"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Splain/recommended/342350/","Splain","Splain","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Splain/","85 products in account","Rating: 7/10\n\nInto the Gloom is a pixelated survival horror game with a heavy emphasis on puzzle solving. The game has a very "minecrafty" feel to it and while it is not truly scary it certainly can get your heart racing at times.\n\nAt the start you wake up in a hospital room and then the hunt is on. It is up to you to explore everywhere you can to find keys, valves, passcodes and everything one could expect to hunt for in a horror game. There are even documents scattered throughout the game that provide plot details as well as clue you in on how to solve puzzles.\n\nSpeaking of puzzles, the puzzles in this game are far better than most big budget horror games that have released over the past few years. A few of the puzzles in the game alter your environment as you work to solve them which makes finding the solution all the more satisfying. The harder puzzles may take you between 5 to 10 minutes to solve. (unless you are completely lost on one which can happen).\n\nThe enemies in this game contrast very well with the slow pace of the puzzles. Let me start by saying there are very few enemies, but you will learn to fear them fast. This is not a horror type of fear, but more of a panic type of fear. You can't combat the enemies; you can only run and after one hit it is game over. Oh yeah, an the enemies are fast. It may seem like a cheap death, but again this kind of panic contrasts very well with the slow pace puzzle solving.\n\nThere is a story that unfolds throughout the game, however it felt rather lack luster and is overshadowed by the actual gameplay itself. There are extras you can unlock to fill you in on backstory and also multiple endings to unlock so the game does have replay value. You can expect to finish one full playthrough in 3 hours (if you get the good ending).\n\nTo sum it up: The game has a pixelated artstyle. It has heavy focus on puzzle solving and the game has some delightful puzzles to be solved. The horror aspect of the game is more panic than actual horror. The story is overshadowed by the gameplay and is mediocre at best, but it does add replay value with collectibles to unlock for further information. If you are a fan of puzzle solving or survival horror in general, it is hard to pass this game up for the extremely low cost.\n\n","April 9, 2015","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Die again. Finally make it. Get to final puzzle. Die, die, die, die, die, die, and die. Beat the game, feel obligated to find other endings. Die some more.","July 9, 2015","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a puzzle-style game with an amazing story which can creep you out, with, or without a monster or antagonist. The puzzles in thios game can at times take a fair amount of effort to solve, but they can be done. Now, you may often have to think and work hard to unlock more about the story, but it's worth it because itall makes sense and holds enterest. But there are two pieces of the story that I have not been able to unlock through any means. But it, for the most part, is worth what it costs. ☺.\n","October 1, 2015","true","32.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The pixels didn't bother me at all, but I feel that this game/concept deserves more.","June 2, 2015","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The puzzles were challenging yet had a decent learning curb and the story was actually really interesting, with 5 different endings and some of those endings leaving an opening for a possible sequel.\n\nAfter completing all endings, I highly recommend this game. A really good example of it's genre, the only complaint is that it leaves you wanting more, as all that it does is done well.\n\nPros:\n*Atmosphere - Makes you feel like you're there, it goes from creepy to calm to soothing and back around again with great timing. This is complimented really well with the music, sound effects and visuals.\n*Puzzles - Challenging yet fair (some really challenging), each different with a decent learning curb to them and some 1 or 2 that are quite sneaky.\n*Interesting Story - By interacting with the world and examining things, picking up letters, reaching checkpoints and getting to endings, you put the pieces of the story together and experience it as you're right there in the world itself, this is done really well.\n\nCons\n*Too short - All though the game does what it does really well, and the endings are fine, it leaves you wanting more, and some proper closure, a feeling tha the story could go on.\n* Quite linear - Though it does feel very open at times, you often find that "this door is locked" or "this door is jammed" comes up a lot, even though there are 5 different endings and a point in the game that you can make a major decision that effects the story, it leaves with the idea that there more possiblities that haven't been explored.","February 29","true","16.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Into The Gloom is a really cool horror game with intense sound design and music. It doesn't look like much from the screenshots but in motion, the red/white/black art style looks awesome.\n\nIt's a bit standard with some exploration, puzzles, notes and monters that chase you from time to time but it's all well made. The chase sequences can be a bit tough though. The game also has multiple endings so there's a bit of replay value and for what they're charging I think it's really worth it. I finished it once in 3.0 hours and I got 3 different endings out of 5 I think.\n\nI was really surprised by this one. Liked it a lot.","December 27, 2015","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
