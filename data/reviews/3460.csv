It was still fun, though.\n\nAlthough, once you've seen one screenshot, you've seen them all, so just go look at the screenshots.","October 25, 2015","true","0.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Still, can be frustrating at times, especially if you want a "Solid Gold" run as there's no second chances.","September 16, 2014","true","26.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Everything he touches turns to gold - food, drink, and even his own daughter! Travel back in time and help Midas break his golden curse in this dazzling puzzler. Connect magical talismans to build up wealth and battle legendary monsters from ancient Greece. Power-ups and bonus levels give you the edge you need to twist your way through 80 levels of fun! It is addicting fun and makes you want to come back for more. This is a casual game that really keeps you on your feet. Undo the past and salve the puzzles that come your way to save your daughter and undo the curse that has fallen upon her. Make sure to get this game at a discounted price because there are alot of games out there that can give you casual fun like this but this one has a story to go along with it which is fun as well.","December 2, 2011","true","9.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Easy to learn, "plug & play" but, with increasing difficulty and clear instructions before every new thing to learn. Intense rythm, you are always clicking the mouse, no time to rest. Original, they can be based on anything else but they do their own way and with outstanding imagination. The right difficulty at the right time, to maintain the interest. Variated play modes. Ridiculous simple controls, usually just the mouse and their two buttons, some times the arrows pad is also neeced but, that's all. Very good music and sound effects....\nWell, if you already played Zuma, you know what I mean but, they have other interesting titles and this is one of them.\nHighly recommeded for casual tmes, when you are in a hurry and want to play just a bit or, for that "in between big games" time.\nONE OF THE WEAKESTS BUT, ENSSURED PLAYABILITY.","September 14, 2012","true",""," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"
