The levels are by far the worst thing in this game, they are not built for speedrunning or fluent platforming at all, in fact I think they created a set of levels that were perfect for a game of this type, and then they just inverted them totally to make them this bad, they are just atrocious. Also levels sort of "react" to the music - traps spring up quicker when faster music is playing... trust me it makes things even worse when you are achievement hunting as the ingame playlist is randomised and you can't lock it to a certain track that would actually allow a human being to beat a level in time for an achievement. Another HUGE minus would be that every time you restart a track, there is a stupid unnecessary 3 second long countdown till you get to play.\n\nIf you want an x/10, i'd give it a 4, only because of the decent music, but seriously, if you are looking for games like super meat boy, avoid this.","May 14, 2014","false","7.3"," 196 of 261 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","196","261","0","11"

That’s a shockingly short amount of time to spend on a video game, free or not. And yet, Rush Bros manages to be that rare kind of awful. I honestly think that the developer was actively trying to scare people away from their game. The menu alone is enough indication of that.\n\nLet me break down the basics of just what exactly Rush Bros is for you. You are one of two “Rush Bros”, your goal being to get from one end of a 2D level to the other. So, yes, it’s a platformer. But wait, there’s more! The game’s claim to fame (can we even call it that?) is that your music library (or, if you’re too lazy to actually point the game at your music files like me, the set of techno that comes packaged in) determines the way the levels play out and react. Cool, right? Yeah, that sounds great! I get to listen to my music, and it changes how the game works! Wow!\n\nWell, unfortunately, very wrong. This feature is barely used for anything but a spike or two popping up and out of the floor every few beats, or a lever that needs to be pulled on the beat (a mechanic which, by the way, is very poorly explained). It’s incredibly lame, and it means that Rush Bros is nothing more than a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ platformer with some funky tunes.\n\nNow that we’ve established Rush Bros is completely devoid of originality, let’s talk about the graphics. They’re bad. And I mean really ♥♥♥♥ing bad. Once again, it manages to be that one breed of terrible that not only assaults your eyes with character animations which look to have been haphazardly assembled in flash by a sixth-grader who just figured out how key-framing and looping works, but it also has the audacity to apply filters to the entire image which, after only five minutes, will leave you with a piercing headache. Think Max Payne 3’s most egregious examples of cutscene visual tomfoolery, except constant, always there to taunt your eyes with what could have been clarity instead of a bloom-addled, disco-infused fever dream.\n\nOh, and of course, the controls. Or rather, what controls? This game has controls? Could’ve fooled me, because the first 10 minutes of my time with it was spent trying to figure out why the hell I couldn’t move my character around the screen, at all. Well, as it turns out, unlike most other (well put-together) games, Rush Bros completely ignores the fact that you’ve plugged in a controller when you actually begin playing it (despite the fact it works 100% properly in the menus you use to actually take you to the “play” portion of the game). Yes, you have to manually bind the controller to the actions you want your character to complete despite the fact it tells you right from the get-go “Hey, we made this game for controllers! You should use one!” Well, are you sure you made this game for controllers, XYLA Entertainment? Because from where I stand, that really doesn’t seem to be the case.\n\nOnce you actually get running, it quickly dawns on you that everything about the running, jumping, positioning, and wall-grabbing in this game is completely off. Jumps seem to inconsistently propel you varying distances, movement is so floaty it’s impossibly difficult to land on a jump pad that takes up nearly 20% of the screen real-estate, and the speed at which your character slides down walls when he grabs them will have you wondering if he’s composed of primarily molasses. I cannot tell you how many times in the mere 20 minutes I spent with this steaming turd I died due to the horrific controls.\n\nOh, and don’t even get me started on how hard it is to actually start playing the game in the first place. I still haven’t been able to figure out how any of it works, since when trying to select the singleplayer stages, I kept getting requests to join the games of others. And you know what, I don’t blame those who spammed me with the intrusive offers, either. Hell, I’m sure I did the same, because despite the fact that I’m very obviously trying to play singleplayer through the singleplayer-labelled Arcade menu option, the game seemed to love pairing me up with total randies from the boundless realm of “The Internet”. I’m still not sure if I managed to get into the singleplayer at all, actually, seeing as how every time I finished a stage the game showed me the statistics of an unnamed, invisible second “player” who never seemed able to finish the level before me. Or maybe the game was just unable to identify that I was playing alone, which seems far more plausible.\n\nCredit where credit’s due, the in-game soundtrack (read: not the one you import) is actually pretty good. I enjoyed the techno tunes included, and must admit it’s mostly because of them I even stuck around long enough to get past the first few levels (which are only about 30 seconds each, by the way). However, whatever algorithm the developer is using to apply the “beat” to the in-game geometry is flaky at best, since it always seems to speed-up or slow-down completely at random. Hey guys: if the feature you’ve touted as revolutionary and unbelievably innovative for the platforming scene doesn’t even work with the music you tested and included it with, I think there may be an issue somewhere. But hey, I’m no programmer, so what do I know… right?\n\nTo sum things up, this game is awful. Why I even dedicated a whole 1010 words to it is actually beyond even myself. Stay away from it (not that you honestly ever intended to buy it) and spend that cash elsewhere. I’m just glad I got this smear for free.","May 20, 2014","false","0.9"," 88 of 109 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","88","109","3","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/234490/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Rush Bros attempts to marry the minimalistic, highly difficult platforming of games such as Super Meat Boy and I Want To Be The Guy, with the music generating gameplay of Beat Hazard or Audiosurf while putting a heavy focus on multiplayer. Unfortunately it fails abysmally at being comparable in even one of these aspects, with almost every feature going against the basic concepts it tries to establish, resulting in a game that I could barely force myself to play.\n\nThe problems with the platforming star with the controls. Your character feels as if he's made of putty, plodding along at anything but a rush and sticking to walls like glue. This is a problem firstly because the entire game is based around speedruns which become almost impossible to pull off when movement is akin to running molasses and are you're character is constantly getting stuck on the environment. Secondly, because the level designs haven't been tweaked to compensate for this slowness, with much faster hazards and gaps that are virtually impossible should you miss a speed or double jump powerup.\n\nOn top of being frustrating to navigate, the levels or to be more accurate, tracks are chock full of tedious backtracking which often sends you all the way to the start of the level after you grab a key or open a door. Checkpoints are also a point of contention as there is no rhyme or reason as to their placement or even inclusion. Some tracks feature nearly endless checkpoints before every obstacle, others without a single one to speak of which needless to say vastly changes the difficulty level.\n\nAlthough it's clearly the main focus, Rush Bros manages to somehow be even worse in multiplayer games do to the completely unbalanced powerups that randomly pop up during play. Once again it goes against the core speedrunner mentality, instead resorting to unnecessary gimmicks that cheapen the thrill of winning a match.\n\nThe final aspect is the use of custom soundtracks to change and augment tracks, but it is so inconsequential and often unnoticable that it's hardly worth mentioning. The actual music that is included is of a suitably low quality, and the graphics are incohesive with each background seemingly plucked at random from the user generated reject of other games.\n\nI had high hopes for Rush Bros, and even after playing it feel the concept of a music generated platformer has a lot of potential, but the execution here falls apart with every lazy step it takes. Though it's becoming exceedingly rare for me to play a game where I cannot find even a single redeeming quality to latch onto, but Rush Bros truly does nothing of note and there is no reason I would advise anyone to play it, not even for novelty's sake.","October 2, 2013","false","1.8"," 77 of 98 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","77","98","2","3"

However, aside some neat dance beats and speaker-like pulsating backgrounds it doesn't seem to me like music has ANY influence in the gameplay, whatsoever, as I was expecting something along the lines of Amplitude or Rez (the dawn of the PlayStation 2) -- at least THAT level of interaction.\n\nBut nope. We're stuck with a platformer where you can't trust springs or else you'll likely land on some sharp spikes and I'm sure that if Sonic the Hedgehog were in this game he would sue Xyla Entertainment for character abuse, and most puzzle sections throughout the levels can be pretty long and frustrating -- something that doesn't sound so "fast-paced" after all, let alone played with other people on the interwebs.\n\nOther than the blatant lies we were gently offered by marketing, however, this isn't a game I would consider abysmal after all. In fact, I liked the art style and I think it's pretty neat, something I haven't quite seen in other indie titles (Knytt Underground comes close but it was released AFTER Rush Bros). Not terribly original, but it's surely an upside. ...and that's it, really. I contributed to the game soundtrack as Forgotten Dawn back in the days, it was a good experience, but honestly, I always muted the in-game music. I preferred silence and the lonely game sound effects over the generally ear-shattering OST.\n\nSo overall, this game is pretty subpar compared to other platformers around and it had plenty of potential at hand for becoming a truly engaging musically-driven experience, with or without friends in your lobby.","December 15, 2013","false","2.9"," 56 of 90 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","56","90","0","0"

This precision platformer starring two feuding brothers doesn’t just test your jumping skills, but does so while throwing a ton of bright colors at you and using an awesome soundtrack to make every death seem like a good thing. While you may want to be frustrated as a gamer, as a person, you can’t help but be glad since it lets you listen to more music! It’s a brilliant way to make a game fun at its most challenging moments.Its classification as a racing/platformer may seem a bit confusing at first, but when you play the game, the term makes a lot of sense. Rush Bros. is a time trial-focused game with a side focus on beating stages with as few deaths as possible. Obstacles in your path aren’t just the usual platforms, springs, and spikes, but also things like rock-out stations that require rapid button presses to get through quickly or else you’ll add precious seconds to your time. It’s always tempting to blame poor performance on controls, but they work really well in Rush Bros., so that’s never an issue. Keyboard support is available, but controllers are recommended literally before the title screen hits — so play with one if at all possible. Most importantly for a precision platformer, the controls are responsive. Visually, this is a jaw-dropping game. The sharp color on black outline characters make for a nice contract with the game’s environments, which tend to be bathed in color. Beyond the usual things like space-themed and forest backdrops, there are even some with creepy faces all around them. There’s no sense of sameness with the look of levels, and the  use of little color trails for power-ups only adds to the visual overload.

It is challenging, but far from impossible.\n\nFirst of, this game has a main gimmick: music. You can import your own music into this game or just play one of the music within the game as background music for the stage. The fun thing is that Rush Bros applies your music to the stage. Some obstacles, including spikes and pillars, go along with the beat of your song. That means that it can be used in your advantage or in your disadventage. When you are playing online though, the opponent has his own music, and therefore also his own obstacles.\n\nAs I've said before, Rush Bros is a challenging game. But that is mainly for the achievement hunters or the competitive online players. Whenever you die, you respawn just before the point of death. You have infinite lives, so you don't have to worry about dieing. This also goes for online play.\n\nMe, being a speedrunner, absolutely love the stage designs and eventually reach the goal as fast as possible. I myself do not care much for achievements, but it's a nice aim nonetheless.\n\nHowever, this game is mainly for online play. If you don't have anyone to play with, this game is less fun than it is supposed to be. Also, you might want to use a controller, as it is clearly not made for keyboard use.\n\nRush bros is a fun and entertaining game, but I would advice buying this game when it is on sale. Otherwise, it is not worth it.","January 2, 2014","true","4.6"," 20 of 36 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","20","36","0","0"

But tries too much by using conflicting concepts. The game would be better as two separate games that only use the concepts that support each other together. Because it tries to be a speedrunner where you can run against each other or alone against time. But also have different styles of level designs almost each level. Most levels you need to backtrack for keys. That's fine but not when you're speed running. The randomness of the level reacting on the music is also goes against the speedrunning. And you have some trail and error dead traps in the level design.\n\nThe controls feel a bit off in the beginning and I think it's because of the stickiness when you wallslide. In most games where you can walljump the wallslide is fast but here it's really slow. And it's counter intuitive to the speed running. It's really annoying and I don't get why they made it like this.\n\nI really want this game to live up to it's potential. The music is great and the art style is pretty cool. It just isn't working as a speed running game. If you just play too casually complete the levels it's fine. But the whole racing against each other and time just doesn't work for this game because the developers wanted too much. It could have been an amazing platformer like Super Meat Boy or Electric Super Joy.","January 17, 2014","false","1.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It often tries to tote itself as a precision platformer but fails to deliver on adequate platforming. The jumping feels awkwardly clunky and more often than not you will end up falling because it doesn't recognise input for more than 100ms which is unacceptable. The game falls off and the level design is interesting but the platforming mechanics feel weighted and not precise at all. My biggest gripe with the game is that it often tried to get me to play against other players in a race before I have even played a level, I would toggle off this option and immediately after a race it would re-enable it; If I wanted to play multiplayer I would have chosen that option from the main menu.\n\nPros\nInteresting level design\nBeautiful backdrops\n\nCons\nMusic is annoyingly intrusive\nClunky platforming\nAnnoyingly integrated versus\nArt that resonates with music felt off beat and distracting\n\n\nThe game has interesting ideas but fails to execute effectively and in a way that isn't frustrating for the player. The seamless multiplayer is nice but its lack of remembering when I had toggled it off quickly became annoying. I found myself muting the game to not have to listen to the music. The game was interesting but there have been plenty of game available for cheaper (even free) that I would avoid this and look for something else.\n\nI would have to rate the game a 3/10","May 18, 2014","false","1.5"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

We're trying to do everything we can to make Rush Bros. known. It's a hard-core racing game which can be enjoyed by both casual players and dedicated speed-runners. The philosophy behind the game is: Play the way you want to. When you're on a playground you don't normally declare the rules before everyone jumps in a sandbox. By the time you get there somebody is probably already making sande castles. Then somebody screams "The Floor is Lava" and things get really interesting. Rush Bros. is themed around this kind of play- this more organic make-up-the-rules-as-you-go-along kind of play. This is a hard concept for some people to understand because it's something more natural / organic and less structured. If anything else Rush Bros. is an experiment with how you can allow your players to design the rules for how the game is played while they are playing it. You choose what levels to play on, you choose the win condition (Cross Finish Line Together Vs. There's One Obvious Winner - Or some other condition based on applied Remixes / Mutators ). On top of all this we've also got some great music dedicated by fans as well as some awesome bands like Infected Mushroom, Xilent, Matt Larsen, and many others. I strongly suggest you give it a try! If you're in to speed-running then this is really your cup of tea, trust me.","July 14, 2013","true","187.8"," 28 of 52 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","28","52","0","5"

A cup of ice cream would have been a lot more fun for the money.\nNow to the real review (I've been even using the Co-Op Mode): The game is fast and dynamic, in the first few seconds it's awesome, but soon the first flaws appear:\n- Why do they have a running animation, when you can spam the slide and are a lot faster? Keep that away, it looks like you're glitching, but if you're not doing it, you know that you should do it or you'll lose.\n- The game and level design is awful. Flash games look better and are for free. And you can't really tell if an obsticle is just there or if it is deadly. Maybe it is the color, but everything is glowing and so I didn't care and got kinda frustrated. And if you play coop and "kill" your friend....oh god the animations look so horrible.\n- There's no aim. You have all songs and all levels (or am I wrong? But starting with over 30 levels doesn't seem too unlockable) and therefore I don't know for what I'm playing. Me and my friend were battling and the winner got...nothing. We started the next level, had a bit fun, but it got boring soooo fast. Now you're asking "but there are achievements which save us!" Wrong. "Beat XX in YY seconds." that's it. For every level. Yay.\n- The level design isn't fun. In games like VVVVVV or Super Meat Boy (which I have both beaten with a sh*tload of fun) everything was hard, but fair or fun. In RB you run, fly or fall into something and ask "WHY? WOW IS THIS SUPPOSED TO BE FUN". My friend isn't a noob either and had the same questions.\n- The music is meh. I'm totally into EDM and it's the most common thing I hear, but in the game I liked about 2 songs (one was the main theme). After using my songs (which took an eternity to load, my friend dealt with the same issue) the levels didn't change that much, so no "wow" in this either.\n\nAfter all, this game is so disappointing, even for paying only 1€.","July 17, 2014","false","1.5"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","1"

The idea of a platformer that you play to your music sounds good on paper, but I feel that Rush Bros. doesn't deliver on it's cool-sounding concept. If a game has the option to play with my music more often than not I will choose to do so. In Rush Bros. however, unless you're playing anything other than electro house you're probably going to have a hard time moving through a level since obstacles will either focus on A) the back beat B) the vocals or C) some other element to the song that isn't made readily apparent to you. This results in either trying the level with a different song or the default music (which works fine, btw) and I feel that's very poor design on the developer's part. Speaking of poor design, some of the levels in this game are just terrible. This game excells when you're going fast and dodging obstacles and there are quite a few levels where you are put in a maze and have to find keys to progress almost in a puzzle-platform kinda way. Being forced to slow down and think your way through a level wouldn't be so bad if the wall jumping didn't feel as sticky as it does, which sucks since in the puzzle levels there are tons of walls for you to stick to for whatever reason.

Characters aren't very quick, and lose all speed immediately upon touching any wall surface, as they were made out of glue. The sticky nature of wall interaction probably hinders platforming more than it helps with walljumps. Rush Bros seems confused at what it wants to do, putting walljump training wheels in a title that seems to want people to compete at platforming skills.\n\nThe game also is very bad about giving you information. The "tutorial" level has none of it, leaving me confused and stuck at some point trying to figure out what the game wanted me to do but wasn't going to tell me. I received multiple "challenge" notifications from random players on the tutorial stage which certainly was adding to the confusion. Levels can be confusing and hard to navigate the first time about, with some having you run deep into death traps before realizing you need a key from some obscure branch in the level, or just letting you figure out that there are no more paths available to progress and the end of the level is actually in the beginning.\n\nThe music-driven part is honestly such a non-factor that I almost forgot about it. I suppose it could affect your timing based on track played, but is that really a good thing? I don't think so.\n\nMemorizing levels seems to be more rewarding than competent platforming in Rush Bros, and memorizing levels for the short minute-or-so experience is just never going to be rewarding enough.","February 24, 2014","false","1.3"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

It tries to combine platforming, music/rhythm games, and head-to-head racing. Unfortunately the attempts at each of these individual parts are deeply and fundamentally flawed, and are not designed in such a way to meld together properly. Running and jumping does not feel fun (and we could stop there since that is all you do), racing against the clock or a friend are fundamentally the same thing due to extremely poor level design that relies on memorization, and the musical aspects of the game are almost entirely non-existent. Background images and certain obstacles might jive a little bit with the drums and bass of a track, but ultimately the music, whether it's from the included soundtrack or your own library, has no significant effect on gameplay. So if there's no rhythmic response and the racing aspect is not there, what you're really left with is just a very subpar platforming game. This is such an easy impulse buy but it is just terribly unfun and disappointing.","March 11, 2014","false","2.1"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","1"

Precise controls, level consistency, and a feeling of fairness all elude this game and that makes it impossible recommend.\n\nThe game's gimmick is that parts of the level move with the beat of the current music track playing.  It's an interesting idea but one that shouldn't have gone past the prototyping phrase, where it should have been discovered how badly it works out in practice.  This includes traps and not every object responds to every beat, which when mixed together with the sub-par beat detection makes this movement almost impossible to accurately predict.  This also causes certain songs to make certain levels ridiculously hard, if not impossible.  A few of the later levels take this mechanic to such extremes, I firmly believe that they are some of the worst levels ever included in any game.\n\nThe other main issue with the level design is invisible traps.  Pretty much every level has spikes, but some of them in some levels will shoot at you when you get close.  There's no way to tell which ones will do this.  Spikes will even shoot at you from off screen with no warning.  What this unfortunately results in is rather than skill-based platforming, you simply have to memorize the levels to do well.  That's not real difficulty, it's poor design.\n\nThese problems combined with sloppy controls can make this game very frustrating and it's not hard to see why over 90% of the reviews are negative.  While I did enjoy the music the game has to offer, it would be better to save your sanity and pass on this one.","May 24, 2014","false","9.2"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","2"

Eugh.\n\nI saw this game when it was on sale for abou 2.49 on the store and it looked pretty damn cool. The graphics were flashy, the music was authenitc, and if you didnt like it, you could even add your own custom soundtrack! The gameplay looked fast paced, and it looked really fun.\n\n.......Until i played the damn thing.\n\nThe gameplay is really slow and and you're not going to get to pick up the pace unless you spam the roll technique. And while that is sometimes expected, it really lowered my expectations for fast-paced and fun gameplay.\n\nAnd while the graphics ARE flashy, yet a bit easy on the eyes, they're a bit TOO flashy. Its really hard to focus on one thing, then move your eyes to focus on another with all of the detail this game has to offer, and I feel like they tried way too hard and ended up overdoing it. I'm not saying its eyestrain or that it is'nt pretty to look at, but it slows down the gameplay even further when you cant even focus on moving from one place to another.\n\nThe only thing I liked about this game is the amount of customization and free-roaming time you have. Like I said, you can make your own soundtrack and even change the color of your character which lowers the amount of bad restriction this game forces you to deal with. And, prove me if i'm wrong, since i uninstalled this game, but i think you can make your own levels. And you can even invite friends and go against eachother for bragging rights, I like that in a game, but not with this kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gameplay.\n\nIf you're the slow type who likes flashy-in your face graphics, your opinions on this game just might differ from mine.

A wonderful idea, with the controls meeting that idea creating a fast-paced good time, whether you are alone or with friends. I can wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone.","September 24, 2014","true","26.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The game itself isn't for anyone and if you're planning on buying it, wait until its $5 or less as the $10 price tag is too much for this game.\n\nThe game itself is exactly as it claims it is when it states that it's "a music reactive Platform Racing Game". The game itself is centered around competing against other players online (or against your own times) while avoiding obstacles that are  Somewhat reactive to the music. But this "reactive" element is where part of the problem I have with this game arises. Depending on the song currently playing, certain elements of levels can be virtually impossible to complete. As songs get more and more upbeat obstacles seem more aggressive and unpredictable. Be it those strange "bass" obstacles that send you flying away from them, the pulsing buzz saws, or those obnoxious cannon like things, certain songs will make these obstacles about a million times more difficult. I myself would often find myself waiting for the brief moments of peace at the end of one song while another was preparing to start before trying to quickly rush through an obstacle I'd been stuck at for what seems like ages.\n\nNext up, level design. While all the stages themselves are unique and different, there's a few major problems I've noticed in levels that just makes the game itself incredibly frustrating to play sometimes. On some levels you'll get a checkpoint nearly every 20 feet, so a death is meaningless and can cost you only a few seconds, while on other levels I felt like I'd spend a minute at a time avoiding obstacles only to die and be sent right back... And that without mentioning some horrible level layouts where I could miss a jump, fall down for about 15 seconds and land on a platform near the beginning of the level, forcing me to start almost the entire race over again.\n\nMultiplayer itself seems to work well enough, however I haven't been able to play much online. Half the time I can't find a server with anyone to play against, and whenever I can, they'll often leave before we can even pick a level or make it any significant distance into a race. However racing against a friend while chatting over skype can be a blast.\n\nOverall the game itself isn't bad... but I wouldn't by any means call it great or even necessarily good. It's a basic platformer, with controls that can be a little bit slippery, beautiful background images, and a diverse and enjoyable soundtrack. While I wouldn't necessarily recommend the game at full price unless you're really really itching to get your hands on it, I would recommend it if it drops to $5 or below. And at that point you may want to grab a 2-pack so you could send a copy to a friend if you ever wanna play a quick game to pass some time.\n","December 21, 2014","true","17.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

This ruins the speed and rhythm of the game. If the track deigns to, you'll be stuck behind an obstacle. Most obnoxious are the spike traps that block your path and move up and down, which again, "move to the beat", so even if you wait for the specific moment it switches between up and down, and try to go under/over it, "the beat" might still decide to change it again and squash you.\n\nThe controller often stops working when you open the start menu, which is annoying, as you'll be restarting levels over and over because the achievements are horribly unforgiving and one or two deaths is too many.\n\nWhen racing your ghost(not optional) the camera will change focus slightly away from your character so you can watch your ghost. I don't see why you'd ever want to watch your ghost. The music will probably be different, so the level won't be the same, so things your ghost didn't have to deal with will smack you right in the face.","May 15, 2014","false","6.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The music was decent and I ended up getting a few of the tunes stuck in my head. The music also had some surpising variety to it, not a lot, but the fact that it was there was a pleasent surprise. The musical elements of this game take a back seat with only hazards pulsating to the beat, even then its hard to follow the pattern of music and try to listen when they'll trigger, making them feel more tacked on than part of the level. The best part of muscial incorporation are some of the genuinely interesting backgrounds as they pulse along with whatever the beat it, it adds to the visuals but doesnt annoy like some of the hazards can.\n\nThe controls feel solid and works well on both a controller and keyboard. The multiplayer is still surprisingly active, and is handled quite smartly. When playing you can choose to accept challenges and continue playing single player, once another player is found it will ask if you want to race against them. More games should make use of this and due away with having to wait in a lobby. It has split screen which is amazing, this is a dying feature and I always appreciate the option when included.\n\nThere are 47 levels currently total each taking about 5 minutes on average after counting deaths on some of the harder ones.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ChuckNorrisTypeR/recommended/234490/","ChuckNorrisTypeR","LL Playcool","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ChuckNorrisTypeR/","296 products in account","TRIAL AND ERROR\n\nIn a sea of indie platformers that are the product of days spent basking in the glow of CRT televisions and arcade cabinets; one emerges, dropping the beat on you with more force than Skrillex could ever wish to conjure.  Rush Bros uses it's rather Dubstep heavy soundtrack, or your music, to bring life to its obstacles. Fans of games such as Amplitude or Frequency may dig the notion, though I'm not sure this iteration has sold me on these concepts by way of platformer.\n\nRush Bros controls well, allowing players to wall jump, and slide, with collectable power-ups for speed and double jumping. At its core I think rush brothers could be a good platforming experience, with ideas pulling from recent indies such as Dustforce and Super Meat Boy, with a musical twist and an identity crisis. The art style makes use of dark blacks and neon lights that can be seen in a number of rhythm games. Although fans watching videos of preview builds will be glad to know that the art has been much improved since.\n\nThe level design, on the other hand is wherein my issues lie. While touting the moniker "Racing Platformer" amongst a myriad of marketing materials, levels can be very tedious. Platformers can really strive when you find a level's pulse and the inherit rhythm of good design. Tapping into your music to alter the pulse is a great idea, though every time I entered that sweet spot, I would crash and burn into a wall of over complication.\n\nIt seems like many of the levels require you to back track, to progress further, this in itself is pretty disrupting when you are racing.  While subtle changes do occur, they don't seem to follow any consistent beat, it was hard to tell if each pattern was solely based on the song's BPM, (beats per minute) or on the music. This can lead to some unpredictable obstacles that can contradict the music they are getting direction from. It's not rare for the harder levels to take up to thirty minutes on your first run, though I suppose this may count as an endurance race.\n\nRush Bros does offer a nice simultaneous multi-player experince, as well as drop-in multi-player, adding a bit more depth than a leader board. Fortunately the drop-in feature can be disabled, it's nice to have, though it can be frustrating racing someone before you have memorized the complexities of each level. I applaud adding a bit more competition than a high score or target time to chase.\n\nFINAL VERDICT\n\nMasochistic joystick junkies may come to rejoice at the feet of Rush Bros, though I felt the game struggles with its identity. When I think of a rhythm based racing game, I would assume simplistic design based primarily on the flow of game play. Simple to learn, hard to master is a great strategy for platformers though I did not find it in Rush Bros. Although fans of complex platforming with an affinity for Dubstep may find it to be the perfect game.\n\nYou can view the original review  here [www.pixelsforbreakfast.net]\n\nYou can also view my website  Here [www.jamesabels.net]","February 10, 2014","false","1.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Playing through the levels makes me think of a Tron-themed Super Meat Boy, except sometimes the obstacles and so forth are extremely unforgiving (forcing you to completely restart the level if you don't get past). I like challenge, but there is such a thing as too much.\n\nThe "music based" part is where the game disappoints me, however. Not because of the soundtrack - the game ships with some incredible music, and even has native support for your MP3s if you decide you don't like what it comes with. The problem however, is in the way the game uses the music; or to put it more accurately, how it doesn't. Occasionally there will be little blinky lights or pulsing disc things that will react to the beat, but nothing seems to react to the music in a way that actually effects the gameplay itself. I don't go faster with higher tempos, the obstacles just travel along the same timing patterns...I could load a slow, sad Sinatra song and get the same game as a high tempo Pendulum track.\n\nIf you can pick it up as a freebie somewhere, go ahead, but don't drop $10 on it unless you're incredibly rich.","May 28, 2014","false","1.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

My only negative experiences have been with low player base and the fact that with the exception of 1 person (who left after 2 loses) the majority of racers you find in this game are unable to take losing, and most races end with your opponent quitting.\n\nOverall, it's much simpler platforming than something like Super Meat Boy; not to detract from its difficulty at all, it's plenty hard, but the races weren't meant to stop someone in their tracks forever. Which is part of the problem, players who are inexperienced tend to quit before they have a chance to learn to play. It's a game you have to get good, but the game is set up in a discouraging way.\n\nI'd say with some basic interface modifications, some updates to multiplayer features, and a couple tweaks to the camera (which irrationally zoomed to a location that my player wasn't in a couple times) this could be a game that has a strong community for multiplayer, and see's its multiplayer population skyrocket. I enjoy it, but I've hit a player cap after only an hour and a half of practice. 15 games in a row disconnected or cancelled before they even started. What's sad is that it's like players don't know they can decline the song and pick something else; and I would have accepted it 100% of the time.\n\nPotentially a 7/10 depending on how much you enjoy racing your own shadow if you don't have a friends list filled with Rush Bros. players.","June 17, 2014","true","4.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I do read those things to have an idea of the game, but I still like to give a chance to every game, mainly if it's an indie one. But this one is disappointing... I don't usually make negative reviews, because I know how troublesome it is to make even a small game, but if you want a piece of advice, then go waste your money on something else.\n\nThis game is nothing like promised, the stage doesn't respond very well to the songs, only a SMALL portion of it (spikes, some platforms that pops from the ground and crates that will "smash" you or whatever those things are) will move with the song and some of the objects that are affected will move totally out of the rhythm of a custom music and the gameplay is slow and boring. If you want to get some speed, you need to keep smashing the "slide" button or put your hands on a "Speed-Up" powerup. Seriously, multiplayer racing platformer? If you want to race a friend in a 2D platformer, go play Sonic the Hedgehog 2 or 3. In the other hand, it's a great game if you're having trouble to sleep. Surely you will feel sleepy in about 2 seconds.\n\nHas a good soundtrack, though. Still, not worth the price.\n\nThe only good thing I got from this one was the 100XP from the badge.\n\nToo bad a game chosen by the Greenlight, with an incredible concept, turned out to be so boring, so badly executed...\n\n2/10, because of the songs.","June 19, 2014","false","4.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is a rhythm platforming game where an algorithm determines the pacing of traps and projectiles based on the beat of a song. Unfortunately the developers have chosen to make the soundtrack a variable, meaning that every person who plays the same level will be met with a different experience and, more importantly, a different level of difficulty.\n\nThe level design often betrays itself and the player; where a certain coloured platform may be safe to stand on, another platform of the same colour will instantly kill the player. Similarly, traps may fly across the screen and kill the player in a manner you never would have expected. Nothing is ever clearly explained or defined before the player encounters an obstacle, which means you'll often have to play through a level multiple times before understanding how it actually works. It's a level of artificial difficulty created by the developer as more of a joke on the player rather than competent game design.","May 17, 2014","false","1.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

There should be more friend vs friend games like this.\n\nPS the music is cool.\n","March 14, 2014","true","4.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

After playing the game for 116 minutes, several flaws in the games are apparent.\n\nRestarting the level becomes tedious because there is no key that just restarts the level. You have to press escape and click on restart and the yes button. This might seem minor, but when making a mistake over and over you could be restarting the game about 20 to 50 times trying to get a better time. Then comes the three second wait every time you restart, there seems to be no reason for this at all.\n\nThere is no way to view the level so it is all trial and error. You spend minutes memorizing levels and having to react very fast and if you don't you have to restart. And restart. And restart. The level is constantly different due to the music and you can't lock a level to a single song. So after memorizing the level you still have to adapt because the beats of the song change the objects movements.\n\nThere are a few bugs in the game such as warping through walls or objects. Some objects that are moving that kill you leave a hurtbox that should not be there and unfortunately you walk into nothing and die.\n\nLeaderboards is meaningless due to all the glitched scores. Some people have beaten a lot of the levels in 0.0 seconds making it all pointless.","June 10, 2014","false","1.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

The 40+ levels are always the same, no matter which track plays in the background. The extent of the music’s influence is how or how fast certain obstacles move. So, not exactly ‘Audiosurf’-level music immersion, really.\n\nOn the other hand, if you’re looking for a difficult platformer with a decent soundtrack, ‘Rush Bros.’ could be the game for you. The only other gripe I have with the game is how the character animations aren’t exactly… well, animations -- which makes moving through the levels feel not exactly fluid.\nBut its local as well as internet multi-player should make up for that if you’re looking for a little competition.","August 30, 2013","true","1.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

It's honestly quite a mess from start to finish. I mean, zombies are shoe-horned in for no reason whatsoever, so that should give some indication.\n\nThe levels are about as "affected by your music" as Turba is. But at least in Turba when a song gets fast, the game does too. Supposedly the traps change speed, but it honestly just make them look like they were programmed by a drunk guy. Speaking of drunken programming, the music selection system is the worse thing I have ever seen in my life. There is no way to choose just 1 song. You create "playlists" out of entire folders. So if you're a normal human being and have just 1 folder for music, it selects your entire library recursively, with no way to easily remove or add in tracks. You also can't reorder or select tracks for play easily at all. For whatever reason, you can also change your music track in the middle of a game, if you can get the music controller to show up. The biggest kicker by far is that turning on shuffle affects the "previous track" button, making it painfully obvious this was just a mediocre platformer and they just tossed in the music as an after thought. The default music is generic techno rubbish. It's so generic I couldn't even tell if the game was stuck on a track or not while playing.\n\nThe platforming aspect is bad as well. They make you backtrack (in a fast-paced platformer...) as soon as level 2. The level design is confusing and you actually end up getting lost your first time through even though there are signs telling you where to go. They just put doors and such in locations that you easily overlook. Level design also repeats fairly often, as if it were made with a random level generator. Some parts of the design are just horrid. There's one section where there are a bunch of springs you have to get past, except it's next to impossible to get past them without being flung back. The levers you have to pull force you to spam a button instead of pushing it once like any other sane platformer. You can get double jump and speed up powerups, but they are useless 99% of the time.\n\nOverall, this is just terrible. In the only highly rated positive review, (by the developer no less) it touts one of the key features is "you choose the levels". Perhaps this is one of the few features that actually work (incidentally I had to spend 5 minutes trying to figure out how to start a level because there is no "Play" button, so maybe not). The EULA is also so insane it would make Square-Enix overjoyed. It is honestly just a platformer with a music player shoved in. Platform Racing 2 is far better in every way (including music selection) and that was a free flash game from 2008.","August 9, 2014","false","1.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I think this game was trying to be a game like Meat Boy, I Wanna Be the Guy, etc. etc. Same concept, same difficulty. 3/5\n\n3 . Music:\nOk, let's get serious... CHECK THIS ♥♥♥♥IN' ♥♥♥♥ OUT! This game was based souly on music, and they nailed it out of the park! It's badass, and you play the to the beat sometimes. I find myself playing this game just cause of the music. I love it so much, on so many levels! 5/5\n\n4. Level design:\nRazors, walls, spikes, and colors are EVERYWHERE! I find myself getting stuck on while playing this game and it fustrating a lot. But kinda good over all. 3/5\n\n5. The game:\nFun, fustrating, and dubstep (techno too) being made by mostly one person, it's a good game. I would rather play it over some games. OVER ALL RATING! 6/10\n\n\n","January 19, 2014","true","2.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Think twice before rating or giving out a comment...\nRush Bros. hmm, what can I say about Rush Bros.\n\nEither the developers who are developing/developed Speedrunners got bored and opened up a new company and made a crappy version of their great game, or a developer felt like creating a game like Speedrunners and make music about it. Dunno, you can decide...\n\nSo first, the controls... they are the worst control schemes I have ever seen (on keyboard) as far as I know, platformer games use the arrow keys to move, and x/z key to jump. Then why on earth did the people at XYLA Entertainment think it was great to make the controls WASD and the Spacebar, my fingers are apart and for a platformer it is extremely uncomfortable, let's see what else is bad in this "game"\n\nOh yeah! THE LEVEL DESIGN, who on earth created these levels!?! They are either extremely easy or near impossible, someone must of been bored and felt like making the levels all confused and jumbled up. Great work! (He says sarcastically)\n\nHmm, oh yeah, the animation, looks... ugly. Now normally I love Indie games, and I don't really complain about the graphics in great Indie games, but this "Indie" game, the animations and quality and also the presentation on the game looks ugly and not very professional\n\nOk... what's next. OH YES, the multiplayer. The multiplayer... is a bag of dung mostly. Either the people who are playing with me have very bad internet and lag all the time, or I start playing and the other player couldn't give a toss and just stays their or the person who is about to play with me probably has brains and doesn't play this game.\n\nBut... ThePCGamer101, you might ask, isn't their something good in this game, after all, you did buy this game didn't you?\nNo, I actually was stupid enough to get it from GreenManGaming (they were giving it away, because probably people never bought it)\n\nThe only good thing I say that is good in this game is that the game can actually play music from your personal libraries, which is kinda cool listening to great music while trying to play this disaster of a game\n\nOverall, this game is a mess, not a terrible mess, but it is not a great nor good game. If you get the game for free or something like that, play it for a while, then get bored, and as you can probably see from my playtime (15 minutes or so) I got bored REALLY quickly\n\nNOT RECOMMENDED :(  Best to play with a controller, if you can","June 20, 2014","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can play as 4 DJs and a zombie, but no more difference than the aesthetics of each other. Rush Bros has no plot, but that highlights its quick game style and I like it that way.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nRush Bros is all about the music, the enemies and traps attack along to the beat of the music, and the stage too shines along it.\nFor a fast-paced 2D platformer, Rush Bros isn't breaking new ground, however, it remains true to his style, returning to the formula of a platformer against the clock, and it couldn't do it better.\nThe game has all the levels unlocked right at the begining, and there's no unlockables, so the only thing the only thing that makes you keep playing are the achievements. It's short and there's no motivation to keep playing after you beat it, which you can easily do in 10~15 hours (assuming you played all levels before going for the achievements).\n\nThe controls are very responsive. You can jump, wall jump, slide and get power ups to get a better time, it has the typical obstacles; spikes, lasers, moving platforms, and a really nice touch to add in the versus side of the game are player-activated traps that you can use agains other players; there's nothing more hilarious than flip the controls of your friend and ruin his best time.\n\nThere's something to point out, the game has a lack of speed, don't get me wrong, the game move fast, but the animation of the characters DOES NOT fit with it, the sense of speed is just not there.\n\nART DESIGN, MUSIC, AND AESTHETICS:\nDo I need to tell how wonderful this game Is? THE ART, THE LEVEL DESIGN, THE ATMOSPHERE, everything in this game look gorgeous. And the music, OH BOY THE MUSIC, this soundtrack is a masterpiece, it fits right in, BUT WAIT ¿You don't like the soundtrack? Don't worry little buddy, you can import your music into the game. This feature is one of the best in the game, because as I said, the level behaviour depends on the music. If you're a hardcore player, try to play with rock music.\n\nSYNTHESIS:\nFor 10 dollars you're getting a great game, It is short of course, but its worth the money. I recommend you to play it online with friends, you will have a better experience.\n\nTo me, Rush Bros gets a 7/10.\n-Good work XYLA, keep going.","December 16, 2014","true","20.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not to mention the respawns are just plain stupid when it requires you to restart all the way back. (this includes all unpredictable traps respawn).\n\nThe game tries to make a electronic theme super meat boy, but just fails at it. The music is awesome, and custom playlist is something im a sucker for, but everything about this game is just so unfinsihed or just plain impossible to play. Really, the only thing this game really has it's CO-OP mode.\n\nAnd to top it all off, this game is priced a $10! I suggest waiting this sale for this game to be 2.99","August 12, 2014","false","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Considering that you have time only to hear the starting chords of the song before the level is over and that next time you hear the start of a different song - it becomes increasingly annoying.\n\nI would've seen playing this game at a party were quick action and short levels are perfect to keep the guests entertained without taking too much attention span away if only the controls were not broken and the music was more continuous (just keep playing the song through the countdown and level load so that there is a connected experience)\n\nAnyhow, even with the controls and music intact, the amount of entertainment that this game would provide is maaaybe worth $5. But even for $2, considering that it does have bugs is a stretch and I would have to think about it.\n\nP.S.: the video options are also broken - if you change more than 1 setting at a time, then there is a chance that some of your changes will not get applied. Navigating the menu after playing with my controller, somehow becomes impossible using the d-pad or the keyboard arrows, and after hovering over a menu item get the sound for a dozen or even more of selection change events.

When it was in greenlight, I was excited, but only because I misunderstood. I thought it would be like Audiosurf and it makes custom levels with your music. Nope. Blocks will pop of faster if your music is fast! Such wow! Amazing! This is 21st century technology here! I might as well play a half-decent platformer and put on iTunes or go into Big Picture and do the Steam music feature to have a better time than this. There is also no story. I want to know the story between these 2 'D-J's-'! I got this with playfire and it wasn't even worth the price of free! Levels are very repetative. Jump. Jump. Die. Jump. (and the occasional) Slide. That's it! The achievments seem imposible too. HOW CAN YOU NOT DIE ON THE FIRST LEVEL IF YOU NEED TO GET TRAPPED IN A ROOM FULL OF SPIKES TO COMPLETE THE LEVEL???!!\n*UPDATE 6/14/14* There is a way to not die in the 1st level and it is extremly hard to get it. When I go on music longer than 3 minutes, my game freezes up for a few seconds and plays the song. It's not even worth that wait! You can only listen to about 1 minute of the song! Then when you go to the next level, it won't take you to the place where you left off, IT WILL TAKE YOU TO THE SONG BEFORE IT!!! I don't want to listen to their techno crap thing. I listen to metal. It claims everything will be fast paced if you play a fast paced song. I played War Ensemble by Slayer. It took forever to load. Everything seemed about as fast as a really old and simple song. I still do not recommend this game and probably never will unless they fix anything.

Otherwise a worse-than-average platformer.\n\nFull Review:\n- Gameplay\nThe game and level design is awful. It is a simple platformer with constantly flashing lights that do no part to make the game look nice and your friends don't here what music you are playing. If anything, the music is just what you play in the background. You don't jump, dodge or do anything that is related to the music, fully contrary to what it claims “Discover gameplay with custom music” . There's nothing to customise at all.\n\n- Controls\nThe controls are also simple but really plain because of the poor execution. You find yourself trying hard to jump, run, dodge, not because it is difficult, but because the game mechanis are just off. You respawn next to the obstacle which continues to run even when you die, so you are essentially waiting for the right moment to jump -- and even then, it doesn't feel fun doing that. It is not tense at all. It is boring jumps and runs all the way.\n\n- Verdict\nI am glad I got it for free. It was a waste of time to even install it.","December 19, 2014","false","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When it was in greenlight, I was excited, but only because I misunderstood. I thought it would be like Audiosurf and it makes custom levels with your music. Nope. Blocks will pop of faster if your music is fast! Such wow! Amazing! This is 21st century technology here! I might as well play a half-decent platformer and put on iTunes or go into Big Picture and do the Steam music feature to have a better time than this. There is also no story. I want to know the story between these 2 'D-J's-'! I got this with playfire and it wasn't even worth the price of free! Levels are very repetative. Jump. Jump. Die. Jump. (and the occasional) Slide. That's it! The achievments seem imposible too. HOW CAN YOU NOT DIE ON THE FIRST LEVEL IF YOU NEED TO GET TRAPPED IN A ROOM FULL OF SPIKES TO COMPLETE THE LEVEL???!!\n*UPDATE 6/14/14* There is a way to not die in the 1st level and it is extremly hard to get it. When I go on music longer than 3 minutes, my game freezes up for a few seconds and plays the song. It's not even worth that wait! You can only listen to about 1 minute of the song! Then when you go to the next level, it won't take you to the place where you left off, IT WILL TAKE YOU TO THE SONG BEFORE IT!!! I don't want to listen to their techno crap thing. I listen to metal. It claims everything will be fast paced if you play a fast paced song. I played War Ensemble by Slayer. It took forever to load. Everything seemed about as fast as a really old and simple song. I still do not recommend this game and probably never will unless they fix anything. If I play M.I.A by Avenged Sevenfold in the level selection, the Djs start humping their turntables.","May 22, 2014","false","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not really original or unique, but not overly challenging either. I think I enjoy it because it tends to find the sweet spot of being challenging yet forgiving. Of course, there are exceptions (I'm looking at you, level 42) but. Admittedly it's a game that fails at what it's trying to do since the music-based elements hardly tend to feel like it at all and mostly end up being random (many songs won't even have consistent behaviors on the environment, so...). And the game has a tendency to be glitchy as well.\nAlso I should mention that the soundtrack is just alright. Electronic music isn't really my thing. There's a few songs I like anyways though. But normally I kept to only using those few songs.\nAlso two of the achievements are broken and/or impossible. If that matters to you. Kind of miffed about it myself.\nAnd the devs have abandoned the game already so if that's a dealbreaker, then sure.\nHonestly it's kind of hard to defend this game all things considered, but that doesn't mean I can't still like it.\n\nEDIT: In retrospect this is a pretty cruddy game isn't it. Just browsing through my old reviews like "why is this a positive review" and so okay. Meh. I've played too many platformers to have any good will towards bad platformers nowadays.","March 1, 2014","false","19.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love rhythm games and I grew up playing platformers. The game doesn't play as much to the beat but rather tries its best to simulate one. Some of the later levels are Super Meat Boy level difficult, but with all these terrible obstacles sort of matched to the rhythm it makes the game frustrating.\n\nThe game has 47 levels and the difficulty ramps up quite quickly. Eventually, spikes start to move so quickly that prediction is necessary to avoid death, but the game is extremely checkpoint heavy to its benefit. There are some spikes that move backwards, and at this point the game devolved into masocore (eg I wanna Be The Guy) levels of nonsense.\n\nEarly on the most painful levels are ones that make you repeat the stage repeatedly, unlocking the next door only to be forced to drop down to start the level over again to get the next key for the next door. The worst levels are those that are heavily layered and filled with traps so if you fall you can lose a lot of time. After that are the "boss" levels, which get rid of the generous checkpointing you rely on. The thing I found to be most helpful was to find the song with the quietest beginning that wouldn't trigger most obstacles and spam LB to replay it over and over again. It took away from the musical aspect of the game, but the musical aspect is a suggestion at best.\n\nThe game doesn't react very well to your music and there are only a few obstacles that do: spikes, table saws, rising platforms, repulsor bumpers (think Super Meat Boy) and zombies. There are a handful of others that are static like buzz saws and spikes. The repulsors are the worst obstacle in this game because on any given song it seemed to be random when they would activate, which led to a lot of long falling and time lost.\n\nThe zombies are probably annoying too but I couldn't see them because there was a bug(?) where they stopped spawning after I restarted my game to fix another bug where the game wouldn't checkpoint me at all. I considered the former a beneficial bug so I didn't restart the game again.\n\nI got this game for free and my favorite thing about it was being able to listen to a few good songs that I had forgotten about in my music library. Also, the rainbow level toward the end was pretty okay.","March 14, 2015","false","4.6"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

Otherwise a worse-than-average platformer.\n\nFull Review:\n- Gameplay\nThe game and level design is awful. It is a simple platformer with constantly flashing lights that do no part to make the game look nice and your friends don't here what music you are playing. If anything, the music is just what you play in the background. You don't jump, dodge or do anything that is related to the music, fully contrary to what it claims “Discover gameplay with custom music” . There's nothing to customise at all.\n\n- Controls\nThe controls are also simple but really plain because of the poor execution. You find yourself trying hard to jump, run, dodge, not because it is difficult, but because the game mechanis are just off. You respawn next to the obstacle which continues to run even when you die, so you are essentially waiting for the right moment to jump -- and even then, it doesn't feel fun doing that. It is not tense at all. It is boring jumps and runs all the way.\n\n- Verdict\nI am glad I got it for free.

To put the game into perspective quickly, think of a Super Meat Boy with much less going on in terms of.... well everything. Rush Bros has an initial theme, good music, and the ability to use your own music, but that's about it.\nEven the music incorperation element seemed to be lacking quite a lot. The game is the same without the music, just less flashing. In fact, the small mechanics that use music makes no sense (ex, the movement of the spikes). The biggest irk I have with Rush Bros is that it even uses music. it would be just as good with a fixed soundtrack and little incorperation of music (like it is now pretty much.) The songs you put into the game will end premature and ruin flow.\n\nThe levels also felt very much like Coursebot Mario Maker levels (for those of you who don't know, 'Coursebot' is just the thing that dishes out premade and easy levels in the 10 mario challenge) because of their basic feeling, easy difficulty and leisurely pace. Rebuttle to this oppion, this game came out in 2013 and Mario Maker, 2015. Some ideas just where just out of XYLAs grasp.\n","January 25","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
