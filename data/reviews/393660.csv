Every game mode pops you on a rectangular layer of blocks that are then hit by red blocks from above that damage and deform the layer. You have two powers, one restores the layer and replenishes with time (or not, in hard mode) and another that I haven't figured out at all (slow motion, sort of). You get scored on how long you manage not to fall as the platform crumbles around you. That is all there is to this game - well, there's a beta builder where you make non-rectangular layers. Whoop-de-doo.\n\nIt's annoying me because it is one of those first person 3D platformers where you can't see your feet, yet would wish to land on cubes precisely.\n\nI see nothing here that makes me want to play this.\n\nNote that there won't be any further updates as of January 11th since the devs had a hard drive crash and no backups. Serves them right.","February 1","false","0.2"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","18","20","0","6"

Stay alive as long as possible before you end up falling through outer space for eternity!  Yikes!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyR0I50rAn0\n\nThe world in comprised of nice looking reflective blocks and the outer space all around you is simply gorgeous.\n\nAdd in a very funky, fun, and fast paced musical background and you are ready for your attempt at surivivng as long as possible.  To beat your friends score, every second of surviving here is vital!  Where do you step?  Do you risk jumping the crumbling blocks to get to the other side where it looks safer and were you might live another 30 seconds?\n\nThis game offers two modes: Platform and Dash.  Platform is a big square area that is crumbling as red blocks smash into it from above.  In platform, every second you survive adds another point.  Dash offers a narrow, long base that you run back and forth on always trying to grab the blue score balls that will increase your score.  In each mode, the left mouse button will do some repair to blocks as they are falling apart, but once they have formed a hole, it's too late.  Each mode also offers three difficulty levels to make sure you are always challenged.  Other then that, the objective is to simply score as many points before you fal to your death!\n\nMy score for this game based on my personal scoring system is an 81%  Watch the above provided video to see how I came up with my score if you are interested.\n\nDefinite thumbs up especially for family get togethers and parties!  Certain to provide lots of laughs and draw interest as you play it!\n\nBONUS VIDEO!  Watch my 10 year old son try to beat his dad (me) at this game:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0CRD0dzbWo","September 2, 2015","true","0.5"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","10","16","3","0"

Aside from the ability to sprint huge distances you have a "reality warping" ability of sorts where you can temporarily "repair" the road and prevent it from breaking apart.\n\nNow only if they could make the tiles brighter as sometimes it's difficult to see them.

Dash mode is broken at the moment but I hope it gets fixed soon. Some pretty cool mechanics, Being able to partly rebuild the damage on the platform ater being destroyed. Sprinting is pretty meh, doesn't feel like a direct speed boost. Platform mode is probably the best in my opinion, because it gives you a large platform to run on, and that means more micro-managing because there are more areas to rebuild after being destroyed. There are some pretty weird aspects with say, lighting. The number one thing is how your body and cubes are for the most part the same color. I would like to see a distinct costume or soemthing along those lines that the character wears, and the blocks to be a brighter color.  Overall a pretty good timekiller.
