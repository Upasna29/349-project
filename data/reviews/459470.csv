First impression quite good: A LOT of game depth, tones of units and statistics, fog of war and proper army/corps displays and move with a per day/week system, quite interesting. The essential Napoleonic atmosphere was there, as well as the historical accuracy that history geeks like myself enjoy. There was a first dissapointment - no "tutorial game" to guide you through all the mechanics, something that I consider essential for "deep" tactical games, but what the hell - I simply watched all the tutorial videos instead, taking notes like a proper wargaming geek.\n\nThe first scenario (Waterloo) went well, if we exclude the fact I got confused a few times with organisation of corps and movement, its a different thing to watch and to do it. I got there eventually and played through, but by the end of it another dissapointment emerged: Knowing almost nothing of the game, I easily won as France; the AI seemed to comprehent even less about the game than I did.\n\nSo is that the reason of the thumbs down - hell no. It is the fact that upon starting the other scenarios, the game crashes begun. At first I think "ok its a crash, it can happen". Then the second crash a turn later starts to ♥♥♥♥ you off and you change the Austerlitz scenario to the Prussian campaign. Then a third crash happens with the Prussians, so decide that I should no longer play the allies because with the French it did not crash during the first scenario. So I take the French in the Grand Campaign, taking 20 minutes to do a proper turn and it crashes again... twice.\n\nIt is somewhere here that I stop trying. I do not mind the 30 euros, I would buy even if it was 50 because its my type of game. Nor will I ask for money back, hoping that later patches will fix it. But until then... the game is not ready. I sincerely hope the developers do something about it, because its evident that there is a lot of effort and love into this game and I want to play it. So I am waiting and hoping, but currently not recommending it unless people don't mind crashes every 30 minutes or so.","May 7","false","14.1"," 108 of 131 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","108","131","3","12"

Unstable, somewhat buggy... May be a great game if issues are fixed (and if the AI is improved). Noting that it has been in that state for the last 5 months, before hitting Steam, I would not hold my breath.\n\nGame in current state is worth 2.99 in my view... Once it delivers what is promised, it may be worth the full price.","May 8","false","14.8"," 37 of 55 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","37","55","0","2"

Bear with me this might be a long text (if you're bored just skip to tl;dr down below).\n\nI have bought the game on 2 December 2015, the devs have the tendency to publish on historical dates (December 2 is the date of the battle of Austerlitz) adn they did it again with May 5 (Napoleon's death) although it was delayed a bit. This may seem a trivial thing BUT they release this game in an unplayable state regardless just because the date was historical.\nI love Napoleon and his Age a lot, every time I hear about the Napoleonic era I get proud like it was a tale about my grandfather. I have bought and played every single napoleonic game in existence, board game and \ or card game. So it came natural for me to buy this one, despite the fact that Pride of Nations, another title by AgeoD, didnt suit my taste, but then again, that was probably because it was very complicated and hard to get into. The devs have a history of good games on their shoulders, despite being in very small number. I was confident that historical accuracy was their aim and they would deliver, but the game was absolutely broken.\n\nFoundamental elements like the UI, the buttons, the saving system, everything was either not functioning, or missing, or prone to crash every turn. It seems that the Steam release is still under development, because the last patch didnt fix all the bugs and spelling errors and silly scripts that undermine the game. I have complained on the devs forum and it was told to me that "they are a small team and they have a very tiny budget". Well then, that excuse doesnt work: let me tell you this: if you know that you are a small dev team, and you are not confident in a product of this magnitude being released, because you know that you need more time and tests to run, then dont release the game in a "beta" state. It is as simple as that. Instead, players are treated as beta testers and even now the team is asking for feedback and support because there are a ton more people like me that had problems in the past and still do to this day. In my case, the game crashes at random times between turns very early on, or gives strange error messages in the option menu. The frame rate is atrocious, even for an i7 CPU; in the text messages which are describing currency in the game, sometimes they refer to "dollars", sometimes to "pounds".\nI just dont understand the developers' behaviour. Quite frankly, AgeoD needs to pull their stuff together and get it done properly, and learn from their mistakes. To the potential buyers I say: dont buy this game in its current state. Wait several months until you are absolutely sure that the product is worth the price. I paid 40 Eur to be a betatester, dont make the same mistake.\n\ntl;dr - The game is still an "under construction" beta and if you buy it you get to be a beta tester with an empty wallet. Wait for this game to be finished properly. Also, it is apparent that this is not a finished game as the devs didnt even bother to get rid of the debug log.","May 7","false","9.3"," 42 of 66 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","42","66","0","6"

I had some CTDs which were solved because I  wanted to play the game a lot. So I asked on the Matrix and Ageod tech-support forums and they provided me with things I could do to stop it crashing. It worked and since that time the game has not crashed once. So before you keyboard away stating that the game is buggy and dismissing it from those reasons, maybe it could be in your interests to actually go to the Matrix Games or Slitherine or Ageod Forums and ask for advice, because you will get answers on how to fix the game. Right.\n\nWoN is a true Grand Strategy title of the Napoleonic Wars starting from 1805 till Waterloo in 1815. Any Ageod veteran will become familiar with the way the game plays; much complexity with creating Armies, Corps, finding the right leader for command. The map is gigantic, a very attractive map of Europe, with 'boxes' on the side so you can pull in war materials, money etc, from America or India with your Merchant Fleets, building Privateers for raiding, etc. Not a big part of the game, but an interesting aspect to it nonetheless. Beware - do not expect an easy game. If you are new to these type of wargames then be prepared for a learning curve, quite steep, but the rewards are great just spending time learning the game. If you are a fan of anything Napoleonic and want something with the history, the attention to detail, impressive gameplay (I advise play France first) and just a 'feel' for the times, then this game will not disappoint in any way.\n\nGood game.","May 7","true","43.7"," 22 of 31 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","22","31","0","3"

Avoids the problem of many games of having constant war with all the allies vs France as diplomacy plays a major role.  Critical states such as Austria and Russia have other interests than just war with France - in particular both can gain a lot by attacking the Ottomans.\n\nFor the French, winning early victories is relatively easy, bringing down Perfidious Albion much harder and sooner or later Britain's squabbling allies will start to co-operate.  ....

Great game, cannot recommend it enough, due to its depth, scope, GUI, graphics.\n\nThe CTDs mentioned by others can be ameliorated by changing game settings at startup, doing regular saves, getting the latest patch - visit the AGEOD forum for the game, where there are lots of tips on this.  It's a resource intensive game, so minimize that where possible, for instance not loading all the map at startup.\n\nThe game is absolutely playable - I have many hours with it, before I got it registered on Steam  It has a learning curve.  I note most of the 'no' recommendations on Steam are from people who have played the game just fractions of an hour, or so.  Give the game some time.  Do the tutorials.\n\nThis is the ultimate Napoleonic era game, and if you'll invest some time in it, you won't regret it.","May 12","true","0.4"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

Grasping gameplay can be slow and sometimes frustrating, however, the designers (and the fans) of the game are very responsive to questions on the forums and will happily answer any questions, both technical/gameplay.\n\nWith that said, sometimes there will be CTDs, but they are few and far between, make sure to save your game before processing a turn.\n\nIt's a great game and will keep the player absorbed and engaged, much like Napoleon himself, as you try to bring your enemy to heel.\n\nRating: 8/10","May 16","true","4.6"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

The team responsible for the game listen to feedback from the players, and the game has been updated a couple of times; the errors are slowly getting ironed out, but the game is still highly playable as is it.
