This game was originally contained no "18+" scenes; as such, the Steam version is exactly the same as the Mangagamer one. The art-style is great, voice-acting has some famous seiyuu and story lasts around 30-50 hours depending on how many routes you want to explore. Each route is has its own unique story and veers off the common route relatively early on.\n\nThose of you that question the high price tag need to consider that vocie actors charge quite the premium every time their voices are used. For a length game like this, the price is quite high for the localization company as well; hence the $35 price tag.\n\nThe story itself has a nice mix of Summerian, Christrian and other minor mythologies. The three main female leads all have bad endings with story, a normal end and a True ending that you unlock once you view the other required endings. The characters are quite likable with their own backstories to flesh them out.\n\nAside from some cheesy moments, there's no reason not to like this game. If you like story based visual novels that's not just the typical nukige trash on Steam I recommend buying this and voting with your wallet.","April 1","true","51.9"," 92 of 94 people (98%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","98","92","94","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zetto_/recommended/443380/","Zetto_","Zetto","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zetto_/","253 products in account","There's action, romance, comedy, drama, horror, suspense and all of it is just so damned fun. That's Tokyo Babel in a nutshell.\n\nThe description on the store page pretty much perfectly sums up the story, and there's a free demo available at the mangagamer site, so I will instead go on about the things I like about this VN that makes me recommend it. Additionally I will remark that I at least enjoyed all the characters and found something to like in all of them, though given how that is somewhat subjective, I would refrain from adding that as a plus.\n\nFor a VN it takes up nearly nine gigabytes of space, and all of that space is spent on top quality effects, animations and CGs, all of which make the experience feel a lot less static than your typical VNs. If there's a ball of fire being described, you'll see a ball of fire. If there's a pillar of water, you'll see a geyser effect on your screen. A background will pan around a bit with bits of debris and smoke. The game makes sure the text is usually accompanied with some effect to further immerse you in the action going on.  The character sprites bounce around, move from side to side, and are just expressive in general. I haven't seen this in a lot of VNs I played and is just really nice with how much effort they put into it.\n\nThe story is gripping, goes along at a good pace, and fills you in on the lore of the place the game is set while never seeming like an info dump. This game is a lot like Fate/Stay Night, taking inspiration from myth and legends and building up their characters from various figures from them. The use of the esoteric in this game is pretty well done, much like Umineko and their handling of the occult, with of course a flair that only the Japanese making a VN with moe characters and grand epic battles can pull off while mixing such things.\n\nThe voice acting comes from some of the industry's top talent. If you're halfway interested in anime, you'll hear someone you have heard before from a popular anime. The music is all well done, though personally a part of me feels as though there could have been just a little more variety, though that doesn't at all mean there's a dearth of tracks available. There are thirty unique pieces of music available (from the music selection menu), and they're all pretty darn good. Presentation wise, it's all top stuff.\n\nThe best part is that there's a lot of game to play through. VNDB lists about 30 to 50 hours, and I went through one of the three routes available in about 12 hours, so I would say depending on your reading speed, that is about right. This is a LARGE VN, and it's just great. I know I will find no fault with the other routes and will probably only have a better opinion of the game as the later routes. Many people will probably be scared off by the price, but I can say I do not regret paying full price for this VN.","April 3","true","32.6"," 34 of 35 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","34","35","0","1"

Has surpassed all my expectations (especially being my first visual novel indulgence despite owning Steins' Gate).  If you have any interest in esoteric studies, this game is well worth your time and money.

It was up there with Fate/Stay Night and to a lesser degree Muv-Luv Alternative.\n\nIt had engaging actions scenes and an enjoyable protaganist. The world felt fairly well fleshed out and kept me intrested.\nEnough to even make me check out the bad endings, somthing I rarely do.\n\nWhile I felt two of the heroines could of been fleshed out a bit more, they made sense in the overall plot.\nIf you enjoy action visual novels and a twist on Christian mythology then this game is for you. The high production values are obvious in the animation and art quality, soundtrack was decent as well.","April 8","true","41.4"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

Finished it in one go, which took me about 32 hours and I am a relatively quick reader. Found the play with Old Testament lore interesting and the wikikpedia included in the game learned me a new thing or two about said lore. Liked the humor that offset the more serious parts of the story quiet nicely. Loved for example the interplay between Rachel and Lillith when playing the computer game Civilization. Definitely worth my money and I would love to see more VNs as these with this same length of play.","May 3","true","31.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Don't let the price-tag cloud your mind. One reason why the game costs $35 is because of the voice actors. They do an amazing job doing the voices of the characters. They show a lot of emotion, especially the guy who voices our main protagonist, Setsuna. This one is not some kind of harem or romance novel, (there is romance, but the story isn't focused majority around that) but one that actually has a story to tell. I don't like to compare visual novels, but this one intrigued me the most. I didn't expect a lot from the game, but it took me by surprise. The amount of effort put into it is tremendously high, and I like that. Good games like this should be recognized more, so that's why I though about typing a review. The game is action-packed with amazing fights that often lead to heart-wearming moments. Here is a list of pros, and maybe cons.\n\nPros\n+ A long visual novel, but not time-consuming like CLANNAD\n+ 170 Graphic Pictures\n+ 48 Backgrounds\n+ 8 Endings (Bad, True, and Good endings)\n+ This game has extra features; this gives you the lore of the characters and terms\n+ 26 music and 4 songs (All of them are amazing)\n+ Voice actors are top-notch\n\nCons\n- ...\n\nIn Conclusion This is currently my favorite visual novel that I have ever played. Everything is in it: comedy, action, romance, etc. To be fair, I'm a bit bias. However, this game offers so much. After playing all the routes and getting the true endings I felt sad that I already finished the game. It's one of those games that I would love to forget about so I can play it again without remembering the story. In conclusion, I give this game a big yes!","May 9","true","36.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Raison d'etre stuffs really helps making the fight more grand and develops characters at the same time.\n- Didn't expect the slice of life scenes to be not so out of place. Can't explain it really well but it really fits the main character groups pretty well.. some of you might not like it though.\n- Character endings are satisfying all around instead of just focusing on true end. I didn't expect that considering my previous experience with Higashide is Ayakashibito.\n- Some characters feels like they're under developed but at least each of them has their own ending, making them not forgotten to the readers.\n\nit's pretty okay","April 4","true","30.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Tokyo Babel is about a protagonist, led by a series of encounters, gains a sense of self and strength to keep on living for the future. A LOT of lore is involved, so if you are interested in that area of study, then you would absolutely love reading how the story here plays out.\n\nI struggled through many of the descriptive action scenes. It felt like the writers are needlessly stretching the scenes with needlessly descriptive details of the battles. I mean, I didn't really care how "this sword" was as strong as "this modern weapon", or how "this injury" was as great as "this". Other than that, I really enjoyed reading the actual story-telling of Tokyo Babel. Every character had their own conflicts, and their own conclusions. The last (locked) route in particular, gave every character's conflicts and conclusions the brightest shine. A lot of these scenes outside of the action scenes, were mesmerizing to read.
