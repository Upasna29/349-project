Be prepared to lose resorces for winning pvp matches.That's right you lose for winning! If a person trys to fight you and you accept and then he pays you to flee battle you get a win and maybe a little gold from the payout BUT you will lose 5k food 5k wood and 5k stone from your towns resorce stash which varries depending on what your stash has in it but that was my last loss to this bug. Not only do you lose for winning a pvp match in this manner you don't recieve the crowns for the win that you are supposed to get for winning.The only way to avoid this bug is to fight until the game tells you you won or lost.\n\nBUGS! That's right more bugs.This one however is in your favor.When creating troops to build an army some times you will dupe extra units.\n\nBUGS! Your city is full of small bugs that are annoying at times but minor and not worth more then a mention that thay are there.\n\nTHE MOTHER OF ALL BUGS! This is a big one in my opinion! Be prepared to lose it all! That's right and not because you can be captured or destroyed by another player but because everytime the dev's change the game some people not all but at random get a full wipe including your account like you never exisited in the first place. The money you spent "poof gone" the time you spent "poof gone". I know this first hand as both my maxed out city's got wiped and in return i didn't even get a response from the support team. After the first time i said "ok i haven't played in a wile no big deal i lost my stuff" and i moved on rebuilt spent money on the starter packs and was back on top in a few weeks and that's when the dev's changed the game again and i lost it all again.Sense the game came out pre f2p i have put about 60$ into the game and 288 hours which i wish at this point i had not but if you don't mind losing it all and spending money and time on a game so that a bug can rob you in the end then this game is for you!\n\nThere are some cool things about kingdom wars but the amount of bugs makes the amount of cool things not worth the mention as the bugs destroy the enjoyment all together.The dev's don't really care about the game the bugs have been there forever and have never been fixed the team took what was supposed to be an update to kingdom wars and made it a stand alone game "kingdom wars 2: battles" which is the same game with a cuple added fetures.The team only did this to pump more money out of people instead of fixing and updating the game they had already created "Kingdom wars" leaving KW broken and a waste of time and money.\n\nIn the end i can't say i recommend any games from this team as they don't put any real care into the games they create beyond publishing bug filled crap they have no intention to fix.","November 2, 2015","false","288.7"," 414 of 459 people (90%) found this review helpful 31 people found this review funny","90","414","459","31","14"

At first I had a very low opinion of it, but if you can overcome the first hour of the game and look past its shortcomings you'll find a very addictive experience with so much potential.\n\n\nNegative impressions:  Visually it looks as if it made in the early 2000s, and the combat leaves a lot to be desired. Once battle is joined unit formations devolve into disorganized mosh-pit like globs with very poor unit collision detection (if any at all.) The animations are primitive and very basic, not just in combat but for walking, idle, and cutscenes dialog. There are also a host of bugs, many of which are highly destructive and infuriating. The worst I encountered was when I lost an entire army, 28 units, because a quest sent them into a void and left me with an empty army on the map- without even starting the quest. I was left without my hero unit, and an entire day worth of invested resources that I used to build said army.\n\nPositive Impressions: The economic system and a load of fun, and by far the best part of the game aside from the general idea. You can make profits by trading, harvesting resources, looting battlefields, and questing. Each option presents its own benefits and challenges. If you decide to harvest resources at home then you will looking at the safest and most reliable way, but it also means you need peasants working the land which drags on your unit cap. Trade is the quickest way, but it also means you’re at risk of losing caravans and thus your cargo. It also requires more management and the natural risk of losing money on a trade if you’re too hasty.\n\nThe game has a pretty mild pace, which is certainly a positive in my opinion. You won’t become powerful overnight, and all buildings and soldiers take quite a bit of resources and time to make. There is also a healthy variety of units and plenty of defining traits to pick from. Units gain experience from battles which lets you upgrade them, in addition to researching new technologies and equipment. From what I can tell there is no pay-to-win advantage either. The cashhop is purely aesthetics and speeding up the process of questing rewards.\n\nIf the combat would be overhauled then I think this would be an easy game to recommend, and if animations and visuals where modernized then it would be a jewel. However as it stands it’s a give and take. If you can overlook its issues there is a lot of fun to be had, but not everyone can do that.\n","October 23, 2014","true","18.7"," 149 of 175 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","149","175","0","0"

This one is neither, through the efforts of the developers and a great part of the community it has worked toward something truly unique. I have played my share of games that had Pay to Win (or elements of it) schemes going on in the background, yet never had I seen one where the developers actually completely changed the game because of critisism from the players themselves... I know of no better community of players then the ones who stalk the digital halls of Kingdom Wars, (it's the only game that I leave the chat window open on) when there was a shortage of Moderators the players themselves would offer advice to the new arrivals. Simply put, my hours should speak for themselves, and I intend to continue for a long time.\n\nMany people have claimed that Kingdom Wars is rough around the edges, that it is, but those same people usually don't stick around enough to see the simple truth that we veterans know by heart... (or atleast we should by now) "If you don't like it, spend some time and wait for the next update." So in closing, it's fun, it's free, and no other game in the genre can come close to it's majesty!","April 18, 2015","true","262.1"," 140 of 163 people (86%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","86","140","163","12","5"

If you loose a sqaud of high level soilders it's not the end of the world but you feel bad.\n\nThe game is almost too slow to start, but after 5-6 hours you start to see the gold coming in. You might have read it's "pay to win". You can spend cash for crowns which buy's you the special units or upgrades, yet after you get established it's easy to build a bank of crowns. Your gold even starts to overflow to the point where a good portion of the time your lugging your troops around from town to town selling goods.\n\nWhatever race you chose to play isn't a total lock, you can still buy units from the other races. One of the key factors is collecting your loot off of dead bodies, I strongly recomand  getting Female Wardens from the elf race because you can simply select their duty to collect loot and they do it fast compared to human peasents.\n\nThe AI isn't great.  They are going to attack is how they are going to attack. Generally they don't engage you till you engage them. If they try to flank it's a pre-determined before the game even starts. The AI doesn't adjust to the battlefield and what is going on. The AI will flank when basically you already broke the line.\n\nArchers and Crossbow men are generally a strong staple of castle RTS'. They aren't effective. When you see 60-80 Archers on a castle ridge after a few times it doesn't make you turn your soilders around.\n\nThe big draw back besides the lack of PvP fights, which when they do happen are very laggy is the overall Missions of the game. Basically it's fighting a small group of soilders, or laying into a castle.  Most of the missions are putting down rebel armies of peasents.\n\nThe developer has been putting out patches, but the game isn't new, so I'm not sure what the future holds in stock. If they make a second one, I think they will get the game right.\n\nI enjoyed my time with the game, but with no real challange and a weak storyline that actually may not have a ending , it's hard to say "Yes" or "No" to the game.  However, if your looking to play a RTS game and can't find one I would give it a shot, it did provide me several hours of gaming.","January 18, 2014","true","99.7"," 216 of 275 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","216","275","0","0"

Take game time played into consideration.\nIt took me a good 4 hours before I finally got hooked.

The story line is a bit interesting too. This is definitely worth the FREE download and try. The game runs on my outdated subpar computer. Game is NOT pay to win. You can chat, have friends, create an empire and a guild. You can control multiple cities and races, and armies. You can have vassals, do co op with friends, and show off your high leveled up units. All the races are viable to play.\n\nCONS-\n\nLarge battles tend to lag and make clicking important things hard to do and the combat systems leave much to be desired as the units are sometimes oblivious to quite obvious enemies and sometimes stand there and do nothing or chase after an enemy while forgetting the actual enemy you clicked on for it to target. You cannot melee a moving unit, even if you are faster and chasing that unit. Town population cap of only 90. Hero unit level cap of only 60. Towns are only semi customizable as you cannot place whatever you want, wherever you want you have to build on plots, and you cannot really design your defenses or choose where you put the walls, towers and gates. Cannot actually view friends towns and you cannot add a new friend if that friend is currently offline. Can only click/use one referral code. Limited town storage and upgrading your storage buildings does not increase it. Upgrading buildings in general should improve things relating to that building, but in most cases it does nothing other than increase the HP of the building.\n\nI know my list of cons is big, but I put it there because I wish the game were a bit better in these areas, however, regardless of the cons this game is still amazing and I cant put it down.","May 14, 2015","true","116.2"," 69 of 83 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","69","83","5","0"

Low res graphics, buyable units, premium accounts and Purchasable city plots. All of it was too Pay-to-Winesque for me. But after having spent quite some hours into the Game by talking and bonding with the Community I very rapidly discovered how wrong my assumptions were. Buyable units are easily stomped on by non-buyable units. Premium is merely a small bonus. While it may not be Pay To Win on the gameplay part it does have a few knacks of its own, for example: ''Starting another city'' with another race and settings requires a payment of 4.99$ or by deleting your current City. This feature is very stupid as it limits you to only 1 race which limits the player from sinking more time into the game without sinking money into the game. A very positive change would be if they gave you 2 slots instead of 1, maybe when they release the Undead race they will give everyone a 2nd slot. HINT HINT\n\nUpdates are pumped in weekly so expect bugs/glitches that you might encounter to be fixed soon\nNext to bug and glitches fixes new content is added to. Such as skins, units, buildings maybe even a whole new race.\nOn a side note, this game is still pretty unstable, on a daily basis people come in and complain about how they crashed during big battles or that certain things aren't working. One of the Major malfunctions in this game is the fact that Online gameplay isn't fully server hosted causing bugs with Resource gathering from time to time, but that is simply because they don't have the financial support to make everything more server dependent. Which is where you come in.\n\nGameplay itself is very solid. While the Army management is pretty flonky because of bugs with manual Army mapping and you can only select 18 Units at once, it is still fun and massive, there are some performance issues with big armies moving around and large fights (FPS drops and sometimes Crashes) it is still very fun, competitive and enjoyable. A few issues here and there make the competitive part of this game ALOT less... competitive, such as Battle protection pausing when going offline. But it is still carried forward by the massive rewards PvPing and PvEing give, especially late game.\nThe best part of it, when you start PvP you can't be put up against opponents with a larger or smaller army then yours, making it completely skill reliant.\n\nPros\n-Solid game\n-Solid experience\n-Lots of dialogue\n-Wide open-world with lots of provided Lore\n-Updates are sinked in on a weekly basis\n-Lots of playability\n-Fun and growing community\n-Lots of content\n-Beautiful design\n\nCons:\n-Bad AI\n-Inconsistent unit collission\n-Workers not always doing what they are told to until you manually send them\n-Extremely buggy\n-Not enough is server hosted\n-An extreme amount of dialogue (This could be a Pro depends on how you look at it)\n-Extremely low res (Ruins the design part by quite alot)\n-Some Pay to Win elements that do need to be removed\n-Pretty hard learning curve for newcomers\n-Unit management is not that good (HD patch would help xP)\n\nThis may look very negative but as a whole the Pros outmatch the Cons by far, since the Developers of this game are working very hard to take charge and improve this game as a whole. While some issues may not be fixed in a few weeks, months or even Years it still is a solid experience and a must play for Hardcore RTS players that want to enjoy both sides of an MMORTS, the Town management and PvP without PvP taking the cake like in most MMORTS games.\nThe best part of this, it's free.","November 6, 2014","true","37.3"," 61 of 73 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","61","73","2","1"

What you have here is a solid, fun, online RTS game, with some innovative original flourishes.\n\nPros:\n\n= Three distinct factions with very different play styles both in terms of city building, unit disposition and battle tactics. They are further differentiated by their own distinct unit, building and UI art, quest lines and voice acting. Each faction can also recruit a variety of mercenary units to further enhance army customization.\n\n= The battle pacing is just right. Look I'm an old fart, so I prefer a game where I can actually see the action unfold rather than everything be over in the blink of an eye. The pace of combat is somewhat slower in DoF than in other contemporary RTS games. I think this is a good thing becasue it allows for more tactical options and also negates any ping advantages in multiplayer.\n\n= Heaps of single player content. Each faction has a very generous quest line which I estimate to be around 30+ hours worth per side, not counting replayable missions. There are also countless NPC skirmishes to explore in a variety of landscapes against varied NPC elements.\n\n= The quests are involved and interesting. They have put a great deal of thought into felshing out details of the fantasy world. It's not a testiment to originality, but it's a top notch effort for a video game setting. I love how half of what the elves say is made up gibberish with no explanation offered, but after an hour or so in the game you find yourself understanding it all.\n\n\nCons:\n\n= There are a few technical issues especially with pathfinding, but nothing that some patience and practice can not overcome.\n\n= Multiplayer is a mixed bag. You can grind out a very formidable army against NPCs and newbies can get crushed if they dive in unprepared. That being said, when the balance is just right, they battles are a lot of fun.\n\n= Speaking of grind, there is a bit of it. It's an online game so the pace of progression is sedate. You won't max your units out over a weekend. Your rank and file units can also be permanently lost, so you need to be paying attention. I personally like the perma death touch for some units (hero units take an xp penalty instead when they get "KOed"), but I can understand why some people would consider it a negative.\n\n\nAll in all I had a great time with DoF. If you're an RTS fan and looking for something a little different and long term, you should definately pick this up during the sale. It's a steal for seven bucks.","January 21, 2014","true","15.9"," 36 of 44 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","36","44","0","5"

Resource gathering\nResources are gathered by peasants (stone, wood, gold, food - though food is a bit different as you can slaughter pigs that are "fattened" for a large food income). Each peasant unit takes 1 population space and costs some food.\n\n1. Story about my wizard and about "wealth" (crowns)\nFor quite a while I had battle protection as a starter player. This battle protection gave me enough time to form an army, walls and a wizard. Wizard is an extremely strong unit. Maximum population number of town is 90 I think - you can increase the initial low population limit by building houses - also, you can have initially up to 5 armies outside of your town on map - each army has 60 population cap (Normal units take 1/90), wizard takes 10 and costs 120 crowns. Crowns are gained either by paying 5000 gold (daily limit of bought crowns is 30) or winning a pvp/pve battle (siege or army fight) [You can get 20-40 crowns for winning when attacked by enemy player in your town). A wizard needs further spell upgrades to be able to cast spells (10,20,40,80 and 150 crowns - example for lightning (of the Deep) wizard: shield,drain stamina, buff allies, large aoe attack, teleport) so it's very expensive unit. Once I got the wizard and trained him to get to higher level and bought 2 spells (shield gives him extreme resistance to everything and aoe attack kills everything sooner or later) I was able to siege enemy castle with one man - the wizard.\n\n[h1] 2. First defence of my town [/h1]\n\nThis happened when I finished building my inner stone wall and outer wooden wall (There are 2 types of wall - One made out of wood and the other one is made out of stone, stone is very expensive and there is inner (cheaper) and outer part - outer is much more expensive than the inner one, it's like a second layer of walls) and placed trebuchets on them (you can build trebuchets, rock throwers (close range) or hot oil thingy that pours hot oil on top of the enemy) on top of stone walls. I recalled all of my peasants into my middle part of the town. I chose to fight the enemy. I placed my archers on the wall - on the side from where the enemy was coming. He started attacking my town with trebuchets, he focused on my outer wooden wall and used fiery stones that set the area around my walls on fire. I had plenty of stone in my town and you can buy stone during battle for gold if you have market built so I started aiming all of my trebuchets (the ones on the walls) at those trebuchets. In 4 minutes the enemy trebuchets were destroyed. Then I opened the outer wooden door. As I expected, enemy archers started pouring in, hoping to shoot my people, cattle and soldiers. As soon as they passed my gate I closed it behind them. They were trapped in my outer wall part of town. I started ordering all of my elven rangers (best archers in game, I got them from befriending one elven town and buying them in it) to increase their rate of fire and fire at the enemy archers. Then I opened my inner gate and sent all of my unicorns (also elven unit, they use them for gaining gold and as a cavalry. My wizard kept placing defencive shield on my rangers and they kept firing while unicorns were slaughtering the archers and crossbowmen. They died in 2 minutes. Only thing that remained were enemy melee units behind my wall. I sent my archers to shoot them from safety of my walls and aimed my trebuchets with another 3000 stone remaining (Enough for a long time of constant firing from few trebuchets). The enemy surrendered before I managed to obliterate the rest of his army. I got 28 crowns. The whole siege was like 20 minutes long.\n\nI find this game very nice - also, any units you loose during the pvp or pve fights is dead permanently (except wizards, main hero and other heroes like them)\n\n[b] UPDATE: I've returned to playing this game, got affected by a roll-back and lost most of my proggress - I was given codes for crowns (ingame currency, something like "cash" type of money  in most games, dragon and a [u]free code for Kingdom Wars 2: Battles[/u] <- It took them only [u]43 minutes to reply[/u] with these "refunds".

I felt like I had to have a #2\n\nCON:\n- Plagued by a crown system which stunts your rapid growth/gameplay unless you play real $ at an outrageous price\n- Once you have finished your "introductory" crown based protection system, you have to pay more real money or use all the crowns you saved for upgrades, if you don't want to PVP. If you want to Co-Op all of the time, don't buy this game at all. It just isn't for you.\n- No custom castle/wall/tower building--everything is pre-designated\n- Requires real $ to customize your city or hero (even if it is a small amount, they quarter and dollar you) and the customization is minimal at best\n- Peasants are morons\n- Enemy AI has as much intelligence as my Mr. Coffee\n- Units have a tendency to just up and disappear\n- More bugs than a Zerg Swarm\n\nBottomline:  The game is getting older and older and not getting any better.

The devs seem keen on taking suggestions and fixing bugs, but the base of the game is broken. Terrible UI, delayed commands, units not doing what they are supposed to, no interactive pve, broken pvp.\n\nYou get shown all these amazing battles you can fight with massive armies and awesome castles you can siege. You will not see this ingame.\n\nIn pvp: You will build a massive army and level them a bit only to see them destroyed in pvp by a single enemy dragon or wizard. A high level 60 dragon or wizard has the same army strenght as a fully deployed army but has many times the defense, attack and hp regeneration stats so your units will be hitting and shooting it in vain. The only way to counter is to recruit your own super monsters and you'll end up using just those.\n\nIn pve: Sure you can use a massive army to siege a city and lose half of them in the progress. Or... get a dragon and/or wizard as said above and decimate the enemy castle as they cannot kill your dragon. Its easy to see which is the better option.\n\nThis review will be voted as not helpful just as all the other negative reviews as the core players have been playing this game for years and are good friends with the mods/devs (who btw can and will abuse their power to restore units and ingame currency by just being nice to them) and are raging fan boys thats are just happy with 1v1 units fighting and thus destroying the idea behind this game.","January 26, 2014","false","19.7"," 42 of 59 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","42","59","0","0"

I cant. Like a lot of games it has a lot of potential. That is why I have followed it from the beta on and off. I would love a decent mmorts. The enthusiasm shown for it by the developers kept me checking in and believing everything would eventually turn out ok. Over three years after release and nearly a year on Steam. How is it now?\n\nOne year anniversary email Oct 2012 "After a disastrous beta and early release and severing ties with ex publisher 505 Games, our studio have finally gotten a chance to make Dawn of Fantasy the game we always wanted."\n\n(edited for relevance/space) Apr 2013 email "We have an ambitious plan to get rid of the last remaining issues by May 1st and so that we can switch to adding awesome new features.\nHere's a brief overview of the top problems we solved in the past couple of weeks\n\nServer stability resolved - no more server downtime\nFixed lost progress, lost unit and army rollback issues\nPvP, Siege and Coop does not Out of Sync or Disconnect\nFixed the quest, Co-Op and PvP victory problems\nStarted the UI redesign and replaced some fonts\n\nIf you left the game because you had any of the problems above, now is the time to come back and give Dawn of Fantasy: Kingdom Wars another go."\n\nLooking at what is there right now it feels extremely buggy, poorly designed, implemented and unfinished.\n\nLosing units (mods will reimburse, with logs), crashing during battles (lose incurred on profile), lag during coop battles (rubberbanding), Syncing issues during pvp. Unit stances and behaviours not sticking, Unit commands not being followed. Very annoying voice spam messages and popups (deleting a voice file solved one, the mods responded they would look into the other) Resource system not working. I could go on and on.\n\nIts a real shame as the Homeland building aspects I really enjoy, enticing me to log back in and check on the little fellas regularly. The rest is, quite frankly, and I hate to say it, crap.\n\nThe ui is poorly designed. It feels like it is trying to fight me on what I am trying to do at times. Not showing all my units when I select all peasants (I believe there is a cap of 18 units selected which does not help you find that one unit you want to garrison) Hiding units in single man stacks behind a wall with no way to find them in a timely manner as the onscreen indicators are poor, Elements of the ui requesting you to look at them (quest book and invite friend button thing) flashing repeatedly until I click recognition and then flashing again a few minutes later repeatedly. I read my goddam quests the first time! Gaahhhhhh! Its like a facebook game!\n\nYou have a world map where the "mmo" takes place. This consists of a static map which is nice enough. You will never see another player on this map. This map is for you, To meet (fight) other players you move around declaring your looking for pvp and hoping that the area you are in has someone there. The system will tell you when a match is found. So its more like a lobby in the multiplayer sense. With an unnecessary visual element. The map for single player contains npc towns which you can visit(very rudimentary diplomacy), siege(coop or single) and visit for quests/selling/buying/trainging. It all just feels tacked on and has done since the beginning.\n\nI feel like I have been harsh in writing this but I feel it has had more than enough time to be in a decent playable state. Right now I feel nervous carrying out actions. I feel increasingly nervous the longer sieges go on in case of crash/loss. I fear sieges, not because of players but because of desyncing. I feel nervous upon logging in to find any units missing.\n\nThe positives of the game are grossly overshadowed by the problems. Of note is the nice way of earning the currency (crowns) ingame. The initial period, base building in your home instance. The fact they kept my account and it was available to me from steam after a long absence. Friendly dev interaction,\n\nDespite all that I will probably still log in to check on my little homeland every now and then. Quickly mind you, before the immunity timer wears out.\n\nI will continually update the review as changes occur. I will happily change the recommendation if its deserving. In march apparently big changes are happening. We shall see. Unfortunately I have heard that many times before.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","February 5, 2015","false","37.4"," 96 of 155 people (62%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","62","96","155","6","3"

Once you build your base, you build armies that are also PERSISTENT. So everytime you login, your base and armies are there from the last time you played and they're ready to battle.\n\nEach faction(humans, elves, orcs, +more to come...) are unique in every way. They gather resources(gold/food/wood/stone) differently. They have different units with different abilities and formations. They even have subfactions(3 subfactions per race) that make them even MORE unique by increasing/decreasing unit stats, economy, build times, etc.  Then you choose two traits from 5 or 6 options that further customize your experience with more stat boosts and whatnot.\n\nOnce you've built a base, done a few quests, and trained a decent army you can either conquer the AI controlled cities(either solo or Coop with someone) or search for another player's army to fight or siege their town. The Player vs Player fights are matched up according to the strength of your army, which prevents powerful veterans from picking on new players(or vice versa depending on how good you are :D ).\n\nThe best part is that anything can be earned by playing the game, except for a few items that are purely cosmetic and don't affect actual gameplay or mechanics.\n\nPROS:\n-Game Moderators are easily accessible and available for questions\n\n-Wizards, dragons, minotaurs, treants, hydras....that's right, HYDRAS!!\n\n-units level up and can be customized to your playstyle by spending skill points to increase health, stamina, attack, resistances, range, reload time, etc.\n\n-better than average graphics considering the size and scope of the game\n\n-massive battles with unlimited tactical possibilities where terrain, weather, and NPC patrols/camps are all factors\n\nCONS:\n-some minor bugs/issues, but the developers have released more patches to address bugs in the past two weeks than in the past year, so they're committed to keeping the game running smoothly now that it's free to play.\n\n-high system requirements to run the game even on low settings\n\n-some parts are difficult to learn to play early on because tooltips and tutorials aren't very helpful, but the community of players and the moderators are great about helping out\n\n\nBasically, you have nothing to lose except maybe a little time and hard drive space.

An MMO, RPG? Its an RTS, and a pretty well done one. The whole free-to-play is actually that, but they added a twist that i actually thought as something a whole lot better than the other ones out there that "need energy to complete actions, come back tomorrow". This has that ideal, but they did it in a way that keeps people entertained. You set some units to gather resources, and they gather small amounts over time, more units, more resources brought in. The best part though, is that you can constantly play, without having to check back up on your kingdom every few hours. You can create an army relatively quickly, and go out and fight (have not reached parts like that, just doing a quest to attack goblins at this point). This is when the RTS main fighting starts, though i should mention the home city is set up the same way, RTS style. This game is pretty fun, and i cant wait to either siege a castle, or get sieged. Im realy looking forward to the co-op battles.\n\nJust 5 hours in this game and i already love it, it has an excellent RTS-RPG mix, and i cant wait until i experience multiplayer.

Do not make a camp, thieves will slowly steal your money if u make a camp.\n\nWHen u lvl your swordsman you get at least 6-8 time to improve the skills of your swordsmen Improve the heal rate to 2 and improve all your resistance to impact to max.\n\nAfter that Highlight your army and your warden to num. 1 and num. 2, Go kill all the ogres and make your wardens loot the dead bodies of the ogres, (You have a chance to tame an Ogre) Male wardens got special abilities, they can instantly lot dead bodies, AND! Turn the resources to gold.\n\nA dead ogre has at least 100-700 meat that means, at least 1 dead ogre can make you get 100-700 gold (beware of the Ogre scouts, when u looted 1 ogre camp make sure, always guard your wardens because ogres camps have dead bodies and ogres can literally smash your wardens and watch out for Ogres scouts, 1 try can get you at least 15-25 k of gold at at least 16-20 ogres, if u try at least 9 times you can get 300k of gold and if u want to turn them to resources you will need market in your base and transfer the money you collected form ogres to your own base and turn them into some resources from the market.\n\nI think this will help you alot, but sometimes its boring but it can lvl your swordsmen fast, (At least 16 lvl for your troops in one try ), (Warning. Do not bring archers with your swordmen because almost all the time ogres targets archers and other ranged units).\n\nI hope I helped anyone thank you for reading all of that XD :D\n~peace","May 2","true","101.3"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","21","27","0","0"

Still we all had high hopes and knew there was something special there. So the Devs still apart of development that cared about the game and wanted to see it grow, ended up ended up taking care of it out of their own pocket over the past year and a half just worked mostly for free, using the what ever means, any current sales to invest into better servers or pay for outsourcing some fixes here and there and now they released a new version on steam with many new features and updates that fixed a ton of the game making it a lot better than its first official launch.\n\nIn the end, The game is very addicting, I have 4 cities, and massive armies, sure theirs many issues and bugs and sometimes horrible path finding, and pvp doesn’t always work, yes there has been major crashes but only because the game has grown so fast, there was none of these issues before, but the community and gameplay is just so rewarding I can't stop.So glad I’m done with this review, Already 70hrs in and all I want is more!

The economy side of the game is interesting and well thought out, the unit selection is acceptable. The idea of sieging and the length sieges can take when you aren't using armies of fully levelled crown store units is also fun (we can get to that later).\n\nThe game does have the potential to be really good, there's no disputing that, but please note kingdom wars is basically a name and an expansion - this game has been in development since 2011 and if you pair that with its current state, you may have some worrying thoughts of the direction the game is taking.\n\nOne of the biggest gameplay flaws in this, is basically the crown store - unlike other games where your armies are limited to the amount of epic units you can have - this game isn't. You can make entire armies of the most powerful crown store units in the game, level them freely and just annihilate any city within <30 minutes to farm even more crowns. These can then be used in PVP if you wish to do so.\n\nPVP - Basically we have a strength system here - if your PVP protection is down you can basically be attacked by player armies that are in the current area. The system isn't well balanced, for instance you could have an army of fully levelled regular units which can then be attacked and killed by a far smaller army of one or more fully levelled crown store units - this means you can essentially lose an entire army to a few units of crown store elites.\n\nThen we go onto the bugs I started to get plagued by, for instance each time I loaded into my cities I found my resources half wiped, when loading out from areas I'd have my resources completely wiped.\n\nThe gameplay is buggy, the path finding on units is atrociously bad (they can easily get themselves killed, so you can't really command them to go one way then quickly go to manage other units elsewhere, since they'll likely get themselves killed with their own poor path finding.\n\nYou can use the forums for this game for help, but help isn't really what you see there. If you look at the development logs, you see such silly developments and changes like prices of units etc - when this game has serious fundamental core game flaws, a game that calls itself an MMO, but can't even keep your data secure.\n\nThey use community volunteers as mods, since they can't afford to actually employ objective people that will provide you with proper service. I think anyone reading this can agree that community volunteers should be kept to forums at most, and not given any sort of power within a game environment at all - you don't see this logic applied here.\n\nAlso, something that really irks me when I was scouring the forum where the mods/devs do actively post on this game was the way they kept saying "this rare bug" this seemed like some sort've half hearted euphemism that i've never seen any development companies say. If you're experiencing crippling bugs, you don't want to be told it's rare and of low importance - you want to be told it's going to be dealt with asap.\n\nMy view of this game is essentially - could be something amazing and it could be something different. I just think the developers are either too young, or too new to their field of expertise and this has just been a mammoth undertaking that they haven't taken up with enough maturity and focus. With some proper direction, and better management in regard to the games running, perhaps that could change.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who has a strong chin and can put up with some of the annoyances I mentioned above in regard to the bugs, perhaps some of you can see a game that's been out there for this period of time with such core game issues and still enjoy it.\n\nFor those who are looking for a casual game you can play without any issues, I don't recommend this game in the slightest.","March 1, 2014","false","87.9"," 35 of 55 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","35","55","0","0"

This game, has great potential. It really does. The developers of this game really do care about this game.\n\nHowever with that being said, this game is a bug-glitch ridden mess that is holding hands along side a microtransaction system, That offers cosmetcs, and also "preminum" accounts, booster, etc. You name this game has it on the microtransaction side. This is not how you do microtransaction, btw. It's either one or the other, not both. Doing both may or may not work. In this case it doesn't work, in terms of concept and execution.\n\nThey shove it right in your face the whole nine yards, "Hey tell your friends about us!". Yup, i mean all of our friends play videogames, i mean yeah ALL of our friends...... >.> not only that but this game randomly encourages you to do so, and also suggest to sign up, and god knows what else. Anything to get their game more attention and care, and also $$$$\n\nSince gathering resources might take awhile, and you might need the few extra crowns (which by the way can be obtained through quests, or *ding, ding* you guess it. BOOSTER PACKS! :D) expect to not be stocked up for a long while. But even then the proccess is really, really, slow. Unless you have upgrades and you communicate with the community.\n\nIt just isn't the microtransaction system that is also plauging this game, but like what i previously stated before, this game is a bug-glitch ridden mess. The army's AI is chidlish, making illogical decisions that baffles you, plus the "co-op" system in this game is a complete joke, no lobby, but through a random selection of players or friends that, and oh by the way they must meet certain requirements in order for you to play with them. So if you are X, 1, 2 & 3 and your friends are, Y, 4,5,6 guess what? can't do it! Must be on the same page. But even then the game's cp-op system is still broken. the PVP has the same system, and runs just like the co-op system. You can tag team against players and what not.\n\nNow. How is the rest of the game?\n\nWell it's like Stronghold. You rule your own little "territory" in various landscapes, races, etc. All of which have their own set of skills, abilites, quest, etc. You can't customize your character, and if you want your character to have a name, must buy, buy, buy a renamer thingy in order to do it. In your terriotry, you see your land grow, however bewarn, upgrades require certain techs, large amount of resources may vary, and guess what? CROWNS! GLORIOUS CROWNS! :D\n\nAlso these "VIP" status buildings, and upgrades? They require an insane amount of supplies and CROWNS! so don't think getting to the top is going to fast and swift.\n\nYou can create alliances, but it costs......CROWNS! :D as Buzz Lightyear would say: "Crowns. Crowns, everywhere!". You must be invited by the clan leader in order to become part of the alliance, yup kiddes you have to make a ton of friends in this game if you want to be apart of it on a larger scale. The tutorial does it's best, but honestly, if you played Stronghold, and a Total war game, then it shouldn't be a bother.\n\nNow, unlike a Bethesda Game Studio game (Oblivion, Skyrim, etc.) there are no radient quests, the quests are given to you, so don't expect it to be quite fun. And unlike a Total War game, there is no real panic with the peasntry and such. Which would've been nice to have in this game, as it gives players an incentive to think about their territory first.\n\nThe lore is alright, i guess. For a medival game it does the job right.\n\nOne more thing, if you don't have a good rig. expect big performance issues, and even if you lower down the settings, the game still has weird performance issues, etc.\n\nSo in the end. Despite the patches, the issues are growing, and with this absurd and constant in your face "give us promotion" and also, buy, buy, buy! I recommend, NOT playing this game.","July 14, 2015","false","16.7"," 84 of 145 people (58%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","58","84","145","8","16"

Actually the second one is, but i havent been able to try it out yet  :( Feel free to gift it, ill love you long time jk lol.\n\nThis has a different approach to an RTS that most mmorts games miss. Its not a chess board with people everywhere trying to kill you, take your town, start over, etc. This game has a little bit of an offensive Ai and defensive Ai camps, towns, castles, and armies. All the while you are able to pvp with other players. Repair your towns when your attacked. etc. This game allows you to build. Allows you to have fun at your own pace. BUT make sure you go through the tutorials for orc and elves. They have their own style of play.  Which is also very intreging. (sp?)

If you're looking for an RTS that scratches both a persistent world MMO and an RTS to enjoy with friends, this is definitely it.

You can play offline single player modes but the online version is so easy for new players. To begin with this game is NOT "pay to win" it never really was but in the past about 2% of players shelled out the extra cash for some better units. Now there is NO cash shop. Instead you earn an extra type of currency called crowns by doing PVP. You can literally spend the first 24 hours of in game time just building up your city and levelling up units WITHOUT worryinging about being attacked. Your 12 hour immunity to attack BEGINS when you decide to build walls and you can hold off on the walls for 12 hours so you have a nice army and city ready to give any attackers a run for their money. The game matches you based on army strength so even when you do finally decide to PVP you will not be getting owned by players with much stronger armies, this is not the D-Bag gank festival that other PVP oriented games tend to be. Even when you do lose you still get a few crowns and your heroes do not die permanently nor are your buildings destroyed beyond repair! I am Namaste in game if you have any questions! there is tons of helpful posts in the steam forums to help get you started. It is the sort of game you can take your time with and play at your own pace!

Dawn of Fantasy looks and feels pretty "rough" but dont let that completely put you off from the game if you find it interesting. You choose from one of three races, then from one of three starting zones, you choose your heroes gender, and then name your city. Afterwards it should drop you into your tutorial. After the tutorial your loosed upon the world to build your forces and manage your city. Other than that I dont know how else to describe the game.

Let me start by saying this. I wanted a game that I could command large masses of troops to attack strongholds. After searching EVERYWHERE I found this. This game exactly fit my needs! Now I am going to let aside my desire for games like this for the rest of the review to keep it biased.\n\nIve been playing this game for about 80 hours now and I fell in love! I only have one friend that plays this so we usually attack together. The game is way more fun with friends! Now on to the things I need to explain.\n\nFirst if you don't care for the tutorials provided at the main menu you WILL be lost completely! I rushed straight to the game and couldnt figure out anything. Please Please do them. Next the Global chat and Disscusion page are needed! The in-game help is very minimal and you will have a lot of questions. Next this game has a lot of bugs!\n\nNow a lot of people say this game sucks because it crashes all the time and has slow battles. Do not believe them all. I can run this game at lowest graphics 50fps on my 3gb ram 1.2ghz laptop! When fighting large masses of people it is true that the frame rate drops. For me prop to about 3 or 4fps, I dont really care though because it picks back up after a few seconds.  Now on to the pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n1. Awesome Gameplay and Idea\n2. Great Potential\n3. Friendly Community\n4. Great graphics as a whole\n5. Good money system\n6. Very complex and soooo much to do\n7. Long Coop and Solo campaign\n8. Good rewards for fighting especially PvP rewards\n9. You can do everything in the game for free!\n10. Devs that are on the forums helping people out all the time!\n\nCons:\n1. Individual Model graphics (Mostly my fault for turning down quality from High to Very Low)\n2. Bugs\n3. Lack of tutorials and guides\n4. Not very easy for new players to begin (goes with con 3)\n5. On my bad laptop takes around 10 to get the game loaded to my city (Again my laptop is bad)\n\nFinally my over view\n\nThis game has grown a top from "Dawn of Fantasy" with new updates and bug fixes. I really enjoy this game and wish it does good in the future. I can spend hours a day on this game seiging new cities and taking territory. You can also do online coop quests with random people is you feel like it. It is Massively multiplayer and PvP! I hope whoever is reading this decides to download it and give it a try! I mean its Free! Cant get much better than that!

The game has some neat idea's and concepts, but just fails to deliver even basic RTS mechanics that have been the standard for quite a while now.\n\nThe controls are very poor and the response from units is very sluggish and half the time I tell them to do something they just plain don't do it or it takes the 5 seconds to actually start moving. None of the games mechanics are explained anywhere in the game and in a pvp game like this where you can be raided by other players this is a major fail by the developers.\n\nThe quest system is also very poor at explaining what you need to do. A lot of the quest I did I had to fumble my way through as the directions aren't very clear and there's again no explanation on how it's done. The quest will say go trade with this settlement for X resource and that's it, but in order to do that you have to go to your world map fumble around for a way to create an army that can move to other cites then deal with poor user interfaces to select things and finally do a trade.\n\nThe graphics are pretty lackluster as well, but I don't really hold that against a game as I focus more on gameplay.\n\nCombat is also a mess as you get large groups of units that are really one unit, but it has multiple small units that encompass it. These individual units can become spread out over a large distance sometimes which cause a lot of problems with organizing an army. Controlling units is some of the worst I've ever seen as there are no hotkeys for abilities or unit stances/formations and there is no quick way to know which units you have selected as again the UI is very poor and doesn't do a good job of clearly showing you what it needs to. You would think with all the units it would be cool in large battles to see them all fighting and stuff, but you would be wrong as they have no collision and will all stack up in small area's and at the same time they have collision with your units which makes them pathfind to where ever they want getting your units killed.\n\nOverall the game looks like and plays like it was designed for an iphone and it shows. The game is below average and I would say it's a 3/10 at best.","January 11, 2015","false","2.6"," 17 of 28 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","17","28","0","2"

DoF on the other hand, feels like what i always wanted an mmorts to feel like:  An RTS where my city persists in a world with oither peoples cities.\nI bought the game solely because of the dev's participation in the community, and discovered that the game is really good.\nThe content is really well thought out, especially the little things, like the types of units and their skills.  For example: archers have an 'enfillade' skill, which allows them to place spears  at their position.  Awesome.\nYou can have multiple cities, so one could play as Man, Elf, and Orc, without being locked into a decision.\nAgain, the little things, like the dialogue of the Orcs that really seem, well, orcish, and the Dialogue of the humans that have a real feudal feeling.\nThe Devs also have listened to the player based, which is refreshing.  The players didnt want the cash shop: they removed it.  The players didnt like griefing:  they made pvp protection easier to obtain.

All these issues have now been solved, however. With the free Arcana Expansion released, now is the perfect time to grab the game.\nA persistent online RTS, or MMORTS even. There's been only few attempts at these over the past decade, and each has had it's own values. But Dawn of Fantasy: Kingdom Wars stands out from the few in the genre. In a good way, that is. This is a game of pure quality, you can experience the love the developers put into the game first hand. Apart from the issues which have haunted this game, the core gameplay is sheer fun. Building up your small settlement into a mighty fortress while managing your armies, sieging massive pre-made strongholds, or just going out on a looting trip, no challenge is ever the same.\nWhile I have not played the game in quite awhile, I do remember there to be an in-game shop using premium currency. Nothing essential, but plenty of things which cannot be obtained otherwise, including the mighty Dragons. I am, however, quite sure you were able to gain premium currency ingame, which becomes considerably easier the stronger your economy gets.\n\nEdit: The cash shop has been revamped. The currency can no longer be bought but only earned in-game. As such there are no longer microtransactions possible, removing any P2W brand the game could possibly have had.\nThese devs are really responsive to the community and actually willing to change their model to such an extend. Kudos for that.","January 21, 2014","true","25.1"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

I understand their are still bugs that need to be worked out, but the progress made thus far are impressive and I can't wait to see what the game holds for the future.\nRecommendations: 1. Incorperate something to the alliance portion to make your own empire seem that more impressive. IE, more costumization pertaining to your clan. visual asspects that other players can see and say "Yep, that alliance is awesome", or "How can we get that?\n2. Incorperate add on's to own castles. This will make each castle feel more of thier own deisgn and help players create more tatics for deffense. But make small add on's with a variety of dessions to work with. some you can earn and speacial ones only given by ether successfully defending your castle a certian number of times or completing certain missions.

Combat is very micro managy (or it can be) which can be both a good thing and a bad thing. Although, I've found myself spending most of my time so far watching my hunters hunt while I wait for buildings to build. Still a very fun and in depth game.\nPro's:\n+In depth and micro managable combat if you want to, click and swarm units if you don't want to micro.*\n+Fleshed out races with personalities.\n+Great soundtrack.\n+Fun animations and ai things to keep you entertained while things build.\n+Customizable city lay outs (for the orcs anyway, not sure about other races).\n+Good variety of units and upgrades.\n+Good PvP.\n+Very in depth lore that gives you a good feel for the world.\nCon's:\n-Buildings can take a very long time to build (as in a few hours real time).\n-Skirmish mode has to be bought.\n-Can be very dull at times.\n-Most of the quest dialog is text only, but there are still fun unit battlecries.\n-Graphics are about on par with Warcraft 3 (but then again, it's just as enjoyable).\n\nOverall, I recommend this game as a fun strategy game to play as a relaxing "watch your city grow" type of game. Especially now that it's only $4.99 USD.\n8/10\n\n*EDIT:\nThis has recently come to my attention (I didn't really get into much combat earlier and I'm just now really finding out about this): Unit AI. The unit AI is really buggy and they will randomly stop attacking, run the other way, attack things you didn't want them to, and are hard to control. I still recommend this game, but just be aware of this if you buy it (or downloard it I suppose since it's now free to play).","September 25, 2014","true","42.0"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

Would recommend this for anyone who likes rts/rpg games, especially for those who like knight's and fantasy settings. One good part is, that u can play it as a single player game if u want, and theres still alot of things to do.\n\nPvp is a bit odd part, but the way it was implemented when i last played, was pretty nice imo. U dont have to accept battle if someone attacks you, and if u dont, he will get about 90% of the resources ur army/city is carrying, but only that army wich was challenged. And after each fight, even if you "pay out", ull get battle protection. Who can attack who, is defined by army strenght, wich was pretty well made last time i played. Strong units (special units like dragons and wizards) will pump up ur army strenght pretty fast, especially if they are high levels. Tho there may be some combinations that allow ppl easy wins with low army strenght, but those are only against some particular army strenght, so if its possible, its very minimal.","August 12, 2015","true","128.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Turns out that my email ended up in their spam-filter.. x) ... ok, fair enough I guess, small indie company - in a busy time as well.\n\nBut once the support did find out, namely the moderator Zane, in a matter of a few hours of personal support with the tools he had available I was up to close to where I was after 200+ hours of gameplay and a few hundred dollars.. since I did get a little bit of some of the stuff that wasn't even out back in 2013.

Building massive armies, freedom to build and share you'r own maps and features. Helpful people always offering to give tips. decisive live strategy battles. laying waste to everything from small bandit camps to entire empires through massive seiges. The game is a bit finnicky and i have found a few bugs myself, but if  you are able of basic thought the game is easy to pick up but difficult to master. Including a lot of micromanaging and sort of planning economic success and quick decision making skills aren't required, but they are recommended. But all things can be learned in time. So on behalf of my word, try the game out, and i mean really try it. you can tell that alot of work was put into this game, and it deserves quite a bit of gratitude for it.","April 30","true","26.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I am happy about that. This is the only MMORTS game I could find that is actually 3d with micro managing. I did end up buying it due to the sale of 4.99$. my first thoughts where I wish the graphics were better but when I got a feel how the mechanics of the game works i lost interest ing the graphics and found it has allot of in depth stragety with city managment to build a strong economy. I suggest players to pay attention to the in game quests and everything will come together. I dont have much more to say being I only have been playing for a few hours but so far I am happy. if you go to the community page you will see the developers are very active and doing there best to get this game to last by listening to the players.","January 23, 2014","true","38.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

The time I have spent on this game alone should speak for my overwhelming reccomendation of this game. What I still can't believe is that this game truely is Free To Play, and NOT Pay To Win. Anybody can pick up this game without spending a cent and find themselves ruling the battlefield. All it takes is a little knowledge of the economics of the game, and some good old fashion battle Skillz. This review will hopefully outline some of the awesome features included in this game, all so you, the reader, can finally jump into Kingdom Wars and finally expierence the MMORTS that is Kingdom Wars for yourself!\n\nFirst off, a look at the battles! What can I say except that they are truely an epic experience. The game includes battle matchmaking service that ensures you aren't being attacked, or can attack, other players outside of your own Army size and expierence. This ensures that veteran players can't simply prey on the weak newbies to the game. This is awesome as it ensures players don't often shy away from battles, and continually work on their own strategies and skills through first hand expierence. When you finally dawn that Army backed up with a royal dragon, and march to the front gates of an enemy, I guarentee your heart will skip a beat as they fly in wreaking burning havoc on the field.\n\nIn addition to the gratification you will get from some PvP battle, there are countless PvE battles awaiting you in this game. The map is filled with other PvE castles and towns that are available to attack. In addition, after winning any of these battles you will have the option to loot them for Crowns, OR make them your own vassal, increasing your resource collection rate, and allowing you to recruit troops outside your own race.\n\nFor those looking for a solid economic simulation, rest assured, you can find that in Kingdom Wars. A lot of the micromanaging has been eliminated from the simulation mode by adding the ability to select your workers and assign them tasks from their menu bar. This works GREAT in battle especially, as when fires break out during a seige you can simply click on the peasant and assign them to fire fighting, and off they go douse the flame preventing further damage. For those that enjoy the micro managing part of this, you can still individually click on your workers and send them to specific duties still.\n\nWorkers duties don't just stop at your city. You can also establish work camps throughout your region, filling them with workers assigned to tasks on the map, such as wood cutting, gold mining, ore mining, and farming. Managing these camps is even simpler, all it requires is some simple clicking through an economics screen that lets you add workers or subtract them to tasks. This tool is also used at cities that have become your vassal, but in addition, have the ability to setup trade routes to other cities, further expanding your resource gathering.\n\nMy favorite part so far with the game has actually been the fact I started playing prior to Halloween and was pleasantly surprised to see that the game gets so much developer attention they released a Halloween package that included an "Eternal Night" for the holiday.\n\nI could truely go on and on about the many features this game includes, but every minute I spend typing this review I feel my anxiety increasing from being away from my own game. That all being said it should be mentioned that there are some minor issues with the game still. On a couple occassions it has froze while loading a PvP battle, and I have found some resources missing a time or two. However, their is nearly always an Moderator or Developer on whom is ready to issist and remedy these issues. I am stunned by how much the developer team cares to ensure a solid game play expierence. In addition, it doesn't matter if you have purchased premium content or not, the DEV team still give you amazing service in navigating a small hiccup here or there. Plus, with nearly daily updates to the game, these small problems are quickly dissapearing.\n\nAfter playing a dozen or so "Free To Play" games and always being dissapointed in how much an advantage players who purchased premium content would have over others, I am simply in bliss finally finding a game where the broke the college student could come on and have an enjoyable escape without forking over their tuition money in order to do so...","November 2, 2014","true","148.1"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dwarfurious/recommended/227180/","Dwarfurious","Dwarfurious","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dwarfurious/","226 products in account","Online Empire Simulator, thats what i call the Genre, maybe you call it something else, but its been around for a long long time. Maybe you started in Tribal Wars/Travian, or noticed those Evony ads everywhere. I think my first was Astro Wars in 2002, (its still up) and countless more since then. For many people, the combat might of ruined the game for them, for almost all of these games use automated combat, you send an army and you win or lose.\n\nSome games of this genre tried to improve on that, offering tactical deph in way of army formations, eventually some games gave combat a manual mode, in turn based style; Heroes of Gaia and Forge of Empires for example. But we've all probably been waiting for a real RTS combat experience, and Kingdom Wars is the closest thing to getting it, and without walking for hours on an overworld.\n\nNaturally, merging these genres brings setbacks. Remember planetside 1? The first MMOFPS? Yeah, the actual gunplay sucked, but you played it because of the scale, you couldnt get that anywhere else, you put up with it. Kingdom Wars is in the same boat, stepping into new ground, the controls suffer for this and take getting used too. I dont view it as a MMORTS though, its an online empire simulator with RTS/RPG mechanics as its broken up into instances with icons to represent your army on the world map, a map shared by all players but in their own instance.\n\nHere's what you need to know you're getting into.\nYou pick a race, then customize it by choosing a specific region, then two of five perks.\nYour town is persistant, you train workers to gather instead of upgrading mines. It CAN be attacked, but not while you're offline.\nWhen you make troops, they shouldnt stay in your town, thats when you enter the world map and create an army.\nThe world map is full of NPC cities, these can be traded with, allied with, or dealt with. You cannot see other player cities or armies.\nThere is a long story and quest chain, almost like its a single player campaign in an online game, you'll be doing quests but they can be done in co-op too.\nYour city is relatively safe compared to other games of this genre, chances of being attacked are low and you cannot be attacked while offline or otherwise unavailable.\nWhile your city persistently generates resources all the time, actively playing the game is very rewarding since there is no stamina system holding you back from playing it all day, it does great at blending the Idle and Active aspects of both genres.\nYou cannot build extra cities like other Empire Simulators, you have a main city to grow, and other cities you conquer trickle rewards. You can unlock extra city slots in case you want to try other races or regions but these cities cannot interact.\n\nThe F2P element is very generous too, starting with Protection peroids that only count down while you're online, having multiple and efficient means of farming premium currency, and restricting PvP to armies of similar Strength, so you wont be fighting an army of powerful premium units without an army of equal strength on your side, and even if you lose, you still get Crowns, so dont shy away from a fight!\n\nIf you're just a RTS fan, this might not be for you, although there are unlockable Skirmish/Campaigns for solo play. But if you've ever enjoyed growing a persistant online empire then you have to check this out, I cant kill all the elves myself.","November 2, 2014","true","132.9"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","0"

Then no later than one hour out of player protection I was attacked by a very "STACKED" player, very POOR POOR Player vs Player balancing. Although I had played 20 hours, had a very decent sized army and defensive town (with stone walls) I was easily defeated by the attacker. My units were Level 10 to Lv 7 on average. All of the attacker units were Lv 20 that I could see. I had just built a Wizards tower and it would take another 120 crowns to build a Wizard, he already had one and it was fully leveled. I was not playing passsively, I played for a longtime building my base, fortifyinh it and building very decent army. Even so; as soon as Battle Protecttion ended I was crushed.\n\nI would not suggest anyone play this game unless you look for disapointment. I would relate this game to any other Facebook or CRAP Online game that requires a Pay to WIN requirement to pull ahead. If you wish to be attacked by Sadists who have money to burn on this game help yourself.\n\n20 hours in I was hugely dissapointed,had I been able to progress without Player vs Player it would have been just as enjoyable.\n\n...however I got the EFFIN CRAP beat out of me by a guy "vastly" out leveling me and 10 times my strength. It's really not a matter of "he did it better" it's a matter of allowing players vastly stronger to attack and crush any other player starting out no matter how strong he is. It took me sometime to get some of my units to level 11 but as I said he had units all at Lv20. I was smart enough to go out the backside of castle with two Level 10 Mounted Knight units and flanked his Wizard and supply trains. I took out all of his supply trains and pounded on the Wizard for 5 minutes of game time and NO DAMAGE to the wizard. Not point of dmage done to the wizard. In the meantime his wizard cast lightning bolts at my castle defenders and basically took out 50% of my troops al by himself.\n\nIf there is any game balance there you tell me.\n\nThe game was somewhat fun up until that attack. I stopped playing not because I'm a sore loser but because if any player 10 times your strength can come in and hammer you then there is just no getting ahead.","December 24, 2014","false","31.3"," 33 of 62 people (53%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","53","33","62","6","2"

It is free-to-playy, with a new and different free-to-play model. I wont tell any details, im sure you can find some. This game perfectly mixes fantasy and RTS with leveling of heroes and even the grunts can be upgraded. You have your basic grunts, y'kno, Swordsman, Pikemen, and Archers. Also, there are like 26 villages you can siege that vary in difficulty, and each has a different description and race, depending on the region. This game also allows you to PVP, and Co-Op NPC sieges. The resources are different and each race has a different strength when it comes to econ.

You can earn heroes and elite units buy generating gold and buying premium crowns or simply buying them with money, you will end up with a single army with a hero or two and several camps generating gold. The PvP will only include a hero setting fires to kill your non elite units and a hero that can solo any regular elite units, you will only have the option to counter a certain hero or just ending up co oping PvE sieges to gain crowns faster.\n\nI recommend simply clearing your home town map of quests and enemies then upgrading your resource gathering tools and start trading off extra resources you do not end up using on 2nd/3rd tier units. You want any upgrades that increase your gold income and you want to travel to neighboring towns and find which resource they pay for the most and setting up a camp nearby with that said resource. After you have three maxed camps set up generating resources set up another of all storage traveling units to trade and a single army of 25 2nd/3rd tier tanks, 25 2nd/3rd tier ranged DPS and either 9 town workers to gather resources off dead bodies or 5 of them and 4 storage traveling units. The last slot will be for either your starting hero or a crown bought one, leave your army out of your hometown so no one will attack it but if they do make sure to either have a single hero there or walls with long ranged dps mounts. Gold is key.\n\nSupport is weak as they run with a small team so wiki and check forums for any issues or wait for the newest Empire Expansion to come out.","March 24, 2014","true","60.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Dawn of Fantasy: Kingdom Wars is the first and ,as of writing this review, only 3D massively-multipleyer-online real-time-strategy game. At first glance, it seems as though these two characterizations could in no way combine together to form a fluent game that's fun to play. Dawn of Fantasy does this almost perfectly. The game takes place in a mideival era with elements inspired by fantasy. The game takes a healthy dose of inspiration from titles such as Age of Empires and Strongholds Legends while still remaining origional and unique. DoF is easy to pick up and play if you are experienced in the RTS genre, but can be challenging if this is your first strategy game. What makes the game unique is that it is in a persistent world that keeps on going even after you log off. while this may sound like a bad thing to you, it truly isn't. While you are away, you can't be attacked by other players and production of any units or construction of any building will not be halted. DoF manages itself well so you don't have to worry while you are away. The game's player-versus-player isn't overpowered either: you won't have to worry about being attacked by players with armies that could overthrow a galactic empire. Instead, you will only be faced against armies that match your own army with a slight 10% deviation. You also won't be attacked by anyone until you construct walls around your city, which isn't mandatory to continue playing the game but not having walls means that you can't play co-operatively with your friends.As soon as you do construct walls though, the game really gets into the most fun parts. As well as being attacked by enemies, you can team up with your friends and wage war against players and NPC's alike. With a game this amazing, you'd think that it would use microtransactions so players could pay-to-win. That is not the case in Kingdom Wars. As of January 10th, 2014 buying your way to victory with in-game currency has been disabled: meaning that the only way you can make money in the game is (Plot Twist!) to play it! I picked up this game for five dollars, but i'd gladly pay the full price for this game!\n","February 4, 2014","true","72.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There nothing in the game you can buy with real $$$$ that will help you in battle in pvp or pve. Every thing done with in game reasouces.\n-Customzation. If you download it in the free to play version. You can buy Custom hero looks and city buidling. So you can make the city and your hero fit more to how you like. Sadly the Custom look not free cost like 3 bucks but that is understandible snice the devs still need to make money. For the poeple who go the game before when is cost 20 bucks. Devs were cool, and fair to give us the Customs for free. Snice we already threw in 20.\n- RPG/RTS Mix. Game got a good mix for a rpg and rts. You have a hero that will lead your army and interact with quest. All units gain lvl with xp were you can increase there attack, hp, range ect. Unless your unit a hero they can die. So game make you think on to lvl your units and keep them alive to reach higher lvls for more powerful units.\n- Factions. Game have 3 factions with there own play style. They play a role for pve but for pvp their no down side. You can play humans and your freinds can be orcs or elfs.\n- Fair PVP. pvp set up goes threw army and city power. So you never have some one who has a army for example. 1000 power attack your army of 340 power. You can challange poeple with higher power army but you never have to worry about going up aginst some one who op as hell. Puting that down it goes to skills and army set up wins the battle.\n-Active dev team. Got to say I always see these guy on the fourms answering and fix issue and bugs in the game.\n\nCons.\n-Grapichs. Got to hit the basic.. Frist the citys and country side look great. But the Combat and units are not overly amazing.  (This can change in the Future.)\n- Sounds. The sounds over lay in the game not the best you hear some units fighting with sounds and some with out sounds.(Can change if devs work on it.)\n-Bugs. game still bugy. ya ya I know the devs are working on it still but Until it fix I leting poeple know game still got a few bugs.\nMore Imerrsions, more units more citys. I see stuff in the loading screen with ships and some town info talking about ships. There like 4 areas in the world map that are empty. You can go in them and fight pve still but there not much gain. Possible that it just intel for things to come later.\n\nOVERALL . I still recomend the game. It free to play now and you don't have to spend a dime in the market to get it full value of online game play.","September 22, 2014","true","198.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I think that the tactics systems are a little less than that memorable series, total war, but come astonishingly close for an F2P game. The graphics are OK, but then again it is a strategy game that is, well, not graphics focused. The buildings and crown system are very good, as the crowns are easily possessed unlike other games such as CoC or Star Trek Online, which are somewhat P2P and P2Win, though advertised otherwise. I think the game really emphasises equality among P2P and F2P players. This game is really geared towards those who like total war and want it in an MMO or cannot afford it. For those tactical masterminds who want to test their cavalry strategies against foolish mortal players, this is for you.","April 15, 2015","true","53.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

And the learning curve could be bypassed a tad more by providing longer resource-boosts throughout the beginning stages for newbies. God forbid they build 69 houses and wonder why they're broke. A more in-depth tutorial wouldn't hurt, either - but then again a good portion of players skip it with a yolo mindset. Their towns don't last long.\n\nAnyhow,\nThe graphics are fair, even on the Maximum setting(s).\nThe mechanics (movement) is somewhat clunky, and it takes a good bit for your soldiers/army to realize they've walked past the enemy. A few key commands take a while to register at times, but it could be server lag(?)\nResource accusition isn't unbearably slow, but it's nothing to hold your breath over; it's definitely a long term game.\n\nThis is more or less what the browser-based-strategy ♥♥♥♥♥♥mers wanted, BUT IN 3D!\n\nOverall, this game has DEFINITE potential to become something great.\n\n6/10 for now.

I feel like the items they do charge for (all of which are cosmetic) are over priced for many of them however it is early on. The game itself has the problem most MMO RTS have of slow resource gathering but unlike a lot of mmos the buildings themselves build fairly quickly.\n\nA BIG thing I have to give this game credit for is they did something I've never seen. MMO 'strategy' games frequently give a grace period (usually 24 hours) that you can't be attacked during. However the counter continues to count down even when you're not logged in. In Kingdom Wars the counter only goes down when you're LOGGED IN! Meaning if you need to take a break and let things farm in the background you can sign off and come back later without loosing that starting protection.","April 15, 2015","true","22.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

As a moderator for the game, I may be biased, but my knowledge and experience gives me the confidence to say that if you choose to download this game, you will not be sorry. However, there are still some bugs, one of the problems with using an old engine. Despite this, they have completely overhauled a majority of the original game, fixed the broken pathfinding, made the world conquerable with the addition of vassal cities, added alliances, and so many more features. All of these additions were free, and now that the game has gone F2P, there is no reason not to try it.","November 2, 2014","true","190.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It reminds me of Strong Hold, Age of Empires, and Total War all wrapped up into one; taking certain elements from each and using them to the in such a unique way that it is niether a copy of the games, nor is it a jumbled mess of all those favorite elements from those games.  The mechanics of the game are not at all difficult to learn, especially if you have experience in any of those games that I have listed above.\n\nOne of the best features, and the one that I most enjoy, is that the initial starting protection does not expire while you are offline.  So someone like me who has to spend 9+ hours a day working is not penalized for that.  The game also allows me to move at my own pace throughout the game; let me choose to explore, raid local areas, siege towns, and then pick up right where I left off.\n\nEven though I could continue on with game place itself, I want to take a moment to say that this game does not run hard on my computer.  I have maxed out the settings and it still moves flawlessly.  As a whole, the graphics are not top of the line, but they are naught bad either.\n\nI do not recommend many things, but when I do, it means that there is something decent about it.

It looked lke your standard Battle for Middle Earth/Civillization knockoff game, with none of the interesting storytelling, and all of the grind. It plays well enough, with no truly devastating glitches that I know of yet, but there was one thing that made me stop playing. Before I get to that thing, let me explain some of the pros and cons of the game:\n\nAs I've said before, it's like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mix between LOTR: Battle for Middle Earth and Civilization, with both Real Time Strategy elements and that good old fashioned resource management component to give it a realistic hue. You kind of get tossed into the game with no proper training, and the beginning of the game, as a result, can be a pain in the ♥♥♥. Thankfully, you get an awesome amount of Battle Protection, which keep the PVP hawks off of you until you can set up a decent and defensible foundation. There are four main resources: wood, food, stone, and gold, and a fifth pseudo-resource called Influence, or Crowns. Crowns are not important when you're getting your basics down for your town, but later on, they will become a very valuable resource that will become frustrating for you to acquire, since they mostly are acquired via quests of PVP. Luckily, however, you can convert gold to crowns, and if you're good at resource management, then it shouldn't be too much of a pain in the ♥♥♥ to handle. Getting the controls down isn't exactly a synch, but it isn't impossible to nag down, if you're experienced with RTS games.\n\nThe game's story are lore are unimaginative and yawn inducing, with the generic, Tolkien esque knockoff vibes stemming from the three main factions: The Humans, the Elves, and the Orcs/Goblins. The dialogue is badly written, with some of the texts even bleeding off the boxes they are cramped into. The way the dialogue is written, it feels like the writers are trying to copy off ye olde engrish ways of writing, where every word and sentence is a headache to put together and understand in your head. Even if you do manage to finish translating the drek, it's all this very generic lore, with the elves and their nature and magic, the orcs with their war and tribal mentality, and the humans with their... Human ♥♥♥♥, I guess... There's obvious betrayals, with obvious setups for war and bloodshed, and the whole campaign is just there for filler, so the antisocial ♥♥♥♥s can feel like they're playing the game while the PVP nuts hash it out with each other.\n\nNow I'll admit it: the gameplay is riddled with dozens of little gems that made me keep wanting to play the game. You had a versatile unit structure (at least with the humans), that allowed for different approaches to siege and warfare. You can fight to defend your stronghold, you can fight to siee someone else's stronghold, and you can just get your army out on a field and hash another army's brains out for all you care. It's a nice, versatile game structure that allows for a lot of possibility. The problems crop up when it comes to controls and the AI itself, and this is where the story of why I stopped playing begins:\n\nI was set up as the Human faction, with a nice little stronghold on a hill in the mountains. I had set up everything I needed and didn't need, including a few mercenary workers from both the orc and dwarven lands to work in my mines when I needed them to. I had my peasants fully upgraded and able to handle and gather any resource I needed within minutes. I had an army with knights, mounted knights, cavaliers, and archers, all battle hardened and toughened up wth the scars and calluses from the many grind battles I did on account of Sir Lentoth. I had several dozen catapults primed and ready for a siege, with enough stone to last me several hours, if need be, and both my archers and catapults had the flame upgrade to give me a boost when I had to inevitably shoot the enemies down within their own walls. I was ready for my first major siege, and I was admittedly kind of pumped.\n\nI scouted the elven regions, looking for the smallest city to start on. I knew I wasn't ready for the big times yet, and that I needed to start small, so I didn't bite off more than I could chew. I picked out some ♥♥♥♥ery named city att eh top hand corncer of the closest elven region with the "Very Easy" tag written into the description. I said, "♥♥♥♥ it, why not?" and sent my army there. I started the siege, and found myself doing pretty well, going back and forth with my archers to and from the stronghold, taking out as many as they could before they died, bringing them back, and using my knights and hero to heal them up, and prime them for the next wave. The enemy reserve timer hits zero, their reinforcements come, and at the cost of all of my melee units, I take out the calvary they sent after me. I had 20 archers, my hero, and 9 catapults after that wave. I managed to take out the city's archers, and were using my archers to take out as many within the wall before my catapults took down the gateway. I had my hero healing them up as best as he knew how, and the process still worked, until I finally cracked through the walls.\n\nI expected to lose quite a few men once the walls came down, my archers could only reach so far, within the city, after all, and there were plenty of melee units left that were capable of taking me down if I wasn't careful. Problem is, I was careful. I knew my strengths and knew my weaknesses, and I used that to my advantage. I brought my archers in and used them to slaughter all but a few of the units in the city. At that point I decided to make a retreat to reheal and regather my strength. But there was a glitch in the game, a minor flaw concerning the AI. I had 20 archer units, mind you, and I had taken out all of the units, save for a few stragglers that were on their own. Nevertheless, I needed to heal, because something was off with the archers' targeting. My hero wasn't doing any killing, and ended up getting himself killed right at the gate. My archers were killing most of the enemy units, save for a lone mounted unit that they just couldn't hit. Let me reiterate, the archers were firing at the horseman, and were hitting him, but he wasn't taking any damage. He was the enemy that followed my units back to camp as they retreated, I tried firing, repositioning, and refiring once again, but this guy simply would not ♥♥♥♥ing die. His comerades died, the rest of his unit apparently died too, but he wouldn't ♥♥♥♥ing die, and wouldn't even get a scratch on him, regardless of the fact that I had 20 archers with flame arrows attacking him. He eneded up following my guys back to camps, killing them one by one, It was then thhat I realized that because of this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I couldn't get into the city for long enough to win the battle, so I withdrew and sent my army home.\n\nMaybe there was a technicality here, maybe the unit was a special one, he did have the "Mounted Grandmaster" title on him, after all. But that technicality cost me a battle,cost me my resources, and cost me my energy and time. I'm officially done with this ♥♥♥♥ing game, and I can't stand to see it on my desktop anymore. The minor glitches I could handle. the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ storytelling and grindy nature I could tolerate. The painstakingly slow travel speeds of the armies across the continent I could tolerate while reading a book or setting up my town some more. But this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, this glitchy, unpredictable ♥♥♥♥over was the straw that broke the camel's back.\n\nIt's a free game, it's a 3D game, and it's playable until you start to do something important. So waste your time here if you want, I'm ♥♥♥♥ing done with this ♥♥♥♥.\n\n","May 20","false","56.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The ability to co-op seige npc towns to gain bonus resources and crowns (used for upgrading technologies, and advanced units) is remarkable.\n\nCombat system - Each group of soldiers has a number of units inside it, and as long as 1 lives the entire group can be healed. The abilities of each group of soldiers also come with abilities which help in the midst of battle, some are more defensive abilities while others can deal heavy damage or movement speed in tough situations. In all the combat is well rounded with units that counter other units, and ways to win if strategically done.\n\nBuilding and Resources - This game is not a win in 1 day game, it takes patients and time to succeed into being a king. The resource gathering is per minute, which draws the building out but is worth it. During the time it takes to raise walls and gather resources for other builds you can spend time doing the Unlimited quests in the game for Crowns (In-game currency). Each building takes time, but you can build it all at once if you have the resources for it, or if you become impatient on a nessecary building you can rush the build with Crowns.\n\nQuesting - The game has unlimited quests, this gives you a never-ending pve aspect to a largely pvp game. From Quests you recieve Crowns, and/ Resources. Some quests are very challenging but with co-op quests it notifies you that you can get assistance doing the quest (either from a random player, or from a friend off of your friendslist).\n\nPVE - I enjoy the pve the most. The battles in each of the zones is different, elvens fought in elven zones, humans in human zones, and orc's in the orc zones. Beyond that there are zones not allocated to a race. These zones have harder creatures to fight like orges (a unit of the orc's but the entire zone is ogre's), Dwarfs (a style of unit bought with crowns), goblins (another unit of the orc's but the entire zone is goblins), and even an extremely hard zone of Dragons!\n\nPVP - The pvp is setup as matchmaking, you will never fight someone much bigger then your army/town and you will never be able to pick on the weak. Its balanced so that you can enjoy fighting without the fear of being slaughtered. If you choose not to fight a player who is trying to fight you then you can do a "payout" option and sacrifice some resources or a few units to not have to battle them and it allows you to return to what you what to do (Quest, farm, pve, etc).\n\nNot pay to win - I want to state that in no way is this a pay to win game. There is options for buying packages, and being a Premium account but it gives only crowns, resources, and a bonus daily reward for premium accounts. These are all things you can aquire very easily in game but by buying a package you are not spending 30+ minutes gathering the resources or farming the crowns. Buying premium not only saves you time gathering crowns, it also helps the game grow and gives incentive to play. As a closing statement to this i will repeat - Its not pay to win, its free to play. Buying only helps you grow faster and helps the game grow faster.\n\nIn all I must recommend this game to anyone who enjoys RTS games, this breaks the mold of what RTS use to be and brings a new light on the future of RTS. I have enjoyed every aspect of the game and hope to see more content in the future.","October 30, 2014","true","137.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

The ability to co-op seige npc towns to gain bonus resources and crowns (used for upgrading technologies, and advanced units) is remarkable.\n\nCombat system - Each group of soldiers has a number of units inside it, and as long as 1 lives the entire group can be healed. The abilities of each group of soldiers also come with abilities which help in the midst of battle, some are more defensive abilities while others can deal heavy damage or movement speed in tough situations. In all the combat is well rounded with units that counter other units, and ways to win if strategically done.\n\nBuilding and Resources - This game is not a win in 1 day game, it takes patients and time to succeed into being a king. The resource gathering is per minute, which draws the building out but is worth it. During the time it takes to raise walls and gather resources for other builds you can spend time doing the Unlimited quests in the game for Crowns (In-game currency). Each building takes time, but you can build it all at once if you have the resources for it, or if you become impatient on a nessecary building you can rush the build with Crowns.\n\nQuesting - The game has unlimited quests, this gives you a never-ending pve aspect to a largely pvp game. From Quests you recieve Crowns, and/ Resources. Some quests are very challenging but with co-op quests it notifies you that you can get assistance doing the quest (either from a random player, or from a friend off of your friendslist).\n\nPVE - I enjoy the pve the most. The battles in each of the zones is different, elvens fought in elven zones, humans in human zones, and orc's in the orc zones. Beyond that there are zones not allocated to a race. These zones have harder creatures to fight like orges (a unit of the orc's but the entire zone is ogre's), Dwarfs (a style of unit bought with crowns), goblins (another unit of the orc's but the entire zone is goblins), and even an extremely hard zone of Dragons!\n\nPVP - The pvp is setup as matchmaking, you will never fight someone much bigger then your army/town and you will never be able to pick on the weak. Its balanced so that you can enjoy fighting without the fear of being slaughtered. If you choose not to fight a player who is trying to fight you then you can do a "payout" option and sacrifice some resources or a few units to not have to battle them and it allows you to return to what you what to do (Quest, farm, pve, etc).\n\nNot pay to win - I want to state that in no way is this a pay to win game. There is options for buying packages, and being a Premium account but it gives only crowns, resources, and a bonus daily reward for premium accounts. These are all things you can aquire very easily in game but by buying a package you are not spending 30+ minutes gathering the resources or farming the crowns. Buying premium not only saves you time gathering crowns, it also helps the game grow and gives incentive to play. As a closing statement to this i will repeat - Its not pay to win, its free to play. Buying only helps you grow faster and helps the game grow faster.\n\nIn all I must recommend this game to anyone who enjoys RTS games, this breaks the mold of what RTS use to be and brings a new light on the future of RTS. I have enjoyed every aspect of the game and hope to see more content in the future.","October 30, 2014","true","137.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Keep in mind that this is my first review.\n\nThe bad: You cannot manuelly place buildings, they are all automatic. If you're hoping to leave your workers to gain resources for you while your offline then you'll be terribly mistaken, while offline you gain 50% less resources than you did before. The game is terribly buggy, Some units walk across the sky in sieges, some walk over mountains and the pathfinding is not that great. The AI are some of the worse I've ever seen; While doing a custom siege I sent my reinforcements to attack the army that was besieging me and after they killed my reinforcements what did they do? they stood there for the next 45 mins doing nothing when my castle was rype for the taking. Some of your troops wont attack certain troops when they're standing right in front of them unless you right click on them to attack. The game also has a terrible learning curve and you will ofen get bored playing this game. You WILL spend most of your time in the world map traveling between cities and to new strongholds to attack. Also when starting off in southmont players can attack your townhall from outside your double layered walls and immediately win the battle since battles are won by destroying the town hall, not the army nor the city. The town hall. Mods are also usually never on, I've never seen one on anyways or one that would actaully do something productive and help players.\n\nThe good: PVP is fun. Sieges are fun and battles in general are fun. The storylines are decent. Though you cannot manuelly place buildings it is always nice to finish your city and admire its beauty. Theres also a nice little shop that you can spend crowns on to get special units or more resources. Crowns can be rewarded to you through attacking other players or doing quests or by buying them. You also require crowns to build walls.\n\nI played 12 hours into this game, so before you haters say I didn't play the game enough then think again. I played 12 hours into this game and i listed all the things i could think of and most of those things are bad. This game may be for some but it's not for everyone. If you can get past all the things listed above then this game might just be for you. 5/10.

This game is an ''Open-World'' RTS with RPG Elements here and there, with a great execution on Mass-Battles it can be kind of unbalanced here and there, in PvP for example if you have a highly trained army of 25 people you will be easily killed by a weak army of 10 units. The game still requires alot of scaling in many different aspects but the developer team which by the way exists out of only four people who are working very hard to provide you the best possible RTS game they can make out of this.\n\nGameplay,\nthe gameplay aspect of this game is still wonky and outbalanced by bugs or mistakes in the ''Scaling'' system but overall it is still a solid part of this game and most ''Hardcore-RTS'' players will be able to look past it. This game is  not very competitive because of a simple mechanic called: Battle protection. It allows you to not get attacked by anyone at all for a long time. In most FTP RTS games the Battle Protection timer continues even when you are Offline, but in KW\nBattle Protection pauses removing the Competitive aspect of this game by a lot. Luckily though, you can never be matched against an army bigger than your own. After some mishaps here and there and unbalanced features the gameplay is still solid and since it will most likely be improved in future updates it isn't such a big issue. I give the gameplay in this game a 6/10. Which will most likely become an 8/10 or a 9/10 if they fix these issues.\n\nThe biggest problem in this game so far are the graphics and the countless bugs that keep appearing, while this may sound like a stupid thing to say, in this case it really isn't. The resolution in this game is incredibly low, I have seen games from back in 2001 that look better than Kingdom Wars. And Kingdom Wars was made in 2010. The bugs though are far worse than the Graphics. People are constantly reporting in that they crash during Sieges or that they bought something with real money and didn't get what they bought an even bigger issue is that the resource counter doesn't work. For example, sometimes I make 10 food per minute and 95 wood per minute and then 10 minutes later I make 29.9 food per minute and 63.5 wood per minute, the Resource counter is by far the biggest issue. Small things like this can be quite irritating at times but it is also to be expected from a WIP game and will most likely be fixed eventually.\n\nCons include:\n\n-Outdated graphics\n-Several unbalanced gameplay elements\n-Lots of bugs\n-Huge amount of dialogue can be a bit overwhelming at times\n\nHowever this may sound negative, the pros in this case outnumber and outscale the cons by far. Pros like:\n\n-Solid gameplay\n-Lots of detailed lore\n-Frequent updates usually containing lots of bug fixes\n-An ever growing, non-toxic and friendly community\n-Great and active staff members\n-And most importantly, NOT pay2win\n\nThis game has a lot of potential. As long as the developers get rid of bugs and expands upon its pros, this game will have a bright future ahead of it.","November 8, 2014","true","24.9"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","1"

Single Player mode is broken up into three sub-sections; Lay Siege is a quick jump in and play random scenario that starts the player with a squadron of troops and siege weapons (such as Belfries and Trebuchets) in a basic camp just outside the enemy fortress .The goal is to invade the enemy fortress break open the main gate and kill the king. There is only one wave to play in lay Siege and the outcomes does not affect your save file Homelands.\n\n\nNext we have Castle Defense, a little more involved, where players instead are given a hometown with peasants,soldiers,and walls. Tower upgrades, many archers, and spike traps are key to surviving the long siege as wave upon wave of enemy troops march towards your castle front. One problem with this mode is that the enemy troops swarm up by their target gate but do not move out-of-the-way for the battering rams to do their job. Soldiers don’t break in, siege weapons stand around, in fact everyone stands around slowly getting picked off by a single battalion of archers perched within the final keep. Even when the next wave arrives the only rip apart what they can easily access. Again all spoils go to no one after victory/defeat is declared.\n\n\n\nLastly for single player there is the Kingdoms mode. This is like a campaign but more open ended. It uses the World Map but with less instruction than the Online Kingdom provides. And instead of quests and tutorials players are given an expected battle every few minutes regardless of progress made. The goal of this mode is to conquer the entire World Map without your Hometown being captured by the enemy forces. This is in my experience the hardest part of the game,and if you are new to the game and confused on how the world map works, don’t fret, it is explained in the Online Kingdom mode, the main mode of the game,which is next.\n\nThe Online Kingdom mode is a go-at-your own pace experience that guides players through a story based on the player’s selected Kingdom. This game differs from the single player games because it revolves around taking armies out from your hometown and bringing them to the World Map so that they can travel to other towns and quest locations. Other towns give means of trade, buying mercenaries, training units to do other jobs; and in a pinch acting as a place holder for precious units when the town population cap(s) are full. Swapping between the two perspectives, world map and town, is the vital key to Dawn of Fantasy’s uniqueness.\n\nAlong with all the mechanics introduced in the other modes, this one has an extra influence resource known as crowns that can be used to buy other resources,speed up building constructions, and most importantly buy special units such as dragons and Dwarven fighters. For $9.99 you can buy 120 crowns which grants one the option to purchasing the Royal Dragon, the most powerful unit in the game. Unlike the Kingdom’s Mode of single player, battles are engaged at the pace of the player. The image below is a swarm of Orc Riders actually waiting to speak with my towns hero before deciding to attack my precious colony.\n\n\n\nWith all these gameplay modes spending an hour or two building armies and raising an effective economy is quite easy. Units are created in squads of multiple members. Instead of training one peasant for 180 food the game actually trains 5 little guys on the screen, same goes for infantry. Despite these 5 little workers being spawned the towns’ population is only increased by 1 for doing this. Building houses also increases the total population cap by 1, making a booming economy a very long-term goal. Paradoxically, gathering times for resources in Dawn of Fantasy  are a slower than some may find comfortable. This is to encourage the World Map exploration and trade, as well as looting the dead corpses with peasants for that extra economic boost. Erecting buildings requires no peasants, but takes on average an hour to complete without the use of any crowns.\n\nPresentation of the game has a few minor bugs in it as well. Some background cameras in town menus do not stay on course and can be spastic. Leaving your mouse on a button can provide information, but it does not help when the information box is in front of another button. The ticker above head saying the resources gathered per minuet is also inaccurate, and will not update even when there are peasants collecting a resource .\n\nDespite these few hiccups the game itself is a treat to play. The camera controls are well done, same can be said about the speech banks. Unlike Age of Empires, the characters in-game actually say what needs your attention, instead of the sound cues you has to learn about through multiple session will not disappear Dawn of Fantasy is a game filled with hours of gameplay for the strategist waiting to capture castles and rule a world of fantasy. The PvP options now are for the competitive player mostly, because you cannot share resources with other player in-game, however alliances in a multiplayer game .","November 22, 2014","true","7.4"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Taking the scale of the total war series and stronghold games it is a game you are sure to play for hours. My inicial recations and thoughts on the game were that it would be a pay to win players dream, but this was not the case. Like many F2P games out there paying only gets you cosmetics that have no greater purpose. The ingame economy system is also well balanced with limatations to just how much you can acheive. Based around four main resource types and crowns, the harder to earn currency, you'll have a fun time trying to arrange your workers into such a way to balacnce it out. Another strong point in this game is the graphics and model textures. For being made by a realtively small company the game is very well looking with some much going on at once with minmal to no lag what-so-ever. Going off of graphics they have a very sound sound engine (pun intended) that has very realistic effects and ambience.\n\nNow no game is perfect, this game does have a few bugs now and then, but nothing gamebreaking. The devs and mods are on all the time with their fanbase and players supporting and helping when they can. It can also be a little on the hard to run side if your computer is a little on the lower side. With the amount and time the devs put in this game can only get better in the future.","November 2, 2014","true","84.7"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

First of all I have to say this ISN'T pay to win. I think people saying that didn't understood the game at all. Everything is achievable through gameplay for everyone, only payable items are pure estetics, also the premium just gives a speed boost in certain ways, it is for example like buying an exp boost on league of legends, you just go faster, not better. I repeat, this is a free game, so you can't blame people who use the premium, you can get the full gameplay without it. Guys spending money, are just helping the devs and the game getting better and bigger, is that a bad thing? That said, the game is great, I see a lot of potential. Yes, there are some bugs (what game has no bugs?) and the devs are awesome in fixing them as fast as possible. Just try the game and see yourself, it is free.\nI really hope new players will come, this game truly deserves it.","November 2, 2014","true","60.6"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

Back when they had the cash shop.  Although some poeple felt that it was pay to win, it was not in the least bit since I never spent a dime on it and still was able to pve and pvp without problems.  Still to this day now that it's F2P, you still don't have to pay for anything since your armies are always matched with people of similar armies.  It's a really good way of handeling a cash shop.  If you don't want to pay any money, you will have to learn how to play is all, which isn't a bad thing.\n\nIt was a buggy game when I first got a hold of it, as most newish games, and that did deter me for about 4 months.  After a while they had a few patches that made it less laggy for me and that's when I started racking up the hours, Building more cities, destroying more foes, and gathering those crowns for more armies.  I grew up playing RTS games, Age of Empires was my first multiplayer game, and I played that for a couple of years along with Empire earth when it came out.  This has strong elements of your typical RTS, but it has so much more.  Long term cities, taking over NPC towns, exploring the map, questing, and co-op sieging just to name a few great things that seperate it from your standard RTS.\n\nI had so much fun that I invited a few friends to play with me and after teaching them how to play we were pillaging empires left and right.  When you play with friends, it usually makes a game that much more fun.  You invite friends, your friends invite friends, etc..  Soon you can start an alliance with people you know that you will get along with.  Although you can only 2v1 vs AI, and 1v1 in pvp, hopefully later in the games life they can expand that.   Good times were spent on sieging cities with a friend.\n\nI wasn't too interested in the MMO part of this game at first, I had played world of warcraft for about 2 years back in 2008, and grew out of it, but this game fits right in and youre not overpowerd by MMO nerds sitting on a ♥♥♥♥ bucket and trying to hit on a night elf.   I grew up playing age of empires, empire earth, and starcraft.  Although this game isnt on the same level, it's still tons of fun.  More of a long term RTS.\n\nSince I bought the game, fast forward to today, Reverie has had many great patches that improved the game immensely, and with the launch of their FtP model, it's better than ever.  New units, new buildings, better performance, vassels, and unit balencing (and that's just the tip of the iceberg)\n\nAlso, I have a guide on my profile for new players to get some all arounds tips for the game.\n\n9/10  Unique, fun, cheap, and helpful devs/mods.  Would buy again.","November 13, 2014","true","138.3"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

One thing I would like to see is the game not to shuffle around there product, from moving an unite they already have in the game to another place in the game or changing there over all product they are selling (from an game you paid for to a game you always have to pay for). On the other hand am sure that they are trying there best and they did give us fair composition for the price we paid for I just don't like the switch. there game graphic are superb and content is plentiful, I you like the challenge of winning against an army that is similar in level and strength to you this is the game to play.

I was so excited about this game in my first day, that I draged 5 of my friends to play this game.  With any game you find what you like and don't like.  What sets this game off for me is, its what I expect an MMORTS to be!  When friends of mine ask me, whats the game like or how to compare it.  I tell them that this is a unique game, then I tell them I can help them learn.  I personly found the game easy to learn and so did my friends.  The game is complex to get you very excited, but not difficult by any means.  The game runs smooth on the graphics and is very appealing to the eyes.  Yet of course my favorite thing of all about this game however is the building of my own castle and how I want to build my army, hoping for more styles of castle and land layouts down the road!  So would I recommend this game to anyone, yes deffenitely!  Even if you don't care for  the multiplayer aspect or your not a true rts fan, give this game a whirl, I bet you'll find something you highly enjoy about Kingdom Wars.","November 3, 2014","true","43.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

To me the multiplayer is pretty straight foreward, and i wouldnt change a thing about it.\n\nDifficult- 9/10 Im going to admit, this game is VERY difficult. your troops die pretty easily and its not easy to get precious resorces like wood stone gold or food. by building a wide variety of building, it eats up all of them. this is where the money spenders come in and get a free run to succession\n\noverall i would STRONGLY recommed this game due to the fact that it is free and is AMAZING, and i would pay for this game any day. this game is a mix of banished,mount and blade, and stronghold crusader. if i were you i would get my hands on this before the developers put a price on this. i hope this helped you make you decision:)","November 3, 2014","true","89.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Kingdom Wars is like the Total War Series + the Age of Empires Series. What I love about this game is that there are 3 Factions that are playable, the Humans, the Orcs, and the Elves, each with its own unique strengths. There is also a conquerable map that has little settlements that have their very own, very detailed lore. This game is also not a frustrating Pay2win game, although, there is a special currency called influence that you may buy with real money, and the currency is needed to grow your Empire, it is not that hard to get though. There are many ways to get this special currency, one way is to log in everyday and debate whether to claim Influence or the Random item, another way to get Influence would be to battle with other players. The Community so far seems very nice and so far I've not met many people who want to make you have a bad time while playing. The game offers very fun challenges that really are challenging!

Some times the game just freezes... just like that, mostly it starts running again after a minute, but some times you have to close it via task manager and when you restart it then, your progress of over half a hour of gameplay is lost... and that happened to me two times.\n3rd : This one is a even bigger one and seriously ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off. The trebuchets are broken.\nI was doing the quest "Dangerous Neighbours" and attacked the second of the three strongholds.\nIt had 2 stonewalls, towers, mounted trebuchets a.s.o. I had a full army of swordsmen, maceman, and archers, with 10 trebuchets and 1000 stones. I ordered my trebuchets to throw the stones on one wall segment of the outer wall and set them on "hold fire" so they kept shooting and shooting. I know that catapults are no accurate weapon, but with the trebuchets in this game you can be happy if they hit anything. After several minutes some buildings were damaged, but those were mostly buildings inside the walls and a few soldiers were killed, but nothing happened to the wall segment which i told my trebuchets to attack.\nMany frustrating minutes later there were no stones left to throw at the enemy. In the end my trebuchets destroyed two towers and dozens of houses, but the targetet wall segment still had about 50% of its HPs left so i had to cancel the attack, because there was no way i could get into the Stronghold anymore.\n\nBUT I still recommend this game because those things can be fixed by patches and because this game is free to play.","February 13, 2015","true","19.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Including the beta period and prior to steam release.

Its one of those games were you throw it on for abit, do some stuff then switch it off to come back tomorrow to           more troops, resources, etc. Constant quests will be given so you'll be busy unless you have to siege, which later on you will be doing a lot.  Battles can scale from a small skrimish to full on siege with a wide selection of troops, monsters, war machines, heros, dragons , etc.  Though choosing your battles is the most important because you can be quickly overwhelmed and overrunned.\n\n- Is this bad?\n- In some areas, yes. Combat is very clunky and fights are one big bloody orgy at most.(Blood for the Blood god!!) That and most units if left unchecked will run around chasing god knows what and probably die. Mostly peasants which you'll be lossing left and right when exploring or fighting. No real tatics in open battles or quests. Just send your army in one direction and loot the dead  as they go.(This isn't Total War guys). It comes down to who has more numbers though the more veterans you have the better for you or it can worst because a high level unit of knights can 3 v 1 and win. Seiges you have to plan or you will loss your army fast and retreating is, at times more costly. So once you start theres no going back. Units only rout during quest's so don't expect units to ♥♥♥♥ themselves when 3 dragons burn down a whole castle.\n\n- Factions?\n- Puny 'umans\n- Dem pointy ear'd elve boyz.\n- And da best of all, da Orkz! WAAAAAAAAAAGH!\n\n- Is this game pay to win like most MMO's?\n- No. Its there but IT CAN be avoided completely. Daily rewards can help in some areas depending on what you get. Plus quests often give you tons of loot, crowns, food, troops, etc. The store is there but name one MMO out there that doesn't have a store. Plus if you do want to sink some money into this game it's really cheap. The most expensive thing is about $30 bucks.  Which isn't bad for what you get out of it.\n\n- Should I try this?\n- If you like Fantesy games and city management games, try this. And for ♥♥♥♥ sake this game is free so you're not spending a cent on it. If you liked Stronghold(The orginal, not the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ones) and would like more city management then this a game for you.\n\n","November 5, 2014","true","24.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Noxxiee/recommended/227180/","Noxxiee","(Including Gnar adc)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Noxxiee/","89 products in account","I've been looking for a game that melds a lot of features from some of my favourite strategy games into an online environment, a game that is set aside from others within the same genre, and this really is it. The game is not pay to win and is paced really well, it's not slow nor is it fast, you really feel rewarded from what you receive through the steady rate of progression. The quests help to push you in the right direction while you're starting out, and after just a few hours you'll be making some really steady progress toward the more end-game options.\n\nPositives: As mentioned previously, the game is not pay to win, finding a game like this that is both enjoyable, f2p, and not pay to win seems to be the gaming equivalent of finding gold in your back garden, for this I am very grateful. You have several different options in terms of how you would like to play the game, do you want to be economically focused, do you want to focus on military, etc; this kind of choice makes the game strategically diverse and allows you to shape how you want to play the game, and I felt that this made the game far more enjoyable, especially if you play with friends and work together by taking up different roles.\n\nNegatives: The game is a little buggy right now, and performance can vary. While trying to use the windowed mode feature I found my game crashing very frequently, and I ultimately had to disable that option. I also got stuck in one of the tutorials while trying to access the menu. So the game is definitely in need of some polish. Combat could also do with some work; the current system gets the job done but is quite clunky and very messy. You send your units in and then sit back and hope for the best. Of course the graphics are quite basic but they are bearable, a slight overhaul would be a nice quality of life improvement. A little more direction for players completely new to the genre would also be very useful.\n\nOverall, from my gameplay experience and from the masses of reading I've done about the game, I think it's great and absolutely worth a try. The developers are keen on improving the game and are asking for feedback whenever possible, which really tells me they have their head in the right place.","December 14, 2014","true","22.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Its tough at first starting out (for humans that is, I am not a fan of Orc or Elven playstyle) but once you get a decent setup the game becomes fairly easy if you can invest time into your economy first before rushing off to pvp and siege.\n\nPvp however is fairly unbalanced as all the high levels who use their near unkillable lvl 60 hero's and dragons to terrorize lesser players. Though my sound advice for dealing with small minotaur forces and Hero's is massed Crossbows for the humans. Works like a charm.\n\nWhile there is an ingame micro transaction thing its completely option for customizables, and several booster packs that can only be bought once per city slot, I think this is a fair system compared to other games like battle pirates where its forcing you to constantly spend to stay up to date.\n\nThe factions play very differently from one another, Humans play like most fuedal and medieval armies with a large portion of their troops (or as my suggestion goes for) A lot of Halbardier and Archer battalions as they are the cheapest to upgrade at the local training yard, Human siege is rather inaccurate and I would suggest for those dedicated siege armies to bring along 5-10 Treb's or 8 Dwarvern cannons if you have the crowns for them.\n\nI overall give the game a 6.5/10 for soild gameplay, friendly community, nice enough looking graphics.\n\nThough there are quite a few bugs overall besides the occassional resource loss or other minor incident I would recomend this game to my friends.","March 21","true","180.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","2","3","2","0"

OR around 100 euros.\n\nnow i do not have much of a problem grinding in this game since it's really great once you have the hang of it. another, small footnote is that it may take you a few tries before you have a city/army that doesn't lose all the time. resource gathering is also slightly slugish (expect a cap of around 30.000 units total with no research on a daily basis).","December 31, 2015","true","170.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Lots of options for varied town and playing styles.\n\nMy only critique is that for mission completion there is no help guide.  Certain functions are no explained, so just use the chat to ask another player, so far the community has been pretty helpful.","August 10, 2015","true","44.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

People who are fans of city-building simulators will also find much to enjoy in this unique title.\n\nWhile Kingdom Wars has gone through many changes, some good, some less-than-desirable, overall the experience is really something that has to be experienced to understand it.  The very early stages of the game can be somewhat confusing, however it is my understanding that the developers have addressed this issue in the time since I was a new player.\n\nAlthough there is the option to spend real money (in fact, I obtained my copy of the game back when it was still a regular purchasable title) the game truly is "free to play" in the sense that, while you can beef up your army using real money purchases, you will not be penalized for not doing so.  When PvP occurs (which is largely optional) players are matched up roughly based on the strength of their armies.  This is not an absolutely perfect system, however it vastly eliminates the possiblity that your opponent will have an absurly stronger army than yours via real money purchases.\n\nAlso, both the PvP and the PvE aspects of the game are truly exciting and offer an experience not found in other RTS games or titles from other genres.  While similar to PvP, the PvE side of the game can be better tailored for those who like a more relaxed approach to playing.\n\nThe thing I like most in the game is the building of one's kingdom, which is a gradual process that can take weeks or months to expand, depending on your playstyle.  It is really fun to carefully plan your defenses out and try to set up ambushes for would-be attackers, while at the same time it can be very engaging in that you take semi-permanent losses from battles, so you are encouraged to really think things through.  This is the most true for the human race (who specializes in defense) however all of the races, humans, elves and orcs, have an aspect of this.\n\nThe different races play quite differently and I actually have yet to branch out into the orcs and elves, but their playstyles are all unique and offer a vast amount of play time should you choose to explore all three.  Even with only having focused on one race, I have spent many hours on this game and feel like I have only scratched the surface.\n\nThis game has its rough edges, but the developers are serious about making it as polished as can be and have been working hard to make many changes that both improve the gameplay and well as the look and feel of the game.  Bugs have been being addressed over time and overall the game can be played and enjoyed with few interruptions caused by bugs.  The UI (User Interface) could use some attention, however it is still quite functional and usable after some experience with it.\n\nOverall, this game is really fun (which is the most imporant part to many people) and worthy of sinking at least a couple dozen hours into it before deciding if you like it or not.  Do not be fooled by the graphics or the first few minutes of the game - this game is huge and in a very good way.","August 5, 2015","true","138.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

OR around 100 euros.\n\nnow i do not have much of a problem grinding in this game since it's really great once you have the hang of it. another, small footnote is that it may take you a few tries before you have a city/army that doesn't lose all the time. resource gathering is also slightly slugish (expect a cap of around 30.000 units total with no research on a daily basis).","December 31, 2015","true","170.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Works like a charm.\n\nWhile there is an ingame micro transaction thing its completely option for customizables, and several booster packs that can only be bought once per city slot, I think this is a fair system compared to other games like battle pirates where its forcing you to constantly spend to stay up to date.\n\nThe factions play very differently from one another, Humans play like most fuedal and medieval armies with a large portion of their troops (or as my suggestion goes for) A lot of Halbardier and Archer battalions as they are the cheapest to upgrade at the local training yard, Human siege is rather inaccurate and I would suggest for those dedicated siege armies to bring along 5-10 Treb's or 8 Dwarvern cannons if you have the crowns for them.\n\nI overall give the game a 6.5/10 for soild gameplay, friendly community, nice enough looking graphics.\n\nThough there are quite a few bugs overall besides the occassional resource loss or other minor incident I would recomend this game to my friends.","March 21","true","180.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","2","3","2","0"

Kingdom Wars has much more to do and livens up the game play and that is a nice chance of what you get used to playing these types.   Lots of options for varied town and playing styles.\n\nMy only critique is that for mission completion there is no help guide.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zipcouda/recommended/227180/","zipcouda","Zipcouda","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zipcouda/","288 products in account","Interesting game... I will explain.\n\nFirst off I highly recommend you do the tutorial and actually take the time to read the texts. There is never to much written but there is no voice acting. But the tutorial gives you a lot of needed knowledge to get the hang of the game. Also you might want to start as humans first, the other races, elfs and orcs. have confusing build structures.\n\nNow when it comes to explaining this game I would have to say, it is stronghold kingdoms map combined with a sort of Total war style combat / with age of empires sort of peasantry. Read bellow this for a further explanation.\n\nStronghold Kingdoms - When in the main world map you will see separate borders. Your settlement will be one of several in a sort of county, with several other faction areas in a province type area. A border separates these which makes it easy to know whose who.\n\nTotal War - When it comes to units in this game, you do have large formations of units instead of single soldier running about. When you construct a unit 20 come out inside of one. So when you enter war or move your units to investigate a camp, you will have the different archers in their group, soldiers, knights, so on.\n\nAge of Empires - When it comes to building structures in this game it feels like Age of Empires. Granted you wont find yourself having the peasants build the buildings, but instead you select an available spot on the ground to construct a building. Now the peasants are used to gather materials around the town area, Gold, Wood, Stone, and food are all the average resources you need to have them gathering.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThings to know when you start!\n\n- You have a 24 hr peace period, meaning other players cannot attack you until after 24 hours.\n\n- Your selection of traits and plains where you build will decide a lot of stuff. Such as if wood is plentiful (plains area) , if stone is easily accessible (In mountains) , Also lastly is wooded areas (In Forests).\n\n- Doing the quests at the beginning will advance your story line, get you free resources, and decent experience towards the game as well. They are easy and actually very fun to complete.\n\n- This is a Stronghold Kingdoms style rts. Which means buildings will start building slower and slower the more you construct. If you don't want to put much time in a breathing game you may want to steer clear.\n\n- I have done little castle work, besides in the tutorial. My reflection on it though is like a Total War style castle. You build the wall then garrison the unit squads along the walls. You also build single siege weapons to attack the walls, making it easier to maneuver or attack different sections of the walls.\n\n- I did not access the market as of yet, though I clicked on it once to view it. It did seem a bit pay to win, as you purchase crowns like on stronghold kingdoms. Then you use the crowns to get resources , fast building , though it does not seem to allow unit purchase. You can purchase dragons though... not sure how OP they are.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMy Impressions\n\n- Early stages of the game I am enjoying. It feels like Age of Empires as my units charge around to wreck the wicked soldiers and goblins about. Making gold and other resources depends completely on how many peasants you send to that specific resource.\n\n- The late game makes me nervous, I really cannot tell if the game has the system like Stronghold Kingdoms that sort of punishes higher lvl players for attacking lower , newer players. But I guess that will be something we see in a few days if I just get rolled by some troll.\n\n- So far I do like this game, its worth continuing to play and I hope to see the population on the game grow.","November 6, 2014","true","3.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Also that having other races like man, orc, and elves is great because it reminds me that the game is almost like Lord of Rings.

It had conquest in a way that other strategy games could only hope for, but the games that could achieve that level were no where near as Kingdom Wars. This game was well thought out and the graphics are perfect for this kind of game(due to huge ♥♥♥ armies and monsters filling your screen) runs pretty damn well on a laptop. all in all, im hooked, im in love, and i got to stick a sword in another lord's face.

Also, the game makes sure to help the player as much as it can by having an option to contact directly to the creator, and giving a well-planned tutorial line of quests and a 24 hour protection (that counts ONLY when you're online) which I personally love.\nThird, It's just fun! You can customize the looks of your town, build a powerful army and siege all of your opponents' citis, striking fear into their eyes! Also, the NPCs are very entertaining and the game in general gives you a great expirience while playing.\n\nMy final point: The game is great, and it's free so if you have the time and will you should DEFINATLY give it a shot. You won't regreat it. (and if you will, don't worry.

And i have to say i was suprised of how fun and addicting the game was.  The beginning was a little slow but whe you are starting to get quests and your building massive armies it's awesome. For example i had an army of 60/60 all swordsmen, archers, catapults, and battering rams. I was super confident with this army lest to say because they had seen some fights all of the swordsmen were like lvl 10. But i got a little to confident and tried to seige a orc city and man i had no chance. I like the fact that i cant just jump in and seige the hardest city and expect to win. Right now im doing my best to improve my population and expand my power. It is definently a game with plenty of replay value because you can play as three different factions the Humans, Orcs, and Elfs. Right now having a blast with this game look foward to playing everday and completing more quests and becoming the strongest.

Also, the game makes sure to help the player as much as it can by having an option to contact directly to the creator, and giving a well-planned tutorial line of quests and a 24 hour protection (that counts ONLY when you're online) which I personally love.\nThird, It's just fun! You can customize the looks of your town, build a powerful army and siege all of your opponents' citis, striking fear into their eyes! Also, the NPCs are very entertaining and the game in general gives you a great expirience while playing.\n\nMy final point: The game is great, and it's free so if you have the time and will you should DEFINATLY give it a shot. You won't regreat it. (and if you will, don't worry. The community is very helpful and the developers are open for suggestions at any time, so you can help them to make the game better! :D)","November 3, 2014","true","34.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

And i have to say i was suprised of how fun and addicting the game was.  The beginning was a little slow but whe you are starting to get quests and your building massive armies it's awesome. For example i had an army of 60/60 all swordsmen, archers, catapults, and battering rams. I was super confident with this army lest to say because they had seen some fights all of the swordsmen were like lvl 10. But i got a little to confident and tried to seige a orc city and man i had no chance. I like the fact that i cant just jump in and seige the hardest city and expect to win. Right now im doing my best to improve my population and expand my power. It is definently a game with plenty of replay value because you can play as three different factions the Humans, Orcs, and Elfs. Right now having a blast with this game look foward to playing everday and completing more quests and becoming the strongest. Totally recommend this game for all strategy game fans!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","November 2, 2014","true","22.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sylkana/recommended/227180/","sylkana","Ngaur","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sylkana/","51 products in account","I've very much enjoyed this game.  I chose to go Elves, and much like another review I read some time ago they have a very Protoss-esque feel to them.  Their units are individually stronger than all the others, however they train slower and cost more.  Their buildings also give great benefits, yet generally seem to be on the fairly costly side.\n\nYet the cost usually isn't an issue as their economy is entirely trickle based, well actually it's mostly trickle based, the single glaring and strange exception to this is stone.  The lack of any way other than through alchemy or manual mining to get stone is honestly a pretty big issue, especially since I've been getting a resource boost already and was only making about 4 stone per minute if I didn't use alchemy - contrast that to the ten food per minute and the 25+ wood per minute.\n\nThe balance of resource gathering, at least for Elves, is off.  You have a resource cap, however most of your resources are going to be wood considering it takes zero effort to get lumber as an Elf.  As a matter of fact you start off the game getting 10+ wood per minute, compared to the paltry sums of about 1 to 3 per minute of everything else.\n\nDespite that issue the game was absolutely still worth trying and playing and, for those looking for a slower-paced gameplay or an RTS that didn't take up all your time, the Elves would have been right up your alley.\n\nThe main benefit of the Elves, I feel, is the ability to log off of the game and come back some hours later to build your buildings and military up.  As resources continue to trickle in whether or not you're logged on it feels like a game that doesn't force you to pay attention to it every waking second of every day in order to progress, which, honestly, was a breath of fresh air.\n\nFurthermore it's really nice not to have to worry about being attacked while logged off, unlike some games.  While it's a little clunky and has a few issues every once in a while the dev team is very active and clearly working hard to bring the best experience they can.  In such I really do suggest trying this game out if you're in the market for a fantasy RTSMMO.","November 8, 2014","true","15.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Something I've been looking for, for a long time. It's quick, fast paced, and full of action. Lacking in a few departments though, as outlined below (for now.. maybe they'll update.)\n\nRemember Warcraft? Starcraft? The strategy it took? yet how short the games were?  Well this is a persistant version which will span the eons~!  This game, putting strategy to 11, and action to 12. Kingdom wars is my personal new addiction.. My girlfriend says I should stop playing it, after putting in over 60 hours in less than 5 days! The up-to-date graphics and the strategy. It's all wonderful..\n\n\n\n\nHere is some things they could add to make the game much better:\n\nAdd a "Formation setup" option for pre-battle, so the troops are already set up the way you want instead of some weird star, or all mashed together.. it makes it difficult to grab the troops you want.  Or just a "formation setup" in the choices on the world map for the armies. like where it says "Transfer" "Camp" "split army" etc..\n\nHave seperate tabs for troop types when they exceed the maximum "select all", or preset saved tabs for number keys, instead of having to reset them every battle. for an example.. (i don't know the max 'select all' option)  Say the max was 10 for example.. and you have 15 of said troop in your army. when you click the tab for knights, 5 would be not selected. Have a seperate tab for those extras.\n\nAuto trade routes.  for instance, setup where you can set an army on the world map to go to a certain town, trade, for gold, and return home automatically.\n\nPre-battle map spawn choices. When you join someone in a coop battle, both players troops are all mashed together, and we spend 5-10 minutes just seperating them and setting them up. Or if we wanted to flank in opposite directions. the choice and versitility would be a nice addition.. or atleast setting us up seperately instead of all mashed together.\n\nAbility to choose which army is picked for coop battles... countless times I've been asked to coop, but it gave me one of my side armies, and not my main one.\n\nAn army moral bonus (small bonus of some kind like +3% bonus to all stats or some crap) while within a certain range of your main hero, if it's on the field.\n\nAbility to choose organise pesants in your home town... I don't know how many times I went "hmmm... how many do i have chopping wood, gold digging, getting food, etc etc.. how many are doing what?" lol. A list would be nice..\n\nAbility to organise troops by your choice, not forced choice. I personally like to organise my troops by level, but it's impossible to do your current way.\n\nRandomize the maps.. not areas, just where enemies spawn.\n\nAbility to move / rezise the chat box... it's in the way, or if it's not in the way, we can't see it.\n\nEDIT: Auto battle / map clear ability. Say you are training multiple units, you send them off to a region, and usually keep combing over the same area over and over.. set a choice to let the units clear on their own.\n\nStretch the world map a few thousand units, and allow players to see other players towns.. this would open up player sieging by choice, not random chance.\n\nArchers target walls / doors / buildings sometimes, which can be a pain when you want them to attack the enemy archers on the walls / bridges to protect your rams.\n\nAside from these, I'm a huge fan of the game so far.. cheers.

I've played plenty of Warcraft in my lifetime, but this, even with its low graphics and complicated play style, has been very fun. The co-op missions were also a great way for me and my friend to set goals in the game, since it gets harder with a friend than by yourself. With the races, humans have to be the most balanced between resource gathering and troop building, elves are easier to being able to build but harder to gather food to build an army, and orcs are the zerg of the three races with troop-making being a lot easier.

At the time, I wasn't particularly impressed, as it lacked a lot of the freedom of your typical city-builder, and the progress seemed slow enough that I wondered if I'd ever see my town grow into a city before losing interest in the game.\n\nIn retrospect, I think I had largely missed the point.\n\nAs it has gone free-to-play, firstly, I'm glad it avoided the pittfalls of becoming a pay-to-win game in the process, as the two more often than not go hand-in-hand. My town is still small and undeveloped, and as more of a city-builder myself, I have yet to really go deep into the siege/warfare aspects of the game. The controls for that, in what little of it I have engaged in, were a little clunky and troops were difficult to manage, but it seemed that it was surmountable, and that with time and experience, one could probably master the warfare system, should they be inclined to do so.\n\nAs a city-builder, which is where I'm coming from, it is a bit limited, as you don't really choose where buildings go as freely as you do in most others. That said. it has been fun seeing my town grow, and stocking it with a large enough garrison to defend myself against any potential attackers. In fact, the game is probably more comparable to an online game I used to play called Travian, but it is very polished graphically in comparison, and much deeper in terms of variability and different units/buildings.\n\nThe slow pace of the game might deter some, but I've come to enjoy stopping by every so often to see how many resources my villagers have accumulated. I check in once every other night or so, and in that span they've usually cobbled together enough stuff for me to be able to signifiantly add to my town with each log in.\n\nAll-in-all, it's not a game for everyone, and it limits the freedom of both the city-builder and the strategy/siege models, however in return it provides both of those in one game, doing something unique and playable, to me anyway. There's a lot in here for one game, and not necessarily too much, as is so often the case these days.\n\nThe price is right, these days, so it's certainly worth giving a shot, and remember to log in a few times before giving up on it, if you're not enjoying it so much. It wasn't until my fifth login or so that I started realizing that I was actually having fun with the game. Be that a critique or not, I recommend the game as it currently stands.","November 7, 2014","true","29.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gloria/recommended/227180/","Gloria","Chumba","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gloria/","89 products in account","Not a free to play - This is not a free to play game, and it is easy to see that it is not. Most games that are MMO city builders like this rely heavily on users buying boosters. This games does not. First of all, there are only three boosters in the game, and you can not use more than 1 of them per in-game account/city. The boosters that are there give you resources that are helpful to a beginner, but if you build your city up a bit, they can easily be aquired.\n\nPvP - When I first started, I was afraid of going into the PvP part of the game. I was afraid that people who have already made giant cities and huge armies could walk in and take all of my things; this is definitely not the case. They have balanced the game enough so that you can only fight people within 10% of your army strength. 10% is so little, that it makes you rely only on good tactics. It makes EVERY siege/co-op/defence really fun and actually a really good match. Also, most of the online playing is co-op, which is honestly one of the most fun parts of the game. You can raid AI cities or do quests with your friends, and it makes the gameplay really fun, without getting completely screwed over. Also, if you REALLY do not like PvP, you can buy the single player campaign for only $1.99, which is honestly a good deal for how fun this game is.\n\nBuilding your city - It is hard to build your city at the start, since resources are scarce. This is the point where the co-op takes place and is a big help. You can do quests with your friends and fight armies, and take all of the resources off of their cold dead bodies. This part beats every other city builder into dust. You can actually command your armies, instead of it being auto resolved for you. The game features 3 different races: humans, elves, and orcs. Each race is very balanced, and it would be a very hard decision on if you were to ask which race was the best. This lets you face other online players (or play WITH them) without worrying that their units are SOO much better than yours.\n\nRaiding cities - Later on, once you have a big and tough army, you can start raiding AI cities. There are 30 (from my knowledge) cities that you can siege and either loot or make your vassel. Looting can be helpful, and gives you a lot of resources; while vassels give you resources over time.\n\nDo not be turned away because it is an online city builder. Most of this game is co-op, instead of facing other players. You can join a clan and help each other out by sending each other resources. My in-game name is Enki, for anyone who has any more questions or wants to raid some AI with me! :)","November 2, 2014","true","106.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The game mechanics are very user-friendly and easy to become accostumed to.  I have read many comments regarding the graphics.  Being an older gamer (over 40) I found myself getting a little nostalgic, which I really liked.  The game is excellent.  The concept is great.  The experience is one of the best I have had.  The most appealing aspect of this game, in my opinion, is that it is Free-To-Play.  Keep in mind that it is a RTS game and it will take time to do all the great stuff there is to do in this game.

I personally view it as a Stronghold Crusaders + a dash of Total War + World of Warcraft (the RTS, not the MMO) + A strong influence of the game elements/mechanics of those web browser based games where you build a base and army and attack other people, get attacked etc. etc. I'm sure someone will correct me on the abreviation for that kind of game but I cant remember right now.\n\nNow here are some  VERY IMPORTANT  distinctions from the rest of those games that I and many people have been asking and looking for but have never found with other games similar to this one.\n\nThe developers built into the game features that actually prevent a P2W environment!\nFor example there is absolutely no 'Low Energy! Come back tomorrow... OR pay us $5-$10-$20-$50(best BS deal!) to keep playing!' because  there is no energy.\nYou cannot be attacked or attack players of higher or lower level (premium units? stronger opponents!) and  you cannot be attacked while offline!   Finally, thank you!\nWaiting for resources to gather and/or something to finish building and feel like there's nothing more to do in town? Make an army and go fight NPC/AI on the world map for gold and then use your spoils of war to buy those resources or even new units! Oh did i mention this is a great way to level up your units at the same time?\nOr just log off and go live your life and come back to find the resources collected while you were offline!\nYes there is 'premium' currency  but  it is  reasonably and realisticly  obtainable in-game for your time + effort for free! Quest's and NPC/AI battle's being the best way I've found persoanlly.\nAn actually entertaining story line.\nA suprisingly indepth and well made system for selecting your race, skills, and city location(s).\nSingle player  modes including campaign, seige, and seige defence.  You do have to pay $2 to unlock each of these modes however.  Personally this is not an issue for me as I don't plan on using single player mode, however it could be very useful to try out different seige strategies and really $2-$6 for this game is a ridiculously good deal considering some of the alpha games on here that cost $15 in the  hope  that they turn out good.\nPredetermined building locations make your city(s) astheticly pleasing, strategically challenging and easy to build! None of that layers and layers of wall's shinanigans like every one of those crappy web-based Base Building RTSMMO's\nWow those first five elements are  exactly what people have been asking for in games similar to this for years.  That is a  huge  reason I like this game. Now I can feel satisfied that I finally found a good game out there where the developers/owner(s)/publisher actually give a **** about what me, the player, wants in a game rather than how much money is on the paycheck. From the bottom of my heart,  thank you  and I hope you cotinue building the game like this while keeping the same ideals!\n\nYou know what's even better? If you actually do spend money on the game, lets say you buy a dragon for your army,  they protect your investment.  While your normal units disappear forever when they die, your premium units, like the dragon you bought, only get knocked out and lose a few levels. Oh and you can't make an army of just dragons because that would be P2W plus they can still be countered and defeated by a prepared player, there's a dragon slayer i got for  free  after all. Right off the bat they are giving me a unit that counters one of the stronger units in the game! To make it even more balanced there's a unit cap, each unit takes up a certain amount of space, so you have to choose what you bring to battle wisely, a small but individually strong group of heavy hitters? Perhaps a massive amount of inexpensive foot soldiers with archers? It's all about the strategy, not who had the larger wallet.\n\nAlso you wanna know something awesome the premium days you can buy in this game? You choose which days you want to use them for. How many games can you think of that actually do that for their players? Personally i don't know a single one, because money. Now for the other side of the coin, this game has flaws as all games natuarlly do.\n\nAnimations are decent, but not great. Yes things still take time to build but it's not ridiculous amounts (i.e. 5-7 days). You have to pay for extra cities (gotta make money somehow so this is perfectly reasonable and fine with me). The controls can't be customized and are a bit clunky, biggest issue for me personally is the right mouse button. It controls your units  but  it also moves the camera if you have a single unit selected, very annoying esspecially when your trying to moe just your hero. plus there's is a very noticeable delay between the click and the effect (at least for me on my laptop). Then sometimes nothing happens at all. Trying to organize and manage your units is awkward and needs to be streamed lined. Especially when you have to do it quickly (Very Frustrating). Not to mention you have to indiviually select units to activate their abilites/magic/skills/powers which is very hard when they are in combat.\n\nTheres also some minor graphical errors, especially when the weather changes and in a couple of cut scene's where the character(s) slowly turns invisible and OHMYGODTHEIREYESANDMOUTH! Personally I find that last type of glitch hilarious as it's actually pretty common in a lot of games. Upgrades and improvements of any and all kind require 'premium' currency, walls for example require an especially large ammount and you have 4 different one's to build, but like i said about premium currency, it is obtainable in-game for a reasonable amout of time and effort so a somewhat moot point.\n\nStill I love this game and plan on continuing to play it for quite some time at a casual level, kill some time here and there, build this and that, do a quest here and there. This is a game that easily works with how you play games, hard-core, casual, it dosen't matter because it caters to any type of play style. I have only been playing for 9.3 hrs at the time of this writing but i can already feel that within 30-45 days, I will have an impressive city and army to boot and will be knocking down a few peoples walls!\n\nI absolutely, highly recommend this game for people looking for a RTSMMO with RPG elements that lets you play at your own pace, your own schedule, your own style, your own budget and actually rewards you if you dont want to play all-day-everyday and throw money at it. Even if you do throw money at it it still goes  far beyond  what any other game I have played or known will do for you for your investment.\n\nSee you on the battle field and if you attack me, you shall feel the power and dismay of my elven arrows and Magical superiority!\n\nThis review helpful in anyway? Let me know below by leaving a comment and/or give a thumbs up and/or down.","November 7, 2014","true","15.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

It takes you into a wonderfully colorfull and well groomed fantasy land that is gorgouse to look at the more you adventure. Aside from Peasents and their endless offers of potato's you'll find a colorfull collection of unit types and specials that all races can use.\n\nThats right. you can be a human race, and have elven archers with orc brutes as your spearhead force. Whats more cool then that?\n\nOh right DRAGONS!!! You Can Have Dragons at your beck and call!!\n\nKingdom Wars brings to life THE entire fantasy adventure, dwarfs, elves, giant treeents, rampaging warg packs, ogres minotaurs and more await you in this well packed game. And its all Free to play. Additionally you can enjoy the entire game without having to spend money into it. Not that the fancy customization options wont tempt you.\n\nAs this is still a growing game, there are to be expected issues here and there, but with a lively staff, and friendly active in-game moderators anything that does happen can be worked out and solved so you can return to rasing your kingdom and adventuring across the world.","November 2, 2014","true","68.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

While there are always the Cape-Crusaders who will nitpick at every F2P and say how P2W it is, even though they aren’t, KWs is a Play to Win as opposed to Pay to Win. While there are of course boosts and the ‘premium’ currency, all of this is earned in game and is rather pay for convenience.\n\nAnd one of the best things I have seen on here is the fantastic moderator team they have in game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gloria/recommended/227180/","Gloria","Chumba","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gloria/","89 products in account","Not a free to play - This is not a free to play game, and it is easy to see that it is not. Most games that are MMO city builders like this rely heavily on users buying boosters. This games does not. First of all, there are only three boosters in the game, and you can not use more than 1 of them per in-game account/city. The boosters that are there give you resources that are helpful to a beginner, but if you build your city up a bit, they can easily be aquired.\n\nPvP - When I first started, I was afraid of going into the PvP part of the game. I was afraid that people who have already made giant cities and huge armies could walk in and take all of my things; this is definitely not the case. They have balanced the game enough so that you can only fight people within 10% of your army strength. 10% is so little, that it makes you rely only on good tactics. It makes EVERY siege/co-op/defence really fun and actually a really good match. Also, most of the online playing is co-op, which is honestly one of the most fun parts of the game. You can raid AI cities or do quests with your friends, and it makes the gameplay really fun, without getting completely screwed over. Also, if you REALLY do not like PvP, you can buy the single player campaign for only $1.99, which is honestly a good deal for how fun this game is.\n\nBuilding your city - It is hard to build your city at the start, since resources are scarce. This is the point where the co-op takes place and is a big help. You can do quests with your friends and fight armies, and take all of the resources off of their cold dead bodies. This part beats every other city builder into dust. You can actually command your armies, instead of it being auto resolved for you. The game features 3 different races: humans, elves, and orcs. Each race is very balanced, and it would be a very hard decision on if you were to ask which race was the best. This lets you face other online players (or play WITH them) without worrying that their units are SOO much better than yours.\n\nRaiding cities - Later on, once you have a big and tough army, you can start raiding AI cities. There are 30 (from my knowledge) cities that you can siege and either loot or make your vassel. Looting can be helpful, and gives you a lot of resources; while vassels give you resources over time.\n\nDo not be turned away because it is an online city builder. Most of this game is co-op, instead of facing other players. You can join a clan and help each other out by sending each other resources. My in-game name is Enki, for anyone who has any more questions or wants to raid some AI with me! :)","November 2, 2014","true","106.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The game mechanics are very user-friendly and easy to become accostumed to.  I have read many comments regarding the graphics.  Being an older gamer (over 40) I found myself getting a little nostalgic, which I really liked.  The game is excellent.  The concept is great.  The experience is one of the best I have had.  The most appealing aspect of this game, in my opinion, is that it is Free-To-Play.  Keep in mind that it is a RTS game and it will take time to do all the great stuff there is to do in this game.

Does not seem to have many pay to win aspects to it which is very good for a free to play game. Can get a $10 and $20 pack which will put you ahead but does not seem to give you anything you cant get already, devs need to eat too. Has a sort of Age of Empires feel to it which i like.\n\nUnit pathing currently seems to be a bit derpy but definitely not a game killer as im sure it will be fixed. Some other bigs here and there but no game breakers and im sure theyll be hammered out soon so that wont rly affect my judgement much.\n\nBe warned if youre at 90 pop cap in your city do not try to keep buying houses to increase your population, price will increase and youll keep paying wood but no new houses, they should definitely disable the button once you hit the cap, again nothing really major just something that made me a bit sad when i realized what happened.\n\nGame has a bit of a learning curve (like any mmo / rts). Could likely use some pop up hints perhaps to help new players along. Few of my friends i brought along to play were getting frustrated and i had to help em along, Which isnt a big deal i could just see players not having someone to help them simply giving up out of frustration. Yes i know there are tutorials in the game but lets be honest. Aint nobody got time for dat.\n\nOther than those few things which werent really al lthat bad i cant really think of anything negative so now ill start on the positive!\n\nSiege warfare seems so far to be implemented pretty well, I like the different world view and city views. You definitely have an mmo feel to it with the quests and your hero but also functions as a very good RTS, They have balanced it pretty well which makes this game pretty unique.\n\nI like the trading you can do in the game as well, different cities seem to have different prices for goods which also seems to fluctuate. Gives you something else to do other than the regular quest / kill grind.\n\nEarly game they have you start off pretty well. You have an income boost which helps a whole lot and really gives you a good nudge to get growing quick, I like the fact that they did this as it makes it so there is little down time / sitting around waiting for resources to accumilate.\n\nDifferent races seem to have different ways of collecting resources, for example orcs dont have farms like humans and they must hunt. Not too sure on elves as i have not played them but differences like this really make each race feel different and adds new things for you to do and new ways for you to play which can keep this game feeling fresh and new for a long time.\n\nNormally when i see a currency in a free to play game (crown in this game) I immediately have a bad feeling about the pay to win aspects. They seem to have made it so that after every battle or quest you get crowns, and you dont really need too many to progress. and the packs you are able to buy are limited to one per city slotso someone cant spend all this money and get 10 million crowns. Kudos to the devs on that one.\n\nWell thats pretty much all i could think of off the top of my head. Overall i would rate this game at a 7-9/10 (7-9 only because i feel like i would need to play to the end game in order to really be sure)","November 5, 2014","true","74.4"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","1"

All the Info I wish I had when i started out.\n\nFirst I'll do a short review and then get to the rest. I give this game a 7/10. I am loving Kingdom Wars.\n\nThere are 2 reasons it does not instantly get a 10/10 from me.\n\nFirst would be the bugs/glitches which several have been fixed since I started 2 weeks ago.The second reason is lag. The co-op lag can be severe but varies depending on who you are connecting to. Some battles are terrible while others run smooth.\n\nI have been enjoying both PVE and PVP.  The real question is it worth playing? Definately!\n\nBetween combat that reminds me of Age of Empires 2 but better and larger. City managment that feels more alive than any pure RTS. A good Economy can speed up your war machine and a bad one can cripple it.\n\nThe current 3 races are fairly well balanced with advantages to each.\n\nGAME MECHANICS\n\n-First lets start with "Protection". At the start you have 24 real time hours of protection that does not get used when you are offline. This protection prevents any player from attacking you.\n\nGiving new players the time they need to establish themselves. Once disabled protection is gone for good. (So don't disable it!!!)\n\nYou can buy more with the uniqe currency "Wealth" AKA "Crowns". You are awarded 1 Hour protection when involved in pvp battles win or lose. When Co-Oping a quest or siege the person  INVITING can have protection. The person being INVITED cannot have protection.\n\n-Buildings can level up. Up to level 5. Each level reduces cost of units, cost of technology, costs of repairs by 4% of price. It also creates units equal to the buildings current level.\n\n-Each unit can go to level 20. Each level you get 3 skill points to place in different stats such as Damage, Hit points, Health Regen, Movement speed or Resists to slashing/piercing ect. Allowing you to make extremely hard to kill Archers or a savage blitzkrieg of Melee. The choice is yours.\n\n-Heros. This special character you start with and the others you can recruit. A Dwarven Champion or a Orc Shaman to the dreaded Hydra or DRAGON!\n\nAnyone who builds/researches the right stuff can recruit these units. Each hero is immortal so they cannot die. They can be defeated or knocked out. Most Heros can reach up to level 60. Your main Hero and Wizards can go to lvl 100. A fully leveled hero is a force to be reckoned with. Each one with it's own special abilities.\n\n-The online matchmaking system requires armies be equal strength to Co-op anthing or to PVP a player. A difference of up to 10% in army strength is allowed. Meaning no new player will be met by a army of dragons and knights.\n\nArmy strength is determined by the number of units in the army, what type of unit it is and what levels they are.\n\n-After protection is off and you are attacked by a player you can pay them off instead of battling. Price varies depending on strengths and units involved.\n\n-You can make up to 5 armies at the start. Upgrading to 10 once you have joined a alliance, built a Guild Hall and researched additional armies.\n\n-Population and Caps. At first your population cap in the home city is 50 but you can research Land Plots at the town center to increase this to 90. Unforuntaly that is the cap for home.\n\nHowever armies have thier own cap which is at 60. You can have 5 armies with 300 units total cap at start and a total of 10 for 600 units in armies in late game.\n\nYou can also siege NPC cities and take them as vassals allowing you to store troops, resources or villagers in them. Greatly increasing economy, army size and storage overall.\n\n*Your gold cap is equal to the resource cap. Building houses beyond POP limit increases storage. Building additional barns increases storage cap by 1000 each.\n\n-Wealth AKA "Crowns" are the special currency of this game. You need these to build the best buildings, units & researching tech AKA The Good Stuff.\n\nYou get crowns for winning or losing in pvp the amount is significant but varies depending on the size of armies involved. Sieges of cities in the open world (NPC cities) can reward significant amounts of crowns and resources.\n\nEach quest awards 4 crowns and clearing a area of enemys completely rewards 1 crown. There is also a daily reward for logging in which varies but you can get 1 crown instead.\n\nAll of which is doubled if you upgrade to a premium account. Crowns flow once you get established.\n\nGUIDE FOR NEW PLAYERS\n\nI am a Human so some things may be human specific but I will try to keep it as general as I can.\n\n-With 24 hours of protection. No player can attack you. Focus on your economy. With the newest patch your gatherers gain resources 10x faster than usual at the start and that slows to normal the further you get. So you can do less then what I suggest (or do it for a awesome economy).\n\n-Create 3 villagers at your town hall (you start with it) and create a barn at the same time.\n\n-Once the barn is built. Begin by making 5 pigs and then a total of 7 groups of villagers. Assign each villager to livestock.\n\nWhen you click on a unit thier picture shows in bottom left around the picture are symbols for actions or if the unit has formations, special abilites ect. In villagers case you can assign it to take care of livestock.\n\nThis is the fastest way to create food at your home city. Cows and Fields are slower overall. Fields and Bushes are not available in winter. Cows are slow to develop and produce less than pigs.\n\nWhen you have a steady food supply keep making more villagers. To have a great economy you will need 30-35 villagers to cover all tasks.\n\n-Assign 10 villagers to cutting wood. If you prefer archers over melee you may want to go after more wood but with economic boost (which I never experianced) I don't think more will be needed. Even my current numbers may be overkill. Lucky new people XD\n\n-When it comes to mining I prefer Gold. I have met some who have focused on stone and then sold stone for gold. I suggest assigning 10 villagers to Gold mining and another 5 villagers to Stone mining. Each lump of stone or gold on the map in your city can support 2 villagers mining it.\n\nRemember to make a horse cart from your barn and place it nearby any mining operations. The horse cart acts as a supply drop point. Keeping one near any group of gatherers prevents them from walking all the way back to the town hall to drop what they gather. You do not need one for livestock as long as you keep them near the town center.\n\nNow you should have a Excellent Economy and ready to build your barracks, archery and stable. I recommend starting with the barracks. I prefer swordsmen over maces they are more expensive but easier to keep alive. Also a all around better unit.\n\nI suggest 4 units to do quests in home area. 12 units total to do quests safely outside home area. Players new to RTS games should x2 those amounts and veterans won't need this XD.\n\nTIPS & TRICKS\n\nYou don't need walls or soldiers in the home city. Have no walls and only villagers. Keep soldiers outside of town in armies. Most people don't use armies with 75 Strength (75villagers would be 75 str keep 15 empty to build soldiers and heal damaged units) and it is cheap to pay off enemies when they attack. Best economy in the game but no defensive siege battles until you have vassals.\n\nArmies don't have to be just a army. Create a army of villagers, make a camp and assign them to chopping wood or mining gold. A group of horse carts to haul the loot you get after sieging a enemy or clearing a area. The cart army returns to base doing a supply run as you siege another location.\n\nMake a camp in enemy land. You can hire enemy racial units as mercenaries.\n\n2 weeks of knowledge crammed into a TL;DR review... If you feel pity for this nerd please use my reference code once in this great game.

There nothing that isn't bugged in this game it has bugged quest that get so bad that it just breaks your whole town forcing you to delete it, and start a new. Like the first quet for the orc race which wants you to lore a orger into a spike trap after completeing it the spike trap suppose to disppaer, but it doesn't an everytime one of your workers or warriors walks over it it completely kills them everytime, and the orger respawn in your town killing you workers, and warriors everytime you reload your town. Then there pathfind bugs siege units get stuck on walls units get stuck climbing siege ladder or just stop moving for the reset of an instance if they some how survie a spike trap. Then Fire really annoying your troops will run into, and try to attack it for some reason, and even when it gone your unit still take damage when there in the area that was on fire. There some werid gather bug that just start in the most recent patch it took me 3 hours to collect 2 pieaces of wood when i had 10 workers try to cut wood. It should be 3-15 wood every sec depend on research or amount of workers. There also a bug with the ingame currency were you'll just randomly lose all of it for no reason so don't pay really cash on crowns cause you will lose them for no reason. Also you can gain crowns from PVP/PVE, but that also bugged 60% of the time your not reward with them after a match. An this is only about 1/5 of the bugs in the game there many more like treants bugged movement speed sometime they have a movement speed of 9999 they'll be so fast they just teleport across the battle field other time they have a movement speed of 2 they move so slow it takes them 3 hours to get across a map. There also a bug with the single player were it will say your cheating, and are unable to play the single player. The best bug so far is this extremely annoying bug that will just roll back your whole town to what it was when you started it when you get attack by another player, and the devs say this is a very rare which is Bull-**** cause it happen to about 15 people everyday which compared to the fact that 1000-1500 people login every day it about 1% of the population. So after 20 days 20% of the population town has been completely rolled back to the begining.  An the Devs are useless they don't fix bugs they take forever to post on the forums, hell there was one time were the devs didn't post anything on there website for 6 months striaght. People just started saying the game shutting down on there forums, and they didn't reply to any of thos post what they did do was delete thos post when they started posting on there site again. An for some reason the Devs are ban happy as it stands banning people for no reason at all. So overall don't waste your money on this game if you want to play it to see how buggy it is your self then just wait for it to go F2P/P2W.","August 20, 2014","false","152.1"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

I was very surprised to find that i couldnt even play a skirmish without paying, while i can understand the developers need to make money, i wouldn't call it free to play if 3/4 of the features require actual money. A good example of an ACTUAL free to play is Neverwinter; every single ounce of content is free, even the things you can only get with special items is still achievable using multiple methods in the game, on top of that it's solid, fun, addictive and satisfying gameplay and story. So while im very into Kingdom Wars i think making it fully free to play or even just unlocking the skirmish modes would bolster the popularity and reception of the game.","November 10, 2014","true","26.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Kingdom Wars actually gives you a bit of background on what's going on in the world. A reason to go out and conquer.  Being the huge nerd that I am, I am part of a renaissance group who studies and reenacts historical battles in real life. I like the diversity of figthers and fighting styles. Halbreders are good against horses, sword men with shields are good against defending arrows and so on. This gives battle a bit more realism for me.  On top of that there is customization to your heros and armies and it's not rediculously expensive to do so. This is one of the few free to play games I acutally put money into customization because I know I will play it for awhile. There is a slight lack of options in the customization department but it is a young game still and I am sure that will grow.

I have tried doing the quest to trade cows and I cannot seem to get it to finish. Maybe i am doing something wrong but I feel it could be something to work on either way. That however would really be my only complaint so far. The game is fun and I love that I can build a castle for myself.

This is one of the few games that don't build hype to let players down. Theres not much pay to win, theres a great ballance with the units of the game, and all in all its a strong well crafted idea which I can very much put in 50 - 80 hours into this game.\n\nI do gotta say alot of the times rts are more like a gamble then strategy and this game is more of a gamble situation. Basically during battle the enemies have a range of aggro and thats really about it. I don't mind that as any war is a gamble of strength, luck, and some strategy and manuvering involved and this does put this very well.\n\nThere is one otherthing that might be a bug is that the selection rectangle stays on the screen sometimes when you select a unit. Not a game breaker but it is a glitch they should look into.\n\nSo far they have troop training as you enter cities, looting corpses with civs, and buying mercs and selling loot you get from enemies.\n\nThe map is quite big and you can coop or even vs enemy players in segies and other pvp battles. I haven't got to test that part out yet, but you basically get your own map to your self to train your army anyway. Mount and blade strategy meet rts for the first time! It is defeently one of the more interesting games that i've seen and as a avid gamer, I am quite picky about what I play.\n\nI hope this helps!","November 7, 2014","true","19.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Controlling your army, and leveling them up on the over world is great fun, building your city and aquiring upgrades also plays out well. The timers on building buildings don't hit as hard as I initially thought they would, with twenty minute build timers on some of the larger buildings passing by quickly as I focus on other portions of the game\n\nI have to say, that by far, BY FAR, i enjoyed the first part of the game the most, the psuedo tutorial. Running around with my hero and a few units, clearing my lands from bandits, coming back to find a messenger had arrived, or a lord wanted me to do something was thrilling and immersive.\n\nThe game looks fantastic for how many units are on the screen at once, and every battle I find myself Roleplaying as my hero, and ordering my units to take the field and feeling the loss of every man in all of my squads.\n\nThe only thing I really dislike are the crown earning systems, I find the process too slow, where PvP may net you the most crowns the fastest, that can come at the total loss of your army (save for maybe one or two units if you are lucky), which means it's back to the drawing board to re level up your units. (You can also buy your units levels at nearby towns with in game gold)\n\nYou could also take your leveled army, and farm the overworld maps for crowns, but after the third run through of a map, I find myself getting tired of the same placement of units, the same patrol paths, the same spawn point. Vary up the maps a bit more, is all I ask, make the single player overworld a bit more varied for map selection, instead of relying on the same one or two exactly the same maps per section.\n\nIt's a great free to play game if you are into city builders with PvP elements.

Especially since it is free, right? Unlike most game's that are free, this one also comes with the guarantee that it isn't pay to win. Wait one second. Free game not being pay to win? That's right! Paying in game with hard currency does not give you an outrageous advantage over people who choose not to pay and many options are simply for visual effects like battle standard and the like. Ha I'm gonna make my army bear the picture of an electric guitar. What? There weren't electric guitars back then? Darn.\n\nWell anyways, This game is in my words: "A more drawn out MMO version on Age of Empires." Set in the medieval time period. Here you get to build your city, raise armies, capture enemy strongholds then choosing whether to control them or simply plunder them, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. As for you mythical lovers, there's also dragons, and wizards, and dwarves, Oh my! Choosing between three races is pretty cool, but here you can also select unique traits to focus your race on. Let's see here... Orcs with reduced market rates and prices? Umm no. I'll take combat mastery and take the goods I want by force haha. Fear me you peasants! Ah sorry, I let my power hungry self out again... Let's continue shall we? I don't know about you but with over 20 enemy cities to siege, 3 regions for each race with other unexplored territories, and the ability to enter the world on any part of the map for different experiences, there is clearly a nice feeling of change to keep you refreshed. There is also a very competitive player versus player system as this being it's main aspect and a great co-op feel, although it beautifully sows player versus environment elements into the game even giving the option to quest and play the game solo.\n\nWhile the game still has many bugs (many of them being quite annoying), it is completely compensated by the amazing staff that keeps the game afloat. I've never seen a game change and advance as quickly as it has to find and fix problems affecting everyone and even problems affecting one person! One bug here, next day solved. Great game you must give it a try it is truly the next RTS brought to life. It's here... And it's evolving as we speak.\n\nTill next time,\nCanine (In-game name: FrozenSteel, Referal code: REF1100001083111D8)","November 7, 2014","true","135.6"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

You don't have to pay. You only pay for the game with everything in it. Nothing forces you to pay. Not sure if that feature is still in the game though.\n\nAlso I saw one review saying that you have to join the game by signing up on their website. That is not true although You have to register ingame and then receive an confirmation email for you to complete the registeration. This process do not take more than two minutes. You are required to do this in order to play the game online with friends and others. That's it.\n\nAnyway my review...\n\nOverall and ongoing, it is a fun game. I enjoy playing against AIs enemies as well as players whilst doing the storyline. I use the term, storyline, very loosely because it is almost very direct but you can do the quests whenever and in your own time. Yes, the game can and should have been better than what it is at the moment but I don't complain because it is a decent game.\n\nHowever it can be ugly due to cutscenes when you have conversations with some certain characters in the "storyline." The characters, by looking very closely, they look like they came from 90s games like Castle Strike or the old Warcraft series unless I forget to improve the graphics in the settings lol but that is manageable anyway because you don't look that closely often.\n\nOverall, I would say this is 7/10. Better than some games but could have been better.","March 16, 2014","true","32.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

And you get rewarded for daily log-ins!\n-If you are a rich and prosperping player, you might be able to pay them off with gold or stone, etc.\n-Feels like Stronghold - but without the pesky tasks of "cleaning up gong" or "peseants stealing from our granery sire"\n-Mobile armies: You can build a force and level them through campsites and taking on enemies in the wilderness around you, making you stronger and your units stronger for battles to come.\n-Well designed lore of castles and beautiful landscapes.\n-No "PayToWin": As they say in the news on the game "this game is designed to avoid the pitfalls of FreeToPlay games....focusing more on skill and persistance than bigger wallets"\n\n\nCons:\n-Very wonky (slow) combat. You have to make sure you units don`t get stuck and cluttered as they will get moved over by the smallest force if you`re not careful.\n-Co-op is not as smooth as I had hoped, while you can send supplies to your friend, getting them to play with you to aid in a quest or seige is a bit frustraing if you dont pay close attention to what you are selecting.\n-Npc workers [peasants, etc] tend to get stuck up in hills or behiind fences when chopping down trees.\n-The initial title screen has very LOUD audio - first tiime players make sure your audio is turned down some or your ears will get blasted away. While this is epic sounding, if any player has their volume up they might get quite a surpize once the tittle screen loads.\n-Slow loading screens between transitions. [ While this really isn`t a *con* it can be annoying waiting for that bar to load up when there is little to nothing in your home city to load ] Another transition issue is between begining to seige and actually entering the seige. These problems are on and off, and while I havea solid internet this *may* vary between players.\n\nOverall this game as great potential to kick out Stronghold and its gong-infested cities and brings forth a potential for a shining sheild in castle-sim-like games.\n","December 29, 2014","true","38.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

[Like path of exile!]\n\nWell, This is one of those game, And It's free.\n\nAfter years, Not alot of players get an opportunity of a decent gameplay where everything does not prevent them from trying to advance in the game.\n\nThe best thing is currently about this game is;\n\n- The developers do interact with the players once the while, thus making the game much more enjoyable for the players\n- Instead of going the dull ol' fashioned where in Starcraft 2, You have to rebuild from ground one, You can skip that.\n- There are three races in the game; The human, The Elves and the orc. They have their own way of survivals, Learn it.\n-  Got dwarves. All race can have 'em. Dwarves. Dragons too.\n- There is no literal pay to win feature. Those who do think there is, is just thinking pessimistic. The reality is the Crown systems does not prevent pay to win, rather Crowns can be obtained via having vassal towns, Players Versues Players, completing quests, and clearing reigons of NPC. The crowns are essential to many mechanic of the game to unlock better equipments and building upgrades that will determine the player's activity in PvP and PvE. In addition that the only two things that are locked are Skrimishes and Single Player Campagin, but those two do not influence the direct gameplay of original. becuase Single player campagin will be the same as MMO-verisoned, The difference is no player versues players and does not requires internet connection. Skrimishes on other hand is a 'Testing Ground', Where you trains your tactic and you can use said tactics to your gameplay, but It won't influence the gameplay via units, resources or any means. rather just a training ground.\n- CO-OP Player versues Environment, Your best friend can help you take on Dagbor!\n\n\nThe downsides, however. . .\n\nThe Downsides only not so permanent and may be gone in next updates, and some downsides are from the player's gamestyle.\n\n- The game have bad server hosting, Meaning you can accidently lose connection or reception to the server. The worst to experience is a rollback, however you can solve it by validating the game via Steam, And If it does not solve, then you can go to game's file and go to the game's forum, then place down the Log 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 into the techinal support thread and state what happened to you.\n- The players will alway use a wizard of the Deep. The Wizard of the deep is the wizard designed for player veruses players combat and will wreck most of your army. It's expensive immortal [Immortals unit cannot die, They will lose a few level, but they cannot be killed permanently.] unit that cost at most 120 crowns, excluding the cost to get the spells required. The Wizard of the deep can be a major turnoff for many players who are forced to face them in combat because It's designed to destroy majority of army before wizard get defeated.\n- Lack of players also make community small. only 150 players strong per day, and sometime peaking 200, and lowest is 95. The community is not average toxic, and can be friendly at most time. Some players are willing to assist you in understanding the game mechanic, but most are usually quiet and/or the chatbox is not working for them. It's the common issue in the server host connection that Chatbox servers does not connect successfully to the other players sometime and breaks, Not allowing the players to communicate with the community.","December 25, 2014","true","68.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

You manage a small village which, slowly, grows to metropolis. You have to decide on whats best for your village, paying off bandits, or deciding where to build the new blacksmith. The town is tailored to your design, be ye human, filthy orc, or hippy elf. The games graphics are pretty good considering the amount of individual units  each moving. You can see it at its best in the environmental changes, the winter was nice thing to in the game, although not for my peasants who were unable to plow the fields.\n\nAlthough the game does have its fair share of bugs mostly in the ai. The most notable were my peasants choosing to drop resources at my keep instead of a cart which was right next to them, and a dragon swarmed by footmen trying to attack my dragon slayer in the back stuck and not attempting to attack anything else. My least favorite thing about the game is the fact that you have pay money in order to have additional towns with a different race. It saddens me that i can't even try out another race without paying 5 $ or deleting my first town, im fine that you can buy boosters (Its not pay to win, you are matched against players with equal army strength) but atleast let me try the other races.\n\nOverall a fun free game 8.5/10","November 2, 2014","true","22.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The races are well different to make them unique (unlike just changing the units a little bit, each race has different mechanics, which is a must for any great RTS). The Microtransaction shop seems to sell some pretty nice customization for your town, + I love the way the whole game works by having a main town to work around, instead of building a settlement in one match than a new one in a later match. The map seems to be well done and different from area to area (seems like there are some unpopulated areas that may be used for future races, but I can't tell). The graphcis are nice.

With the recent launch of their Free to Play experience I've spent the last few days catching up on all the changes.\n\nGame Details:This is a long term City Building Game with a RTS Campaign Map / Battlefield Map with PvE and PvP aspects.\nCity Building:\n- This plays like any resource cap / population cap / building plot game.\n- You establish an economy of food / wood / stone and gold.\n- You use these resources (along with renown) to build better buildings / defenses and units.\n- You also upgrade your technology and other improvements.\nCampaign Map:\n- The map has the 3 racial zones along with NPC and Endgame Zones.\n- Here you move your armies around which open up the various gameplay elements.\n- You can trade by actually loading up an army with transports and resources/currency and moving them to an NPC town you would like to trade with.  Each town opens up to you as you advance your influence.\n- You can also battle the NPC towns and make them 'vassals' of your main town.\n- You can enter open world combat (instanced random map based on your location) along with building various camps to provide a defensive start to these combat areas.\n- The map does not show the thousands of other player cities, however you can engage in PvP matches or sieges.\nBattle Map:\n- Here is where you (in real time) engage in troop movements and combat.\n- This plays like a simplified Total War game with basic unit based formations.\n- The actual units themselves have a bit more complexity and individuality due to ranks and the way you can upgrade them.Review:Overall this is a fun, laid back type of game that you can log in for a few minutes or hours and feel accomplished. City Building:\n- I like the graphics, turned all the way up there are some nice lighting and textures.  This is not 'the best looking' game, however they have done well enough to keep immersion.  My only complaint is with how they implemented lightning during storms.\n- The plots are pre planed (so you build walls, and they show up where the walls should go).  You do get some choice in where to build specific buildings, but you still must choose predefined locations.  This took some getting used to and I'm not sure that I like it. Orcs can build anywhere if this is your thing.\n- The three races give distinct city building and resource gathering flavors.  With that said there are more than 1 way to acquire any of the required resources.  I like this.\n- City building is a long term game.  Things continue when you are logged off; and once you've spent your resources for the day there is little left to do here.  This is great for the quick maintenance fix it seems I have with games.\n- This quick logon goes well with daily booster rewards.\nWorld Map:\n- I like the style of the world map.  The art flavor for the different zones makes it easy to tell what area you are looking at.  With that said, the map is smaller than I would like.\n- I also think they got the army movement speed right, where it is not instant; giving you a sense of distance; while not taking forever and a day to cross the map.\n- Beyond that, not much to say about the world map.  It provides access to the game functions.\nBattle Map:\n- I really enjoy that you can take an army out, go to a zone that has whatever you like to fight, and then engage in whatever type of combat that you like.  This gives the 30+ minute gameplay angle.\n- You can decide to farm if that is your thing (resources, experience, even units).\n- The rock / paper / scissors unit types work well.  There is enough variety that you can get the gameplay you enjoy.\n- I wish that grouped units had more formation control.\n- Since you can upgrade specific aspects (such as resistance) of the units you have, you can create shock troops or a tanky army.  I like the variety.\n\nNo pvp comments as I've not gotten there yet.","November 6, 2014","true","168.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Ok, I'm a newb, just a few hours played.   Look at it this way, I have over 50 games in steam, haven't played more than a day in most of them, this one, I'm on my 3rd day.  I like the art.  I like having quests mainly because I'm retired and old and don't want to think too much.  I seem to have a little trouble with losing workers somewhere and haven't figured how to find them yet.  I'd like more tooltips with more info, I'd like to pause without logging out if no one's attacking me.... just because going pee (I'm old, it takes a while and often) and you come back and whatever you killed quest-wise has resurrected (it took me a while to figure out you gotta finish any quests you start before logging out, I was thinking I was having a senior moment and never really did what I thought I did -- which is scary)  I do feel like I need LOTS more direction and explaination.

I had to get the walls built, I needed to build that army, I needed to siege  that city. This game has improved more than I could have imagined since then. I literally bought it a second time because I couldnt resist, Now after a year and a half break I am back. I was able to import all of my old cities and pick up right where I left off. This game is great in the RTS aspect. Lots of units, versatile factions, even the ability to conquer other cities. It also has great strategy becaus every unit has a weakness, but it also a strong point which could help to change the tide of a battle. I recommend this game to anyone who is looking for an enjoyable, laid back, RTS. The mods are great and the community is a lot of fun.

It's like Total War, but Total War never shows its awesome growing base on LIVE not like on KW !! And the Changing weather effects in the Game ? Like Snow, Raining, Storm, etc... KINDA AWESOME !! And watching your town growing, your peasants working, your laborers making stuffs and something like that, It's a mixed Strategy Game ! And  the best part they've done in the game is, they made it F2P (Free2Play), I've been playing for 16+ Hours because it's kinda Addictive, if You're a Strategic game fan i don't know if you're gonna like this game or not, but to me, It's Awesome...

Keep in mind, this game was new at the time and was still getting sorted out. I played for 100+ hours in the first week, It brought me in and it kept me wanting to come back and play more. I had to get the walls built, I needed to build that army, I needed to siege  that city. This game has improved more than I could have imagined since then. I literally bought it a second time because I couldnt resist, Now after a year and a half break I am back. I was able to import all of my old cities and pick up right where I left off. This game is great in the RTS aspect. Lots of units, versatile factions, even the ability to conquer other cities. It also has great strategy becaus every unit has a weakness, but it also a strong point which could help to change the tide of a battle. I recommend this game to anyone who is looking for an enjoyable, laid back, RTS. The mods are great and the community is a lot of fun. This is a game thatcould get you hooked.","November 4, 2014","true","46.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I guess once you lvl up your units it will somewhat blend in as there are caps...\n\nMain types of people you can play ORCS, Elfs and Human. I play Human as my main and Orcs... I hate elves!!!\n\nIt is not a Pay to win game as it has a system to match people up to somewhat equal balance. The graphics are great, now I have a power house machines so I can't really speak if there is lag or Frame rate issues as I get max all the time. The map and fights are pretty dynamic and if you are a Total War fan this might be your game!! It is also a full RTS game no turn base crap which is nice. I have a O.K army with 1 Red Dragon and a few Minotaurs LOVE Minotaurs. Most people have a lot of playing methods. lots of people like Archers and some like things that can run fast and destroy Archers like Minotaurs hehe. Your Kingdom is setup in such a way that if you get a attacked you have a chance to win if you play smart. You will always retain your Castle if you lose and it is pretty easy to fix it back up.  I would suggest playing solo a few matches to see what your base can do and find the weaknesses.\n\nThere are plenty of people so lvling up makes it easy. You can lvl up really fast so don't think you will be left behind, this games some what take care of that weakness really good. They have units that you can buy with crowns find out what type of fighter you want to be then unless your power...\n\n\nCrowns that word can be scary but like I said this is not a Pay to win game.... So you can earn crowns pretty easy by fighting and doing all the quest... Now I hope the devs still do this, but they are know to give out 100 crowns for just being nice in chat.... or helping others, I have received close to 300 crowns in total over the years.\n\nDevs,, they listen for the most part and seem to have a great connection to the chat channels, patches come out pretty quick and all the extra content is free.\n\nPS there is a way to have to have a full Dwarf Army very bad ♥♥♥. I have 50% full army now that I am lvling up.\n\nThank for reading my wall of text.....

It is a slow, complex game, though that's not to say it's any more complex than your average RTS. Starting the game the first time has a steep learning curve of about 7 hours. You have to learn all your normal RTS things like what buildings can go where to make what, what upgrades are available to each unit, basic economy & tactics, etc. But then there is an overworld map, quests, army management, sieges, and a tight constraint on crowns/influence, which is the reward for beating quests and winning combat and absolutely necessary not only for research but for special units, too. And consider this: there is a PvP element, which you either can bypass by paying off the attacker or engage and risk your units, and either way you can only rest safe for one hour of in-game time before you can attack/be attacked again. So you start off with 24 hours of in-game PvP protection. Just 24 game hours to prepare for PvP.\n\nPvE is all about quests and getting crowns/influence through quests and battling on the overworld (think random battles from older Final Fantasy games but you choose when & where.) One big flaw is the cumbersome quest system which makes you inch your way over the worldmap to the quest giver's city and then load the city map and then wait while your hero runs across the city to the quest giver. And turning in a quest often results in another one being available, but you have to exit the city and enter it again, walk your hero back to the quest giver and get the next quest in the chain. Most quests are repetitive, and don't directly scale in difficulty. You will often have to fight two armies, seige two cities, etc. and both often occur on the same map, but you have to, again, inch your way over the overworld map to get from point to point. Now the idea behind this is while one army is moving up to four additional armies can be deployed as well. This makes it possible to split your forces and multi-task on the world map, building an ever bigger collective army.\n\nBattles can be quick, though. I got to a point in the quests where I decided I would have my hero kill eveything solo, and that takes forever. But if you don't go Hero vs. World, seiging a castle can be quick, routing an army can be quick, it all depends on your playstyle and how much you risk your units, if you worry about looting every penny, spending every skill point asap, etc.\n\nThis is the kind of game like OgreBattle where you can easily drop 80 hours and not even see a fraction of what there is to achieve in the game. This game is a place to escape reality and become absorbed in the fantasy RTS game, with the added pluses and minuses of PvP. There are so many details, potential strategies, and an ever unlocking complexity that keeps you learning well past the 30 hours I've put into this game so far. Despite the flaws, it is easy to get absorbed. Come and stay. We don't bite - much. :)","November 2, 2014","true","83.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

You are given quests that you can follow for rewards, and get you familiarized with the game. In the beginning you are placed in a status with a timer that counts down, and after the amount of ingame hours expire you can now be attacked by armies of relatively the same strength as your own\n\nOr\n\nYou can avoid the quests, try and build your army and city your own way, go on the march, start pvp by turning off the protective status mode, going on a coop raid of a city. Whatever you decide to do, the beginning may feel a little harsh because the gathering process feels really slow until you get everything rolling. Your units keep gathering resources while you are offline and there are daily rewards mailed to your in-game bank.\n\nThe game has a sort of "Knights of Honor" and "Warcraft 3" feel to it.\n\nKOH because: There are some diplomacy aspects that can be done with the NPC cities like giving gifts and trading with them to improve relations. NPC cities that you defeat can either be looted for additional resources or placed into vassalage under your command and there are alliances that can be made with other players. When fighting you go into  a zoomed in view where you command you units in the field, give them direct orders of where to attack, what types of formations to use, as well as special abilities that each unit may have. Units can be hot keyed 1-9 on the battlefield to make it easier to bounce between your units. What I like, is that you can mix and match your army for some variety, like taming ogres, or hiring other races as mercenaries to fight for you. There is alot of building that needs to be done to improve your cities defense, offensive capabilites, resource gathering and storage. The buildings also have upgrades on them that can give your units bonuses. There is a population cap in your city depending on the number of houses you build, and different units require different amounts of population requirements, like a dragon requires 10 open slots while knights or archers require 1 slot. You gain veterancy on your units, the more they fight and survive the more levels they will earn. Every level awards 3 points to spend on attack, defense, health cap, stamina cap, or health regen.\n\nWarcraft 3 because: As a Realtime strategy that is going on, you have peasant type gatherers, melee units that focus on slashing, crushing and piercing damage. Ranged piercing damage that can be done by archers, there are elite units that you can make like the: tribal shaman, high knight, wizards, multiple types of dragons, while all expensive units to buy, if they fall in battle they will not disappear like a regular unit would. they will just be unavailable till the end of the fight, and then be back in your army again with low health and acouple of veterancy levels lost as a death penalty.\n\n\nThe three races you can play as are:\nOrcs (can build goblin units),\nElves (wood elf and high elf)\nand Humans (can build dwarven units).\n\nThey all have differences about them, like the range of archers, the defense and offense of melee units, special abilities like heals, hiding and beserk. It all puts a little spin on which race you decide to use.\n\n\nThis game is free to play, with a sort of booster shop available in game. You can get the boosters if you want, it will help you get to a more advanced city status quicker, but has a 1 time purchase ability for your city. Its not necessary in order to be competitive or anything like that, it just gives you some gold, and some exta crowns that are required to upgrade some buildings and build advanced strucures and units. You earn the crowns from fights and quests, but the booster and the "premium" status you can pay for will give you some bonus rewards, again not necessary, just available if your the type that has no patience and wants to try and speed things along.\n\nPros:\nThe game as it stands right now is a tremendous amount of fun for me. There is a pretty active community and I like how the story and questing is going, the random coop sieges, the quest battle requests, and the occasional invading enemy army that I either buy off to leave me alone for a while or engage. Different playstyles for different people can be tried out in the skirmish mode. Its like fighting with your army and trying out different tactics without the consequences of losing them in a fight by trying something different. Like I have fought with someone that had an army the same strength as mine but he used only ogres, another used all cavalry sprinkled with some archers. Infantry with cannons. Minotaurs with trebuchets, you name it, alot of variety in what you can use. I like how it only faces you against people that have around the same strength, so your not getting beat down on by the people that have been playing longer than you have. The moderators, like the game masters are always in the chat channel, and can be asked questions anytime in the help channel. They'll offer advice on questions you may have about using units, and suggestions if something with the game is working properly.\n\nCons:\nThe game can seem slow in the beginning. It is meticulous with alot of micromanaging that needs to be done, both in battle and in your town. Building up the wealth required to buy some of the units can be difficult in the beginning of the game if you dont follow the quest line. There have been afew issues that I have seen in chat channel about some people losing some units from their army after the last update, but the Mods have been helping people out. The zoomed in quest giver view, like when you see you character up close and personal when he/she in talking to a quest giver, you can see that they dont look so good, I guess there wasn't alot of emphasis on the polish of the quest givers but not a really big deal. There is also some lag when you are doing a coop battle with someone or logging in, you'll see it get choppy for afew seconds before it smooths out.\n\nWell I hope this has helped out with Your decision to play this game. If you are a fan of RTS games I would highly recommend this to you. It's free to download and free to play, I go by the name Ish in game so maybe I'll see you there.","November 2, 2014","true","270.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Cycle icons or timers on research and production. there is already a black loading icon but with some research i press the button and its either instant or is researching slowly, either way i cannot tell if its been researched or is researching. maybe grey out the button or say "researched already" e.g the mill, irrigation i researched but it still remains there showing the purchase amount but its no longer clickable, ok i know it means its worked but to others they might click it and go...well what now?\n6: the mouse feels like it lags when clicking things, sometimes it wont select a unit liturally right behind another unit or when you attack they will walk, maybe a toggle run button too but mainly the way the mouse feels. it seems to feel like its lagging when clicking. or you have to multiple click somethings a few times.\n7:the female hero after leaving the capital then returning will spawn, when it auto walks to the return way point it walks with a broken graphics, looking like its legs are were its arms are and its arms right outwards with the sword pointing outwards.\n\n\nkeep up the good work!","November 2, 2014","true","32.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

That said, I spent 20$ on this game a year ago and I have never regretted it. Now that it's free, there is zero reason why you shouldn't at least try this game :D It took me 75 hours and about 4 months of playing to get one built up city and I haven't even touched the other two races yet, so needless to say this game will occupy you for a while. Also zero pay to win advantages, everything is aesthetic.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/_NYX_/recommended/227180/","_NYX_","kimot3l","http://steamcommunity.com/id/_NYX_/","68 products in account","Kingdom Wars is a very interesting game. At first I had a very low opinion of it, but if you can overcome the first hour of the game and look past its shortcomings you'll find a very addictive experience with so much potential.\n\n\nNegative impressions: Visually it looks as if it made in the early 2000s, and the combat leaves a lot to be desired. Once battle is joined unit formations devolve into disorganized mosh-pit like globs with very poor unit collision detection (if any at all.) The animations are primitive and very basic, not just in combat but for walking, idle, and cutscenes dialog. There are also a host of bugs, many of which are highly destructive and infuriating. The worst I encountered was when I lost an entire army, 28 units, because a quest sent them into a void and left me with an empty army on the map- without even starting the quest. I was left without my hero unit, and an entire day worth of invested resources that I used to build said army.\n\nPositive Impressions: The economic system and a load of fun, and by far the best part of the game aside from the general idea. You can make profits by trading, harvesting resources, looting battlefields, and questing. Each option presents its own benefits and challenges. If you decide to harvest resources at home then you will looking at the safest and most reliable way, but it also means you need peasants working the land which drags on your unit cap. Trade is the quickest way, but it also means you’re at risk of losing caravans and thus your cargo. It also requires more management and the natural risk of losing money on a trade if you’re too hasty.\n\nThe game has a pretty mild pace, which is certainly a positive in my opinion. You won’t become powerful overnight, and all buildings and soldiers take quite a bit of resources and time to make. There is also a healthy variety of units and plenty of defining traits to pick from. Units gain experience from battles which lets you upgrade them, in addition to researching new technologies and equipment. From what I can tell there is no pay-to-win advantage either. The cashhop is purely aesthetics and speeding up the process of questing rewards.\n\nIf the combat would be overhauled then I think this would be an easy game to recommend, and if animations and visuals where modernized then it would be a jewel. However as it stands it’s a give and take. If you can overlook its issues there is a lot of fun to be had, but not everyone can do that.\n","November 1, 2014","true","1.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

And you get rewarded for daily log-ins!\n-If you are a rich and prosperping player, you might be able to pay them off with gold or stone, etc.\n-Feels like Stronghold - but without the pesky tasks of "cleaning up gong" or "peseants stealing from our granery sire"\n-Mobile armies: You can build a force and level them through campsites and taking on enemies in the wilderness around you, making you stronger and your units stronger for battles to come.\n-Well designed lore of castles and beautiful landscapes.\n-No "PayToWin": As they say in the news on the game "this game is designed to avoid the pitfalls of FreeToPlay games....focusing more on skill and persistance than bigger wallets"\n\n\nCons:\n-Very wonky (slow) combat. You have to make sure you units don`t get stuck and cluttered as they will get moved over by the smallest force if you`re not careful.\n-Co-op is not as smooth as I had hoped, while you can send supplies to your friend, getting them to play with you to aid in a quest or seige is a bit frustraing if you dont pay close attention to what you are selecting.\n-Npc workers [peasants, etc] tend to get stuck up in hills or behiind fences when chopping down trees.\n-The initial title screen has very LOUD audio - first tiime players make sure your audio is turned down some or your ears will get blasted away. While this is epic sounding, if any player has their volume up they might get quite a surpize once the tittle screen loads.\n-Slow loading screens between transitions. [ While this really isn`t a *con* it can be annoying waiting for that bar to load up when there is little to nothing in your home city to load ] Another transition issue is between begining to seige and actually entering the seige. These problems are on and off, and while I havea solid internet this *may* vary between players.\n\nOverall this game as great potential to kick out Stronghold and its gong-infested cities and brings forth a potential for a shining sheild in castle-sim-like games.\n","December 29, 2014","true","38.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

[Like path of exile!]\n\nWell, This is one of those game, And It's free.\n\nAfter years, Not alot of players get an opportunity of a decent gameplay where everything does not prevent them from trying to advance in the game.\n\nThe best thing is currently about this game is;\n\n- The developers do interact with the players once the while, thus making the game much more enjoyable for the players\n- Instead of going the dull ol' fashioned where in Starcraft 2, You have to rebuild from ground one, You can skip that.\n- There are three races in the game; The human, The Elves and the orc. They have their own way of survivals, Learn it.\n-  Got dwarves. All race can have 'em. Dwarves. Dragons too.\n- There is no literal pay to win feature. Those who do think there is, is just thinking pessimistic. The reality is the Crown systems does not prevent pay to win, rather Crowns can be obtained via having vassal towns, Players Versues Players, completing quests, and clearing reigons of NPC. The crowns are essential to many mechanic of the game to unlock better equipments and building upgrades that will determine the player's activity in PvP and PvE. In addition that the only two things that are locked are Skrimishes and Single Player Campagin, but those two do not influence the direct gameplay of original. becuase Single player campagin will be the same as MMO-verisoned, The difference is no player versues players and does not requires internet connection. Skrimishes on other hand is a 'Testing Ground', Where you trains your tactic and you can use said tactics to your gameplay, but It won't influence the gameplay via units, resources or any means. rather just a training ground.\n- CO-OP Player versues Environment, Your best friend can help you take on Dagbor!\n\n\nThe downsides, however. . .\n\nThe Downsides only not so permanent and may be gone in next updates, and some downsides are from the player's gamestyle.\n\n- The game have bad server hosting, Meaning you can accidently lose connection or reception to the server. The worst to experience is a rollback, however you can solve it by validating the game via Steam, And If it does not solve, then you can go to game's file and go to the game's forum, then place down the Log 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 into the techinal support thread and state what happened to you.\n- The players will alway use a wizard of the Deep. The Wizard of the deep is the wizard designed for player veruses players combat and will wreck most of your army. It's expensive immortal [Immortals unit cannot die, They will lose a few level, but they cannot be killed permanently.] unit that cost at most 120 crowns, excluding the cost to get the spells required. The Wizard of the deep can be a major turnoff for many players who are forced to face them in combat because It's designed to destroy majority of army before wizard get defeated.\n- Lack of players also make community small. only 150 players strong per day, and sometime peaking 200, and lowest is 95. The community is not average toxic, and can be friendly at most time. Some players are willing to assist you in understanding the game mechanic, but most are usually quiet and/or the chatbox is not working for them. It's the common issue in the server host connection that Chatbox servers does not connect successfully to the other players sometime and breaks, Not allowing the players to communicate with the community.","December 25, 2014","true","68.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

You manage a small village which, slowly, grows to metropolis. You have to decide on whats best for your village, paying off bandits, or deciding where to build the new blacksmith. The town is tailored to your design, be ye human, filthy orc, or hippy elf. The games graphics are pretty good considering the amount of individual units  each moving. You can see it at its best in the environmental changes, the winter was nice thing to in the game, although not for my peasants who were unable to plow the fields.\n\nAlthough the game does have its fair share of bugs mostly in the ai. The most notable were my peasants choosing to drop resources at my keep instead of a cart which was right next to them, and a dragon swarmed by footmen trying to attack my dragon slayer in the back stuck and not attempting to attack anything else. My least favorite thing about the game is the fact that you have pay money in order to have additional towns with a different race. It saddens me that i can't even try out another race without paying 5 $ or deleting my first town, im fine that you can buy boosters (Its not pay to win, you are matched against players with equal army strength) but atleast let me try the other races.\n\nOverall a fun free game 8.5/10","November 2, 2014","true","22.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BewilderedTraveler/recommended/227180/","BewilderedTraveler","BewilderedTraveler","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BewilderedTraveler/","266 products in account","An excellent game overall, that will immerse most RTS players for at least a good few hours.\nIts fairly simple, with a very traditional setup of the three factions with strenghts and weaknesses. such as the Humans being the most durable overall, the Elves essentially having the strongest units but with greater weaknesses, and the Orcs being oddly enough the most frail but boasting the ability to quickly amass an army of considerable size at reduced cost.\n\n(Please note: This is more of a quick run-down of some of the features in the game, than an review. The idea is that you can more effectively decide if its features appeals to you, rather than read someone trash n praise it)\n\nLeveling up your units!:\nThis game relies quite heavily on the concept of your troops not simply being something you purchase enough of, in the right combination but actually take into skirmishes to level up or train at friendly strongholds, to then tailor suit what stats you want to improve, such as more health, damage mitigation, health regeneration, stamina, and so on.\nEventually you will pretty much max out all the stats but at that point you have spend quite a lot of gold on that unit, and considering its still very likely to get inconveniently killed while you look the other way you learn to pay special heed to keeping your investments alive and well protected.\n\nSpecial Units:\nEvery faction has an array of faction specific units available to them, but theres also a common pool of special units available to all the factions. These units have roots in all three main factions, but theres also units from unplayable races, such as Dragons and Dwarves. These units almost always costs you Crowns, which is a measure of wealth and influence that you can spend on recruiting considerably attractive units to attack your enemies or defend your homeland.\n\nQuest line:\nTheres an rather involved lore in the game, and its often very nicely attached to the characters you interact with while playing the main quest line. As you go through the main quest of your faction your tasked with defending your homeland, your kingdom, and waging war against the two other factions in the game, and often also your own.\nDue to the somewhat sandbox-like nature of the game, the senarios you find yourself in is often rather interesting and gradually gives you useful rewards that greatly benefit the construction of your homeland, giving a smooth progression of your homeland, the story of the game, and your involvement in the game overall.\n\nTraits and Regions\nIn the MMO portion of the game, after choosing a faction you will be asked to choose a region and two traits.\nThese are important and should be chosen to match how you prefer to play the game. If your a "turtle" and enjoys defensive gameplay then naturally you may want to choose the most defensive region and traits, but if your more into siege and conquest than naturally you would do well to take a region that reflects that better.\nEither way, your choice of region and traits will play an immense factor in the performance of your strategies.\nChoose wisely. :)\n\nNon-Mandatory PvP\nIn the online MMO portion of the game you may be attacked by enemies at any time, but you need to actually accept the battle. Should you choose not to, or let the timer run out you will forfeit a small portion of your resources as a tribute to be left alone. Even if no resources are available fighting PvP is never mandatory. As you start out with a new homeland you will have 24 hours of real time protection against PvP attacks to get you started.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BewilderedTraveler/recommended/227180/","BewilderedTraveler","BewilderedTraveler","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BewilderedTraveler/","266 products in account","An excellent game overall, that will immerse most RTS players for at least a good few hours.\nIts fairly simple, with a very traditional setup of the three factions with strenghts and weaknesses. such as the Humans being the most durable overall, the Elves essentially having the strongest units but with greater weaknesses, and the Orcs being oddly enough the most frail but boasting the ability to quickly amass an army of considerable size at reduced cost.\n\n(Please note: This is more of a quick run-down of some of the features in the game, than an review. The idea is that you can more effectively decide if its features appeals to you, rather than read someone trash n praise it)\n\nLeveling up your units!:\nThis game relies quite heavily on the concept of your troops not simply being something you purchase enough of, in the right combination but actually take into skirmishes to level up or train at friendly strongholds, to then tailor suit what stats you want to improve, such as more health, damage mitigation, health regeneration, stamina, and so on.\nEventually you will pretty much max out all the stats but at that point you have spend quite a lot of gold on that unit, and considering its still very likely to get inconveniently killed while you look the other way you learn to pay special heed to keeping your investments alive and well protected.\n\nSpecial Units:\nEvery faction has an array of faction specific units available to them, but theres also a common pool of special units available to all the factions. These units have roots in all three main factions, but theres also units from unplayable races, such as Dragons and Dwarves. These units almost always costs you Crowns, which is a measure of wealth and influence that you can spend on recruiting considerably attractive units to attack your enemies or defend your homeland.\n\nQuest line:\nTheres an rather involved lore in the game, and its often very nicely attached to the characters you interact with while playing the main quest line. As you go through the main quest of your faction your tasked with defending your homeland, your kingdom, and waging war against the two other factions in the game, and often also your own.\nDue to the somewhat sandbox-like nature of the game, the senarios you find yourself in is often rather interesting and gradually gives you useful rewards that greatly benefit the construction of your homeland, giving a smooth progression of your homeland, the story of the game, and your involvement in the game overall.\n\nTraits and Regions\nIn the MMO portion of the game, after choosing a faction you will be asked to choose a region and two traits.\nThese are important and should be chosen to match how you prefer to play the game. If your a "turtle" and enjoys defensive gameplay then naturally you may want to choose the most defensive region and traits, but if your more into siege and conquest than naturally you would do well to take a region that reflects that better.\nEither way, your choice of region and traits will play an immense factor in the performance of your strategies.\nChoose wisely. :)\n\nNon-Mandatory PvP\nIn the online MMO portion of the game you may be attacked by enemies at any time, but you need to actually accept the battle. Should you choose not to, or let the timer run out you will forfeit a small portion of your resources as a tribute to be left alone. Even if no resources are available fighting PvP is never mandatory. As you start out with a new homeland you will have 24 hours of real time protection against PvP attacks to get you started. Notice that this time is only ticking while your in-game. Additionally, every time you pay a tribute or conclude a PvP match you will be given a small PvP Protection time.\nIt is also possible to purchase PvP protection for Crowns.\n\nThe graphics, performance, and the gameplay itself have gradually improved over time, with updates coming out frequently enough for a game you only pay for once. (Not including the micro transaction-like boosts available in the market, and additional features)\nThe gameplay in singleplayer, whether in the online MMO world or not, is very stable but once you have an actual fight not against the AI, but another player it soon becomes a bit of a mess.(This includes co-op aswell) Reasonably playable, yes, but still very annoying at times. However, they have worked hard to improve this game and the future update expected to come out this month, which will apperantly overhaul the entire thing onto a more stable engine will hopefully bring back much of the player base and thus hopefully bring some more life back into this, in all honesty, very awesome game.\n\n(If you wish to know more details about the game, i have found a wiki with more details for you)\nhttp://strategywiki.org/wiki/Dawn_of_Fantasy\nYes, it does have some problems now and then but this game does deserve a chance if it calls out to you in general.\nRegards,\nBrandt.","April 8, 2015","true","175.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Whyle the overal controling mechanism is rather simple one may invest some energy into the micromanagement of unit stances and rotations to gain the best from the troops efforts.\n+/- The castle is limited to a few number of designs and placement spots - which are nicely done to alow the player a rather wide range of tactical options.\n+ The Armys consist of up to 60 units, including sige engines and workers to get all those shiny coins from the corpses. As the units gain experience they may be upgradet to fit the players needs.\n+ The KI citys are chalanging and differ greatly in theyr designs\n+ The pvp system seems promising, presenting some late game challange, interesting battles and army compositions and the rather easy and fair mechanics of avoiding it by paying a part of ones ressources to the attacker.\n+ The overal unit ballancing seems to be sound and while its not perfect the developers are working to improve it.\n+ The comunity is alive and quite friendly.\n\nTo play it is a little like....\nOne may upgrade his camp to a formidable stronghold. While the walls rise high the troops may march to complete the first quests and plunder some stuff on the way. By doing so one aquires the in game currency of crowns - and even if there is a rather great heap of those in the in game store, the number one may get there is limited.\nIn time the army will get experienced and gain enough power to take on the great citys of the world. The choice between looting a vanquished city or taking it on as a vassal is rather rewarding - more so if you just managed to gain a victory inside the walls of the capital :).\n\nOn the dark side ther are a few things to be said:\n\n- The KI is just not up to the task. While the unit KI is ok with only some minor *whydoyoustupidhealersengagetheogersinmeeleagain >.<* kind of problems the KI troops on the battlefield remain stationary until engaged, most of the time. Most of the movements an enemy will do are rushing his remaining troops into the keep, if you break don its gate, and some counter charges if this gate did not belong to the keep. The odd exeption is a charge of the reinforcement troop. Those apear after half an hoer into a KI sige and are pathetically easy to block, by disengaging your troops from the city and mincing the reinforcements.\n- The ballancing of the fractions is not finished yet. The orc race seems to be a little on the downside, in the overal army performance.\n- There are few end game challanges out of pvp matches. If one has put some thought into the army composition and the upgrading of ones troops there will be next to nothing left to stop this army.\n-/+ The game is still in the making. While not essentialy bad, one may get slightly annoied by a few bugs and gliitches. Also ive experienced two mayor bugs up until now, of the *dude where is my castle?* kind. On the other hand: those where solved in a matter of one or two days and the mods did theyr best to recompensate the losses. Also one may hope to see some further improvements to the gameplay and some more content to come.\n\noh, and cookies, because.... you know....\n\nIn summa summarum i recommend this game.\n\n\nHope to see you (try) torching my city some time :),\nbest regards,\nCyraion.","November 9, 2014","true","69.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

There are also a couple DLCs, but if you look at development/patch notes you realise the vanilla game is rich and you won't want to pay for the stupid DLCs even into late game (e.g. there's a SP-only dlc - for the incompetent only). Please read on.\n\n3 races to choose from. Build your city, your army, your garrison, whatever labour forces you may want. Two very important factors that I find separate this game from those you may think this is similar to (involving MMO strategy games with building a settlement):\n1) You can't be attacked when offline. If you're not logged in and playing, you can't be attacked - meaning you don't need to worry or dedicate ANY time to this game. (You also have a cancellable 24hr-game-time-only battle protection for noobs, after which you'll have a great base. Additionally, battles are always between similar-strength forces).\n2) Your buildings can't be destroyed beyond 1% health. No conflict you will ever have will reset your city. Your buildings will be repaired over time and you'll just lose a token amount of resources, from what I understand you'll even get a few crowns (useful for upgrades or renaming units etc).\n\nI recommend, if you have any interest in a forgiving MMO RTS game with visual battles and really quite rich content, you should download and try a couple of the races. Read the descriptions to see what you'd be interested in and have a go. Just be wise on how you spend your crowns in the beginning as they're earned through quests (story line), battles, daily-gift of 1 crown if you login and trading in gold.

You don't have to pay. You only pay for the game with everything in it. Nothing forces you to pay. Not sure if that feature is still in the game though.\n\nAlso I saw one review saying that you have to join the game by signing up on their website. That is not true although You have to register ingame and then receive an confirmation email for you to complete the registeration. This process do not take more than two minutes. You are required to do this in order to play the game online with friends and others. That's it.\n\nAnyway my review...\n\nOverall and ongoing, it is a fun game. I enjoy playing against AIs enemies as well as players whilst doing the storyline. I use the term, storyline, very loosely because it is almost very direct but you can do the quests whenever and in your own time. Yes, the game can and should have been better than what it is at the moment but I don't complain because it is a decent game.\n\nHowever it can be ugly due to cutscenes when you have conversations with some certain characters in the "storyline." The characters, by looking very closely, they look like they came from 90s games like Castle Strike or the old Warcraft series unless I forget to improve the graphics in the settings lol but that is manageable anyway because you don't look that closely often.\n\nOverall, I would say this is 7/10. Better than some games but could have been better.","March 16, 2014","true","32.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The developers say they aren't going for that pay to win game however the time it takes to build anything is staggering without paying.  Everything in the game costs crowns which you earn by completing quests, killing a players army, playing co-op, or defending your keep.  By no means a small amount of crowns either so basic upgrades cost 10~120 crowns each.  Note that defending your keep doesn't happen often enough to make gathering crowns in that manor a viable option.  You can purchase crowns which makes the game go quicker as you also get gold when you do this to boot.  Thus making the game actually playable if you pay.\n\nThe delevopers give out a starting bonus deal to help new players get into the game.  Compared to how slow the game moves, the bonus didn't make that much difference.  The issues is simple resource generation bonus for 10 minuts at the x10, x8, x6, and x4 level, and a 5 hour x2 resource generation.  I stopped playing before that ran out as I couldn't imagine playing the game at normal resource generation without pulling my hair out.  You also won't get attacked by anything for the first 24 hours.  To be honest I cancelled the protection as soon as I started to see if I would even get attacked at all.  I didn't at 12 hours of play get attacked once.  Which kind of makes having a walled village pointless.\n\nThe game itself has a good concept.  The graphics are okay but not great, the sounds, and music is garbage, the game play is kind of interesting.  The bugs are many.  The biggest issue is that it's a 100% server sided game.  I can log out and get more resources than I can while playing due to the lag between the server and my game.  I have an above average rig that can handle any game out on ultra settings so no it's not my computer.  If your army dies there is a glitch that doesn't reset your population count at your home base cuasing some issues trying to rebuild an army.\n\nThe main reason I don't recommend this game is becuase there is so much work involved with building an army after you get defeated, or even just play and win a battle.  Compaired to the loot you receive from a battle the cost of building an army is crazy.  An army can cost around 1,000 resources per unit with an army cap of 90 units it can get expensive.  The first major battle in the game requires around 25 units to beat.  However the losses are about 20 units.  The treasure gained is around 2,000 gold and about 400 wood and a crown or 2.  The 20 units cost around 30,000 food, and about 15,000 gold.  You don't gain land, units, or anything else in the first major battle.  It was cool to watch just not cool enough to waste 5 hours rebuilding another army to go on the next mission.\n\nThe peasant AI is horrible as well, and the gathering of resources is limited at best.  Some of the peasant resource gathering upgrades are bugged and actually don't improve what they say they will.  Which is similar to placing buildings, some locations are even bugged and you can't place anything there.  You have to choose wisely what you will place as you are limited to so many slots unless you get an upgrade to the slots of buildings you can place.  Which also requires crowns, and a lot of them.\n\nThe population cap in town might be to blame for everything wrong with the game.  With a glitch that doesn't calculate the population correctly, to not showing you all of your peasants when you click on the view all button it would seem the developers haven't finished this game yet.  The population cap is sitting at 90.  While I was able to max mine out at 50 in town after having to use population for animals to get extra food resources I found that I couldn't generate enough to build an army of 30 in a day.  It took about 5 hours to get a army of 25 going.  After that main battle which lasted about 5 minutes.  Having to rebuild all but 4 of those units there simply wasn't enough motivation to continue playing the game.\n\nIf the developer reads this I would recommend focusing on fixing any bugs the game has.  I would also lower the cost to upgrade anything with crowns in the game.  I would also rewrite the treasure you get after a battle to match the size of the battle, and the losses you will take on at an even matched battle.  If you lose you get nothing, if you win you get enough to at least repair, or rebuild most of your army.  The resource generation is so slow that it would take weeks to get anthing interesting going not to mention all the crowns I'd need just to upgrade my town hall to a castle might take months.  I would recommend changing the population cap to 100 for peasants, or fix the resource generation to make the game pace faster.  Playing 1 battle every few hours is dull and boring after all.  As the name of the game isn't kingdom building it's kingdom war. Compared to other games out there I can play that in this genra this game comes in as boring, and slow at best.  It has a ton of potential to be great, it just simply isn't at this time.","November 5, 2014","false","12.9"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

Bringing villagers to battle is actually mandatory, because looting the fallen yields amazing amounts of resources, especially from PVP.\n\nAfter any PVP (field battle or siege) you get some PVP protection time, so you're not overwhelmed from annoyingly nonstop PVP. Although, keepi in mind that the rewards from participating in PVP are quite bountiful. If you don't want to participate, a small bribe is possible, which is proportional to the army size. Smaller armies = smaller payouts. You do get PVP protection after a payout so it is possible to skip the whole PVP deal alltogether.\n\nThere is a special resource (crowns) which is necessary for all upgrades and high level units. It comes quite slowly at the beginning, but are most certainly attainable without paying real money. Ammasing gold is the way here, because crowns can be bought for gold at a rate of 1:5000. A solid economy is key, which is a must for any player of this type of game.\n\nSolid game, If you loved Stronghold, BFME, or Age of Empires you should definitely try this one.","November 4, 2014","true","68.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

A babbling brook works through my stronghold as my men patrol the walls with crossbows, blunderbusses, and bows at the ready. Bubbling oil gurgles away at the top of my gatehouses waiting to pour onto those who'd dare breach the sancitity of my realm. Trebutchets sit atop round towers waiting for the drums of war. My quiet management of my fief is piereced by the panoply of trumpets hearlding a welp who dares to raze my homeland. So I herd my peasants in and lock the gatehouses. I assemble my personal guard to the outer courtyard and lock the inner gatehouse. The enemy arrives at the edge of my walls and my trebutchets begin to sing with the whistle of flying boulders and the "swipp" of arrows leaving their strings. My men bubble out from a far gatehouse and make battle with the enemy on the fields and ruins of my homeland's outfields. They are bloodied but are victorious, the enemy driven before them.  The gates open and the peasants return to their tasks. The lutes play again and the once again peace falls over my land. It feels good to be lord.\n\n\nKingdom Wars is a PVE/PVP oriented MMORTS where you are lord of a tiny homestead on a vast and deeply detailed world of Mythador. Populated with Orcs, Elves, and Humans it reminds me deeply of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings but with a distinct Reverie Worlds spin. You can choose a race, two traits, and three different homelands that help give your kingdom a unique feel as well as mechanical benefits. You can engage in PVE quests or PVP content with additional Co-OP offerings. By far my favorite MMORTS to date and has hours upon hours of enjoyment.","November 5, 2014","true","137.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I will explain the reasons why I like and feel a recommendation to the game as well as the defects and failures in this game, let start with the failures first as most people like to read the Good n Bad in order, yeah...I don't do that.\n\n----BAD!!!\n#1: The Current Cash Shop Model allows you to literally buy your way to victory for only 10-20$ USD and is practicly forcing players to do this if they want to get their walls' up before the peace-timer ends. Not only that, the daily transaction limit on crowns should be removed, 30 Crowns a day is about 2 Upgrades of the lowest pool, not even remotely worth it.\n\n#2: Sieging requires a very large force or a very small for of units you could simply buy from the Cash Shop, Simply buying 5 Minotaurs grants you 280 Power for your army and is in no way fun to deal with as a single minotaur can kill 5 ogres by itself, let alone an entire 8 battalions of cavalry. My gripe on this is, you can also buy army power by making nothing but archers and catapults, buying fire arrows and siege munitions then stacking stone and sitting back and not doing anything as your archers have 700 range and infinite ammo.\n\n#3: Respawns are an issue when fighting other players and in missions, I play as Orcs personally because I like their resource system, it reminds me heavily of LoTRBFME, But as I could clearly see, if you buy a ton of goblins, get them all to level 20 and then max out their health regen and HP, they can literally die in combat and be instantly replenished, this obviously needs to be fixed, Goblins are in no way weak, Why buy a bunch of slayers when I could just mass so many goblins it causes the opposite player to lag out?\n\n#4: Marketplace, Oh god...This eats my RTS time soo much, Unlike "Age Of Empires" where you can setup an auto-transaction pool, you have to click the icons manually, I wish this game gave you the ability to say: "If a resource hits this  much, sell it into gold" or add a "Always keep this much on hand"; I hate having to manually click the sell resource button multiple times only to be rewarded with a deselection of the marketplace or barely any outcome.\n\n#5: The Pathing Engine, Oh lord, I broke this on the first day, apparently you can only have 3-4 Orcs harvesting a single deer, and I have about 40 Marauder Squads gathering food, problem is, there is only like 20 Marauders of the 200 collecting anything, the rest are rumbling and grumbling around like idiots, Its like watching turkey vultures trying to take turns pulling a carcass off a busy intersection, Everyone wants a stab at the corpse. This dissapoints me heavily and I believe the Pathing AI needs to be adjusted for better efficiency, because of this, I cannot bring my food income above 90.0.\n\n#6: The Resource System, Yay! not so bad now, but still underperforming. The amount of resources players are given per map, at an interval of every 3 days of respawn is stupid, If I build in a Desert, I expect far more stone than gold. And the worst part about this is the fact that the resources can only be optimally harvested by 2 harvesters each turning this into a "Starcraft 2 SCVs per Mineral Field Moment" Overrall, I either think the amount of resources per minute gathered from these needs to be increased, or increase the movement quality and gather rate of all harvesters, even with upgrades, they are still snails at this time.\n\n#7: The Upgrade System, Okay this is my final gripe, as it stands, you can literally train units to get certain skills and passives that make them sometimes, in wording of Goblin Hordes; Unkillable and other times just plain ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. How would you feel if someone's hero walked into your army and started 1-shotting all of your men and you couldn't even do more than 1 dmg to him while he regens 80/sec? Or if someone bought a set a Archers and got their movement speed, health regen, range, damage, and resistances maxed out? and just solo'd all your cavalry with arrows? Say...aren't archers supposed to be weak vs melee? It sure doesn't look like it to me. Another issue with this system, is not every unit can be upgraded, which bothers me, I cant increase the replenish rate of my Wargs, Yes I use wargs as outrunners to kill runners, and I can upgrade my laborers, even though they spawn at level 5. I would love to improve their movement speed. I realize this game is not done yet, but seriously?\n\n------GOOD STUFF!!!------\n\n#1: Performance = The game performs very well on my crappy computer, I have everything that is below the minimal requirements listed for downloading the game, my Graphics card is even out of date by 8 years. I'm suprised I can run the game at 60-113fps in terrain that would normally eat my computer, however there is one terrain that drops me below 30fps, and that is the swamps, that terrain is either high on particles or overrun with reflections. The graphics options are lack luster and need to be evaluated, but if this game turns into another 64x system required game, I swear I'm going to break a kneecap.\n\n#2: Animation Quality = I love the chopping down of trees and the maiming of overly maimed corpses, the arrow firing and ring-rung animations of swordsman swinging their swords in 4 different ways at least gives heart to this addition, I hate games like "Rome Total War" where there is literally 1-2 Animations for everything except pre-scripted cinema gestures. The only thing I noticed is the level attack animation, it looks like there is no attack speed pool between attacks as soon as the target engages within melee range. This might need a look into.\n\n#3: Map Movement Speed = I like this system, however I have seen it in many other F2P and B2P titles and some of which are much faster, this system prevents sieges from occuring too-often which is nice as players have to constantly run back and forth from their major city to replenish supplies and then run back, the only problem I see is when you are doing campaign or single player effects like quests, I think your movement speed should be increased for these and only these, especially if all your going to have to do is talk to some old fart.\n\n#4: Unit Composition = I love that you have brought back the obvious, Archer vs Swordsman vs Cavalry vs Pikeman vs Siege effect, but there is alot of balance to be had and as it is clearly obvious, Archers are the best. I also want my Trolls, what Orc army doesn't have a giant Cave Troll? Ogres are not as good as Trolls. I think if you were to add a Troll which you should, it should replace the useless Meat-Grinder and cost crowns to make.\n\n#5: Heros = Many games don't have a natural hero system, as it is very hard to balance, "IT IS" but either way, kudos to the Devs for adding it, however I would rather be given a choice on what type of hero I am interested in, it gripes me that  every Hero I've gotten so far has been melee, I would atleast like a "Switch Weapon" effect or be able to choose if my hero was a Mage, Archer, or Warrior, this would give the game more variation and would make buying Vanity for the individuals more effective as you would have more to choose from instead of 3 pathetic pieces of army that look the same.\n\n----FINISHED----\n\nWhy I write reviews?\n-I write reviews to give developers and players a heads up and truthful perspective of what effects are taking place in the game in order to prevent the wrong crowd from joining a game they don't expect. I am a Balancer and Play-Tester of other games and have a huge tendancy to find bugs, or bugs find me and break the game entirely, or find things that are uncanny and imbalanced. I don't do these reviews for money or excerpts, I only post them as notifications, I have no interest is retaining any order within said game. Things need to be fixed, I post what and how in the review of the current stage. Simple constructive criticism.","November 8, 2014","true","23.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Menof36go/recommended/227180/","Menof36go","Selbstmord","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Menof36go/","64 products in account","I want to start with the good things about Kingdom Wars first. If youre interested you can read this guide or just try out the game, but if you have a bad internet connection, you should probably read first to know more about the game itself.\n\nThe game itself is awesome. Its like freaking stronghold, but online.\nDid you ever play Age of Empires? Well, if you did you probably know the economy system is awesome. Did you ever play American Conquest or Cossacks? Well, if you did you probably know the combat system is awesome. This game is a mix of those games, but massive mutliplayer. Its a so called MMORTS (Massive Multiplayer Online Real Time Strategy).\n\nThe best thing about this game is the fact that there's no pay2win.\nYou can pretty much archive everything ingame and there's no advantage for players paying money for things like premium or customisation.\n\nDid you ever get bored because you would have to pay with real money to boost up building sth or training troops? Well, you wont get bored in this game, because building stuff doesnt take very long and the devs gave us nice quests to do. If you want to get ressources to get a bigger army you can make quests, loot enemies or siege a town. Trust me, I never got bored in this game and I think you wont too.\n\nA very interesting idea is the quest system. There's some sort of story depending on the world region you are living in. For example you have fight, protect, destroy or survive during such quests. Its important to know as much as possible about the enemy to have an advantage. Every unit has a few different formations which are effective against a special type of enemy. If you siege a castle, you want to put your archers to skirmish formation so you gain a speed boost and protection against enemy ranged units. The formations vary from unit to unit and are special for each kingdoms.\nThere are a bunch of upgrades you can get for ressources to get better formations like the skirmish formation I mentioned above. Since the units vary from race to race (Orc, Elves, Human), its important to know your strenghts. You have to act different each time depending the enemy you conquer. That makes the game pretty exciting if you ask me.\n\nIve mentioned the races above and want to explain them to you. Basically there are 3 races with different units and strenghts. The orcs are very strong melee fighters. Their units are dealing heavy damage, but they have weak ranged units. Their strongholds are wood based and they use catapults as siege weapons. Its a pretty brutal race, you should try it if you dont know which race you should choose! The humans are pretty much balanced. They have medium melee fighters, medium ranged units and good cavalry. Their stronghold are wood (Palisades) and stone based (After further upgrades). They have very strong formations if you ask me. Theyve knights and mounted knights which are pretty much the strongest allrounders ingame. The elves are a race with a "fantasy" lore. Their ranged units are very powerful and able to kill even heavy units easily on distance. The strongholds look cool, but I dont like the "fantasy" style, but its pretty much the only thing I dont like about them. Their units are interesting and the lore is great, but many players dont like elves for some reason.\n\nSome units can use special abilities, for example the human knight. He can heal nearby troops.\nIf you got too many crowns (from battles, quests etc.) you can spend 'em on dwarves.\nDwarves have a bunch of nice units you can buy! For example you can buy a troop of miners, which are mining way faster than the normal peasents. Their siege engine is great too. They got a highrange cannon which can destroy walls like a catapult. Its pretty expensive though.\nIf youre more a fan of ranged units you will probably love the riflemen! They are not so expensive and are useful if you want to defend you village. The only disadvantages of dwarven troops are that they are expensive and slow.\n\nThere's also a pretty nice chat system! Its split into a few channels, but the most interesting channel is probably the channel called "Help". Its pretty much a support channel, so if you got any problems or want to report a player, you can easily write in the support channel.\n\nBut sadly, there are also bad things about this game.\nThe game has many bugs, that means you will probably experience some problems.\nSince the devs are fixing many bugs and working on it thats not a very heavy problem.\nThe biggest problem is probably the awful AI. Trust me.. Ranged units run and chase the enemy, siege engines shot themselves if they get charged and some troops just dont want to attack the enemy - no matter what. I think the devs should probably improve the AI. Its no gameplay ruining, but its bad, making you angry and unprofessional.\n\nTo conclude you can say the game is a pretty interesting one with almost no problems. You can play it without having to pay, you can have much fun, but you will sometimes experience some bugs.\n\nIf you wrote so far youre probably mad since my grammar is terrible, but thanks for reading.","November 3, 2014","true","87.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

A great new step in the genre, love to see things evolve in a different light.","January 24, 2015","true","24.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Menof36go/recommended/227180/","Menof36go","Selbstmord","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Menof36go/","64 products in account","I want to start with the good things about Kingdom Wars first. If youre interested you can read this guide or just try out the game, but if you have a bad internet connection, you should probably read first to know more about the game itself.\n\nThe game itself is awesome. Its like freaking stronghold, but online.\nDid you ever play Age of Empires? Well, if you did you probably know the economy system is awesome. Did you ever play American Conquest or Cossacks? Well, if you did you probably know the combat system is awesome. This game is a mix of those games, but massive mutliplayer. Its a so called MMORTS (Massive Multiplayer Online Real Time Strategy).\n\nThe best thing about this game is the fact that there's no pay2win.\nYou can pretty much archive everything ingame and there's no advantage for players paying money for things like premium or customisation.\n\nDid you ever get bored because you would have to pay with real money to boost up building sth or training troops? Well, you wont get bored in this game, because building stuff doesnt take very long and the devs gave us nice quests to do. If you want to get ressources to get a bigger army you can make quests, loot enemies or siege a town. Trust me, I never got bored in this game and I think you wont too.\n\nA very interesting idea is the quest system. There's some sort of story depending on the world region you are living in. For example you have fight, protect, destroy or survive during such quests. Its important to know as much as possible about the enemy to have an advantage. Every unit has a few different formations which are effective against a special type of enemy. If you siege a castle, you want to put your archers to skirmish formation so you gain a speed boost and protection against enemy ranged units. The formations vary from unit to unit and are special for each kingdoms.\nThere are a bunch of upgrades you can get for ressources to get better formations like the skirmish formation I mentioned above. Since the units vary from race to race (Orc, Elves, Human), its important to know your strenghts. You have to act different each time depending the enemy you conquer. That makes the game pretty exciting if you ask me.\n\nIve mentioned the races above and want to explain them to you. Basically there are 3 races with different units and strenghts. The orcs are very strong melee fighters. Their units are dealing heavy damage, but they have weak ranged units. Their strongholds are wood based and they use catapults as siege weapons. Its a pretty brutal race, you should try it if you dont know which race you should choose! The humans are pretty much balanced. They have medium melee fighters, medium ranged units and good cavalry. Their stronghold are wood (Palisades) and stone based (After further upgrades). They have very strong formations if you ask me. Theyve knights and mounted knights which are pretty much the strongest allrounders ingame. The elves are a race with a "fantasy" lore. Their ranged units are very powerful and able to kill even heavy units easily on distance. The strongholds look cool, but I dont like the "fantasy" style, but its pretty much the only thing I dont like about them. Their units are interesting and the lore is great, but many players dont like elves for some reason.\n\nSome units can use special abilities, for example the human knight. He can heal nearby troops.\nIf you got too many crowns (from battles, quests etc.) you can spend 'em on dwarves.\nDwarves have a bunch of nice units you can buy! For example you can buy a troop of miners, which are mining way faster than the normal peasents. Their siege engine is great too. They got a highrange cannon which can destroy walls like a catapult. Its pretty expensive though.\nIf youre more a fan of ranged units you will probably love the riflemen! They are not so expensive and are useful if you want to defend you village. The only disadvantages of dwarven troops are that they are expensive and slow.\n\nThere's also a pretty nice chat system! Its split into a few channels, but the most interesting channel is probably the channel called "Help". Its pretty much a support channel, so if you got any problems or want to report a player, you can easily write in the support channel.\n\nBut sadly, there are also bad things about this game.\nThe game has many bugs, that means you will probably experience some problems.\nSince the devs are fixing many bugs and working on it thats not a very heavy problem.\nThe biggest problem is probably the awful AI. Trust me.. Ranged units run and chase the enemy, siege engines shot themselves if they get charged and some troops just dont want to attack the enemy - no matter what. I think the devs should probably improve the AI. Its no gameplay ruining, but its bad, making you angry and unprofessional.\n\nTo conclude you can say the game is a pretty interesting one with almost no problems. You can play it without having to pay, you can have much fun, but you will sometimes experience some bugs.\n\nIf you wrote so far youre probably mad since my grammar is terrible, but thanks for reading.","November 3, 2014","true","87.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

One of this game that are easy to play and hard to master. Imagine old classic Stronghold... online... and with DRAGONS!

Think then act, no more moronic rushing and farming. Neat backstory, not the boring one with good and evil but about feudal struggles on thy fantasy continent. Very big amount of units, buildings and upgrades makes another deep strategy element, there is no single way to become mighty lord of a enormous stronghold! There are only few absurd situations that can happen like losing few hundred men army by one oil pot because they stacked on a wrong place in a wrong time but there is nothing that you can't avoid with changing your way of play so it's ok.

First, the most polemical part of a free to play game: pay to win walls. This game is a true free to play strategy game, no pay to win walls, I got everything that can be got using crowns without spending a single dime. But that is the interesting part, the game is so good that I want to spend money on it. If not by the steam's overlay problem, I would gladly by some esthetic skins or even boosters packs.\n\nKingdom Wars is not a game uniquely focused to multiplayer gameplay. You can play the singleplayer and by your own explore the world map the game's lore. Know that thing EA will not put in the new Stars Wars game? Kingdom War have it, and an immensely good one. And you have a lot of time to play without any multiplayer concern the singleplayer aspect of the game, because the battle protection only counts out when you’re logged in the game, so if you play two hours a day you have twelve days to enjoy the singleplayer and more important, prepare yourself for when the battle protection time expires.\n\nNevertheless, if you want you can play the singleplayer campaign in coop with a friend you will lose this protection, and will need to be concern with multiplayer aspects, because co-op is only possible if you both cancel the battle protection. If you just want to enjoy with a friend the lore and world map you cannot do it undisturbedly, because if you cancel the battle protection you will open the game’s multiplayer section.\n\nContinuing, the have a large world map, if many cities to explore. Different races to interact with, and tons of others things. Definitely worth. You want to make diplomacy with the NPC cities close to you? You can. Want to conquer then all? Also can. Travel half world have interact you dwarfs and their cities, ruins and mines? Also in the game. And better, you can play as three different civilizations, humans, elves and orcs. And each one plays different and feels different Kingdom Wars is easily on of my favorite strategy games currently, the only thing that keeps this game to enter my favorite strategy games of all time is that you cannot play with a dwarven civilization. Moreover, the developers’ team is great, one of the best on steam; they are constructing a path that only makes me likes this game even more, with new huge patches and free expansions (please would you consider adding the option to play as dwarves?). At least you can have dwarven units in your army, and I loved it. Inasmuch as is not from an AAA company Kingdom Wars nails every except one aspect that a game of this genre needs. Will address this one major problem next paragraph.\n\nThere is but one thing that bugs me. The troop’s management. When you will position your troops you only see and blue arrow that indicates the direction, and gets larger or thinner. It is a hideous system, seriously.  Honestly and fairly tip: uses Total War’s system (do not need to explain how it is, everyone knows). In the new announcement concerning the new free expansion (learn from KW’s devs CA) and patches, they said they will implement the KW 2 battle system to this game, but I yet did not played KW 2 Battles, so I do not knows how it is. Maybe will fix this that is my major problem with the game, but that is yet to be seen.\n\nBesides this last critic, I love the game. Will play for more forty hours. Easily deserves a 6/10. Considering the new announcements, I am almost sure Kingdom Wars can advance to an 7/10.","October 11, 2015","true","57.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It really doesn't pay to be logged in for the sake of it.  Also you don't become punished for your success as you don't have more than one city on a server to look after and build up.  The game is perfectly playable without paying, but if you do pay the game is not particuarly unbalanced for it.  There are loads of options to invest in research, whether for better catapaults, or better yield from your farms.  You will probably want more than one standing army, each tailored for various tasks and so you will need to generate gold to train the troops, though they will slowly train by winning battles.  It is more likely you will pay for their training as it is by far the quicker and economical option.\n\nYou will probably also need help fulfilling the battles that unfold as your story progresses which apart from chat is your only avenue of co-operative play with others.   You can make friends and ask them along which, if they have an army of similar strength, they have the option to do.   Added to this, attacking others happens on a random basis so far as army matches go. If you like, you can scour the area and maek battle with innate cities/armies.\n\nPeople will attack you, and if you don't have the time, or don't want to take losses you can pay them off instead, rather than fight.  So I find when I need to off load goods that my industry is generating and recruit or train more troops, I log in every few hours.   If I want to battle I log in with expectation of taking maybe an hour - some sieges demand an element of patience - and If I just want to sort out my armies, again Iog in for a while as necessary.\n\nSo although many of the sieges are similar, they are not tedious, and since some players have been at this game for a year  or two, it is sustainable and so far as things go, I think I might be found here in this land in a few years time too.","October 10, 2015","true","103.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

First, the most polemical part of a free to play game: pay to win walls. This game is a true free to play strategy game, no pay to win walls, I got everything that can be got using crowns without spending a single dime. But that is the interesting part, the game is so good that I want to spend money on it. If not by the steam's overlay problem, I would gladly by some esthetic skins or even boosters packs.\n\nKingdom Wars is not a game uniquely focused to multiplayer gameplay. You can play the singleplayer and by your own explore the world map the game's lore. Know that thing EA will not put in the new Stars Wars game? Kingdom War have it, and an immensely good one. And you have a lot of time to play without any multiplayer concern the singleplayer aspect of the game, because the battle protection only counts out when you’re logged in the game, so if you play two hours a day you have twelve days to enjoy the singleplayer and more important, prepare yourself for when the battle protection time expires.\n\nNevertheless, if you want you can play the singleplayer campaign in coop with a friend you will lose this protection, and will need to be concern with multiplayer aspects, because co-op is only possible if you both cancel the battle protection. If you just want to enjoy with a friend the lore and world map you cannot do it undisturbedly, because if you cancel the battle protection you will open the game’s multiplayer section.\n\nContinuing, the have a large world map, if many cities to explore. Different races to interact with, and tons of others things. Definitely worth. You want to make diplomacy with the NPC cities close to you? You can. Want to conquer then all? Also can. Travel half world have interact you dwarfs and their cities, ruins and mines? Also in the game. And better, you can play as three different civilizations, humans, elves and orcs. And each one plays different and feels different Kingdom Wars is easily on of my favorite strategy games currently, the only thing that keeps this game to enter my favorite strategy games of all time is that you cannot play with a dwarven civilization. Moreover, the developers’ team is great, one of the best on steam; they are constructing a path that only makes me likes this game even more, with new huge patches and free expansions (please would you consider adding the option to play as dwarves?). At least you can have dwarven units in your army, and I loved it. Inasmuch as is not from an AAA company Kingdom Wars nails every except one aspect that a game of this genre needs. Will address this one major problem next paragraph.\n\nThere is but one thing that bugs me. The troop’s management. When you will position your troops you only see and blue arrow that indicates the direction, and gets larger or thinner. It is a hideous system, seriously.  Honestly and fairly tip: uses Total War’s system (do not need to explain how it is, everyone knows). In the new announcement concerning the new free expansion (learn from KW’s devs CA) and patches, they said they will implement the KW 2 battle system to this game, but I yet did not played KW 2 Battles, so I do not knows how it is. Maybe will fix this that is my major problem with the game, but that is yet to be seen.\n\nBesides this last critic, I love the game. Will play for more forty hours. Easily deserves a 6/10. Considering the new announcements, I am almost sure Kingdom Wars can advance to an 7/10.","October 11, 2015","true","57.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Yeah, this game in term of sieges have very much to offer, not every single one siege would be exactly the same and there is always more than one or two ways to achieve vitory. Think then act, no more moronic rushing and farming. Neat backstory, not the boring one with good and evil but about feudal struggles on thy fantasy continent. Very big amount of units, buildings and upgrades makes another deep strategy element, there is no single way to become mighty lord of a enormous stronghold! There are only few absurd situations that can happen like losing few hundred men army by one oil pot because they stacked on a wrong place in a wrong time but there is nothing that you can't avoid with changing your way of play so it's ok.

Like when a horde of idk golbins come an you send some of your men to fight them it ends up looking like i hocked a bloody lugy on my pc screen.. An all that time i spent trying to tatically set my troops in formation starts to fill pointless cause there all going to end up packed into one which can leave room for an easy flank.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/officialevilpanda/recommended/227180/","officialevilpanda","Evil Panda","http://steamcommunity.com/id/officialevilpanda/","320 products in account","This game kind of sucks, it has so much potential but it just falls short. The gameplay/combat resembles the lord of the rings strategy game but with a million years more waiting and "crowns" which you slowly generate through battles or you can just go pay to win and purchase them with real money, the coop is kind of pathetic with only certain missions being able to be cooped and you have to have similar armies and be in same region so if you want to be different races you will have to do lots of walking and waiting to coop, you cant see other players only your own city so the whole world map seemed pointless to me. The game is pretty laggy in pvp and coop, i know the company has been trying hard to reduce it but i bought this game back when it was first released as dawn of fantasy a few years ago and it has yet to be improved. This game doesnt have to many hackers but there are a few who ive had the displeasure of battling. This game is very slow if they got rid of the crowns it would be better but i guess they have to earn money since this game failed when it wasnt free to play. Graphics are pretty good in this game but there are a few bugs such as walls not touching ends of cliffs properly so when people attack you they can just walk between the gap rather than haveing to actually attack the walls or gate and units sometimes have issues staying in groups when you put them on the walls or towers not to mention they sometimes dont shoot inside of the base from the outside walls when units swarm in. Overall this game does lack quite alot but if you want to win pvp just buy a whole lot of crown units they will overpower the average units in any battle even if you are completely outnumber crown units will be able to get you an easy win, they definatly do need nerfed but as long as people keep spending real money to get them im sure they will stick around for a while. definatly do not play this if you are looking for a good coop game, this sucks and should just be considered a mmo at best. Game had so much potential am kind of disappointed but am looking forward to the new game they are making and hopefully they will fix all the issues with that one which they never did in this game.","July 3, 2015","false","48.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Kingdom Wars could be a great game, BUT, The devs refuse to part with wizards that can wipe out whope amies with one spell. Until the devs get rid of the wizards OR make the wizards only able to cover a very small area instead of 1/4 of the screen with their spells. this is NOT a fun game to play.  Wizards were always more of a healer than a battle unit, and even as a battle unit they are only able to attack one unit at a time, NOT half a battle field. No Wizard, even Morgana or Merlin ever had that much accumulated manna stored up to cast that kind of magic and had to reserve their mana and use it in small amounts as if you deplete your mana, you have a good chance of dying, unable to defend yourself from other on the battle field or even from disease. The wizards in this game do not even have to use their mana to keep a field around themselve to stop or deflect damage, but instead are just higher in kill points and life points as you level them up. I founf NO limit to how high you can level a wizard up. UNTIL they get rid of or change wizards to conform within reality like the other troops in this game I will recommend that no one purchase this game.","July 19, 2015","false","073.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

The main reason for this is the number of game-recking bugs i have experienced myself and are well known to the people i have spoken with in chat. Bugs such as: losing control of units (cannot issue move or attack commands), path finder mishaps resulting in units becoming stuck (I have even had armies on the world map become stranded and have had to delete them) as well as the utter b*ll-sh*t of moving the camera away for literally 3 seconds and returning to find half my men dead of no apparent cause and finally, on occasion, your max leveled, max perked units (lets say, cavalry) will somehow be killed by enemy units half their number and half their level, which are weak to your units (e.g. archers).\n\nIf you have the patience of a saint, then get this game as it is enjoyable when it works. But there is nothing more annoying than being an inch away from victory and losing control of your men and having to watch them be massacred by enemies the equivalent to an orphan with polio who takes all the steroids in the world as soon as they touch you.","September 27, 2015","false","126.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Start working! Get the game shaped!\n\nI would enjoy it the same way as I did the first (monthly progress) time, although the goofy combat, and delayed movement of units fustrates me, I will still play it. If that major annoyance would be fixed/improved/ or get better solutions, I would pay again (but don't get cheesy). But PLEASE. F****** don't leave the game die as many good ones did! It's a waste of art. Obviously I won't even talk about many features it can have, such as more races,more tech, management, more opportunities, etc....Just do this one splat of lazy movement and sluggish and unresponsive combat. Improve it.( You might say: "you can get used to it, it's not that bad"...but then why does it have to be bad? when it can be improved. <<Lazy mentallity I say!>>)\n\nThis is where you want to stop? or end your limits?. As many other obstacles may be (which of course I'm not aware of, financially or whatever) just don't give up. Is it just me this game is still feeling unfinished?

For most computers you are going to be playing on low and still experience mind numbing lag from the tiniest seige battles at the beggining of the game. Resource gathering has nothing to it, nor do things like skill. Tech tree is tiny, you will have built everything by hour three and thus has every unit for your faction.\n\nThen lets go to the combat. Every unit you create at home has a level up system, which much be activated manually for each of the 30-40 units you feild. Thats right, before every battle you have to individually level up every single unit. I was playing orcs, and this got boring by the time I had a screen full of goblins.\n\nKingdom wars is not a good game, and Reverie is under the impression if they keep adding tiny packs of content to the game it's suddenly going to fix every problem in their games code; or better yet suddenly turn their game into a strategy title. You won't experience multiplayer, nobody plays.","January 21, 2014","false","17.0"," 21 of 44 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","21","44","0","0"

Poor unit support, poor unit placement support, poor unit feedback support the game is just so shtty overall. I dont mind paying a buck or two or even $10 for a game that actually works MOST of the time rather than half the time. This game isn't really "free" and they say it isn't pay to win but that isn't really the case. This game in fact is CLEARLY A PAY 2 WIN because you can buy the ingame currency(crowns) for cash and enhance your army/city way faster than a freebie player would. Honestly don't play this game, this is coming from an avid RTS gamer and sadly there aren't many great free RTS games here on steam. Full of bugs too, it's really annoying.
