It seems that some recent version of Nvidia drivers broke some graphic effects in late-game cutscenes. Unfortunately, the rights to this game are a royal cluster of bureaucracy between Disney, CAPCOM, and WayForward, and nobody seems interested in addressing the issue, or even acknowledging that this game exists anymore. Basically, if you don’t have access to a PC without an Nvidia card, do not buy this game, as you will not be able to finish it without skipping specific cutscenes and using weird workarounds.\n\nAside from that unforgivable issue, the game is okay. It is a decent remix of the original DuckTales NES game, and is sure to bring waves of nostalgia to anyone who has fond memories of it. For the unfamiliar, DuckTales is a barebones, unremarkable platformer where the main gimmick is that you can bounce around on a pogo stick which can break bricks, defeat enemies, and cross dangerous terrain – think of Shovel Knight’s down-stab attack, but one that works nearly anywhere and not just on top of enemies.\n\nBut the game is certainly is a “remix” and very much not the same game as it used to be. Imagine the differences between Super Mario Bros. 3 and New Super Mario Bros, and you'll get a decent idea of how this game has been updated. Differences include:\n\n- Save points! Unlike the NES game, you can save your game between levels and come back later (unless you’re an achievement hunter playing Extreme difficulty, in which case you’ll have to beat the whole game in one sitting anyway… sorry!).\n- Greatly improved controls which make it much easier to master the pogo stick.\n- Large changes in level design which make them easier, but the addition of more fetch quests make them longer.\n- Bosses are harder and longer with the addition of long unskippable invulnerability periods.\n- Some plot events have been removed, such as the Transylvania detour in the mines level, and the paywall in the Amazon level.\n- Money collected in-game is more than just score, and can be spent on gallery unlocks.\n\nThe new sprite animations are absolutely adorable, and the soundtrack by Jake Kaufman (composer for Shovel Knight and the Shantae series) is just epic – the soundtrack alone is, in my opinion, worth more than the price of the game.  But it seems that this game’s main draw is its storytelling and voice acting – several of the voice actors from the DuckTales TV show have returned to voice the characters, and the levels play out like an episode of the show with numerous cutscenes. This is where the game somewhat fell flat to me. Although the scripted cutscenes obviously had a lot of heart put into them, I found them mostly annoying, pointless, and not nearly as funny or clever as the show they try so hard to pay tribute to. After seeing each cutscene once, I saw no reason not to just slam on the “skip cinematic” button on all subsequent playthroughs, and that makes me a bit sad, because I feel like that’s where most of the charm of this remake is supposed to be coming from.\n\nFinal verdict: don’t buy, because we PC gamers need to put pressure and accountability on the corporate red tape which prevents developers from supporting the games they make. Talk with your wallet, as they say, because that’s the only way they’ll listen. Leaving a reproducible crash bug that prevents the game from being completed, especially near the end of the game when refunds aren’t available anymore, is simply unacceptable for everyone involved.\n\nBut if you want to ignore me and buy the game anyway, keep in mind that this is a game meant to be played with nostalgia goggles firmly glued to your face. If you’re a huge fan of the original NES game, then you’ll probably love this from beginning to end. But if you’ve never played DuckTales before, you might find the level design to be a bit empty, tedious, and pointless – you’d probably get more overall joy out of Shovel Knight. It’s not a terrible game by any means, but if you're a newcomer to the game then it probably won't blow you away.","November 2, 2015","false","10.6"," 255 of 297 people (86%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","86","255","297","5","11"

Back then games were short and sweet, incredibly focused affairs and often brutally difficult. There were no check point systems and most titles released during this era did not even have a save feature which only ended up encouraging gamers to clear the game in one single sitting. DuckTales was also one of the very few licensed titles for the time done right. Often, as is today, games released off licensed material tended to be terrible cash grab affairs but back in 1989 DuckTales seemed to buck that trend offering something genuinely delightful to fans of the ever popular Disney television show.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=352783789\nWith the current resurgence of 8-bit nostalgia being embraced by many an indie developer it was great news for fans of the original to hear Capcom had commissioned a remastering similar to that of its Bionic Commando remaster. With development reigns handed over to Wayforward (Grin studios worked on the Bionic Commando: Rearmed remaster) they set about recreating the DuckTales universe with newly hand-drawn animated sprites, employing authentic Disney character voices and evolving the original game levels with stunning hand-painted backgrounds. The result is simply stunning. While much is left in tact, quite a bit has of course changed with new areas added to the various levels encountered in the original and boss battle patterns altered for a new generation of gamers. The chiptune soundtrack, one of the all time 8-bit best, has also been modernized and should have most comfortably humming away at each levels tune as if no time had passed whatsoever.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=353057554\nDucktales Remastered does remain steadfastly old-school though. While certainly not up to the levels of difficulty of the original thanks to a newly implemented save feature that saves your progress once each area has been completed, it's still no walk in the park and even playing the game on normal mode (there is also a hard and challenging mode for you masochists out there) many gamers playing this title for the first time should be offered a suitably difficult challenge. DuckTales Remastered also shows off the era's love for its themed levels, which were repeated ad naseum during the NES's reign. You will get a Forrest level, and Ice level, a Haunted Castle/House level and an Underground level just like almost all the level design represented back in gaming then. Depending on your nostalgia factor this may or may not impress you seeing as though most modern platformers (Rayman Origin/Legends, Super Mario Bro.) have tried hard to distance themselves from such level design implementations and if they have included them, attempted to add  twists to freshen them up.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=352644178\nGameplay is still very much the same as the original with Scrooge McDuck dealing blows to the enemies in his path with his pogo stick which he can bounce on to elevate him above his enemies heads. Landing directly on the head of an enemy will safely vanquishe them, miss and connect with them directly will result in a heart being shaved off Scrooge's health. Scrooge McDuck starts his with adventures with three hearts but as you progress you do earn more heart health vials that certainly come in handy when battling it out with the level end bosses.\n\nDuckTales Remasterd is a wonderful trip down memory lane and while gaming may have moved along in leaps and bounds it speaks wonders of the original's power that even though DuckTales Remasterd is a simple little adventure, a love letter to all its fans, that by no means does not make it an engrossing game to re-experience or experience for the very first time. DuckTales Remastered is the perfect lazy Sunday afternoon fodder for all you NES fanatics and newcomers out there.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","December 8, 2014","true","13.7"," 134 of 151 people (89%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","89","134","151","12","17"

I played on a controller and the controls were tight and responsive, easy to use and very fun. The game was bright, colourful and looks beautiful, they've done a great job remastering the scenes and levels. The gameplay is very classic and enjoyable, and the story whimsical and fun.\n\nNext, and just for a moment, I'll talk about the voice actors. One of the big draws of the game is that the original audio has been remastered by re-recording using the original cast of the original DuckTales game. This, at times, is pretty cool! But, after a while, I felt that the voice of Scrooge McDuck to just be a little "too old". Like, I know that sounds mean, but some of the lines seemed very strained and some incomprehensible without subtitles. While awesome to have the original voice actor back, I feel this drained a little of the vibrant colour from the game, for me.\n\nAnd now, I'll discuss the difficulty of the game. My god this game is hard. Of the 7 hours I played, at least 3-4 were spent on the last level. The game uses a Lives system which, if you run out of, it's game over. Start again. Not the game, but the level.\n\nThe final level of the game takes about 20+ minutes to complete. If you run out of lives, on the final bossfight, you have to re-do the entire level again. I have never been so frustrated by something that I felt, while playing, should be so easy. Many controller slams were had. But, in a good way. In an I WILL COMPLETE THIS I SWEAR TO GOD way, which so many games wish they could achieve in this day and age. If you're up to a challenge, this is the game for you. Trust me.\n\nOh, did I mention I completed it on Normal mode? Yeah. There's a Hard Mode too. I couldn't even imagine completing Hard Mode.\n\nOh, and after Hard Mode, there's Extreme Mode.\n\nHighly recommended for gamers who like a challenge.\n\nNilesy","June 17, 2014","true","7.1"," 91 of 95 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","91","95","0","0"

The pixel sprites are replaced with hand-drawn, fully animated images and the music, which is also notoriously good in the original, has been updated as well and sounds fantastic! As a bonus, the original music can be used as well from the options screen. Also in the audio department, most of the original voice acting cast returns to lend their vocals.\n\nThe game is let down by frequent and dull cutscenes, they can be skipped but you need to pause the game and select "skip cutscene" which gets old fast. Another let-down is the that it seems to give a lot more health and continues than I remember, making it a little too easy unless you use the hardest possible difficulty which can only be unlocked after an initial full playthrough. Regardless, highly recommended if you are into platformers and especially so if you owned the original, WayForward does a great job and you can see a lot of love went into making it happen.","September 13, 2013","true","12.5"," 117 of 135 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","117","135","0","0"

It's a beautiful game and WayForward and Disney have given it a lot of love. I could write many more paragraphs about how well-crafted the and game is than this review takes.\n\nHowever I can't recommend it. The game has a catastrophic bug that causes the game to freeze on a significant number of users' machines, including my best PC. It appears to be a problem that is occurring with an increasing portion of new players and one suggested option to reduce (unfortunately not eliminate) the problem is to lower the graphics settings, resolution etc. so it seems likely the issue happens most when the game is played at its best. It is more frustrating still that this freeze happens mostly at the very end of the game.\n\nBut the most annoying thing about this is that Capcom are being wilfully neglectful of all of these complaints. Players have repeatedly contacted them about the problem over the last 2 1/2 years. WayForward, the licensed developers, have also tried to communicate with them to offer work on fixing the issue. But all of this is being rejected, so nothing can be done. It turns one of the best games and certainly one of the best platformers of recent years into one of the most aggrivating.\n\nInstead I would recommend looking into other WayForward-developed platformers where they are not restricted in such a way, and where such issues cannot be found. In particular the upcoming Shantae: Half Genie Hero is shaping up to be a wonderful game with similar aesthetics and handling.","January 11","false","18.2"," 71 of 83 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","71","83","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fredriknd/recommended/237630/","fredriknd","Fnord","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fredriknd/","2594 products in account","I'm not giving this game a negative review because it's a terrible game. I'm giving it a negative review due to a commonly occurring bug that makes the game impossible to beat.\nDuckTales: Remastered is a remake (rather than a remaster) of an old NES game that garnered quite a bit of praise back in the days, for its well crafted levels, great soundtrack and fun gameplay. Remastered does not quite hit all the same notes, but the core gameplay is still very fun.\n\nGraphics and sound\nIf anything, the game actually looks better than the show it's based on. The colours are vibrant, movement is smooth and everything is nicely detailed without feeling cluttered. It "feels" like a cartoon, in a good way. The only area where criticism can really be had is in the animations that sometimes leave a bit to desire. Still, the game is beautiful.\nAnd it's no slouch in the sound department either. All the songs but one are based on the soundtrack of the NES game, but updated to make use of modern hardware. Only a single song is less than stellar, and that's the one that is new to this game. And it's not even a bad song, it just does not fit in with the rest.\nAnd what good is an action game without good sound effects? It "feels" satisfying to jump on enemies. The sound effects have just the right amount of "impact", creating a very satisfying experience. It manages to both stay faithful to its source material (the NES game), and expand on it.\nAnd let's not forget the voice acting. It's great. I did not grow up with the English version of the cartoon, and I still think the voice acting sound just right. This is extra impressive, considering the age of many of the voice actors (remember, this show originally aired back in 1987).\n\nStory\nNo-one will play this game for its story. It's a forgettable story that adds very little to the overall experience. You're out looking for some special treasures, and need to visit places all over the world, and also the moon, in order to find them. That's really the extent of it.\nSadly, the story delivery often gets in the way of the gameplay. Cutscenes are frequent, and they completely stop the action. It would most likely have been better to just have one bigger cutscene at the start of the level, and then a bigger one at the end, with some chatter between the characters during the levels that don't require you to stop moving.\n\nGameplay\nThe game borrows its gameplay from the original NES game, and it's a testament to good design when in 2015 a game that plays like a game from 1989 still is a joy to play. Bouncing on enemies is just as fun now as it was back then.\nThe levels are heavily inspired by the levels from the NES game, keeping a similar layout. New objectives are added to the levels that basically amount to scavenger hunts, and here is where the game starts showing its faults. The original levels were never designed to be navigated this way, you were supposed to get to certain points in them, and you had a few options in regards to how you got to these points. In the remaster you need to go through almost every part of the level, which results in some strange looping back. It's particularly bad in the first non-tutorial level that you're likely to play, Amazonas, where you were originally meant to either pick the upper or lower rout in the earlier parts of the level, but here need to pick one, then go back through the other and then through one of them again. It breaks the sense of forward momentum, and it's really just a bit dull. All other levels, except for the new one at the end, suffer from this issue to some extent. This adds up to a game with worse level design than the game it's based on.\nThe final level also feels out of place. Suddenly the style of the level (in terms of how you play it) changes completely. If you've ever played a Mega Man game, then this level will feel familiar, because that's what it feels like. A Mega Man level (and not a well designed one). The soundtrack on this level also feels like something out of Mega Man.\n\nOptions?\nThe options menu is severely lacking. You can't even change the sound levels. It's more or less limited to resolution, AA, language, brightness and two pre-set key combinations for your jump attack. No, you can not even re-bind controls. While graphics options for a game like this is not super important, sound levels and re-binding controlls is just something that I've come to expect from any game with more than a minimal budget.\n\nThe big freeze-bug at the end\nThis is the reason why my review ends up negative. There is a bug near the end that freezes the game. It won't happen for everyone, but the amount of people I've seen reporting this seem to indicate that it's at least a relatively common bug. One that neither WayForward nor Capcom has bothered fixing. Exactly what causes the bug is unknown, but it does not seem to be due to a specific graphics card vendor, OS version or anything like that.\n\nClosing words\nEven without the bug, the frequent cutscenes and the frankly not great level design pulls this game down. The core gameplay is really good, but sadly the things surrounding it are not. Had they either stuck with the original level design, or designed brand new levels around the scavenger hunts you're supposed to partake in, then this game could easily have been a winner, but as it stands, it's just an alright game, with great graphics and sound, and a very serious bug near the end that might make it impossible for you to see the last boss.","December 31, 2015","false","3.7"," 63 of 78 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","63","78","0","0"

It was great and I still have fond memories of it. But I wasn't sure a remake would give me the same memories... On the one hand it's pretty much an exact remake of the original, but with improved graphics. On the other hand it' might not translate well enough, and, because of that, might scare gamers off. I'm sorry to say it's the latter.\nFirst, let me talk about the things Ducktales does right.\n\nThe graphics haven been upgraded with 2D HD sprites in a 2.5D world. It looks excellent, even if the backgrounds don't fit with the rest of the graphics. I personally think it would've been better if it was entirely in 2D. But that's a different story. The levels are exact replicas of the originals. Epic !\n\nThe gameplay is also kept the same. It's tough. But not too tough. Back when I was a kid it literally took me hours to complete a level. Maybe it was because I was too young and didn't fully understand games just yet, maybe because games were really more difficult back then. Ducktales Remastered tested my patience when I had only just started it. I was rushing through levels carelessly and I died several times in a matter of minutes. This is a good thing, mind you. It makes the game feel old school, in a certain way.\n\nBut despite the game being somewhat difficult it's also very short. Levels can be finished within 30-60 minutes and since there are only 6 levels in total you should complete it in about 5 or 6 hours max.\n\nThen the controls. The controls are pretty good, but jumping on your pogo stick doesn't seem to work all the time. Plenty of times have I tried jumping down, followed by a pogo stick jump and the game just didn't register the button being pressed. It cost me more health than intended.\n\nOh, and the voice acting... Man, the voice acting. The voice acting was cringeworthy. I understand it's based on the cartoon, but the dialogues in general were just terrible and childish. Same goes for the rest of the cutscenes. I skipped through them at one point because I couldn't take it anymore. Next time, no more voice acting please. Just a textbox would suffice.\n\nAnd maybe it's my memory, but I remember secrets being secrets in the original. Secrets in the remake are pointed out in obvious ways. All that's missing is a big arrow pointing to it. Like I said, it might just be my memory but I remember this differently.\nIf I had to rate this game right now I'd give it a 6,5, or 7 at best.\n\nDucktales is a decent game and still kinda fun to play, even now and especially if you have never played the original. But wait for a sale instead, because the current price is once again too high. Also, I think the Castle Of Illusion remake might be better in comparison. Let's just wait for that.\n\n[Rating: 67/100]","August 16, 2013","true","4.3"," 82 of 111 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","82","111","0","1"

I have to admit that although I did play it for a tiny bit back in the early 90's, my memory of the game is fairly fuzzy and I don't remember enough to make an appropriate comparison between the two. Furthermore, I did not get an nostalgic rush when playing this game like many others do.\n\nWith that said, I think the game has charm in its own right. First off, the presentation is fantastic. The graphics, the music, voicework etc. is exactly what you were hoping for. My only real complaint is that there are cutscenes *everywhere* in this game. Luckily, these are skippable (press Start and then go to "skip cutscene")\n\nAs for the gameplay itself, the game is very much in line with what was popular in the late 80's/early 90's. Unlike other difficult modern platformers (such as Super Meat Boy or Shovel Knight), Ducktales isn't so much difficult (none of the segments are particularly tricky) as it is punishing. What I mean by this is that unlike those games, you have a limited amount of lives, and once all your lives are gone, you begin back at the games hub and have to do everything in a certain level all over again. Without trying to spoil anything, this is particularly annoying on the last level of the game, where a single mistake at any point might set you back 10-15 minutes.\n\nOther than that, this is your standard run-of-the-mill platformer. You play as the infamous Scrooge McDuck and look for treasure in each of the levels (the order of which you can pick, ala Megaman, although bosses in these levels do *not* give you weapons so the order is less important). The gems you collect throughout the level can be used to unlock artwork and music, but as far as I know have no bearing on the actual gameplay itself. Each level has a boss at the end. The controls in the game seemed fairly tight.\n\nThe gameplay lasts approximately 4 hours for a quick runthrough (but this may vary greatly depending on how good or bad you are at platformers).

A unique mechanic (The Pogo Stick of Doom, wielded by ol'Scrooge) brings around a bouncing mechanic not found in normal 2D platformers. In an age where we see new and innovative stuff churned out in this genre almost every year, this project brought together the essence of the old NES Game.\n\nThis however brought along a few hiccups which are annoying at most. The cut-scenes are a wee bit dull, and only skippable if you select "Skip Cutscene" in the pause menu. The final boss is just as annoying as it was in the original which is either my bad memory, or an oversight.\n\nIn this nostalgia romp for yours truly, I enjoyed this game for exactly what it was. A trip down memory lane in the city of Duckburg, only done in a visual style that reminded me of an episode of the show.\n\n7.5/10. Would recommend to young ones, Platforming fiends, and those who have a soft spot for the penny-pinching McDuck Clan.","December 30, 2013","true","4.0"," 30 of 33 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","30","33","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yukichigai/recommended/237630/","yukichigai","Y|yukichigai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yukichigai/","463 products in account","There's been a trend in recent years to cash in on nostalgia in a big way.  Take an old game, give it a little bit of polish, release it again and rake in the dough.  Sometimes it's welcomed because its handled respectfully, while other times it's a shallow cash grab.  I am very happy to say that this is NOT a cash grab.  If anything, DuckTales: Remastered is an example of how a updated re-release should be done... mostly.\n\nSo, as per the usual formula, let's talk about the good to start.  First and foremost, the core of the original NES game, what made that game a beloved masterpiece, is still there and fully intact.  Scrooge still has his bizarre pogo stick ability that is as inexplicable as it is fun, and the levels still stick to the same general layout, even having the same locations for pickups.  The game's tunes are also the same, save for being performed by real instruments rather than an 8-bit chiptune processor.  If you thought the Moon theme was catchy in chiptune, wait till you hear it now.\n\nOf course, that's not to say the game is just a graphical update without any other changes.  DuckTales: Remastered adds some new content to the game, most of it welcome.  While the levels are mostly the same, there have been some minor alterations and changes, most for the better in terms of level flow.  Bosses in particular have been changed up so that they have more than the same single attack pattern to work with, making them far more challenging (though not unfairly so) than their pushover NES incarnations. There are even two additional levels: an intro training level and a final boss level, both with new soundtracks that fit in quite nicely with the rest of the tunes.  The final level in particular was a surprising addition, and is far more satisfying than the original game's "go through this level you already beat" concept of a final level, albeit with a caveat I'll talk about later.\n\nProbably the best thing DuckTales: Remastered brings to the game are the fully voiced characters.  Rather than just relying on canned sound effects and clips from the show, the game actually uses newly recorded lines from the original voice cast (minus the ones who, tragically, are no longer with us).  Yes, this includes Alan Young as Scrooge, sounding surprisingly good for being 92 years old.  Scrooge obviously has plenty of time to say a variety of things, what with all the pogoing and gathering treasure and whatnot, but the other characters get plenty of time to speak, too.  Mostly this happens during cutscenes that occur between and sometimes in the middle of the levels.  These cutscenes are true to the original series, and do a great job of explaining some of the more inexplicable parts of the original NES game; why was Bubba Duck frozen in ice, for example.\n\nCutscenes aren't without downsides though, which brings me to the next part of the review: the bad. As I said, cutscenes can happen in the middle of levels, which can get very tiring on repeated playthroughs of the game.  You can skip them, but it does take a few seconds to do so, and quite a few are placed such that even that can be a noticeable interruption.  The game also has some serious issues with recognizing all but the most common monitor resolutions, and really didn't like my 16:10 monitor at all.  I was able to get around it by manually altering the game's ini file to use my specific resolution, but it's still something that could have been handled better.  The most maddening thing for me though is that in keeping true to the core of the original game, much of its buggy movement behavior was kept in as well, especially the random things that could cause Scrooge to stop pogoing for no easily apparent reason.  Any fan of the original NES title won't be surprised, but the movement quirks could have been ironed out without angering most people, or at the very least with an optional toggle as was done for the requirement to hold the pogo button while bouncing, a.k.a. "Hard Pogo Mode".\n\nThe only other thing I can add about this game is only arguably a downside, but I found it somewhat negative all the same, that being the significantly increased difficulty of the final boss fight (and beyond) compared to the original game.  It's not impossible by any means, but it's still quite the jump in challenge.  I'll freely admit it had me frustrated for a little bit.\n\nDespite the few bad things in this remake, there's clearly far more good things to say about it. Ultimately though, DuckTales: Remastered is a bit of a victim of time, with its gameplay style not nearly as popular by today's standards, not to mention the waning popularity of the DuckTales franchise.  That said, it's still a solid platformer with a lot going for it, and very little going against it.  Fans of the original game will love this update, and people who have never played either can get quite a bit out of it, too, but you might want to watch a few episodes of the original show first.","November 1, 2014","true","6.0"," 27 of 29 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","27","29","0","0"

Besides, I can still remember the song (in French) for Duck Tales, the cartoon. And I still remember the pogo stick, the Amazon and the Moon.\n\nDuckTales Remastered is an improved version of the original game. Oncle Scrooge (or Picsou in French) is searching for a mythical artefact with the help of all the gang (the nephews and niece, the chopper pilot, the crazy inventor) and pitched against some enemies (the witch, the scottish billionnaire, the thiefs). I'm sorry if I'm not giving the English names, as I'm used to Geo Trouvetou, Mystique or Riri, Fifi and Loulou (who are Huey, Dewey and Louie) and as names.\n\nAnyway, dear Scrooge will visit the Amazon, some African mines, a haunted castle in Transylvania, the Everest and the Moon, without forgetting a volcano where the big fight will arrive. If he can jump, he can also use his cane as pogo stick to reach heights or to throw stuff. As part of a classic platformer, you can improve your health or find secret areas with bonuses. The score is determined by the value of the diamonds you've found (whether they're hidden in chests or not). Unless they're in chests, you have to pass on the zone they're to make them appear. But they're only there temporary: you have to take them quickly.\n\nAlso, the enemies are typical of the level visited: gorillas, spiders and snakes in the Amazon (without forgetting the tribemen), mummies, bats and ghosts in Transylvania, etc... Each level is ending with a boss to defeat, though some are just mad at you for another story, like the Yeti for example.\n\nAnyway, the good part of the game is that you can unlock art gallery thanks to the money you're accumulating during the levels. If you start a new game, it's not erased, which is great. But during a same playthrough, you can't replay a level. Once it's done, it's done. You can't go back for secrets you've missed or for achievements. Anyway, if you're starting a new game, generally, it's because you want to try it at a higher level.\n\nThe graphics are very colorful, anyway, you can't expect a dark setting for a remastering of a game that was already oriented towards children at the time. Everything is well polished..... APART FOR A FREEKING FREEZING BUG FOR PEOPLE WITH NVIDIA CARDS ON THE FINAL BOSS! IMPOSSIBLE TO FINISH THE GAME!\n\nAnd that's where all the good found in the game is crushed because the developers aren't trying to patch the game for that game-breaking bug. It's just sad that I can't finish the game.\n\nSo yeah, while DuckTales isn't perfect as there is only audio in English, that the game is for people having played it and finding some good memories, while DuckTales, despite that, is a very good game until the end, should I thumb it down or up?\n\nI'm tempted to thumb it down but I've enjoyed it the game for 90% of it, apart the bug.

With the help of your three nephews you will face different scenarios like the forest, snow environments and dark underground mines (among other places).

This in itself would not be enough for me to give a negative review. However gamebreaking bugs are a very valid reason for a negative review.\n\n\nThe bug occurs at the final boss. The game freezes sometimes in the cutscene before the final battle sometimes into the final battle or if you can make it through it without freezing in the cutscene afterwards. This bug has existed for approx 2 years and will not be patched as there is some license issue with Capcom(the publishers) Wayforward( the devs) and Disney (the license holder). On a side note I had very similiar problems with another Wayforward game Double Dragon Neon so I will be taking extra care when looking into any of their games in the future.\n\nI did manage to find a workaround to enable me to finish the game but it was a little awkward and less computer savvy people may be hesitant to try it. And frankly it ruined what would have otherwise been a fairly pleasant experience and I or other paying customers should not have to go to these lenghts to play their game.\n\nFor anyone that is unlucky enough to have bought this and is outside the refund window heres what I did to get it working but YMMV.\n\n1. Launch the game\n2. Alt Tab out of the game and open task manager\n3. Find Ducktales.exe, right click and go to Set Affinity...\n4. Change the affinity from 4(For me, it may be 2 or more depending on your system) to just 1 of the CPUs (I doubt it matters but I used CPU 0\n5. Play the game until you get to the boss and the cutscene starts, pause the game and skip cutscene. ( You can watch it on Youtube )\n6. Fight and win final boss battle and when the cutscene starts pause again and skip the cutscene.\n7. Thereis a short escape scenatio to play through then. The game froze on me during this the first time but I managed to get through it on the first attempt the second go. I have no idea if the lenght of time I had been on the scene caused the crash but I would suggest trying to get through it as quickly as possible.\n\nSo to sum up do not buy this game, it is broken and will never be fixed.

I could go on about this, but if you haven't watched the 'Duckumentaries' above (and on YouTube) they do a great job of showing the process they went through to update it.\n\nSound design is fantastic, but the game's music was the audio portion done with the most love of the original NES source material.  It is nothing short of beautiful and nostalgic.  The composer went above and beyond keeping close to original compositions, but updated them perfectly to full orchestrations.  I can not fathom how this could have been handled any better.  The calm, smoothness of the stage select music coupled with the act of performing a swan dive into Scrooge's money bin hit my nostalgia nerve very hard.  Nothing has pulled me back to the happiness of my childhood like that did in a long time.  The other impressive bit in the area of audio was the use of what I believe is the entire original voiceover cast from the cartoon which adds another layer of authenticity and enjoyment to this game.  And when I say everyone I mean all the way from Scrooge (Alan Young was 93 I believe when he recorded this) all the way down to Webigail and even Duckworth the butler has a couple of lines.\n\nThe gameplay remains wholly unchanged from the original.  The pogo can be a little frustrating every now and again, but it always was and isn't in any way crippling here.  Also, the addition of added difficulties is welcome since the original was very unforgiving in this area.  The main change is the addition of a whole new final level - Mount Vesuvius which takes the place of returning to Transylvania in the original.  A difficult final stage that is well conceived and fits in with the rest of the game well.  The final bit of the game after your battle with Dracula Duck is a homage to what the old 8-bit twitch reaction platformers could be.  The game is a tiny bit short, but that's hardly a criticism since the orignal was the same and only took more time due to the unforgiving difficulty.\n\nOverall, this is a wonderful game for all ages, especially those old-school gamers of us in our 30s that loved these old 8-bit platformers.  I am definitely keeping my eye on anything WayForward does from here on because they clearly know how to make, not just a good game, but how to make it fun and its refreshing to see a developer who seems to really care about what they're doing versus raking in the cash as the primary motivator.  If they ever got their hands on Capcom's 8-bit MegaMan library (especially this same music composer) I would be all over that.","December 7, 2013","true","98.7"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

From the colorful sprites of all our favorite characters, to the original voices from the cartoon show, and the theme song, everything feels so perfect at the beginning. It really isn't just a "remake" of the original game, it's also a reunion for people who were fans of the show as well.\n\nWith colorful graphics, tight controls, fun gameplay, and great music, Remastered also attempts to make fans of the original game feel at home. However, with the inclusion of many pesky and intruding cutscenes, the wonderful flow of the game grinds to a complete halt. Some can be welcome -- introducing a new level or terrifying boss. But other cutscenes will activate whenever you complete trivial "objectives", which can be anything from finding a token or aiding Launchpad fix his plane. They interupt a bit too often, and while there is an option to skip these (by pausing the game during the cutscene, selecting "skip cutscene", then confirming), sometimes there's two or three back to back, making you have to awkwardly repeat the process. It doesn't help that if you Game Over and have to repeat a stage... well, get ready to skip all those cutscenes again! I understand they were just trying to add story to a game where there was none (except perhaps in the instruction manual of the original), however, it is still frustrating to repeatedly have to keep skipping cutscenes.\n\nDespite that one flaw, DuckTales Remastered is an easy game to get into and a very rewarding one to complete. Scrooge and all his companions are back for a DuckTales encore that seemed long overdue. And I'm very happy to have been apart of it! DuckTales fans, pick this one up! Fans of the original game or just fans of old school side-scrollers in general, maybe wait til it's on sale.\n\nHappy adventuring!!!","February 22, 2014","true","14.2"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

I've just finished the game on Hard and overall I love it.\n\nGraphically it's fantastic. It's like playing the old cartoon\nGameplay is spot on. Jumping, pogo'ing, etc all feel tight. It's rewarding finding all the hidden spots for gems, health, and 1-ups, just like the original.\nSound is great too. Almost all of the original voice actors are back and they do a great job of stepping into their old roles.\n\nThis is what an HD remake should be.

Drawn cartoon sprites, the official voice actors, and the levels and gameplay very closely follow the original game, with tweaks and updates that I like. Lots of dialogue has been added as well, giving it more of its own storyline to follow. I like that you can jump into your money bin and sort of swim around, just for fun. I played the original NES game again just before this one, and I found the ways that they managed to update the game while still staying faithful to the original were pretty clever. I'm not a big fan of the new tutorial level (Scrooge's Moneybin); it's just not as interesting as the rest of the game, but it is just a tutorial I guess. Also, Scrooge doesn't sound as energetic or enthusiastic as he probably should for the situation (demanding his nephews be set free or narrowly escaping death), but it's still pretty  awesome that the original voice actor for Scrooge (now in his 90's) voiced it.\n\nGameplay wise, it's the same as the original, with some tweaks. A 2D platformer with a pogo-cane attack. There is a extra heart powerup hidden within each level, as well. I played through the game on "easy" and found it very easy to complete (you have unlimited lives). I can see it becoming a challenge on the harder difficulties, though, since the bosses are by far the most challenging parts of the game.\n\nI really enjoyed it, and would recommend it to people who enjoy oldschool platformers, and ESPECIALLY fans of the original NES game.","December 9, 2014","true","5.8"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","1"

Leave no survivors.\n\nI was too young to play Capcom's Ducktales when it originally came to the NES back in 1990 (I was two years old then), but I made up for it by playing the game constantly when it was available on the NEStalgia online emulator a few years back.\n\nWhat a treat, then, that Ducktales Remastered (a port/remake developed by Wayforward Technologies) is light-years ahead of the original version. I don't think it's hyperbole to say that this is a faithful remake that does justice to the license while throwing a boatload of extra content for longtime fans.\n\nThe original game had what can best be described as an "excuse plot" - you journey around the world to find five treasures, and at the end Flintheart Glomgold and Magica de Spell show up to ruin your party and force you to lose them again. The remake goes much, much further than this, to the point that I would characterize it as a "mini-season" of the series. There's an honest-to-God story this time, which ranks up there with some of the best episodes of the show.\n\nYou begin the game as Scrooge McDuck, racing to the scene of an attempted break-in by the Beagle Boys at your Money Bin. Once you take care of the intruders, several things open up to you - a gallery where you can purchase unlockable content (ranging from character sketches to a sound test, complete with the 8-bit retro soundtrack), the legendary Vault - yes, you can go swimming in it, complete with "gold-spewing" animations - and your choice of levels from the computer, just like the original.\n\nThe best thing about the game is that it is filled with continuity nods and nostalgia galore. Everything from unused items in the prototype version of the original game, to nods to various episodes and character concepts, to little in-jokes based on the level design of its predecessor, is on full display here. Pogo jumping on enemies and racking up as much treasure as you can still feels as great as it did before. It's a game that was clearly made by fans of the series, and it shows in spades.\n\nI could spend an hour rattling off all the ways I love this game. Running away from a giant boulder as Scrooge yells "Children and billionaires first!" at the top of his lungs. The lampshade hanging of why you can breathe on the moon. The way all of the supporting characters get much more screentime and characterization, and how their jokes fit so seamlessly with the lore (Glomgold and Scrooge's rivalry, anyone?). The way they still managed to capture the tight controls of the pogo stick from the original. Alan Young seamlessly jumping back into the Scrooge character, despite being 94(!) at the time of recording his lines. The extra Money Bin/Vesuvias levels. The New Game Plus mode. The "light muzak" version of the Moon theme that plays over the end credits. Mega-Dracula Duck trying to chomp you. Gizmoduck is a bro that kills anything in your path.\n\nYou get the idea.\n\nI don't say this lightly. This is an incredible tribute to the series. I'd even go so far to say that this is one of the best Disney products ever made. We're taking "Legend of the Chaos God"/Castle of Illusion-tier quality, folks. It was made by people who poured their heart and soul into making it as good as it can be.\n\nFrom a difficulty standpoint, this game isn't for children. Even on the Easy difficulty level, there are level portions and boss battles that are much more taxing than the original incarnations. The Amazon/Incan relic boss fight in particular has you using near split-second timing to avoid crushing walls that come in from all sides.\n\nThe quality of the port is also somewhat lacking. You can clearly tell that this port was a rush job to get it out to PC audiences - the command prompts at Scrooge's office have an "A" button prompt (you have to press Space to activate it by default), and I experienced slowdown at a couple points in Transylvania and the Money Bin.\n\nI didn't experience the dreaded "end boss crash" others have reported. Rather, the game locked up when I was near the end of the Moon level, causing me to lose a half-hour of playtime. All things considering, a few technical glitches are a moot point.\n\nDucktales Remastered is an amazing achievement. It makes me wonder what Wayforward could do with other franchises. You can't tell me that a Talespin or Chip'n Dale: Rescue Rangers remake wouldn't be awesome. Hell, this game makes me excited to see what they could do with Ducktales 2, the more technically advanced NES sequel that made a lot of changes to the formula.\n\nIf you value your childhood and love this series, go out and get it now.","September 25, 2015","true","41.2"," 21 of 35 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","21","35","3","1"

I was really only interested because WayForward was involved, and because I'd heard stories that the NES game was actually pretty great.\n\nWell, lo and behold, I actually loved DuckTales: Remastered. Virt did a fantastic job on remaking the music, and everyone involved did a great job at updating the levels, and, apparently, adding two new ones. The somewhat open-like gameplay that a few levels had gave me a bit of a Metroid vibe, something I was not expecting from a game based on talking ducks.\n\nThe only real negative I'd have with this game is the constant cutscenes. The writing is rather charming, like watching an old 80's Disney cartoon, but they start to get on your nerves when they play every five minutes. It's also a rather short game, as my first run of the game, on PS3, took about 4 hours. However, this is one of the few games that, immediately after I finished, I began again on a higher difficulty.\n\nThe bosses are fun to fight, the stages are fun to traverse, the music is great, and the controls work well enough.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamerrubrix/recommended/237630/","gamerrubrix","Gamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamerrubrix/","300 products in account","DuckTales Remastered is a 2D Platformer. It's, as the title implies, a remaster of the original 8-Bit NES game DuckTales. The story is about Scrooge McDuck and his 3 nephews searching for ancient treasures around the world to become the richest duck in the world.\n\nThe game is a rather simplistic platformer, but it's charming and fun in lots of ways. You play as Scrooge, who has the ability to jump on his cane like a pogo stick. This gives Scrooge lots of extra height, and it's also the main way to defeat any enemies in the way and cross dangerous obstacles. The pogo jump can be done indefinitely unless you take damage, so it's pretty much the primary bit of platforming you're gonna do. Gameplay doesn't have lots of depth, but it does a good job at what it aims to do: Controls are super precise, platforming bits are fun, game is moderately challenging, and enemies are a threat. So that's what matters most, all of it's gameplay mechanics are solid.\n\n\n\n\nDuckTales consists of 7 levels (Including the tutorial level). You go around exploring, trying to find all the gems and diamonds you can, then subsequently fighting the boss at the end of each stage to get the valued treasure. Every level also has some items you need to find to advance to the next section, which encourages the exploration aspect. Now, don't go around thinking it's gonna be like a Metroidvania, because it's not. It has little tidbits of exploration, but it's not very abundant. The good news is that each level has it's own enemies and gimmicks to it, so you'll never feel like you're playing the same thing over and over again. They're not very long, nor are they very big. But like I said, for what there is, it's good and gets the job done.\n\n\n\n\nThe visuals and soundtrack for this game are incredible. Every song, excluding the new levels, are remixes from the NES game, and they sound spectacular. Jake Kaufman, who does the OST for Shovel Knight and Shantae, did a fantastic job on the music here. The graphics really do capture the spirit of the original DuckTales cartoon, each of the characters are hand drawn 2D while the background and objects are 3D. The 3D bits don't look as good as the 2D characters, but they work well to make a cartoonish and fitting environment and all that.\n\nSpeaking of which, the game has LOTS of cutscenes, so it kinda feels like an episode of the show if you wanna look at it like that. Some of the original voice actors from the TV show are present, such as Alan Young playing Scrooge. (The dude is in his 90s, mad respect.) However, some people might not like the cutscenes since they show up a lot in the middle of gameplay, whether it's reaching a new area or finding a collectible. They're very abundant, but many felt like it interrupted gameplay. (Tip, you can skip them my pausing and pressing "Skip Cinematic".)\n\n\n\nThe game has 4 difficulties: Easy, Normal, Hard, and Extreme. Every gamer will probably find their preferred difficulty whether you wanna take a stroll through the game or ramp it up to hardcore levels. The harder difficulty you choose, the less health related items there will be, which will instead be replaced by more money or 1-Ups. Also, after you beat a level, you'll get some bonus cash for it. The higher your difficulty, the more your cash bonus is. Extreme can only be unlocked after you beat the game on Hard, and it takes after the NES game. You have to beat it all in one sitting, and if you get a game over, you need to start from the very beginning of the game.\n\n\n\nSo anyway, DuckTales is a good remake of the NES game and a solid platformer with not much depth to it. It's also rather short, clocking in about 2-3 hours for 1 playthrough. However, if you're into platformers or just wanna spend some time on a pretty decent game, go get it on a sale.\n\n7/10","February 20","true","8.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

The devs have taken the levels and layout from the original 1989 version and expanded them to enchance the gameplay even further.  The graphics, music and story have been recreated and even surviving members of the animated series lend their voices.  New areas are included in the original game's levels and bosses are given new patterns.  The game even comes with two new levels exclusive to this version of the game.\n\nIt certainly is a nostalgia trip and I would highly recommend it to fans of the original, but I would also recommend it to any fan of 2D side scrollers.  It is quite difficult, which makes it enjoyable.  Various difficulties are included and despite the game being quite short, it does offer some replay value if you attempt the Extreme difficulty.\n\nI recommend picking this up in a sale and experiencing a remastered version of a great NES game.  It will at least occupy you for a couple of hours!","November 28, 2014","true","3.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/237630/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nDuckTales: Remastered was a work of love from the developers at WayForward, the game brings a fresh new experience to a classic video game from the NES (Nintendo Entertainment System - for you younsters). DuckTales is a 2D Platformer where you play as Scrooge McDuck visiting various places on earth and the moon, collecting treasure.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=502954092\n\n\n-Disclaimer-\nI hate to point this out... but the game did freeze on the last boss. I had to skip the cinematic to get through it (after replaying the level). But not everyone has the opportunity to skip. Just check the forums and you'll see that the most common problem in the game is freezing on the final boss.\nI still recommend this game because I absolutely love it! But, buyer beware, you might get to the last level and not be able to finish the game. :-/\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=504349456\n\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory: Scrooge McDuck is the richest duck in the world, he is quite the treasure hunter and adventure seeker. In between treasure hunting and adventures he seems to be perpetually trying to protect his money vault from the “Beagle boys”.\nIn DuckTales: Remastered you will visit the Jungles, Arctic, Transylvania, Mines and even the moon. You are visiting these places to collect precious treasures, that Scrooge learned about from a painting.\n\nHere's some history for those of you who like gaming history; the original DuckTales game was developed by Capcom and released on the NES in 1989 in North America. Additionally the places you visit within the game are actually episodes from the DuckTales Disney Cartoon Series that aired in the late 1980's and early 1990's.\n\nGameplay: The controls are very simple, you move, jump, and Pogo with your cane. The controls are tight and very responsive. It's very easy to get the hang of the controls, however implementing them in the various platformer challenges in the game will reward the player with plenty of difficulty.\n\nAchievements: There are 20 achievements in DuckTales: Remastered, there are three achievement categories: Achieved while playing, Beat the game on the hardest difficulty, and Secret achievements.\nAfter my first play through I had 15 achievements, it is important to note that I play quite thoroughly so I usually get a lot of achievements on my first play through. This game will take a few different play through depending on how careful you are to collect as much as possible.\nThe toughest achievements worth noting are: Beat the game on extreme difficulty, “Look Ma, No spats”, and I missed two hidden achievements on my first play through.\n\nPrice: DuckTales: Remastered is priced at $14.99, I had this game on my wishlist and was waiting for a sale before purchasing it, but a friend bought it for me on my birthday. (Thanks Helen! :D )\nI felt this game is completely worth the price, there are qualities that I don't even touch in my review that I ADORE about this game: The Music, the artistic style, the sense of progression, and the nostalgia factor.\n\nConclusion: To quickly recap, Story: Awesome, and endearing if you've watched the DuckTales Cartoon series or played the original DuckTales for the NES. Gameplay: simple, yet having plenty of difficulty. Achievements: Most of them are earned on your first play through, but there are always those tough achievements keeping you away from 100% without a struggle.\n\nOnce more, you should be careful when purchasing this game because the last boss might actually freeze/crash your game. But other then that I have nothing negative I could say about this game.\n\nI recommend Ducktales to anyone who enjoys platformers, fans of the series, people who played the classic NES game, and anyone who likes supporting Indie game developers.\n------Edits and updates------\nEdit/Update August, 22, 2015:\nAdded Screenshots","August 22, 2015","true","10.4"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

Ducktales: Remastered, the remake to the classic NES Ducktales game. The game opens up with an awesome 8-bit/modern remix of the Ducktales theme on the title screen, then we jump into the games story. Scrooge McDuck, the richest duck in Duckburg, uncovers a map hidden in an old painting that leads to some hidden treasures. So he imbarks on his quest to find them with the help of his friends. The game is a classic 2D Sidescroller game that relies on your wits and skill. The gameplay focuses on Scrooge's cane and jump ability. The cane is used to hit objects or to bounce around like a pogo stick. Gems are hidden everywhere so keep a close watch on where they are scattered. They are used to buy art galleries from the game and the TV show it was based off of, or to fill up Scrooges Money Bin. It's always been a fans dream to dive into his money bin, and now they finally get the chance to do so. The game is faithful to the original with it's upgraded graphics, remixed soundtrack, and challenging gameplay. It's even more surprising that they were able to get most of the original voice actors from the TV Show to reprise their respective roles. It feels like a breath of fresh air to hear Scrooge, Launchpad, the Beagle Boys and others back again after all these years. June Foray still manages to get so carried away as usual, and Alan Young is still smarter than the smarties, and tougher than the toughies. The new voice actors thatfill in the other characters like Flintheart Glumgold do a good job in bringing these characters to life. Each level feels like playing through an episoide of Ducktales, espically when the graphics are to resemble the traditional animation that the TV show had, you don't see that kind of animation anymore in recent years. This game isn't a walk in the park, unless your an expert on the original game. It's very challenging with it's difficulty, you know your playing a classic hard game when extra lives are hard to come by. The last level is probably the hardest level ever, no matter what difficulty your on. After defeating the final boss, it then goes into a race against Scrooge and Flintheart and Magica De Spell in retriving Scrooge's Number One Dime. After you've succedded in doing that, it then leads into a race for survival by climbing up chains while the lava is flowing upwards, one false move and your finished. It's been so long since I've played a game where I'm tense all over, the fast paced music and it's setting really gets you pumped up. Even after making it to the top, I can still feel my heart beating out of my chest. So if your in the mood for a game that is a throwback to the golden age of video games or if your a Ducktales fan, than this game will saticfy you as it has already saticfied me. So what are ya waiting for? Buy it now! It's worth every penny, as long as it's not some of Scrooge's pennies. lol","January 6, 2014","true","22.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

The blend of 2D and 3D art is perfect and the animations are nothing but superb. The game plays well like an old school action platformer and though the story is simple and silly it has the Disney charm making it fun to play through.\n\nSo why I am not going to recommend this game to buyers?\n\nWell the game played great for me throughout the first 5 levels, but on the last level, right before the last boss, the game crashes.   I mean, honestly, what frustrates me the most is that the crash happens right before the last boss, RIGHT BEFORE!  No matter what I do, reinstall game, skip cinematics, sacrifice a horned toad to the gods of computer crashing, nothing.  I cannot finish this game!   So therefore, I cannot recommend anyone to buy it.\n\nI have read this issue happens to some people, can't really say a lot of people, but surely some.

Then again, maybe you'll run into the exact same issue I have, or worst.\n\nIn any case, buy this flawed gem at your own risk.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kreegath/recommended/237630/","Kreegath","Kreegath","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kreegath/","227 products in account","This is a hard game to review; because while it's by no means a trainwreck, it's lacking in every aspect of what I felt made the original game for the NES so good. I played the original when it first came out as my older brother got it for christmas, so my heavy bias of childhood nostalgia will probably make the motivations for not recommeding "Ducktales: Remastered" quite different from someone getting into Ducktales now, through online buzz, hype and word-of-mouth.\nThe aspects that made the original so great for me were the tight controls, the fast-paced gameplay and the memorable music.  In this game, all three of those aspects fall short of living up to the NES version.\n\nI tried playing the game with the keyboard at first, but that turned out to be nothing short of a horrid experience. The wonky hitboxes were made much worse by the *extremely* sluggish controls. You could hit enemies with your pogo stick and still take damage, while killing them at the same time. Also, some areas require you to abort your pogo jump mid-air to not hit the ceiling or an enemy waiting at the top of the screen, which with the keyboard controller was just blind luck as the game hardly ever responded fast enough, making you overjump or underjump woth little to no fault of your own. Getting a gamepad helped out a bunch, making the game playable again, with a barely passing grade. However, barely passing isn't good enough for something which purports to have remastered the NES version. Rose-coloured glasses aside, going back to the original, you *clearly* feel a difference in the controls. The response time here just is not up to the standards of a 22(?) year older game, and that partly ruins the experience.\n\nIn regards to the fast-paced gameplay, I'm again sad to report that the remake falls short by leaps and bounds. Every other minute you are rudely interrupted from playing the game by it just pausing to play a cutscene. I found an option to turn off cutscenes, but even with that option active you will still find yourself annoyed by constant roadblocks on every part of every level. They add nothing to the experience, it's just a completely unnecessary (shoe-horned in) storyline that goes against the very concept of the game, to send you on a action-packed, exploration and treasure seeking adventure. In this regard the remake gets a failing grade, it does not live up to the original.\n\nThe music is a matter of preference. Either you like it or you activate the original soundtrack. I found the remade music entirely pointless. It felt way over-produced and intrusive, like they felt they had to change it for the sake of changing it. The original soundtrack is, in old-school gaming circles, almost legendary. There's no need to ever change from it to the new, inferior stuff in my opinion. Additionally, it's worth mentioning the extremely wooden and lifeless voice acting job. The voices aren't bad, you can clearly hear who's who and whom they are supposed to sound like, but it's just so incredibly uninspired and unengaged. Makes the jokes fall flat and it completely drains all energy out of the gaming sections between cutscenes.\n\nI can't recommend this game for these reasons. It's got sluggish and irritating controls, bad sound and choppy and uneven gameplay. It got everything wrong about what the original got right, and it doesn't add anything of value to the NES game. You can watch a playthrough on youtube instead of wasting money on this game. Or, better yet, play the (again in my opinion) far superior original to this pale imitation.","January 25, 2014","false","29.6"," 21 of 38 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","21","38","0","0"

This is an enhanced remake of the (at least for some) classic Ducktales game for the Nintendo Entertainment System.  An old fashioned platformer, that game has been transformed into something more, while still remaining true to it's roots.\n\nThe game has a new introduction/tutorial stage, a new final stage, new sprites and stage models, an animated, hand-drawn look, and a new overarching story of why Scrooge and the boys are off to gather random treasures (a story which was not contained in any real measure in the original game).  It also has voice work from almost all the old cast from the show (Flintheart Glomgold's voice actor had died, and was replaced with the current voice actor for the character).\n\nEach stage is a typical platformer game stage, where items are collected, enemies are jumped on (pogo'd on is more appropriate of a term) and areas of spikes, jumps and secrets are traversed in order to get to the end of the stage where a boss battle always lurks.  The changes are interesting: the player now has a map a la Super Metroid and the like, items that must be collected in many of the stages to progress further, and hidden life-ups to add a heart of life in each stage.  Each stage also plays like a mini episode of Ducktales, with a story beginning and end cinema scene.  Then, that stage becomes locked until you beat the game, after which you can revisit basically any stage.\n\nThe game is solid, the nostalgia factor is high, the run time is short ( I have 70% of the achievements and I've only played it for about 5 hours) and it's a beautiful and fun game.  For some people, $15 might be a bit much for the game (I remember getting it on sale for at least 50% off), but if your nostalgia factor is high enough, this is a great game at any price.","May 1, 2014","true","5.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I had to look up a fix - which unfortunately was skipping the cinematic right after the battle finishes - since the developers aren't supporting the game anymore at all. So maybe do keep that in mind if purchasing.\n\nAlthough even with the bug issues, I think it deserves your time and attention, and even more so if you love DuckTales.

I'm going to effort to express English (Because I'm a Mexican).\nThis game is a (obviously) a Remake of the NES Game "DuckTales", a classical platformer made it for Capcom (I miss you Capcom) based in a cartoon with the same name made it by Disney. Well, this game was developed by WayFoward, who actually some people know WF for make Contra 4 and/or Movies and Cartoon adaptations in Videogames, actually I know WayForward for make Shantae games and the Mighty Series (Mighty Flip Champs, Mighty Milky Way and Mighty Switch Force 1 and 2). This game, for be a remake, have high quality in graphics and Soundtrack than the Original 8-bits game.\nThis game have good animations in the Character sprites, like a modern version of the cartoon.\nThe controls are simple, and I like it, because, for being a Classical Platformer, no need a lots of buttons for play the game, also, the controls in the game they are completly responsive, and that make the game frustrateless.\nThe gameplay is good for me and for Gamers who likes Scroll Platformers or, posible, not like it so much. The problem of the game is the replay... Complete the game make it boring for playing for some hours, but for me is not a problem, because I like platformers, and that not make me boring.\nThe soundtrack... Oh god! I'm just going to say 2 things: The Soundtrack of this game is the 2nd game with the best soundtrack I ever hear (the 1st was Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney) and my favorite song in-game is Mount Vesuvius and the Escape in Mount Vesuvius. Also, they are added new OST for the new stage and the game, like the Mount Vesuvius and the Escape, the Final Boss, Intro Stage, etc. and possible to change the Soundtrack for this game into a 8-bits songs, and the new songs (except the Final Boss) have its 8-bits version.\nThe differences between the 8-bit and the Remake: All the bosses (including the Final Boss) have a boss theme, in the Remake, The Final Boss have a different boss theme. At the moment to defeat the Final Boss, in the 8-bit original, you just need to get up using a rope, and the Remake have obstacules, make it hard for some players. The boss battle are simples, because limitations of the NES, and the remake make the bosses a little hard than before. The Final Stage in the 8-bits game was Transilvania (again) and the Remake, the Final Stage is the Generic Volcano-themed Stage who people loves, named Mount Vesuvius... And that's all I know the differences... Because I never play the original from NES, but I see some videos in Youtube. D:\nMy opinion? This is a good old school game for play, the game is a platformer, but different to other Scroll Platformers, this is a good remake for the fans of the cartoon or the NES game. Also, its have some old school """bugs""" like the dissapear of some object if you move the screen.\nWell, that's all... Yeah, this is the worst review ever!","February 2, 2014","true","10.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The original game was solid aside from it's obvious NES limitations, like color palette and awkward text-based storytelling in the corner.\n\nWayForward took the original game's foundation and didn't fix what wasn't broken; Scrooge's arsenal is still just his cane. What they did do, however, is expand the original levels in a method that is fitting of the source material, take the original music and orchestrate it, nab the surviving voice actors to act out their rolls (the only changes are Flintlock, Gyro, Fenton and Mrs. Beakly, all whom have passed away) and redo all the art assets with Disney talent assisting with staying true to the style of the show. The attention to detail is pretty amazing, and without a doubt this is the best Disney game out there.\n\nWayForward even, against all odds, managed to get a DuckTales appropriate story to go along with the original game's pieced together story, and it works pretty well considering. Not only that, but they managed to keep the difficulty of the game, and ramping it up in some parts. It's refreshing that the game isn't tuned down for the 21st century, as it really is a classic.\n\nIf you're a fan of DuckTales (in my case: it's my favorite Disney franchise) and enjoyed the original game, $15 is going to be a steal for this sort of opportunity. The game is short, so it's value drops considerably if you're not a fan of the show, the old NES game, or platformers in general, but it's definitely a mechanically solid and fun game, and worth your time if you've missed Duckberg these last 20 years.","August 13, 2013","true","16.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I wasn't a big fan of the show when I was a kid. (I was more of a Darkwing Duck kid) Right away I was disappointed that the backgrounds and items were not hand drawn like the sprites were. The sprites look great but they are placed overtop of very generic uninspired 3D backgrounds. Castle of Illusions, however, uses all 3D animation and it blends together wonderfully. The backgrounds feel as alive as the foregrounds.\n\nMoving Scrooge McDuck around is basic enough. Bounce on his cane to attack and occasionally swing at objects to bat them across the room. Things like climbing ropes felt strange as I could not jump from rope to rope but rather just fall and hope to catch ahold of another rope. Controlling Mickey Mouse was much more fun in Castle of Illusions. The mouse has ups and when you jump it's fun. Gameplay mechanics felt much more polished whereas Scrogge McDuck's controls were straight out of 8 bit NES era and not necessarily in a good nostalgic way.\n\nThe cutscenes in Duck Tales come often and they are corny and repeat themselves unnecessarily. I found myself skipping cutscenes I hadn't even watched for the first time rather quickly into my experience.\n\nAnd this is the big one for me. Once you exhaust all of your lives in Duck Tales you have to go back to the very beginning of the level and find all of the items over again. Classic old school gameplay. Although when you add that mechanic you better be sure you have a strong game. When I died and went back to the beginning of the Amazon level, I didn't want to do all of that over again mainly because it wasn't that fun to do to begin with. In Castle of Illusions when Mickey was booted out of a room and made to start again I looked forward to having another go at it. That initial reaction to "starting a level over" in a game will always tell me whether or not I am enjoying the game.\n\nSo in conclusion if you are into the Disney characters or just want a cartoon platformer and find a few Disney toons (Scrooge McDuck is basically a spin on Donald Duck) on your wishlist -- go with Castle of Illusions over Duck Tales: Remastered.","February 7","false","0.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

DuckTales and DuckTales 2 were my favorite platformers and my childhood was built on them. They had solid controls and cool boss fights.\n\nDuckTales: Remastered is a full overhaul in graphics and sound but still has that perfect DuckTales feel into it.\n\nThe controls and gameplay are the same. The character controls perfectly and the pogo stick attack obeys your every move accurately. You still kill the enemies like you used to in DuckTales NES. The developers made great choices with this.\n\nFor the graphics, it looks cartoony and cute. It fits and is a perfect modern look for the original NES title. The animations are excellent, even top notch. The 2D and 3D environment are blended together perfectly and the result is a perfect soft smoothie.\n\nThe sounds and music are the most amazing part of the game. They are so perfectly remade. The SFX were brought into the future but they still have the nostalgic feel. It is the same with music. The music might even be funkier than ever. Some themes had slightly unnecessary wub wub but mostly they're as glorious and magical as in the old DuckTales. On top of all this, the whole thing is fully voice acted and it is marvelous.\n\nDuckTales: Remastered is worth every cent. I'm a hardcore FPS gamer and terrible at platformers but DuckTales: Remastered was really easy to pick up. It's all in all an excellent and hilarious game. I have no complaints.

I loved and played the original NES version many, many times.  Sadly, that version is still superior.  The only thing the new version does is add TONS of annoying and unskippable dilagoue that is corny, cliché, and predictable. The controls are pretty awful on a keyboard and they change the plot, tweak the music, and the cutscenes (which there are far too many of) are agonizing to watch.   Their idea of replay value is having you buy pictures of the original art and awful concept art sketches with the money you earn in game.  These sketches could be done on a napkin or wet toilet paper.  It's horrible.  The last level is frustratingly difficult and you thankfully have infinite lives but it's still annoying.  Also, it is NOT a direct remake. They changed the graphics, various levels, how you warp back to translyvania etc. and also changed every end boss.  This game is unspectacular enough to fail to wow new converts with the simple gameplay and the massive amount of corny cutscenes is sure to annoy the target audience gamer that is now 30ish and played this back in the day.  Remember the Amazon level?  Well, it's almost the same except now have have to Pause 8 different times for an annoying cutscene that you cannot skip where scrooge rips on the helicopter pilot in obvious and cheesy ways.

Of course, this all would be for naught if the gameplay wasn't up to snuff.

The music, gameplay, bosses, enemies, characters, treasure, loot, gems, the Moon, and everything that made the NES game great is in Ducktales: Remastered.

The biggest changes are in the beginning and in the end of the game where they added some stuff (sorry, no spoilers).\n\nGameplay\n*Gameplay is fluid and controls almost exactly like the original. You control Scrooge McDuck who attacks by jumping on enemies with his cane. When he lands on the ground or on an enemy with his cane, he bounces off, causing him to continually bounce in a pogo-like fashion for as long as you hold the button down.\n*Most beginning parts of levels are very similar to the originals, but the later parts are extended and have added sections for longer play.\n*You start off with the option of beginner or medium difficulty and unlock harder difficulties as you progress.\n*The 2D hand-drawn sprites are beautiful as well as the 3D modeling for the stages. Original Disney artists Mike Peraza and Rick Evans drew the backgrounds.\n*Even the steam achievements are well placed and add a depth of challenge to the game.\n\nMusic\nOnce you beat the game for your first time, you have the option to switch between the awesome remixed versions (default) or the original NES soundtrack! What more could you ask for!?\n\nStory\n*The plot is somewhat basic but features most of the Ducktales cast you know and love.\n*Voice actors - Alan Young is still the voice of Scrooge! He's ninety-four years old! The characters Duckworth, Launchpad, and Magica De Spell are all voiced by the original cast.\n*If you didn't come for story, cutscenes are skippable.\n\n\nSo... "Did they deliver?" My answer would have to be, "Oh yes they did!"

So there was very high expectations from Capcom when a game was announced for the NES and they delivered beyond expectations.  This remastered version captures the same outstanding gameplay as the original but with added bonuses for the nostalgic.  Story and cuts scenes have been added and feature a lot of the original cast and everything, from the way the characters act to the scenarios, feel like it's from the 80's cartoon.\n\nI do have a few cons to the game though.  Everytime you play a stage you have to go through the cut scenes and while they can be skipped they are tedious.  Furthermore, once you are familiar with the stages the game is incredibly easy aside from the very last part that takes a dramatic jump in difficulty and ups the frustration level.\n\nSo my recommendation, if you love the original game then get this and enjoy the magic of ducktales once again.","September 24, 2014","true","9.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I did however play it on the Gameboy, where I was terrible at it, but loved playing it all the same. I watched the Disney afternoon religiously, (except for Talespin, never really got into that as a kid.)\nWhen I bumped into this game, I knew I had to try it, for nostalgias sake.\n\nThe graphics are beautifully hand drawn, the backgrounds look amazing and the remixes of the themes are awesome. The thing that amazed me the most was the fact that they got the entire original voice cast back together, including Alan Young ( 91 at the time of making the game,) and June Foray (a whopping 94).\nTheir participation to me is an amazing gesture of love towards the original fans of the show. In fact, from time to time it actually feels like you are playing a lost episode of Ducktales.\n\nUnfortunately, the developers got so excited by this that they decided to cram a 1 minute cut scene into what feels like every 2 minutes of gameplay, (especially in the Amazon level) which interrupts the play flow. These scenes can be skipped, which is a blessing on the second play through. Less would definitely have been more here.\nThe gameplay is as fun as I remember and the unlockable extras are an incentive to play through numerous times. Although I wish, they were not tiered. I would have preferred to unlock the soundtrack first thing before background sketches, but this is also a minor gripe.\n\nThe controls are a little iffy on the pogo jump at times, but feel right on most of the time. The difficulty is low and consistent, except for in the last level where it spikes up to a “throw-your-controller-across-the-room” hard that the rest of the game did not prepare you for.\n\nOverall, whether or not you enjoy this game will depend on your expectations going in. if you expect an old-school game trip down memory lane you won’t be disappointed, especially if you can find it on sale.\n\nPros:\n-	Lovingly made, beautiful  remake of a classic\n-	Fun Gameplay of the original\n\nCons:\n-	Slight control issues\n-	Inconsistent difficulty on the last level\n","January 8, 2014","true","5.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/espresso651/recommended/237630/","espresso651","Espresso","http://steamcommunity.com/id/espresso651/","281 products in account","Long ago, in the dark ages, I rented a video game based on a Disney TV show that frustrated me.  It was hard to get the controls right, and it was very challenging.  But I played it more, learned how the pogo jump worked, and rented it again, then owned a copy.  There were a lot of NES games, but this one lodged itself into my brain with a love and hate.  So of course, it's wonderful that Capcom has decided to revisit Duckburg again, not with yet-another-reboot, but a remaster of the original game.  And this time, they really brought out some of the old shine.\n\nFor those who weren't around back then, Duck Tales was an animated series in the late-80's that focused on Donald Duck's three nephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie living with their other uncle, a Scottish billionaire named Scrooge McDuck, who took them around the world on adventures seeking rare treasures.  It was crazy, absurd, cliched, and typical Disney fun, and I've got fond memories of the show.\n\nThe game follows the same premise.  Scrooge is travelling around the world (and the Moon) looking for five of the rarest treasures.  Many of the recurring characters from the show find their way into the game, the nephews and Webbigail, Ms. Beakley, The Beagle Boys, and of course, Magica De Spell.\n\nWhile a few changes have been made to the game's levels and menus, the underlaying mechanics are unchanged.  The graphics, however, are far from NES.  The game has been completely reinvisioned in both graphics and sound, and it resembles (and surpasses) the original series it was based on visually.  This game looks great.  Musically, the sound in the NES version was always good, but it has been rewritten and improved entirely.  It's kind of a thrill to hear the old sounds coming out underneath the new recordings, it's there, but it's like you've never heard it before.\n\nOne welcome change was the addition of new cutscenes featuring the original Duck Tales voice cast.\n\nMuch of the challenge has always been learning to use Scrooge's only weapon, his cane.  The remastered version contains an "easy pogo" mode, which I have not tried.  Mastering Scrooge's two main moves is the key to the game, and even then, the game is a challenge.\n\nThis game is of course a Capcom platformer, meaning many of the same pitfalls and traps you could expect in an early Mega Man game are here.  Endless waves of apes jumping over obstacles, stalactites falling from the ceiling, floors falling from underneath, as well as some other interest ideas that would be found in other games, like riding in a mine cart.  And at the end of each level, the boss fights have been completely reinvisioned.  The bosses are bigger, tougher, and scarier than before.\n\nSo what you get is a classic, pretty hard NES game, For those who played the original game, or grew up watching the late 80's/early 90's Disney shows like Duck Tales and Rescue Rangers, this is going to feel really nice.  I'm not sure younger gamers will fully appreciate a show that's been off the air so long and a game with old school difficulty (not Contra-difficulty, though).  But personally, I'm really enjoying going back to Duckberg, and I've got the theme song stuck in my head again.\n\nLife is like a hurricane, here in Duckburg...","January 9, 2014","true","23.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Seriously though, this remake is bright and vibrant compared to the original NES game. The gameplay is not too difficult (no matter what others may say) and there are a few issues here and there.\n\nFor example, others complain about the cane pogo stick not working at times. I find that the times that the cane pogo stick doesn't work is when you are close to an edge. Not all edges mind you, just most of them. In one of my videos, you can see where I hit a block and destroyed it and the block above it did not fall down. Okay, okay. Maybe that is just one of the NES game's quirks. However, then I swing my cane at the empty space below the floating block and then it comes falling down?\n\nDoesn't really make sense, but hey it's a game about a bazillionaire talking duck... so there's that.\n\nBasically, pick this game up. It's great gameplay and fun colors are more amusing than strangling a Webby duck.\n\nPS: The original voice of Scrooge McDuck does the voice here as well.

Who wouldn't want to swim in a vault full of treasure?  Never played the NES version so I can't say if this version is easier or harder my guess would be easier since older games are typically more challenging.  The visuals look great and the music is quite catchy, you even have the option to play the original 8 bit music.  It was a little challenging at first but after a few playthroughs it wasn't too tough of a platformer.  I love the fact that they had the original voice actors who were still alive to do this, and it is quite a roster of cartoon legends.    So basically if you have any good memories of Scrooge McDuck and his pals it is definitely worth the 15 bucks.  For people who have no connection with it, you should wait for a sale since there really isn't much to do beyond playing the game on different difficulty levels.  One straight playthrough took me an hour and a half and that was with finding treasures/extra lives.  Overall an average platformer without the nostalgia factor, a must buy for those who's childhood involved the richest duck in Duckburg.\n\n7/10","January 16, 2014","true","14.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So is it still anything special by today's standards? Not really. It's a very basic platformer. But still, what it does, it does very well. And being based off the DuckTales TV show, it turns out to be a pretty cute little game (and I do mean little; it's a very short game). The original had little to no plot, but they came up with a completely new story to tie all the levels together and features several of the characters from the show (my only real issue with the story is that at times Scrooge seems to be a bit more of a jerk than he was on the show). Some reviewers who played the original thought the emphasis on story was a downpoint, but for me that may have been my favorite part. Without it, it's just a generic, if pretty fun platformer. Plus, these days it's getting harder and harder than ever to find someone who wants to make something that's just nice, like a video game that doesn't have bloodletting or edginess to it (ironically, if more people were to make games like this they would be the ones being "edgy"). So, ultimately, I'd say DuckTales is a game worth playing, and a kind of game I'd like to see more often.","January 14, 2014","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game is a remaster of the NES game DuckTales, with a beautiful new stylised look in HD. Not only that, but it has new modern remixes of the older tunes which sound great. The new cutscenes that were added have full voice acting by the original cast, which is an impressive feat in itself. Alan Young as Scrooge McDuck is still as good as always, and it's a joy to hear his voice acting.\n\nThe gameplay itself is exactly the same as the original NES game, which isn't a bad thing. The controls are solid and never feel unresponsive. The game itself feels like a new game, especially to somebody like me with no experience of the original. I found myself loving every moment, and I really connected with the characters and the world they existed in, despite having no experience of DuckTales previously.\n\nMy only gripe is the game's length. Despite the new level at the start of the game, the main story is only 2.5 hours long. The good thing is that you can choose to unlock all sorts of concept art and sketches for the game using the money you gain by playing the levels. Replaying levels never gets old, and there's an option to turn off cutscenes automatically if you want to just play the game, and also an option to have the original 8-bit music in the levels. I feel like I'll get many more hours out of the game just for the fun of playing the game.\n\nIf you're a fan of the DuckTales TV show, or the video game, you must get the game now. If you've had no experience with it before, but are interested, I recommend that you wait for a sale and pick it up then, as the length may not be enough to satisfy.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/topologic/recommended/237630/","topologic","Topology","http://steamcommunity.com/id/topologic/","153 products in account","This review is mostly aimed at those who enjoyed the DuckTales NES game and cartoon, as I did, because I won't be able to objectively divorce my review from my nostalgic love of this game.\n\nScore: 9/10\n\nThis game was made for us.  And, by us, I mean we people who grew up with DuckTales, both the original game(s) and cartoon, both.  I really don't think there are words for how gratifying it is to see the adventures of Scrooge in all the remastered glory that this reimagining of a timeless classic has managed to provide, but I'm going to give it a shot.\n\nFirst, the graphics.  Not every game should strive for photorealism, and DuckTales is a perfect example of one such game.  As a licensed game depicting a cartoon, I have almost zero complaints about WayForward's presentation here.  It truly feels like you're both watching the cartoon adaptation of the game, while still being very involved in its progression, as the player.  Backgrounds are beautiful, and while mostly static, they do an excellent job of immersing the player in the cartoon world in which the characters reside.  Animations are fluid, sprites are beautiful, and everything looks familiar, and yet brand new.\n\nSecond, the music.  DuckTales had exceptional music even when you had to play it on the NES to get your fix, so the team that was tasked with remixing and rescoring this game really had big shoes to fill, but they didn't disappoint.  Every song is reminiscent of its 8-bit counterpart, which is to be expected of a remake.  Not all remixes are made equal, mind you, and some are clearly better than others, but that's not to say that there are any bad songs in this game (in my opinion).  Some music is so good that I had to stop to enjoy it at the start of its respective level (looking at you, Moon Theme, and Mt. Vesuvius theme).\n\nThird, the gameplay.  The gameplay is largely unchanged from the original NES game, but that's not necessarily a complaint.  Some levels are just as unforgiving as their original counterparts, but the game itself is easier in general, due to some quality-of-life changes made by WayForward.  These changes include being able to save progress in between levels, or simply being kicked back to level select upon losing all of your lives, as opposed to having to completely start over from square one.  Having something to spend your hard-earned money on is a new gameplay element as well, which may lead you to make stupid decisions in certain levels while trying to find every hidden diamond (I sure did).\n\nFourth, and possibly the most importantly, the cutscenes.  The biggest thing that WayForward added to this game is this considerable source of exposition.  When you played the original NES game, there was no backstory given or reason delineated for why Scrooge was doing what he was doing, other than greed (which is not entirely out of character).  The cutscenes provide that important missing element, which really, was the only thing that I found wanting about the original DuckTales.  The voicework is wonderful.  The incomparable Alan Young, who is well into his nineties now, does a masterful job of reprising his role as Scrooge McDuck, and much of the original cast also returns to bring life to this amazing game.  Perhaps the most important detail about the cutscenes, though, is that they're entirely optional.  This stops them from getting stale for those of us that plan on playing this game several times over.\n\nScrooge, Huey, Dewey, Louie, Webby, Mrs. Beakley, Launchpad, Bubba, Gyro, Fenton, the Beagle Boys, Flintheart Glomgold, and Magica De Spell are waiting to greet you once again.

Plenty of decent reviews out there, so I'll limit mine to bulleted pros/cons that really stood out for me:\nPros:\n-Devs stayed true to the exceptional controls, music, and level design of the original game, and with a facelift that made it look like the cartoon show, it was doubly nostalgic for me. Loved the voice acting.\n-The two additional stages from the original game - the Money Bin and Vesuvius - are fun, though the latter far more so than the former. Especially where Vesuvius was concerned though, I wanted more.\n-Boss battles were all great fun.\n-You can swim in the Money Bin. Not the game's strongest point, but I've wanted to be able to do that since I got the original game when I was 10.\nCons:\n-I really would have liked more or different stages. I would hope that if this game is a financial success, that they'd consider making another with more original level designs.\n-Cutscenes. I liked the attempt at a bigger story, and that story isn't actually bad, but the cutscenes are long, boring, and with all the wonders they did with the graphics, it would have been nice to seem more gestures, lips moving, etc.\n-At an MSRP of $15, it's a little too short, especially since much of the game is material many of us have played before. Might be worth it if you're a big fan, but for the casual platform fan, I'd wait for sales.\n\nOverall, it's worth a look if you're either a huge DuckTales fan, or if it's on sale, looking for a fun game to spend a weekend with.\n","January 12, 2014","true","10.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game is a remaster of the NES game DuckTales, with a beautiful new stylised look in HD. Not only that, but it has new modern remixes of the older tunes which sound great. The new cutscenes that were added have full voice acting by the original cast, which is an impressive feat in itself. Alan Young as Scrooge McDuck is still as good as always, and it's a joy to hear his voice acting.\n\nThe gameplay itself is exactly the same as the original NES game, which isn't a bad thing. The controls are solid and never feel unresponsive. The game itself feels like a new game, especially to somebody like me with no experience of the original. I found myself loving every moment, and I really connected with the characters and the world they existed in, despite having no experience of DuckTales previously.\n\nMy only gripe is the game's length. Despite the new level at the start of the game, the main story is only 2.5 hours long. The good thing is that you can choose to unlock all sorts of concept art and sketches for the game using the money you gain by playing the levels. Replaying levels never gets old, and there's an option to turn off cutscenes automatically if you want to just play the game, and also an option to have the original 8-bit music in the levels. I feel like I'll get many more hours out of the game just for the fun of playing the game.\n\nIf you're a fan of the DuckTales TV show, or the video game, you must get the game now. If you've had no experience with it before, but are interested, I recommend that you wait for a sale and pick it up then, as the length may not be enough to satisfy. Personally, I'm glad to have the game in my library.","December 26, 2013","true","7.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Dear god, the music! I was afraid they'd risk ruining the old amazing soundtrack but, no, they improved on it! I really love all the reworked songs I've heard so far and I've played all levels except Himalaya =)\n\nIf you loved the old NES game or if you want an old school hard platformer in a flashy new suit then grab this game!\n\n9/10 - Would give a 10 but I game overed on bosses so many times that I feel I need to get back on the game somehow xD","August 13, 2013","true","5.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

While the game is easy on a keyboard, I recommend playing the game with the controller, especially if you have "hard pogo" option where you have to press down and action button.\n\nIt has small reply value and $15 is "steep" of a price since you can beat the game under an hour, but I bought it as soon as it came out and its worth every bit of it. :) If there is a price reduction, especially if it is 50% off, I highly recommend you buy it!","May 29, 2014","true","11.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In a sentence: gaming has moved on since the original release and this re-mastered version is stubbornly refusing to.\n\nFirst up, I loved the music of the original and really enjoyed the game as a kid. I remember it being a bit frustrating back then like so many games from that era(Ghostbusters on Nintendo to this day defeats me). Nevertheless I assumed (as it turns out, wrongly) that I must have found it difficult because of my age and lack of experience and I would be able to tackle this remastered version without too much difficulty. I couldn’t have been more wrong. Although the game looks and sounds great (and it really sounds great), the hit detection on enemies and the environmental objects is a little off which can make a big difference. The levels are gorgeous to look at, with Transylvania Castle being a standout however, the actual design is not polished in the way modern platformers like Super Meat Boy, or even Rayman, are.\n\nAll too often enemies are positioned such that you can only kill them by taking a hit yourself, a concession the game itself seems to recognise. Almost immediately after you encounter such poorly placed enemies there is a health pick-up. It’s as though the game is saying “yeah, we know that is a moronic place to put that enemy, so here, have some cake by way of an apology.” Except that doesn’t work when you only have room to take one more hit. You never get the cake, you only get frustrated. You can vary the height of your jump but when you use the pogo jump the method of controlling that height is just too inconsistent.\n\nTo add to this frustration, the game sticks rigidly to its old school roots. This means you can only take so many hits before you die and only so many deaths before it is game over. When it’s game over you are sent back to the level select screen to start over. No checkpoint continues here, oh no. Back you go to the menu to select that level again. This is a truly baffling design choice. Sending you back to the level select instead of letting you simply restart the level only adds to the pent up frustration.\n\nEach level can take 20-30 minutes and when you are replaying the same level over and over, only to get to the boss, die and have to play through another 20 minutes to get back to the boss only to die again, it becomes very grating very quickly.\n\nThen end level deserves a special mention. When you think you have completed the game there is an after-boss section which will push you to the brink. Its inclusion seems totally needless and when you sit through the end of game credits to read of how many game testers and QA people were involved in this product it simply boggles the mind that they decided to leave this in. 6 hours of my life I will not get back.\n\nI started it so I finished it, and if nothing else, the look and sound of the game kept bringing me back which counts for something. The original voice cast is a nice touch as is the added in-game concept art etc.\n\nWhy do I recommend it? Well if you played the original you will mostly like this re-master. If you didn't play the original I would say try this out with my comments in mind. It is not a terrible game by any stretch and it will bring a smile to your face, but it is not a top tier platform game and as you play through it you will come to appreciate just how far platform games have come.","July 11, 2014","true","11.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm not sure what it is, but something was lost in the translation; it just doesn't have the same charm that the original game had for the NES. But without comparing this game to the original, it's still an enjoyable experience. But how could I not compare this to the original? It's arguably one of the greatest games for the original Nintendo console, and tons of people, myself included, hold it near and dear to their hearts. So it's nearly impossible not to compare this 'updated' version to the original game that came out almost three decades ago.\n\nOne of the biggest reasons this game doesn't have the same charm as the original, at  least for me, is the soundtrack. I know some people think they did a great job with it, and maybe they did, but most of the new versions of these beloved songs are just awful, and at times barely even recognizable. I would have been much happier with this game if they had just re-released the same game with the same music and just updated the textures, but whatever, it's not the worst thing ever. And I'm not sure if they went ahead and made some of these levels longer, but the levels feel longer, and sometimes for no reason at all other than to extend the time of play. And lastly, the cut-scenes; these initially made me dislike the game greatly as there are far too many of them, but once you realize you can skip them, they're not so bad.\n\nOverall, this game is good, but it could have been much better. If you've never played the original than you will probably like it more than I did. It's got everything you want in a solid title; the controls are tight, the graphics are crisp and look great in high resolution, it works perfectly with a controller, and the voice acting is very well done.","February 27, 2015","true","3.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Capcom said if this game will be a success they will continue to remake other long gone disney games, including my most favorite, Aladdin, that I used to play on SNES like 19 years ago. And sure DuckTales: Remastered is successful, alright.\n\nI barely ran into any bugs, though. The game is pretty hard, despite dodging the traps and enemies is devastating at some parts. The amount of secrets and challenge in this game is high. Collect diamonds to earn money and unlock from art gallery to soundtracks. The soundtrack is just great, especially the final level before fighting the boss. Some of it is a lot like Megaman, though.\n\nI really recommend this to get started and be prepared for the next\nremastered disney games that are on their way to empty our wallets.","January 10, 2015","true","14.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Although I've played DuckTales 2 on the NES as a kid, I've never played the original version of its sequel. So even though nostalgia wasn't a big part of it, I'm glad to report I still find this game entertaining (and even challenging at times). However, I do have a couple of complaints:\n\n1. The 2D character sprites look great but they do not fit in well with the rest of the art (backgrounds, chests, gems, etc.), which is unfortunately 3D. IMO, they should've kept everything in the iconic cartoon style of the Donald Duck universe. This is by far my biggest gripe with the game.\n\n2. At the time of writing, I'm aware of two major bugs:\n(a) The level is not reset when you respawn. Hence, the baddies will continue doing whatever they were up to when you lost your previous life. This is unfortunate, as it means that losing your first hit point may be unavoidable. And while bosses do indeed respawn, their effects do not (e.g., if you die at the wrong time during the fight with the boss in the Amazon, the ground might still be shaking from when it slammed into it before).\n(b) Lots of people report that the game crashes for them when they reach the final boss. I don't know whether it will be the case for me as well but I thought I'd give you a heads up.\n\n3. Even though they were probably never a part of the original version, they should've added special-case animations for talking characters. It's a little silly to see them talk with their mouths closed.\n\nThat said, I'm hoping for a remastered version of DuckTales 2.\n\nCheers,\nBogdan","December 17, 2015","true","11.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The music, of course, has been redone and for the most part I think they did it well. The Himalayas have screeching guitars now, because if anything says the Himalayas, it's distorted guitar leads.\n\nThe Moon I was slightly let down by since it's such an iconic tune in video game music, I figured they'd go all out on it. It's a great version of it, but I just wanted more. NOTE: The end credits has a piano version so hell yeah!\n\nThey added a bunch of story to this game, being the old fart that I am though, I had no interest in why Scrooge McDuck is on the moon looking for whatever the hell it is he's looking for. I just want to bounce on my cane and collect gems.\n\nI did not encounter the gamebreaking bug so many people seem to have gotten, so I can't say anything based on that.\n\nAll in all I think it's a good remake.

Its been 2 years and the developers have no interest to fix a bug.\n\nIf you check the support forums there is a ton of comments of all the freezing that goes on in the game.

As its a game bug that prevents from finishing it.\n\nThe game freezes everytime I reach the part with the red curtains (boss' lair?) It freezes after I enter this area with a random timing (sometimes I can see scrooge freezed as he enters, sometimes he can't even appear). I'm on Windows 7, x64, Nvidia Geforce GT 555M.\n\nI have heard that if you upgrade to windows 10 that the issue doesn't occur.

CONTAINS SPOILERS!\n\nMy old review of this game was short and flawed, and now that i've replayed it, i decided to make a better review.\n\nDucktales Remastered is a remake of the Ducktales NES game, made by Capcom and released in 1990. The game is fondly remembered, and for good reasons. The music is great, the level design is good, and most importantly, it had great gameplay. Now, does the remake justify the original, or is it just a failure? Let's see.\n\nStory: The story is the same as the original NES game, but it has been expanded, for the better. For example, in the original game, on the moon level, Scrooge McDuck could appareantly survive just fine without a suit. In Remastered, it's finally explained, he chews oxygen flavoured taffy. Not to mention the final level has been changed from Transylvania to Mount Vesuvius in Italy, Magicka's home. Overall, the story fits the game perfectly. 9/10.\n\nGraphics: The graphics are well-made as well. You could say the game is 2.5D, the characters are drawn in 2D, but the levels are drawn in 3D (but can only be traversed in 2D). Overall, WayForward and Capcom did a great job at the graphics. 10/10.\n\nGameplay: The gameplay is largely the same as the NES game, with a few changes. The pogo jumo is now easier to perform, but you can change it to the same way it's performed in the original game (hard pogo in the settings). Overall, the gameplay is solid and fun. 9/10.\n\nMusic: The music has, of course been remixed for the remake. And the composer have done an excellent job at the music, every track feels nostalgic and new at the same time. Not to mention, in case you're really nostalgic, yu can unlock the option of replacing the remixed soundtrack with the 8-bit versions of the tracks (you have to beat the game ocne first though). 10/10.\n\nIn conclusion, Ducktales Remastered makes the original NES game justice. It's by no means the best video game remake i've played in my life, but it deserves a spot on the shelf (or your steam library).\n\nWritten by Littlefoot, the gaming dinosaur.","February 8, 2015","true","15.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","3","5","2","3"

I never played the NES game, meaning I wasn't hooked on the nostalgia, and I never watched the show, so I had to look up a lot of the stuff here.  Much like the NES game, I often get a flickering effect with the characters as their sprites appear and disappear whenever a certain number of details are on-screen.  On top of that, there's the lag.  Oh sweet lord, the lag.  I haven't had a game run at 2 FPS since I tried playing TF2 at max settings.  As far as sound goes, I think the guys at WayForward did a decent job modernizing the songs from the original, except at the title screen.  As far as I could tell, the basic gameplay was faithful to the original, but as I mentioned before, it got really laggy.  Oh, and did I mention that it no longer works on my pc, thanks to a game-breaking glitch that crashes the game randomly during boss battles and whenever I leave the pause menu?  Wasn't worth the $14.99 just got a glitchy nostalgia-fest.  If you're into "remastered" games that try to be nostalgic for nostalgia's sake, then you'll love this.  Lord knows I didn't.\n\nP.S.: I have nothing against WayForward, I just don't like this game.","April 18, 2015","false","1.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I particularly liked the "pogo" mechanic which allowed you to bounce of objects and reach otherwise inaccessible places.\n\nI have two main complaints about the game however - one is that the cutscenes are very long, very frequent, and despite featuring the original voice cast of the TV show, the voice acting is annoying. I found myself skipping through most of the cutscenes because I couldn't take the voice acting anymore.\n\nThe other (more minor) complaint is that the game was quite short for its $14.99 price tag, working out to $2.49 per level. I got the game on sale, so not a big deal, but had I paid full price for the game, I would have been unsatisfied with the amount of content.\n\nRating: 75%","August 12, 2014","true","3.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

This was one of my favorite NES games when i was a child. At the time the cartoon was very popular over here in Sweden so there was no surprise that even the game did well.\n\nI was a bit worried at first when i saw that they were making a HD remake of a childhood memory. The first videos i saw made me go in to a nerdrage over how soulless the game seemed to be. It honestly looked like a crappy flashversion of my favorite game. But when i saw it for a good price on GMG i had to have it in my collection, just so i could say i hated it, which i diden't.\n\nThis is a really really good remake of the classic game. The graphics, even if they were very different from the original, still felt really good. The controls were spot on as with the original and the music, oh my god the music. It is said that you dont mess with the classics, but the composers handled the original soundtrack with the outmost respect and made new classics of them.\n\nThe new additions in gameplay also worked pretty well. They had to redesign some of the levels and for the most part it worked preetty good. The only downside is the mandatory tutorial level in the very beginning of the game. It's irritating when you are trying to beat the game for a second or third time, or when achivement hunting.\n\nBut overall this ia a great game. They really gave the respect needed for such a classic game and made our old gamer hearts fill with a warm feeling of nostalgia.","December 3, 2013","true","9.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chrisby/recommended/237630/","chrisby","chris.by","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chrisby/","152 products in account","Good and entertaining remake of a classic with some inherited and some added flaws.\n\nThe remastered DuckTales music draws you right into the game and you are eager to "press start", though you might encounter the first hurdle here, if you don't have a supported (read an Xbox360) controller. (Installing a utility like x360ce or xPadder helps, the keyboard is also an option on the PC of course.)\n\nThe graphics are great, especially the animated sprites and while some reviewers criticized the comparably small number of different animations, especially noticeable in the cutscenes, I think it's fine for the scope of the project. Talking about the cutscenes, I consider them an added flaw, they are too frequent, interrupt the gameplay unnecessarily and require two button presses to skip them. No need to borrow the weak way of storytelling of a modern FPS in a classic. The voice acting is well done and the cast is mostly from the original TV show.\n\nI like the new 3D backgrounds as well, and I don't see why some reviewers think they wouldn't match with the sprites. The environments are clearly readable, which is important in a game like this.\n\nThe uneven difficulty can be considered an inherited flaw, the levels vary greatly in difficulty, and the first on the list, Amazonas, surely isn't the easiest. When you play the game on "Easy" it's not too much of a problem, because you have infinite lives (making the mode arguably "Very Easy"), but beginning on "Normal", it can become frustrating, because if you run out of lives, you have to restart the whole level, all treasure gone. Though if I remember how many times I smashed my NES controller onto the floor, this remake is true to its roots in this aspect.\n\nThe game is also really short and most of the playtime can be attributed to the overall unforgiving difficulty once you play on "Normal", "Hard" or the unlockable "Extreme" setting. Gameplay wise, the biggest addition compared to the original is a tutorial level at the beginning.\n\nDuckTales is easy to recommend, not only for the nostalgia, but because it's a very good game for the price. Sure, the cutscenes, will annoy you and the difficulty mixed with occasional hick-ups in the controls will frustrate you from time to time, but hasn't it been like this also 2 decades ago?\n\nNext stop, Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers, WayForward?","January 5, 2014","true","9.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I particularly liked the "pogo" mechanic which allowed you to bounce of objects and reach otherwise inaccessible places.\n\nI have two main complaints about the game however - one is that the cutscenes are very long, very frequent, and despite featuring the original voice cast of the TV show, the voice acting is annoying. I found myself skipping through most of the cutscenes because I couldn't take the voice acting anymore.\n\nThe other (more minor) complaint is that the game was quite short for its $14.99 price tag, working out to $2.49 per level. I got the game on sale, so not a big deal, but had I paid full price for the game, I would have been unsatisfied with the amount of content.\n\nRating: 75%","August 12, 2014","true","3.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

There is alot of changes in this game.  The story is more fleshed out in a good way, it almost feels like a long lost Ducktales cartoon episode (with faithful voice acting included.) Its been awhile since I've played the NES DuckTales, but I swear the level design on some of the levels have changed as well, with even some added new levels at the beginning of the game and somewhat at the end.  I will say that the controls don't feel near as tight as the old verison, but not bad enough to not recommend the game.  One thing they did nail is music. MAN did they do a good job with the updated tunes, especially with the Moon stage and Boss music!

You know, the classic Disney show we all remember with the addicting theme song you can never seem to get out of your head. It is a remake of the original DuckTales NES game, a game from a time where games based on Disney property triumphed. DuckTales was highly regarded as one of the NES' best platformers, up there with the big names like Mega Man and Super Mario - and for good reason. Great controls, great atmosphere, amazing soundtrack, a simple story based on characters everybody knows and loves - everything you needed to form the perfect video game. DuckTales Remastered by WayForward seeks to recreate the fun that we had with DuckTales in the 80s for the modern gamer, and it does an outstanding job. Each little detail is recreated with love and care, the animations are solid and faithful to the character, the soundtrack's remixes are just as good as the original - if not better, solid gameplay and controls, new fully voiced cutscenes featuring the original Scrooge McDuck voice actor, and a lot more. The only downside to the game is that it is very short, but this was the standard for NES games. However, if you're planning to 100% the game by getting all achievements, you'll find that replayability has increased greatly as mastering the levels on Expert difficulty will, likely, take you a very long time. All in all, I highly recccommend this title. It is a great platformer that everybody deserves to experience. If you were a fan of the NES original, or if you're a newcomer, everyone can enjoy this game.","December 30, 2015","true","11.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

In Ducktales Remastered you play as Scrooge Mcduckand one day the Beagle boys raid your mansion for a treasure map which leads to all kinds of treasure so you gotta go and find all the treasure. The game is played like a metroidvania type game where you can explore the level all you like with platforming mixed into the mix. As the Remastered says in the title its a remake of the classic Nes version. The update is worth while. It has charming visuals which and fantastic music to go along with it. The game plays great and it is one of the best game out there. But like every game it has a few problems that make the game pretty hard to play. A few glitches can be found that make you stuck in the platforms. The game also has some pretty hard platforming sections and it you need to have plan a perfect jump or you will plumit to youre doom. But the game is pretty solid. It has a charming style which you cant deny and fun levels and overall the fans of DuckTales will simply love this game.

The only music which wasn't so good was the Himalaya theme because they added too much stuff to it with different new rythm and meldoies which completely hide the original melody and make it sound like it's 2 musics in one.\n\nThe game has the 5 original stages but re-vamped with new areas to make them longer as well as a new intro and final stage. The new intro stage hardly matters though because it's very short and straightforward.\nGameplay is perfect Duck Tales fun and I liked how they kept the pogo mechanic from DT2 (you don't have to press Down to perform a pogo jump).\n\nThe cutscenes are no problem. On the contrary they share the Duck Tales sprite, they're even funny at times and it's a pleasure to hear the original voice actors.\nYou can skip them all anyway if they really bother you.\nThe only cutscenes which bothered me a little was in the Amazon stage because you have to pick 8 different items throughout the stage and there is a small cutscene for each of them which is a bit too much (but again, you can skip that).\n\nIn-game play time said 2h45 after I beat it but it actually took me around 4hours. The relative shortness is justified by the low price.\nAlso there is tons of cool artwork to unlock if you want to 100% the game which is very rewarding (if you look at Wario Land Shake Dimension, a very comparable game, beating the game 100% wasn't rewarding at all).\n\nThis game is everything we'd hope for a remake.\nBut that's the only problem for me: I wouldn't have wanted a remake of DT1. I would have prefered a remake of DT2, or even better, a whole new DT game. I guess I'll have to content myself with the couple of DT2 references thrown in...","August 13, 2013","true","16.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PresidentSkele/recommended/237630/","PresidentSkele","Green Skeleton","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PresidentSkele/","1181 products in account","This review was going to be about how I had never played the original Ducktales and how this game made me love losing, instead, I have to talk about the technical deficiencies of one of the best platformers I've ever played.\n\nWhen I first started the game, it had ludicrously bad framerate. I didn't understand at first. It looks like a 2D flash game for god sakes. I tried lowering the resolution, tried turning off the anti aliasing.\n\nNothing.\n\nTurns out in some weird form of programming, the game is tied to your desktop. Specifically the AERO theme. I had it disabled on my copy of Windows 7 64bit, and this drastically affected the game as a result. Turning it back on was no big deal and the game ran at the framerate I expected in the first place.\n\nIf only that was the end of it.\n\nThe finale of the game (which is rightfully the trickiest part of the game) ends with two big middle fingers. First, the final boss will crash the game. Imagine going through that hell of a stage, seeing the finish line and having it cut short thanks to shoddy programming. The way to fix it of course if you're on a multicore is to start up task manager and setting the affinity of the game to 1 core. With that done... the game still crashes.\n\nYes, even after all that, the game still crashes. After you defeat the boss, his death cutscene will for some reason, crash the game. I don't know why. I really don't. I had to resort to skipping the cutscene to prevent it.\n\nImagine not only having finally beaten the boss, but for it to also crash right after, and that's still not the other middle finger.\n\nRight after that hard stage and that hard boss, you're thrown into TWO instant death scenarios.\n\nSo imagine on the Hard difficulty, you defeat the final boss without getting hit once and have 3 lives left, only to lose them all to some of the cheapest, "gotchya" moments ever. Mega Man X3 had a similar ending and it wasn't even close to as punishing as this.\n\nSo despite the game and the programming throwing every single setback they could, I still begrudgingly finished the game, cause its jumping controls are rock solid and were worth the pain. I think it says something about modern day gaming where playing a scottish duck feels more immersive than a soldier from Call of Duty or Batman in Arkham City, because what I wanted to do with my controller is actually translated on screen. I have never felt so connected with a character and how he plays in YEARS. It really doesn't take long for Scrooge to become part of your muscle memory, even for somebody who has never played the original. If there's something wrong with the way McDuck plays, I couldn't tell you, cause he felt perfect to me. He jumped how I wanted him, he pogo'd how I wanted him to. This came to ahead with some really tricky pogo jumps and having to avoid not only spikes but flying bat anemies just above you.\n\nThe one thing I can tell you that felt absolutely crowbarred in despite never playing the original, were the cutscenes. These would be pretty dreadful without the original cast, but because of them, it really elevated the stilted looking material. It's not that it's bad, it's just that I wouldn't have cared if it were the Nolan North's and Terra Strong's of the world delivering the material. Scrooge sounds a little tired but that's to be expected for the actor's age, but he does nail it here and there. Launchpad sounds exactly like Launchpad and same goes for Huey, Dewey and Louie. I should say "most" of the original cast, because a few of the actors had people had passed away since the original cartoons had aired. I actually was shocked to find that McScrooge's nemesis, Flintheart Glomgold, was not voiced by the original actor. The only one that never felt right was Fenton/Gizmoduck. He did not at all sound like I remembered, which was even worse because "blathering blatherskite" is a pretty iconic phrase in both this series and Darkwing Duck, so he really stood out.\n\nThe problem with the cutscenes beyond how terrible they look (which is an even bigger insult considering how great the original cartoon looked), is that to start up a level, fail, then have to start it up again is a pain. You have to skip about 3 cutscenes minimum, which requires you to hit start, hit A to skip, then repeat. It's just really annoying.\n\nAt the end of the day, Wayforward continues to impress me with their mercenary work, taking a lemon of a job and turning it into lemonade. In the hands of a bad studio, this really could have gone wrong in everyway. Either in an attempt to update it too much and ruining the core gameplay, or just not doing enough work and delivering a subpar port job emulation, but it's quite clear in their rushed merc work that they couldn't deliver the type of love and attention they could for the PC port that they did in the game itself, but playing as Scrooge is undeniably fun and it's hard to not recommend this game, cause you can sense the enthusiasm for this in every little hidden treasure you find.\n\nThe Pro's:\n+Rock solid controls\n\n+Devilishly difficult and rewarding to play\n\n+Good stage music remixes\n\n+A true loveletter to Ducktales fans\nThe Con's:\n-Prone to crashes\n\n-Concept art as an unlockable (Where's the NES version?)","January 19","true","5.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theyesdragon/recommended/237630/","theyesdragon","Brock Lesnar #UFC200","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theyesdragon/","31 products in account","Ahh, DuckTales: Remastered. Just as a sidenote, I never did play the first one on the SNES. But yeah, as a Disney fan and generally wanting to play light-hearted cartoon-y games a lot, I was excited for this one. Having it gifted to me, I decided to hop straight into this and found that the presentation was fantastic. The visuals are top-notch, pretty much having been remade for this HD remake of the first game, and the music even better. With a New Game option awaiting me, I decided to go for that (and picked Easy mode, mind you!) but went back to explore the other menus later; there waiting for you to pick is a Gallery of sorts, which can also be accessed via the main game's "world hub"/level selector. Options for game configuration are there and play time. That, and a leaderboard which was quite fun to look at (how do people get through the game that quickly?)\n\nAs for the actual main game itself, I loved it despite a few small flaws. The character models look brilliant and most of the time, work really well with the backgrounds. We start with a small cutscene and an opening level in the bank where you play as Scrooge McDuck (voiced by the original VA, who just so happens to be around 80, I believe) and you save Huey, Dewey and Louie from the evil (and a bit ditzy) Beagle Boys. In the process, you get to know about the main storyline; get 5 artifacts from around the world and then you'll have lots of treasure (or something like that). Woo hoo!\n\nSo what do I think of the 5 levels after this? Pretty good. All different, long and have a great boss at the end for you to tackle, all while getting to know the hilarious Launchpad, 3 boys and Webby who tag along for the ride. Although, cutscenes aren't the best (but are skippable) as they don't show the character's mouths moving when they speak. Another flaw to the game is the sometimes dodgy platforming; whether it's cheap deaths from the weird jumping mechanics or taking a bit of damage when you really feel as if it's not your fault, WayForward definitely could have improved this. It just doesn't feel as great as the Mario platformers, for example (then again, most platformers don't).\n\nSo after the next 5 levels (including THE MOOOOON, of all places. But I didn't see Princess Luna, so this is set after MLP season 3 apparently, heh heh heh), you get to save the 3 boys again and try and retrieve the treasure at Mount Vesuvius where you end up defeating Magica and also competing in some weird "escape the volcano" level that really felt bad, as sometimes Scrooge just wouldn't grab onto the ropes and wouldn't jump properly - and that kinda let that down for me, until I realised that there are a few tricks to get it right.\n\nPros:\n+ Great level variety\n+ Voice acting is top notch\n+ Art is fantastic, so is the game design\n+ Good difficulty at times\n\nCons:\n- Cutscenes aren't the best\n- Sometimes dodgy platforming\n- Length of game isn't great, despite decent replay value\n\nOverall, pretty good game. 8/10 for me. Would (get gifted, but otherwise) buy again.","November 2, 2014","true","4.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Поэтому почуствовать себя эдаким перепончатолапым Индианой Джонсом не выйдет.\n\nЧто понраивлось:\n- старый добрый геймлей: прыгаем на клюке, пинаем ящики - всё как в старые недобрые 90'ые. Даже глюки перенесли с любовью =)))\n- уровни немного изменили и расширили, добавили немного новых... сюжет тоже немного переработали.\n- музыкальные темы перезаписали, но сохранили\n- графика довольно приятная\n- изменили механику боссов - некоторые стали гораздо интереснее и сложнее\n\nЧто не понравилось:\n- убрали дополнительные сокровища... приходишь на место старого секрета, а там ничего кроме алмазов и пополнения здоровья\n- смысла в поисках секретов и зарабатывании бабла особо нет - если только открывать унылые и вряд ли кому-то нужные концепт-арты на ачивку\n- тупые детские диалоги, которые возникают по кажому поводу и без повода... Мало того, что просаживают темп игры, так ещё и сбрасываются только через меню\n- играть на клавиатуре не то чтобы прям уж очень тяжело... но, если учесть, что 75% игры проходится с зажатыми двумя кнопками, проблемы с подкючением геймпада весьма не порадовали.\n\nЕщё немного мыслей.\nНепонятно, на какую аудиторию расчитывали разработчики. Детям игра будет вряд ли интересна, потому что и "Утиные истории" для них уже не актуальны, и проектов по-лучше хватает. Если на взрослую аудиторию, на зачем было делать её НАСТОЛЬКО детской? Диалоги примитивны (о том, что они вообще не нужны уже писалось) и шутки тупы даже для детей... Сгодятся разве что совсем для трёхлетних. На настольгии игра тоже играет весьма частично. С одной стороны знакомые уровни, знакомая механика... но всё какое-то чужое (нет, не вырос, запущенная под эмулятором игра по-прежнему доставляет).\n\nИтого, брать или нет. Я рекомендую купить. Как минимум в надежде на то, что игра окупится и разработчики примутся за ремейк второй части.","August 15, 2013","true","4.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's the same hop and bop adventure you remember back then, only bigger and better. As for what this game may offer those not familiar with those older games or DuckTales itself, beyond the simple joys (I mean VERY simple) of hopping and bopping enemies and collecting treasures for a larger score, it may be best to wait for a sale.\n\nWhile DuckTales Remastered offers a solid recreation of the original game and is genuinely fun if you're up for something simple, the project just doesn't feel like WayForward went quite far enough in trying to make the project truly shine in the same ways that GRiN's Bionic Commando: Re-Armed succeeded. I won't call it lazy, because there's a clear love of the material here with the sprite work, reworked soundtrack, and tracking down all the original voice actors and actresses. At the same time, it does feel like the game had a lack of ambition, time, funds, or all of the above.","September 23, 2013","true","5.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I played the first one as a kid on the NES, and beat it plenty of times as a rental. there were some parts of the level design in a couple of areas that could have been better, but overall the game is pretty good and as fun as the original. the main issue was the frequent dialogue, lol. I liked it, it just happened a little frequently. There are challenges and leaderboards for the difficulty, loot gathered, and speed runs.  so there is quite a bit of replayability for people in those areas. as a 30-something that played the original as a child, I feel that this is one of the better remakes of classic games.  it's on sale for 50% off, and may have an 80% off day during the sale, so I figured I'd post this in case anyone was on the fence about it.

Fast forward decades later, Capcom hasremade the game.\n\nI stress, this is a remake, and not a "remaster" as it says. HOWEVER, it goes completely in stride, and takes advantage of today's technology. The dialogue and voice acting is fantastic. The original is very well represented in this game, with so much extra when you do not consider thenew graphics, music, voice acting, and dialogue. I am talking about some bonus content, including a begining level not included in the original, plus a whole lot more.\n\nI recommend this game with a controller, especially an Xbox 360 controller. This game is casual, and if you played the original extensively, you will fly through this game. It is not a long game, but then again, the original wasn't either.\n\nWith that said, I think it is priced fairly. I was given this game as a birthday gift, and I really had fun casting it live on Twitch, and beating the game. It really game me that retro feel, with a modern pollish, with very crisp and sharp graphics, and animations, with beautiful sound, and classic, straight forward controls.","July 1, 2014","true","4.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It really feels like a well done tribute to the original game.\n\nMy only complaint is that it takes a lot of replaying to earn enough money to "buy" the in game unlockables, and the cutscenes/dialogue seemed to break up the action a little too much for my taste. Otherwise, if you played this game as a kid, I say this is a must buy.

I do. It was when I got Duck Tales on the NES. Thats all I did was  play for  the next few weeks. Nostalgia. It was one of the best titles on the NES. Duck Tales was one of the more creative games on the system and along with Little Nemo they take me back to when I was a kid... So they remade Duck Tales. Good.\nthe good. First the music is great, and the voice work of the orginial cast of the show is very very cool. The game play is mostly untouched so thats nice and the controls feel tight. The graphics are cell now and look like the show. So for a 2D remake it has excelled in presentation. But...\nThe negitves are minor but annoying. The dialog. Ehh... You will listen to at times two minutes of dialog. This wouldn't bother me but most of the time it is in the middle of the game. You can not just speed by it either. So the game comes to a stop, where as the orginal was nonstop. Infact there are other slight changes as well. Rather than collecting enough money to progress you will have to collect things instead. Another thing is this game is much easier. The NES had a difficulty curve to most of its games. Duck Tales was one of the easiest games on the system. This remake is much easier. I never died. I fired up my NES and yeah I died here and there. It's not the Remakes fault but a modern controller and more health pick ups do make it easier.  This isn't hold your hand easy, but not hard. Oh and theres unlocks, cause of course.\nThe theres the reports of Nvidia cards freezing at the end. I got through it no problem.\nThis is a good game. Really good. It reminded me more of why I liked the show as well as the NES game. It does a lot right and does not stray to much from the orginial which is nice. The orginal is still my favorite, but I like this a lot. I dought they will remake Duck Tales 2, but one can hope. Personally I would rather see a Little Nemo remake, but thats just wishful thinking. Now no matter what I do I can not for the life of me get the Duck Tales song out of my head.\n","May 11","true","4.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If that wasnt enough they added another even worse obstacle course after that! All without saving progress or stuff you collected in this level. This end is like 100% harder than the rest of the game and you have only your 2 extra lives to spend, before you have to start ALL OVER AGAIN this stupid level.\nMakes me wanna scream "YOU ♥♥♥♥♥ DUCKTALES" at the developers, but they dont seem to care anyway.\nNice graphics and good old memories, destroyed by this duckpoo ending.\nBtw you can either rush through the levels or spend time collecting diamonds that you can then spend for boring sketches of ingame graphics.\nOh yes, the controls are bad. The collission detection as well. Just as the good old game. "Remastered" are only the graphics and the additional levels (tutorial & final).\nPull a Dagobert and dont spend a dime on this!\nDuckTales boohoo.","January 1, 2014","true","21.6"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

It is nostalgia packaged with original voice acting from the cartoon, cheap 3D art for the environment and nice looking 2D art and animation for the characters.\nAnd that's exactly the problem with this game; it can't decide wether or not it should poke at your nostalgia from the TV cartoon, or from the NES video game so it decides to go for both.\n\nSeeing that this is an actual video game, I would've prefered if they spent more thought into the actual game elements and less so with the dozens of character conversations which is forced on the player.\nIt is fortunate that you have the ability to skip 'cinematics', you do however feel less so when you have to replay a level, and then skip the three consecutive cinematics the game just has to deliver to you in order to get back to playing the actual game.\n\nWayforward has gone through great lengths to make sure the character controls and level design feels like the NES game, but seems to have forgotten to ask if the old game actually had good level design and avatar game feel.\nControlling Scrooge McDuck does feel good and precise, but it doesn't matter much when the levels themselves are simply annoying.\nThe character is playing the game to collect treasures, you are motivated to find more and the game has diamonds scattered everywhere.\nIf you enter a room and theres a corner where there's nothing: there's something there, go there, jump a little and diamonds will appear. The game habitualizes the player to nervously search through every nook and cranny for diamonds all the time. At this point you might as well make them visible to begin with, and not have the player go there, then leave the spot to then have the diamond spawn and then finally go back to the spot to pick it up. It's tedious, it breaks flow.\n\nAnd that's essentially what the game's biggest flaw is; it doesn't understand flow. All the running around, jumping, bouncing and searching for things which the original game did well, gets obscured by useless fluff that's only there to make us remember an old TV cartoon.","July 6, 2014","false","5.5"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

The music and voice acting are also very nicely done.\n\nThe story is boring, and interrupts gameplay way too frequently to keep me immersed in the game experience. Perhaps the designers should've kept the game action going while voice acting happens on top. Since the characters are basically just GIFs with voice acting on top, I'm shocked you can't skip the current line of dialogue without skipping the entire cinematic.\nThe writing is written for ages 6 - 10, so it's very hard to stay interested in what the characters are talking about.\n\nThe game bosses' AI is very simple. Each boss follows a strict pattern and doesn't even take into account Scrooge's position onscreen. This makes every boss battle an exercise in simple pattern recognition. This is expected from the original NES title, but I would've liked to see a "remastering" of the challenge from the original game.\n\nThe game feels repetitive after the second level is completed. I'd only recommend this for fans of the original show, and even then, wait for a Steam sale.","December 23, 2013","false","8.8"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

Duck Tales: Remastered is a blast from the past to any owner of NES. Back when games were amazing and nice to play, WayForward Technologies helps us to relive our happiest moments in one of the most memorable games of all time. Like the title suggests, its obviously remake of original game with better graphics, and updated soundtrack.Plus to original remastered in glorious HD levels we get also 2 additional levels for story progression. While in NES version there wasn't that of a story, here we get like a lost TV episode, with original cast from the show itself. While story can be just simple to understand it shouldnt be taken too seriously because its children show, so nothing serious or be amazed with. But most important part is redesign of original 5 levels. They are all back and looking better than ever. In addition the original soundtrack also is back with some addtions which makes it much better. We are used to the fact some games are being re-released as HD but in this case we get a bit more.You can also unlock some arts and other stuff if you are interested, or even swilm in Scrooge gold vault like he does in TV show. Now all we need for total nostalgia happines is 2nd Duck tales game from NES and maybe remake of Chip n Dale just for fun. If you didn't play original NES game, take this one. Its our childhood and looks at it's finest. 9/10.- Dima Voronovich, Russian Pro reviewer.","September 4, 2013","true","3.1"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

You can be just slightly off from hitting a foe directly on their head and take damage. This is made worse by the amount of 1-hit deaths in the game. 2. The games controls are terrible. This ruins the game for me. Its tragic just how bad they are when you see the depth the game has to it. How are they bad? They are unresponsive. One secound you are holding the pogo button bouncing along, and for no apparent reason you stop and will most likely die or take damage. You won't always jump or move when you want to as well.

The first being the years of dialog which gets very old very fast and the other being the controls feel a little stiff and un responsive at times.  The dialog wouldnt bother me so much if I could only skip it, but I cant. I wouldnt recomend this game as I found it very frustrating with the large amount of cut scenes with long un needed dialog.  If you can get passed the amount of time you will be sitting at idle infront of your screen it really is a fun game, but I find myself reading a book while waiting for the cut scenes to end as the story isnt exactly grand in any way.","January 6, 2014","false","2.1"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

However the game was never an innovative platformer and that did not change. The level design is very linear with little variation in the gameplay. It is also a little unfair in certain spots to artificially increase the difficulty. At the end of the remake you can buy art, music and more from the money you collected during the game. This is a nice feature but for me not enough to replay the game. Also I miss the possiblility to switch to the original 8bit graphics as possible in the remastered Monkey Island games. In total, it was nice to play it again but more for sentimental reasons.

The level designs from the original game are still as great as they ever were but every other thing in this game actively makes it worse than the original.\n\nIt has this bizarre art style.

This minor quibble is nothing compared to...\n\nTHE VOICE ACTING! What the ♥♥♥♥? Scrooge's voice actor must have been mumbling 5 feet away from the microphone.

Actually it might not be a problem because he says the same 5 or so unbelievably lame lines over and over for the entire game and I don't think being able to hear them clearly would actually measurably improve my experience.\n\nOh, and get ready to mash start because this game has cutscenes piled on top of cutscenes.

Imagine Mario stopping to have a short conversation with Yoshi every time he shows up, and making a little joke every time you eat a mushroom. Sounds pretty annoying, right? It is.

Scrooge didn’t listen though, he didn’t care. All he wanted was all the swag the world had to offer him and the Beagle Boys’ heads mounted on his mantelpiece and nothing on Earth and the Moon would stop him on his blood-soaked journey.

So in my mind, the Metacritic user score of 66/100 isn't that far off. It's difficult to live up to nostalgia, and this game probably was facing unrealistic expectations from the beginning. The game is kind of fun, but it's not particularly challenging once you figure out where all the health pick-ups are. I enjoyed the boss fights, but the platforming elements were a little tedious.\n\nI was getting annoyed in the last level, in particular the last part (don't want to spoil the ending) because I thought it required a ridiculous level of precision. But then I finally realized that using the analog was the problem and switched to the D-pad, all was fine.\n\nGraphics-wise, the characters are beautifully drawn. Unfortunately, the same love and attention wasn't put into the scenes, where some of the things like helicopters look like they were drawn and shaded with Microsoft Word ... not even Microsoft Paint.\n\nThe collectibles consist of art and music that can be unlocked through purchases using money you've gathered in each level. Unfortunately, you would need multiple playthroughs to get to the best stuff: the music and TV show art. And I didn't enjoy the game enough to play through more than once, so I was never able to access them.\n\nThe unskippable cut scenes were the biggest grip that most people had. The developers added an option to skip them. I will say that the worst part of the cut scenes wasn't that they were unskippable (at the time) ... it's how utterly boring the dialogue was. Seriously, was the show ever that bad?\n\nI have to deduct a point in principle for the unskippable credits, taking the overall rating down to a 5/10. I don't generally mind unskippable credits, but 1) at least making it interesting, and 2) don't include every single person in all of Capcom!

The game is pretty good looking, bright & colorful with big sprites and everything. With the exception of the Transylvania-level (which looks really good in the outdoor-parts) backgrounds are a tad bit bland - but overall no complaints about the visuals. Together with the music and the voice-acting (both of which are excellent) you can't argue much about the presentation. It really is that good.\n\nHowever, what's not so good is the fact that the game has some weird slowdown / micro-stutter every now and then and doesn't seem to run at a consistent speed. Making it feel unresponsive/sluggish at times. The next issue I have is the constant cutscene spam, and the incredibly awkward way of skipping them (you press pause, select skip cutscene and confirm - if another cutscene is triggered right after the one you skipped, you do it all again). The cutscenes are nicely done and all, but I am okay with seeing them one time - especially when I am trying to get something done on hard mode / extreme mode (where you will die at times) this gets old very quickly. Until I noticed you can skip cutscenes, I was actually so put off by this that I was going to uninstall this right away. The cutscenes really take away from the flow and speed of a classic NES title. To give you an example; by the time the Amazonas introductory cutscenes are over I would have actually finished the entire stage in the NES original already.\n\nWhich brings me to the next design decision I am not okay with, almost all the level have you gather X items in order to proceed to the level boss. Not only wasn't that in the original - it serves no real purpose other than to slow you down. It's neither fun or exciting in my book. Same goes for a lot of retooling of stages that have altered layouts now - I am not sure I would actually dare to touch anything that was conceived by a good portion of the team behind the original Mega Man, those guys were/are geniusses. The Wayforward people, not so much. The result is a couple of area just feel somewhat off, being more difficult than they used to be.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that the game doesn't feel NES-like enough when you actually play - I don't know what it is, but whenever I play the NES original or the Gameboy version everything feels tighter, more precise. There is definitely some weird stuff going on with hitdetection, I have been hit by spikes while still standing or jumping from a solid block right next to a spike-pit, it isn't funny anymore. Visually though, you can't tell that you would get hit - there is no indication that the hitbox on the spikes is that enormous. Generally I am having more trouble hitting stuff with the pogojump too, compared to the original. Generally speaking, everything feels a bit off.\n\nTo sum it up, everything Wayforward added or changed made the game somewhat worse than the 25 year old original. They should have looked at Bionic Command Re:Armed by GRiN which was basically just a cosmetic update with a few convenience-options added it but kept the game pretty much as it was. Wayforward however "remastered" Ducktales by adding clutter no one asked for that ends up breaking the beautiful simplicity of the original.\n\nAs said above, if you love Ducktales the TV show - get this; but if you enjoyed the original game for reasons like simplicity, speed, flow or generally enjoy classic console games consider yourself warned. Instead of Ducktales Remastered I definitely will be hooking up the NES whenever I feel like going on a treasure hunt with Scrooge McDuck again.","February 16, 2014","false","5.2"," 7 of 21 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","7","21","0","0"

Well it was on sale this week so I decided to pick it up and I don't regret it.\n\nIt's a great nostalgic throw back to a franchise many of us 80's and 90's children grew up with. The music has been remastered wonderfully and I haven't had any problems with the controls. It's great that they managed to get (most?) of the voice actors back, that only make's it that much more special.\n\nThe stages are mostly left the same, with minior changes to make it more action packed or intresting, I haven't had a problem with the stages, in my opinion it simply makes the whole experience more "refreshing".\n\nA complaint that seemed common with people was that the cut scenes cut away from the game and while agree that sometimes there's a little bit TOO much banter interuppting gameplay, it really hasn't been a deal breaker for me and some of the major cutscenes explaining the story and situation has been nice since the original NES game didn't really do too well of a job explaning anything, not that as kids we needed it, ha ha.\n\nTo be perfectly honest, the only major grip I have is the art. The character sprites are wonderfully done, except the artists seem to neglect minor touches to the game, such as having the character's mouths move when they talk. The biggest issue I have though is that the sprites look wonderful, as if they were hand drawn and then everything else is a stagnant, ugly, pastel colored 3D rendered. The two styles class horribly and the artists who were doing the background and foreground work didn't even bother to have proper perspective when considering the sprites. In the introduction stage, doors, chairs and other background objects look to be 10 times bigger then character sprites and it's just lame and offputting.\n\nDoes that ruin the game for me? No, not really, but it is a little offputting and really made me wish they would have just went that extra mile for attention to details. All in all, I'd pick it up, especally if it's on sale.","January 4, 2014","true","6.4"," 0 of 8 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","8","0","0"

As someone with fond memories of the original product from my childhood, all I can say of this newer experience is that the developers did too good a job copying the original game... right down to the mechanics from 1990.\n\nThat just happens to be something you really, really should not do. Nobody wants to have games today like we used to in the 90's. There are no saves; The hit boxes are unforgiving as all hell; The game pulls super annyoing and unfair tricks on you all the god damn time.\nThe only way you get through this game is by trying, and dying, a LOT. And starting from the very beginning, every single time. In a word, this game is hard. But it is not hard in the good challenging sense. It is hard in the frustratingly unfair, hair-pulling, rage-inducing sense.\n\nAlso annoying: Too plentiful and slow-paced cutscenes that you have to rewatch every single time, although you can also skip them every single time.\n\nThat said, it is beautiful to watch and listen to. But I know it's not something I'll be coming back to.\nWayForward focused on the wrong things to upgrade for 2013, and it's a shame.","December 21, 2013","false","7.8"," 25 of 73 people (34%) found this review helpful","34","25","73","0","1"

Unfortunately, the developer failed to understand the current market and decided to design the game as if it were an NES game. Essentially, a lesson in frustration.\n\nFirst, you can't save whenever and wherever you want. I realize many games do this today, but it's a poor design choice. All it does is increase the overall level of frustration and repetition in a game. We've had the capability to save our games when and where we wanted since 1984 (see King's Quest), yet in 2013, it's a rarity because game developers are lazy.\n\nSecond, the controls are awkward and that's even using a gamepad. The pogo jump, for instance, is hit-or-miss and rarely works right when you're attempting to do it over spikes or some other deadly landmass.\n\nThird, it seems half the damn game is cutscenes. Don't get me wrong, I like a good story as I grew up on classic Sierra Online and LucasArts Adventure games, but these cutscenes are unskippable and the story involved is barely adequate, even for a game based on a cartoon.\n\n[EDIT - I've been informed that cutscenes are now skippable. I don't know if this is a recent development or not, but considering I couldn't skip them, the above paragraph is remaining. That said, this factor should no longer be held against the game if cutscenes are indeed skippable.]\n\nNow I know some people will say I'm being unfair, as this game is essentially a remake of the NES title. To them I reply: Deal with it. This isn't the same game. Yes, it's a remastered version, but it's not the same.\n\nChanges have been made in every step of development, so there's no reason why a real save game mechanism, skippable cutscenes and a decent control scheme couldn't have made it into the works. Saying the NES game was like this is a poor argument, because the NES title had hardware limitations that modern consoles and PC do not.\n\nSo what's good about this game? Well, it's DuckTales (which I imagine means something to you if you bought it) and the original voice actors have come back to play the parts they did in the cartoon. In addition, for those who wanted a near-perfect replication of the NES title, this is a masterpiece.\n\nIn the end, I have to say I don't recommend this game. It's not terrible (I've certainly played worse), but it's very frustrating. While I'm sure that'll bring some gamers to a near ♥♥♥♥♥♥ state, it's far more likely that same level of frustration will drive most gamers away.","December 5, 2013","false","1.0"," 13 of 53 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","13","53","0","3"

Just because there is no "in-between" possible.\n\nAlright, so the good sides of the game are simple. Beautiful graphics, great soundtrack and funny dialogue. It feels great to WATCH the game.\n\nHowever it has a few negative things, that cause massive frustration. And its not about the difficulty of the game.\n\nFirst of all - the game is easy EXCEPT when dealing with floor spikes. You see, the hitbox for the character is much bigger against spikes than the character sprite suggests. You will walk close to land spikes and get hurt despite the fact you are not physically touching them.\n\nSecond - Some jumps are artifically difficult, because the character for some reason bashes his head in places. You will get frustrated the most about this in the last level. The game is basically very easy UNTIL you hit the very last level, where the difficulty IS THE SAME AS OTHER LEVELS but has a few STUPIDLY SETUP places where the jump is hard to make due to the glitchy hitbox. Not to mention you have a limited amount of lifes to handle it and you cannot replay the other levels to stockpile. So if you fail on your first attempt you will be beating the last boss several times over.\n\nThird - The amount of Cutscenes is overbearing. The dialogue is nice and funny, but when you have to replay the game - boy, will you skip a ton of them. 3 Cutscenes in a row, 3 minutes of gameplay, cutscene, cutscene 1 minute of gameplay, Cutscence. Get used to this - this will happen.\n\n\nI used to play this game on the old NES. I love how they added a story to this game, but I prefered the old version when it comes pure gameplay. This one has two extra levels, which is nice BUT the weird spike in frustration at the end is really stopping me from giving it a positive score.\n\nOverall? You have to decide.\nI am not lying about the cutscene intensity - they are everywhere and YOU WILL feel it. The game is VERY SHORT. If you would be skipping Cutscenes all over, a proficient player can beat this game in an hour. I recommend getting this on a sale. Otherwise, seriously, it is not worth the price.\n\nI'm sorry to the guys at Wayforward. I really love the graphics and humor and music of the game. But it has these small itches that frustrate you during the game.\n\nYou have been warned dear reader.","December 8, 2014","false","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Therefore, my view on this game is entirely based on my experience with this version alone.\n\n'DT:R' is a very hard game to review in my opinion, as it certainly felt like a classic NES side-scroller with some strong gameplay, bosses and challenges very reminiscent of the NES days - however, I found the controls (for the Xbox controller at least), to be somewhat frustrating. The controls aren't particularly responsive and can lead to very unfair deaths and lost lives (an example being on thorny ground, when you pogo over it but accidentally slip up and lose a life, then cannot jump properly until you lose immunity, hence meaning you lose another life). It's moments like these which really ruined 'DT:R' for me personally.\n\nThe cutscenes are quite a drag. Fans of the TV show may really enjoy them as I'm certain they are very true representations of the actual characters, however for me, the humour is for the most-part very cringey and I feel like the cutscenes really do interrupt the gameplay. This is a nitpick, but another thing which bothers me is the fact that the cutscenes 1. do not have a clear 'skip' button, you have to select 'start' then 'skip cinematic', 2. are strangely animated, despite looking great, the lack of mouth movement and over-usage of only a number of animations really bothered me as sometimes Scrooge would look grumpy for no apparent reason.\n\nThe design for the levels really lets down the game in my opinion. The constantly respawning enemies and the ropes really bothered me whilst playing. The ropes are your means of climbing, however can sometimes be unresponsive and work very differently to ropes/vines in other games such as Rayman Advance. However, the levels do look great for the most part, even if the first level has some very repetitive backgrounds that you wish they could do more with. The characters look magnificent and all are immediately recognisable to their TV counterparts. Likewise, the design of the hub where you choose levels also works really well, with endearing cutscenes every single time that are enjoyable to watch, until you've had to watch hem more than once.\n\n'DT:R' is a challenge by no doubts, as were many games in the NES library. However, I found that the difficulty came from trying to handle the controls, rather than the actual challenges that were presented to me (aside from the ghosts that you cant kill, screw them). The bosses are challenging and will take you several attempts, however, once again I blame the number of attempts I took when killing the Amazon boss entirely on the odd controls.\n\nOverall, 'DuckTales: Remastered' is a game I would only recommend 100% if it is nostalgic for you. Whilst I would recommend 'DT:R' to anyone who enjoys side-scrollers and challenges, this game seems to cater more towards those who were either fans of the original NES game or the TV show itself. DuckTales: Remastered is by no means a bad game, but I don't know whether I would call it a good game either - enjoyable, yes, but the controls and level design let it down big time for me personally.\n\nOverall: 2/4","December 25, 2014","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hazardgaming/recommended/237630/","hazardgaming","hazzaricks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hazardgaming/","88 products in account","DuckTales: Remastered is a game I went into with no experience of the previous NES classic, I was aware of the original but aside from brief mentions to it in episodes of AVGN and other unorthodox gamers, I never got to appreciate the NES original. Therefore, my view on this game is entirely based on my experience with this version alone.\n\n'DT:R' is a very hard game to review in my opinion, as it certainly felt like a classic NES side-scroller with some strong gameplay, bosses and challenges very reminiscent of the NES days - however, I found the controls (for the Xbox controller at least), to be somewhat frustrating. The controls aren't particularly responsive and can lead to very unfair deaths and lost lives (an example being on thorny ground, when you pogo over it but accidentally slip up and lose a life, then cannot jump properly until you lose immunity, hence meaning you lose another life). It's moments like these which really ruined 'DT:R' for me personally.\n\nThe cutscenes are quite a drag. Fans of the TV show may really enjoy them as I'm certain they are very true representations of the actual characters, however for me, the humour is for the most-part very cringey and I feel like the cutscenes really do interrupt the gameplay. This is a nitpick, but another thing which bothers me is the fact that the cutscenes 1. do not have a clear 'skip' button, you have to select 'start' then 'skip cinematic', 2. are strangely animated, despite looking great, the lack of mouth movement and over-usage of only a number of animations really bothered me as sometimes Scrooge would look grumpy for no apparent reason.\n\nThe design for the levels really lets down the game in my opinion. The constantly respawning enemies and the ropes really bothered me whilst playing. The ropes are your means of climbing, however can sometimes be unresponsive and work very differently to ropes/vines in other games such as Rayman Advance. However, the levels do look great for the most part, even if the first level has some very repetitive backgrounds that you wish they could do more with. The characters look magnificent and all are immediately recognisable to their TV counterparts. Likewise, the design of the hub where you choose levels also works really well, with endearing cutscenes every single time that are enjoyable to watch, until you've had to watch hem more than once.\n\n'DT:R' is a challenge by no doubts, as were many games in the NES library. However, I found that the difficulty came from trying to handle the controls, rather than the actual challenges that were presented to me (aside from the ghosts that you cant kill, screw them). The bosses are challenging and will take you several attempts, however, once again I blame the number of attempts I took when killing the Amazon boss entirely on the odd controls.\n\nOverall, 'DuckTales: Remastered' is a game I would only recommend 100% if it is nostalgic for you. Whilst I would recommend 'DT:R' to anyone who enjoys side-scrollers and challenges, this game seems to cater more towards those who were either fans of the original NES game or the TV show itself. DuckTales: Remastered is by no means a bad game, but I don't know whether I would call it a good game either - enjoyable, yes, but the controls and level design let it down big time for me personally.\n\nOverall: 2/4","December 25, 2014","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Anybody who's heard of the NES has heard of DuckTales (along with Mega Man and other classics) and to this day it is the best licensed Disney game ever made. Based on the animated series of the same name it wowed fans and gamers (and fans who were gamers) like few others had.\n\nBut time moved on and in this new century younger gamers might not be willing to try the original since 8-bit is so old-fashioned, no? Wayforward Studios though (all fans of the original and the animated series) tried their hand at this remake you can obtain here on Steam. In a nutshell, it is perhaps *the* best remake of a game that I have ever played. Like with the original, the controls are tight, the music (though remixed) is still ear-candy and the new additions (levels, voice actors from the animated series, graphical updates etc.) blend incredibly well into the original game's feel.\n\nSure, some small issues are there (the new final level is kind of a big leap in difficulty among other things),  but there is no possible way to deny that DuckTales Remastered is a fantastic addition to your games library. If you like Mega Man, Shovel Knight and other platforming titles with a bit more to offer than rinse & repeat then this the a game for you. If you grew up with DuckTales (re-runs across the world to this day) then you'll love it. With multiple unlockable objects, tracks and what not there's a good challenge in it as well.\n\nEnough of my yakking, get the game. If its on sale, buy another copy for a friend.","December 26, 2014","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well, it's Ducktales, isn't it, in every way that matters. The spirit is there, and it evokes it brilliantly, taking what the NES game had presented to us before and updating it visually into something incredibly pleasing on a key aesthetic level.\n\nAnd then the final level happened. The occasional control issue only gets worse when the game demands more from you, and so what should have been a triumphant finale to a decent enough game became frustratingly hard, through no fault of my own (not that I'd say I'm great at games, it's just that the issues were definitely on the game's part in this instance. That, followed by an awkward final boss and an extra platforming section where that lack of responsiveness stops you getting through a fiddly, precision-demanding bit of timed jumping.\n\nTheres ways it could have been better, something like removing the lives system, or even just having a checkpointed continue option upon game over, but to demand that a player go through every problematic moment over and over just to get to whatever stumbling block they last came to. There's an argument to be made that changes such as these weren't made to preserve the original game's intent, but when you call your game a remastering you may as well go all out, yeah?","August 28, 2014","false","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I’ve never played the original NES game, so even without the nostalgia glasses, I still think Ducktales remastered is a wonderful game with some minor flaws.\n\nThe game features a 2.5d look with hand drawn sprites and backgrounds and they look amazing. The redone themes are catchy, memorable, and kickass. They also brought back the original actors to voice the characters. The controls are tight and responsive. There is plenty to unlock with the gems you collect from character art, music, and even sketches from the show.\n\nSome of my minor gripes with the game are the cut scenes are fairly frequent and take you out of the experience. Every time you find an item there’s a cut scene. While you can skip them you have to do so manually, there is no option to skip all cut scenes.\n\nDucktales also isn’t for everyone. It features the classic NES difficulty if you lose all your lives you have to replay the level from the start. I found the game to be challenging but fair. The game only became frustrating at the very end where you have race to the top.\n\nOverall Ducktales is a great and challenging platforming game that still holds up well after two decades.\n","August 4, 2014","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love how they try to bring back my childhood by adding storyline to the game vs its original NES counter part but man is it over done.  I did like they brought back the original voice actors to do it that was a bonus.  Not to mention if you have to start over, you have to watch them again again and again.\n\n3)  Boss battles -  Most bosses keep their originality but they change stuff up which, imo, hurts a remake.  If you are going to make a remake, keep the originality of it.  Don't break it by changing it completely.\n\n4)  Price -  For $15?  That's a bit steep.  I got this on sale for $5 during summer sale.  The game is only about 5 hours long overall.  If you get it for a discount, that's my recommendation.","August 18, 2014","false","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

Just because there is no "in-between" possible.\n\nAlright, so the good sides of the game are simple. Beautiful graphics, great soundtrack and funny dialogue. It feels great to WATCH the game.\n\nHowever it has a few negative things, that cause massive frustration. And its not about the difficulty of the game.\n\nFirst of all - the game is easy EXCEPT when dealing with floor spikes. You see, the hitbox for the character is much bigger against spikes than the character sprite suggests. You will walk close to land spikes and get hurt despite the fact you are not physically touching them.\n\nSecond - Some jumps are artifically difficult, because the character for some reason bashes his head in places. You will get frustrated the most about this in the last level. The game is basically very easy UNTIL you hit the very last level, where the difficulty IS THE SAME AS OTHER LEVELS but has a few STUPIDLY SETUP places where the jump is hard to make due to the glitchy hitbox. Not to mention you have a limited amount of lifes to handle it and you cannot replay the other levels to stockpile. So if you fail on your first attempt you will be beating the last boss several times over.\n\nThird - The amount of Cutscenes is overbearing. The dialogue is nice and funny, but when you have to replay the game - boy, will you skip a ton of them. 3 Cutscenes in a row, 3 minutes of gameplay, cutscene, cutscene 1 minute of gameplay, Cutscence. Get used to this - this will happen.\n\n\nI used to play this game on the old NES. I love how they added a story to this game, but I prefered the old version when it comes pure gameplay. This one has two extra levels, which is nice BUT the weird spike in frustration at the end is really stopping me from giving it a positive score.\n\nOverall? You have to decide.\nI am not lying about the cutscene intensity - they are everywhere and YOU WILL feel it. The game is VERY SHORT. If you would be skipping Cutscenes all over, a proficient player can beat this game in an hour. I recommend getting this on a sale. Otherwise, seriously, it is not worth the price.\n\nI'm sorry to the guys at Wayforward. I really love the graphics and humor and music of the game. But it has these small itches that frustrate you during the game.\n\nYou have been warned dear reader.","December 8, 2014","false","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I played this on a rather low-end (in terms of gaming) PC and both lag and random crashes were present, souring my experiencing with the game.

Capcom didn't pull any punches for this, and while I've had my issues with them in the past, this does a good job of making up for it.\n\nI enjoy this game immensely.

Well, it's Ducktales, isn't it, in every way that matters. The spirit is there, and it evokes it brilliantly, taking what the NES game had presented to us before and updating it visually into something incredibly pleasing on a key aesthetic level.\n\nAnd then the final level happened. The occasional control issue only gets worse when the game demands more from you, and so what should have been a triumphant finale to a decent enough game became frustratingly hard, through no fault of my own (not that I'd say I'm great at games, it's just that the issues were definitely on the game's part in this instance. That, followed by an awkward final boss and an extra platforming section where that lack of responsiveness stops you getting through a fiddly, precision-demanding bit of timed jumping.\n\nTheres ways it could have been better, something like removing the lives system, or even just having a checkpointed continue option upon game over, but to demand that a player go through every problematic moment over and over just to get to whatever stumbling block they last came to. There's an argument to be made that changes such as these weren't made to preserve the original game's intent, but when you call your game a remastering you may as well go all out, yeah?","August 28, 2014","false","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's updated versions of the music tracks, with the option to use the original NES BGMs if you prefer, and a number of gallery unlocks with lots of concept art and such.\n\nI have only two major complaints:\n-It's quite short and pretty pricey for the hours you'll get out of it (at full price); buying it on deep discount is strongly recommended\n-There's actually too much inter-level dialogue, and it really breaks up the pacing of the game.  I get they wanted to put the voice actors to work, but this is a simple action platformer and we don't need several minutes of dialogue every time you find a plot coupon.\n\nIf you were a fan as a kid and you're looking to be nostalga bombed, this is highly recommended.

Its actually the first NES game i ever beat as a kid.  So i was really excited when i heard about this remake. and it did not dissapoint.\n\nThis is how a remake should be done.  They didn't just go back and redo the sprites and remaster the music.  They added all new levels, and revamped the original levels and bosses.  And they fleshed out the story with lines voiced by the original cast of the show!\n\nThe game is classic NES challenge but now has difficulty settings which effect lives and starting health so even if your not up old school challenge you'll likely be able to get through this game with a little pratice.  There are tons of extra unlockables like concept art and music from both the remake and the classic game.\n\nMy only minor complaint is since you can unlock art and music of the original NES game, i think it would have been an especially nice touch to be able unlock the original game itself but alas no such luck.  Still can't hold that against them when what we've been given is so great.   If you loved the show or enjoy oldschool platformers then this is well worth $15","June 22, 2015","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The levels stay incredibly faithful to the original game's design, the graphics are crisp and colorful and the soundtrack is incredible. I would have said that WayForward did an amazing job, had it not been for one major flaw; the hit detection. This has been something that has plagued any "retro" style game, whether it be remakes of old games or brand new ones. The hit detection in DuckTales is not only poorly presented but also incredibly frustrating. For example, pogo-ing onto enemies with just outside of their hitbox results in you taking damage, even though graphically it shows itself as landing the hit. Another example is during the Amazon boss battle, there is a segment where his head will fly from the background to the foreground, making it tough to discern where he will land/hit, which results in the loss of a heart. With the old-style sensibility of restarting levels or boss battles once you lose your 3 hearts, this quickly reared its head as this game's Achilles Heel. DuckTales is a personally beloved franchise, be it the game or the show. I still highly recommend this game, but I feel WayForward made a huge mistake with not patching this issue before release.","December 26, 2013","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Either the enemy or Scrooge's hitboxes are way too liberal. Now, I'm not saying it needs to be pixel perfect, but it needs to be within reason of the pixels which, in many places, it is not even remotely close. So the hitboxes are really bad and loose in a lot of places.\n\nThe second major flaw is, for enemies that take multiple hits (See bosses), they get an invincibility to them after each damaging hit, which is completely reasonable, however they then become like ghosts and you can move through them. This is bad because often by the time you are getting away or through them, they come back into being solid and then hurt you, all because they don't retain their physical parameters during invicibility. This could have easily been resolved by either giving a shorter invicibility length or by simply making them not become ghost-like on hit.\n\nOther than those two flaws, the game is very fun and quite enjoyable.","December 26, 2013","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The hate for this game's cutscenes grew so large that I almost didn't buy it, and thought they were completely unskippable until I figured out otherwise.  The game feels a lot more complete than it ever did on NES, and the voice acting and graphics are all really well done.

The 2D, hand drawn art is excellent, matching the character design faithfully, and it meshes well with the 3D backgrounds.  The voices are just as excellent as they always were thanks to the talent of the actors fans have long known and loved, although lines may feel stilted as the timing of each line's seems to have been set by the engine without much regard for the performance.\n\nThe music is good.  It doesn't quite seem to know if it wants to be an epic, synth-orchestra take on the original or if it wants to be chiptune homage, and so it doesn't seem to hit the heights of either style.  It also loses some impact when voice samples are played over it before it has had a chance to make its full impression.\n\nThe control is very fluid, much more so than the original game.  This feels good at times, but it does not always work well with the gameplay.  In the NES game, the necessity to commit to certain motions (like a jump arc) was not a problem thanks to the fact that the environments were well aligned to your control capabilities.  Here, the extra fluidity means that I cannot have as much confidence of my choices in movement.  And as such I cannot feel as though I know for sure where I should be aiming in tricky jumps, etc.  It is something I will get over with time, but that "solid", "sure" control from the original game is not quite replicated here, and it caused a great deal of frustration.\n\nBut what's here is still excellent.  If you are a fan of the original game or DuckTales in general, you should consider it.","December 27, 2013","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My personal recommendation is definitely get it if you want to, but I would do so while it's on sale (I've usually seen it at around $7.50); since this is a remaster of an NES game, it's fairly short, and there are not a lot of achievements (for at least the PC version).

So naturally, I thoroughly enjoyed this game, and it stayed true to the original.  So why don't I recommend it than?  Well... the game hasn't been supported by the developers since November of 2013, and a lot of newer post patch video cards are having issues with this game.   Myself for instance, I can't beat the game because upon defeating the final boss, my game freezes every single time, which has been reported by a host of other newer players.\n\nSo in summary, as much as I enjoyed the game, I can't in good conscience recommend this to anyone when the devs are not responding to players reporting issues, the game is no longer being supported, and this freezing bug persists.  Really Valve should pull this off of the store, or at least put a large disclaimer indicating that this title is un-compatible with newer video cards post November of 2013.   Regardless, this issue is incredibly frustrating, and it's anger inducing to be met with the sound of crickets from the developers, who've essentially abandoned this game.

The new music sounds great, the gameplay is just as good as it ever was (not to mention you can change the pogo settings to whichever you're more comfortable with), and the cutscenes really captured the spirit of the show, especially since most of the old voice actors reprised their roles.\n\nThe difficulty selection is a nice feature for those who either want to just breeze through the game without too much of a problem or jump right into the harder modes that the original NES game was known for. Not to mention that any money that you collect throughout your adventures can be used to purchase things in the gallery such as game artwork, music of the game's soundtrack, to even art from the TV show! Or you can just swim in your earnings in the Money Bin. That works too. Plus, after beating the game at least once, you can play the game with the 8-bit soundtrack, which includes the NES soundtrack and 8-bit versions of the new music added in this game. Though, I'm kinda disappointed that they didn't make an 8-bit version of the Final Boss theme, but oh well.\n\nOverall, Ducktales is definitely a game that I recommend to those looking for a good side-scrolling platformer, those who are Disney/Capcom/WayForward fans, & those who grew up with Ducktales, whether it'd be the show and/or the video games. In any case, I'm going to wait for the day that they'll make another Remastered game based on another hit show from the Disney Afternoon, but only time will tell when that day will come.","August 15, 2014","true","12.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I’ve never played the original NES game, so even without the nostalgia glasses, I still think Ducktales remastered is a wonderful game with some minor flaws.\n\nThe game features a 2.5d look with hand drawn sprites and backgrounds and they look amazing. The redone themes are catchy, memorable, and kickass. They also brought back the original actors to voice the characters. The controls are tight and responsive. There is plenty to unlock with the gems you collect from character art, music, and even sketches from the show.\n\nSome of my minor gripes with the game are the cut scenes are fairly frequent and take you out of the experience. Every time you find an item there’s a cut scene. While you can skip them you have to do so manually, there is no option to skip all cut scenes.\n\nDucktales also isn’t for everyone. It features the classic NES difficulty if you lose all your lives you have to replay the level from the start. I found the game to be challenging but fair. The game only became frustrating at the very end where you have race to the top.\n\nOverall Ducktales is a great and challenging platforming game that still holds up well after two decades.\n","August 4, 2014","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't mind paying $14.99 for a game that would have never hit the market unless someone was willing to develop it without visions of making insane profit.\n\nI can't argue that the game is "short", for it's price, but I don't view how I spent my money as a corporate investment, I had far - far more fun completing this than I had with any other game in a long, long time.\n\nAs for the price, this game's concept isn't about "completion", it's a 2d sidescroller, and one that's meant to be replayed, I played it on every single difficulty, completing everything, as it's meant to be played - that's why it has leaderboards, that's why there's 4 difficulties, they could have easily made 5 more levels, but it would make no sense. The game was a homage to simpler times, a nostalgic reminder that despite country of residence, we share common childhood memories.\n\nTo make a conclusary remark, if you don't have a sentimental value in playing this game, just don't - and I don't mean that in a rude way, but the game simply isn't meant for you, it's meant for those who hold a sentimental value in seeing a bit of their childhood remade.

The gameplay for the most part hasn't changed much, but I wouldn't have it any other way. I loved taking out enemies with a pogo cane/stick when I was a kid and I still do. It just doesn't get old. There is some variety added to the gameplay like the bosses' patterns being changed. The mix of handdrawn 2D sprites and semi-3D backgrounds are great. The game is colorful, nicely animated, and just gorgeous all around.\n\nIf I had to point out one flaw, it's the cutscenes. They're entertaining to watch, but they happen too often and interrupt the game.

The five stages from the original game are faithfully reproduced in stunning hi-res graphics, the music is a phenomenal reimagining of the original 8-bit tunes, and the addition of voice acting (by and large using the voice actors from the old Disney cartoon!) tickles the nostalgia bone on an additional level.\n\nMy only real point of complaint is the addition of a final, sixth level in which the game's end boss is found and battled. The problem lies not so much with the level itself, or even with the post-final-boss Metroid-esque escape sequence which is an incredibly unforgiving gauntlet of instant-death hazards that requires both memorization and reflexes to pass. No, the problem is that losing all of your lives during that escape sequence kicks the player right back to the beginning of the final stage, forcing him or her to slog through its entirety again. It struck me as unfun padding in an otherwise tight, high-quality game.\n\nThat said, DuckTales: Remastered is a great nostalgia kick for people who grew up playing the original NES game, and it is overall put together quite well. Players who did not grow up on the original, however, might be put off by its comparatively short length, but anyone looking for a fun platforming romp should enjoy the game.","July 23, 2014","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I managed to rage on the Easy level though so if you are not too into platformers you might wanna prepare yourself for mild frustrations. Also there are cut scenes that might seem a little childish to some but you can skip them which is a excellent feature in that case. Overall the game runs excellent on this older computer of mine.

It retains a great deal of the nostalgia of the original, while adding an updated look without going overboard. The music is lovingly redone from its 8-bit origins, and the gameplay feels much like it did on the NES (with the exception that the controller is larger, but that's only because I played with an XBox controller). The addition of the voice cast from the cartoon, makes for a nice touch too, as it was nice to hear them again. Made me pull out my DVD collection to watch the series again, and it the process, introduce my 2 year old daughter to the cartoon (which she now asks for all the time).\nI know many had issue with the amount of cut scenes added, but I didn't find it too bad. After your first play through, simply turn off cutscenes through the options and you're good. It did find the game easier than I did the original, but I don't know if that was me remembering the NES original being harder from the mindset of my younger, early gamer years or that I've just grown better at gaming.\nOverall, I'd recommend this to anyone; fan of the original cartoon or not. It's a nice bit of nostalgia for those who are and a fun, classic-styled side-scroller for all.","June 28, 2014","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a bit of a short/simple (you can see there's lots of work put into it though) game considering it costs 14€ but I don't personally feel cheated because there's difficulty levels for everyone (even for the most demanding). I managed to rage on the Easy level though so if you are not too into platformers you might wanna prepare yourself for mild frustrations. Also there are cut scenes that might seem a little childish to some but you can skip them which is a excellent feature in that case. Overall the game runs excellent on this older computer of mine. If I have to think anything negative it would be the lack of volume control in-game but you can easily lower it manually from your computer.","August 24, 2013","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I wish they would come out with a soundtrack for this game.  The music for the levels are unique and suit the environment and tone of the game.  I can't say whether it is better or worse then the 8Bit rendition.  Thusfar, I've only heard the Amazon level music and the Money bin version, and I don't care for either of those, but that still leaves a few levels worth of music to go.\n\nVoice acting - Getting as many of the original voice actors from the cartoon as they could was a good call.  It made it seem like I was listening to the cartoon.\n\nLevel design - Overall was fairly good.  While there was some sticky points that they could have improved on (the finale, for instance), the levels were beautifully designed, appealing to the eye, and offered just enough challenge to keep you from getting bored but not so much that the game was frustrating.  Ending aside.\n\nThe Neutrals:\n\nCut scenes - While I enjoyed watching them generally, they suffered from the fact that the characters were 2D in a 2.5D setting, and as such were limited in what they could do.  Personally, I think the game would have benefitted from cutting down the actual cut scenes to main points (as in, cutting out the ones for individual items) and animating them as 2D cartoons.\n\nDifficulties - There are multiple ones.  Nothing really all that special about it.\n\nThe Cons:\n\nLag - This may have just been an issue with my rig, but there was an odd amount of lag in the game.  While my computer generally is able to handle harder hitting games, it was bogged down by this game, which meant the game hesitated - oddly, this presented as pauses in dialogue and cut scenes, and as slower animation throughout the game, but somehow didn't hinder actual gameplay.\n\nThe Gallery - While the gallery as a concept is excellent, and I love the idea of using the money you gain in the levels to buy the extras, the fact you had to unlock so much from one section to unlock the next area to buy from seemed silly.  To me, it seemed like a ploy to force you to replay the game, just to get the content you wanted - which for me was the music and background imagary.\n\nThe ending gameplay - While I won't go into what the ending part actually was, I will say this:  In and of itself, the game ending was fairly good story-wise, but the execution of it was terrible when it came to gameplay.  This game had fairly even difficulty throughout, up until this segment - in which the difficulty randomly and suddenly spiked.  The overall design required a level of precision at points that made the game feel near impossible to finish, especially in comparison to the rest of the game.\n\nWhile the game does have its faults, it's a good game overall.  I bought the game on sale, but likely would have bought it at its full price had I found it at that.  $15 is a steal considering the amount of work that went into making this game, and the sale prices even moreso.  While I can't vouch for the nostalgia of the game, for someone who is a fan of Ducktales and the richest duck in the world, I would definately suggest at least giving this game a shot.","January 7, 2014","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Which can be overlooked, but really? Transylvania needs dubstep?\n\nThe game is a lot of fun and it holds up to the NES version in difficulty. You can spend hard earned money to unlock concept arts, character art and so on. If your someone who needs to unlock everything then there is plenty to do here.\n\nI hope more remakes come out. Chip & Dale and Darkwing Duck would be excellent choices.\n\nAbove all I highly recommend this game to new and old gamers.

The game still feels fun to play, but the stages just lack the awesomeness factor for me. The boss fights are awesome and definitely the most fun part about the game until...\n\nYes, the last part of the last level. You have two segments after the actual boss fight. Sure, the original title had the coin-chasing race and it was hard enough in the original title and meets the expectations in this one as well. But there's more to come even after that. The level that makes you realize just how clunky the controls in this game actually are as it requires extreme precision and makes so many players ragequit as grinding through the whole level over and over again without losing a single life to have another proper shot at the last segment is just frustrating. I have no problem with games being hard and frustrating as an avid fan of roguelikes, but this game just takes it to a whole new level of frustration because it's all caused by controls.\n\nI'm kinda on the fence about this title. It's not that expensive so it will most likely be appealing enough for the money for many. It's just sad that the game could have been so much better with some more effort put into the controls and level design.","February 13, 2014","false","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
