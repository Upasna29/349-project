Then they throw a few enemies at you which move faster than you, shoot tons of bullets, and if you get hit a couple times you die.  Then you have to start over again, watching the 2 minute intro again.\n\nYou can't shoot in any direction but up, which makes it so difficult to hit things that are beside you shooting tons of bullets.  You move so slowly that you have to concentrate on not getting hit, but many of them are impossible.\n\nCan't do it.  I'm sorry, if the introduction was easier and you could skip that intro, I would be willing to give it another chance.  I tried 3 times, and was waiting at a static image for 90% of the duration of my session.  Not exactly fun.\n\nObserve:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjhO3Jzq6mY\n\nI just want to add to this that if we had a way to skip past this initial part, it would be a lot more tolerable to keep trying.","September 6, 2015","false","0.2"," 73 of 79 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","73","79","5","1"

The graphics are detailed and interesting. The audio is fantastic. The sequence with the exploding plane, exotic dancers and Donald Trump is just the best!\n\nI recommend you buy this game for all your friends right now!\n","December 29, 2015","true","0.8"," 1 of 48 people (2%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","2","1","48","11","0"

There have been multiple times where I would click "Exit game" and then my computer will not let my mouse work anymore and I have to sign out of the account just to open a window.","February 12","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
