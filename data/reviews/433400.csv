Hadn't read Kim in years and was pleasantly surprised by how quickly the book came back to me and how faithful this new medium is to the original, with great graphics and an interface that really gives you a feel for the period.\n\nKeeping both the tone and character of the book could have been heavy handed or confusing but delightfully neither is the case and this game of exploration, spiritual questing and intrigue recreates Kipling's story in an accurate, fun and accessible format.\n\nYou gain both information and respect as you encounter more characters throughout your journey, and there are plenty of different ways to increase your skillset and ease your exploring - though theft has thus far been my favourite shortcut to success.\n\nLooking forward to seeing how Kim progresses, both as a character in my charge and as an engaging new game in my arsenal.","April 11","true","0.9"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","1"

I'm happy to say that it was money well spent, as this game is a little beauty...although "little" is a bit misleading as there's loads to explore and do in the atmospheric world of Kipling's most impish creation.\n\nColonial India, with all its charm and craziness, is wonderfully brought to life by the hand-painted illustrations, the awesome soundtrack, and the use of Kipling's original text.  The gameplay is solid, with the choices you make having a constant effect on Kim's character, both in terms of his happiness and his skillset.  I seem to find myself in moral quandaries way too often, but maybe that's me!\n\nHave only had a couple of sessions so far, but am looking forward to many more. Would definitely recommend to anyone, particularly if, like me, you're a fan of the original book.","April 12","true","0.6"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

Wonderful atmosphere - the soundtrack and art style really give the feeling of India at the end of the Raj. Kim is a favourite book of mine so it's amazing to see it brought to life in this way.\n\nThere seems to be a huge amount to explore -- I managed to get the train to Umballa to carry out the secret mission of the stallion's pedigree, but you can travel in many different ways and many different directions from each of the top down map areas. I chatted to a Sikh policeman and met a regiment of Irishmen, and can't wait to see what new adventures this world may have to offer, and what strategies will open up for surviving Kimball o'Hara's quest for enlightenment.\n\nAnyway, for anyone with an interest in books, india or beautifully produced games, I think Kim is very much worth playing.","April 11","true","0.4"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

The art work is simply gorgeous, really bringing colonial India to life. There's a really wonderful atmosphere in the game, it makes me want to just let the game run by itself while I stare at the bustlings of the villagers, getting on with their daily lives.\n\nI never read the book Kim, but it doesn't really seem like you need to to enjoy the game. The story is very well written and as you would expect reads more like it would be worthy as a literary piece than a video game (somewhat a rarity in games I guess haha).\n\nIt's nice to play a game not about dragons/fantasy/space/shooting things/collecting things etc. A game just about people and their personal struggles instead is genuingly refreshing. I found it interesting seeing how my character grows throughout the game, starting off as a lowly beggar to something more respectable. It felt my decisions made a real impact on his character.\n\nI look forward to playing some of the more varied 'play styles' and trying out different decisions in future playthroughs.","April 12","true","2.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I was intrigued. And so far I have enjoyed my exploration of India in the time of the Raj. The gameplay is very easy to pick up and seems to have great depth as environments are much more interactive than they first appear. There is an impressive level of research behind the game on display and the game map is gorgeous. I recommend you take a look at ‘Kim’ but if you are interested in the era or the source material it’s an essential buy.","April 11","true","1.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Kipling's prose draw you right in to the end of the Raj and help set the tone & mood for one of the most evocative RPG experiences I've played. The warm palatte and surpisingly sophisticated sountrack compliment each other beautifully and the gameplay, whilst easy to get to grips with seems well layered. Each mechanic is simple in itself but great thought has clearly gone into how they relate to each other creating a pleasing level of depth that players can approach at their own pace.\n\nPlaying an RPG with such a reality based lore is a novelty (at least for me) and Kiplings India is so rich, relevant, fascinating & wonderfully realised here that a genuine drive to explore and discover is itching away at you even before the (less than 5 min) Tutorial is over. The dialogue evokes it's period beautifully but is brief enough to ensure a brisk pace that let's you explore & experiment many times over many play throughs\n\nKnowledge of the book is not necessary but there's a good chance you'll have ordered a copy before you're done.","April 12","true","1.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Unless i feel something is special which Kim most certainly is in my opinion.\nFirst off i have never read the book but i have now purchased and it's on my reading list.\nKim is like a geography, history and survival game all rolled into one.\nThe first thing that appealed to me was that the gameplay reminded me of one of my favorite ever games Burntime a post apocalyptic scavenging game ( hint for your next game pleeeease devolpers this game design is perfect for it).\nAnyway back to the game there is lots to do and the hunger and mood system keeps the player on their toes thinking what to do next. Should i beg for food,steal or even kill ?  Running errands from over the many locations and keeping the wonderful characters happy earns you money,food and favour.\nGo by train,horse or on foot to the many interesting locations of colonial India you will not be disappointed give it a try.","April 19","true","43.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

Having backed the Kickstarter I moved this up my backlog, and I finally managed to play just under an hour.\n\nI personally would love a story-mode without the survival mechanics (food and rest), but they are already balanced enough to be acceptable, even on a 'slow gaming' day. The setting and Kipling's story are obviously great, the art style is lovely, too - but I am a sucker for hand-drawn games. The top-down style works well, and the colours support the Indian feel of the game.\n\nThe language in the games sticks to Kipling's original, the "Indian" English and historical terminology - and that is great. If you are not a native speaker or have never read a 19th century English novel you might struggle.\n\nI am looking forward to travelling through India on a beggar's budget again.","April 19","true","0.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
