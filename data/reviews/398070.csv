Instead of spiral shapes it follows the Flappy Bird principle to lead your mouse pointer through gaps in barks. The rotation of the playfield gets faster and uncalcable on higher levels and difficulties (highest is futile). 3 Powerups (clock, snowflake, shield) are helpful. The tutorial is also OK. Unfortunately there are some bugs like loosing the mousepointer on the window borders or too late activated powerups. Also is insuffienct how a proper pointgiving algorithm has not been developed yet. So I had to grind much time til the 10M achievement unlocked ...","March 13","false","11.3"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","17","20","0","3"

E.g. You could give the black square (the thing we move in the game) more emotion or colour, maybe even a border. A black square is ok, but they could've done better.\n\nSound - The soundtrack that is implemented into the game gives an electric vibe when going through the levels in the game. The voice that narrates in the game has a robotic sound, matching the music and giving the game a futuristic touch.\n\nGameplay - The gameplay in Protoshift is really simple after the training difficulty, which tells you about the abilities and what happens in the game. After this it's basically an endless mode, with higher time comes higher levels and with high levels becomes higher amount of turns, speed etc. Though, you can change the difficulty to hard, very hard or futile to make it more of a challenge. (If it's not challenging enough!)\n\n\nPros & ConsPros:\n- Easy Controls and your chose of sensitivity (depending on your mouse)\n- Addicting gameplay\n- Has cards\n- Colourful and nicely textured background\n\nCons:\n- Has some bugs (Dying randomly or survivng when touching the obstacle etc.)\n- Graphics needs to smoothened a bit more.\n- Doesn't have an "easy" or "intermediate" difficulty, besides the training mode, which enforces you to go through the basics again\n\nConclusionIn conclusion, Protoshift is worth it's price and it's a well made game with a good concept, but it could be improve on in future updates. I would recommend this game to anyone wanting a great challenge or anyone who likes indie games in total. 7/10 ^^My rating (will change if they make a difference in future updates.)\n\nFor more recommendations by LL's Game Giveaways and Reviews on quality indie games or ones with high potential follow our group curations here!","January 19","true","2.5"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","4"

It's a reflex game where you navigate your cursor around plain, spinning rectangles, with barely anything you can call graphics, and little to no gameplay.\nAchievements slapped onto this game also have no subsance, just like the game itself. Other than the standard "complete the level" achievements (which mean getting to the 5th score multiplier on every difficulty level, after which it just stops and stays forever on the fifth one, which is also one of the reasons it feels like an unfinished product, but I digress) there is nothing more that either tedious busywork (dying 1000 times, or collecting 100 of the rarely appearing power-ups, speaking of which, other than the invincibility one, they don't even matter) or just impossible (getting 10 million points which, depending on the difficulty level, would force you to stay alive for around 1,5 to 3 hours... but no one is actually sure, since the game doesn't give you any feedback to how many points you actually get, and even the developer is not completely sure as to how the game calculates that.)\nThere's not much I can say about this game, since there is not much to the game itself (which is why 80% of my review is about achievements.) It has Steam Cards which is nice, I suppose.","March 25","false","4.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

In this game you only use the mouse and prepare yourself for a good challenge.

This does not affect my review.~\nTags: Action, Indie, Great Soundtrack, Minimalist, Mouse Only.\nIntro Protoshift is an action indie game developed by Reflextions and published by Black Shell Media, released on January 15th, 2016.\n\nPros:3 different difficulty modes + training. The 3 different modes are Hard, Very Hard, and Futile. They are in endless mode with each level having increased difficulty, rotating pipes, and speed. If you die, you have to start from the beginning again.\nUpbeat electronic soundtrack\nThere’s a level of difficulty for everyone to enjoy the game\nControls are super simple: just drag your mouse and avoid the pipes (think of it as rotating flappy bird with a square, but instead of clicking, you use your mouse to control the square).\nIndication when the rotation direction will change, making it easier to predict which way to move your square.\nIn-game stat system to keep track of how many times you die, how many power ups you have collected, and your score (which keeps adding up from how well you play each time?).\nPrice is fairly reasonable ($1.99) if you are planning on spending time playing this game and don’t mind a few bugs here and there.\nTook me 30 minutes to get to level 5 on Futile mode, the rotation speeds are insane!\nOn the title screen, you can practice without the square or the possibility of dying (the screen rotates just like a regular level) I found this to be interesting, whether it was intentional or not.Cons:The slow time power up slows down the music but doesn’t slow down the rotation, making collecting the power up obsolete.\nVarious bugs that need polishing, like dying when you barely touch the wall, the screen is left shaking when you die at a certain point(you have to die again to stop it shaking), and the slow time power up slows down the music but doesn’t slow down the rotation.\nPowerups spawning in bizarre and unreachable areas\nExtremely short to play initially: it only took me 10 minutes to beat hard and very hard (just past level  5 where you can get the achievements). After this, you can go back and challenge yourself to get a new high score. I got all the achievements within a few hours (some of them require a higher score, more deaths, or collected power ups).Suggestions for improvement:There could be an option to change the color of the square (or even change the shape) by earning different color unlocks as your score increases. They could also add some more content, like a few more game modes (maybe unlockable?)\n\nSummary:The things that stand out in this game are the upbeat soundtrack, level of difficulty, and simple to pick up controls. A great timewaster game that will put your reflexes to the test.\n\nMy implemented rating system:Run away! 1-2/10\nHandle with caution… 3-4/10\nBuy on sale: 5-6/10Every day purchase: 7-8/10\nMust buy: 9-10/10\n\nThis game’s rating: 6/10. A great way to waste some spare time. If you feel you would enjoy this game, go ahead and buy it for $2. I would personally prefer to buy this game on sale in its current state because of how many bugs there are.\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/398070\nRead the review here on our website: {LINK REMOVED}http://giveaways.pl/reviews/protoshift/\nVisit our steam group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/vantom","January 28","true","4.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","1"

So often your dying depends much more on the random generator than on your skill that this game felt unfair far too many times. Another example of lazy design is a slow-time "powerup" that basically kills you the moment it wears off 50% of the time because you don't have enough time to get in sync with the movement of the walls again. Adding a second or two of invulnerability after this feels like game design 101.\n\nOn the more technical side, the game has a very limited range of resolution options and no full-screen mode. Leaving the window makes the square that represents you disappear which ruins the already shaky collision detection completely.","March 5","false","0.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Sadly, this game has only disappointed me.\n\nIt's such a small game yet it has bugs everywhere. Dying feels cheap as often it's caused by some bug or just bad design (mostly bugs, though). Requirements for such simple game are ridiculously high (which are ofc written in store, but it's doesn't change that requirements are too high).\n\nBugs I encountered:\ncolisions are ♥♥♥♥ed up, which leads to:\nsliding over a wall and not dying\ndying on nothing, like you would hit invisible walldied right after I took powerup that's supposed to make player immortal for 5 sec\nsome weird shaking camera effect was locked which made the game unplayable until I died and it got away (I probably died when this effect was about to show in previous game)\nblack square dissappeared without dying, which ofc made further game unplayableThere is also no indication that the screen rotation is about to change direction, leading you to simply die. It's probably a bug. I'm not sure but it was mentioned in super boring tutorial that it was supposed to display big warning sign when the rotation is about to change, so you don't go into wall, trying to actually avoid them. This is what makes dying cheap, imo.\n\nPowerups are useless and actually often makes the game harder (slow-mo doesn't work the way it should, it does slow everything but rotation).\n\nI'm really surprised how there can be so many mistakes in such a small game.","January 18","false","2.2"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","7","13","0","0"
