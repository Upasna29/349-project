Where Shovel Knight is a modern adaptation of a beloved genre, Rock Boshers plainly is that genre. And while this may give it a somewhat esoteric nature, there's a lot to love in Tikipod's Victorian, snack-coveting Martian romp.\n\nAs any fan of that era of videogames will have you know, nostalgia is far too generous, and the 8-bit era was downright, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ terrible. However, the very spartan capabilities of these systems are what made the games such a joy to experience, as any able developer could only desperately try to navigate the poor hardware. Whenever you can pull something even mildly decent out of those systems, it's like pulling a rabbit out of a hat. Inexplicable magic!\n\nThis is the paradigm wherein we encounter Rock Boshers. Tikipod has been zealous in its loyalty to the system limitations of the ZX Spectrum, and has produced a game that would have been an instant classic in the European-loved home computer's heyday. Objectively, the creative design is a real pleasure. The visuals are stylish and well-made, the sound design is a joy to hear, and the (albeit basic) plot and premise are perfectly silly, making Rock Boshers exude charm. The gameplay, however, is much more subjective: it feels like an 8-bit game. That's a very much "take-it-how-you-will" kind of statement, as I enjoy it and praise Tikipod for succeeding so well in its design, but...\n\nI feel that the later parts of the game may provide a greater challenge than some players are interested in taking on. True to form, some parts even feel like they're difficult for the sake of making the overall game last longer (which is exactly how 8-bit games were designed). In this way, the visuals may be deceptively benign to the less initiated audience.\n\nThat said, I completed the game at around the 4 hour mark, and for perfectionists, I perfected all of the achievements at around 5 hours, so it's a relatively quick and enjoyable turnaround.","December 29, 2014","true","5.2"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","23","25","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/retroalarm/recommended/298790/","retroalarm","Alarm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/retroalarm/","2513 products in account","A game with a retro aesthetic is nothing new.  However, one based on the graphical limitations of the ZX Spectrum microcomputer is somewhat unusual. I won't bore you with the technical details, but many games on the Spectrum featured graphics that had two colours in an 8*8 pixel square other games were mostly monochrome).  This game takes that style as its inspiration but does not stick to the limitations.  The display is in 'widescreen' and there is no attribute clash.  Huzzah!\n\nA twin stick shmup at heart with puzzle elements, this is a fun game. The controls are tight, but 8-way firing with an analogue stick can be a little imprecise but it isn't a game-breaker.  The music is pretty good, with several nods to AY chiptunes (the title tune is reminiscent of Jonathan Dunn's title tune in the Spectrum 128 version of RoboCop).\n\nThere a four minigames to unlock which offer differing amounts of fun (your mileage may vary), but are on the whole well executed.  There are leaderboards for these and the main game too.  The game has a surprising amount of variety in its levels and some stages can be moderately difficult.  All told, this is an enjoyable game which builds a lot of fun on its retro foundation.  To paraphrase the blurb on many Codemasters’ cassette games, "This game is absolutely worth playing!"\n","January 16, 2015","true","4.1"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tgr1/recommended/298790/","tgr1","Kelly Osbourne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tgr1/","434 products in account","Get ready for a jolly good adventure back in time to the 1880s, and a trip to Mars as the young Queen Victoria. Vic has had enough of her sheltered palace life and decided its time for an adventure of her own, so she’s jumped aboard a one-way trip to Mars. Once there, it quickly becomes apparent that something sinister is afoot on the red planet, and she’s determined to find out what’s going on. Prepare for zombies, killer worms, jammy scones and rocks galore, in Rock Boshers DX.\n\nIt’s the second time in as many weeks that Tikipod has released a revamped title from their back catalogue, but is Queenie’s adventure a rip-roaring success or a trip best left back in the past?\n\nRight off the bat you’ll probably notice Rock Boshers DX: Director’s Cut’s retro stylings, with its ZX Spectrum palette of a whopping 15 colours! The visuals serve as an indication of what is to come. Rock Boshers harks back to a time when even state of the art games looked slightly ♥♥♥♥ – but in a charmingly ♥♥♥♥ way, of course! A time when gameplay was king, and was, more often than not, hard as balls.  It’s a game that requires patience, good timing and a keen eye for details.\n\nEach of Rock Boshers’ 20-odd levels is a part shooter and part puzzle, meaning you’ll need to juggle both elements at the same time.  Levels are short, at a few minutes apiece, but they can be infuriatingly tricky if you don’t pay attention. To proceed through each stage you’ll need to unlock a series of coloured gates by acquiring the corresponding keys,. The challenge comes from figuring out which path to take through the level, and staying alive while you do so. Vicky will make good use of her pistol, and unleash 8-way directional bullet fury upon a variety of different Martians that stand in her way. Fortunately, she’ll have the latest weapon gadgetry at her disposal, as well as copious amounts of tea and jammy scones! Each level features 3 hidden pickups and leaderboard time-challenge, giving trophy hunters a real challenge – if they can hack it, that is.\n\nRock Boshers DX: Director’s Cut is technically a very simple game, but its got a likeable charm at its core. The quintessentially British humour exhibited in each level, from its tea and scone pickups, to the chucklesome dialogue from some of the characters you meet, enriches the experience tremendously.\n\nIt’s down to personal preference whether or not you like the throwback graphics, but one thing we can all agree on (I hope) is that the soundtrack kicks ♥♥♥. Electric Cafe have returned with a finger-tapping, head nodding chiptune treat that is sure to weedle its way inside your head.  I dare you not to like the main theme.\n\nThe game has no noticeable issues but if I had to nitpick, I’d question the sensitivity of the right analogue stick when firing. More than once I found myself backed in against a corner only to be firing my gun in a direction other than the one I was trying to aim in.\n\nIf you enjoy tricky games, and can get past its “retro” aesthetic, you are sure to find a lot to like in Rock Boshers DX: Director’s Cut. It’s a well-realised remaster of a game that was already pretty good to begin with, and now it’s probably on a platform that you own! You owe it to your Queen and country to give it a try, there’ll be tea and jammy scones in it for you if you do. Pip pip!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nReview first published here:  http://criticalindiegamer.com/2014/12/rock-boshers-dx-directors-cut-review-ps4-ps-vita-pc/ Thanks to Tikipod for the review code.\n\nDon't be put off by the graphics, this is a really fun and challenging little game.","December 11, 2014","true","1.1"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/murveman/recommended/298790/","murveman","Murveman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/murveman/","256 products in account","I'd first like to say that I absolutely love the original Rock Boshers. It is definitely one of my favorite Indie Games, if not my favorite. It captures all of the asethetics of ZX gaming to its fullest beauty, provides interesting and creative gameplay, a good chunk of difficulty (I still haven't beaten it after all of these years), and some light humor. I always assumed development of the game would go no where and it would fade into obscurity. Being remembered as merely a demake like Gang Garrison.\nMan was I ever overjoyed when I discovered that DX existed! I haven't played it long yet, but it's definitely better than the original (which is a must-get already). Here's my breakdown...\n\n-Graphics: Fantastic. It's difficult to work with such a minimal sprite resolution, but Dugan does it masterfully. I was worried that the graphics were updated when I saw the screenshots, but you can choose between Console Mode and Old Computer mode, so no worries. Very faithful to the ZX aesthetic.\n-Sound: Just fine. Nothing repetitive or annoying.\n-Music: The soundtrack is great. Though I'm personally pretty disappointed that the original old-school sounding soundtrack is not an option. It really added to the atmosphere.\nGameplay: I haven't gotten far yet, but the controls are tight, and I assume the difficulty will get as hard (if not harder) than the original. Which is really hard.\n\nIf you like old school, minimal, or just plain unique games; do yourself a favor and buy this.\n\nEdit: Aw, what the hell? PS4 players get 4 Player Local Battle!? Why is that not included in the PC version? The game is an homage to old COMPUTER games and the developers leave out features for the COMPUTER release.

The games themselves were rarely any good, but given there were hundreds on each disc it provided at least a moderate distraction in a time when I wasn’t looking for much more.\n\nRock Boshers DX feels a lot like a game I would have found on one of those discs. It’s aesthetically nostalgic but in a way that feels less a product of a specific era in games, and more something that’s just attempting to pass itself off as one. It hasn’t any novel ideas of its own, nor does an adequate job establishing its very simple set of mechanics. It’s a game without a direction that’s perhaps a solid first step for a developer cutting their teeth on game design, but nothing I’d want to actually play.\n\nI can’t exactly describe how Rock Boshers plays, because it tries to do so many different things that it can play dramatically different depending on which level you choose. One moment you might be exploring a ship in a sidescrolling perspective, the next shooting zombies from a top down view or running in circles collecting keys to open the door to the next level. This variety doesn’t come as an interesting compiling of mechanics though, but as a directionless buffet of equally distasteful parts.\n\nThe only context to be found to Rock Boshers inconsistency is a narrative that seems to think itself far more interesting than it actually is. Exposition sprouts everywhere and none of it has anything compelling to say. There’s a familiar plot of worker exploitation and experimentation somewhere here but it’s so clichéd that you could likely guess the entire storyline on that premise alone. Most often the narrative seems to exist for the purpose of contextualizing every poor design decision, taking the game in so many different directions that it comes out with no identity of its own.\n\nNothing in Rock Boshers ever feels like it exists for a purpose. Most levels are designed to send you running into every corner, tediously winding through tunnels and trying not to die as the difficulty ramps up rapidly. If Rock Boshers is dull at the start, it’s agonizing once the training wheels come off and it throws everything it has at you with no regard to whether you can realistically defend yourself or not.\n\nIt feels like a long time since I’ve yelled at my monitor in such extreme anger and frustration as I did attempting to finish Rock Boshers, each death feeling cheaper than the last. Your means of interacting with the game are so simplistic that you’re often left with only a very narrow means of completing a given level, yet what those means are is often a challenge in itself to comprehend, made worse when each level seems to introduce yet another half formed idea which you then need to learn on top of everything else.\n\nFor as commonplace as retro inspired games are now, Rock Boshers is one that feels far more reliant on nostalgia alone to sell itself than most. In that regard I can’t fault it for being a game I could have feasibly played two decades ago, but times have changed and even if it might have held my attention back then, I couldn’t wait to leave its soulless existence behind today. Rock Boshers is a game made for another time and place, it’s just a shame it’s one I never want to return to.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMuNgXvp32Y&ab_channel=MrNinjaSquirrel\nFull disclosure: Rock Boshers DX was reviewed using a copy provided by the developer.
