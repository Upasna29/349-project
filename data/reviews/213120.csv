Herb","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kaszimir/","128 products in account","Very soon once haters start realizing this system was put up, the reviews will be filled with negative ones. Before that happens, let me drop my opinion here. It's a great game at it's heart, it has an interesting storyline that makes you want to play through each chapter. The main feature here is it's brilliant multiplayer mode. Now you've probably heard of the hackers in this game, and yes, it's true. However the game has a thriving community which will guide you into friendly, hacker-free matches. Is it worth $60 though? No, I can not say this. However it would be worth it at any other price, so when the next sale hits, go for it!","November 25, 2013","true","34.2"," 280 of 318 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","280","318","0","9"

Everything about this game is better than the first. You get better graphics, better gameplay, and the story is just awesome. It's a short game and I completed it on normal in about 6-7 hours. Some people miss the co-op campaign but I think it was removed for the better. Each character now has a special set of challenges that wouldn't have been possible with co-op. You really do get more diverse gameplay.\n\nThere are some features removed from War for Cybertron. Double jump no longer possible for some reason. Every transformer has the dash ability and sprint. There is a new feature that's a great idea, I feel. The teletraan 1 store appears in Campaign and Escalation mode. Basically, you have access to most of the weapons in the game, right off the bat. There are weapons that require you to find blueprints throughout the campaign. Once you find them, you can buy them with in-game coins. There are some weapon limitations. You can only have 1 standard weapon paired up with 1 support weapon at one time. Do you want to carry 2 rocket launcher type weapons at once? Not possible. This limitation might prove annoying to some, but I felt it created balance and I never felt the need for more than was given to me.\n\nThe multi-player mode is vastly improved and all the maps are fun. They are not too big but big enough to offer a challenging landscape. With endless customization everyone can have their own unique look.\n\nAll in all, this is an awesome game and High Moon did the Transformers community proud. It's got special touches that many older fans will appreciate. I highly recommend this game.","December 30, 2013","true","15.7"," 154 of 170 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","154","170","0","5"

The single player campaign has a strong plot which plays out a bitter war between the Autobots and Decepticons during the final moments of the planet Cybertron.\n\nGame primarily playes like a 3rd person corridor shooter.  Game was executed very well so the weapon and movement controls feel really good.  Animations were well done and the robot to vehicle transitions look really good.  The single player campaign will take roughly 10 hours or so on regular difficulty and consists of 15 chapters.  The player does not get to choose which Transformer character they play through the game with the campaign regularly featuring a different character between chapters.  Characters will switch between Autobot and Decepticon depending on which part of the story the player is currently playing and the game appears to feature equal time between the two factions.  Difficulty on normal settings was neither too easy or difficult, but there were times that were a good challenge.  Fortunately the checkpoint system was done well enough that you will not have to redo too much after defeats.\n\nMany of the fan favorite characters are featured as playable or ally, and the inclusion of others like Metroplex, the Combaticons, Insecticons and the Dinobots were very welcome.  Both the voice acting and the soundtrack were extremely well done.  This helped create a good feeling of chemistry between the characters and sets the tone of the game.\n\nThe game does have a multiplayer feature which I have tried only briefly.  It is cool to create a customized Transformer to do battle against or with other players.  I understand that cheating does happen quite regularly but I am hopeful that this will not hurt the experience too badly.  I will review this feature further as I play it more.\n\nI had a lot of fun with this game and highly recommend it to those who are G1 Transformer fans.","February 22, 2014","true","25.5"," 100 of 104 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","100","104","0","3"

The game then flashes-back 6 days, and drops you in to play through the final few days of the conflict and events leading up to that historic last stand. An engaging story-fueled campaign takes you across a lovingly-crafted, richly atmospheric Transformers universe, putting you in control of popular characters (from both Autobot and Decepticon factions) such as Optimus Prime, Megatron, Starscream, Bumblebee, Cliff-Jumper, Jazz, Grimlock and more.\n\nGameplay | Graphics | Sound: From a technical standpoint, gameplay is a pretty standard Third Person RPG | Shooter | Racer (for the Transformation bits). While there is nothing groundbreaking here, there are several elements that do elevate this title – 1. Unlike other RPG’s where you control one main character throughout, here each of the campaign’s 13 chapters is framed through the viewpoint of a different Transformer allowing the gamer to control many beloved characters each with their own weapon systems, unique transformation, special abilities etc, providing some great overall variety - 2. The game’s pacing is also well constructed with third-person Shooting sections broken up through Stealth, Platforming and Vehicular missions, and intermittent set piece elements that are truly epic in both size and scale. – and finally, 3. A good number of collectibles, upgradable weapons, multiple endings and ultimately, the sheer glee of controlling some legendary characters builds great replayability into this title. Sound Design is also particularly noteworthy, with a grand operatic score accompanied by voice-actors from the original TV-series reprising key roles as Optimus and Megatron. Great graphics, well optimized K&M controls, an ‘Escalation | Survival’ mode, and a highly customizable Multiplayer experience round out a well polished title.\n\nFlaws: For all it does well however, one cannot escape the glaring fact that gameplay is rather restrictively linear. Further, an uneven Multiplayer experience (of dropped connections, hacks and exploits, exclusion of the popular Co-op option) in addition to an unseemingly high pricetag of $60 for a 3-yr old title (Note: Steam Sale Price at $15), mar the overall package.\n\nOverall, ‘Transformers: Fall of Cybertron’ is a fantastic interpretation of a beloved franchise – and although a pretty average RPG on a technical level - its grand cinematic campaign, breathtaking scale, phenomenal sound design, cast of iconic characters and high replayability, elevate the game to something more than the sum of its parts. This is an ode to the Transformers universe made by fans, for fans – and this is as close to ‘Prime’ as you will ever get – Highly Recommended!

I remember begging my parents to buy me those voyager/leader/ultra class figures so I could re-enact the epic and badass battles between the cunning Decepticons and the heroic Autobots. I grew older, and then I saw the train wreck cash grab of a quadrilogy that Hollywood has produced, and my heart grew heavy. It was hard for me to remember the awesomeness of the story about the fight between good and evil, between Primus and Unicron, between the Autobots and Decepticons. Then I saw this game on sale and gave it a shot. When I first played it, I shed a tear. It was beautiful. The voice acting, the soundtrack, and gameplay made me a 6 year old again. It was very nostalgic and brought me back to the old days of watching those cartoons and playing with the action figures. While the movie industry has failed the franchise, I am very happy that the video game franchise has not. If you are a huge Transformer fan like I am, I would definitely buy this, especially if it is on sale.","January 24","true","2.5"," 70 of 75 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","70","75","3","0"

Improving on the original title, the combat mechanics are more varied (your robot avatars stealth, platform and fly across the levels as opposed to the first game's lackluster cover-based combat) and there is more variety to the robots themselves. The level design is somewhat improved; the original game was endless halls of metal but there is somewhat more variety in the sequel. Still, compared to the diverse  world-spanning locals of other franchises, the levels can't compare in color or style; it is, after all, based on a robot-planet.\n\nStill, while the gameplay is improved it is still not exceptional. It is the robots that are the stars of this show; the Transformers so many of us grew up with. Fighting battles with Jazz, Starscream, Metroplex and Optimus (amongst many others) is something no fan should miss. But I can imagine that people who don't love the franchise might find the experience lacking.","November 25, 2013","true","20.2"," 74 of 85 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","74","85","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/c9soulkey/recommended/213120/","c9soulkey","Soulkey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/c9soulkey/","744 products in account","Short review:Fall of Cybertron takes the successful formula from the War For Cyberton prequel and improves it in almost every way possible. The excellent campaign with highly enjoyable gameplay and impressive visuals provide you dozens of hours of fun, even if you are not a big fan of the Transformers franchise in general. Highly recommended to anyone who likes action-filled TPS games and for Transformers fans it’s  a MUST-HAVE!\n\nLong review: Following the events of the previous game Fall of Cybertron takes place during the last six days on Cybertron. With the Autobot city, Iacon, fallen and the planet core corrupted, the Autobots are forced to leave their homeplanet, while the Decepticons are preparing their last assault to annihilate last of the survivors.\n\nDuring the campaign you will play as iconic robots from both Autobot and Decepticon factions. For the sake of the story, the character selection and co-op have been discarded completely this time and you will assigned to take control of a fix character during each stage, since each chapter tells the events from a different perspective. Don’t worry though that your experience will be limited because of that, the fact is there’s enough variety of the playable characters and the way each chapters are so well built up, you can quickly forgive this change as you play through the campaign.\n\nThe core experience is still the non-stop action with satisfying gunplay and vehicle sections, however this time around you will get to take control of two interesting Transformers as well, each bringing their unique gameplay mechanics. The first one being Bruticus, the Decepticon combiner and the second one is Grimlock. As the giant Bruticus, you will be able to mow down hordes of attacking Autobots easily, while playing as Grimlock the game takes the hack-n-slash approach with an interesting rage-meter mechanics to trigger the T-rex transformation to wreck havok. Vehicle gameplay is still present, however for some reason the car driving sections of the game seem to be clunky and not so polished as they were in the previous game. Luckily there are not many of these segments. Aircraft controls work just fine though, when you play as Starscream and Vortex!\n\nGraphically Fall of Cybertron looks impressive and this time there is more variety in stages and you get to explore more open combat areas. The soundtrack gives the game an excellent boost in the atmosphere, while the voice actors truely deliver as well .\n\nOverall Fall of Cybertron is an excellent sequel and a worthy conclusion of the Cybertron saga.\nHighly recommended for any fans of Transformers  and anyone who loves TPS action games.\n\nPROS: - Amazing  story with very well paced, varied gameplay.\n- Wide range of playable robots including ’rare’ ones such as Grimlock and Bruticus.\n- Excellent graphics.\n- Great soundtrack and top-notch voice acting.\n\nCONS: - Car driving mechanics don’t work as well as they did in the prequel.\n- Minor bugs preventing progression. They can be fixed easily by reloading checkpoints.\n- Unchangeable key bindings.\n- Lack of challenge. The game is pretty easy even on highest difficulty.\n- Missions are significantly shorter compared to the stages of War for Cybertron.\n- Eventhough the game is about a total war between the Transformers, you will mostly be going alone as AI companion appear very seldom in this game.\n- Cutscene videos are in 480p.","February 15, 2015","true","22.2"," 35 of 39 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","35","39","0","0"

PC multiplayer also a 9/10. Controls are all good, no mouse acceleration issues (COD), the game was ported nicely to PC. Thumbs up to highmoon studios.\nBack when multiplayer was alive, this game was absolutely wonderful in that regard. There was a nice skill gap that wasn't too harsh if you get what I mean. After I primed and started my ranking over from zero again, I could still destroy people with my character because I was far more experienced and skilled in the game than my opposiiton, no matter what level they were or what high level abilities and guns they used.\nThe great thing about this games multiplayer is that it's like CSGO and COD Advanced Warfare met halfway with the skill gap. It wasn't just a run around and hope for a kill kind of arcade shooter, but it also wasn't down to the memorizing the map flow and gun recoil patterns either. The placement of the skill gap was set perfectly to where if you could manuever your character well enough, go for some headshots and be a hard target to hit, you would win everyone 1v1 fight. With enough of a drop on the enemy, I could 1v2 two destroyers or tanks with my scout class. It was just a matter of skill.\n\nSo all in all, 10/10 campaign, and 9/10 multiplayer (would be 10/10 if you could change your keyboard/controller buttons)\nThis game honestly deserves the popolarity and longevity of Call of Duty. I'm not asking for TF Fall of Cybertron 6, like the repititous COD titles, but I wish the community for this game lasted like COD4. There is absolutely nothing better than the feeling of transforming your custom made character in-game and flying/driving around in-game.\nAs said before, I 100% recommend this game to fulfill your singleplayer transformers needs, but if you came for the multiplayer... I'm sorry to say I do not recommend because it is long gone. R.I.P.

I will not be denied!" shouts Megatron as he sucked into the wormhole that will transport him and his nemesis, Optimus Prime, to Earth. Meanwhile I am laughing my ♥♥♥ off thanks to the excellent and wonderful delivery of the line.\n\nFall of Cybertron is a cartoon game at heart. Despite all its masked brutality and complicated linguo, it still is just a series of escapades, played out by rightly coloured robots that can transform into a variety of vehicles. And this is fine. Because, saturday morning Transformers are the transformers we have come to love. Fall of Cybertron then is a modern take on the cartoon; a streamlined version of it, that does away with the thick layer of moral correctness and exchanges it for witty humour and flashy action. Perfect for the crowd of today.\n\nHowever, this is not a cartoon. This is a game. A short game, I will admit, but a fun one. Fall of Cybertron is fast and varied. It is a third-persoon shooter with vehicle elements. It is a mix of speed and finesse that is fun to play and to watch. The campaign puts you in the armour of a different Transformer in every stage, while the mulitplayer mode allows you to build your own and take the fight to those pesky autobots or decepticons. The story mode is about 10 stages long and chronicles the final days of Cybertron. For those of you who are unfamilliar with Transformers lore, here is the synopsis: Cybertron is out of power and the decepticons still want more. When they hear the Autobots are preparing to leave the planet they attack to steal all their fuel so they can advance their goals of galactic conquest. Everything is delivered by a top-of-the-bill voicecast that holds nothing back to create a genuine Transformers experience.\n\nThe game does know a few shortcomings however. It is short. The campaign won't take much effort for a seasoned gamer and the split between vehicle and robot is a bit arbitrary at times. It comes down to preference in what mode you'd prefer to play, but some stages can be blitzed with little to no effort if you just tote the main gun from your Tank transformation. Multiplayer suffers from its regular slow-start hiccups. Everyone is level 40 and has planet destroyers while you try to make due with your slingshot and balloon shield. It is a hurdle, and since the rewards are always less appetising than the stuff you can unlock through purchacing DLC you might end up wondering if it is actually worth the time investment.\n\nI would sign off with a "Transform and Roll Out!" joke, but since this game doesn't have any real cars (they're all hovermobiles) it would seem out of place. So I return to my first sentence: "I will not be denied!" If this game comes up in a sale, shell some cash, and play some of this sweet robot action.","February 21, 2014","true","18.7"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

This is a must-have for any Transformer fan. And even if you're not a fan or not interested in the lore, the gameplay will definitely keep you interested. As like any Transformer game, you have to make good use of both robot and vehicle forms while using a vast array of weapons to achieve your goal in both the singleplayer campaign and the multiplayer or escalation modes.\n\nBest thing about Fall of Cybertron is definitely the story itself. Fans would recongize many easter eggs from the entire franchise here and there in the game. Voice-acting is top-notch, you can't doubt Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime. As for the other voices, they are quite close to the original cartoon series in the 80s although I admit I don't like Shockwave's voice. The plot itself is really good but it is way too short. A playthrough on Normal would probably take 10 hours average, maybe even shorter if you're not the exploring type.\n\nOther than that, well, you get to play as Grimlock for one mission and a half (best part of the singleplayer campaign). Nothing beats being a massive, fire-breathing T-Rex with plenty of rage. Fan or not, buy it.

This is a pretty good game. The story is top notch for Transformers. It's interesting without being overly complex or trying to be something more than it is. The co-op is gone, making the campaign more story driven, though this makes the campaign seem gimmicky at times. The ability to buy and upgrade your weapons is a really nice feature.\n\nThe graphics are really detailed. Transformers have a nice glossy look. The locations are more varied. The music is pretty epic and times and always sets the mood for the action. The voice acting is great.\n\nThe Escalation or "horde" mode is remade and well done. The waves only go to 15 but you have multiple tries to complete, which MAY make it to easy for some, but there is always hard mode. Everyone in the lobby can choose their own difficulty without effecting everyone else.\n\nNow we get to where most people spend their time on this game. Multiplayer. This game has some SERIOUS balance issues. There's always something over powered and annoying you have to deal with. And the players are VERY annoying. Everything from kill stealers and campers (on the convoy map ALL you ever see are jets camping at the top) and the heavy classes dominate everything. This game is just not suited for competitive play. If you want a good competitive game, go for War for Cybertron. The PvP in this game is just for joking around.\n\nI give this game a 7/10.

It is story-driven game, but the story is better than any Michael Bay's scrap and on the same level as Transformers: Prime tv show (just a little bit darker).  It's more like revamped classic Transformers from 80's. The design of transformers is high and resembles G1 design. Voice over is just 10/10.\nThere are tons of fun in multiplayer. You can create your own Autobot or Decepticon from available parts. Unfortunately you can't pick a side in multiplayer, the game does that for you to balance teams. Sometimes it chooses Autobot side which is so beneath me and defies my logic. Though when you host Escalation mode you can pick a side. In this mode you can choose any iconic transformer like Lord Megatron himself.\nIf you are only after the story, you can just watch walkthrough on youtube as the story is pretty much linear and you literally watch it like a movie. But if you want to play multiplayer, it's by far the best Transformers multiplayer experience out there.\nYou wanna know why I like this game?

Transformers FOC (Fall of Cybertron) is a transformers game set in the last days of Cybertron. The story follows multiple characters that are all leading into the main plot, this was an amazing idea and I love it <3 Now keep in mind everything I tell you is entirely coming from a Transformers fan. So, first off, let's start with the story. The story I found really intresting, I think most Transformers fans can agree with me that the story was really intresting. The graphics are okay, this is fine by me, all I came for was to be a Transformer (You might not be so okay as I was with the graphics if you're not a fan of the franchise) . The Story also expands about the origins about the Dinobots, eventually letting you become the all and mighty Grimlock. You also learn more about the other Dinobots origins, Swoop,Snarl, Slag, and Sludge. The bad thing about this is that you can only be Grimlock and Grimlock has a restriction on his transformation, ( I call ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t) correct me if I'm wrong but I don't recall there ever being a restriction on Grimlocks transformation. You play on both sides of the fight, (Autobots and Decepticons) . This was a good idea for fans of both Transformers. The car turning is slightly too stiff, and could use some work! It took me just under 7 hours to complete the Campaign, (according to Steam) . You play as some of the all time favourite and most hated characters, along with a few characters that will surprise you. The ♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing is that in some places I could drop under 10 fps, this isn't a thing that should put you off the game as it only happend for a few seconds, the places where the fps dropped weren't exactly action packed either. I have a GTX 760 ti, and a Intel core I5, (if you were wondering) . You can also not rebound the keys, (there is a different layout button with a few layouts, but you should be able to rebind keys) . The Multiplayer is also very, very good, (when it isn't kicking you or the host) . Sometimes it randomly kicks a few people along with the host. I once was in a game and it was full, I got to level 5, then the host was migrated, it took every one but me and another player out of the game. I lost my rank, and left.\n\nPros -\nGood story (opinion)\nMultiple Characters\nVoice acting\nIt's fun. Like, a lot of fun.\nAnimations (mainly transformation animation) .\nCombat feels nice and is enjoyable\nFlight controls\nThe Ending is really good! (opinion)\nStealth chapter was really fun! (opinion)\nEscalation mode\nMultiplayer is fun (when you get it working)\nMultiplayer customization\n\n\nCons -\nFrames drop sometimes\nLack of graphics options\nCan't rebind keys\nAnnoying kicking glitches online\nPoor host picking\nLoose ends on story\nCo-op is gone :(\nStiff turning controls on cars\n\n\nStuff they should add in the newest game -\nLonger story\nMore Transformers\nFix Multiplayer bugs and problems\nA few more stealth chapters\nMake a better quality PC Port\nSteam trading cards!!\n\nCheck out my Steam Curator group for more game recommendations and random topics!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jonathanl/recommended/213120/","jonathanl","Loud Howard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jonathanl/","800 products in account","Just a warning going into this release, I was a pretty big fan of Transformers going into this game. Although, if this had a completely different subject to it I don't think it would be any less of a great narrative. As compared to War of Cybertron, where you have a linear narrative of all autobots, then all deceptacons where you get to play as your favorite 'con (between the 3 given) done in a team of 3 in a basic third person shooter style seen in many other games before it. The game was alright. Then this game was revealed, and they changed everything. It's still a linear first person shooter yeah, but they changed up the way they did the narrative. Instead of picking a 'con, you're given the one for the job, with each having a unique ability set to go well with the mission you use them in. An assault on a base? Here's Megatron with a cannon. A mission where you're suggested to take a sneaky approach, here's Cliff Jumper with a stealth ability. Sniping? Here's Jazz with a grapple and sniper rifle; and it just goes on from there. This allows for a much more diverse level setup than War did and it shows. You go from the surface of Cybertron, to deep underground, to out in deep space all in the span of a 8-10 hour campaign, and that's if you don't seek out collectibles for 100% completion. I do want to make mention of the music. I really didn't think a game like this would be able to pull off good cinematic music the way it does, but it surprised me in that department. There's also multiplayer, but that really wasn't all that great. I played 1-2 hours of the multiplayer, and it's nothing special. You got your horde mode, you got your team deathmatch and a few other versus modes, but it'd be like almost any other third person shooter with a tacked on multiplayer, and really I'm going to take some points off of my score for that. I feel they could have added a bit more to the single player and polished it just a bit more if they didn't include the multiplayer. Overall I would say the game is an 8/10. If you like a good linear narrative and enjoy giant killer robots, than this is worth a look.","May 31, 2013","true","11.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Duskspark/recommended/213120/","Duskspark","Duskspark","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Duskspark/","484 products in account","I never really got the chance to get into the Transformers universe. As a kid I grew up with Pokémon and Yu-Gi-Oh!, but Transformers wasn't that popular here in Belgium (apart from the Michael Bay explosionfest). With Transformers™: War for Cybertron being released a few years ago, I was quite impressed with both the visual style of Cybertron and the fluid controls. Transformers™: Fall of Cybertron only adds upon that... most of the time.\n\nThe Pros:\n· Solid third-person shooter controls. There are no cover mechanics or anything out of the ordinary, but being able to transform into a vehicle (jets, racecars, tanks...) and the very solid dashing, you can evade enemy fire in a spectacular way.\n· A great single player story with great action-packed environments and a constantly thrilling war.\n· The Escalation co-op mode is especially fun. Choose your Transformer (Autobot or Decepticon, depending on the map) with its own special ability to survive 15 waves of increasingly more difficult enemies. The more communication there is with your party, the easier it'll be to survive.\n· An overall good difficulty curve. The AI is rather smart and getting into the open, even on Normal difficulty, is an almost certain death. It takes some time to get used to, but you'll quickly master and finetune your tactics for both Singleplayer, Escalation and the Multiplayer.\n\nThe Cons:\n· There's a bit too little co-operation in my opinion. Escalation is great but it doesn't last forever, and the Singleplayer can't be played in co-op anymore as in War for Cybertron. The co-op experience was the most fun I've had in the game, and quite possibly in any recetly played third person shooters, but it feels a bit underused and forgotten.\n· Multiplayer is dead. You'll find people playing TDM for sure, but there's a chance you might find hackers. I also find the multiplayer a bit lacking in its predecessor.\n\nThe Visuals:\n· Great combinations of technical advancement and neon bring the world of Cybertron to life in a spectacular sci-fi way.\n\nFinal Verdict:\n· A lot of attention was spent on the singleplayer and it shows, both in good and bad. A top notch enjoyable storyline, but co-op- and multiplayer-modes could have used some extra attention. 8/10\n","June 25, 2014","true","4.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I am a big transformers fan so my view is slightly biased.\n\n- Likes\nTransforming feels useful, your alt mode can actually do you a lot of good when you're using it correctly, just becareful if you try to transform to run away you'll more likely to end up dying.\n\nVaried weapons\n\nDecent health, I don't die a few seconds after I spawn like battlefield.\n\nGreat voice acting,\n\nSoundtrack is amazing partiulary the map room, sadly not included in the soundtrack.\n\n- Dislikes\nThe flying modes while fast (which is what you need) work on a horizontal plane. So you can go up and down but you can't go upside down. Many of the areas in the multiplayer map are cut off to you can you can end up getting jammed into objects which hit boxes are just badly designed. So much more could have been down with this. Such as flying through vertical tight spaces.\n\nTransformation customisation is bad, while it takes a lot of work so much more could have been done to show customised parts in vehicle mode. Even so when you use the correct parts it's still looks quite tacky. Certian parts just look flat with textures place on top.  Still there's credit due with the complexity of these designs.\n\nDialouge seems somewhat tacky, (there is no greater sacrifice than in freedom) not the erxact words but OP says this and I think... well that's a bit extreme. How many are you willing to slauter till you're satified Prime?\n\nMultiplayer ocassionally have cheaters, also due to the nature of joining games you don't get to choose which match you're placed into. There's no system in place to ban them, so all you can do is leave the server and try and find another one. Or try to be a bad ♥♥♥ and take them on. It's rather satifying when you beat them, like taking on a boss batte.","June 16, 2015","true","188.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

Bigger, arguably better, and crammed with more of the stuff Transformers fans want - like Dinobots and Insecticons. The gameplay remains relatively unchanged, but there's a more linear nature to preceedings, doing away with optional three-player co-op and instead guiding players down a strict narrative. I find that this is an improvement - the story, I think, is worth sacrificing the nontheless appealing co-op features.\n\nMore Transformers goodness, made by honest-to-god Transformers fans, for Transformers fans, hooked along on shooter gameplay that is enjoyable in its own right. Transforming is as fun as it's ever been, and seeing familiar faces (and hearing familiar voices, and, at some points, seeing familiar scenes play out...!) is a masterful way of appealing to Gen X.","September 26, 2014","true","14.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Even I find this game amazing, and highly recommend it, once it goes on sale.\n\nSolid third person shooting WITHOUT a cover mechanic, a neat little upgrade system, dozens of interesting weapons, well designed interesting missions, some fun twists, all of this combines to make a rather solid video game. When you add in a co-op horde mode, and a rather fun little multiplayer diversion thats still going fairly strong on PC, it's a pretty nice package.\n\nThe only real issue I have with it is the price, $60 would be a little steep unless you are a hardcore Transformer fan, as it's only about 5 hours long, with little to no reason to replay it. Once it goes on sale however, it'd be a very solid buy.","October 1, 2012","true","6.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It's got a great story, ( Mainly because it doesn't have any continuity with the recent filmss. ) very smooth mechanics, great voice acting, high quality animations, and a very well balanced system between the use of your robot and alternate forms. The Multiplayer is great, with one of the best (mecha) character customization you'll get from any game. The different verity of forms that you can transform into is astounding, as you can have your character transform into a car, truck, jet, helicopter, insects and even a few dinosaurs.\n\nI do however recommend that you play the prequel, Transformers: War For Cybertron, before playing this. The game is relatively cheap at the moment and is worth the time and money to understand what is going on in this game.\n\nIf I had to recommed one set of DLC, I would buy the "Massive Fury Pack" as it has some extra weapons that is used for single player, and a few skin packs for Multiplayer, but It's not required to enjoy the game.\n\nOne of the best parts about the single player campage is that the there is an upgrade system that is carried over to the next character you play as in the story reguarless of who your playing as, with a few exceptions. ( For good reason. )\n\nIf I had to complain about one thing in the game, it is the final boss fight, as it was ridiculously difficult. ( But that might have been my fault since I played through the game on Hard from the start. )\n\nOther then that, great game over all. 8.5 out of 10. Highly recommended.","February 14, 2014","true","380.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The game itself is a complete throwback to the original G1 series. It's very clear that the developers of the game put their hearts and souls into making this game, and many references to the G1 series can be seen in this game, which is an excellent nod to the fans. Story-wise, the game takes place on a war-ravaged Cybertron, with both the Autobots and Decepticons competeing for Energon and power in order to take orbit. Almost every G1 character is represented in this game, and Peter Cullen reprises his role as Optimus Prime. The inclusion of the Dinobots instantly makes this game superior to War for Cybertron, which was alredy an excellent game itself. Metroplex makes an appearence, also, which was a great thing to see. All of the characters are true to their G1 selves, Honorable Optimus, Traitorus Starscream, King Grimlock etc. The entire game has solid voice acting, which is a great thing to see in a game like this. In terms of gameplay, it's very similar to War for Cybertron, but improves further upon that. The controlls, whilst un-customizable, work perfectly for Mouse and Keyboard. Also, it's worth noting that this is an excellent PC port. I played through the game at a constant 60 FPS @ 1080p, without experiencing any stuttering or crashes.\n\nOverall, I would definatley recommend Transformers: Fall fo Cybertron. It truly is an amazing thing to see a game that was made by Transformers fans, for Transformers fans.","August 1, 2014","true","10.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Yes\n\nFall of Cybertron surpasses it's predecessor in nearly ever aspect. Graphics are clean and rife with effects and explosives, and has a stronger color pallate. The fun factor from the gameplay is significanly higher, and all the missions are fun to play. The pacing is excellent and you get a good feel for both sides of the bots as well as a larger variety than the previous game. You're missing the option to choose your bot, making the game feel even more linear than before, but considering how inconsequential choice was in the last game and how much better the game is now that you jump between the sides, try completely different bot types including normal shooter levels, flight levels, stealth levels, platforming levels, and even get to play as Bruticus and Grimlock, as well as Optimius Prime with assistance from the humongous Metroplex. I don't miss it. I praised the voice acting from the previous game and it's just as good, if not better - you even get to hear Optimus and Megatron in the mutliplayer modes. The soundtrack is absolutely epic with some heavy rock themes and your typical "epic Latin Chanting Orchestral" tracks, but I love that stuff. However, the game is even more linear than before, cutscenes have a pointless input segment, requiring you to Press E to perform an action. It's only once a cutscene and has no failure state, so it might as well have been automated. Activating switches is a bit annoying as well, having to press E then hold S as if pulling a lever. Just make it "Press E" or "Hold E". Transforming feels even less necessary than the last game except for specific sequences, however, transforming is almost a more alternative weapons in most missions. Vehicles feel are faster than WFC and even includes Nitro. I used abilities alot more in this game than the last one, but that is mostly because they were required for progress - however, they are definitely much more improved than before, especially the plaftorming and smashing with Megatron's hover.\n\nI can't recommend it at full price though. Blame Activision's greediness for still wanting to charge full price for a game in a era where people wait for big sales and bundles. The game ends in roughly 10-12 hours and has no replay value beyond harder difficulties, replaying the last level sequence, and the typical shooter "collect the audio logs/blueprints/intel" (And the logs only play upon pick up - you can't replay them from the pause menu. Ubelievably incompetent move.) While on average about 100-300 people may be online according to Steam charts, it can be tough to find a multiplayer or Escalation game. I was able to get a few games on 06-08-14 (Saturday), but basically no games the next day.  I have played a couple rounds of multiplayer and it's an absolute blast going toe-to-toe as Transformers, blasting bots, chasing runners, or transforming and fleeing. I enjoyed Escalation at first, as I was getting the most kills and having fun destroying enemy bots, but there's pretty much no way you will be able to solo co-op unlike Mass Effect 3 and again, weapons, ammo and health IN BATTLE are all reliant on a money system and interacting with them while in combat. It seems like the only reliable way of getting online games is with friends/regular players or joining in when there is a spike of players. Oh, and there's no in game chat again.","June 8, 2014","true","13.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Sure I've watched a couple of episodes, but it just didn't hook me. Why? To this day I don't know. What's cooler than transforming robots? Not a lot. I suppose if it was anything, it'd be Starscream. He's the worst combination of everything. Incredibly unintelligent, self centered, fails at virtually everything he does, overconfident, acts like how an evil 10 year old would and has the absolute most annoying voice I have ever heard.\n\nSo if you couldn't tell.....I despise Starscream and I don't understand why he became a popular character. And it's the only reason I can think of for not watching the original Transformers show. However, I really enjoyed the game (even the Starscream part despite me hating him with a passion). It feels smoother than the first and allows you to play as more of the iconic characters. Unlocking upgrades to pulverize your enemies is fun and it was very unique playing as Bruticus and Grimlock.\n\nEscalation is just as fun as it is in War for Cybertron. Same with PvP. The only negatives I have is:\n-Definitely shorter than the original and I felt like the story was too rushed\n-Vehicle mechanics felt a little clunkier\n-While I knew High Moon announced they removed this because "it's too hard".....no co-op\n-Microtransactions\n-The ending didn't feel satisfying enough\n\nI definitely recommend this as it's a great sequel to WFC. If you haven't played either of them I would rather recommend the first title. I think it's an overall better experience.

The controls feel solid and responsive and the animation is well done. The graphics are aesthetically pleasing.\n\nThe single-player campaign provided a good challenge.

Also I can spend hours on end on the multiplayer maps and modes with all the different characters and customization so if you like transformers or haven't heard of them yet, you buy this game and you will learn why these robots are so famous and been around for so long!","June 27, 2014","true","20.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I get goosebumps when the money men in suits at Hasbro go "put this thing there to cause goosebumps!". I'm the perfect sucker for doing THAT THING with it. You know, that thing when they evoke the cartoon intro, or Optimus Prime says a thing.\n\nThese games - War for and Fall of Cybertron - are alright. They're super, mega alright. They're fun - with the occasional, more palpable wave of "hey this is fun!" washing over you. Ultimately, though, I'm left with the feeling that I'm not having the optimal good time. That's not really the game's fault. The part where it's a game, I mean. It's just... I dunno, it's hard to put your finger on.\n\nThey have some characterisation on the part of the robots, and they give you some fanservicy "hey, stomp things as Grimlock" moments in this game, but it all just seems kinda modest. Where are the nefarious plots, the in-fighting, the politics and the clashing ideologies? Maybe it's "too soon" to get that stuff out before they're even off the planet, but the result is a bit of a vacuum in the story and between the characters. As a game it's really everything it needs to be. Arcadey and blasty and transforming makes you feel good. It could just go wilder with *the other bits*.\n\nDo I recommend it? Oh, absolutely. It's the best Transformers time you'll have, currently. I just don't get why it isn't awesome.","January 2, 2014","true","8.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Crank it up to the highest graphics setting and you won't care so much about making adjustments, because apart from a couple of slow texture loads here and there this is a beautiful game. Transformers are covered in detail, just like last time, but where WfC was criticised for its muted colours and lacklustre landscapes, here we get eye-popping shines on Optimus' red and blue paintwork, and Megatron is deliciously evil in a murderous black and purple (though on the whole, the Decepticon colour palette is more muted than the Autobots', which is a shame), while they and their armies battle over magnificent Cybertronian vistas.\n\nCombat is a bit finicky here and there but good overall- there's a very meaty (metallic?) feel to FoC, a real weight to your robots, which lends to a real feeling of satisfaction as you storm positions and make use of a combination of guns, melee, abilities and gadgets to wipe out the enemy. Even your inventory is turned into a bit of a meta-game, with energon goodies scattered throughout the game that you can use to upgrade your guns. Upgrade a weapon three times and you unlock a final bonus with ludicous benefits- the Riot Cannon, for instance, ends up doing something like 500% its normal damage on the final shot in a clip (I might be misremembering the details, but that's the gist of it). These bonuses lend the later game a gratifying sense of power, and you can carve your way through the enemy with merry abandon. The only downside is vehicle mode- it's still fun, but, vehicle-specific sections aside, it's hard to see much benefit of transforming when control in robot mode is so much more precise. I still love swooping around as a flyer, transforming in mid-air, falling for a while and then transforming again before zooming away, but it's something you do because you think it's bloody cool, not because there's much gameplay benefit.\n\nMultiplayer consists of various competitive modes (team deathmatch, capture the flag, etc), and has a better Build Your Own Transformer system than the first, though as mentioned the colour palettes still leave a lot to be desired. In-game, you might find yourself running around a bit trying to find people in some of the larger maps, but on the whole the pace is fast and rewarding. Kill the enemy and support your team to level up and unlock more weapons, abilities and Transformer bodies to customise your classes (Scout, Destroyer, Titan and Scientist). Or, if you feel like playing a Horde mode, there's Escalation, where you choose from a selection of named Autobots or Decepticons to fight against wave after wave of enemies. Kills are rewarded with energon points, which you can use to buy weapons, health, upgrades or to open up new areas of the map. It gets punishingly difficult, especially without four players.\n\nIn summary, because this has got a bit long: forget the Michael Bay nonsense. There are more loving nods towards what you remember from the original G1 cartoon in FoC than I suspect we will ever see in the entire movie franchise, and the care and attention that has gone into making this is obvious. As a massive Transformers fan, it's this that wins me over more than anything. The fact that it's a really fun game underneath helps, of course!","May 8, 2014","true","23.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Micheal Bay completely disappointed me with his films. Even Peter Cullen saying "I am Optimus Prime" couldn't redeem those movies for me. But along came High Moon studios, and War for Cybertron. And it was fantastic. Still had Peter Cullen, but Peter Cullen playing the Optimus Prime I knew and loved of my childhood. It was a fantastic game. Great action, great charecters, great set piece moments with "OMG NO WAY IS THAT" recollections of favorite charecters appearing. It was great.\n\nHow could a sequel compare? Well, Fall of Cybertron takes a great game, and dials it up even further. This takes all the stuff that made the last game great, and adds to them. It gives you more great moments, and amps them up. Using metroplex to waste an Deceptacon army, or playing as a combiner against the autobots, they're just so many points where any transformers nerd would be gitty about.\n\nThe charecters once again are still amazing, and we add several more to the game. If I had one complaint, I suppose it might be I dont get to play as my favorites all the time, but then, I would miss out on some of these other great moments and charecters, so that complaint falls a bit short. Fan favorites all over the game, this really is a love letter to Transformers.\n\nGameplay once again, they added more to it to make an even better game than the first. I mentioned those charecters, well High Moon has done an amazing job making all of those charecters play very differently. From a juggernaught that lays waste to all before it, to a stealth charecter sneaking around and assinated enemy bots, or a bionic commando like grappler who moves all around the play area. It is just fantastic, and a lot of fun.\n\nAnd the story is great. No, we are not talking Oscar winning great, but as a Transformer story, it is a cut above anything Micheal Bay is giving, and honestly well above plenty of other games out there. It pays homage to the source material while giving a unique story set in the Transformers universe. It is just entertaining.\n\nThe game also has multiplayer, but honestly, I havnt touched it. The solo game is more than enough to warrent a purchase.","October 13, 2015","true","9.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mvalles19/recommended/213120/","mvalles19","TheCrimsonGhost","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mvalles19/","317 products in account","High Moon Studio’s retelling of the Transformers’ escape from their dying planet Cybertron was left unfinished in 2010’s Transformers: War for Cybertron. In its sequel, Transformers: Fall of Cybertron, continues the story of the Autobot/Decepticon civil war, reintroduces familiar characters from the cartoon series, and delivers the action-packed gameplay of the original – with a few changes.\n\nFall of Cybertron takes place directly after the events of the previous game, with Optimus and the Autobots preparing their deep-space ship, known as the Ark, for evacuation from the mechanical planet. The campaign is structured differently from the previous title. Instead of two separate campaigns – Autobot and Decepticon – as seen in the prior game, Fall of Cybertron takes you through a single storyline that alternates between the two sides. For instance, in one mission, you’ll play as Optimus Prime as he attempts to secure Energon resources for the Ark’s evacuation. In the next, you’ll take control of the Decepticon, Vortex, as he sabotages the Autobot transport carrying that same Energon supply. You’ll see both sides of the conflict firsthand, which is great for those who enjoyed the dual perspective of the first game. But that’s not all that’s changed.\n\nFall of Cybertron forgoes the three-player co-op from the previous title, which in turn, negates the ability to choose the character you play in each level. You no longer have two companion characters following you around. Instead, characters like Jazz will move about the background, guide you through levels, and keep up the banter as you stealthily infiltrate a Decepticon base as the mission’s designated Autobot, Cliffjumper. Each level is crafted with the transformer’s abilities in mind. In some missions, you’ll play as Optimus with a heavy emphasis on shooting or you’ll do some platforming as the acrobatic Jazz, while others let you take to the skies as Starscream in amazing aerial/ground hybrid levels.\n\nEach level type is fun in its own right. The shooting sections are solid, stealth missions go without a hitch, and aerial assaults are a blast. However, the melee-focused Dinobot section of the campaign is far from enjoyable. Rather than running into battle guns blazing, firing off missile launchers, and transforming at a moment’s notice to rain-down a bombardment of explosives on enemy lines, you’re forced to continuously mash the melee button and watch the same combo animation over and over, as you wail on Insecticons. The entire section was completely out of place and drags on for far too long. Even the instant ability to transform is taken away in exchange for a rage meter that (once filled) allows you to activate your T-Rex form.\n\nOverall, the gameplay feels tighter and more focused. However, the inability to play as or interact with a larger roster of characters is disappointing. You’ll see plenty of familiar characters, like Ironhide and Shockwave, but you won’t be able to interact with most of them in more than a short dialogue exchange. It is also a missed opportunity that the more prominent characters don’t play boss roles to fill the overall lack of boss battles. Instead, you’re stuck fighting generic, larger-than-usual transformers as they show up as “sort-of” mini-bosses to replace the massive boss encounters of the first game.\n\nAfter you finish the campaign, the multiplayer and Escalation modes provide a great reason to come back to Fall of Cybertron. Not much has changed from War for Cybertron’s multiplayer, but engaging giant robots in a gun battle is just as fun as before. Successful kills and captured objectives earn experience points to unlock more weapons and upgrades, and you can customize your Autobot and Decepticons with armor parts to make them stand out from the crowd.\n\nEscalation – the Transformers version of Horde mode – is especially addicting. Players face wave after wave of hostile transformers. You’ll choose from four character classes, each with unique support abilities including a projectile absorbing Flak Shield, Heal Beam, automated Battle Sentry, or the ammo replenishing Ultra-Power Core. When you get a kill in Escalation, you earn money, which you can use to purchase weapons, activate traps, and open doors to access new sections of the map. The enemies come out in droves, so sticking with your team and devising and effective battle strategy is the only way to survive.\n\nTransformers: Fall of Cybertron is a solid action experience with a few issues that hold it back from greatness. The story campaign entertains and the multiplayer modes entice you to come back after the credits roll, but the out-of-place melee segments, polish issues, and dropped features from the first game make it fall short. If you’re a Transformers super fan looking for more giant robot action or just looking for a fun shooter experience, Transformers: Fall of Cybertron will not disappoint.\n","January 7, 2014","true","12.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you were a fan of the cartoons as a child (and hated the Michael Bay rendition) then this is the game for you.

Where this game shines though is in its multiplayer. Take this with a grain of salt - there have been hackers sighted in the multiplayer matches but most games are hacker free. If you played the orginal War for Cybertron, you know what you are in for. Fast paced action, awesome combat, decent story, great voiceovers and musical score.

It features fully customizable autobots and decepticons as well as a great singleplayer campaign. Multiplayer is where this series shines though and unfortunately the company, Dark Moon Studios, missed out on a very key few elements that could've taken this game to the max which I'll explain.\n\nThe graphics in this game are outstanding and definitely show the hard work that DM as put into this title. Autobots and Decepticons transform formidably and keep their focus true to the series. Environments are much more colorful and open since the last release and feature an equal playing field similar to the last yet the maps are MUCH smaller than the last and there is not as many.\n\nGameplay has changed immensily for the worst. In the previous title, War of Cybertron, you used to be able to fling your autobot across the map, transform in mid-air and strike your opponent down or away into the air. THIS WAS AMAZING and added a very slick/cool feeling. Autobots and Decepticons feel very heavy and slow in FOC (Fall of Cybertron) which take away from the twitch effective gameplay from before.\n\nVoice acting is, again, amazing.\n\nDarkmoon Studios is renown for their inability to speak to their community. They are clearly treating Transformers as a backround project which is a huge mistake. It would be best to release this license to a development team who will actually work passionately on each release rather than just making a game...selling it to the public...and forgetting about it. I have yet, in the 3-4 years I've owned both games, to see a developer response on the forums.\n\nThis game is amazing for diehards of the series but DM has killed the multiplayer for this game. If you want THE BEST multiplayer experience, purchase War of Cybertron.","September 26, 2013","true","23.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The Autobot's last hope for saving their race is to launch the Ark through a portal to a distant planet until the planet is able to 'reboot' itself. Of course, the Decepticons don't plan on going down with the ship, and resent the idea of someone leaving them behind.\nIf you were a fan of the 80's cartoon, this game, more or less, leads RIGHT into that show, minus a few continuity errors. (in the show, Wheeljack 'invented' the Dinobots, Starscream 'invented' the Combaticons; but in the game both groups are already frontline forces). None of that matters though.\nBypassing WFC's class-based system, FoC has character-based levels, with each level showcasing the talents of that Character's level, from Optimus Prime's Run-and-Gun levels, Cliffjumper's stealth levels (which I loved), Jazz's 'speed sniper' levels, or Bruticus' "DESTROY IT ALL" levels.\nThe story is told very well, and the game is amazing. My only complaints are that some playstyles were a little more fun than others (again, I loved Cliffjumpers stealth sequences, didn't care so much for Vortex's 'fly here, destroy that' sequence). The biggest complaint I had while playing was that the Teletran1 upgrade screens didn't 'work' with the control pad, and I was required to use the mouse and keyboard to navigate that segment of the game, meaning I couldn't just run this on TV in Big-Pic mode. Acceptable for the quality of the game.\nAll in all, I recommend it.

The game feels different to it's predecessor WFC in the sense of its improved interaction with the environment (i.e. the stylish abilities unique to each character in each mission) as well as weapon upgrades. Let me summarise it for you.\n\nPros:\n*The storyline is epic and includes my most favourite transformer characters of all time (Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Soundwave and Grimlock along with a load more) and really digs into the lore that makes up the Transformers universe and the events that lead up to the G1 tv series (for any of you that don't know what that means, Google's there to help).\n*The weapons are fun and great to combo with (cycling from vehicle mode to robot mode to unleash hell on some puny decepticons while I laugh like a sadistic maniac.)\n*2 Words - GRIMLOCK. DINOBOTS. Enough said.\n*The multiplayer was tons of fun before it got shut down by December last year (such a shame High Moon couldn't keep it going) you could customize your own transformers from 4 different classes (Scout, Destroyer, Tank and Scientist) with tons of abilities/weapons/paint jobs to choose from.\n\n(Decepti) Cons:\n*The multiplayer along with escalation shutting down - if they hadn't this wouldn't be on my cons list, they were that good.\n*The lack of missions for bigger characters (i.e. Grimlock only has 2 missions in the entire game and is never seen again until you buy a dlc pack that adds his t-rex vehicle mode in multiplayer) It would've been so cool if you could play him in more missions or have him as a playable character for most of them (even though he'd probably be way too op for it!)","March 31","true","140.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

It's the better game between the two, honestly. But it's short. Even shorter than the first one. And while there's a multiplayer component in it (please note: unlike the first one there's no co-op in this one, though), €50 is a hefty price to pay for such a short experience. I'll admit; there's more variation in the missions this time and the graphics are more colorful and diverse (it looks stunning in motion), it still all comes down to shooting down other robots, and occasionally transforming. It truly is a shame, because the missions where you have to use stealth and grapple around the environments are pretty cool. I wish every mission had a different gameplay element, because there's just so many Transformers. Back in the day when the TV show was still on the air I knew most of these characters. Now I have a hard time distinguishing them.\nIf you're a fan, grab it.

When you are a true fan of something, especially something from your childhood, these "new products" usually leave you either angry or upset. When we live in a world with people like Michael Bay who seem to take pleasure from killing peoples childhood, you force yourself to forget about your fandom just to avoid the pain. I so very thankful that High Moon does the opposite. They know EXACTLY what a true Transformers fan wants. Every little detail in this game (and the first) complement Transformers and make me a much bigger fan than I ever was. After just completing the game my first thought was the possibility of having a g1 marathon. When I was starting this I was a little afraid, I loved the first one so much and one of the biggest reasons for that was the co-op was fantastic. Sadly in this one they took it out to have a more focused campaign. However the more I played, the less I missed it. Yeah the co-op in the first was great but they did such a great job replacing it with a incredible single player focused campaign. Bottom line: This is a game made for the real Transformers fans, fan service done perfectly. If nothing in this recommendation has enticed you, the final mission might be the best one I have ever played.","February 10, 2013","true","18.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You have all your beloved TS characters from their vanila G1, excluding the Bay factor.\n\nHowever... As a game, is it worth it?\n\nNow this review is completely unbiased, I grew up around Transformers, TNMT etc. but I am not a raging, mega TS fan.\nThat being said, the game iteself has a interesting campaign, structured in episodes, and the good thing is that almost all the time you are doing something different. Be it playing with a grapling hook, slashing away with Grimlock or nuking everything with the giant Metroplex. It has it all, and it is respectfully long enough.\n\nHowever multiplayer is not the good side of FoC, and here's why:\n\n- Stupid leveling sytem with locked weapons and abilities, the most annoying thing in a TPS for me.\n- This way you must grind and get your ♥♥♥ wooped by higher level.... "classes" which have the good stuff, while you are trying just to stay alive in the battlefield\n- It has some kind of Call of Duty influence that I don't like\n- Some gimmicky maps that can be exploited\n- And now, the worst part:\nHACKERS!\nYup, this game is crawling with hacking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that ruin games with reload hacks or whatever else hack.\nIt is annoying. No VAC protection and Activision being the typicall ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, money hungry, ♥♥♥♥ed up corporation with assholish suits, does not care as any support for this game is dropped and you really get the feeling you are playing a forgoten game. Overall one of the worst multiplayers, because of the hackers and lack of support, and by the sheer fact, no one plays the other modes, so you're stuck with team DM.\nThere is also an escalation mode which is very similar to Mass Effect 3's multi mode. Wave/kill all, wave/kill all. Repeat. Can be fun sometimes, and hell others.\n\nOverall, buy this game on a sale, like I did. Otherwise, for the asking price, you WILL get the buyer's remorse.\n\n7/10","November 18, 2014","true","17.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

People that own the game from the start report that they can access the MP but the rest of us can't and even worst... the publisher doesn't even respond to support messages.\n\nSpending the full price amount (~50€) is completely insane and buying any DLC that applies to MP is a waste of money. If they ever fix it I would get it during a sale.

The set pieces are huge and it feels just like Cybertron should; the combat & weapons are also much improved from its predecessor, Transformers: War for Cybertron.\nPlaying as many of the iconic transformers feels just right and unlike the first game they all have different abilities so it no longer feels like you're playing the same transformer over and over again which was my biggest gripe with War for Cybterton. Also the moments where you get to control Bruticus and Grimlock are a BLAST and feel just like you hoped they would way back when we only had the cartoons to entertain us. Ah, memories + nostalgia. brb watching Transformers The Movie again :D\nAny self-respecting transformer fan would do well to GET THIS GAME NOW! :P\n\n9/10","January 2, 2013","true","12.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is something worth noting if you're going to listen to my opinion, because I've heard some of the more hardcore fans debate the game's merits in terms of the lore, but for me, well, I freakin' loved this game.\n\nYou have lots of different robots, fast paced action, lots of explosions and laser beams, and a continous stream of strife and chaos that is utterly joyous to be a part of. The game advertises a war between Autobots and Decepticons and you most definitely get that. Although there is some mild repetitivess in some chunks of the game that overstay their welcome you are overall getting a fairly polished (especially by Console-to-PC port standards) third person shooter. The constant swapping of playable characters keeps introducing new gimmicks and abilities to each gameplay segment, freshening up the experience and ensuring excellent pacing as the story unfolds.\n\nMaybe it doesn't quite reach high enough to stand out amongst the crowded sea of shooters out there, but it hits enough of the right notes to ensure that if you're even a casual Transformers fan you're going to have a blast.","November 4, 2014","true","12.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The campaign features a variety of well-known characters from the Transformers franchise, with an emphasis on G1 characters and personalities. Although you cannot choose your character (each chapter has one specific character you play) and there is no co-op, each chapter is tailored to suit the character you are playing; Optimus Prime can call in artillery strikes, and so has levels with large battlefields. Cliffjumper can cloak, so his level supports a stealthy approach, and so on. Despite being a planet made entirely of metal, Cybetron contrives to have several varied environments, which helps to make the game feel less same-y.\n\nCombat is primarily of a third-person-shooter format; the player can carry one primary weapon and one Heavy weapon at a time, and is further armed with their vehicle mode's weapon. Players can transform at any time and the different vehicle modes each have varying levels of mobility and firepower. An unexpected (but highly useful) feature is the ability to change which hand your character shoots from, and thusly which shoulder the camera hovers over. This is much better than the previous game (and many other third-person shooters), where you would be forced to rely on taking cover on the left side of a battlefield.\n\nAlthough the game's campaign in itself is a marvel, its multiplayer is also highly enjoyable; players have access to four character "classes"; Infiltrator (Car), Destroyer (Truck), Titan (Tank) and Scientist (Jet). Each class has a choice of two special abilities and four weapons, each with three optional perk upgrades. Furthermore, there is a wealth of cosmetic customisation, with each character skin in the game available to players to mix and match parts, which are purchased through in-game currency. Because it is not possible to purchase weapons or perks in this way, there is no "pay to win" aspect at all. This includes the DLC, which only unlocks more character skins.\n\nHowever, the multiplayer has some problems; there is no in-game chat or voice chat, there are no dedicated servers (which can result in frequent Host Migration issues, although thankfully not as bad as at launch) and the game is open to exploitation by hackers. Thankfully, in my recent multiplayer matches, encounters with hackers have been rare, but they do still happen. Finally, the game's playerbase is very small, and the only mutliplayer mode that sees frequent use is Team Deathmatch.\n\nThe third game mode is Escalation, where a team of four players fight increasingly dangerous waves of enemies. Each map has a specific set of four characters with specific abilities. I would have liked the option to bring your customised multiplayer character into Escalation (much like WH40K: Space Marine's Exterminatus mode), but it is a minor complaint.\n\nIn terms of graphics and sound design, this game is beautiful if you can appreciate its heavy sci-fi aesthetic. Peter Cullen reprises his role as Optimus Prime, along with the other voice actors from War for Cybertron. Greg Berger also returns as Grimlock, albeit not using exactly the same voice and mannerisms.\n\nAll-in-all, if you are a Transformers fan then you should definitely buy this game. If you are not a fan, but still want a decent third-person-shooter experience, then I would still recommend it. It is sadly still priced at £30, but is occasionally put on sale. I would advise picking it up at half-price or less if at all possible, but struggle to recommend a full-price purchase.\n\nTL:DR Version;\n\nPros:\n-Transforming robots.\n-Explosions.\n-Guns.\n-Fancy graphics.\n-Nice multiplayer customisation\n\n(Decepti)Cons:\n-Small playerbase.\n-Occasional cheaters/hackers in multiplayer\n-Bit expensive at full price\n\nTransform and roll out!","June 24, 2014","true","52.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The world is very detailed and feels... I can't really describe it in a word but... again how old games managed to pull off immersion by putting you in the set pieces, making the world feel alive by doing more than just ploping a column of smoke and sounds of gunfire off in the distance.\n\nHealth doesn't just magically regenerate and you'll die relatively fast if you're stupid. The weapons feel pretty good and overall the gameplay is simply good and the campaign is pretty well paced.\n\nHowever multiplayer seems to be all but alive, its pretty much impossible to find a match later in the evening but you can manage to find a few in the late morning or afternoon. Also, all of the DLC seems to apply to multiplayer and its mostly just a bunch of cosmetics. Buy it at your own risk as multiplayer seems like it could die off any day at this rate but it is enjoyable.\n\nBetween the reviews I've seen and my limited experience I'd say its worth grabbing on sale but definitely not for the ridiculous standard release price. The only real negative about this game really is that not many people play it, though overall in itself it is a good game.","March 13, 2013","true","10.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Jumping around, dashing back and forth, while launching everything from rockets, streams of lightning, grenades, electrified harpoons, and the always reliable bullet into the faceplate of  whatever stands, floats, drives, flys, or so forth between you and your goal is immensely satisfying.\n\nIf this game looks interesting to you, I would go for it.

One (bad point) is that they take the simple combat system that the original had and add some pseudo-roleplay aspects such as adding an in-game store where you can buy perks and upgrades and items for the game.  Not to mention they distribute all these containers all around the battle field that you open for 250 of the currency and its a roulette as to what to get.\n\nThe story picks up after the events for War for Cybertron and does a good job at giving explanation to how the transformers struggle to leave Cybertron. Good thing is Dark Energon is more or less thrown out as a plot device and barely mentioned.\n\nThe Autobots and Decepticon storylines are a little more fleshed out and we get to see several familiar faces (being Grimlock and the Dinobots to name a few) and names being added to it.\n\nThe problem is that not only do we see that we also see a little fan service in the game as well that pushes the story into independent of the cartoons for generation 1 and that's something I was not really happy to see. The story also does the standard recounting of events that got us to the start of the game then at the end continuing on from there till the climax.\n\nOne thing I liked was the more fleshed out independent stories of the characters in the game it was fun seeing from their perspectives as you played you do get the feel for how they do things. And obviously as a transformers game explosions are abound in the area so you get a sense of the war being brutal to a point.\n\nOverall I would say this game is worth getting when its on sale but not when its not its a nice fun short game,\n\n(This game is easier to control with a keyboard and mouse then with a gamepad oddly enough.. if you do aim to use one remapping the keys is recommended)","January 4, 2014","true","9.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

One (bad point) is that they take the simple combat system that the original had and add some pseudo-roleplay aspects such as adding an in-game store where you can buy perks and upgrades and items for the game.  Not to mention they distribute all these containers all around the battle field that you open for 250 of the currency and its a roulette as to what to get.\n\nThe story picks up after the events for War for Cybertron and does a good job at giving explanation to how the transformers struggle to leave Cybertron. Good thing is Dark Energon is more or less thrown out as a plot device and barely mentioned.\n\nThe Autobots and Decepticon storylines are a little more fleshed out and we get to see several familiar faces (being Grimlock and the Dinobots to name a few) and names being added to it.\n\nThe problem is that not only do we see that we also see a little fan service in the game as well that pushes the story into independent of the cartoons for generation 1 and that's something I was not really happy to see. The story also does the standard recounting of events that got us to the start of the game then at the end continuing on from there till the climax.\n\nOne thing I liked was the more fleshed out independent stories of the characters in the game it was fun seeing from their perspectives as you played you do get the feel for how they do things. And obviously as a transformers game explosions are abound in the area so you get a sense of the war being brutal to a point.\n\nOverall I would say this game is worth getting when its on sale but not when its not its a nice fun short game,\n\n(This game is easier to control with a keyboard and mouse then with a gamepad oddly enough.. if you do aim to use one remapping the keys is recommended)","January 4, 2014","true","9.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For any die hard transformer fan this is a game for you, you will see that the writers had so much fun making inside jokes and references from the original seris and movie.

Most shooters take a while to lay out the plotline and introduce the characters, but with this game the action starts immediately.

I'm extremely happy with the loading scenes since they barely take any times.

I'll be waiting for a door to open as the game loads less than 5 seconds and the door opens and I'm jumping right into the action.\n\nI did have a little pet peeve with the driving mode within this game. Obviously, being Transformers, the way that the robots transform between modes is amazing graphically. The "cars" look so damn cool, but the driving controls were a little confusing. It may be my lack of playing PC racing games, but the controls felt a little funky compared to the actual walking mode that the game offered. Nonetheless, the ability to transform between modes differentiates Transformers from all other games.\n\nTransformers: Fall of Cybertron, offers a multiplayer mode; however, this gamemode does not compare with the campaign mode at all.

It's extremely annoying playing in a match where it's completely dominated by a hacker. If you're looking at this game for a multiplayer shooter, then you should redirect your attention other games.\n\nOverall, on the rating scale, this game has everything to offer.

On the hard playthough however... It was a challenge to a point, but this game was not designed for what they used as the final fight. Reminds me too much of the first God of War's final fight. Strip most of the combat mechanics and stuff you into a too small arena. All the while taunting you with a "change the difficulty screen." I Do NOT want to change the difficulty. What I want is for you to not change the game mechanics at the last second for the sake of a "more difficult" final fight. After an hour of hearing the same dialoge I gave up. The second a game goes from fun to work I'm done. A pity that the final fight is such a change in direction. Here's a hint for the next game.

War for Crybertron wasn't a bad game, but it did feel like it was missing some sort of umph. FoC has so much more soul, the controls are tighter, the transformations feel smoother, and so much more. While the co-op option was removed, they used that extra time and energy to make the single player campaign so much better.\n\nMuch of the game is a prequel to events in the original series, and some of it will not be canon. However, the play on some events does not detract from the game at all. The constant homages to the Generation 1 series of cartoons as well as the movie add so much life to the game.\n\nOverall, the game was constantly action packed, the Transformers you play are different enough to keep the play styler varied, the weapons were good, and the levels had a much better design this time around. To anyone who loves the Transformers, especially the original series, this is the game for you. For those who are looking for another action game, it still holds up, but it may not be as satisfying to non-fans.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/darkside55/recommended/213120/","darkside55","[DSE]Emperor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/darkside55/","120 products in account","Fall of Cybertron picks up where War for Cybertron left off: Optimus Prime has commissioned an Ark to leave Cybertron behind to the Decepticons, a plan that some of his fellow 'bots question. Meanwhile, the Decepticons continue their conquest of the planet, and are hellbent on not allowing the Autobots to take the pacifistic route out of their conflict.\n\nIf you played War for Cybertron, you know what to expect from the singleplayer campaign: a solid Transformers story told during the early stages of the war, as viewed from both Autobot and Decepticon perspectives. Unlike War for Cybertron, in Fall you do not pick which faction's story you want to play through: instead, the story jumps from character-to-character, Autobot to Decepticon, depending on the narrative. This was neither a pro nor a con: the story is still tight, and although the 'choice' was removed, you likely ended up playing both factions' storylines in WfC anyway.\n\nThe different bots in FoC all have unique abilities beyond just their alt modes: Jazz, for example, has a grappling hook that allows him to traverse vertically throughout his level. Playing as Cliffjumper switches up the usual run-and-gun in this game for more stealth-oriented gameplay, sneaking up on enemies and dispatching them with quick executions. But the coolest ability is as you play through the Combaticons' story parts, eventually merging into the rampaging Bruticus. Playing as a combiner is awesome.\n\nOnce you've completed the singleplayer mode, you'll want to jump into the multiplayer. Here's where the game really shines--but also exposes some of its biggest flaws. The actual meat of the multiplayer is great: customizing your bots is hands down the coolest thing in this game, creating your own builds, color schemes, unlocking new parts, and ranking up to gain new weaponry and abilities will consume your time. The gameplay is frenetic, and shooting other Transformers never gets old. There are a lot of "Hell yeah!" moments to be had while playing this game.\n\nThat being said, multiplayer has some serious issues. First off, there is no chat. Let me say that again. THERE IS NO CHAT. None. Nada. Not at all. Not in-game, not in the multiplayer lobby, nowhere and no-how. If you want to communicate with your fellow 'bots or 'cons, you better master the art of interpretive jumping and shooting to indicate what you want to tell them, because that's all you get. Somehow, in a game with such good core multiplayer, they forgot to add in a feature that's been a staple of online games since MUDs. As Kup would say, "Of all the circuit-glitched, diode-blowing dimwittery, YOU LEFT A PIECE OUT!"\n\nSo maybe you don't care about talking to your teammates or enemies, you just want to blast other people. Well, you can...but you might have to wait a short while, depending on when you log in, as player population in this game fluctuates. Multiplayer definitely isn't dead--I've jumped on at all hours, and I never really have to wait longer than a few minutes to get into a match. But you might want to set your matchmaker settings to "Worldwide" just to be sure.\n\nAnd because this game uses peer-to-peer multiplayer, expect getting iffy connections--although I've never found them to be too bad--and in the case of people quitting out of the match early, the dreaded "Host Migration" warning. If the person hosting the game leaves, expect an agony worse than Galvatron faced when Unicron was torturing him. You will sit there with that message blinking red on your screen for an ungodly amount of time, and 9 times out of 10 it will make you wait just to boot you back to the multiplayer menu.\n\nCheating is also an issue you might come across in this game. Now, some people might exaggerate how rampant it is, but honestly I barely ever see anyone blatantly cheating. You may, once in one hundred games, see that one player with the illegible name spamming infinite rockets out of his gun at velocities reserved for Macross and not Transformers, but screw that person and just switch to a different game. With any luck, you might've been the host, and just subjected him to the horrors of Host Migration.\n\nIf you can get past those flaws, multiplayer is really rewarding. There are a lot of 3rd person shooters out there, but there are no other 3rd person shooters that allow you to play as a jet, soaring over your enemies--who are cars, btw--while pelting them with missiles, only to have them transform into giant robots who are now blasting back at you with shotguns. And that's when you also transform into a giant robot, deploy an aerial sentry gun overhead to rain down machinegun death, while dropping on top of your enemies and converting your arm into an energy sword to hack them to pieces.\n\nAnd while it's a shame the game hasn't had a permanent price drop, it's worth the price of admission if you're a huge Transformers fan--or even if you're just a fan of shooters with good plots and fun gameplay.","June 26, 2014","true","109.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

On the hard playthough however... It was a challenge to a point, but this game was not designed for what they used as the final fight. Reminds me too much of the first God of War's final fight. Strip most of the combat mechanics and stuff you into a too small arena. All the while taunting you with a "change the difficulty screen." I Do NOT want to change the difficulty. What I want is for you to not change the game mechanics at the last second for the sake of a "more difficult" final fight. After an hour of hearing the same dialoge I gave up. The second a game goes from fun to work I'm done. A pity that the final fight is such a change in direction. Here's a hint for the next game. If you wouldn't design the entire game one way for the final fight then don't ♥♥♥♥ing use that design.","June 23, 2014","true","15.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After a brief tutorial level that tries its best not to be, you start on the very linear campaign that kind of pulls you in the direction you have to go in whilst it is definitely entertaining there isn't really any room for tactics.\n\nThe A.I. (although technically all transformers are A.I. anyways) can be easily picked off in some scenarios; however, in other scenarios they actually work together to flank you and rush you. I was playing on the hard difficulty and I actually died a couple times because of this. Turns out even Optimus Prime can have a hard time with infantry grunts weilding shotguns. The bigger more eviler Decepticon grunts are actually kind of a challenge to kill (again on hard I haven't tried easy) especially when there is two or more. This game does a decent job at giving you enemies to fight.\n\nAnother thing I didn't like was that exploring often left you unrewarded. There were plenty of places that looked like it would bare loot but it did not or it was just one of these audio log things. The audio logs are somewhat interesting as it provides some story filler and insight to Transformers lore but are very easy to find.\n\nMy last problem with the game is it runs at 60 FPS max (I have a 120hz monitor) and I've never really been a fan of Unreal Engine 3. The control customization is like how you can change a button layout in a console version of the game; the entire game kind of feels a bit too much like a console port but it's not that bad at least.\n\nStill these minor nuisances did not keep me from enjoying the campaign there are plenty of climactic moments and fun weapons to use to wreak havok with. The actual Transforming tactic can be pretty useful but you will have to figure out yourself how to use it.\n\nTo conclude, this game is I'd have to assign a value of 20-30 dollars depening on how much you enjoy the multiplayer. It's a good experience but does not offer much replayability but if you are a Transformers fan then this game is a must.","May 4, 2014","true","11.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game has a great storyline, awesome multiplayer and very good art direction. That being said, there is something terribly wrong with this game.\n\nFirst and foremost, this game seems to be all about the money, not about community and/or support of said community. Fall of Cybertron is a typical release from one of the biggest companies in gaming history. As such the price for the core game is kept artificially high (even during sales) and the DLC is overpriced and lacklustre.\nThe development team was taken off the game about a month or two after release so patching bugs or changing detrimental flaws is just not going to happen.\n\nThe game is a straight up console port with no PC love given whatsoever. The only reason it isn't dead yet is its community. People that want to play Transformers and are willing to put up with the non-existant support and consequentially the rampant and blatant cheaters that plague the multiplayer landscape.\n\nIt's sad that a game and a franchise that has such devout following gets so little love from its own creators. Personally I hope that one day a company that cares about the franchise (beyond seeing it as a big golden cash-cow) can have a go at making a great Transformers game. One that has some lasting vision, and some heart. For now, fans of the franchise are stuck with this: an awesome game that could have been so much more were it not for corporate greed and the ever present God-money.\n\nCan I recommend this game? Yes. But only if you, like me, are a devout follower of the franchise. At full price, even a year after release, with the dwindeling player numbers and the non-existant support, it is just not going to be worth it for the average gamer. It is a real shame that something so awesome can leave such a bad taste in your mouth.","August 23, 2012","true","22.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The campaign is more interesting introducing and controlling familiar characters that are a mix of the movie and G1 versions. The campaign also kept things interesting as one mission is stealth oriented while another is focused on running through a lab looking for lost team mates. The story also bounces between Autobot and Decepticon or different characters, unlike the previous games here's one side, now here's the other. It greatly adds to the story and makes it less rigid.\nI briefly played the multiplayer which feels like a lesser version of COD style level progression unlocking weapons and add-ons but the reward to level ratio is skewed.

Maybe in the next installation it will be a mixture of solo and group to diversify the game play even more than what it already is.\nAnother complaint (though this will change in later date) is the price tag at the moment.

The game has a great storyline, awesome multiplayer and very good art direction. That being said, there is something terribly wrong with this game.\n\nFirst and foremost, this game seems to be all about the money, not about community and/or support of said community. Fall of Cybertron is a typical release from one of the biggest companies in gaming history. As such the price for the core game is kept artificially high (even during sales) and the DLC is overpriced and lacklustre.\nThe development team was taken off the game about a month or two after release so patching bugs or changing detrimental flaws is just not going to happen.\n\nThe game is a straight up console port with no PC love given whatsoever. The only reason it isn't dead yet is its community. People that want to play Transformers and are willing to put up with the non-existant support and consequentially the rampant and blatant cheaters that plague the multiplayer landscape.\n\nIt's sad that a game and a franchise that has such devout following gets so little love from its own creators. Personally I hope that one day a company that cares about the franchise (beyond seeing it as a big golden cash-cow) can have a go at making a great Transformers game. One that has some lasting vision, and some heart. For now, fans of the franchise are stuck with this: an awesome game that could have been so much more were it not for corporate greed and the ever present God-money.\n\nCan I recommend this game? Yes. But only if you, like me, are a devout follower of the franchise. At full price, even a year after release, with the dwindeling player numbers and the non-existant support, it is just not going to be worth it for the average gamer. It is a real shame that something so awesome can leave such a bad taste in your mouth.","August 23, 2012","true","22.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The campaign is more interesting introducing and controlling familiar characters that are a mix of the movie and G1 versions. The campaign also kept things interesting as one mission is stealth oriented while another is focused on running through a lab looking for lost team mates. The story also bounces between Autobot and Decepticon or different characters, unlike the previous games here's one side, now here's the other. It greatly adds to the story and makes it less rigid.\nI briefly played the multiplayer which feels like a lesser version of COD style level progression unlocking weapons and add-ons but the reward to level ratio is skewed.

Though as awesome as this game may be, I feel that the it's predecessor was a better game given that every mission was a party of three, giving you a joice to pick among the three. That's not to say that I didn't enjoy playing solo at all its just some parts of the game I'd rather be in a group (more dialogue this way). Maybe in the next installation it will be a mixture of solo and group to diversify the game play even more than what it already is.\nAnother complaint (though this will change in later date) is the price tag at the moment. Game retails at $59.99 which I don't think the game is worth that much.\n\nBottom line: I do recommend this game and you will have a ton of fun playing, but try to catch it on sale like I did.

Although I never watched the original G1 Cartoons or Beast Wars, I did watch Armada and some of Energon, as well as the Bayformers trilogy. Back in 2008 I bought Transformers: War for Cybertron and I loved it. I never got to buying Fall of Cybertron until now when the Activison Steam Sale came up and I was not dissapointed.\n\nThe story for Fall of Cybertron in my opinion is much better compared to War for Cybertron's. The humor is still there and the characters have their own sense of personality, which I like. Unlike War for Cybertron, there aren't two other characters supporting you through the mission, which also means that the co-op campaign from the first game is not present aswell. However, you have an ingame store in which you can buy and upgrade weapons. items and perks using Energon. The gameplay is overall similar to the first game and it felt natural to me. Besides the story, I have yet to try the multiplayer, or Escalation, which was one of my favorite parts of War for Cybertron.\n\nOverall, Fall of Cybertron is much better than it's predecessor and I enjoyed it very much. The only negative thing I can think of besides no co-op campaign is that the game is still priced $59.99. If you wait for a Steam Sale however, this should not be a problem.\n\n9/10.","May 10, 2014","true","7.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game without that, with the story, the action, and all the different characters is still incredible! There is a great deal of weapons and upgrades, so you can stick with making one gun really powerful or just generally enhance all of them. The fact you can swap your weapon hand in this game, as apposed to the last lends itself to the really fun gunplay in which you either have to take cover or keep moving and dodging. Most the cover is destructible in some way by the way. The transforming into a vehicle has great animation and it just feels fantastic every time I do it in game whether in combat or to move around. Also, I should mention each character feels unique in their own way, and you can sense the love that went into this game, it even has a few fanservice moments if you watched the old show. I'm currently playing it my second time with keyboard and still feels pretty good. Overall, this is one mind-blowing game with some major "HELL YEAH!" moments.

I totally agree with this sentiment. I'm not a huge fan, but I like Transformers, a lot.\n\nI won't spoil or try not to spoil parts of the game with my personal review of Transformers: Fall for Cybertron or TFC for short. I played the game on Normal difficulty and finished it in around 10 hours maybe less.\n\nStory-\nI won't say much about the story here, its best for you to experience it yourself, but its nothing to write home about. You will understand exactly what needs to be done and whats going on. There are references to other Transformer things which was done very well.\n\nGraphics-\nThe graphics are well thought out and the overall design of things is amazing. A mix of metal and organic terrain made for great level design in terms of where you went and how you moved. I can't say the same for graphics.... The graphics are poor when up close and worse when you're in a cutscene. The teaser videos for the game looked so awesome, but thats where the "shiny-ness" ends. Your character looks great and so do other bots. I enjoy the little things that shift and move on your character. Transformations are also fun to watch. I liked Vortex and Jazz for their transformations.\n\n\nUI-\nI hated the UI for TFC. You had to really pay attention in order to find certain things. It was made worse for the PC port. Scrolling tickers to describe things, saves space but also makes it extremely annoying to read. BUT it doesnt matter when most of the screen is empty space! Navigation is a joke on PC. I'm sure it would have been tolerable for console but not by much. Repeatedly having to press the cycle page button to go to each tab was a pain in the neck. Why not click on the tab that we wanted to be in? Again, this is a PC port and its terrible. Even the keybinds were locked to 4-5 different combinations of options to choose from, I was blown away.\n\nPC is unable to change each key manually, which hurt this game for PC by a lot. What could I do? I had to bare it.\n\nTransformation-\nI'll speak of tranformation in a seperate place because I played the PC port of the game. Yes, I know the game was not designed for PC and it was later implemented to be played on PC. I'm not sure how being in vehicle mode differs from PC to console, but in the PC, the sensitivity is reduced drastically where its extremely slow to manuver you vehicle around. Driving like a car was a mess and its either a slight angle towards some random direction or a 90 degree angle swerve in the direction you want to go. Flight mode was fine going in one direction but if you needed to turn around, it was about 3-4 swipes of my mouse to make a 180 turn. I had to get used to this problem in order to play certain sections which forced you to play in vehicle mode.\n\nIt was fine in robot mode, but vehicle was a different story. I enjoyed myself the most in Vortex's stage. I loved Vortex as a playable character, robot mode, then helicopter then jet when boosting in air, rapid fire guns that sped up as you held it down longer and extremely satisfying explosive rounds you can fire.\n\nTransformations were either forced events or never used. In robot mode, you can shoot, run, dash, dodge, and jump. In car mode you just went straight or hovered slowly firing your weak guns. The levels were designed in a way where it was most useful to play in robot mode and others in car mode. They were very obvious about it. It wasn't much of a choice if you wanted to play in a particular mode. I had the most fun in Vortex's and Starscreams stage because they balanced the stage in a way where you had to fly to your location to fight on either land or air. If you got cornered you can fly away for a better angle or if you had some skills you can dodge on land and out-manuver your enemy.\n\nGameplay-\nGoing through different sections to fight the enemy was a blast. Literally. Everywhere you go, there is an explosion happening. I don't mind it too much. Specially for one or two sections of the game where its quiet for a reason. As I mentioned in Transformations, the level design was based on what form you had to be.\n\nYou had a good variety of enemies to fight. You had flying guys, snipers that fly to different locations, rocket launcher guys that stayed in the back, but were useless, regular gun guys that hid behind cover and moved around from cover to cover, heavy guys that had shotguns which rushed your position and would teabag you if it was part of the game( most dangerous enemy IMO). Bugs that swarm you, and a few more. Each posed a threat in their own way, but nontheless weak.\n\nBoss fights? Well, we have a few, but ALL invovle, "hit this" or "break this" to hurt the boss. You never actually fight the main boss mano y mano but rather something else that hurts the boss. This makes boss fights extremely simple to programs and fight.\n\nThere is a large variety of guns to choose from. You find blueprints to unlock new guns to buy at a Teleraan 1 machine scattered at obvious points, almost abundant. There you can buy guns, equip different ones if you don't like the one you're carrying, upgrade guns and perks, and buy consumables. The only reason I use this, is to get a different gun to suit my playstyle. The only upgrades I got were the perks for increased health, health and ammo supply everytime you access a Teleraan 1, shield cooldown. You can only carry one main gun and one heavy gun. Heavy guns most have special abilities attached to them. Your main guns are your basic fair, with some other interesting ones. Most guns have upgrades, which are generic and un-impactful.\nYou can also carry two sub wepaons that are consumed on use. The only one I found that was useful was the shield, which you can shoot through.\nPerks are some generic upgrades that make your character stronger in same way. If they removed the upgrades system all together, the game would have played the same.\n\nOH! Did I forget to explain to you that there is currency in the game? Well, neither did the game.... It was pertinent to show use how to jump, dash, shoot, and transform, but not tell us that money was needed to buy things. They also don't tell you that certain things break and contain money called Shards. I walked by something like a box or crate and thought it was useful later on because it had a blue outline. I later found out that all those boxes I passed were Shard containers!\n\nEach chapter had a different Transformer to play as, and that changed things up a bit for playstyles. It's a welcome sight to change the repeatative nature of go to location and shoot stuff, when you can change how you get there makes it a different experience.\nFor example, you either would use your biped's, fly, sneak, drive, or stomp your way to different locations based on the character and chapter you played. This also enabled you to play both sides of the fight. Playing Autobot or Decepticon. Each playing a different role in the fight for what the fate of all bots are going to be. Of course those familiar with the story will know exactly what it is. This created different things for the bots to do in order to survive. Each had some sort of impact in the story. (don't be confused with player choice, there is none here.) Very linear.\n\nPrice-\nI would say that the price tag is asking way too much, even for a fan. $60 for an average of 10 hours of gameplay? No, thanks. I waited it out till the game went on sale for 75% off. That took about 2 years to happen! Even then I felt robbed of my $20. The value you get for this game is worth $15-$20 at most. I didn't even attempt multiplayer because I knew that it was filled with hackers and bots, and it would have been like standing on Cybertron when all life has ceased to exist.\n\nLike many have also said, This game is the best Transformers game to date. They aren't lying, but its still a mediocre game. 7 out of 10 at $20 for me.","May 8, 2014","true","16.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Everything in it from the environments, to the lore, to the characters and voice actors all magnificently capture the essense and feel that makes Transformers Transformers. In remembrance to my War for Cybertron review, I shall now list 30 things off the top of my head that makes Transformers Fall of Cybertron a great game:\n\n1. It's got friggin' Transformers\n2. You get to play as all the iconic and memorable characters from the franchise\n3. All of the controls have been streamlined and refined in transition from the last game making for a fantastic gaming experience\n4. Varied and extremely well paced levels based on which Transformer you play as meaning you will never get bored as you play!\n5. You get to be complete badasses as all of the guys you play as but even more so as BRUTICUS AND GRIMLOCK\n6. Peter Cullen reprises his role as Optimus Prime in addition to the remaining extremely talented cast who played all of their parts to perfection. The voice acting in this game truly is some of the best in the medium.\n7. True to form and true to name. Everything in the game is what one would expect of a Transformers Cybertron game and even more.\n8. A gripping narrative that explores the last dying hours of Cybertron; a tale truly remarkable, one of civil war, struggle, freedom, camaraderie, loss and hope.\n9. Well rounded, extremely likeable, very memorable, nostalgia-inducing cast of characters that will make you love the franchise even if you have never watched or played a single Transformers show or game.\n10. Wonderfully crafted environments that really make you feel that you are in a dying planet ravaged by centuries of warfare.\n11. Incredible character models and animations that make transformations so seemless, robot movements so natural and moving, transforming environments that really make you feel that you are in a living, breathing world.\n12. Everything that made the first game (sans Co-op) made it to the sequel... BUT WITH MORE! You can now sprint, dodge, and air dash!\n13. All of the new additions above made playing as the Transformers feel like you're actually playing as trained warriors as opposed to simply walking behemoths with big guns... Now, you can be a walking behemoth with big guns AND ALSO BE MORE BADASS BY USING BADASS EVASIVE MANEUVERS!\n14. The game does a fantastic introduction wherein you actually play in the final chapter and then the next chapters have you revisiting events that happened before that final chapter in order for you to find out about all of the things that lead to said finale. In other words, the game throws you into THE most intense moments of the narrative as the INTRODUCTION, and IT WAS FANTASTIC.\n15. One may think that because they showed you the most intense moments in the first chapter since the first chapter is also the final chapter, the rest of the game wouldn't be as exciting... WRONG! This game is filled with what can be coined as "♥♥♥♥ yeah!" moments wherein there are these moments that are so damn epic that you just can't help and clench your fist and position your arms into a victorious pose all while saying, whispering or even screaming "♥♥♥♥ Yeah!". And this game, is FILLED with it.\n16. The actual final chapter, once you play it, is EVEN MORE INTENSE than when you first experienced it. It is absolutely MINDBLOWING.\n17. Remember how I talked about those "♥♥♥♥ Yeah!" moments? Grimlock's Transformation, that is all.\n18. You know what, I lied. Here's another: Friggin' Metroplex\n19. Incredible dialogue, fantastic one-liners, war banters and Transformer Jargon that are all music to your ears.\n20. You thought being able to transform from a robot to a vehicle is cool? Well then, how about playing as a Transformer who can transform into a robot, a helicopter AND a jet! How's that for cool.\n21. If that's not cool enough, said character can transform and MERGE with his friends to create an EVEN BIGGER BADASS robot!\n22. Transforming isn't a gimmick! In a third person shooter, one might think that the transformations are just a feature that one might not even need in order to play but nope. The transformation mechanic has been incredibly integrated into the gameplay that feels natural and intuitive!\n23. Its awesome multiplayer is still alive and kicking, even after 3 years since its release!\n24. THAT SOUNDTRACK! Holy crap, I really wish High Moon studios released the official soundtrack because I would've bought that in a heartbeat.\n25. While a lot of the levels in War for Cybertron were amazing, they also felt a bit constrained because a majority of them took place indoors and so, within closed spaces. Fall of Cybertron however really takes its game engine to the limit by giving you vast and open battlefields that are never resting, always moving with constant gunfire and air skirmishes being witnessed happening in the background. This game really showcases Cybertron's finest sceneries...even if those sceneries may have been ravished, wartorn and dying.\n26. DINOBOTS!!!\n27. REFERENCES! Lots and lots of references! This game is filled with shoutouts, omages and references to previous works in the franchise and those who would recognise them are sure to have a blast! (from the past!)\n28. Intense and unforgiving yet completely fair gameplay. This game can get pretty hard at times especially if you set it so, but whenever you die, you will die because you were being stupid. You won't ever feel that the game was being unfair because of unfair mechanics or sudden surprise pitfalls, you will be dying because you did something stupid and you took too much damage or you were too impatient.\n29. Incredible execution of quick time events! There aren't that many in this game but whenever there are, they never feel tedious and only happen often enough to maximise your immersion as the character you are playing as. Not to mention doing them feels so good.\n30. This is a game made of passion and love for franchise and you will see, feel and hear it as you play it. This is undoubtedly a Transformers game made by developers with a deep love for the franchise for players who also have a deep love for the franchise.\n\nI'll reiterate by saying that: Even if you have never played a Transformers game or watched a Transformers show, if you play this amazing game, then you will undoubtedly love it by the end of it.","March 15, 2015","true","11.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In a way, it did some things I wasn't too terribly thrilled about, but did others that kind of made up for it. WfC had a neat campaign, in which you got to play as the Decepticons and the Autobots and see each side of the respective storylines. FoC, on the other hand, mixes it up and does it more in a sort of episodic formula. On one hand, this is a pretty neat approach to the game, and it allows you to try out the various mechanics the games offers. However, I can't help but think it's an overglorified tutorial for what is apparently supposed to the main part of this game, the multiplayer. And while I enjoy multiplayer games every once in a while, this isn't really the sort of game I'd play an online portion for.\n\nThe big hook of this game, for me, was the dinobots. Especially Grimlock, since they advertised him in many of the trailers. The problem, of course, is that you get to play him, but only for one mission. And it's near the end of the game. However, playing as Grimlock is just insanely and wonderfully satisfying. You're playing a big badass transforming-robot-TRex and the game just makes you feel like almsot nothing can seriously harm you. And best of all, he's one of the good guys. Unfortunately, if you want to play as him online, you have to buy a separate pack that contains all four of the dinobots. Or rather, 4 playable dinobots.\n\nOverall, the changes made to Fall of Cybertron don't necessarily hinder it, but if you're someone looking for a decent single player experience, I would recommend sticking with the predecessor. However, if you can bare it for about 11 chapters, you'll be rewarded with one of the most satisfying experiences I've played in a while.","September 14, 2014","true","9.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The whole thing is a love letter to guys who grew up with the franchise and you can tell that the team behind it really wanted to do the property justice. They delivered in a big way.\n\nFall of Cybertron is a third-person shooter with surprisingly tight gameplay, a phenomenal campaign, good competitive multiplayer, and a co-op horde mode.\n\nThe campaign is split down the middle. Half of the levels have you playing as the Autobots, through their side of the story. And the other is the Decepticons, playing through their side. Both parts of the campaign are brilliantly done and there's a lot to love if you're a Transformers nerd. Optimus Prime running through the trenches screaming needlessly about freedom brings a smile to my face every time. Over the course of the campaign, you'll play as many different characters with unique abilities, and each has their own feel. It's a great feature that makes every level feel different from the last. It's a great little campaign that never gets boring. This is the main attraction of the game, for sure.\n\nThroughout the levels are stations where you can select your loadout and upgrade your weapon with resources you gather as you kill enemies and play through the game. These upgrades go across both factions and all characters, and there's a lot of options. Weapon variety is great, and it's made even better because it ties into the upgrade system. Most upgrades are simple (upgrade a gun's accuracy, or its ammo capacity, etc.) but if you buy all the upgrades for a given weapon, you get a more unique and powerful upgrade that varies from weapon to weapon. These upgrades stay unlocked even when you replay the game, so it's functionally a constant new game+ mode where you can continue to play through and unlock upgrades. Great for replay value.\n\nThe gameplay is absolutely perfect for what a Transformers game should be. At any time you can switch into vehicle mode to increase mobility or access a different set of weapons, and it's actually balanced very well. Sure you may already be a giant death robot, but if you transform into a giant death tank you have access to heavier, long range weapons, at the cost of speed. Or maybe transform into a fast car that has no real firepower to speak of, but insane speed. It's all very smooth and functions well. All depends on the character/class you're playing as.\n\nMultiplayer can be played in a cooperative horde mode/tower defense style, or traditional competitive play. There's not much to say about the horde mode. It's the same horde/tower defense mode we've seen dozens of times, and you collect resources to unlock new parts of the map, weapons, etc. like in Nazi Zombies. It's fun, but nothing to write home about.\n\nThe competitive mode lets you fully customize your own Transformer (you can have presets from both factions) using bits from existing characters (as well as full control over the paint job), and it's a lot of fun. You're simply pitted against other players in traditional MP modes (deathmatch, domination, etc.). It's balanced and works well. No complaints whatsoever. It's a fun mode that is surprisingly well-balanced.\n\nOne thing to note is that, strangely, the PC port does NOT have controller support in some menus. It does for most of the game, but some menus it's just absent with no explanation. For instance, the upgrade system I mentioned earlier? The upgrade menu requires you to use your mouse and keyboard, even if you've been playing the game with a controller. A minor inconvenience, but an inconvenience nonetheless.\n\nWe'll probably never see another Transformers game like this, because the sequel was tied into the Michael Bay movie series because of corporate meddling, and passed off to another developer.\n\nBig time recommendation by the Transformers fanboy in me who grew up.","June 10, 2015","true","11.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Escalation is also fun, with a team of like-minded robots taking on waves and waves of Decepticons.\n\nIn my opinion, -this- was the last great Transformers game.

Being able to play through all my beloved Transformers characters brought me back to my childhood and being able to crush my enemies in epic battles as Cybertron crumbled around me was something I've wished for for so long. The same goes for War for Cybertron. While the story seems to have finished, I look forward to future titles whether they are in the Transformers universe or elsewhere. Truly outstanding work that painted a clear, creative picture of how Cyberton fell while still adhering to the classic feel and overall story of the original series.

But don't let that notion stop you from playing this game. First of all, no humans in sight. The game has great visuals in the environments, designs of the robots and how they transform. The sound department is also decent, the voice work was amazing and the dialog was nice to hear. Not too cheesy but also not Shakespeare. It has a good online infrastructure but by the time of this review there are not many players on it, which is a shame for such a great game. But even if online play is not your thing, the story mode is reminiscent of the saturday morning cartoons this is based on. Easy to follow and to enjoy. It has several difficulties and even normal represents a good challenge. I can't recommend this game any further because you don't need to. Go buy this game! If not here, also get it on PS3 or 360 I think there's a demo on those versions. But trust me, for a shooting game, nothing beats the mouse (maybe the Wii remote but that's another story).

However This is a transformers fan dream game.  The multiplayer isn't all that livley now but the game is worth a shot just to expierence a lot of your old G1 character on Cybertron.  Weapoin upgrades play a role as do combat in vehicle or robot mode.  It's also nice that they added in a sprint for robot mode, and now ammo is far more robust then the first game allowing players to have more fun rather then simply go for neccessarry headshots to conserve ammo.

This is IronShark7740 here to give you my take on Transformers Fall of Cybertron. First off I would like to talk about the campaign. I believe it has a good story line with every level being different from the last. The unique abilities of each character allow you to get a full variety of play. But I have a few issues on the campaign. I wish they showed a little bit about the origin of them and their homeworld of Cybertron. Also part of my game had minor and major glitches. In the Cliffjumper level right after Jazz finds the "Autobot distress signal," the door way right after that, the one you walk through to move on, when i moved through the door i ended up in an endless freefall and had to restart to the last checkpoint. Now to talk about the Multiplayer. It is just... AWESOME!! I love the customization and variety of each character and class. I also like the maps they made for this game. I like that they included a map from War for Cybertron to bring a bit of familiarity. All in all a really great game. Good story, good multiplayer. I almost forgot to mention the Escalation. Great game mode. It's nice that you can fight enemies as a team with your friends. I highly recomend this game. So this is my review of Transformers Fall of Cybertron.

Moist Panties","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CPTMOISTPANTIES/","261 products in account","Picking off exactly where War for Cybertron left off, FoC is a direct continuation of the previous title with more of the same. The new additions are sparse: a store terminal for upgrades (welcomed addition); audio logs scattered throughout maps that don't add much; a couple of new autobots to play as, and...that's about it. This isn't criticism, it's observation.\n\nCo-op's been taken out, which sucks (unless you never played the mode). I loved the banter that came from the co-op mode, and this takes away from the experience. You also don't get the 'episode recaps' from the previous title, instead the game directly continues onto the next chapter. A minor ommission, but still noticeable.\n\nWith that said, the game is overall a better experience than the previous title. It's still more of the same, but it's done better and on a grander scale. Rather than the linear maps of WfC, you get plenty of open fields with cover and weaponry strewn about. It's somewhat wasted on the Autobot section of the game, since they all transform into cars and the only objective is to run from A to B (yawn). But the Decepticon portion has you turning into a helicopter, and even the portions where you're an automobile are better since you're fighting under a large tanker with the objective of eliminating enemies rather than running through a very weak obstacle course.\n\nThere is a decent portion in the Autobot campaign where you play around with a grappling hook in a large, open area. But it's more of the exception rather than the rule, and even in that campaign it's still 90% linear with only one section letting you grapple freely in a large area. By far the Decepticon campaign is better, but I'll give the Autobot section some credit for trying some new things in the series.\n\nThe story is...meh. These are the last hours of Cybertron and there's not much to add other than 'we need to get the fu*k out of here'. But who plays these games for the story.\n\nNot much more to say: if you liked the previous title you'll love this one. It's marginally better, which is to say it's a good experience+1.","June 1, 2015","true","25.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

Why?\n\namazing controls with the option of gamepad support and key rebinds.\nEasy to run for even the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ office PC\n\n- Decent story thats good for a few runs\n- Escalation brings a good Hord mode to PC just transformers style and somewhat faster paced.\n-Adds HUGE Custimization compared to the first game War for cybertron\n- More everything really with impreovments upon what made the 1st so enjoyable for me.\n\nIve played a large amount of TPS games and this is my favorite aside from Space marine and gears of war. Its a really good buy for those looking for a more PG or science fiction TPS.\n\n- Multiplayer is very fun , With a rock paper scissors style that with skill can be somewhat broken so you actually have to work with your team. Its not like other games where your role is IT! If you have the skill you can break the food chain and stand on top.\n\n- Casual gamer friendly.","July 7, 2015","true","14.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

I didn't like the controls and gamepads aren't fully integrated (eg. you need to switch to your mouse if you want exit the shop).\n\nI can't tell if the story is confusing or just random because I started ignoring it. The game is also littered with awful NPC dialogue which I suspect was stolen from an unknown trashy WW2 game.

Fall of Cybertron returns with more of the relentless action, faithful characterisations and mind-blowing locations that made the first so popular.\n\nUnlike the first game, which contained 2 separate campaigns for Autobots and Decepticons, Fall of Cybertron switches you between both sides as you progress along the same storyline. Combat is intense and surprisingly challenging, and the addition of partially-destructable environments adds a tactical element to the fight. The voice-over work is great, with everything from the central characters to the incidental dialogue remaining faithful to the nature of each faction. The graphics are quite good, with a few trademarks of the Unreal engine unmistakably apparent - sometimes a positive, sometimes a negative. Glitches aren't frequent, thankfully, but the two or three I noticed required a re-load to get around. 8/10 - worth the 50 bucks.","August 24, 2012","true","7.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Unfortunatly there is a high chance that there is a hacker or cheater in the match that has like 10 times the attack speed of the gun, can hover in place for ever, or inifinite stun grenades which really makes the online play horrid. The story portion is good like it's predecessor war for cybertron but lacks the co-op play so another minus points for that.","May 28, 2014","false","6.9"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","9","19","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/saltydaveiv/recommended/213120/","saltydaveiv","david / BNET: OceansAbove#1601","http://steamcommunity.com/id/saltydaveiv/","338 products in account","A worthy sequel to the great War for Cybertron (and is not recommended without playing that first), but different in some ways that shouldn't have changed, and of course there are some really fun new features too. The gameplay is the well known arcade shooter style we've seen in TF:WfC, but this time it punishes those who favor melee fights by getting blown to pieces almost as easily as we destroy decepticons or autobots for reasons beyond me - propably they wanted to create contrast between some character types.\n\nYou cannot choose which side you want to play as before, but instead the campign is now linear (still you'll get to play equal time on both sides, so don't worry) and changes the side you play on quite often as the story unfolds. The graphics and sounds / voiceovers look and sound just as good as you'd expect it after the first game, and TF:FoC is a steamworks title so you'll find plenty of achievements (on top of ingame collectibles and some hidden extras) to collect. About multiplayer: this is the biggest difference compared to TF:WfC, and not in a good way. CO-OP story is gone. Fall of Cybertron definitly lost a lot replayability because of this if you are not interested in Escalation (CO-OP survival arena, a.k.a. horde mode) or Multiplayer - in which you can create and customize your dream transformer, finally! Pretty much garanteed there are no men out there who wouldn't remember those good ol' childhood "let's build one" memories, so it's fun - until you find out there aren't many people out there who actually play multiplayer.\n\nThe campign is a blast and despite it's length (6-7 hours) it feels just as long as it's needed to be, but without co-op the game feels much less than it's prequel. If you loved that, you'll love this just as much. Personally I grabbed it when it was on sale for around 13 euros, I don't regret any of it spent on Fall of Cybertron, it's an excellent shooter / beat 'em up with the classic enviroment, nothing less, but nothing more.","May 8, 2014","true","7.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

( ow yeah , im fans of dino's ! ) especially grimlocks  ( its awesome!! its m*%$#@F*&^%$% T-rex ! ) and insecticon is in this game.\n\nand this game even has the multiplayer mode, that i find it a lot of player still playing this game online :D\nmaybe the first timer of transformers fans will got confused, so its okay to get the war first, but i guess even so, can still enjoy this game for the multiplayer mode, the MP mode is good. recommended to buy the dlc havoc or dinobots first. but it depend on you liking wich one you like to use in multiplayer mode.\n\ni give this game a 7/10 , since the melee kinda hard to use and the loadout cant use all weapon since their default is followed their default class loadout. but these just a minor minus, since you can get the best experience to defeat your opponent in multiplayer. see ya at game's fella!!

It fixes many of the PC bugs from the last game and the quality is improved. The graphics quality is much better than it is on console. The story is absolutely wonderful and the gameplay styles in the story are everchanging. Like stealth? How about hack and slash? Both of these gameplay styles are included in the third person shooter. The multiplayer is great, not as good as the last game, but still can give you hours upon hours of enjoyment! The escalation mode however is not very good, the limited amount of waves and poor map design makes this gamemode unappealing. The last game had better escalation than this game, but overall it is semi-enoyable. Overall this game is worth buying, it will give you well over 25 hours of enjoyment (depending on how much you play the multiplayer) and I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of third-person shooters! 9/10","May 26, 2014","true","15.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I'm ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tting after some Jack Daniel's so stay with me for as long as you can.\n\nSo I really liked WFC, it had an amazing campaign much better than the usual ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t games we get. Picking up from rthe last game, robots escaping a dead planet and scavagening any energon they can find. Optimus searching for refuge and Megatron being a general d-bag and not letting them leave. I thought this was a prequel to G1 or Prime but as I've heard it's a game that leads in to the terribly developed, Rise of the Dark Spark, which is a horrendous tie-in with the Bayverse movies. How did that happen? I have no idea.\n\nCampaign was good, the storyline wasnt really much for me to remember as the first game was but the change in enviroment was great. One thing I absolutely loved was Metroplex, how often do we get to see that guy? How they managed to work him into the storyline was awesome. I would have liked to see some more characters though. Yes, playing as Optimus and Megatron is the primary focus but the side characters are just as important.\n\nI did not like how there was no choice in character for mission nor was there any co-op campaign. There seemed to be more fun with two other characters and also how they can help (aside from their meager dps). Focusing on one character seems to make it not only a little more challenging but almost personal even though we did have side conversation all along. As for co-op I was really disappointed. I had a lot of fun in co-op back in WFC so to see I can't enjoy the campaign with a friend really cuts back on a lot.\n\nNow High Moon did ♥♥♥♥ up. Again.\n\nI will give them props for at least being respectful enough for giving us DLC but they failed to even patch the game. I played WFC and FOC on Xbox when both released and did not run into as many problems as I did on this platform. I have run into several instances where I was freefalling out the map, stuck in the floor, had to navigate around invisible walls, and other game breaking glitches. I had to reset my game numerous times or wait for 10 minutes just to continue playing. Not only that but some game interactions don't even work, like when Megatron is in Soundwave's lab.\n\nI will stress this again like I did in my WFC review, don't play multiplayer. Don't play in a public game. The multiplayer community is still around but there are players using infinite shield, FPS unlocker, rapidfire, and other unfair hacks to ruin the game. And just like in the last game, High Moon will do nothing about it. This game was dropped as soon as it was released much like it's last game which is still very disappointing.\n\nRecommended for campaign use only.","February 11","true","84.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Because while the fast-paced-three dimensional shooting action is great, the single-player campaign is criminally short (heck I think it might even be shorter than "War"), after you start to have fun with one bot or con you're immediately switched to a different one with different abilities.  Multiplayer does sooth the disappointment somewhat, but it doesn't have the same awesome moments like Jazz grappling between sniper points or Vortex swooping down to blindside some Autobots.  If there was an in-between "meh" option I would pick that, although at it's current $50, my thumb is weighed downwards. If you can find it on a big sale, then you should probably get it, it's a blast while it lasts.","March 15, 2015","false","14.1"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

I finally got the game on sale. I remember War for Cybertron and recalled how that game was definitely NOT worth $60. When Fall of Cybertron went on sale I purchased a copy and jumped right in. Immediately I realized how much it resembled War for Cybertron. It is almost identical. Some things were improved and to a great extent. I LOVE the variety in multiplayer mode and it gives me hope that one day Transformers will have a place in the mass online gaming community, but I can't believe how many issues there are. Firstly, you cannot aim directly above you, which gives the scientist class an unfair advantage since they can hover directly over you. Nextly, invisible walls. Seriously, you glitch the hell out on these things, and there are a TON of them. I've died countless times because I've gotten stuck on what seemed to be nothing. After that there is the matter of team member collisions. When you so much as touch your team members you go FLYING off in some random direction or get stuck: especially if transforming around them. The only thing worse than that is you can't even play multiplayer because there are such few people who play the game. And even if you do get in a match you won't be able to play a whole match without "Host Migration" happening and ruining the whole match (causing you to forfeit all your EXP). There are many more problems in this game... like HACKERS. There are a ton of cheaters in this game and it makes multiplayer pointless. Overall there are just too many problems. If you can get a solid match in with honest players it can be very fulfilling. Fall of Cybertron is still NOT worth $60, considering TF2 is free to play and has far fewer problems in my opinion.\n\nSee my screenshots.","June 2, 2014","false","90.5"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

I loved War for Cybertron, waited a few years to play Fall of Cybertron, and once i started playing, feel right back into the groove of how the game plays.

You might find a small group on whenever steam does a decent sale on this game, but past that, no one plays the multiplayer anymore.\n\nReview on DLC:\nDLC is mostly for multiplayer, and the weapons arent that great. You will find better weapons in the game. I wouldnt advice buying any of it unless its bundled for a decent price, and even then I still wouldnt recommend it as its just a waste of space.\n\nAll in all, I would only recommend this game for people who only care about the campaign portion. I wouldnt pay full price for this game. Steam/Activision need to do a serious price drop on this game, as well as Rise of the Dark Spark, for the same reason due to the multiplayer in both games being dead, which makes the DLC useless.\n","December 26, 2015","false","20.6"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

The campaing is filled with pure adrenaline action and epic fights. You will be able to play as good and bad guys during whole campaing which is outstanding. You can collect currency to upgrade your guns or buy new ones as well as some perks which give you little bonuses during gameplay. The fights are unique and very well improved from predecessor. Transforming into vehicle is very rewarding and fun. Especially playing as Grimlock who can transform into T-Rex. Game also includes coop survival mode Escalation up to 3 players to fight off many waves of enemies and finally multiplayer is all fun. But because game is a bit old you won't see many people online. In summary it's a great game as previous but have some problems of it's own. PC port isn't good enough and devellopers dropped coop campaing which is really bad. In times textures won't load up so you have to restart checkpoint, and because of that game can't get big score. Outstanding performance, great soundtrack, great voice acting, nice graphics. Take it if you are a fan, and if not still give it a try. 8/10.","November 11, 2012","true","27.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I've loved the series for a while now and I loved this game's prequal, War for Cybertron. With that in mind I have to say I was very disappointed with this game. The campaign is very short while being still enjoyable (the best part of the game). It follows an interesting plot and rather engaging gameplay. The main problem I have with it is one, it's way too short. You can easily beat this game in about 5-6 hours. 7 max. Two, it's too gimmicky for its own good. The gunplay in it the game is rather nice but it feels like you never do it too often. Overall, I'd give the campaign a 6/10. The length really ruins it for me. Now let's move on the gosh-awful Multiplayer. Now, I want to reference War for Cybertron again and say that the Multiplayer in that game was incredible. Insanely fun, never really got boring, and some interesting maps. The only real problem was that it needed polish in some areas. In this game, however, they take out all those things that made War's so much fun. Most of the maps are very uninteresting with only two being really enjoyable. Another big problem is balancing, every class in the game, and I mean EVERY class has something that can be considered overpowered. It's no longer skill that wins games, it's who has the highest level, which is one of the biggest problems to me. The Multiplayer itself can also get very boring, some of the maps are way too big for the game types the game offers. Oh, and did I forget to mention there are only 4 game modes in this game with 2 of them being practically the same? There are also tons of hackers on the game.Now there is one last mode to talk about and that is Escalation. It's your standard "Zombies" or "Survival mode". It's a nice little take away and can be fun with friends but there are only 4 maps and only 15 waves which is disappointing.  Now, I'll recap all the things I said and, or, things I think are positive or negative. Please consider that this is just my own opinion so it may greatly differ form yours. Thank you.\n\nCampaign:6/10\n+Fantastic voice acting\n+Good gunplay (When it's used)\n+Creative level design\n+Great graphics (At max settings)\n-Way too short\n-Too many boring gimmicks\n-Not a very good sense of being a in a war\n\nMultiplayer:3/10\n-Very unbalanced\n-Full of hackers/cheaters\n-Uninteresting maps\n-Only four game modes\n+Great graphics (At max settings again)\n+More customization\n\nEscalation:5/10\n-Limited waves\n-Lacks charm\n-Only four maps\n+Fun distraction\n+Good sense of teamwork\n\nMy final verdict:4/10\nThis game could've been so much but falls so short in many areas. Either save your money (Espcially considering that this game is 60$) or, buy War for Cybertron.","January 3, 2014","false","94.7"," 44 of 92 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","44","92","0","14"

It took me four days to get bored of this game, and unfortunantly the campaign is better but ultimately doesn't have enough content to last a good run and support multiple playthroughs.

This year I held a TedX talk over at Monroe University in Chicahuaga California about the history of sci-fi over the last 100 years. I covered everything from the rise of pulp novels bringing about astonishing tales of virtue and valor as astronauts fought their way across the stars battling giant space squids and evil lamprey eels of death, to the modern epics of CGI mayhem brought to us in glorious HD-3D IMAX. One particular franchise I covered, was Transformers. You see, Transformerds has a colored history. It started in the 1940's as a way to sell toys to kids in a way that would also bolster interest in the American's upcoming space ventures, and continued on to become a staple of science fiction.\n\nMy issue with this game is based on its inherent disregard for the canon set by Michael Bay, which Hasbro(which I may remind you is the leading authority on Transformers since the 1940's pulp era) said in a public statement that the movie trilogy is a firm part of the Transformers canon. Now in the game Transformers Fall of Cybertron, the first thing I pointed out to my wife(god bless that ♥♥♥♥♥ Suzanne) is that Optimus Prime no longer looks like a chromed up god, but rather like the box covered idiot look from the 1940's, something that has clearly not aged well at all. Oh well, I considered it an artistic difference and moved on, but this occurs for ALL of the characters in the game. Listen up folks, if you're creating an IP and you set a canon up for people to adhere to, do not hire incompetent IDIOTS who will trash on that canon completely like the folks over at High Moon did. Secondly(and this is my biggest concern), Megatron dies on the third chapter. That's dumb, Megatron is crazy powerful and if you're going to kill him off, do it during an omnicron storyline so he can come back as Galvatron you IDIOTS. What's the point of Megatron dying for his people to the traitorous Optimus Prime(the Judas of this story) if he does not get revived by what is the god figure of this franchise? The whole mythology behind Transformers is Catholic, Mr. Bay understood this perfectly when he made his movies. High Moon Studios is a group of anti-religious nuts enforcing their Atheist ways on us god loving gamers.\n\nI cannot, I WILL NOT endorse this franchise ever again, not to my church gaming group, not to ANYBODY...

It would help if it had co-op, but oh well.\n\nNow, the multiplayer is GREAT, and is my favorite part of the game. It can be a bit hard at first, when u havent unlocked anything or have turned prime, but it adds to the challenge. And the character creation might even be my favorite part of the multiplayer, because of trying to create G1 characters and just seeing all of the cool combos u can make is AWESOME. But I wish that they still had your enemies drop their weapons when they die, like in WfC.\n\nEscalation is also boss, but i really wish that u could still pick any character instead of just four,but i see y they did that. Other than that, its a great game mode. i also wish that they still had unlimited levels, but i guess that it does help and make it a bit easier since there are 15 lvls.\n\nOverall, this game is AWESOME, and is probably my favorite game alongside its previous game, War for Cybertron. I really hope they make a third, but adding the good things from WfC that they left out in FoC. if they did that in a third game, that would probably be the best game ever.","October 9, 2012","true","329.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Sadly there are only twelve levels, but they make up for that by putting things in certain levels to find such as audio logs ( sound tracks of characters explaining the events, and such), and blueprints (collect these to unlock weapons and perks). The multiplayer mode is decent as far as gameplay. The gameplay is the same as the campaign\ngameplay.  The characters are pretty customizable except for the fact that only certain character loadouts can use certain weapons, vehicle modes, and perks. Some of the multiplayer maps are big and some are rather small. The multiplayer modes are mostly PVP oriented, but there is one mode where you can battle waves of enemies with other players.

I love the way you can transform but the best part is flying. The powerful weapons like the riot cannon has a great feel to it, especially when upgraded. This game lets you play as many characters which helps to keep your interest in the game up. Once you finish the game it unlocks weapons, it can be worth the second play threw to try those weapons and upgrade the rest of your favorate ones you may not have the cash for.\n\nThe weak points are how you get stuck moving forward rather than being able to go back threw that door you just went past. Some weapons aren't overly fun and some controls are a bit of a pain due to keybinding issues. (customizable computer mice will make the binding issues not so much of than issue).\n\nGot 24hrs in game play which is a lot for me, an over all fun shooter.","January 6, 2015","true","24.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

On top of all that I tend to be extremely critical. My criteria may be harsh but Fall of Cybertron is excellent. The game is a refreshing twist on the shooter genre as a whole, with the ability to switch weapon arms to shoot around cover, and the flawlessly integrated transformation mechanics. Vehicle alt-modes are surprisingly varied and, unlike most Transformer (and almost all other mech/robotic) games break from the mold of tanks, scouts and planes with only slightly different textures to distinguish them. I will say however that this is slightly damaged in the multiplayer due to an unfortunate, but probably unavoidable class system. Fortunately the game has an excellent character creation system that allows you to at least look unique. In terms of the campaign the game has been fantastic. The references and glimpses of past series and stories are plentiful, but have been worked in in such a ways that players new to the universe could have an hugely enjoyable experience without understanding them one bit. Then we get to perhaps my biggest praise: the characters. The characters in Fall of Cybertron are outstanding, the voice acting is fantastic and creates personas for essential characters and grunt soldiers a like. This is most true in the case of the Autobots; I genuinely felt a tinge of regret in the Decepticon missions killing Autobot soldiers. Their cheerful but nervous banter and yelled conversations made them seem like actual beings, I remember playing as Megatron and hearing one Autobot yell out "He can fly now?!?! That is not ok, THAT IS NOT OK!!!" as he retreated, the moment has so perfect and I can remember laughing and actually trying to keep this one enemy soldier alive. Overall it is a wonderful game that I would highly recomend, if I were to score it out of 10 (which I hate doing) I would give it a solid 9/10 (something I don't do lightly). My only real criticism is that the multiplayer hasn't retained an audience and tends to be quite empty, usually pitting newer players agianst much higher skill veterens.","January 6, 2015","true","32.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Here I am playing a videogame controling none other than Optimus Prime, and it's every bit as cool as I always dreamt it would be. I'm stomping around Cybertron, blasting Decepticons, turning into a truck and I feel in every way that the experince could not have made me 'feel' more like my childhood hero without implanting my conciousness into his robotic brain.\n\nHonestly if it sounds like I'm gushing, it's because I am. As a kid I discovered Transformers at about the perfect time and the franchise resonated with me in a big way.  As such, Transformers: Fall of Cybertron hit all the right notes and is exactly the sort of power fantasy my inner child has craved since Christmas of 1993, when a 5-year-old me unwrapped the coolest toy I would ever own, hands shaking from excitement: my very own Optimus Prime...\n\nMechanically I found Fall of Cybertron was kept engaging throughout by an ever-changing roster of playable characters. Each level presents you with at least one new character from the Transformers universe, each  feeling unique with their own combat mechanics and transformation mode. This ever changing set of toys to play with keeps the game fresh and interesting throughout and is Fall of Cybertron's most remarkable feature.\n\nOutside of this however, Fall of Cybertron gets a little less easy to enthuse over. Graphically the game is average, the enemy variety feels pretty lacking and the plot is exactly what you would expect from an 80s cartoon franchise designed to sell transforming robot toys: uninspired, kind of silly and rammed chock full of fan service. It must also be said that what I tried of the multiplayer mode I found a little dull, which was a shame, partially due to how few people I could find playing. I dare to say if you took away the Transformers licence from Fall of Cybertron you would simply be left with a competent but unremarkable 3rd person shooter I would be hard pressed to recommend to anyone.\n\nBut heres the important thing... It does have the Transformers licence. It's got it in truck loads, and it is the excellent - nay impeccible - implimentation of this licence that carries Fall of Cybertron from the pits of  mediocrity and makes it such a solidly enjoyable game.\n\nWould I recommend? Yes, if the thought of getting to be a Transformer sounds remotely exciting to you, then Transformers: Fall of Cybertron will not disappoint.\n\n\n\n","January 1, 2015","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sadly there are only twelve levels, but they make up for that by putting things in certain levels to find such as audio logs ( sound tracks of characters explaining the events, and such), and blueprints (collect these to unlock weapons and perks). The multiplayer mode is decent as far as gameplay. The gameplay is the same as the campaign\ngameplay.  The characters are pretty customizable except for the fact that only certain character loadouts can use certain weapons, vehicle modes, and perks. Some of the multiplayer maps are big and some are rather small. The multiplayer modes are mostly PVP oriented, but there is one mode where you can battle waves of enemies with other players.

The campaign mode is decently fun. you can earn credits to buy weapons and equip any weapon to any character. Sadly there are only twelve levels, but they make up for that by putting things in certain levels to find such as audio logs ( sound tracks of characters explaining the events, and such), and blueprints (collect these to unlock weapons and perks). The multiplayer mode is decent as far as gameplay. The gameplay is the same as the campaign\ngameplay.  The characters are pretty customizable except for the fact that only certain character loadouts can use certain weapons, vehicle modes, and perks. Some of the multiplayer maps are big and some are rather small. The multiplayer modes are mostly PVP oriented, but there is one mode where you can battle waves of enemies with other players.

The quality of the campaign has benefitted immensely from the removal of co-op like the last game had, which at first was a controversial decision by the devs but turned out to be the best possible choice. I had an absolute blast playing as racecars, tanks, helicopters, jets, giant bots, dinosaurs, and even grunts as I sneaked around with cloaking devices, grappled through aerial fortresses, crossed swords with decepticons, stepped on autobots, incinerated leapers, dogfought (is that a word?) with enemy planes, *SPOILERS*ate shockwave,*END SPOILERS* I could go on. For a long time. Needless to say the campaign was awesome and I will be playing it through several times again. The multiplayer portion of the game does not fare so well; I failed to see any improvement in the competitive or cooperative survival modes, and at any time you try to play you will either a) only find hackers or b) not find anyone at all. It's a shame HMS and Activision wont get their act together on support, I'd boycott them but unfortunately I have too much fun on their games to bother. There I said it, I'm a horrible PC gamer...  but I'm a great TF fan.

I would recommend this game very much even to non-transformers fans, you guys I gonna love it. This game has a very fun and cool campaign with a very interesting and unexpecting storyline. The only thing different from Transformers WFC is that it has no Co-Op mode but, they improve the character customization system for multiplayer which is AWSOME! You customize your character from head to leg. Multiplayer was really fun and competitive they did a very great job improving the game.\n\nSuggestions:\nThere are some improvements that can be made to make the game (or future versions of it) even more awsome. Firstly I like the color system in Transformers WFC where you can pick the colors as well as the different tones of it I wish the color system can be brought back with even more colors. Secondly,  since character customization is for us customize a Transformers to make it our very own, I was hoping that we can Decepticon colors and Autobots colors for both factions because some colors like White and Black are used mostly in both Autobots and Decepticons. I was also hoping that we can customize any Transformers for any class so that we can have for example Ratchet as the Scientist class, Scout class, Leader class or Titan class as well as weapons being available for all classes. Thirdly, I still love how Transformers WFC where we get to customize both the Autobot and the Decepticon for every slot (Scout 1, Scout 2, Scout 3) because in Transformers FOC, we can only customize the character and then choose an Autobot color and a Decepticon color instead of customizing one unique Autobot and one Unique Decepticon. I hope you can take my suggestions for consideration to make the game better. I know you guys put a lot of effort into this game just that some very good stuffs were remove.\n\nOthers:\nI heard that Transformers ROTDS was quite a failure because of the fact that you guys removed multiplayer from the game. The storyline was not very well done because of merging 2 different Transformers universe together. I was hoping that you guys can release a DLC for Transformers ROTDS that removes all the earth missions and replace it with new cybertron missions and show how the dark spark was destroyed. I understand the cybertron missions take place between WFC and FOC I was hoping that you can link the 3 together as well as bringing back multiplayer and character customization. By removing the earth missions, I hope a a new game base on the movie Transformers AOE can be made seperately from Transformers ROTDS. I think people would pay and extra sum of money for the DLC just to get a better game. I hope you guys can consider it.

The co-op is gone, the levels are much more linear, and the Transformation gimmick is much less useful here.\n\nThere is quite a variety of play styles beyond the standard over-the-shoulder shooter levels, such as stealth sections, rooftop sniping, flying through giant chasms, and giant-robot-dinosaur beat-em-ups, but they all only happen once or twice before being shoved away more more boring levels. There are many good ideas that only happen once and are never touched on again and they are unsatisfyingly short and easy due to their one-off nature. Grimlock himself is probably the biggest disappointment of all since you only play as him for one level at the very end.\n\nThe multiplayer sucks as well since it has that dreadful Call of Duty time sink xp system. Basically, you start with a few guns, and as you spend more time playing, you unlock more, but it takes so damn long to unlock anything and you're at the mercy of players who have far more options than you because they have more weapon because you can't play this game for 8 hours a day. Also the Dinobots are DLC, which is a real slap in the face since they were practically the most hyped part of the game. Thankfully, you shouldn't have to worry about any of these problems because the online is dead and there's no local multiplayer or co-op.\n\nThis game is only for hardcore transformers fans who like the brand more than they do fun, so if you're okay with a boring game with a nonsensical plot with ugly levels and lame multiplayer just because it says Transformers on it, then you already own this. Everyone else should avoid.","April 18, 2013","false","12.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphic quality is good, the controls feel nice and smooth, and it is not as bad on the health bar as it was for War For Cybertron. The multiplayer part of this game is okay, but could be worked on, for PS3 version. The plot runs smoothly and I liked how they presented the first playable part of the game. I highly recommend this game to any Transfan or someone new to the series to play it, but you should play War For Cybertron first even though it can induce a rage quite here and there, it will help in the long run, trust me.","December 4, 2015","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For some reason the multiplayer customisation only has half of the colours now and for some reason the game doesn't have the CGI trailer to view anymore.\n\nThere's numerous unlocking glitches such as the weapons you are supposed to get after finishing the campaign not appearing as well as many achievments not popping up. These however are not terribly influential on how good the game is, I just feel that these issues need to be addressed.\n\nThe campaign is fantastic, really giving off a feel of the Transformers world with memorable characters and great voice acting. It was a little confusing how much they deviate from the G1 continuity as War For Cybetron made me think they were prequels to the cartoon.\n\nNot much is happening on the multiplayer now but it has been out for a good few years now so a drop in full sessions is to be expected.\n\nIf you get this game for anything, get it for the campaign. If you're a Transformers fan you shouldn't be disappointed.","November 28, 2015","true","10.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As a fan of the cartoons from back in the day, and a hater of the new films (they ruined every character design, and I mean EVERY) I expected this to be more new style than old.\n\nYet somehow those who made this game managed to 'improve' the designs, yet keeping to each characters true design and stylings. This game is a prequel to what most people know (I've only 'watched' the first film so they may have told you more than I believe). So seeing the autobots in the homeworld states is kind of cool.\n\nAs for the game itself I didn't expect such a fairly solid shooting mechanic, instead of sticking to a corner to and it peering around, you change your gun arm to give better viewing while remaining well covered. The weapons are varied and very cool. There are upgrades for both robot and vehicle form. And so far all the major names appear to be making appearences.\n\nI am not all that far, only in chapter four of thirteen. But so far there has been hold and fight sections, stealth sections (optional), side sections to search for the blueprints / logs if you want to do them.

Yes, it really is a transformers game, this master piece was just created with the love of transformers from High Moon Studios. Every minute of the game was just satisfying, capiagn doesn't have co-op but it's for the better trust me. They included everything like the combaticons, insecticons, dinobots, and much more, but not only that but High Moon Studios made Fall of Cybertron better in everyway then the previous title War for Cybertron. I can go on and on about why this is worth the money, however, transformers fan or not you will love this game if. If you are not a transformers fan before you buy this, i promise you will be after you finish the game. 10/10","June 29, 2014","true","34.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The campaign mode is decently fun. you can earn credits to buy weapons and equip any weapon to any character. Sadly there are only twelve levels, but they make up for that by putting things in certain levels to find such as audio logs ( sound tracks of characters explaining the events, and such), and blueprints (collect these to unlock weapons and perks). The multiplayer mode is decent as far as gameplay. The gameplay is the same as the campaign\ngameplay.  The characters are pretty customizable except for the fact that only certain character loadouts can use certain weapons, vehicle modes, and perks. Some of the multiplayer maps are big and some are rather small. The multiplayer modes are mostly PVP oriented, but there is one mode where you can battle waves of enemies with other players.

It would help if it had co-op, but oh well.\n\nNow, the multiplayer is GREAT, and is my favorite part of the game. It can be a bit hard at first, when u havent unlocked anything or have turned prime, but it adds to the challenge. And the character creation might even be my favorite part of the multiplayer, because of trying to create G1 characters and just seeing all of the cool combos u can make is AWESOME. But I wish that they still had your enemies drop their weapons when they die, like in WfC.\n\nEscalation is also boss, but i really wish that u could still pick any character instead of just four,but i see y they did that. Other than that, its a great game mode. i also wish that they still had unlimited levels, but i guess that it does help and make it a bit easier since there are 15 lvls.\n\nOverall, this game is AWESOME, and is probably my favorite game alongside its previous game, War for Cybertron. I really hope they make a third, but adding the good things from WfC that they left out in FoC. if they did that in a third game, that would probably be the best game ever.","October 9, 2012","true","329.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Games like war, fall and the new one, transformers devastation, have done something new to keep their games fresh. But ignore rise of the dark spark, that game is a cash in, that trys to rip off what made this game so great. But lets talk about this game. Sadly i think this game is the last, we will see high moon make a transformers game, since the games ending actually ties into the g1 story.  But besides that if you don't know already, transformers fall of cybertron is the game after the game war for cybertron. Just to let you know so you can buy war for cybertron first, and then this game. When you start fall of cybertron, play the campaign. The campaign is great, and besides. What game has metroplex in it!! A freaking g1 city former making its entrance in modern games. If you played war you can tell the game has changed. I believe double jumping is the thing in the past. But i can push that away. Another weird thing is that optimus changed him mold or body, but its never explained. But you can forget that fact.  I am not going to spoil the story in sake of the review, but you probably know that metroplex is going to be in it, from all the hyped trailers that came out. Its good that transformers campaigns are great since this is how you are probably going to remember them. Plus i haven't played multiplayer on pc but i have on the 360. And lets face it, the game is becoming old and will proabably have a bunch of cheaters in it. So i don't recommend playing multiplayer at all on pc. But you should try escalation. Its good but why is it capped at level 15? In war you can go up to unlimited rounds but who cares i guess. I mostly played it for the campaign and the fan service is there. I am still playing this in 2016 and i still enjoy it, so is that saying something. Well i am a transformers fan, but i think that you should try it out anyway.","January 2","true","10.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is amazing for any Transformer fan, which you're probably hearing a lot about from other reviews, and for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ good reason.\n\nSad thing about this game is as of today, the Multiplayer is dead, from my 7 hours of playing as I write this I have only had one full match of Escalation--the games horde mode. But enough just chatting about the game, lets list the Pros and Cons\n\nPros:\n- Great level variety\n- Diverse enemies, engaging combat\n- Weapon upgrade system through Teletran-1\n- Replay value is great\n- Play as multiple characters in Campaign and in Multiplayer\n\nMultiplayer Pros:\n- Create your own Autobot or Decepticon\n- Good progression system\n- DLC is actually worth purchasing, and is not pay to win by any means\n- Decent amount of modes\n\nCons:\n- No Co-op campaign (not a major con, but if you liked it WFC then you may miss having it like me)\n- There are some bugs/glitches (For me was Eye of the Storm had level loading problems, wait for a few minutes near Jazz for it to fix.)\n\nMultiplayer Cons:\n- Multiplayer is overall dead\n- Progression to Max level Prime is time consuming\n- Escalation can become bland quickly, dispite the many different maps\n\nIn conclusion, great game and still holds up to this day. So glad my nostalgia for this is not just me being an idiot :P\n\n","December 26, 2015","true","18.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You will see many Autobots/Decepticons throughout the storyline that we all grew up with watching after school on tv, and it's great being able to play as them in this awesome game that "High Moon Studios" has blessed us all with!

High Moon Studios has managed to craft an engaging, emotional and entertaining game centered around giant transforming robots, which really shouldn't be hard. As it stands, Fall of Cybertron is definitely the best Transformers game ever made, and is also one of the best shooters out there, period.\n\nFall of Cybertron is visually astonishing. The environments are huge and varied, with a large amount of color variation and imaginative design. Characters have incredibly amounts of detail: gears whirr, guns pulse with ammunition, and panels shift on character models, even when they're idle. When they move, joints shift and pump, and guns fire a variety of bright and gleaming projectiles. The wonderfully unique enemies spark and blaze as they come apart, and transformation sequences showcase enormous amounts of detail that leaves you stunned when the animation ends.\n\nThe music is fantastic, showcasing some satisfying electirc guitar beats for the action-packed moments, alongside some excellent synth tracks and atmospheric pieces for when things quiet down. All of the voice work is on par with the best triple-A RPGs, and some of the original voice cast was recruited for the game (Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime is godlike).\n\nThe story goes in some truly unexpected directions and gets surprisingly heavy at times. The early missions wouldn’t be out-of-place in the grittiest “war-is-hell” game/movie/book/documentary, and the game isn’t afraid to get realistic with the consequences of a civil war between transforming robots on a cybernetic planet. The final few missions don’t quite live up to the rest of the game’s narrative excellence, but that’s only due to how sudden the ending feels and the ambiguity regarding the fate of the Dinobots.\n\nThe game’s combat is fantastic. Using the shift key to dodge and sprint took a while to get used to, but it feels natural after a few levels. Guns are satisfying and varied, with a Transformers twist on familiar staples in the genre. While the upgrade system starts of dull (you’re going to get really sick of increasing your movement speed while scoped), the late-tier upgrades are phenomenally unique, powerful, and fun to get. I could have done with a few more levels of upgrades considering that each gun only gets between two to four, but it’s still exciting to level them up.\n\nFinding the hidden blueprints to make new guns won’t be a problem unless you never explore, but there was one exception: a bug during Cliffjumper’s mission prevented the final blueprint from spawning, and I had to replay that level a few times to get it to work.\n\nEnemies are extremely aggressive and intelligent. Basic soldiers hide behind cover, flush you out with grenades, and move if you start to advance, but they’re just the tip of the iceberg.  Shotgun Decepticons and Autobots rush you at incredible speed, only taking cover if you’re particularly far away, and dive backwards into cover if you try to close the gap. Snipers rapidly switch between vantage points, and that’s still not all of them. The enemies take the already interesting arsenal and make you use to it its full capability on anything except the easiest difficulty.\n\nIn an example of something I really wish wasn’t astonishing but is due to the poor pedigree of previous Transformers games (Excluding War for Cybertron), the game has, finally, managed to capture the essence of Transformers in a way that makes it unlike a standard third-person shooter: transformation is now a vital part of combat. As enemies reposition themselves, Optimus Prime could dance around, avoiding their fire as he waits for them to expose themselves, or he could transform and ram into them to finish the job.\n\nUsing the mouse to move around feels strange at first, but after getting in aerial dogfights that felt like they were straight out of a flight combat game or kiting enemies while I peppered them with vehicular rockets, I wouldn’t have it any other way. The game’s smooth integration of each interlocking system allows for such incredible feats as being able to scream forward at top speed as Jazz, jump, transform in midair, grapple onto a ledge, and lock onto and snipe an enemy in the span of less than six seconds.\n\nOn that note, the game also distinguishes itself with the huge amount of variety. Every single level, and sometimes multiple times within the same level, you switch to a new character with a whole new set of abilities. This transition, with only three exceptions in the cases of Starscream, Soundwave, and  Bumblebee  always feels natural, and only in those exceptions does it feel like you didn’t spend enough time with certain characters. New enemy types are introduced as you play new characters, but even with regards to enemies you’ve fought before, your character’s new stature, vehicle form, special ability and possible armament means you need to change how you fight them. For example,  Insecticons  are huge threats to Jazz even in small numbers, but Grimlock can literally just walk on them. It's a bit of a shame that character's don't have unique melee attacks, though.\n\nFall of Cybertron is one of the best action games I’ve ever played, and one of my favorite games ever, period. It combines excellent storytelling, audio, visuals, combat and other underlying systems to craft an experience unlike any other I’ve ever played.\n\nNow if only Activision would finally listen to my THREE WEEKS of trying to get technical support and let me play the ♥♥♥♥ing multiplayer.\n\nPros Excellent visuals, whether it's character models or environment design\nFantastic voice acting and music\nEngaging, varied combat\nUpgrade system is great fun\nHuge number of playable characters that are each fun and used well\nInteresting characters and surprisingly emotional story\nVehicle form is actually really useful and importantCons Ending is kind of sudden and the last few story missions try to wrap up things a little too quickly\nStarscream, Soundwave and Bumblebee aren't playable for as long as I'd like\nThey didn't quite capture Grimlock's style of speech as well as I'd like, and one of the Dinobots is killed off with little ceremony\nWhy can't I play the ♥♥♥♥ING Multiplayer?","February 20","true","22.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

High Moon deserves proper support from the gaming community for treating the subject material of so many of our childhoods with proper respect (unlike certain movies I could name).  If you are kind of indifferent about the franchise it is still a very solid 3rd person action game worthy of your time and money.","December 3, 2012","true","31.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Games like war, fall and the new one, transformers devastation, have done something new to keep their games fresh. But ignore rise of the dark spark, that game is a cash in, that trys to rip off what made this game so great. But lets talk about this game. Sadly i think this game is the last, we will see high moon make a transformers game, since the games ending actually ties into the g1 story.  But besides that if you don't know already, transformers fall of cybertron is the game after the game war for cybertron. Just to let you know so you can buy war for cybertron first, and then this game. When you start fall of cybertron, play the campaign. The campaign is great, and besides. What game has metroplex in it!! A freaking g1 city former making its entrance in modern games. If you played war you can tell the game has changed. I believe double jumping is the thing in the past. But i can push that away. Another weird thing is that optimus changed him mold or body, but its never explained. But you can forget that fact.  I am not going to spoil the story in sake of the review, but you probably know that metroplex is going to be in it, from all the hyped trailers that came out. Its good that transformers campaigns are great since this is how you are probably going to remember them. Plus i haven't played multiplayer on pc but i have on the 360. And lets face it, the game is becoming old and will proabably have a bunch of cheaters in it. So i don't recommend playing multiplayer at all on pc. But you should try escalation. Its good but why is it capped at level 15? In war you can go up to unlimited rounds but who cares i guess. I mostly played it for the campaign and the fan service is there. I am still playing this in 2016 and i still enjoy it, so is that saying something. Well i am a transformers fan, but i think that you should try it out anyway.","January 2","true","10.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For some reason the multiplayer customisation only has half of the colours now and for some reason the game doesn't have the CGI trailer to view anymore.\n\nThere's numerous unlocking glitches such as the weapons you are supposed to get after finishing the campaign not appearing as well as many achievments not popping up. These however are not terribly influential on how good the game is, I just feel that these issues need to be addressed.\n\nThe campaign is fantastic, really giving off a feel of the Transformers world with memorable characters and great voice acting. It was a little confusing how much they deviate from the G1 continuity as War For Cybetron made me think they were prequels to the cartoon.\n\nNot much is happening on the multiplayer now but it has been out for a good few years now so a drop in full sessions is to be expected.\n\nIf you get this game for anything, get it for the campaign. If you're a Transformers fan you shouldn't be disappointed.","November 28, 2015","true","10.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
