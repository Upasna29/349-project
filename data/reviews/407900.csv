A rare example of great aesthetic and warm fuzzy feelings being supported by gameplay that non only just doesn't suck, but is actually really good! Princess Remedy is a game that could easily be described as "a poor man's Undertale", and to an extent, that's true-it being a bullet hell/RPG mash up with retro inspired graphics about making friends-but it's an incredible game all on it's own that even predates Undertale by nearly a year.

I really enjoyed the game for what it is, from wandering town to town in the overworld map, finding treasure to upgrade your powers, health and abilities, heck I even enjoyed the battles, A few of them were really difficult, more so than even the final boss!\n\nYou play as Remedy, pretty much a magical space nurse and its your job to heal the prince, you have to get to him first though. The world is inhabited by many, many people in distress that can also use your healing help!

I didn't have any idea what to expect when I started it up, but I was instantly won over by its charming sense of humor. The game itself isn't bad either. It's designed very much in the spirit of old Spectrum computer games, but it has enough modern sensibilities to appeal to all kinds of gamers.\n\nIt'd be enough to simply have a game, where you blast away the pain troubling the inhabitants of Hurtland, but PRIAWOH goes the extra mile by having proper mechanics. Yep, the developer actually cared enough about their free game to have a proper hit-box for the heroine, so that she doesn't take a bunch of damage, just by kinda sorta brushing up against an enemy. A lot of games that cost money, and require way more of our limited time, don't even get this most important aspect right.\n\nWhen the game is over, you get to decide who Princess Remedy marries. There are over 60 possible candidates, and they all have an amusing comment at the end. Sometimes it's the little touches that matter most, They remind me that buried deep under miles of ocean, rocks, and lava; I have something that could pass for a heart.\n\nI guess the only replay-value is in trying to beat your best time, but it's no big deal. This is a game you play through once and retain nothing but pleasant memories about it. Maybe you'll tell your friends about it and share the love.","April 2","true","0.8"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

It is crime that this game is free — I want to buy it.\n\nYou can call this game “one-stick healer”: you play as a princess wandering through the little world populated only with ill creatures. And you are healing them with magic in an one-stick shooter sequences. It’s very short but nice, charming and a little nostalgic experience. Hell, I have spent more time writing this review than clearing the game (~1.0 hour), and you've probably spent more time reading reviews, when you can just play the damn game instead (it free).\n\nGameplay: You wander around a small world, open chests and heal different characters. Healing is simple: after a small dialog with an ill NPC, you will appear in the arena with enemies and obstacles. Objectives: do not die, dodge bullets and shoot every enemy. During healing sequences the princess is always shooting where she is directed at, making it a "one stick shooter". It's a little tricky and you should always keep it in mind. When everything (except you) is dead, NPC is healed. And after you defeated the final boss you can marry them.\n\nStory: go to the Hurtland, practice your healing skills and find yourself a husband (or wife).\n\nCharacter: In the end, you can marry every-bloody-thing and get an exclusive ending for it. Which is lovely.\n\n\nP.S.

Delving with mad joy into the pain-filled microcosmos of each, she pounds their sicknesses (everything from broken-heartedness to death to not enough spider legs) into submission with a never-ending barrage of divine pharmaceuticals -- the speed at which she nimbly flits about these painscapes proving to every awestruck eye that those pleasantly plump thighs house thews of spring steel.  One is struck with an even deeper admiration for Princess Remedy when, quest completed, she stands revealed to all as a pansexual; what singularity of purpose must have driven her onward when every man, woman, centaur, zombie, rock and tree beckoned her ever-burning loins to amorous dalliance!\n\nWhy is this game free?  I'm not the only gamer who would have gladly paid for admission into this world so deftly wired-together from the phosphorescent bones ransacked from a ZX Spectrum graveyard.

Princess Remedy was my favorite game of the jam, it has some cameos from ludoverse characters and some silly dialoge. It is short, Having beaten it like 2-3 times prior it took me about 1hr to 101% it on normal (there are 2 hard difficultes now). 3 save is a nice touch to. I recommend talking to everyone in the first area to get the controls down. Word of advice, after you beat the boss the game goes into that marry mode people were talking about, all cured NPCs will just ask if you want to marry them (and ever single one has a little bit of added flavor text for the ending) so if you want to hear what a cured or health character says be sure to talk to them before that final boss battle.\n\nAll and all this is basically a Quality of Life update to a fun little 3-day game jam game. If you take it slow and talk to people you will likely get maybe around 3 hours. For free it is a good way to kill some time on a lazy weekend afternoon.

It was a little hard for me to get used to the buttons at first, since every button was just about the action button other than the arrow keys. But once I got the hang of it I really began enjoying it. The story was simple, but it still pulled me in enough to finish it. The gameplay is about an hour long depending on how well you do. The art is cute, it's simple as well, but it has a very 80's aesthetic vibe about it. With the retro colors, and nicely done music....for a game made in 4 days, this is a very well done game. It even had my scratching my head a few times when I couldn't get certain fights and I'd try redoing them. But yes I definitely recommend this game.

How?\n\nI played the 48 Hour jam version (which i believe didn't have the difficulty settings), and immediately, with my 5 hours in game maker pro went "I'm going to port this."\nWelp, i'm sorry whoever was in charge that day, because i, of course, never came through (because porting from GM7, to GMS is the hardest thing you will ever do.) He did end up telling me they were thinking about putting it on Steam themselves, though.\n\nIn case you are wondering, i got to after the intro cutscene, before the game refused to work.\n\nAnyway, review time:\nStory: You play as princess remedy, helping cure diseases so you can become queen, and to find a suitable prince. Armed with magic bandaids and  Death Grenades  healing flasks, you must heal everyone in the World of Hurt. Very simple plot, but it does the job.\n\nGameplay:  This is an Action RPG/Cute em up with no leveling or random encounters. Instead, you walk into the villiage or special area (Marked by a discolorment in the terrain), talk to people, animals, or random out of place stuff like flowers, and fight thier illnesses. after that, you get a permanent powerup. you can also find these permanent powerups in chests. The stat you need to progress is HP, as that opens gates to new areas. all fights are enjoyable with a fair enemy variety that never feels cheap, and if you die no loading screens or nothing, so you can just talk to the person/thing and get right back into the fray!  also, the final, unique boss,  Not Kefka, really fits the charm of the game.\n\nMusic/Visuals: Do thier job, were intentionally simple so they could make a complete game in 48 hours. Menu music is incredible though.\n\nCureently thinking about making a youtube playthrough of this game on mastery mode. It's REALLY GOOD, could be seen as up there with Undertale, and is Free. I completed the game 5 times in the 48 hour version, and i'm one to only play a game once.\n\nGET THIS GAME/10.","January 5","true","6.3"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","7","10","3","0"

And maybe fix up the rest of Hurtland along the way.\nGameplay is very simple, and only directional buttons and an action button are required. You simply enter various towns and caves from the overworld, and talk to sick-looking NPCs. To cure them, you must clear a small top-down shooter minigame, launching bandages at personifications of various ailments. (Unfortunately, you can only fire in the direction you are facing, but I suppose this can be attributed to style.)\nEach minigame you clear and person you heal will earn you another hit point, and various other upgrades like shot power and regeneration can be found in chests throughout the world. You'll need them, as the germs and creatures you fight will get progressively stronger. Don't worry, though- If you fail a heal-fight, you can try again with no penalty.\nThe game has some amusing visuals and a lot of funny dialogue- most of the people you heal are grappling with some sort of silly condition, like a ghost who's scared of himself and a centaur who is worried because he believes he is real. (This is reminiscient of other games from the same folks, such as Ittle Dew- the protagonists of which make a cameo in this game.)\nFinally, the heavily retro graphics may look off-putting at first, but I got used to them quickly and soon enjoyed the old-fashioned feel. I also found them to be much more colorful and identifiable than I was expecting- definitely more so than the majority of the old stuff they take inspiration from.\nOverall, Princess Remedy is a quick jaunt that is absolutely worth an hour or so of your time. My only complaint is that it's free-to-play, so I can't have it permanently associated with my account.","May 13","true","0.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You explore a world in a 3rd person view similar to Breath Of Fire and Pokemon; in which you open chests to obtain objects that help advance your stats, and initiating "battles" passively when you encounter a sick NPC.The battles are known as "Healing mode" in which you face off enemy viruses by controlling the direction your princess moves and also where she fires "medicine". Another "weapon" you have are flasks which can be thrown as grenades. Enemies range from non-moving patches to gliding ghosts that shoot stuff at you, trying to cut down your health bar. In later levels, the amount of enemy fire thrown your way could easily pass for a bullet- hell game.\nThe dialogue is hillarious with NPCs giving various funny reasons for their sicknesses and the ending offers many, many possibilities.\nTotally would reccommend. Has great playback value too, really suprised that it's free.\nIt's short, and I was able to finish it with a 100% completion rate in around 50 minutes.","January 21","true","2.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

You explore a world in a 3rd person view similar to Breath Of Fire and Pokemon; in which you open chests to obtain objects that help advance your stats, and initiating "battles" passively when you encounter a sick NPC.The battles are known as "Healing mode" in which you face off enemy viruses by controlling the direction your princess moves and also where she fires "medicine". Another "weapon" you have are flasks which can be thrown as grenades. Enemies range from non-moving patches to gliding ghosts that shoot stuff at you, trying to cut down your health bar. In later levels, the amount of enemy fire thrown your way could easily pass for a bullet- hell game.\nThe dialogue is hillarious with NPCs giving various funny reasons for their sicknesses and the ending offers many, many possibilities.\nTotally would reccommend. Has great playback value too, really suprised that it's free.\nIt's short, and I was able to finish it with a 100% completion rate in around 50 minutes.","January 21","true","2.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

The new features (controller support, more difficulty modes and options) are nice quality of life additions but as far as content goes it appears to be the same as the version I have sitting on my desktop. This game is still as cute and fun as I remember it to be.)\n\n-\n\nPrincess Remedy is one of the 6 or so games to come out of the recent Games Against Ebola game jam. The other games haven't been released to the public but fortunately for you and I, the fine folks at Ludosity have released it for free!\n\nThe game puts you in the role of the titular Princess Remedy, who has been sent on a mission from her home planet of Saturn to heal all the sick people in Hurtland! The various peoples of Hurtland have many ailments, ranging from sick burns to an actual lack of a body. What I'm getting at is that it's a Ludosity game. It's got their trademark playful writing and has some cameos from characters from a couple of their other games too.\n\nDespite being made in less than 4 days the game has some solid gameplay. When you heal people you go inside their bodies(?) and blast their troubles away with your Saturnian healing magic. You're constantly shooting, so you only need to focus on dodging enemies and their bullets. After you heal someone you get a heart, which increases your max health in healing mode and are also used to unlock doors to other areas. There are also other upgrades you can find in the overworld that increase your damage, the number of shots you shoot, health regen and the amount of flasks (bombs) you can carry.\n\nOh, and at the end of the game you are given the option to literally marry anyone you've healed over the course of the game. It comes straight out of left-field but it's still a neat addition since there are about 30+ characters to choose from. That's like 30 different endings! I love everything about this game and I kinda wish they would expand this game into something longer. I'm 1000% sure they probably won't but I can dream can't I?","January 6","true","0.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But, in that 25 minutes of play time that I have sunk into it, I already have plenty of gripes with this game. First off, I am not a fam of the art style. I understand that they were going for something out of the normal pixel graphics indie game loop with something looking commorore/NES-esque graphical style, but it just does not work for me. Second, the difficulty spike in the beginning of the game is too much too fast. It doesn't take long to get used to, but it's so sudden I had a hard time getting used to it. But, with those problems, the game still has an unmatchable charm that is very difficult to find in most games nowadays. The music is some of the best I have heard in a long time, up there with games like Mega Man and NieR in my opinion. The gameplay is very enjoyable, combining a sort of action-rpg and bullet hell style that has plenty of problems, but is still a ton of fun to play with. The humour in this game is done very well, using plenty of references, puns, and portmanteaus to drive home the point that Ludosity wanted to make a funny game without being crude and offensive. Finally, the characters. Play for yourself to see what I mean by that. All in all, Princess Remedy is a fun little game that definitely deserves to be given a try.","May 29","true","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Now, I won't say this game is perfect. It's not especially in depth and the combat system was maybe a little ~too~ simple, but for a game that was put together in four days (for charity, I might add), it's pretty freakin' good.\n\nBasically, imagine if a multi-directional shooter like Berzerk or Robotron 2084 was given an overworld. That's this game in a nutshell. The first thing you're going to notice is that this game looks like something released on the ZX Spectrum or the Amstrad CPC in the 80's, and considering you only have the directional keys and "action button" to work with, that's not a bad description of how it plays. In all honesty, the idea of that had me a bit wary at first, even in spite of the already mostly positive reviews it was getting. Don't get me wrong, I love retro and retro-styled games, but the simplicity of Princess Remedy put me off a little at first.\n\nBut of course the game was free, so I figured "why not?"\n\nI'm happy to say that the simplicity ends up working in its favor. While yes, I wish the combat system had a few more options, the game plays very smoothly even with a single button. And the graphics, while basic, are well-crafted and fun to look at (especially the titular character's portrait- she is just TOO cute).\n\nBasically, this is a game that could have gone very wrong, but exceeded my expectations. So I'll be buying the sequel when it comes out, because I'm all for seeing more of Princess Remedy's adventures.","June 2","true","2.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's so simple but the devs did a fantastic job of giving each area variation and each enemy formation is a fresh challenge. Each and every chest has upgrades to make this easier with more powerful pills, more flasks per battle, more health, more recovery, and more shots fired at once.\n\nPlus, the graphics are colorful and nice to look at while making everything as recognizable as it needs to be.\nFully reccomended.","May 31","true","1.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That's about all that can be said, really. It may have dome out before Undertale, but that's what it is. Anything else is just repeating stuff from an Undertale summary and saying "it's less impressive than it sounds" or "it's worse than how Undertale did it".\n\nThe only really neat idea is that at the end of the game, you can "marry" any of the npc's insofar. This doubles their lines, but there's still only 4 per character so you aren't missing much. There's so many characters that the two-or-three lines that each one has isn't enough for them to really go anywhere worth dedicating an hour too, either.

The main difference between this and those other games is that your shots fire automatically and if you press the action button you fling a flask that has a blast radius and can either take out obstacles in fights or deal significant damage to enemies. The further you go, the more the enemies begin to fire shots like you're in a bullet hell shooter but it's not difficult to avoid enemy fire.\n\nThe only thing I could think of that would improve the game is if there were a strife button/option since you only move in the direction you press and it would make taking out enemies easier.\n\nThis game definitely deserves to be paid for instead of being free. I would gladly pay to own this game if I could.\n\nIt's short, it's sweet, it's free, definitely worth checking out, it's "Princess Remedy in a World of Hurt".","January 9","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The concept is pretty clear: you are a healer, so go around the kingdom, save people and save the princess. The "battle" machanics are pretty fun, just shoot, void, throw the flask if necessary and do not die. Sounds easy but it gets kind of hard, not much.

But, at least the game is actually good, so it makes giving it a thumbs up easy for me.\n\nPrincess Remedy followed Princess Remedy as she goes to Hurtland and heals everyone living in it. The story is pretty repetitive, as you just walk around, talk to a monster, fight the virus, then talk to them again. There are plenty of exploration options though, as there are some pretty decently-laid secrets (but some are just flat-out obvious). The gameplay is honestly what kept me playing for so long. It's basically like the fight against Mettaton in Undertale, where in you dodge random sh**, while shooting said sh**. It does start out simple, but as you continue the viruses you fight get harder and harder... except for the boss. He was surpsingly easy. Really, really easy. But the gameplay is still enjoyable. For a game made by so few people, it sounds well and looks fine (almost like Link's Awakening if it were made for Atari).\n\nAgain, the graphics aren't perfect. There's very little actual animation in the world of Hurtland, the process of talking to people to find out a punch line after beating their virus gets old after a while. But the exploration and combat are incredibly satisfying to fully delve into. Princess Remedy isn't perfect, but it is fun and it's an enjoyable way to kill an hour or so.","February 8","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(I have a thing for anything with a retro vibe.) I am not disappointed at all with the game.\n\nAt first, the game does seem a bit repeatitive. Basically, you've been sent down to hurtland to heal people and objects, then you hve to save your friend. First, you're thinking okay this has been done a thousands times. You start playing and then you say this game is rather easy. As you keep playing the levels get harder. When I say the levels get harder; I mean you may find some frustration with the difficulty. If playing on Normal the hard levels are hard, I can only imagine playing those same levels on Hard and Master; would be insane.\n\nThe controls using the keyboard are pretty simple. Your traditonal arrows keys and your action button which is enter, shift, control and a few other keys that I can't remember because it's simpler to use the enter key.\n\nI haven't tried this using a controller yet. When I do try it I will come back and update my review. I use a XBOX One Controller so as soon as I play it I will let you all know how it runs.\n\nI only had one issue with the game where I save and exited the game and then came back to play about 20 minutes later and it made me replay from the beginning. I tried it again the next morning because if I can't save my progress I wasn't going to replay it again for a third time from the beginning. The second time it saved. This may not have been an issue for everyone else, but it was an issue for me.\n\nJust in case you're hit with this issue I had making you restart from the beginning:\n* I had about 40 hearts when it accepted my save this time around.\n* There is also the chance that I started a new game and saved over my old one by mistake too, but since I'm not 100% sure, just thought I'd leave that tad bit of information.\n\nOverall, this game with a retro vibe is for all types of gamers who are looking for a casual game. If you need to take a break from a hardcore game you're playing this is a really good alternative to free your mind and is great for casual gamers as well.\n\nThe game is free but I would have gladly paid a few bucks for it as well.","January 10","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For the low low price of free, I'd say it's worth the time to play it. Very entertaining and amusing, and the fact that it lets you marry anyone you've healed in the end was nifty. A little more story to that ending would have been great, but for free I guess I can't really ask for more. Would have considered this worth it even for a buck or two, even.\n\nI didn't play the game on any setting above normal, but the way I got "101%" definitely increased the challenge, but going into detail on that is a bit of a spoiler. It's related to the "jealous chest." An optional challenge that I started a new game to complete as soon as I came across it. You can likely figure it out from there.\n\nI enjoyed the pixel graphics because I love retro ♥♥♥♥, but some of the graphics were a little hard to look at/some things looked like I might be able to interact with but I couldn't. The soundtrack wasn't anything special but it didn't irritate me in the least like some others have commented on.

Well, it's kind of hard tobe compared with such a succesful game, people may point many flaws, but guys remember this is a short indie game. The concept is pretty clear: you are a healer, so go around the kingdom, save people and save the princess. The "battle" machanics are pretty fun, just shoot, void, throw the flask if necessary and do not die. Sounds easy but it gets kind of hard, not much. The graphics are amazing for the ones who love retro games, because this isn't even pixalated, this is retro at its best.\n\nAs a conclusion, lots of potencial in this game.

This is a Retro-art bullet hell with a simple yet cool story: You're a princess who just graduated from healing magic school and you descend to a place called Hurtland and start to heal people, animals, mythological creatures and even Dark lords in a bullet hell combat style.\n\nPros:\n- It has a very nice difficult increase curve, neither too much neither too little;\n- Has 3 difficult settings And a joke difficulty if you hold the RIGHT arrow key during difficulty selection;\n- A nice variety of enemies, each one with its specific gimmick;\n- Has its fair share of secrets, the best stats possible to finish the game are 80 hearts, 6 power, 5 multi, 10 regen and 10 flasks, try getting them all, any difficulty.\n- You can marry anyone by the end, even an empty chest;\n- Charming soundtrack!\n\nCons:\n- Very short once you get used to it\n- Screenshots are buggy\n- Due to the limitations from the engine this was made on, there won't be achievements\n- Cards were planned but not implemented because it seems steam won't let they add cards to free games even though there are some free games floating around with card drops.","March 9","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's fast paced, fun, and free to boot.","January 11","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(I have a thing for anything with a retro vibe.) I am not disappointed at all with the game.\n\nAt first, the game does seem a bit repeatitive. Basically, you've been sent down to hurtland to heal people and objects, then you hve to save your friend. First, you're thinking okay this has been done a thousands times. You start playing and then you say this game is rather easy. As you keep playing the levels get harder. When I say the levels get harder; I mean you may find some frustration with the difficulty. If playing on Normal the hard levels are hard, I can only imagine playing those same levels on Hard and Master; would be insane.\n\nThe controls using the keyboard are pretty simple. Your traditonal arrows keys and your action button which is enter, shift, control and a few other keys that I can't remember because it's simpler to use the enter key.\n\nI haven't tried this using a controller yet. When I do try it I will come back and update my review. I use a XBOX One Controller so as soon as I play it I will let you all know how it runs.\n\nI only had one issue with the game where I save and exited the game and then came back to play about 20 minutes later and it made me replay from the beginning. I tried it again the next morning because if I can't save my progress I wasn't going to replay it again for a third time from the beginning. The second time it saved. This may not have been an issue for everyone else, but it was an issue for me.\n\nJust in case you're hit with this issue I had making you restart from the beginning:\n* I had about 40 hearts when it accepted my save this time around.\n* There is also the chance that I started a new game and saved over my old one by mistake too, but since I'm not 100% sure, just thought I'd leave that tad bit of information.\n\nOverall, this game with a retro vibe is for all types of gamers who are looking for a casual game. If you need to take a break from a hardcore game you're playing this is a really good alternative to free your mind and is great for casual gamers as well.\n\nThe game is free but I would have gladly paid a few bucks for it as well.","January 10","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The main difference between this and those other games is that your shots fire automatically and if you press the action button you fling a flask that has a blast radius and can either take out obstacles in fights or deal significant damage to enemies. The further you go, the more the enemies begin to fire shots like you're in a bullet hell shooter but it's not difficult to avoid enemy fire.\n\nThe only thing I could think of that would improve the game is if there were a strife button/option since you only move in the direction you press and it would make taking out enemies easier.\n\nThis game definitely deserves to be paid for instead of being free. I would gladly pay to own this game if I could.\n\nIt's short, it's sweet, it's free, definitely worth checking out, it's "Princess Remedy in a World of Hurt".","January 9","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The writing is consistently funny with that innocent, slightly absurd humor that I associate with 90's japanese games. It's also very polished and packed with secrets.\n\nOne thing I would like to see added is some kind of rating system at the end of each "fight", it would make the beginning of the game more interesting for people who like being challenged.

I got a huge nostalgia blast from playing this game. It reminded me of a few games I used to play when I was younger. The characters are interesting and cute, and I love that they each have their own little personality to them. First glances at this game may make you turn your head away, or just seem pessimistic about the game like I was. It wasn't until I started playing the game where I found it quite fun! The gameplay is mostly easy, with a few challenging moments mixed in. I loved the final boss. It was an interesting change to the other character's fights, but while keeping the same aspects of the regular fight.  I also love that the ending has a few different lines for every character. That made me want to travel back around the world to see all of the different endings. The music was quite entertaining as well! I do reccomend this game for anyone who's interested in short RPG games, or just something to pass the time. It's free too, which is a huge bonus! However, if you were to make a sequel to this game, I would suggest that you make it a paid game. I would've paid for this game if I had watched a few gameplay videos first. To anyone reading this, give it a try! You might like it. :)","January 21","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/swagsilicious/recommended/407900/","swagsilicious","Jack Swegolia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/swagsilicious/","51 products in account","What a wonderful game! For a game made in a game jam (and then edited some afterwards) this is much more in-depth than I expected! True, the game only takes around an hour to complete, but then there's higher difficulties and the multitude of endings possible (each one is only different by like two sentences but still) and plenty of secrets. I only beat it once at time of writing but I plan on trying the other diffitulties and getting 100%, as I only got 97%.\n\nThe gameplay is fairly simple: heal people. You talk to them to see their problem(s) and shoot at them with your healing abilities in a 2D shooter/bullet hell format. It's kind of weird due to the fact that you always shoot in the direction you're facing and you can't change it, but I think it adds to the difficulty. Speaking of, this game's difficulty is strangely up-and-down. For the first couple of areas I was breezing through them like a Nascar driver on speed, but suddenly I had to try some healing again and again because of how much the difficulty increased suddenly. Then a bit later, it became easy street again. Then hard. It's all over the place, but it's not bad since losses don't have penalties.\n\nThe story is simple: heal everybody, and heal the Prince! There's not much of a story, but there doesn't need to be. Older games that this is mimicing generally had about this much of a story, if not less, so it emulates it well. All of the characters you speak to have some really funny lines, and I feel like the comedy was done well. Whenever I think "that joke has kind of become slightly overused," the joke ends and another begins. That's key to good comedy.\n\nGet the game. It's 10mb, free, and fun. The only reason you wouldn't get this game is if you prefer story to gameplay or graphics to fun. I honestly feel like playing it for free was a steal, and I should have paid for this. Could there at least be a little DLC that's like $1 that includes artwork and a thank you note? I'd pay for it, even if it was more than $1. Would you believe me if I said it was made by (I think) 4 people! Crazy!\n\n(rant about how I like the graphics)\nI hear my friends sometimes complain about the graphics of older games with one phrase sticking out to me: "it looks like it was made in the 70s," (what someone actually said about Fallout 3). This game actually looks like it was made in the 70s, but that doesn't hinder the game at all. It probably gives it a cute charm. Well that and it's made to look cute, but ya know.","January 23","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A little more story to that ending would have been great, but for free I guess I can't really ask for more. Would have considered this worth it even for a buck or two, even.\n\nI didn't play the game on any setting above normal, but the way I got "101%" definitely increased the challenge, but going into detail on that is a bit of a spoiler. It's related to the "jealous chest." An optional challenge that I started a new game to complete as soon as I came across it. You can likely figure it out from there.\n\nI enjoyed the pixel graphics because I love retro ♥♥♥♥, but some of the graphics were a little hard to look at/some things looked like I might be able to interact with but I couldn't.
