This is arcade style racing game like Dirt 3, but with trucks.\nMultiplayer is dead so do not even count on this part of game. Just forget it like it never existed...\nYou will find only 6 trucks but you can customize them in many ways, also number of racingtracks is not bad because all of them have multiple variations with diffirent routes. For a player most important is fun - and for now I've found a lots of it - steering is very intuitive and implemented damage system is more than enough for game like this one.\nSeriously - last time I had fun like this when I played Dirt 3 for a first time. :-)\n7.5/10","May 28, 2014","true","4.9"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","12","15","0","0"

If you're looking for a fun arcade racer with trucks then this is the game for you. The game is a blast to play once you get the hang of the trucks. The physics in the game are actually quite good and the trucks handle nicely to boot. You can choose between 6 trucks in championship mode and all can be upgraded. You have 2 types of roads with dirt and asphalt with dirt having a slight loose feel to it but still feels the same as asphalt. You can upgrade the tracks for both dirt and asphalt but I just set one up for dirt and another for asphalt. For multiplayer I can't tell you how it is since its basicly dead. But for a pretty fun racing game, this is a blast.","April 28, 2015","true","11.0"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

It was on sale and I love racing games so I usually try most of them out.  It isn't a realistic racing game, it's more of an arcade style game.  There is a lot to keep you busy from the amount of races to the achievements.  My Xbox controller works really well for the game and I've had no issues with the controls.  Of course there are some flaws in the game but nothing major worth mentioning.  If you enjoy racing games you should pick this up when it goes on sale.","October 11, 2015","true","11.6"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Else it doesn't really worth this price.\n\nFirst: the handling. I wasn't expecting an arcade-style driving since the game looked realistic and didn't take a totally frenzy atmosphere. I mean, games like Flatout or Burnout are realistic-looking but you can easily tell they're focused on the fun part of destructing vehicules like "you can explode every cars in the crossroad/make you driver fly" and then don't expect any realism from the handling. Truck Racer goes "You're gonna race with trucks. Period.", and since there is not really that much of truck racing game lately, I was expecting stuff like Gran Turismo or at least Race Driver GRID with trucks.\nAnd even for an arcade handling it's really a weird one, like "you can drift but not steer into the skid but if you drift too much then your truck will spin", and also, the truck going full speed and taking some tight curve with no difficulty by the magic boost.\n\nSecondly: the difficulty. Let's face it: the game is way too easy. The bots let themselves being lapped by the first truck you can afford without any upgrades, then you become milionnaire after one tournament, and even if the devs desesperatly tried to harden the game by letting the biggest upgrades only avalaible if you have bought every other upgrades before, it doesn't make the game any harder, in fact, it makes the upgrade system completely annoying. There is also a damage bar but it goes down really slowly and I ♥♥♥♥ing tried to destroy my truck by smashing it on the contestants but every time I finished the race before my truck was totalled.\n\nAnd lastly: the content. So there is a bunch of tracks with their variations, all good, the tracks looks alike a bit but no big deal. The real problem here is that there is ONLY 6 ♥♥♥♥ING TRUCKS! ARE YOU KIDDING ME? THIS GAME WAS RELEASED IN 2013, NOT 1997! And all of thoses trucks actually looks the same with a little difference between every one of them. They're all arranged like this: the beginner's trucks (high handling and low speed), the asphalt one, the dirt one; the average trucks, the asphalt one, the dirt one, and the advanced trucks (high speed and low handling), the asphalt one, the... you got it?\nBut then it's make really little difference since you can beat the game with every one of them. And then the game is really flat and quickly boring after a couple of hours.\n\nA good point: not a single bug in sight. At least the game was finished at its release.","September 11, 2014","false","3.4"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

Get in a Big rig of steel, just like Euro Truck Sim, except now with 100% more racing!  Menus are easy to navigate, probably one of the best UI's made in a long time.  All the menus are awesome, they flow really easily, not much of a learning curve for people familiar with race games.  Best part is I havent noticed that rubber band AI stuff, where one accident spells doom as evry car races past you but no matter how good you do they are always catching up.  In fact they crash and all kinds of amusing stuff catching up.  The races arent too long, so its easy to play a round then go do something and then pick it up again later.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/elfshotthefood/recommended/256070/","elfshotthefood","ElfShotTheFood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/elfshotthefood/","1709 products in account","Truck Racer does exactly what its title suggests: There are trucks, and you race them. Generic title aside, Truck Racer is a fairly good arcade-oriented big rig racing game that is held back by a lack of difficulty and empty multiplayer lobbies. If you must buy it, wait for a sale.\n\nTruck Racer follows the standard racing game blueprint: you race transport trucks through a series of increasingly difficult tournaments, trying to earn enough credits to unlock the next tournament. Credits earned can be used to purchase new trucks and unlock better performance parts. There are six trucks to choose from and quite a few different parts to unlock, and it's fun mixing and matching components to get the best possible performance out of your vehicles.\n\nThe racing in Truck Racer is decent, with good course design and responsive controls. There's lots of banging and crashing as the trucks battle for position; expect to see lots of pileups and parts littering the tracks. Trucks can get damaged, but damage doesn't seem to affect handling. It's possible for trucks to take enough damage to render them useless, but don't expect it to happen even once over the course of the eight or so hours it takes to complete Truck Racer's career mode.\n\nSince it's an arcade-oriented racer, the physics in Truck Racer are a bit more relaxed. The trucks drift fairly easily, and crashes   that should flip the truck never will. This keeps the action moving along, although somewhat curiously Truck Racer doesn't have a "reset to track" feature, which means if your truck spins out and you're facing in the wrong direction, you'll have to slowly back up and get back on the track manually.\n\nTruck Racer's biggest problem is its level of difficulty. This is an easy racing game. You'll finish atop the podium in every race the first time you race it. Part of this is due to the game's AI: computer-controlled racers are kind of dumb, and they have real problems getting unstuck from accidents. While the other trucks are trying to get going again after a pileup, you'll leave them in the dust and the lack of rubber-banding means the other trucks will never catch up to you. Expect to win many races by more than 30 seconds. Even on Expert difficulty, Truck Racer is a breeze.\n\nLive competition would cancel out the bad AI in Truck Racer's single-player mode, but no one is playing this game online. This means Truck Racer has a short shelf life, unless you know some people who have the game and will play multiplayer.\n\nSteam achievements add some extra replay value, for people who are into that sort of thing. There are fifty in all, with most of them obtainable in career mode.\n\nTruck Racer is a decent racing game, with the added novelty of being one of the few titles out there that only feature trucks.   It's a good game to pick up in a sale.","May 10, 2014","true","9.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It was in a bundle with a bunch of rubbish games, and what sort of a name is Truck Racer? I was expecting a half-hearted truck simulator with awful physics, ugly graphics and bad controls. Luckily, I was very, very wrong.\n\nIf you haven't gathered from the other review, this game is an arcade racer. If you go in expecting a simulator, you'll be disappointed. The trucks seem heavy but agile, and the game's pace is relatively slow; there isn't a real feel of speed, but this acts in the game's advantage, as it is more about staying on the track and smashing your opponents than getting that perfect racing line and improving your PB lap times.\n\nThe models are nice with satisfying damage models, the sounds are basic but not awful, the graphical effects are good, if a bit distracting at times, and the menus & UI are beautiful. The trucks have a decent amount of upgrades, but little visual customisation. There are a number of trucks to choose from, but they are all one of two models, with slightly different bodykits. Paint colour can be customised, but that's about it.\n\nOverall, while it may not be the best arcade racer out there, you can tell that Truck Racer has had a lot of time and effort put into it, and I can easily recommend it for some mindless fun.","October 31, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has a really deep tunning and upgrade system which really has a big influence on your trucks performance. The tracks are all laid out well and grow more difficult as you progress through the championship mode, and the game offers around 6 hours of gameplay in that championship mode. All in all a really underrated gem.\n\nIf you want a more in-depth review\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STMAYVVbQxo","October 14, 2015","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not many others out there to compete with it since it is semi truck racing.  The game could be better though such as when you change from asphalt tires to dirt tires the 3D image of the tires on your truck does not change at all.  And it would be nice if there was an achievement for lapping other drivers during a race.  And when you do lap another driver, the game tells you how far that driver is behind you instead of the 2nd place driver (assuming your in 1st place).  Graphics could be a tad bit better as well.  Graphics are not bad but other racing games shine better in comparison.  But hey, what can you expect from a $4 game?  I'm just glad the devs didn't add missle launchers to the trucks (that's just not my style).  I do love the pieces flying off the trucks though when they smash into each other.  If you love racing games and you like trucks, well then stop reading reviews and add this game to your library.","December 24, 2015","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This becomes a major issue in harder races because the challenge comes not from better AI, but by having to dodge dead trucks as you overlap opponents on longer races; for harder races, the trucks just go faster without any other adjustments resulting in them knocking themselves or each other out.\n\nAs others have been stating, the game's achievements are not hard to obtain with the exception of the online achievements since no one is ever online.","February 1","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
