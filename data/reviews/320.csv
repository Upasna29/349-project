"http://steamcommunity.com/id/henky/recommended/320/","henky","[Bouncy] -|Henky‼|- [TTC]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/henky/","122 products in account","Are you seeing this because you are intrested to buy it on a sale? Don't even read further and get it right away for these few $ it is worth. Still curious? Let me explain why my hours for this game are so high.\n\nThis game has a very active modding scene who created a variety of different gamemodes. Unlike the name deathmatch tells you there is plenty of other things to do making it fun for everybody. The community is great and in many places very helpfull. They will sort out bugs you have or simply teach you how to play the game. You should definately buy this game! Expand the review to learn about its gamemodes.\n\n(Team) Deathmatch\nServers : Common\nSub Types : 1v1 , Matches , Bots , Variety of gravity's , KillBox\n\nAs the name of the game indicates this is the original gamemode of the game. There are many different kinds of maps. Killbox is mainly a box where you can hit about everyone with some stuff for you to mess with. Other maps can involve a variety of sceneries (Mappers like to use there own themes instead of just City 17). There is still an active competitive scene so if your up for 1v1 matches dig around and you can surely find them. Some servers often killbox like to turn the gravity down for some low gravity fun.\n\nThe gunplay is what i call "Unbalanced". This means that some guns are clearly superior over other guns and you will have to focus on getting better weapons from the moment you spawn (Quake style but not as extreme). If this is not your thing just continue reading because there are plenty of modes for you to find.\n\nThe most populair frag video from a well known clan : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtJgwl0EfgU\n\nCooperative\nServers : Common\nSub Types : Exclusive maps to some servers, Multiple gravities, Exclusive Weapons to some servers, Dual Coop\n\nThis is my personal favorite mode. Infact i like this mode so much i built an entire server[www.bouncyball.eu] around it.\n\nIn cooperative maps you work together with your team to destroy the aliens of the singleplayer game (Combines are broken). Additionaly some of the maps give you challenges similair to the physics puzzles in the original game or allow 2 teams to mix cooperative with the deathmatching (Both examples are rare as most maps are normal cooperative).\n\nHere is some uncut gameplay from my server to give an incidation of what the gamemode is like : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxjxStzUAv4\n\n\nPuzzle\nServers : Common\n\nThe name says it all. You are put in a map where you have to complete a set of puzzles in order to beat the map.\nThe puzzles you get a very varied and can involve anything from finding a path in a minefield , driving airboats along a track , building your way to the exit or hitting targets with a specified gun. Puzzle map creators are very creative in the challenges they think up so each map will have its own unique challenges to beat.\n\nPuzzle map gameplay : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUVN46I_TYw\n\n\nRoleplay\nServers : Common\n\nRoleplay is another fan favorite for many people of the game. It is cops and robbers style gameplay where you buy and sell your items and on alot of servers you can even buy and decorate your own house. Personally i did not play it much so my review would probabbly fall short of the possibility's in these servers.\n\nProbabbly not the best vid : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o54-ZKvVP8A\n\nSurf\nServers : Rare\nSub Types : With or without weapons (With is more common)\n\nSurf is something adopted from the counterstrike community. It all involves trying to surf down a track of slidey walls and not falling of the sides. On most maps depending on where you failed you get placed in a deathmatch box with a better weapon then those who failed before you.\n\nSurf Gameplay : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuexNobUAS0\n\nTrick Jumping\nServers : Medium Rare\n\nThese maps are similair to Surf in the way that you are trying to get from A to B. They mostly do not involve gunplay of any kind. Instead of sliding along walls you have to beat jumps of increasing difficulty. While fun on its own this is also often used to train for better movement in the deathmatches.\n\nHard Trickjump Gameplay : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEeuAHpI9l8\n\nZombiemod\nServers : Rare\nSub Types : Hybrd with zombie survival , Straight up killing\n\nWhile there are zombiemod servers they are not always around as these servers run different modes and the type of zombiemod also depends strongly on the server you play it on. Other servers usually have a bigger deathmatch focus and no npc's but since i only play it on mine i will tell you how it goes on our server.\n\nThe round starts with everyone as a survivor where you fight unlimited npc zombies in a set time. Once someone fails and greats beaten he will join the other team and only have a crowbar. Zombies are slower then survivors by default but are the only team that can use the spint ability. Survivors win by surviving long enough while zombies win by making sure all humans are dead.\n\nIn case you want to play it and no other servers are running zombiemod you can join our server bouncyball[bouncyball.eu] and vote for one of the zombiemod maps using !jb.\n\nDeathrun\nServers : Rare\n\nIn deathrun one team tries to run from A to B and the other sets off traps to stop them. There are a vareity of maps all with there own set of traps.\n\nGameplay from the most populair deathrun server : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYEpKmfEAz8\n\nScripting / Cheating / Building\nServers : Rare\nSub Types : Cheating , Building using server commands only\nWait what? Cheating? Hacking? o.O\nWhy would anyone want to do this?\n\nThe answer is simple. Using cheats and "Hacks" very cool stuff can be done in the engine. Do not expect these servers to be overrun with aimbotters (although some people will kill your godmode protection off). This is all about creating great things with the cheats in the game or your own custom addons.\n\nSadly all good videos of this have been removed but a quick summery of some stuff i saw : Giant Mechs (Working) , Space invaders remade , Dokuman attack , gm_flatgrass turned into a forest , Gigantic volcano jump challenge that will explode in a cool manner when beaten.\n\nThe possiblity's are HUGE!\n\nConclusion\nI probabbly missed alot of gamemodes as these are server experiments. Think about FreezeTag or extremely modified servers.\n\nThe server in this video has been remade entirely and most of the things shown are no longer there but it is a good indication of how crazy the game can get : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCmgRmg92Yo.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that as you can see in the above vid servers have a lot of control over the gameplay as they can program new features themselfs using the addon support for the game. Think about things such as statistics , jetpacks ropes and hooks , teleports , midget mode and many more.\n\nI hope my insiders view gave you a good insight in why this game is so well loved as the steam store page simply does not cut its job. The game has its drawbacks that in the past it has been ruined by valve quite a bit (And then fixed by valve and the community for the most part). Because valve does not look at this game very often the description and screenshots on the storepage are simply acient and you can experience some bugs and crashes. The more populair servers will do anything they can to provide a sollid gameplay experience so no worries.","February 6, 2014","true","525.2"," 111 of 112 people (99%) found this review helpful","99","111","112","0","22"

When i first joined and played there were\nmany and many fun servers to join some deathmatch, puzzles,coop, and TDM. I met the majority of my steam friends here... and enemies.\nThe noob i was helplessly getting killed over and over wanted me to just leave the game but something inside of me some power hidden\ntold me not to quit and keep playing and boy was it right!\n\n[Quick Game Summary as of 2016 Feb 5th]\n\nAs of now this game still has plenty of servers to join and are still much fun to play make sure you filter in the settings to Users playing in servers to have a better chance of finding Actual People in servers playing. The community of this game is very small now but everyone is nice, and helpful if you stick around long enough you will get to meet everyone , and become a regular  and make new friends. The type of game modes which are still around are Team-Deathmatch, Co-op, Puzzles,Deathrun, and Role-Play. HL2:DM still has much potential in it but the Developers just left it in the dust luckily we have very talented modders in the community who still make Beautiful maps, and amazing Pluggins for your enjoynment. For the Price of $5 this is a get right away game and play! You will need all Skills for this bad boy game no hacks,  practice on servers with bots and you will improve much more speed and accuracy for Deathmatch . Just like the good there is always the BAD you have to be careful when you play on specific servers, you will have the players and the Admins who will kick and ban for being better than them at the game. The game can be very fast paced or very slow paced for you campers depending which servers you join\nsome have the fast kill one shot and others have the stock settings which take a few bullets more to kill. I honestly would say i put a lot of hours into this game,  and heck? i dont think i will ever be done playing this so I urge you to buy this game and try it out for yourself It is truly a "Classic Jewl of a FPS game."","November 27, 2013","true","211.8"," 55 of 62 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","55","62","0","0"

Has Fps action + the ability to "sprint" with the games physics allows it to be a fast-er point and click shooter if not the fastest and the props/objects effecting it even more make it unique requiring good senses, reflex, smart reactions, coordination with just about everything to play at a decent potential. Where else can you Yoyo a grenade to keep it from 'cooking' it's fuse out before propelling it on it's last fuse reset that you can time for distance and height in coordination with how fast you are moving and your target's speed and the force of the 'gravity gun' you use to propel it with, no where else but hl2dm. Has different kinds of unique weapons like the gravity gun propelling a object to a person to kill them with, or propelling that object against another object to move that away from a distance. And to block a path with many objects or stack objects to reach a platform. Also the crossbow is an example of unique weapons with how it fires in a arch and hard to aim with even with it's scope but can kill a player instantly and with correct positioning can bounce of the floor walls ceiling terrian etc. and with enough practice can be well aimed to kill a player half the map away behind 2 corridors and a room. That is a taste of the Uniqueness of this game, after overlooking it's default multiplayer team vs team worth, there is it's booming in vast unique options to how to play the game with it's community's modded creations, there is co-op themed maps where you can fight with teammates against hordes of aliens, zombies, monsters and cyborgs getting points with the ability to use them to unlock server abilities to costumize your character with a deferent apearence, both in model skin and size, lights that glow on your model, lights that follow your model and more, then there is puzzle maps where you may enter 1 of 12 parts of the map at a time with your team or individualy and complete tasks like finding the exit in a labyrinth or placing and freezing a pile of crates to build a terrian leading to a exit floating high above in the sky or surfing on long slides without falling into abyss to reach a exit or jumping over ditches, climbing and avoiding obstacles in a temple like area to reach another exit to collect all exits and unlock the last portion of the map to complete it. Then there is Roleplay... a blend of multiplayer fps combat with gta style like the need to Purchase weapons or health or armor. Earning money by the minute with the wage given by your level or killing others for their pocket money, then saving that money to invest in a faster method of earning money like growing drugs to sell or printing money both to us on getting more guns or to purchase a home to hide in and to keep your drugs or printer safe, from other players or other players playing as Cops... who may not only steal your illegal possessions but will also place you in jail for some time so that they too may earn the points they need to progress faster and easier in that server. You may also invest in a home to hide from all players and keep your possessions safe, and to meet with your group of friends to prepare for a war against another gang, or to meet with your gang to prepare for a war against the police in alliance with other gangs for fun or for an event to earn more $. Also events are constant and include situations where a monster is spawned in the map similar to the any/many of the ones found in co-op maps that drop money on death. Another situation would be looking all over the map to find an object or player hiden with more $ $ $ that is given to the winner that finds it first. Or when admins just decide the server is full enough for a mass money drop in the middle of the map including weapons and item drops. There are also many more mods but I just thought to name a few of the ones that have me so adicted to this game. This game is worth the very low ticket price for all the fun is has to offer and is very much Alive, if not so is still rich with creativity you never know what's next.

I wouldn't call it empty, I say it has one foot in the grave. The community is in great shape for 2015, just like CS 1.6. There's still people playing, and there's also a lot of English people.\n\nAlso, this game is hard to master. People can kill you with radiators, tooth brushes, rubber ducks (yes) and other objects you can pick up with the gravity gun. Once you get it, you'll have lots of fun.\n\nAlso, DO NOT BUY IT HERE.

The things in between are countless, Roleplay, Fishing, Co-op and much much much more!\n\nBut as time passes games tend to die, and that is what is happening right now in this following game. It is pretty much unsupported anymore by community developers and ValvE in most cases.\n\nIt has a low number of players, quite limited I would say in each server. It is not your typical first person shooter, it is quite difficult to master and get used to in all ways there is.\nBlending in with a server's community might get you to enjoy it a bit for the first few weeks/months , but then you will realize that you have been playing with the same players over and over again with a few number of newcomers playing with you.\n\nSo if you would like a game to enjoy playing with people, feels alive, supported by community developers and the game developers themselves, play competitively and even create content for it (maps,skins...etc) this is NOT the game you would want to buy.","April 17, 2015","false","091.6"," 40 of 66 people (61%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","61","40","66","8","8"

Even though it's aged now, it still is a blast to play with friends. The Gravity Gun is what makes it so unique to many of the other shooters out there, even today in 2014. Similiar to Quake, it doesn't have a sprawling community to it any longer as Half-Life 2 is well beyond it's years now. If you get into matches you tend to get into an older community that is generally very friendly and results in some of the best games of Deathmatch, or other matchmaking playstyles. All it takes is about 5$ when Half-Life 2 goes on sale, if that even, so I'd recommend anybody who is into shooters to buy this game.

Using the Half Life 2 weapons, and bundling it up into a game is probably an amazing way to do Multiplayer, however I noticed that this game feels like it should be a gamemode in Garry's Mod, or just an add on to the original Half Life 2; not just a game by itself. Besides that, if you had the time of you're life killing the Combine with your weapons, esepcially the nototious crowbar, you'll have the time of your life killing other players.\n\nI'll give this an 8/10","June 3, 2014","true","9.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It's pretty fun, and you get it when you purchase EP1 so you can have a multiplayer experience.\n\nI don't get everyone calling this game empty; It feels somewhat empty, but theres about 20 servers to play on with real people and almost no bots. I wouldn't call it empty, I say it has one foot in the grave. The community is in great shape for 2015, just like CS 1.6. There's still people playing, and there's also a lot of English people.\n\nAlso, this game is hard to master. People can kill you with radiators, tooth brushes, rubber ducks (yes) and other objects you can pick up with the gravity gun. Once you get it, you'll have lots of fun.\n\nAlso, DO NOT BUY IT HERE.

I have not played it long enough to be 100% certain, but I would say there are at least 4-5 servers going at most times.

Sad to see Valve not really give a ♥♥♥♥ about it...\n\nAnyway, this game all-around is straight-up deathmatch.  Nothing weird, just kill-after-kill.  This time around, though, you've got them Source physics.  Drop a grenade at your feet, hit g, launch that grenade with the gravity gun.  Pick up a barrel or toilet and launch it at someone.  Watch someone try (and fail) to launch an explosive barrel, and spend so much time spamming "lololololol" that you get sniped.\n\nThanks, and have fun!\n\nAnd remember to check the comments for this review to see what happens when a "Professional CSGO Item Collector" sees a game focused around fun.  The result was hilarious-- a whiner who is absolutely disgusted by the concept of playing a game simply for fun, and challenges people to 1v1 them in CSGO to prove a point... right.

The maps are open ended and theres alot of room for all out battles in any part of the map. Taking from arena shooters like the previous game, items are scattered around the map some in great places to abuse the re-spawn, others not so much but you get by.\n\nThe majority of the games servers however are saddly empty. When getting a server list youll find that it will only get about 20 servers of wich 90% of them are empty. You will still find 2 - 3 servers with about 5 - 10 players at most, if youre lucky youll find a server with about more than 10 people. Said players also use voice chat and help out new  players but be warned that these people are the same players that have been on this game since the old days when the servers on this game were populted, so going against them will seem very tough.\n\nStill its a very nice deathmatch game, if you are a fan of the HL series and like deathmatch games this wouold be a nice addition to pick up. Keeping in mind the points that ive previously mentioned theres always the chance there are still players in quite a few number of servers.","August 14, 2014","true","12.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game doesn't have a big community and there are a lot of empty servers, but there will always be enough players to fill at least 9-10.

However, Most (Not all) of the community for this game is dead. If Valve kept up with this game by advertising it on the front page of steam, added achievements/trading cards, bot support, more maps that added objectives and game modes that would keep the game interesting, and, made the game free? it's community might revive itself. I wouldn't recommend this game currently due to its inactivity.","March 5, 2014","false","8.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Eldrun1/recommended/320/","Eldrun1","Eldrun","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Eldrun1/","46 products in account","Where to start? This is probally my favorite game of all time, not because of the amount of content in it, because if that was the case I would have moved to GMOD a long time ago. No, I love this game because of the community, you really get to become great friends with people in it, i've been friends with loads of people for years because of this game which makes it so much more unique to gmod because the communities are far less toxic or filled with squeakers that complaine about everything.\n\nNow with the game mechanics, this is pretty much like any other Quake arena based game, you speed around the map to get health, suit and better gun pickups, the guns are pretty balanced and to be a master at this game it takes not only a good aim and reaction time, it takes map awareness and bhoping, that's right bhoping is what makes you good at dm, not your aim. Another curveball in the game is definitly the unique "gravity gun" where you can pick up objects from a distance away weather that means guns in hard to reach area, extra hp in a pinch or even a prop such as a toilet to kill people with, it is truely a one of a kind weapon which takes a long time to learn how to use it to the fullest potiental.\n\nWith all the differnt ways to play a map, what weapons to go for first, if you should get that extra 45 suit over that magnum, or if you should bet it all on that rpg in the middle of the map, this game will surely leave you busy trying to master it, most likely taking years of practice if you are just now starting out to Quake arena styled games and HL2.\n\nNow, the real reason that keep me around here all this time (adding onto my first paragraph), is the roleplay servers of HL2. Especially sylesrp. It really is a great gamemode, not nearly as much as the gmod dark rp, but the huds are much more organized and the gameplay is simplisitic making it in my opinion a better version. The rules are more laid back and everyone in the communitys are useually a lot more chill about things such as getting killed and such. I've been with this specific server for about 6 years now, and I have to say it's really the only community I've ever felt a part of, not only are almost all the people nice, but most of them you see everyday, one of the most dedicated communites I've seen, some logging over 10k hours in the game, and most of it dedicated to roleplay.\n\nNow, even though this game is one of my favorites, I've had loads of fun, and I know a lot of others have, it just isn't worth buying anymore, the player pop is extreamly low and most of the communities are dead or dying, and the game should be empty from servers probally before next summer.","March 21, 2015","false","810.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Less can be more, and HL2:DM excels in what it tries to do.\n\nBefore TF2, there was HL2:DM for me, and 9 years later, it still feels great logging into a server, hearing the screams of all of those around me that endlessly kill one another, and try to survive in it all, so that just maybe I can make it on the top of the scoreboard by the end of the round.\n\nRating: 5 Thrown Toilets / 5","April 14, 2013","true","50.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/320/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Deathmatch part of Half-Life 2 was released separately around two weeks after release of Single-player portion. So yea, nowadays you will have to buy it separately.\n\nCommunity is small but living. Sometimes you will have over five or ten players in each of five servers or so. Sometimes it's just fourteen players filling up single server. It still is enough to have fun with basic stuff. Community has preference of playing either Deathmatch on some low-gravity killbox map or team Deathmatch on Runoff map, which is quite horrible.\n\nSo yes, you got Deathmatch. And you also got Team Deathmatch, which divides players between Combines and Rebels. The only difference is reskin of useless melee weapon.\n\nYou will also can find some people playing cooperative mod (usually invasion style thing) or roleplay ones.\n\nIt comes with few official maps, though most likely you will only get to see Runoff. Which is badly made, giving Combine side a rocket launcher right at the start, while making Rebels have to walk back to get more or less good weapons. It also has a looong dead end, which only has shotgun at the end, as if it's some kind of super weapon.\n\nIt's quite standard deathmatch game from older times. You got arena, you spawn in random spot or so, you have to collect pickups, there is no leveling. You don't usually survive encounters, so don't expect to be able to run away to get some health, it's kinda chaotic.\n\nBeing based on Half-Life 2, it brings physics into gameplay. Mostly it comes to ability to pick any object with gravi-gun and throw it at opponent. Another common tactic is using it to throw grenades that you put onto ground. It's not much of use otherwise, you can't get much of creative uses of gravi-gun in game where amount of kills is what counts. You may try to make ladders somewhere or try to block doorways with objects, but it's weak tactics.\n\nWeapon balance is where HL2: Deathmatch fails. There are two things that win the games: explosions and revolver.\nAny explosion has huge radius and would kill anybody immediately. And rocket launcher has rockets that are homing to the spot that you are pointing it, so players rarely escape whoever has rocket launcher. Those who don't have such weapons can just lob grenade onto floor, grab it with gravi-gun and then throw it as opponent, making sure that it will explode near player. Which requires timing. But still.\nWhen you don't get rocket launcher, you should go for revolver. It's a highly accurate hitscan weapon that requires only two shots to kill players, or even one if it's a headshot. Let's say, a skilled player can dominate both long-range and short-range as long as they know how to aim. After all, you can use Zoom, even though you have to release Zoom button before being able to fire. Nothing much that other players can do against that.\n\nOtherwise, you will use either crossbow or shotgun for short range. Yes, crossbow. Revolver is more effective at long range. So you just insta-kill people at very close range with bolts, as long as you can predict. Otherwise just do double-shot with shotgun. Yes, double-shot, alternative fire. Always do it.\n\nEverything else takes too long to kill and thus is quite useless.\n\nSo, what we got there, is a Deathmatch that feels tucked on the Half-Life 2, keeping weapon balance that was designed for single-player. It's not terribly balanced and fun. But I guess it should be amusing with bunch of friends, to fool around.","June 2, 2015","false","6.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

No.\n\nThis game is extremely fun in my opinion but it's dead. People have tried getting it popular but they have failed. If you're going to get hl2dm you mine as well not get in and get hl2 instead. hl2dm is dead period. It has less than a population of 200 and doesn't provide much content(since it's old) and isn't updated frequently because Valve doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥ about this game. I've seen a lot and Im thinking the game is going to die(as in 10 players tops everyday) somewhere next year or the year after that.\n\nThe game can be fun and all but the only I reason I would get this at this time is play RP servers and socialize. Other then that there is no point in playing this game.\n\nConclusion:\nNo, only if you want to play a good game that is populated + this is a multiplayer "accident" game.\n\nBut for RP? If you like RP then try it out and try a decent populated RP server.","October 12, 2014","false","839.0"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","41","7","17","0","0"

It was decided that the groom was “it” and he eventually found everyone but his new bride. Eventually the man became furious and decided it wasn’t funny anymore and left her there. As weeks went by he accepted that she’d had second thoughts and went on with her life so he did the same. A few years later a cleaning lady dusted off an old trunk in the attic of the building where the reception had taken place, out of curiosity she opened it. Inside the trunk was the rotted body of the missing bride who’d apparently became locked in the trunk she’d hid in. Whether she’d suffocated or starved was unknown, but her face was frozen in a scream and there were huge scratches in the inside of the trunk where she had tried to get back to the man she loved.","January 8, 2014","false","3.7"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","0"

With Half-Life 2 weapons and Half-Life 2 maps, how could it go wrong? That's probably the most fun deathmatch game I ever played, it has the Half-life 1 nostalgic feeling to its gameplay, and that's not even the best part, the best part obviously had to be the gravity gun, I mean, who would not like to play a online deathmatch game based off shooting toilets and sawblades right into your's opponent face?\nSadly I bet that if I start the it right now, it would only find around 10 servers or even less.
