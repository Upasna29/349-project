When I and a few others remarked on how unprofessional that was, we had our comments and posts deleted, as well as our names included in a very public "Hall of Shame" (which was also deleted a few days later) where the developers attempted to ridicule and humiliate us as "trolls".\n\nWhen almost no one posted any favourable user reviews on Metacritic, they asked Steam to remove their Metacritic score from the game's store page, as it gave them bad publicity (and that's why it's no longer here), but not before one of the developers (called Alexander "motorsep" Zubov) posted a fake review, giving his own game a 9 out of 10.\n\nCompanies that behave this way don't deserve any business.","February 10, 2014","false","1.2"," 204 of 225 people (91%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","91","204","225","9","3"

After bursting through the traps all guns blazing with its explosive scenery and intricate art style, the game quickly settles into a numbing monotony where the incessant rattle of gunfire begins to bore through your skull.\nApart from having to destroy anything in range, level objectives tend to have you moving backwards and forwards between two places, disabling force-fields and accessing new areas to take down specific installations.\nBut the one-note nature of the single-player quickly proves to be the game's undoing. One level blurs into the next and the repetition grinds you down. Additional weapons and new enemies help, but it's not enough to save a game that lacks a creative spark and the necessary variety to spur you on. Overall 4/10.","July 6, 2015","false","6.8"," 24 of 31 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","24","31","0","2"

Acceleration on your vehicle gives you a sluggish, floaty, imprecise feeling when you try to dodge bullets and stuff. Worst part about it is it gave me motion sickness because of how the camera is always moving based on where you are facing, but also because of the acceleration component of the turning and moving. The gameplay/level design is very old school and simple and consists of completing a certain number of objectives per map.

The 90 minutes I played some years ago wasn't impressive. And coming back to it today, the game is shockingly familiar. The single-player campaign is the same, no improvements or changes stuck out.\n\nUnfortunately, that campaign is pretty boring. I played a few more missions this time, but according to the only Steam guide on the game, I've seen almost every enemy except the final boss in just a few missions. The levels are bland, focused heavily on backtracking and trap sections. The AI is nothing impressive, even for 2011 standards, with most enemies being simple to fight. The only challenge of the game is the approach of traps and spawns. Even though these traps quickly become predictable, you can still be quickly overwhelmed as enemies spawn in all directions. Basic enemies can be threatening, and I've lost 100% of my health to a salvo of rockets I couldn't avoid. Due to this, the best approach is to exploit corners and weapons so enemies can't get a clear shot. Going toe-to-toe with hitscan enemies is a fight you can't win, so the strongest approach is to kill them blindly.\n\nPretty simply, the game is very underwhelming. It feels mediocre for a shooter, especially at the price point. Maybe multiplayer is better, but the community is not very active. Steel Storm doesn't really do anything special or noteworthy, and really isn't a game worth remembering.","July 18, 2015","false","4.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","1"

In terms of graphics, this game is average at best, the lighting is very low-key. I would say it is about the same as Zombie Driver in terms of graphics. The level design, although very nicely colored, is extremely repetitive. The layout is different yes, but the core mechanics of beating the map is the same. On the other hand, the weaponry in this game is fantastic, it’s a shame the devs implemented them completely wrong. Instead of making special weapons into an upgrade system, they made it based off of cool down. As a result, they immediately killed off any chance of re-playability for the game. On the bright side the enemy mechs are nicely done, they look fantastic and the bosses do offer much difficulty and requires mad kiting skills to kill. Overall an okay game to play with some friends for about 15 minutes before boredom kicks in.","September 24, 2011","false","4.1"," 17 of 29 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","17","29","0","0"

The game runs very smoothly on modern computers, I also tried it on a 6 year old mid level (back then) system and didn't encounter any issues there either.\n\nMain review:First off, I would highly recommend playing this game with a gamepad. It has a very nice feel to it, and after trying 1 minute each of standard controls and gamepad, I went with gampad and didn't look back.\n\nThis game is a top down shooter that actually plays a lot like old school FPS games like Doom and Quake, with the exception that you control a vehicle from above instead of a character from the first person view. Otherwise there are a lot of similarities: that is, you go around a level (mostly corridors/rooms), collecting weapons, shooting enemies, often looking for keys to unlock doors, and in the end getting to the exit, then loading the next level.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=502664236\nThe core game mechanics are actually really nice. I liked strafing around, using different weapons to take down the enemies. Different kinds of enemies require a few different tactics to handle in the best way.\n\nHowever, after a few levels, you have seen the most of the game, and it becomes repetitive. It's not so long that you feel that you have to grind through it, but it's the same thing over and over. A few levels try to mix it up by having a time limit, which can get frustrating, as I once got to the exit (after a 20 minute level) about a second late, and had to do it all again. I managed to get stuck twice as well due to poor level design. Once I had to restart, the other time I was stuck in an elevator shaft (the final elevator, leading to the exit) and could position the ship under the elevator to get crushed and restart the level.\n\nThere isn't any real sense of progress. The weapons you find and manage to survive a level with are available from the start in future levels, but that's about it. There's a score system, but the points are only for show.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=502664446\nThe story is presented through text boxes when starting a mission. Nothing that memorable, and at the end of the game I wasn't sure what I had accomplished. Mostly shot a lot of stuff!\n\nI think the game would have benefited from a deeper story with better presentation, and some sense of achievement/progress in between levels other than collecting weapons that you get to keep. Some kind of upgrade system would have been nice, and if it would have been deep enough it would be incentive to come back for more.\n\nWhen it comes to setting a score, this is a hard thing with the Steam recommended/not recommended system. For me this game straddles the line. If you got the game almost for free (in a bundle), I would recommend giving it a try. I wouldn't recommend it at full price, it would have to be a pretty large discount for it to be worth its price. So for me, it's still a "recommended", but with reservations.","August 19, 2015","true","7.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

It's fast and fun with a need for good reflexes.\n\nThe addition of a level and full map design tool is also a boon though there are only a few extra campigns out there.  Which do vary in quailty but also offer a good challenge for when you've finished the official campaign.\n\nIf you prefer a different challenge then you can also change the view to more like quake and games of that ilk.  This change of view angle makes the 360 field of attack much harder to cover.  Often the tactic you have used to survive in the more top down view will not save you here.\n\nThe visual effects and sound effects suit the game perfectly as does the music for the most part.  As with anything however music is down to personal taste and you can always turn it off and play your own if your hardware can handle it.\n\nI've played this on both aging AMD units and state of the art Intel gaming rigs and it played perfectly on all.  For those who have discovered issues there are work arounds which I've also used successfully on some rigs.  Find these on the forums.\n\nNow I'm not going to indicate that the game is perfect.  It does for sure have its flaws.  While it does have plenty of different weapons to sate most play styles the number of types of enemy is limited.\n\n1x Fast and light tank that can zap you and disable all but your starting loadout.  The handicap is temporary of course.\n1x Light tank that fires a single plama shot in each volley.\n1x Medium tank that fires 4 shots in a volley, as the class implies has more hit points than the light variant.\n2x Heavy tanks - one with a plasma turret and minigun turrets and the other with three rapid fire heavy plasma turrets.\n4x Types of fixed turrets, plasma, laser, missile, repair.\n2x big bads, a carrier and a super heavy tank.\n\nThe AI also has a few other problems that occur when there are player friendly or other players in a game.  Often the AI has problems locking on to a target and will constantly change target while never firing a shot.  On occation in multiplayer mobs will spawn and not attack making them easy pickings.   Thankfully a recent patch looks to have reduced these annoyances to virtually zero.\n\nAs for DLC, the extra weapons are a nice touch but too few.  The second DLC is a better addition with a whole new campaign with some new game twists which I'll not spoil if you've not tried it.\n\nOverall I found the game to be enjoyable if not a touch repetitive.  If you don't like shoot em' ups this game is not going to change your mind about them.  If you do then give this little overlooked gem a blast.","July 1, 2015","true","642.6"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","7","13","0","0"

It's just a fact. I've started trying to play the games for a bit to get some first impressions, and thus started my "First Impression Review" - just a quick look at the first hour/few hours of a game. If you're looking for something more in-depth, look elsewhere.\n\nIn short, this a 3D top-down shooter with maps - typically urban environments with grid-like streets - and objectives for each level/map. As far as arcade action goes, it is pretty entertaining. You have your infinte-fire machine gun, and then gain the ability to add other secondary weapons as you progress - such as rockets or a beam. Mission objectives vary from map-to-map/mission-to-mission - generally destroying certain targets (such as boss enemies or crates), clearing the stage of enemies, or simply reaching the exit. The latter generally requires deactiving force fields by roaming the streets looking for red lights to run over. There are items to find on the map to increase your score, and of course you're free to kill as many enemies as you like, even if that isn't the objective. You'll probably find yourself doing so anyway, given their aggressiveness.\n\nThe controls are pretty tight, and aiming feels very natural. I do wish the player's ship was a bit more agile, making it easier to dodge bullets. All in all, it seems like a good distraction, but more structured than other twin-stick shooters like Beat Hazard. I don't know how long it would take to wear out its welcome, but given the amount of weapon upgrades, and the ability to easily play in short 15-30 minute bursts, I'd give it at least 4-5 hours.\n\nI received this game as part of a bundle, and wouldn't recommend it at full price. However, my short time spent with it gave me a positive impression. It's hard to put a dollar-per-hour or dollar-per-unit of entertainment number on any game, as the first would be misleading, and the second... is very difficult to measure and describe.\n\nBased on the price I paid, I would recommend this game at $2.00 or less.","August 6, 2015","true","4.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It SHINES with polish and the excellence and bug-free experience ANY game can have with sufficient, dedicated development time constructively spent by active developers on working out the kinks, improving and optimizing the graphics, ramping up the coolness factor of the bullet streams, increasing the enemies' intelligence and their pathfinding and tactics, increasing the detail of the textures and improving the lighting and gameplay and...\n\n...well, Steel Storm: Burning Retribution (SSBR) has been through the equivalent of many "early access" development cycles without having used early access time.\n\nI believe I first downloaded it on Sourceforge long ago when it was available for Linux and Windows (however, my memory might be lying to me. If I were British, I might have the audacity (the word, not the software... see the connection I made to where Steel Storm: Burning Retribution might have started? Har.) to suggest that my memory might be telling me porkies.)  I learned that "telling porkies" phrase on a German<->English dictionary site[leo.org] and thought it sounded rather amusing at the time when playing it through various online text-to-speech engines.  But I digress. With digression, even.\n\nBack to the point: SSBR is a polished, satisfying game. You might find yourself spending more time playing SSBR than you anticipate.\n\nAnd that's just the single-player part. I haven't even delved into the multiplayer portion of the game with its collection of multiplayer variants (Edit: I have learned that the number of gamers playing SSBR in multiplayer mode is not as large as might be desired—for whatever reason—and more development time has been spent on making SSBR friendly to single players as a result). SSBR is like Unreal Tournament or Quake with modern graphics and mechs and hovertanks instead of humanoids. And limited, rather than infinite, respawns. And double kills, triple kills, quadruple kills, etc. And a LOT of weapons.\n\nThe View From Above Provides A Great Starting Point:\nSSBR is, by default, played while viewing your HoverTank from a top-down, third-person perspective. There's an automap in the corner and a larger toggleable map, but don't give up on it if that's not your cup of tea: the main camera can be positioned anywhere you want near your character (unless the camera options have been altered; I remember on an old build using a primary camera a little above and behind my vehicle with other buttons bound to cameras looking in forward/back/left/right/etc. directions from the POV of my vehicle. I remember lots of clipping errors in that build from many years ago, which was probably using a different engine.) When I played it today (the day I wrote the rough draft of this review, 2015-07-07), I noticed no clipping errors at all. Two camera options are available to choose as defaults, but individual features (e.g. speed of camera movement, camera response delay following your having turned or moved your vehicle, angle of camera relative to ground, angle relative to the vehicle, angle relative to a fixed base, etc.)) within those options can be changed, etc.\n\nI don't know if the multiple access-anytime camera angles are possible in the current build, but it would not surprise me. If you like games with lots of options to play with, SSBR can probably help to satisfy you.\n\nIf you like playing HoverTank DM/CTF/etc. or the much larger than I remember single-player tutorial and campaign(s), this game is different enough and contains enough similar and different features that it's an enjoyable experience.\n\nBy default, SSBR's controls are mapped to keyboard, joystick, X360pad, and mouse. The mappings can be changed at will from the main menu or the in-game pause menu.\n\nBlowing Stuff To Smithereens a Visceral Thrill; Finding Goodies After Smoke Clears:\nThe detailed and varying barrels and crates and bins and boxes and scenery are gloriously destructible. Unless it's a legitimate barrier (for which you will be grateful after you learn they can provide good cover from behind which to snipe turrets and other baddies), it can be destroyed... and what will the destruction leave in its wake? Repair parts to give you more health? An additional vehicle respawn ("life")? A new weapon? or a huge number of parts exploding all over the place, adding only to your score? The number of 'gibs' an exploding item releases can be set to preference.\nSSBR now has trading cards!\nMultiplayer can be co-op or competitive\nRuns on all Steam-supported OSs\nSSBR comes with an integrated editor, allowing the player to create new levels or campaigns","July 7, 2015","true","3.7"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Well, you might as well think of you craft as a floating tank. A tank that can pick up awesome weapons later in the game and the weapons are done very well and sharp. In a way think of the game play as Gauntlet. You rush through and you will get tore up dead fast, granted this game will ambush you even when you are careful. What can I say? I love the gameplay mechanics in this one and the nice sharp but not over the top graphics. Warning though, I do have a Quad core with a graphic card and this game will punish lesser systems. The game is simple enough in itself but it does eat processing power. I had this game on an older system before and it's a turn off when your game freezes half a second every 5 to ten seconds. The story in the game is completely forgettable, in fact I quit reading the text three missions into the game but the gameplay is it's saving grace. You didn't need a story for Pac-man did we? Then again I might be talking out of my age group. The down and simple is this is a great game. It has a weak point or two. One - simple design and Two - it feels incomplete but what is there is pure gold. Just make sure your system and run it smoothly and you should have some great relaxing fun. Awesome game?.. No, it didn't go for that but it's a great game just the same.","June 29, 2015","true","1.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The gameplay is great but in these days of so-called "AAA" titles people turn their nose up at the aesthetics. I think this is why metacritic gave it a low score. But in any case the game deserves some respect due to a few things that in a very noble move, it did not advertise as a feature.\n\nOne of these things is the fact that it uses netradiant and the darkplaces engine (themselves a fork of GtkRadiant and the Quake engine). Both of these are free software and licensed as such. The source code and what modifications were made to the editor and engine respectively are included on zip files with the distribution.\n\nTo my knowledge this is one of the few games on Steam that have free code and moreover ship that free code along with the install.

The visuals are nice and the controls are smooth. The weapon selection is good and provides some good ways of dealing with certain situations. For example,  the MIRV is useful for taking out enemies on the other sides of barriers.\n\nHowever, it's a little short, and the difficulty curve is all over the place.  I played on Arcade (easy mode) because I'm a casual babby. But every now and then, a really difficult level would pop up that would make me want to rage quit.\n\nThe final boss was rightfully difficult, but perhaps TOO difficult. The only way I managed to defeat it was to get it into a corner by a fence and then spam Beam Cannon through said fence. Beating it was satisfying, but it felt cheap at the same time.\n\nOne more thing I should mention is that I had a few technical problems with this game. I'm not sure if this exclusive to nVidia users, but I had to enter "sv_gameplayfix_nudgeoutofsolid 1" in the console to fix some major slowdown on a few levels, such as the second tutorial level. Otherwise, the game ran fine.","February 13, 2013","true","9.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Gameplay is actually quite smooth if you are running a decent system, and runs well on all three of the major OS players. Although you can change your POV, Top-down play is what this game is built around. Fast and agile, it gives a challenge, but doesn't hold you back from being quick and bold in your maneuvers. Varied weapons, and most peripherial scenery is breakable.

The game play reminds me alot of a modern day River Raid tied in with Alien Storm and it's ilk.  Quick to pick up, easy to play, difficult to master, the game has an interesting play style that is quite addicting.  The story line is rather lame and transparent but the game itself is well worth the $1.24 I paid for it on sale.  I actually will be purchasing the 4 pack to give away to friends!

Ammo is limitless, guns are plentiful and varied, and there is little story to speak of, aside from the short briefings at the beginning of each mission that tell you what to do, and sometimes, where to go, in the expansive levels.   The main gist of it is: infiltrate enemy bases and blow up everything.\n\nThe 3D effects are neat, but they can be jarring at times.  Sometimes enemies or even your own ship can get hidden behind a towering structure, but rotating the camera might reveal it.  In a game so dependent upon positioning and reflexes, managing this can get tiring.\n\nThe levels are varied and interesting.  You’ll explore frozen planets, underground mines, and sky fortresses.  Some of the levels can be quite easy to get lost in, and it is easy to miss an important switch or key and have to backtrack.  Taking the player out of the action for such a mundane reason is a big problem.  The map provided is not very helpful, as it is full of icons that mean nothing to you, and aren’t explained in the legend.\n\nYet I still had a good time with this game.  The cel-shaded graphics are cool to look at and the guns are satisfying to use.  The enemies can be overwhelming, but with smart tactics and judicious application of rockets and plasma beams, they all explode eventually.  The few boss fights in the main campaign are loads of fun.  Repairs and shields can be obtained from crates lying around the battlefield, but it can be a little annoying to have to break open three hundred or so per level to find the few that contain what you’re looking for.  A more consistent labeling or telegraphing what is inside would have been welcome.\n\nThis game is a great diversion for a few hours, an easy way to shoot bad guys and feel almost invincible, at least until they swarm you and remind you that you didn’t search enough crates for shields.\nThere is a DLC campaign called “Forgotten Prison” but I didn’t feel the need to play it.

The few boss fights in the main campaign are loads of fun.  Repairs and shields can be obtained from crates lying around the battlefield, but it can be a little annoying to have to break open three hundred or so per level to find the few that contain what you’re looking for.  A more consistent labeling or telegraphing what is inside would have been welcome.\n\nThis game is a great diversion for a few hours, an easy way to shoot bad guys and feel almost invincible, at least until they swarm you and remind you that you didn’t search enough crates for shields.\nThere is a DLC campaign called “Forgotten Prison” but I didn’t feel the need to play it.  Steel Storm: Burning Retribution is a fine game in its own right, though it isn’t without its flaws.","April 5","false","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I mean yes the controls and the gameplay feel good, but it's lacking in diversity and really any other point. The multiplayer might be bit more fun, but the servers are empty. (At this point I'm just running the game just to get the trading cards).\n\nI rate it 3 times shot in the back out of 10.","January 1","false","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Gamepad support is awful, I could only ever move in two directions with a controller.\nShort and sweet: The game is mediocre at best, and plain boring at worst. I do like the arcade-y feel of the game, but there are others out there that replicate that feel so much better.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAEFSECAcqE","May 21","false","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
