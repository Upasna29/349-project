Despite  just entering Early Access, it's already shaping up to be an enjoyable card game, setting aside the expected card balance issues this early in development. There are a variety of neat theatrics like card movement effects and attack rumbling that keep duels engaging.\n\nThe developer is also very receptive to feedback and constructive criticism through various available channels. It'll be interesting to see how this game continues to grow throughout Early Access - especially being the first card game on Steam that'll incorporate the Steam Inventory service for card trading and selling.\n\nOverall, definitely a game to hit the follow button on.","May 30","true","9.8"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"
