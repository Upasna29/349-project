I understand this is an old-fashioned genre, but I like flashy graphics and I want to have my cake and be able to eat it too!\n\nI am pretty pleased with this game overall.  I have an older laptop (still runs with Vista) and this game played very well, there may have been some lag with the bosses, I'm not entirely sure, it was ever-so-slight if it was lag.  And the game feels like a pretty solid shooter.  Lots of fire on screen, lots of moving targets to hit and avoid, powerups to collect all while the game gets increasingly faster and more difficult.\n\nThis is a more old-school type shooter difficulty-wise as it is fairly unforgiving with one-hit kills, no more than one shield able to be stored at a time and no mid-way save points, so if I don't beat the boss of a level, I start all the way back at square one for that level.  I do like that each wave is randomly generated, though, rather than just trying to remember a certain pattern to beat each wave every time.\n\nThe weapon system took a bit to get used to. Three different weapon types randomly appear throughout each wave, and the more of each specific weapon type I pick up, the stronger that weapon type becomes.  However, there is no way to choose between the different weapons, so every time I pick up a weapon I am not currently using, it switches to that specific weapon.  This makes for a game of go for the "good" weapon upgrades whilst trying to dodge the "bad" weapon upgrades (defined by personal preference) all while at the same time trying to collect the blue resource, dodge asteroids and enemy ship fire, and gain bonuses.  But at least there is unlimited fire with each weapon type, as I hate having to be stingy with my ammo.\n\nI really like the graphics though.   They are sharp and colorful and pleasing to look at.  Sometimes it's just nice to have a little eye-candy while destroying everything on screen.  The music is nice and fluid as well, and I enjoy the rock music that plays, signalling the boss fights.\n\nI'm also glad that this game comes with partial controller support (you still need your mouse for menu options) as I found it easier to play with the controller than with the keyboard and mouse.  It seemed like there was some slight drifting when I played with the keyboard, the controller felt more solid.  Although I would have liked a help page that told me what buttons did what.  I had an issue with pressing "Pause" instead of "Options" whilst in-game because, when paused, I could not go back to the main menu, but when I pressed optons, then I could.  Even though both of those buttons bring up the same options menu, when the game is paused, the "Main Menu" button is disabled for some reason.\n\nAll in all, I got this game to be a fun, old-school shooter with pleasing eye candy, and I got exactly what I was hoping for.","January 15","true","12.0"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","16","18","0","1"

There are a variety of power-ups to pick up in your quest, and various enemies will try and kill you and get in your way as you pick up things.  The game starts out pretty easy, but really starts to get tougher around World 3.\n\nThis is a shooter that has an old school feel despite the pretty 3D graphics.  The most important thing in a game like this is control, and happily your ship controls very well.  Movement felt natural and I quickly was able to figure out the weapon mechanic.  Your ship can only take one hit.  No life bars, just one hit.  You can pick up shields, and you get extra lives.... but every moment is very edge of your seat due to this mechanic.  The bosses are an interesting change of pace from the normal waves, but you need to figure out their pattern quickly due to how easy it is to die.\n\nAll that being said, I found time really got away from me playing this game, and before I knew it I was happily blasting my way through giant packs of green aliens.  The art is great.  The voice acting works, but doesn't stand out, and the music was fitting for the style.\n\nThe options are bare bones but functional.\n\nOverall I had a blast playing this game.  It is different from your normal shooter.  It reminds me more of Galaga than anything released in the last 10 years.  Very satisfying to blow up the enemies.\n\nIf you like shooters, especially "old school" shooters, this is one to try.\n8/10","January 15","true","8.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/424760/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Ladies and gentlemen allow me to inform you that Dragon’s Dogma: Dark Arisen was not the only interesting title released on my birthday (January 16) this year. Of course it received the majority of the headlines and the water cooler discussion – online as well as off in gaming circles – but Fair Weather Studios’ first entry on Steam is well and truly worthy of your consideration. Unfortunately, for the most part it has been completely and utterly ignored. It’s a real pity. The game does a lot of things right and the majority of those who have played and reviewed it on Steam have walked away leaving positive remarks on the game.\n\nBladestar is yet another SHMUP, or an arcade action shoot ’em up, to add to your library if you’re a fan of the genre. Those who love the genre know that the really good ones are easy to learn and quickly become difficult to master. That is absolutely true here. In fact, I may have never seen such an easy shooter to begin with making it ideal for those who are interested in the genre but have been scared away from the tough as nails titles.\n\nThe majority of good games in a genre also have a point of difference that separates them from other games within the genre. The point of difference in Bladestar is one that I have enormous appreciation of. Instead of having to gun down as many enemies as possible your sole job in successfully completing each wave is to collect as much plasma as possible. Failure to do so will doom your home planet. This is introduced to you very well in story mode as the opening levels are without enemy fighters but there are traps in the form of asteroids that need to be avoided.\n\nYou may feel that the $9.99 asking price is a little high for a first time indie developer. You may be right. However, there has been a lot of effort into the game and the quality of the game is at such a level that I feel that you would be getting your monies worth. However, if you were to wait for a discount or a bundle you’d be getting an absolute steal. There is still time, however, as of posting this spotlight for you to take advantage of the 25% off Lunar Sale pricing. If you’re a SHMUP fan you’d be crazy not to pick it up at this price.\n\nIf I could offer one point of advice to the developers it would be add those those in game achievements to the Steam Achievements feature on Steam. That way not only are going to attract the card hunters – kudos on that – but also the achievement hunters as well. In game achievements are nice but to actually have them on Steam means as much if not more.\n\nBladestar is a great little SHMUP that I would highly recommend to newbies and die hards of the genre alike. Easy to learn but difficult to master. With more play time I can see this becoming one of my favorite games in the genre and certainly my ‘go to’ for some time to come.\n\nFor similar reviews and our popular daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com\nJoin us on Steam at http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Steamified/","February 10","true","13.8"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/424760/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","I got the key from the developer to review the game.\n\nBladestar is a simple and to the point shoot 'em up and, while it does nothing to standout from the average, it manages to be competent in what it does -- with the exception of the very obfuscating backgrounds and poor choice of colors throughout. This makes it fall into the "No" category, but it may still appeal to fans of the genre.\n\nPresentation-wise, it tries to be a more modern, realistic looking game, against the many 8/16-bit games that most people are saturated with. Most of the models are nothing to write home about, once again being rather generic. The alien ships are the exception, which look pretty cool! Unfortunately, they're only present in the third stage of the game.\n\nIt has a nice lighting system, which surprised me when I saw my ship actually casting shadows onto other ships and responding to explosions and the like. The problem is that it only affects ships, which, let's be honest, is barely noticeable in a frantic shmup!\n\nA minor complaint I have is regarding the visual effects on power-ups: for explosions, shields, etc. the particle effects fit with the general theme -- when you pick power-ups, on the other hand, a few pixel-y particles are created, which seemed like a weird choice... not too important, but still something to be fixed.\n\nStill in the visual department, here's the game's biggest problem, to me: the backgrounds.\nFirst off, they're just a couple of static layers with parallax -- nowadays, something more could surely be done! The backgrounds simply loop, which is very obvious when you see the same huge planet scrolling for the fourth time.\nThe real problem, though, is how they always make bullets incredibly hard to see, and even to distinguish between different color-coded weapons and power-ups.\n\nEach level has a theme. For consistency, both the backgrounds and the enemies' colors are the same. While this makes some sense, it also throws visibility out the window!\nThe first level was okay. The others, however, were all a problem. The third level had green splashes on the background, which blended with the enemies' green bullets. The fourth level was in a debris field -- where most of the obstacles in the level were debris as well! I often got hit because I couldn't distinguish a real obstacle in front of the background...\nThe weapon pick-ups come in different translucent colors, making them blend with the backgrounds as well. This is a problem, as you'll often either pick-up a type of weapon you don't want, or pick up a weapon because you didn't even see it!\n\nIt was by far the biggest source of frustration I had with the game. Not being very appealing, visually, is fine with me, but when it obfuscates the screen in such a precise genre, it bothers me a lot! Hopefully, the devs can fix this! Tone things down a bit.\n\nThe music didn't really stand-out to me. It was simply background music, in no way connected with the game.\nThe sound effects were serviceable as well, nothing too wrong with it. The levels seemed a bit off, at times, with some explosions being much louder than the other effects (mostly the end wave explosions), but  nothing that bothered me too much.\nSeparate sliders for the music, voice and sound effects are always welcome, which the game had!\n\nControl-wise, the game is pretty good! I played with a controller, and it responds well to the analogs, actually behaving like one!\nThe menus are not controlled with a controller, but a couple of clicks and you're in the game anyway. Would be better if it existed, but hey...\nIt's very straightforward, you move and you shoot. That's about it. There's an auto-shoot button, which is good! For the most part, I had that on, but the later levels did require finer control!\n\nOnward to the actual game, now.\n\nYou control a ship that can only have one weapon at a time, out of 3 available. You can also have up to 2 drones at your side, each of them adding a bullet. There are 2 types of shields: one covering your whole ship, and small spheres that orbit around your ship. The former is destroyed when you're hit, while the latter can block bullets and stay strong, only being destroyed when it collides with an obstacle. All of these drop during the levels.\n\nTo beat a level, you don't actually need to destroy anything. There are little blue orbs that fall randomly that you need to collect X of to end each wave. Each level has 10 waves + a Boss fight. Needless to say, you actually do need to kill the bosses!\nThis little mechanic changes things a bit, but not enough to seem meaningful, in my opinion.\n\nWeapons have different levels. Whenever you pick up a weapon, its level is incremented, and they max out at 8-10, if I recall correctly. This is an interesting thing. If you focus too much on pick only one type of weapon, you may have problems later, if you pick up a lower level weapon! On the other hand, if you want to balance them all out, you have to play slower, waiting for the weapons to drop.\n\nThere are various types of enemies as well. Some shooting ships, asteroids, and mines. The mines I've found the most interesting, gameplay wise.\nWith asteroids and ships you know what to expect. Mines, on the other hand, come with 2 types: EMP and ... bullet-shooting mines, for lack of an elegant word.\nEMP mines destroy all of your ships if they're destroyed. The other mines explode into bullets, one in each of 8 directions.\nHigher level weapons not only do more damage, but also have a larger spread -- which refers back to my previous point of not wanting to shoot in later levels. Something, it's best to play safe, keep your shields up and dodge for a while! Moreover, it also gives you a reason not to have drones/orbiting shields. These will explode a mine when they hit. As you can imagine, they also make avoiding mines far more difficult, if you're in a tight spot.\nSo, once again, in later levels, I had to change my style significantly, by not picking up drones nor shields, for more maneuvering space!\n\nFrom what I've written, so far, you can certainly see the potential! It's simple, but it does have a few elements working together, leading to interesting strategic choices. Unfortunately, the visibility was a huge issue. For example, I often blew the bullet-mines up without even seeing them (leading to a chain-effect). You can see things going wrong fast.\nThat, with the levels being crowded (read: difficult), it was infuriating, at times!\n\n\nFinally, the progression and upgrade system.\nSomething I disliked quite a lot is how your power-ups/weapons always reset when you beat a level. I mean, if I beat the first level, I should be able to carry things onto the next one, right?\nThe upgrade system is also very, very lackluster (to the point of making me wonder if should even be there). When you beat a stage, you have 1 point to spend in: 1 (of 2) more lives; +1 level on one weapons when you start a level; +1 wave orb, etc.\nSeeing that in each level you'll collect probably around 10+ weapons, starting with +1 seems a bit... pointless?\nYou'll also have 4 or 5 points to spend, max. It's ... barely noticeable, unless you spend every point in one single weapon!\n\nThen, you also gain experience points. These can be spent on more lives (max of two), a "secret" level, and ship skins.\nWhy not have a more fleshed out upgrade system with which to spend experience? I don't understand.\n\nOf course, the levels would require a different kind of balance if the upgrade system was actually meaningful but... that's the point of upgrades, isn't it? Because, as is right now, you can experience the full range of your ship's abilities in the first level! After that, there's no "exploration" anymore, and it boils down to a precise grind to beat each level (which is valid, but, in this case, it seems like the two approaches are conflicted).\n\nThe game has potential, but there are conflicting design choices, and the visibility, once again, "killed" things for me.","January 22","false","6.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"
