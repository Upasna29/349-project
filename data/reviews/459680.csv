After all this time and thousands upon thousands of matches, I'm still playing it almost every day. At this point I can safely say that this is one of the BEST VIDEO GAMES EVER.\n\nWhile it may seem simple and like a typical "mobile game" at first sight, there is a LOT more to it. The emergent depth this game unfolds over time is quite incredible and puts at least 90% of all PC and console game releases to shame. Every piece, every single rule, in the game has been balanced and honed for years to make for one of the best examples we have of a well-designed gameplay system. Rest assured that you have never played a "dungeon crawler" like this before.\n\nThe laser-sharp focus on the core mechanism of "bumping" makes every monster and spell in the game work together beautifully. On top of that though, the "competitive single-player" metagame is nothing less than revolutionary in how it does away with pretty much every typical problem of match-based "highscore" single-player games.\n\nDo yourself a favor and buy this game! And in doing so, tell the world that good gameplay matters more than audiovisual pomp and exploitative business models.","April 13","true","16.2"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","20","22","2","0"

I have played hundreds of hours in beta versions for mobile and PC and I am constantly surprised by how close my matches are still.  There's a bit of a learning curve, but once it clicks and you're able to play faster, it's really hands down my favorite single-player game.","April 13","true","34.1"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

I know I'm in the minority here, but things that are truly novel just speak to my soul. Because of that, I tend to drift from game to game, playing everything in my library at least once or twice, but hardly ever come back to them once I "get it".\n\nAuro is not one of those drift-able games! I originally bought it on Android about a year ago, and have sunk hours and hours into it. This game offers true strategy, not the feigned depth of most strategy games out there. Most strategy games add tons and tons of complexity to their rule-set to keep the player from ever mastering the them. Auro keeps it super simple and elegant. After a hardcore year of trying to "get it" I keep being delighted with the emergence of strategies discovered through gameplay!\n\nSeriously, out of every game I've ever owned, Auro is the game that has kept my adult brain entertained the longest.\n\nDive in, bump some foes, give it a solid chance. You'll be glad you dropped a few bucks on a game that rivals the simplicity and elegance of the greats like Chess or Go.

The game never looked terrible, but the new coat of paint looks great and is definitely appreciated. The campaign mode, too, has been re-themed and reworked. The menus don't have the same graphical polish as the rest of the game, but for the Â£6 asking price I'm not too fussed.\n\nI should warn the people thinking of buying - this is a tactics game through and through. If you're looking for an immersive story or buckets of content you should go elsewhere. But if you enjoy strategy games like Advance Wars, Final Fantasy Tactics, Outwitters, or even Chess then you'll get a lot of value out of Auro. The game starts simple, but put in a little effort and it rapidly ramps up the number of pieces on the board and becomes pretty deep.\n\nI'll probably be putting as many hours into this as I did on the mobile version. I recommend it to anyone who likes tactics games.","April 13","true","1.1"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

We are introduced to him in this rogue-like strategy dungeon crawler from Dinofarm.\n\nIn typical arcade-style, the player is tasked with bumping various enemies off of a platform and into the obviously very polluted water to meet their demise. Falling into the murky depths (almost always) spells instant death for all who dare to take a quick dip. There are 14 enemy types and each type has a different method of forcing the young prince to walk the plank. Some enemies attack straight on, but can only attack with a few tiles of wiggle room, while some require special strategy to destroy. Learning the mechanisms of the bad guys is almost half of this game's incredibly steep learning curve. The other half is mastering the appropriate use of Auro's various magic spells.\n\nTo aid in the laborious task of reclaiming the hexagons for his own, Auro has magic on his side in the form of spells and single-use candies. The spells either effect the enemies themselves or the tiles at which they are cast and have attacks from ice-type to fire-type and everything in between. The candies can only be used once and a player can only carry two candies into each battle. The player learns new and better spells and is able to withstand more and more attacks, as the levels progressively get tougher.\n\nFor fans of the rogue-like genre, Auro can provide many, many hours of strategized bumping, with the ultimate goal of learning new and awesome tricks later on in the levels. For newbies to rogue-like games, Auro might be intimidatingly challenging. It is turn-based, strategy-heavy and has an intuitive difficulty level that gets more difficult as you get better, but some of the mechanics and combo moves might not be intuitive enough for casual gamers, even with the 31 stages that have to comprise the world's longest in-game tutorial ever.\n\nThe game's graphics and music are a throwback to the classic arcade era and for this type of game, works just fine. The focus of the game is obviously on usable mechanics and offensive strategy, not awe-inspiring graphics.\n\nIf you are already a fan of the genre, jump in and go crazy, but if you are considering this as your first roguelike, you might be happier with a different game.","June 4","true","4.0"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/459680/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","A friend of mine first introduced Auro: A Monster-Bumping Game to me a couple of years ago when it was going through beta for mobile devices. The gameplay immediately became addictive and very challenging. Although the game may appear at first to be a rather simplistic mobile port Iâve long hoped that the game would find a home in the Steam catalog because the gameâs depth is exactly what a lot of strategy fans have been seeking for.\n\nThe object of the game is to bump monsters off of the map and into the water. Doing so will award you points the amount of which is dependent upon the combo that you are currently riding. You need to score a certain amount of points each level to progress to the next. Players have spells at their disposal to aide their progress and learning the best use of these spells is arguably the most important aspect of the game. This will take time and experience proving that the game is difficult to master.\n\nThis may sound contradictory but the game is relatively simple to pick up once you understand the basics. But itâs learning the basics that may cause a relatively steep learning curve for beginners. Youâre going to want to watch the how to play video, which is below in the Steam description, to give yourself an understanding of the basics before you begin. Some of you who do watch the video will gain an early appreciation for just how deep the game can become.\n\nFrom a technical presentation perspective the music and the graphics are more than suitable for the game. Neither are overly flash or fantastic but they achieve what the developers hoped that they would.\n\nThe $8.99 asking price is quite reasonable for a strategy game of this nature. Itâs only a couple of dollars more than the iOS version of the game and considering that it was fully released last year onto the device you can understand why the game is slightly more expensive. The game on iOS has a 91% metacritic rating which is well deserved. This isnât just a game that has been ported cheaply onto Steam only to be forgotten about as the devs have given strong support to their game on all platforms. I would only ask that they add Steam achievements and trading cards so that the game can become fully Steamified.","May 2","true","1.4"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

This game is a marvel, the closest thing to an evergreen game that you will find. The new 2.0 version is a cut above the previous mobile versions in both art and gameplay, and I can't wait to spend some quality time with it.\n\nAt first, Auro may strike you as a bit weird: There aren't any experience points or tons of cool items or achievements. That's because the game is fun and interesting on the basis of its core interactions alone. It truly doesn't need all that cruft to capture and hold your attention.

Very few other games ask as much of your creativity and ingenuity and you feel truly rewarded when you pull a high point yielding sequence. Even after playing the game for months on iOS (and this version is much, MUCH more polished and refined), I find myself in new situations and I'm still discovering new gameplay interactions that are possible. The gameplay system is so novel, unique, and dynamic and I can't see myself getting tired of it any time soon. The artwork and music are excellent and charming to boot.\n\nWhile I have close to zero complaints in terms of gameplay, the content and presentation leave a bit to be desired. A practice mode where you could manipulate the terrain, experiment with all the spells, and learn how monsters behave would be a great stress-free learning tool. Currently, the only way to learn the game is within the ranked mode, and it can feel bad to be put into an unfavorable position or even lose because you didn't know what a monster or spell would do, and potentially rank down because of it.\n\nThe HUD, while visually pleasing, does not have enough feedback and doesn't take full advantage of the platform. Instead of clicking on the magnifying glass and then clicking on something else to learn about it, a simple right click would feel much more elegant and intuitive. Having certain elements, like spells and menu text for example, highlight when hovered over would make the game feel more responsive. Little things like that can go a long way.\n\nI'd love to see a PvP mode where players are given the same set of spells on the same random map generation and compete to reach the score goal in the fewest amount of moves. Similarly, I'd love for there to be replay functionality. Additions like this would be great in helping players be more aware of different possibilities in situations that they may otherwise not see.\n\nSome more content, like a couple more monsters and spells, could be nice, although I don't think they're at all necessary since the current selection offer an incredible amount of depth already that I'm still exploring.\n\nI truly hope that the game receives the publicity it deserves to incentivize the developers to add these and other upgrades to their already fantastic game. I strongly recommend Auro to anyone who has ever enjoyed playing a game.","April 22","true","8.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Its gameplay is very no-nonsense and thought provoking. Each spell is novel, yet ties back in to the core mechanism of bumping monsters off of the platforms into the water. The monsters are less interesting than the spells, but there is a great diversity to them and the different strategies that need to be employed to tackle each one.\n\nMatches are quick and there is no grinding. There is also a ranking system, that makes the game harder each time you win at it, and easier if you happen to lose at it. So the difficulty stays fresh, and sometimes new content is introduced when you beat a rank.\n\nA downside of the game in my view is that it is very difficult to binge-play, each session of Auro I can only get 5 or 6 games in, because even though I want to level up, the density of decisions quickly melts my mind and makes me crave the sweet relief of oblivion.\n\nAuro's art and music are both very good in my opinion, even though it's pixel art.

The concept is simple and the game is easy to get into, but everything feels fresh. Your goal is to bump monsters into the water, and to that end you use a handful of abilities and the terrain itself, occasionally also turning the monster AI on itself. All while ideally avoiding to be eaten.\nThis comes together really well, because the abilities, tiles and monsters are all designed with simplicity in mind but taken together present you with interesting problems to solve.\n\nThe animations are also very nice.\n\nThe port could be a lot better, though. I haven't played the mobile version, but there are just a lot of things that could have been better. For example, when you want to see information about a specific tile or monster, you first have to click on the magnifier button you'll see in the upper left when you look at the screenshots. Then you click on the tile. This has no place in a PC game, in this case this whole process could be avoided by just using a left-click for info/right-click to move or bump scheme.\nThere are also no zoom or scrolling functions as far as I can tell, which can be annoying, especially when you walk straight into a pack of monsters you couldn't see and really don't want to deal with right now.\n\nOverall I like this game a lot for its unique, challenging and addictive gameplay, but I hope some work is done on the PC version because the UI is a little clunky when it really doesn't need to be.","May 15","true","2.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I've never known people to be more willing to workshop with their fanbase and engage in a dialogue with their beta testers, taking their criticisms to heart. Every spell, every rule change, every monster in Auro has been revamped and shaped a million times by not only Dinofarm, but by a team of steadfast fans ready to provide feedback. The art has been done and redone and redone again to meet the highest quality standards, also standing up to scrutiny and critique of those in the community. Dinofarm loves its fans, respects them, and incorporates them into the game-making process.\n\nIn going about things in this manner, Dinofarm Games has created a masterpiece with gameplay that's unique, fun, and bulletproof, an aesthetic that is charming, beautiful, and nostalgic, and a business-model that is more genuine and legitimate than any other indie-developer I can conceive of.\n\nThere is love in every pixel of Auro and it shows.","April 15","true","0.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I was lucky enough to fall madly in love with the mobile version of this game (where I player well over 1,000 runs) prior to joining the dev-team, though, and can safely say that I would enjoy this game tremendously even if I wasn't one of the programmers behind it.\n\nAuro is a turn-based rogue-like that introduces two key innovations to the genre. The first is its ranking system, which generates levels for the player based on their persistent skill level. It cuts down dramatically on the stress you may experience in the first few hours of most rgue-likes, and helps make sure that you always have a fighting chance and that all of your runs will be exciting and dramatic.\n\nThe second key innovation is how you kill monsters. Instead of hitting them until their life-bar depletes, you simply "bump" monsters off of the board and into the water. This idea of bumping is at the heart of Auro, and just about every action you and your foes can take involves bumping in some form. This leads to characters consistently synergizing in surprising and delightful ways, like being bumped out of harm's way by a Slime, or setting up a charging Troggle to plow through your enemies.\n\nThey may seem like simple features, but they work together to create some of the deepest, most rewarding gameplay you're likely to find in a rogue-like. If you're a fan of either rogue-likes or strategy games, you should really do yourself a favor and pick this game up. I promise, you'll be glad you did.","April 15","true","39.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Essentially your goal is to push enemies off tiles into water while also trying to avoid damage or being pushed off yourself. You have a variety of abilities to help you accomplish this, and there's a fair bit of strategy once you learn how the enemies behave.\n\n- Very low resolution, and at this moment there isn't an option to go full screen\n- Lacks a story, I feel like this game would have benefited greatly from some sort of plot","April 24","true","0.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I did not design the game, so I am speaking as a fan first, dev second. I still play every single day. If I wasn't associated with the project, this would still be the case.\n\nAuro is just as replayable and continually rewarding as chess, tennis, tetris, go, etc. Take half an hour, learn the rules, and the game will reward you for years. I've played thousands of matches and I see no sign of that changing.\n\nI feel lucky to have been a part of such a special project.","April 17","true","15.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"
