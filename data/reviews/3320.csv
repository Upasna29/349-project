"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lovinglife139/recommended/3320/","lovinglife139","lovinglife139","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lovinglife139/","1123 products in account","Back before PopCap was bought by EA and the company saw the detriments that the very move brings, they made the most awesome "casual" games that somehow intrigued both casual and hardcore gamers alike. PopCap's major successes include Bejeweled, Peggle, and Plants Vs. Zombies, but through playing all of their games for the past twelve years, Insaniquarium is by far my personal favorite, and in my opinion, the most original, creative, and fun.\n\nThis game is part simulation, part "management", part tycoon, part action, and all sorts of...well, insanity. You are put in charge of an aquarium, where you can buy goldish, carnivorous fish, and many other types of creatures that you grow and make money off of. (First win of the game: goldfish poop money!) You use this money for upgrades (upgrade the food to make the fish grow faster and get hungry less often, buy carnivorous fish that poop diamonds but eat little goldfish, etc.). You have access to dozens of unlockable aquarium pets throughout the game that help you in various ways, and you choose which three you'd like to bring to any level. Oh, but I haven't mentioned the aliens. That's right, folks, aliens are so jealous of your awesometacular aquarium that they'll attack, and throughout the campaign the aliens get fiercer (and sometimes come in multiples!). Aliens will eat your fish, but not if you kill them first with a laser gun that you can also upgrade...with the money your fish poop, of course.\n\nNot only does this game have a great campaign that will keep you busy over the course of quite a few hours, but it also presents new challenges to the player along the way, in the forms of various alien types, different fish you have to figure out how to make profitable, etc. Not only that, but throughout playing you'll unlock sea shells that serve as currency for a "Pet Aquarium", where you can purchase fish (among other things) for a relaxing sim aquarium. These fish are essentially the same species from the game, but they come in a large variety of color combinations and sometimes even have special skills (some hilarious, some useful, etc.). What's even better? The selection of fish in the store is randomized and changed daily, meaning you'll come across some really awesome fish one day that you might not see for awhile again, so you can save your shells and get rarities or even just cool looking fish to add to you aquarium. You can collect quite a few, and you can even name them. You also have access to their "interests" screen, where you can learn more about your fish. Does Gill like to take walks in the park? How long have you owned little Floater? You can see all that and more.\n\nInsaniquarium is a perfect example of PopCap at their finest. Sure, the game is "casual", but it offers you so many options and it has so much detail that many developers wouldn't have added in (like telling you your fish's interests, for example). If you are a fan of PopCap's earlier work, buy this. If you are a fan of simulation or tycoon games, buy this. If you are looking for a game with a sense of humor to pass a few hours, buy this. This is PopCap's best effort, and will forever be a classic.","March 14, 2014","true","5.3"," 64 of 65 people (98%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","98","64","65","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/redrat9595/recommended/3320/","redrat9595","Red","http://steamcommunity.com/id/redrat9595/","216 products in account","Quite possibly the best game ever created.\n\nThe level of strategy required to play this game is nearly incomprehensible; I found myself having to have a piece of paper nearby just to draw out budget plans, and that's not even touching the complex combat system. When combat occurs, there's a sharp balance you have to hold between managing aggression and doing damage; less attacks per second to keep an important character safe, or more to finish him off but maybe propel the alien into your school? It's very difficult to the point that survival horror comes to mind as a genre.\n\nThe budgeting system is intense. Allocating funds between fish and weapons borders on art instead of strategy. Don't walk into this game expecting a casual experience. Without spoiling too much, I'll say that the upgrade mechanics are also amazing. While it's usually linear improvement, expect stellar new graphics and sounds along with your stat buffs. There are upgrades for fish, weapons, food, and more that I won't mention.\n\nThe soundtrack in this game is absolutely killer. Seriously. It's amazing. You could sleep to the calm tracks, but I can personally vouch that when PopCap wants to build suspense, they build it. They then deliver. Hard. The enemies you'll be fighting in this game are, as previously mentioned, no joke. Those linear upgrades I mentioned are less upgrades and more a scrabble to keep up with the standard of ten steps behind the enemy. Good luck accomplishing even that. And believe me. You'll be pounded with sick beats the whole time.\n\nThe cast in this game is great. Deep, dark, thoughtful lines and lovable characters, models, and animations make this game truly beautiful and unforgettable. Every death is truly a tragedy. The end credits are mostly comic relief (literally the first you'll see in the entire game), so they lack a bit in the way of factual information. Through my own research, I've found a few of the character actors:\n1. The dolphin's sounds were ripped directly from a Soviet nuclear submarine.\n2. One of the "hidden" special characters' grunts are from Sylvester Stallone's first role ever. I'm not sure they attained the proper licensing, but it looks like the beginnings of the lawsuit were swept under the rug.\n3. The guppies sound like a plethora of different actors, but is actually just Bill Murray pretending to be hundreds of other actors.\n4. The final boss is voiced by Bill Murray acting as himself.\n5. The last one I could figure out was the carnivores' bite sounds are the exact same sound as the dog bites in CoD: Ghosts. I'm not sure how that happened, but I promise that if you compare them they're exactly the same.\n\nThe last thing I'd like to touch on is the amazing graphical expertise that the art department at PopCap has. Genuinely soothing and peaceful graphics put you into a calm state right along with the soundtrack; that is, until and alien shows up and the advanced gore engine tosses guppy shreds all over your tank. The shading effects are also amazing. Shadows are affected by laser blasts and temporal warp shifts (TWSs as known ingame), and you can almost see the reflection in a guppy's eye as her beloved little sister is strewn halfway across the tank by the razor-sharp teeth of an extraterrestrial. When it needs to build suspense, it acknowledges the hardware shortcomings of the time and leaves a lot to the imagination; however, I promise you that when that suspense finally culminates, you'll wish they'd left a little more to be imagined.\n\nThis game definitely isn't for casuals or noobs. I'm not trying to be offensive, but I promise that it'll stomp you into the ground over and over, and its version of a reprieve is stepping back long enough to pull on a pair of steel-toes. The only tip I can give is to avoid indecision because I promise that if you falter for even a second, it'll destroy your guppies so fast that your economy will be irreparably tanked. And if you ever try to turn tail and run, you shouldn't be surprised to find some boot laces dangling from your nose. At least you can take comfort in the fact that the biggest inconvenience you gave the AI was having to dislodge its heel from your colon.","June 22, 2014","true","13.3"," 56 of 65 people (86%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","86","56","65","16","3"

Collect all the money and buy more fish! :)\n\nThere is a few different modes, Adventure where you have to complete an Egg by purchasing parts of it in thirds; in order to get the money you need to feed and grow your fish and use that money to invest in more fish to get more money quicker until you have enough to buy the egg parts. There is also enemies which will appear through a magical portal of some kind which will eat your fish - Don't worry though, your mouse is equipped with the finest lazer guns and can be upgraded for even more firepower.\n\nTime Trial mode is unlocked once each tank has been completed, and does exactly what the name implies. Get the most amount of money while being timed. The more money you get, the more "Shells" you'll earn. Shells is the ingame currency for the Virtual Tank.\n\nThe Virtual Tank is as it implies, a virtual fishtank. Purchase fish which you can name and feed every day.\n\nThere's also Challenge mode, but requires finishing Adventure mode in order to be unlocked.","June 23, 2015","true","13.5"," 33 of 33 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","33","33","2","2"

For a game that only uses the two mouse buttons as controls, I am strangely addicted.  Feed the fish, collect the coins, pause and wait for your eyes to stop burning, why is this so entertaining?  I honestly cannot put into words how I feel about this peculiar game; I am unsure whether to love or hate it.  Insaniquarium is undeniably a good pass-time, though why it's so easy to watch the hours fly by as you tend to your aquatic pets and fend off aliens is beyond me.  The concept of clicking repeatedly until your hand feels like it's decaying is typically not a good thing, though for this game there is an exception.  I can't give any examples to make somebody want to buy this game, as there is nothing note worthy about it.  Insaniquarium is simply entrancing for no reason whatsoever.","December 18, 2013","true","11.6"," 33 of 35 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","33","35","0","0"

The story grabs you in ways you've never been grabbed before. The thing that sets this game apart from all others is the beautiful way they combined the love and hate between the two main characters. The clashing love story between the two is absolutely amazing. In this game you must fight creatures of the unknown and do your best to salvage what you can of a dying relationship. If you're intersested in a story that makes you fight for love until you can fight no longer, i recommend this game for you. If you are not interested in the most beautiful love story ever written, i urge you to stray as far as you can from this game. As you play this game, you must ask yourself "Is all really fair in love and war?"","April 9, 2015","true","9.1"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

McDunnough","http://steamcommunity.com/id/calipanhead/","613 products in account","Before I start this review I have to say this game was my childhood.  I had an actual disc, a DISC.\n\nDon't be fooled by its "casualness",  this game is INTENSE.  Insaniquarium Deluxe is an aquarium simulator.  With a few twists.  Aliens attack your fish, fish can die if they turn green for longer than 10 seconds, and it has riduculous "buddies" that help you through each level.  The goal of the game is to buy fish and feed them so they give you coins.  With these coins you buy more fish, food, potions, and egg parts.  In order to beat the level you must buy 3 egg parts.  At random points during the game aliens will appear and try to kill your fish.  You have to click the aliens to kill them, ALOT.  RIP your mouse.  It also has a quirky and albeit immature sense of humor which when I played it my 10 year old self loved.  There is a buddie named "Preggo".  She is a fish that overtime gets bigger and eventually gives birth to a guppy complete with an absurd fart sound.  I played this game 6 years ago and it was a blast.  I just picked it up on Steam to find out it still is.  So, if you like quirky fast paced games pick it up.\n\nInsaniquarium Deluxe HD,  MAKE IT HAPPEN POPCAP!","March 19, 2014","true","1.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Then this is a the best game for you! It becomes really simple in the begging of the game with feeding the fish but then it transforms into something really crazy when you add aliens to the game and monsters to the tank, but don't worry you can always buy fish that can protect your tank of fish. Its a great casual game that anyone can play and learn. Its graphics and gameplay is very simple and fun to look at. The overall game is charming and adds alot of character to gaming.

It's odd that this is not under the horror/suspense tag because that is just what it is. Raising many, many, fish, only to have them taken away from you after a bond has been formed. I've named my fish individually, then was FORCED to feed them to another species of fish, only to have that species of fish savagely murdered by weird-♥♥♥, freaky-♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥♥-♥♥♥ alienfish. My heart could not possibly experience hardships any worse than it has for the hours I have clocked so far, and I only got this game yesterday. Many questions are left un-answered. Who are we? Why are we feeding the fish? Why are there predator aliens and monsters, that look like lions, invading this tank and eating my guppies? What the ♥♥♥♥, bro. Thos guppies be ma ♥♥♥♥♥s. You can't just walk (swim?) on up into my hood, and eat them like you own the place. ♥♥♥♥♥ you don't even pay rent, damn. There is too much nudity and suggestive content in this game for the general public. Let me tell you a little about one of the "pets" you aquire early on, named "Preggo". That's right. Her ♥♥♥♥ing name is Preggo. Just as her name suggests, she is an a-sexual-baby♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥-demorphed-rubberduck-thing. But you're probably thinking, "So what? It's the miracle of birth!". Well you're ♥♥♥♥ing WRONG. She literally ♥♥♥♥♥ them out. There's a sharting sound that plays every time one of these little ♥♥♥♥♥ are born. And believe me, they dont last long. That's right, your newest addition of the family is just food for these carnivorous fish, appropriately named "Carnivores". They pop out of her brown-star only to be eaten up by these scat-loving carnivores. So anyway, this game is NOT for anyone light-hearted or under the age of 18. Do I recommend this game? Of-♥♥♥♥ing-course. Much better than a game about some Plumber high on shrooms going around stomping on poor goomba family for a ♥♥♥♥♥ he never ♥♥♥♥ed, younowatimsaying?","February 21, 2014","true","3.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Bejeweled and Plants V Zombies is probably tied for second and then feeding frenzy 2 in third.\n\nReally though insaniquarium has got to be the best game that simulates a fish tank out there, heck its obviously not very realistic, but its got to be one of the most fun. If you haven't played insanequarium ever, you should try it, I bet you will like it.

Very interesting.\n\nBasic rules are simple: feed fish, and fight aliens. But this game has tons of ways to make this fun and addictive.\nThere are pets that you unlock as you progress. Every stage you can pick 3 pets to aid you in various ways, such as helping feeding, attacking, or providing information. A good combination requires quite some thought.\nAliens come in a lot of types, each with a different attack pattern. There are aliens that shoot missiles, aliens with two heads, aliens that can regain health, aliens that are killed by being fed, you name it. Fighting is intense, because you have to avoid having all your fish eaten.\nWhat I like most are food chains. In each of the 4 stages there's a different food chain. You start from cheap guppies, then earn enough money to buy a "shark"(I forgot its correct name) that feed on guppies. Fish at a higher level cost more, require food that cost more, and in return produce more money. Creating a healthy ecosystem in the tank feels GOOD.\n\n+ raise fish!\n+ create an ecosystem\n+ intense battle\n+ virtual tank\n- no flaw yet\n10 out of 10, masterpiece.","February 4, 2014","true","3.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Very interesting.\n\nBasic rules are simple: feed fish, and fight aliens. But this game has tons of ways to make this fun and addictive.\nThere are pets that you unlock as you progress. Every stage you can pick 3 pets to aid you in various ways, such as helping feeding, attacking, or providing information. A good combination requires quite some thought.\nAliens come in a lot of types, each with a different attack pattern. There are aliens that shoot missiles, aliens with two heads, aliens that can regain health, aliens that are killed by being fed, you name it. Fighting is intense, because you have to avoid having all your fish eaten.\nWhat I like most are food chains. In each of the 4 stages there's a different food chain. You start from cheap guppies, then earn enough money to buy a "shark"(I forgot its correct name) that feed on guppies. Fish at a higher level cost more, require food that cost more, and in return produce more money. Creating a healthy ecosystem in the tank feels GOOD.\n\n+ raise fish!\n+ create an ecosystem\n+ intense battle\n+ virtual tank\n- no flaw yet\n10 out of 10, masterpiece.","February 4, 2014","true","3.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Original, they can be based on anything else but they do their own way and with outstanding imagination. The right difficulty at the right time, to maintain the interest. Variated play modes. Ridiculous simple controls, usually just the mouse and their two buttons, some times the arrows pad is also neeced but, that's all. Very good music and sound effects....\nWell, if you already played Zuma, you know what I mean but, they have other interesting titles and this is one of them.\nHighly recommeded for casual tmes, when you are in a hurry and want to play just a bit or, for that "in between big games" time.","September 14, 2012","true","0.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

At its heart, Insaniquarium is a strategy game.  It just isn’t a very good one, despite its novel premise which has players managing an aquarium filled with creatures that literally poop gold.\n\nShould these riches be saved to buy an early exit from the level, or should they go towards the purchase of an additional fish?  Would it be worth it to research fancier lasers for fending off those pesky interdimensional invasions?  These are questions that players will likely ponder before realizing they don’t matter, since everyone gets to the goal line thanks to the title’s incredible ease.

However, it is a responsibility. Before getting a fish tank, here are some basic rules that you should know;\n\nA great starter fish is a Guppy, they are small, inexpensive and not too hard to care for.\n\nFlakes are a simple and effective diet for fish, and guppies live them! When feeding it to them, they will eventually grow.\n\nWhen guppies grow, they will begin to ♥♥♥♥ out nickels and dimes. When they reach thier maximum size, the dimes will turn into gold coins. This is natural for a fish, and can pay off bills.\n\nSoon, you can try a more advanced fish, a predator Oscar that eats young guppies. Because guppies turn a flake into pure gold, the Oscar manipulates this and turns the guppy itself into a diamond and poops it out. Again, quite natural, it's called reverse bankruptcy.\n\nHowever, sometimes advanced alien fish overlords will teleport into your tank, and eat every fish you loved. To combat them, you need a gun! I prefer a starter Glock 17, yet later they'll send in heavier alien overlords into your tank, even multiples at a time. Once this happens, you need to buy a sawed off shotgun from your local gun dealer. You have to be careful though, bullets can sometimes break the glass of your fish tank if not used correctly.\n\nYou can also use a kitchen knife to kill these 3" aliens and then throw them on the barby to feed your family and friends at a party. It sure will make an impressive entree.\n\nNow, guppies and Oscars aren't the only fish you can get. You can get a minature yellow finned penguin that can get pregnant by the water itself.\n\nFinally, if you want to upgrade your fish, you can feed them FDA (Fish Department Area) approved Asprin Fish Pills that are much better than flakes or pellets. You can also feed them Science Stuff in a jar to make fish ♥♥♥♥ out golden stars from Super Mario World.\n\nThank you for reading, may your fish tank prosper and not be overtaken by alien fish overlords.","January 1, 2015","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Be that as it may, the lot of clicking that you do is quite rewarding. The game goes in depth with unlockables, and different forms of items you are able to purchase. Being one of PopCapGames most sucessful games, Insaniquarium offers many great levels, game modes, and a variety of different fish you can choose from to raise. Some fish you can raise in your own Virtual Tank, that you need to check on from time to time to make sure they don't starve. Many of the fish available for purchase(in-game purchase) do a variety of unique things, making you all the more inclined to get more.\n\nAs you play the main Adventure Mode, you will discover many different species of pets, whether it be an angler fish, an electric eel, or even a deepwater lobster. These pets aid you in taking down enemies and feeding your fish to gain higher  funds in your wallet, and overall increase the flow of gameplay.\n\nPlease acknowledge that this game isn't for everybody. The vast amount of clicking and expanding the tank, could leave your hand tired overtime. The good thing about it, every click is rewarding in one way or another. I highly reccomend this game, as it is very addicting. You keep unlocking things, pushing you to keep going. 10/10","March 19, 2015","true","151.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This one heck of a real time strategy game disguised as a casual game involves keeping fish alive, having them poop money, managing your money, and fending off aliens so they don't eat or kill your fish. Or you can commit acts of cruelty by having the alien follow your fish (or better, bash it with a laser towards your fish) while they're following an angler fish, feeding a fish a star potion when it is too small, buying a guppycruncher without having any small guppies to eat, or other things. You decide! It is fun either way (but you will only progress through the former, not through acts of cruelty).\n\nYou play with the mouse, and depending on how you play, you will hurt your pointer finger or your mouse. Thankfully, there are features that ease this, such as other fish or creatures (e.g. carnivors or star catchers) you can buy that reduce the amount of bits of money to collect (diamonds as opposed to several gold coins, or pearls as opposed to beetles) or upgrades to your weapon... there are other features that you will find out yourself, but pay the money to save your finger... or your mouse.\n\nThis game looks dated and cartoony, but PopCap has made a masterpiece that is an insane mix of real time strategy, simulation, and shooter that picks at your trigger finger and your smarts. It has high replay value and you also get to have your very own virtual tank to keep (as opposed to the fish you have to defend against aliens). I was a kid when I first played this game online on MSNgames, and now I bought it on sale from the Steam store, and I don't regret my purchase. I think you will enjoy it too, and join in the insanity.","January 24","true","127.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I play it all the time mostly because of nostalgia's sake but it really is a unique and very well-created game. However, the game is a little short. The game can continue in modes like "Bouns Adventure", "Time Trial" and another mode that I can't quite remember. I am writing/wrote this post just minutes after I finished the game's main adventure for about the third time. This time, it only took me about 4.8 hours to complete. This should give you a rough idea of how short the game is. But don't get me wrong, I'll be back on playing it tomorrow in the other modes and I won't be able to stop. The game was made in 2006 so the graphics are'nt the greatest but I feel that it adds an alright feel to the game an it's easy to look past.\n\nPros: - Very unique\n- Little to no bugs or errors\n- Balanced\n- Zen mode to relax and customize your tank\n- Fun!\nCons: - Little to no customizations for screen resolution, size or graphics\n- Fairly small amount of original gameplay\n- No achievements (Neither Steam or In-Game)","January 1","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This one heck of a real time strategy game disguised as a casual game involves keeping fish alive, having them poop money, managing your money, and fending off aliens so they don't eat or kill your fish. Or you can commit acts of cruelty by having the alien follow your fish (or better, bash it with a laser towards your fish) while they're following an angler fish, feeding a fish a star potion when it is too small, buying a guppycruncher without having any small guppies to eat, or other things. You decide! It is fun either way (but you will only progress through the former, not through acts of cruelty).\n\nYou play with the mouse, and depending on how you play, you will hurt your pointer finger or your mouse. Thankfully, there are features that ease this, such as other fish or creatures (e.g. carnivors or star catchers) you can buy that reduce the amount of bits of money to collect (diamonds as opposed to several gold coins, or pearls as opposed to beetles) or upgrades to your weapon... there are other features that you will find out yourself, but pay the money to save your finger... or your mouse.\n\nThis game looks dated and cartoony, but PopCap has made a masterpiece that is an insane mix of real time strategy, simulation, and shooter that picks at your trigger finger and your smarts. It has high replay value and you also get to have your very own virtual tank to keep (as opposed to the fish you have to defend against aliens). I was a kid when I first played this game online on MSNgames, and now I bought it on sale from the Steam store, and I don't regret my purchase. I think you will enjoy it too, and join in the insanity.","January 24","true","127.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
