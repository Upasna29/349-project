Well the controls are terrible, but the game is alright.\n\nThe puzzles are interesting, but I feel like the hunting for the objects is much harder than the actual varied puzzles (none of which have taken me more than a few minutes), it's hard to build good depth when you only use a puzzle system once. The story is well executed, with forshadowded twists (so it's rewarding to be engaged with the story) with decently good voice acting. The controls are abysmal, even with an options menu for them, the mouse controls are completely bonkers, they *need* a "normal mouse" checkbox, and there are no convience features I often see in similar style games (auto save, arrow key navigation, some transitions (via doors) take too long, etc). The graphics are alright, some scenes look very nice, others merely ok, due to compression and the resolution I play at the video transitions look terrible (I also spoted one immersion breaking graphical glitch in the cafeterria).\n\nIf Myst style point and click games with a sci-fi story are your thing, this is an alright game for that genre, I enjoyed it because I love the genre, but it probably wouldn't pull in someone not specifically looking for the experience. Unfortunetly there is also a problem with the "price / quality / play time" ratios; there are probably better options out there for the price. So I recommended it to people who want to scratch that genre itch.","November 7, 2015","true","3.8"," 25 of 29 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","25","29","3","3"

How so? many thing one being the environment -youre on board some sort of ship.  Submarine or spaceship? you soon find out. There is no horror or jump scares not at all its a lovely adventure point and click game 360 degrees vision but not free walking. Its first person though. point your middle of screen cursor and if theres an arrow you click once and "you" walk a few steps automaticaaly. I actually prefer this freedom of movement because you dont have to inspect EVERY nook and cranny you pass by. Also it cuts down any motion sickness or dizzyness you may get to nil. well for me anyway. i love this game if you are a adventure "myst" gamer like me then you will enjoy this though not near as much as soma.","November 12, 2015","true","15.2"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","0"

Now that it is released in its entirety, I need to say this is an outstanding game, and I do recommend this game for those who are fans of point and click adventures, and a double -must have- if you love sci-fi/space ship environments.  There are some amazing surprise events along the way, and I found myself saving often, hoping for easy replay of those events that just have that-oh wow i want to see that again- factor. The extra saves have been super helpful as I am still back tracking trying to get all the achievements.  Some of the puzzles are really challenging (for me) so the best advice I have is don't give up!

It reminds me of a text adventure called 'Snowball'. That came out in the 80's.

Can have a cup of tea and cake, take my time and feel that I'm actually doing my brain some good.\nThese kind of games died sometime ago but with 'Julia among the stras' and 'Prominence' they seem to be coming back.\nOk, it's not everyone's genre but as far as I'm concerned it's well worth the dosh. The key to these type of games is simply don't give up and look everywhere carefully, floor, wall grills, cupboards etc. Ok, got that. good.\nThought I'd add that I play this on an i5 4670k 3.4GHz pc with an ATI R9 280X GPU 14.1 drivers, 16mb ram.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markzwaan/recommended/270230/","markzwaan","markzwaan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markzwaan/","2495 products in account","Liked this game a lot. It's easy to ruin a point and click adventure game (unfortunately), but this one pretty much nails it. Reminds me of what the best point and click games of the late nineties had to offer (think of the Myst series, 7th Guest, 11th Hour, Journeyman Project series etc.). It has good looking graphics, an interesting story that's slowly revealed, an intuitive interface and well integrated puzzles. None of those - I guess I'll just lock my safe with a sliding puzzle - type of puzzles. And also no puzzles that require some heavy lateral thinking in many, many complex steps (remember the puzzles from Day of the Tentacle or Monkey Island?). Some achievements can be tricky to get, but they are fun to find and there's plenty of hints in the forum. I've encountered no bugs, no glitches and no crashes, so the ones that have contributed to the negative reviews have aparantly been fixed. I'm also very glad they included the momentum slider. When I first started to play the game I felt seasick and had trouble clicking things until I turned the momentum WAY down. The only other negatives I can think of is the fact that the enhanced view mode you receive later on in the game has to be actived with the F2 key, which is all way on top of the keyboard. It would have been nice if it had been bound to either the space bar, the middle mouse button or if you could have turned this mode on and off from the inventory screen. Also the cursor changes to an upwards pointing arrow when you can climb up or down a ladder or something similar. It confused me several times having to click with an upwards pointing arrow in order to move down, but I got used to it in the end. Some of the screens could've done with a bit more animation, especially the one in the cockpit. But these are minor irritations which only serves to indicate that there is very little room for improvement. Bottom line: If you like scifi themed point and click adventure games, get this, you won't be disappointed. And even if you're not a fan of scifi themed games you might still enjoy it because it is well made.","January 4","true","12.2"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Plenty of puzzles to keep you interested, and plenty of exploring and discovery without endless trudging around picking up random objects. From the first 'who and where am I?' moments, you feel that there's a real progression as you learn more.\n\nThe story also leaves enough unsaid and unexplained that you feel part of a wider 'real' world, rather than endless explanations and tying up of every conceivable loose end. Very good story writing.\n\nOn the negative side, some of the controls are a bit awkward, including an apparent bug with some graphics cards for which the relevant point to click appears when you're facing in completely the wrong direction. (I fixed this on a Thinkpad T440s by forcing it to use its NVIDIA chip rather than the integrated Intel graphics.)\n\nMy one complaint is that there are multiple endings, but there's no real signal for you when you 'choose' this. It was only due to browsing the forums that I discovered that a seeming non-choice was actually a point where I could go in two very different directions. I suggest playing through, and if you can't work out how things could have ended differently then feel free to look up spoilers in the forum.\n\nOverall, a lovely game and well worth the money.","December 8, 2015","true","7.7"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

It pays homage to old school point and clicks, whilst keeping some fresh new ideas and a good mixture of different puzzle types in a rich and enjoyable environment, all round.\n\nI played on a new laptop with hybrid graphics, having an Intel HD 5500 on board plus dedicated Nvidia GeForce 940M. Without making any changes, it ran on the Intel, and I had the issues described, including some awful slow-downs on transitions that meant I had to stop and restart each time it happened - which was often. When I forced the game to run only on the Nvidia, none of the problems were apparent and it was noticibly much smoother, immersive and enjoyable, problem-free. Prominence has an engaging storyline, quality voice acting and good plot development.\n\nSo I think some compatibility issues there, but once overcome - if you can - it's a great game for the money, if a little short for me.\n\nRecommended for classic adventure fans.","November 9, 2015","true","11.6"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

The impressive three-dimensional environment and first-person POV made this a standout point and click mystery I had to try. The option to have motion transitions when walking to and from locations helped immerse me into the game even more. With a nice balance between background music and pure silence except for the hum of machinery, I felt settled in ready to tackle the mystery.\n\nAfter spending quite awhile in the first room of the game, I started to get the hang of the type of thought process I would need to use as I progressed and discovered new areas.  Some objects were harder than others to find and at times would cause me to go on a wild goose chase throughout the facility. Luckily, there aren't an overwhelming number of locations to explore and any given time. I'm also not one to think about crafting items from my inventory but that was another aspect of the game I had to keep in mind. I recommend having a pen and paper handy as jotting down specific pieces of information along the way will save you a few trips of back-tracking.\n\nIt was always rewarding to discover a new room or to get a new objective to complete. And For once it was actually interesting to read or listen to log files from the crew scattered throughout the facility. It provided emotional insight into the mystery of how things came to be the way they are today. The sound FX and voice acting are top notch for being an indie game. When you're that enveloped in the story and your mission, the game has a great cinematic feel to it.  I'm glad to have this apart of my library and would highly recommend it to fans of Sci-Fi and Mystery ... as long as you have a little (or healthy) amount of patience.","November 29, 2015","true","14.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

This game is especially commendable because of its attention to detail and the authors' expert writing.  By the end of the game you will know the map of the Laeril, details about the crew by name, and have a small inventory of tricks to solve the various puzzles with.  The story is plausible and original.\n\nI was frustrated by several hidden hotspots -- a regression from otherwise excellent, plot-integrated puzzles.  Once you are aware that you spent 10 minutes trying to figure something out, only to discover that you simply weren't aware you could open some container, you spend the rest of the game wondering if the same will be true about each new puzzle.\n\nThe interface felt old-fashioned at times.  The ability to look around in three dimensions, but only stand in one spot seemed awkward.  The transitions should probably just be turned off for all they add to the game, although several cutscenes were well-done, if short, including a glorious compilation of sun surface video (which I think were taken from real videos of Sol!).\n\nOverall, a strong recommendation, especially for science fiction fans.  Certainly not ground-breaking from an interace or graphics standpoint, but this is made up for by the care taken by the authors in crafting a narrative and world to take part in for a few hours.","January 31","true","5.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You try to the door to the hallway only to find that it is locked, and you have a bad feeling that something must have happened. In this sci-fi point and click adventure you will have to be on the look out for tools and items that will aid you in your mission to find out what is going on, who you are, and where everyone is.\n\nHere's the thing about Prominence, its got a good thriller of a story, something that keeps you guessing about who you are, and the fate of the entire crew as you find your way into more and more rooms. This game is going to give you serious fits of nostalgia for point and click adventure games as 90% of the time you are going to be using JUST the mouse to navigate, active, and use items in the game.\n\nNow that sounds like a good old experience, but for some reason the developers missed the mark. I think the issue might be that anyone who was playtesting this game was probably playing it since early on so some of the not so clear pieces of the game weren't an issue because they learned through repetition. My main issue is that nothing in this game is really clear, at all. The biggest issue from the olden days of Point and Clicks is that it was 2D so you had a finite space to look for things as you scroll from left to right, or up and down. This game is from the first person perspective and what you are looking for can be ANYWHERE in your range of view. The developer also did not make any of the items easily spotable, which is evident from the fact that it took 35 minutes of the game to find the first item I needed, and to be honest that mechanic, the finding of items and tools, doesn't get any better.\n\nI do understand that many of the point and clicks of today have some serious hand holding going on, but this game constantly felt like you had to find random items while blindfolded and only being able to feel around with 3 of your toes. There are some instances in the game where you want to slowly move your mouse over the entire object in order to be able to collect it, there are other instances where the item is so small or blends in really well, or is used in a manner that you have no idea why that works.\n\nThere's also the fact that during the brief, ineffective, tutorials that you will have no idea what is going on. Here's the prime example, with the right mouse button you are able to open your inventory, but at no time is it pointed out to you that there are tabs at the top of the screen, and what they will be used for. I spent a huge amount of time freaking out because of new functionality I've gained, but I had no idea how to gain access to the stuff I now had access to. I know I'm vague on this, but I don't want to give too much away, and if you play the game it will become apparently about what I'm talking about.\n\nAnother issue that I have with the game is the objectives, could you get any vaguer with some of them, I became so lost in this game that I had to result to watching someone's walkthrough of the game so that I could get back on track. There's also supposed to be multiple endings, but I'm going to warn you right now, the objectives will only lead to ONE of those.\n\nThe interesting thing about this game is that taking out the lack of being able to really play this game without feeling completely lost, or frustrated to the point that you want to throw something, this is a good game. I liked the story, I liked the setting, I liked the feel of uncertainty as I try to learn what happened, and what my character is capable, but at the end of the day, when a game has something that is really this big of an obstacle to play, this game will sadly have to go down as a miss. This game gets a 5.2 out of 10.","December 22, 2015","true","7.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The game itself was ok, moderately curiousity provoking and interesting.....however, the controls......oh let me tell you a tale of the controls.  For a game that lives and dies by the mouse, there is no excuse for what was experienced.  If I had obtained the game for free I would have not even bothered playing through....since I paid, I figured I'd be damned if a wonky control system would get me.  Well it nearly did.......the fun of the game was fully overshadowed by unacceptable and unexplainable mouse-pointer issues.  For example:  Click to go straight ahead (seems logical)...nope, in some settings you will walk around to the other side of the room facing in an opposite direction.....over and over you pray you can find the spot to click....only to be routed away from what you were just looking at.  Probably the worst was an experience with a voicelock door that couldn't be opened by clicking on the lock (having the correct voiceprint to hand)....until I realized the blank spot on the wall behind me to the left was where I had to click.......yeah real obvious.  This would have been a fun game, not too long, not too fussy.  Abysmal control issues rendered the game nearly unplayable ...hence the recommendation to not purchase the game UNTIL the control issues are resolved....","November 21, 2015","false","9.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Let me start with the positives.\nThe graphics are excellent, the music and feel are wonderful.\nHowever, all of that is meaningless because after 45 minutes I couldn't get out of the first room due to a completely broken user interface.  With Windows 8.1, when I click on something to the left, it activates something to the right (sometimes).  I saw an object I wanted to pick up, and it took me two minutes to actually get it in my inventory.  I saw the answer to the puzzle, but the user interface prevented me from accomplishing the goal.\nMovement had similar problems.  I click to move forward and end up moving a full 120 degrees in a different direction.\n\nI really want to play this game. Please fix the interface?\n","November 7, 2015","false","0.8"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","6","15","0","1"

Also, the audio of the characters was well acted out by every actor.\nGreat care was taken even in the trailer to make it very interesting and yet not give anything away.\nAlso plenty of Save Game slots - 10 pages, 10 slots each. I plan to have my wife play it and help her along the way, and there are many slots left for her to save to.\nI would like to see a sequel, this story is prime for one!\n\nI didn't have any dislikes.

It totally brought me back to my youth playing games like myst but this one is set in space! It couldn't be any more perfect. multiple endings, old school puzzle adventure style game play, decent puzzles, etc. The only downside is that it's not oculus rift compatible. I hope to see more titles like this one in VR in the future, because actually feeling like you're there would be the next level. I guess it could have done without the objectives to the left. you can ignore them, but I'd rather turn them off entirely. they take away from games like this one by making them too easy when the whole point is to be completely lost and on your own to figure it out. Regardless though, if you're a fan of games like Myst, you absolutely cannot miss the game. it's a real gem.","May 31","true","12.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
