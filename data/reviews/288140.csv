A user must register in order to view the Bug Reporting section of the Perfect Parallel forums. Here, try to find it, otherwise: http://www.perfectparallel.com/forum/26-perfect-golf-bug-reporting/\n\nInstead of taking bug reports seriously, the developers have religiously deleted legitimate forum posts, and fabricated TOS violations out of whole cloth... in an obvious attempt to muzzle legitimate criticisms.\n\nWhen a developer starts deleting on-topic forum posts, devoid of any rules violations, whatsoever... than, they have reached a new low.\n\nThe developer has now fully retaliated against these criticisms... by issuing a permanent forum ban; as of December, 19, 2015.\n\nOnly, that's not the good part. The good part; is that, the developer actually dredged up a forum post from May, 2015... as a pretext for a permanent forum ban, that has now been issued over 6 months later!\n\nSo, basically... Necroban. Here's the screenshot to prove the surreptitious hilarity. If you'll notice, there isn't even anything listed under the all important, "Ban Reason." http://s19.postimg.org/3tdzlgav7/2015_12_19_pg_forum_ban.png\n\nThe fact that, a game developer, would actually peruse back over 6 months into a user's post history, as a pretext, to ban them from the forums - and still not be able to come up with a legitimate reason - is both sad, and pathetic... on so many levels.\n\nForget about the game. One would reasonably expect more professional behavior from the developers.\n\nNevertheless, here are the rest of the issues with this game:\n\nThe controls are clunky; and according to the developers, the distances are intentionally obfuscated. – Have fun charting out distances for hours on end, just to figure out how far to hit the ball.\n\nThere exists no tutorial, despite the entire piece of software being anything but user-friendly.\n\nWhile there does exist an official practice facility, the user is not able to move around, nor follow any shot within said facility.\n\nThe sound is somewhat intermittent, with the impact of golf shots oftentimes being completely missed.\n\nThe graphics are not entirely terrible, if one is able to use their own imagination... with several obvious gaffes, relating to blending, or the lack thereof; as well as, poor water reflections, and nonexistent edge refraction.\n\nFor example, the outline of the rough - that separates different types of rough - often bulges, and causes shots hit there to bump squarely up against the outline of the rough, as if the golf ball were coming in contact with a street curb, as opposed to - thick grass.\n\nAnother example; is that the cart paths hover above the ground. The developer has stated this is intended, as it is apparently a workaround to another issue. – Okay.\n\nThe latest golfer avatar looks like he's been on the juice... with an over-buffed neck and shoulders, a hunched-over back, and huge biceps. But, the character also clearly has a broken back, broken wrists; and the new swing animation has a terrible hitch in it. – It's all just very amateurish in appearance.\n\nThere is no user customization, whatsoever. Each and every user is required to use the exact same character, and the exact same equipment. The only variation being, some horrendous shirt color adjustments. – Anyone interested in wearing an unbranded shirt, that looks like it's from 1985, over and over again? Wait, what... whose turn is it?\n\nThere have been ongoing issues with the game physics. – Kind of a big deal in a video golf game.\n\nThe developers have repeatedly made unproven claims about the accuracy of their physics engine, as it relates to actual Tour Golf... despite the actual in-game physics being routinely over-corrected, with each subsequent new draft version of this game.\n\nHitting three-quarter shots makes the ball roll forward excessively, moreso than would be realistically attainable with any given club.\n\nIn this game; shorter, more-lofted clubs, will oftentimes actually incur more roll-out, than longer, less-lofted clubs... when struck in the same exact manner. Go figure that one out.\n\nOr, shots struck with more power, right on the sweet spot, will oftentimes inexplicably lose distance... regardless of the trajectory of the shot. Clearly, someone did not apply themselves in Math class.\n\nThere have been ongoing issues with ball markers; not showing up, nor being in their correct location.\n\nThere have been ongoing issues with gimmes; freezing the game progression entirely... when hitting a par 3 tee shot that lands inside gimme range.\n\nThere have been ongoing issues with multiplayer connectivity failing.\n\nThere have been ongoing connection issues, which may cause undue stuttering while spectating shots.\n\nThere are ongoing issues with lag, and unexplained disconnections.\n\nSeriously... How long is "Early Access" supposed to work as an excuse, to keep releasing a first-draft version of a game that was actually released in early 2015?\n\nThe Course Creator has yet to be released. However, some testers have managed to create courses. The issue is that the system is entirely disorganized, causing users to have to download each course from varying download services, and manually extract each file individually into the correct game directory. There are no Auto-Updates in place, which also can cause users to have different versions of courses.\n\nThe lobby itself, is setup rather haphazardly, with things like; not enough letter characters showing, to indicate which hole a given user is on, despite the lobby itself supposedly having an indicator for that. Chat boxes oftentimes fail, rendering in-game communication inoperable.\n\nThere is no shot clock to dictate a fair pace of play, which is part of the official rules of golf. Since there is no simultaneous play option in this software... the lack of a shot clock becomes a big deal, as multiplayer stroke games tend to run quite long; or at least, much longer than they conceivably should.\n\nIt is not possible to convert a grouping to Custom difficulty settings. The difficulty settings chosen must fall under a default set. The alternative is to allow "Any" settings, which creates obvious mismatches.\n\nThe putter head is not at any time squared up at address. Not only that, but the putting itself seems to impart far more break than would realistically occur on similar greens, in real life.\n\nThe original putting meter has been replaced, along with the entire putting roll physics; while, users have been forced to learn another meter, several months after initial release. Then, the original putting meter was added back as an afterthought, solely on the entry-level of the game.\n\nThere have been bugs that have gone on for well over 100 days after being reported... and yet, the developers have had the audacity to claim that there aren't a plethora of new bugs with each one of these first-draft style updates.\n\nPerhaps, if the Bug Reporting section of the Perfect Parallel forums were actually made public, than the public could review the extent of issues with the game, on their own.\n\nBeing able to acknowledge and address mistakes does not mean a game is a failure. But, wild over-corrections, as have continuously taken place, in regards to this game... just doesn't pass the eye test.\n\nWhat's so hard about adding new options, without repeatedly tearing down the continuity of what long-standing users have grown to appreciate about the game? – Apparently, these developers don't have an answer.\n\n“Perfect Golf,” is like a less polished version of the Tiger Woods Golf series. A Poor Man's Tiger Woods Golf, if you will.\n\nIt originally showed some promise. But, as of yet, there are too many obvious bugs, ongoing... as well as, glaring physics anomalies; which would compel any sane individual to give it a rousing thumbs down.","June 18, 2015","false","993.1"," 82 of 109 people (75%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","75","82","109","11","3"

It was a fantastic game in the pre-release and the core gameplay still stands. However, as soon as the end product was released the name "Perfect Golf" was changed to "Jack Nicklaus Perfect Golf" and micro transactions were added. This seems to range from little things like shirts and pants for your character to golf courses. The prices for this adds up to $250 a year for a season pass?\n\nThis game was originally $19.99 before release and now stands at $34.99. I was thinking $20 was too much... this is abysmal. A game developer cannot simply add a $250 microtransactions to a game (PER YEAR?!?) and price the game as $34.99. This is unacceptable. Total cash grab. I cannot believe my eyes.\n\nIf this game were to get rid of it's microtransactions and put the price down to about $15 I would recommend it. However, as the current price stands, it is simply not worth the money.","May 4","false","8.7"," 89 of 121 people (74%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","74","89","121","5","6"

Water looks terrible, no 3d grass for light rough and rough, lighting is very basic and the performance is inconsistant from course to course. I have to turn settings down on an I7 4790k@4.6ghz and a amd Fury to maintain 60fps on some courses.\n\nGameplay - 7/10 RTS is broken, it is way too sensitive, move the mouse back 2 pixels and thats a full back swing at 800dpi* on a 1080p screen, only increasing the screen to 1440p and the mouse DPI down to 400 is the RTS some what controlable,this is using the lowest sensitivity setting in game....\n\nEven then there is no feel and putting is a joke, with the ball rocketing off the face after the smallest slowest movement you can possibly do with a mouse, to top this the game gives zero feedback whilst on the course has to what you are doing right or wrong, the only way to get feedback is to go to the practice area (no putting green btw), and you will get feedback through a launch monitor,  not that it will be any use to you as there is zero explination of what the numbers mean, so if you have never been on launch monitor in real life and had the number explained to you, you are screwed basically. This wasn't thought through at all and they listened to totally the wrong people when implementing this.\n\n*Mice used Roccat Kone XTD and Corsair Vengence M65\n\nHowever mouse swing using the meter isn't bad at all,  although it will be very difficult for the beginner. so max assists is recommended..\n\nPresention - 6/10 simple menus very easy to navigate....nothing to write home about\n\nValue - 5/10 Thought long and hard about this, if the game was £14.99 i would say yes the game is good value for what you get, but they have released it at £26.99...and on top of that have release an extra course as day one DLC (if you have DLC ready for day one, it should be in the game at no extra cost) and are planning more micro transactions.  So id say this game isn't good value, as of now there is no career or progression system, there is a planned course designer, but has yet to materialise (no idea what its going to be like)...there is online play, and solo rounds, for a golf enthusiast maybe just enough, but for a gamer looking for something to play, £26.99 is going to be poor value.\n\nOverall 5/10 This game offers nothing for the causual/gamer player, the learning curve is very steep, with zero understandable feedback from the game ( A launch monitor is jibberish to the none enthusiast Golfer, even to some Serious golfers), The gameplay is kind of there, you just have to put is stupid amounts of hours to find it, and you will have to go on the forums to find out what the numbers on launch monitor mean....\n\nI do like parts of this game, but i can not recommend it (not at £26.99), so its a thumbs down from me.\n\nEdit... I was banned from the forums for critizing thier micro transactions implementation in this game, the game is on its way to pay to win, with being able to buy balls and clubs that change the way the game plays.....Avoid this game and do not support this GREEDY developer.\n\nEdit... I just found out that this developer is going to make you pay for "major" updates to the game, disguising them as DLC....So this means if you want to keep your game upto date you are going to have to keep sheling out your hard earned cash to do so, and this is after they have the nerve to charge £26.99 for a half finished game.....\n\nEdit... This is a quote from the Dev reguarding the future of the game"Once additional Feature driven DLC is available access to play user created content will be limited to those players who are on the new version." This means courses you create yourself you will not be able to play anymore once the DLC update is released unless you buy it....This is disgusting from the dev its not enough that you have already paid for the game, they just want to fleece you out of more money.....\n\nDevs if you read this, its not the peoples who bought this games fault you underestemated how much this game would cost to develop and its not right to ask them to pay extra for updates, no matter how substantial the update is, The way good developers work is once you buy a licence for a game or piece of software it entitles you to updates for life, unless specifically stated...\n\nThis was not the case with this game, you waited until we had paid our money, and then unleased the news that we would have to pay money for "milestone" updates....Sorry but this is morally repugnant on your part, and you have shown that you are just going to milk this community for a long time to come...i really hope more people see through you.\n\nShame really because your game isn't bad, and if you had used directx11 from the start (oh one of things they want to charge for is porting the game to DX12)  and polished the game a little more before releasing it, the game would have sold well and you wouldn't have had to resort to such shaddy practices.","May 5","false","141.4"," 50 of 60 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","50","60","2","0"

Players who enjoy the game and would consider the season pass on the basis that they want the next twelve months worth of content (an annual basis) are left to make the decision to pump $200-ish into the game without any knowledge that they wont get any benefit from it.\n\nSteam users have become accustomed to purchasing season passes to their games that are detailed and communicated professionally to the point that that they know what they are going to receive for their money before purchase. They are not thrown into the deep end and face a high priced annual pass that they have little to no way of knowing what they are getting let alone whether the investment is the right one for them -- which it really isn't going to be for a significant percentage of your Steam player base. For those that do fit the bill, you're right, it is a bit of a bargain (ELI5 - other golfing simulation software that serves a very niche audience are generally priced in the vicinity of $1000+ and occasionally upwards of five times that so in effect the devs have made the market much more accessible).\n\nAlthough I have had positive communication with ONE member of your team the others that have contacted me along with your fanboys have been quite aggressive.

Also, I've been playing the best golf-sim till now, the RTS swing in Links 2003. I thought it would be impossible to better that. Other games, like Tiger Woods, WGT or The Golf Club have lot's of glitch 'n glossy of course, but they don't have that 1 definitive thing: a true golf swing. It's just not there. And that is what a lot of people have been waiting for: the true dynamics that go with immerging yourself in a virtual golfing environment. Swing plane, swing tempo, clubface angles, it's all there. And more. Much more.\n\nBut it's here now! For the very first time, we now have 'The Motion Swing' in Perfect Golf. A true masterpiece of computer engineering. After spending a couple of hours on the driving range in PG, I've started mastering this great simulation. Everything is there, albeit in embryonic phase, not polished and glitchy yet, but it's there! AND it works beautifully. For every golfer out there, real or otherwise, Perfect Golf is going to be your game, I garantee it.\n\nOnce you get past The Motion Swing (3-click is also on board for the diehards) you'll discover courses and other options to keep you happy for ever. Not right now of course, the game is being build as I write this, but in the coming months PG is going to become the new standard in simulation golf. One reason for this, is because it has a man on board who has been at the forefront of golfcourse design: Mr Mike Jones. A one time golfpro himself, he started dabbling in PC golf years ago, and ultimately became a major force is this departement. It helps if you KNOW what the game is all about.\n\nA sublime golf swing, real weather simulation, all kinds of gameplay, on- and offline, courses come to life with moving objects like trees, water etc, Perfect Golf is going to be everything golfing adepts have been waiting for.

Also, a multiplayer lobby and a multitude of game modes are great to see, but sadly no career mode or "pro mode" or anything like that.\n\nBut there also are endless strange bugs and interface weirdness, especially using a controller (which is the newest way to play, so hopefully that gets worked on more).\n\nThe main hangup is the old looking graphics.  The game has no grass, really basic looking water, trees with an odd sort of sheen look to them (something weird about how they look especially in the distance) and overall just appears to my gaming eyes like something you might have thought "looked great" in the early to mid 2000's.  Now I'm used to such a higher bar of quality in most every other game, genre and platform, that it is really hard to look at and enjoy for me.  It's all just flat textures draped all over for the most part.  Thumbs down on that for sure.\n\nI guess if you can get past the really old looking graphics, it's a great game of golf. But for me I can not do a "recommend" on it with graphics this behind the times.  Being on a golf course involves natural beauty and graphics quality is a main part of this type of games' appeal to me....and perfect golf lacks in this area big time.","May 8","false","515.4"," 22 of 32 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","22","32","0","11"

They need to fix the swing, either it is motion swing or power meter.

So the flood of recent reviews stem from that request.\n\nEven with the latest updates this game still has a long way too go. The RTS mouse swing isn't as good as PGA2k, TW series or CPG/WGC. It just has no feel, you have no idea what went wrong when the swing motion that just worked fine now sends your shot shanked off into the woods or a hazard. Ball physics are still unrealistic. This game is more frustrating to play than real golf a lot of the time.\nI would love to say yeah buy it. But if you do just know there is still a ways to go yet.\n\nRecommend this game? yes with a caveat. It is FAR from "Perfect" Golf. ball physics are terrible, putting is unrealistic, motion swing isn't real-time or tied to the golfer, wind has no effect, multiplayer has issues. Graphics are good (not as good as The Golf Club, better than World Golf Challenge 2011, the other 2 golf games I play).\n\nThe other caveat is to play this (and most new games) you'll need CPU and video card horsepower to run  it at high graphic settings.\n\nBasically this is Links 2003 updated to a 2009-ish game. If you like Links 2003 you'll really like PG. For those of us who like a golf game with a real-time mouse swing buy this early access release and see if the improvements over time make it better. $20 isn't a deal breaker. Right now I've stopped playing it and will try it again in a month or so to see if any improvements have been made.","January 27, 2015","false","128.4"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","1"

But as a game this has the effect of making the challenge nothing more than a hit-the-ding execise, it becomes donkey kong, a vastly sophisticated donkey kong.\n\nCamera always pans back to the player/ can't stay in reverse view whilst putting,\n\nApart from the 'too low' camera, the reverse putting view is the preferred view of many online golf gamers, to me it gives a lot more insight as to what the ball is doing in response to the profile of the green, yet as in real life you never take a shot from behind the hole! you may view it from there but never shoot it from there, all consistent with reality but the fun drain-out factor kicks in to turbo mode!!\n\nThe wheel spin elevates the camera in F5 but it all comes across as a little shunted and awkward, time consuming to get to the view you want, though the vast new numbers of courses offered online is a massive bonus - but completely nullyfied by what I see as the most advanced and realistic game of golf that has ever been created and also the most incredibly boring, meaningless and tedious too.\n\nThough I have gotten over my phobia ever to play the game again after my experiences of the PP forums which I said at the time and maintain it - contains some of the most unfortunate people I have ever run up against in my entire life, a whole community of utterly pathetic MEN trying to lull you in to bad words so they could tell teacher , 1.2.3 AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW he's gone and told teacher - even worse the game developers taking these peoples stance, puts them in the same bin! Silly old men thinking themselves advisors to the president was also a highlight of my experience there - USAF hero? nah how about silly old gerry, (where gerry scores 3 goals in a game of soccer) - did you see what I did there? good!\n\nThough I overcome that just by thinking - they work for me, all this is mine - as a hiking game in the countryside of course!\n\nAs a game it sucked, still sucks and always will suck - just because of the game architecture, it won't make a difference how many bugs and glitches you solve or how many new features no other golf game has - like the shot dominated effect, the architecture affect makes for a thousand different courses of 'pointlessness'.\n\nThx.","May 24","false","217.5"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","16","22","3","0"

I'm running the game in windowed mode 1280x768 on a 5 year old laptop with AA on and Bloom on. Trees are set at 350, shadows 200, Grass 100 and camera view distance 1500. All things considered the game runs good apart from a few stutters here and there that I can live with and haven't yet affected the playability.\n\nBall Physics: the team has done a wonderful job on the ball physics, especially after the latest update. I considered the ball physics in Links v1.07 to be one of the best I've seen in a golf game but in PG they've taken it to another level of realism. Sure, there is still some work to be done but having played a few different golf games this is the best I've experienced as yet .......\n\nBUT .... while I feel that tee to green the devs have created up to now the best simulation of real golf yet seen in a computer game, I do feel an element of realism is then lost with the putting model. To help explain this I should point out I am a novice real life golfer, having only played the game for around 18 months. So it is fresh in my mind what it is like to be a beginner and having to learn the game. I feel a simulation should have the same sort of difficulties and learning curve with all aids off as the real thing. That may also mean I'll never be able to shoot under par for a round as in real life. A par on a hole should feel like an achievement. Unfortunately the putting model destroys this sense of achievement because it feels like I have too much help. Sometimes I misjudge my long putts on a real course massively - and that never seems to happen to me in PG due to the putting meter. And sometimes in real life I've putted from the fairway just off the green and given too much power and ended up off the other side of the green. I can't seem to do that in PG as my power is limited by the meter.\n\nMy suggestion - a straight swing bar that follows the movement of the mouse. The putter head placed two thirds down the bar with movement then for back swing and power and length of follow through for movement. Putting aids can be markings on the bar to help judge distance but true simulation mode with no aids would be with no markings and just from feel as in real golf. Don't know if something like this is possible. It would mean that by selecting a putter the graphic would automatically switch from an arcing swing meter to a straight putting bar. In simulation mode full back swing (of course restricted to a point) and full, fast follow through would always result in a maximum power putt.\n\nA free roam mode would be nice, even if it was only restricted to a 20 or 30 yard zone around the golfers position, to allow for better planning of shots like in real golf when views are restricted. Of course, these restricted views should also be set to golfers eye level for realism.\n\nLook forward to future update improvements and hopefully more courses. Great job so far and the closest to a simulation of the game I've yet to play.","February 22, 2015","true","20.9"," 18 of 28 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","18","28","0","1"

Granted, the EA version has a few issues upon initial release but they are being caught by the new users and the Devs have a good list of things to work upon. That said, the game is beautifully playable offline and only limited today, by the online connections many games suffer from. It's best to begin offline anyway and play the game as it was made to be, a golf simulation. I wouldn't play a real golf course without learning how to hit a ball..!\n\nThe graphics on my 4yr old system run fine. I'd love to improve them, but to ensure the game runs with a good frame rate, I opted to keep the graphics down. However, the view is good, I have no tears or glitches and the screenshots I've taken look great. I can play the game at fullscreen in 1920 x 1080, so everything is as I expect.\n\nGameplay is almost spot on. It puts you in total control when playing using the 3 click system. The other control method is still being developed, so I'd expect that area to improve alot over the coming months. I won't comment any more on that, as I've not really tested it. This isn't like older or other golf games, it feels more Sim than Arcade. Granted it has a few elements that are needed to transfer anything simulated to a computer game, but they are minimal and necessary.\n\nReal Time Weather is pretty cool, and works a treat. The Time of Day setting is one of my favourite things, being able to visually see the sun rising or setting, and playing a twilight game has the good old feel of those summer evenings, with time on your side.\n\nCurrently the 5 courses are just about right. With the promise of many more to come, it will soon become a tough decision choosing what course to entangle yourself within. Plus of course the Course Forge (Designer) a little further down the road.\n\nI'd certainly like to see alot more improvements, walking the hole, first person perspective to name a basic few. However, reading the forums and discussions from the Dev's have made it clear these guys want to deliver something similar too. It feels like a winner to me.","January 24, 2015","true","367.0"," 27 of 45 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","27","45","2","0"

There is no AI, no season/career options, no stats, no tournament play. You can play a round against yourself or an online opponent and that's it! Graphics are average but it does however still require serious PC juice to run. Menus are few because there are no real features that require menus. Visually the menus have a very simplistic layout and are certainly not intuitive to navigate. There are no great new features in Perfect Golf that other golf games don't have. The features it does have are nothing new and are extremely basic with many bugs/issues.\n\nYou would think the developers would do something great with one of the most important areas of any golf game, the swing meter! Well, no, it's as basic as you can get!\nI like to click. You have some very basic difficulty settings you can adjust for the game difficulty and that's the end of the swing meter feature list. There is no option to change the swing meter speed to something of your liking. There is no option to add markers to the meter. The meter links to the graphics engine so if you don't have a silky smooth running game, you also won't have a silky smooth meter making it impossible to play. These are simple meter options golf games over a decade old provided. Perfect Golf gives you the most simplistic of meters with virtually no options to tailor it.\nIf you use the mouse method for swing, same deal, extremely basic with little to no control. There is not even a horizontal mouse swing option! There is no feedback on how well you did with your swing as in Tiger Woods games so you never know what area of your swing needs work.\n\nConsidering how little of a golf sim Perfect Golf provides, you would think the developers would nail what has been done before in golf games and improve upon those features. No such luck! Here we have first time developers and it shows in every bland detail of the game!\n\nOne final example to leave you with. The game contains a follow the ball in flight option same as a ball-cam from the Tiger Woods games. In Tiger Woods the camera follows the ball through flight and as it hits the ground the camera smoothly follows behind the ball as it bounces and comes to a stop. In Perfect Golf, as the ball hits the ground, the camera bounces along with the ball! The entire screen jumps up and down. Talk about annoying! Talk about motion sickness! Talk about the feeling you are playing arcade golf! You find youself expecting the golf ball to explode or some dude to come out from behind a tree and start shooting at you every time your shot hits the deck!\n\nIt's an early access game but it's not too difficult to see a game that no amount of time and patching will help ever become a good one. Complete waste of money and time!","March 11, 2015","false","3.0"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","12","20","0","0"

Things that seperates itself from other games:\n\n-A real time physics engine combined with real ball flight data(launch angles, spin rates and ball speeds) taken from launch monitors put this game in a class of it's own. Once you experience the before mentioned there really is no going back to other golf games.\n\n-The Motion Swing mouse mechanic is a first of it's kind that introduces D plane swing theory. What is D plane theory and how does it realate to the mouse? Well, the simplified answer is the tracking of the actual swing path plus the tracking of the clubface angle. Your swing path is determined by the direction you move the mouse and the clubface angle is determined by the tempo at which you move your mouse.\n\n-A real time weather and lighting system allow you to input a geographic location and play in those weather and lighting conditions. Never before has a golf game recreated weather and lighting conditions like this game. The lighting and shadow effects are exceptional and really change the look and feel of a course. You can even play in a thunder and lightning storm. Even though you wouldn't do this in real life it's worth doing in PG just to see the lightning effects.\n\n-The last thing worth mentioning, and maybe the most important is, this may be the first game to offer up realistic scores in competition. I see no way to shoot in the 50's on a consistent basis, especially with aids turned off. I see scores being very close to real life, maybe even higher. Since tempo plays such a high role in the swing, straight edging or trying to zero out the x axis on the mouse is not going to get your far. Also, since the game uses a real time physics engine to determine spin you can't put artificial spin on the ball and throw darts at every flag.\n\n$20 for this game is a steal. Buying it now will save you $10 to $15 when it goes retail. Once the course forge is released with the retail version and courses start pouring in, there will be no reason to even talk about another golf game. The potential this game has is limitless. If done right, this could be one of the greatest sports sims ever created.","March 2, 2015","true","447.8"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","11","19","2","0"

The lower I set the AI's abilities his shots just get better and better. With all ability settings on the lowest value ("1") he repeatedly drives within feet of the hole. With the greens settings at "easy" the undulation of the turf reminds one of the swells on the Bering Sea--with radical pitches and slopes. On some holes you might think you were playing mini-golf because the cup actually sits atop a mound. The AI makes improbable shots from the tee, from the fairways, and on the greens. To be fair the AI shots are sometimes what you would expect at a setting of "1"--but then there's those "wow" shots. Very inconsistent.\nAlso, there is no way to "save" your preferred settings from one session to the next. Each play time requires that you re-set everything to your preferences.\nAlso, some graphics are below "par" (pardon the pun). I cringe everytime I look at the deformed wrists of the avatars. It looks painful!\nOn the positive side, the scenery is very pleasant.\nI won't play this game for a month or so. Maybe there will be some significant improvements by then?\nI will recommend this game based on the chance that the short-comings may get fixed.\n\n--------------------------------\n\nUPDATE: PC games should be fun even if they are challenging. This game is NOT fun. It is NOT relaxing NOR can it be enjoyed! If you want FRUSTRATION then this is your game. Nothing has improved. The inconsistencies are the only constant. Hit a shot ahead of the "dead center" line and watch your ball slice wildly! Your best guess as to how to make your putt will never be correct. The "easiest" settings are NOT easy. If you want to be AGGRAVATED buy this game. Do NOT believe the PC Gaming review. If this game is still in development why are they charging $34.95!? I'm terrible at real golf and I have allergies that are exacerbated by grass on the fairways and greens; but still real golf is less frustrating and a lot more fun than this game.

Was fortunate enough to be involved in the beta testing of this game so I've seen it make progress by leaps and bounds over the last few months.

Get in on the ground floor for a reduced price and enjoy the ride before it's "official" release date a few months down the road. Without a doubt the closest representation of a "real" round of golf out there.

But if you are used to golf games like tigers woods, you will have a hard time adapting to this game. The physics engine is very hard to predict and it lacks alot of things that tiger woods games did very well.\n\nAll in all, I really do not think $20 is worth it. The game has a big learning curve, and maybe it is rewarding to learn it, but the game is just kinda boring. I understand it is an indie game and still is in its early stages. But even still, a 20 dollar price tag is a bit too much.\n\n5/10","January 28, 2015","false","0.2"," 15 of 28 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","15","28","0","0"

I waited to buy this game until user courses were added and until they decided to not charge a subscription fee to play it. I mean seriously, one day I will load up the game and the courses will be gone? I'll have to go buy an update for it to play what I have today? Sorry, but you are now not recommended by me. [End]\n\nIf you are a die hard video golf fan and have plenty of time to fiddle with settings and want to put in the time to learn the ins and outs, then this game can be fun. It still needs a lot of work, IMO, but shows plenty of promise.\n\nIf you are wondering about buying this game or The Golf Club game, the devs are very different in how they approach the game, PG seems to give everyone an option on how to play the game the way they want and TGC forces you to play their game their way with virtually no options. Both games are fun, neither game seems very polished for a 2016 next gen game.\n\nUpdate on Release - The game has now released, I think they released it too soon.... My feelings haven't changed on the game, I love it, but you need to be willing to put in the time to learn the settings with no tutorials. The game runs on the Unity Engine, same as TGC, both games need beefy pc's, study the specs before buying either game. Don't expect either game to be optimized more as I don't think Unity can really handle rendering full courses unless the users have the latest beefy gamer pc's.","February 19","false","170.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Unlike many early access titles, the devs at Perfect Golf aren't promising heaven and earth just to get people's money but they are promising to create a great golf sim for real golfers, something I firmly believe they are very capable of delivering.\n\nThe current basic build is solid and enjoyable enough to hint at what is to come. Of course it has some bugs and it is missing many features and some areas require polish but these are all being identified and dealt with systematically and professionally as far as I can tell.\n\nFor anyone looking to buy this game in its current form, note that it does not yet have the following features which some may want to wait for:\n\n- Computer opponents\n- Career mode\n- Golfer appearance customisation\n- Statistics and Tracking\n\nI would also say that, while the game looks very nice on my machine in ultra high detail at 1080p (you need a proper gaming graphics card here by the way), the golfer animation could be doing with being more fluid and the feeling more solid when the ball is struck or impacts the turf. It just feels a little floaty at this point with the golfer, terrain and ball all having a slightly disconnected feel. Additionally, the wind conditions seem to have no effect on the trees or flag; at 50mph the trees move identically to when the wind is at 10mph.\n\nOn the other hand, the in flight ball physics are awesome and the mouse control "motionswing" mechanic is brilliant and is easily the closest feel to a real golf swing that I've experienced in a PC golf game. This mechanism puts the onus on the tempo and rhythm of your swing rather than just how straight you can move the mouse back and through (anyone remember table edging?). Downswing too fast and the ball is going left, too slow and it's going right, similar to real golf. If you let the pressure get to you and you lose your tempo, you're in trouble, just like real golf.\n\nAlso, the real time weather and sky conditions make everything feel a lot more realistic and help with immersion.\n\nAt this point there are no computer opponents and no sort of career mode but these are planned. Additionally, there is no golfer or gear customisation beyond being able to select which 14 clubs you want in your bag.\n\nIf you are a new starter (or even if you're not), here are my top ten tips for bringing down your scoring and increasing your enjoyment of the game:\n\n1) go to options and change the camera to track your shot because it's a static camera by default which is boring\n2) bring up the map using the button on the top right of the screen to allow for easier aiming\n3) right clicking in the power circle allows you to change club and select normal or chip shot type\n4) right clicking again in the power circle allows you to alter the trajectory or add fade/draw bias\n5) read the instructions and practice with motionswing. It may be tough to start with but it's worth it when it clicks!\n6) The marker on the putting green has nothing to do with power, only direction. The centre point on the putting power bar is the power needed to reach the hole on a flat green. You need to go past this point if you want to putt uphill\n7) activate the terrain slope graphics for normal shots as well as putts because the ball being above or below the feet will send the ball left or right respectively\n8) wind seems to have smaller effects on the ball than in other golf games but once the speed goes above 20mph it starts to have more of an impact\n9) go into your golfer settings and swap something out for a 64deg wedge. This is easily the most useful club in the bag behind the driver and the putter\n10) if you want to chat in a multiplayer game, hit enter\n\nAs far as multiplayer goes, it is currently based on a peer to peer hosting system with the normal modes of play you would expect and a few unusual ones. Since there is no central server yet you need to ensure you have a fast and stable internet connection if you are going to host a game. Otherwise, ask someone with a better connection to be the host. My experiences have been mostly positive as both host and guest with no disconnections but perhaps I have been lucky with my opponents.\n\nFrom memory I think there are 6 courses currently to choose from and new ones are being added regularly as part of the updates.\n\nIf you are a fan of golf and you are looking for a proper golf simulator you should buy this game now.\n\nIf you enjoy golf games in general but want a career mode, customisable equipment and computer opponents, check back in 6-12 months.\n\nIf you want to pretend you are a superhuman who can drive the ball 400 yards and impart spin with the power of your mind, go play Tiger Woods.","February 16, 2015","true","84.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Don't expect an EA Tiger Woods console experience and you will be fine. A lot of work left to be done, but hopefully it will improve with each update. At it's purest it provides a great multiplayer experience, you won't find any reason to play alone except maybe to adjust your difficulty or swing format. When you make a great shot you really do feel the same satisfaction as you might with a real round of golf. I've tried motion controls and minimum assists but it felt too similar to my real life golf game. Much more fun and still challenging with the 3-click and help.

I can see the comparison but this game in its current incarnation isn't quite as good as that game. I have also played The Golf Club and that one I would say is the more polished game if I were to compare it to this one. The control scheme is also completely different, this game gives you the choice of swinging with your mouse or using a three click system which is my prefered method of control for this game. As others have stated there are a limited number of golf courses to play on at the moment but the game is still a work in progress so I'm sure that will change over time.

The release of EA finally arrived and I duly jumped and bought.  My initial reaction was one of regret because I couldn't achieve any level of gameplay.  Obviously my somewhat aged system was not up to the job.  Following advice posted around the forums I downgraded my graphic settings to minimum and suddenly I was playing the game.  My old eyes don't appreciate HD graphics so what I was seeing, looked fine to me.  What I'm trying to say is that I've needed to take the graphic demand to the minimum but am still finding a game I can play and learn.  Learning that there is little or no margin of error on the snap; the effect of moving the ball forward or backward in my stance; the influence of real time weather on the view of the game.  As an EA version of the game the potential seems massive and perhaps one day I may be able to afford a system to run it properly or perhaps I just need a new graphics card but in the meantime, I can still knock the ball into the water or the rough.","January 26, 2015","true","95.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

There are only a few concerns that i can bring up that they need to fix.\n1. Sometimes you can get your ball to bounce out of a bunker and as far as I know, bunkers aren't trampolines.\n2. Putting power and the power system. There is a a line that is what is the recommended strength for the the putt but it says you may have to adjust yourself based on the incline/decline of the putting green. This is false. If you go above the line on average putts it doesn't change the power at all. Same goes for if you go below the line. Chips and bunker shots have the same kind of wonky thing happening.\n3. Wind. Wind seems to have little to no effect on the ball's trajectory even at 17-19 mph.\n4. Your persons legs disappear when standing on an incline.\n5. The in game sound is insanely loud, even when  you put everything at 4% of the 100% possible. For me, 1% is about perfect.\n6. Ball spin. If you position the shot to where you get underneath the ball when you swing, backspin should accompany the shot as well as the shot going shorter than normal because it should increase the arc on the ball. No such thing happens. The ball goes farther and when it lands no backspin happens. Instead when you don't position it at all and just swing normally your ball will get this weird ghost backspin that happens for no reason. Topsin has a similar effect where the ball doesn't change trajectory at all other than it flys shorter than normal. No ball spin happens when it lands as well.\n\nIf they can touch up a few of these mechanics they have in the game but have no effect on it then this game will literally be perfect golf.

Well done to the team at Perfect Parallel! Listen to your users and implement what is practical and achievable and a magnificent game will result.\nI did enjoy comments from another reviewer regarding the "emergent physics" used. If this is the differentiator to other golf sims then with further gameplay and feature development this has the potential to be better than the Green Jacket wearer of golf games being Links Golf.\nWorks well on my 18 month old MAC. A little "choppy" at times but still adjusting graphics settings to find the sweet spot.\nI'm a keen golfer playing off 12 and much prefer the sim style of game, i.e. rounds of 65s - 80s and NOT the 50s you'd often see at the top of leaderboards on Links. Hopefully a blend of EA Tiger Woods (ease of play and visuals) and Links (gameplay and options) can be found.\nFinally regarding the Course Forge tool. Agreed this will be a welcome addition to enable continued course development although BUT without a "perfect" gameplay experience the product will be lacking.","January 24, 2015","true","70.6"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","7","13","0","0"

All I can say is the more I play it, the more I like it.  At first I was not impressed.  The up close texures of the grass and rough were so bad that I almost gave up on it.....but I didn't.  I kept playing and have really enjoyed how the game plays.  The overall look has grown on me, especially since I figured out that I can change the time of day using the "dynamic sky" feature.  When I changed the time of day to evening it really made a big difference to me.  All of the sudden, slight elevation changes were more noticable and the shadows cast gave everything a more lifelike feel.  Being a golfer, the ball flight physics seem very realistic, although some tweaks are needed in certain areas which is to be expected in early access.\n\nThis game is still in "rough draft" form but I can see the potential for a really great golf game.  I hope the Developers have the time and are driven to make the necessary changes during this early access period because this game has the potential to be great!","January 24, 2015","true","176.8"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","7","13","0","0"

Of course, I only expect them to get better as development continues, and as the community gets ahold of the CourseForge to create custom courses.\n\nAs would be expected, the Early Access version of this game has some issues with the swing meters. However, I still feel that this game has a good foundation to build on with the current meters. Looking forward to the later builds to see what each swing meter feels like.\n\nAlso, the simple, in-game match making and chat is decent for an Early Access title.\n\nCons:\nThere still seems to be a lot room for growth in this title. Most of the things I would say need to be fixed have already been touched on by other reviewers. However, I would have to differ in my opinion of the severity of the negative comments. I think that the main areas that will help improve the quality of this release are more player customization options, refined motion swing meter / character interaction, and more courses(...CourseForge).\n\nOverall, I am happy with the quality for such an early version of what has the potential to be an amazing golf game. Like I said, I am truly excited about the release of CourseForge, as I believe it will add a great deal of value to this release. I think that some people expect more from Early Access titles, and may be a little harsh on the developers.

What is amazing is this game is 'early access' and yet is still capivating to play, despite the rough edges which will, no doubt, be smoothed out as the game development progresses. Top impressions include: stunning procedural computer graphics (my machine is Apple iMac w/ i5 CPU) and the best golf physics engine I've seen on a game ever. Like real golf, Perfect Golf isn't easy. You won't be breaking par anytime soon, and perhaps ever if you turn off all the "aids" and tackle the courses at the hardest settings levels. I'm a former 3 handicapper and take my real golf seriously. There are no gizmos and fake PGA tour galleries...just great, accurate physics simulated golf. This is good virtual training for good real golfers and will help you hone your 'course management' skills. One last point, at some point users will be able to tap PerfectForge and design their own courses with a tool that is much more professional and capable than the Greg Norman Course Designer at The Golf Club game.","August 8, 2015","true","10.0"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","9","17","2","0"

It seems they cater to the motion swingers style as they create anti cheat software for the 3 click meter, but install sensitivity adjusters for the motion swing. MS is far too easy to manipulate as shown in the tourney results where 9 out of 10 are MS'ers leading the pack.  Lack of integrity throughout most members..no.. all members...\nglitches galore.. needing to adjust settings for each course I've played just to keep smooth game play.  2D grass.. lonely game experiance.  slow updates.  lack of support for people with disabilities.. (another plea that got ignored)  somewhat of the mob mentality in forums with the clique groups.  swearing.  abusive private messages from members that are allowed without recourse.   to be cont...a game built on constant lying by the devs. where it's their way or their way. taking too long to complete. where if one speaks his mind he gets banned from their forum.. even if it's a private message!  PP forums are run as that of an insane asylum where anything goes if you're English.  I can honestly say 3 of the crappiest golf courses I've ever played are karen, willow heath  and black swan. dark, shallow and full of problems. this is what to expect in the future when you have unexperienced designers from their community creating courses. serious lag on the practice course. delay on meter. avatar blocks certain views. camera is sluggish. promise of course forge by years end.. my bad.. they didn't mention which year, so they got that covered. and ...posts being removed in the pp forums by current members giving the tools by the dev's? because they are negative? REALLY?  well.. I might have copied a few and posted them on the link below if you're interested..including this review as it might hurt some feelings..I'm not sorry I am not a cheerleader for this craptacular game.. the problem with cheerleaders in the perfect golf forum and the reviews they give? like most cheerleaders.. no matter how bad or how good..winning or losing.. they try to pretend everything is alright..yes.. hit the link below and you can see for yourself how mods in the forums can delete a post they don't agree with.. yet use foul languge themselves.  devs choose forum cheerleaders to moderate the threads and they pick n choose what YOU get to read. and once again I've been banned from posting because I do not agree with the arcade style of gameplay. honest reviews are being removed to hide serious flaws and cheats in this game. All these negative reviews of this game popping up will be the end of imperfect golf.. the arrogance of a group of 5 guys thinking they can compete with the big boys of golf is a joke...  and to call any part of this game "perfect" is another laughing matter. 30 peeps on last night playing.. more like siiting in the game lobby? wow! this game is going places!

No modern golf game has come close.  That is until PerfectGolf was released.\n\nThe graphics are top notch and very realistic.  You can see all of the undulations and slopes on the fairways/greens very clearly unlike some golf games.  The addition of trees and bushes from SpeedTree last year improved the visuals a great deal.  The graphic improvements will no doubt continue in the future with the possible addition of 3D blades of grass using Nvidia’s Turf Effects tool.\n\nThe newly implemented Real Time Swing for controller and mouse has enhanced the game immeasurably in addition to the availability to download fine user made courses (around 24 available as of the date of this review).  That brings the current number of stock and user made courses up to around 37, a number no other modern golf game can touch.  These course numbers will continue to grow and grow once the CourseForge tool comes out and also once the developers start making licensed courses available.\n\nOnline play is great with turn based multiplayer and the ability to tee off with up to 8 players.  You can stop and resume your round at a later time.  There are loads of different play modes available in PerfectGolf.  If tournaments are your thing you can participate in many online as well as ones on onlinegolftour.net.  The game also has a cool replay feature that allows you to watch the last shot from a number of different angles.  Your opponent(s) can see the replays as well.\n\nAnother big plus for PerfectGolf is the freecam mode which allows you to more effectively read putts and scope out your next shot, even while your online opponent is getting ready to hit.  Take a virtual tour of the entire course from every conceivable angle and soak in the wonderful immersion that this game provides.\n\nPerfectGolf has lived up to its potential as superb golf simulation.  Every update over the last year has shown improvement, especially the most recent update from last month.  This community driven game will only get better in the months and years to come.  Be sure to give it a try and you won't be disappointed.\n","March 2","true","546.3"," 23 of 45 people (51%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","51","23","45","3","0"

But reading some of the other comments that may be just something about the latest release (it doesn't get any better using the lower graphics settings either). Otherwise, the courses look beautiful.\n\nI hope they keep up the good work on Perfect Golf - there's every chance it'll develop into the type of golf sim that's been simply non-existant for PC owners.\n","February 7, 2015","true","76.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

(old review) This is absulotely terrible! You can't make a game that looks sooo pretty but plays terribly. I have played every Links Golf Series, ive played PGA Tour on the Ipad, ive probably played every golf sim since the Atari 800 XL The control of the power bar is completely rediculous the swinginmg is way way way off. If you move your golfers position farther to the left and then take a swing and it misses the mark and goes just a little bit the ball curves to the left WAY WAY WAY left not equalling the strength and the way the ball should be going. The Physics are all wrong. The Mouse buttons to stop on the swingdown is not consistant and sometimes it does not respond ir it responds late and the swing goes way to the left or the right.  There are not any cheers or announcers.  Links 2003 a game that is 12 years old plays better than this game, it may not look as animated and as perty as this game but at least you can have fun playing the game. This being said this is still in BETA and Im really hoping this game improves cause wasting $20 doesnt make me a happy camper.\n\nUPDATE**************** Ok im Liking it more the past 2 days. Ive figured out that i can change the settings to make it easier for starters. I was playing the Pro setting. Also the swing is easier than i thought HOWEVER its way too sensitive sending the ball right or left even if your barey left or right of the downswing marker. I have a pretty good PC with lots of memory and 3 core etc the graphics are very choppy when set to best, so I lowered it and it playes great and even though its not on the highest settings it looks 420X better than LINKS, Tiger Woods etc.. I wish there were more sounds of people clapping , announce team etc..

Beautifully rendered golf courses are a pleasure for the eye but the real secret is what lies behind the surface.  Their use of real life physics in real time within the game creates a golf gaming experience that is unrivaled.  It is quite amazing how well it recreates the "feel" of golfing and that may well be the magic ingrediant that this game has.  Considering that this is early access it boggles my mind as to where the developers may take this game in the future.  If they keep this up, and I have no doubt they will, this game should become the gold standard in golf simulation.","January 26, 2015","true","053.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

When things are added, and it is finally completed it will feel very competitive.  I am hoping we have character creation, as well as tournaments, or tours.  A levelling system would also be great, or some sort of handicap system.\n\nI have played golf for many years,and can play as good as the characters in this game, so I would say the ball flights are extremely accurate.  It's highly realistic, however it's a bit boring with limited game modes, so not sure If I was happy paying the £15 to begin with.  Though it will be great to be a part of the creation of a full game, with hopefully things added to the game before it goes on retail sale.\n\nA few games here and there in the build up to full release will do me for now.","January 26, 2015","true","58.3"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","6","12","0","0"

My loss.\n\nUpdate: I tried playing this game again and it just kept crashing lol, no one was on, the lobby chat was off, and the first thing I did was hit a fade, then the game crashed. When I bougt this game it actually ran fine, now it's only gotten worse.\n\nI hate seeing this in my game list.

It has the look and feel of the PGA Championship PC game that I used to play, but Perfect Golf has the advantage of a strong and growing on-line capability thanks to STEAM. I have just several minor complaints about the game.\n\nFirst, I wish that the wind was more of a factor in the game to make players think a little more about how to shape shots. Clever  players could then hit fades and draws on purpose to hold the ball against the wind, or use the wind more to move around dogleg corners depending on the situation.\n\nSecond, I don't believe that players are penalized enough when hitting into or out of the trees. I have seen many shots go right through the trees like they were thin air, when in real golf the tree limbs or leaves would have knocked the ball down. Fairway bunker shots also seem a little too easy compared to real golf.\n\nLastly, I suspect that some of the players out there that are using the Motion Plus method to swing the club are using a track or some other kind of aid to move their mouse perfectly each time. It's too much of a coincidence that they have the same shot shape everytime, especially when consistently hitting it with over 100% power. That creates an unfair advantage over those players who use the tri-click method. I recommend that you allow just the tri-click method for on-line play to guarantee that no player has an advantage over any other.","June 6, 2015","true","397.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

Didn't have to spend a year to learn the game as you can be shooting in the seventies by the second round as I was. It is not easy from there. It shall be many months before I could claim a round average in the low seventies even playing on the easier of the two modes of operation and on the easiest of four settings within that mode. You will get value for money with this game as I see myself never mastering it. The quality of the courses I believe are of a very high standard, better than any other golf sim to date. The in flight ball physics are, in my opinion, near perfect.  Some other ball physics, not so good. Irregular bounce and bounce height need to be tweaked, ball travels too freely through heavy long grass, inconsistent spin on and around greens and ball holds on a bunker face. There is no lie indicator and once on the green the putting, in general, I found it to be a little easy.\n\nBut it is early access and as it is with early access there is some work to do which the PP team are already at it. I have no doubt that the team behind this game have their hearts in it and in my opinion they are in this for the long haul, because of this I am unable to see this venture falling over. The game has huge potential.","January 28, 2015","true","356.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

Well IMO they are certainly well on the way.\n\nWork continues to keep adding and updating, but what is already available:- varition of skill levels and assists, various swing modes already available (with more being worked on), multiple methods of gameplay, solo or multiplayer, variable weather options, great graphics and sounds, real time ball flight physics and smooth gameplay, for any true virtual golf fan, this title is well worthy of a place in your golf game library.\n\nWith only older versions of the Links and TW series still available on PC, virtual golfers were crying out for something to replace them. Well for me, Perfect Golf is definitely one of the current available option worth taking a look at.","November 13, 2015","true","482.9"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","10","20","2","0"

It was already a solid performer with its 3-click and Motion Swing (mouse) swing interfaces. but the all new Real Time Swing - Mouse (RTS-Ml) and Real Time Swing - Controller (RTS-C) broadens the appeal of the game by more dynamically engaging the senses in a live process.\n\nBoth RTS-C and RTS-M require a sensual mastery over an analog control mechanism that has a reasonable and rewarding learning curve.  There are also 5 levels of difficulty to help you wade into the world of real time swing interfaces at a level suited to any skill set.  I've been a real time swing controller fan since Links 2004 on the original XBox, and Perfect Golf's RTS-C has finally taken a controller swing interface through the portal that Links 2004's opened and added dimensions to its performance that uncannily model the nuances of a golf swing in a manner I wouldn't have ever dreamed would be possible with a controller.\n\nI'm a slightly better than average skill player, and I've managed to break par only 3 times in 50+ rounds, using "Hacker" difficulty (the scale runs Beginner, Hacker, Amateur, Pro, Tour Pro) with my XBox 360 wired controller.  Some would say that someone who's used to shooting 62 - 66 in a computer golf game would be frustrated by this.  Au contraire, I find it stimulating to be challenged to fully think out and execute every shot.  A fairway or green in regulation is something you don't take for granted with RTS-C.  What keeps me going is I am seeing a gradual improvement in my game as I become more familiar with the intricately scaled analog interace the game uses.  I'm probably only a few weeks away from stepping up to Amateur!\n\nPerfect Golf has so much more to offer besides its cutting edge interface options.  Its course creation suite called "Course Forge" has already given birth to a couple dozen user created courses, many of which are commercial quality.  RobC's Bandon Dunes is as good as any of the stock courses that come with the game.  PG also has a bevy of multiplayer options in its Multiplayer Lobby, in addition to having an ongoing chat room from which you can discuss the game and learn from others.  There's also a facility to support user created tournaments that is proving to be popular with community sites like OnlineGolfTour.net, which hosts a number of Tours and Tournaments of various difficulty and control types, in addition to reviewing and hosting downloadable, user created courses.\n\nKeep in mind that Perfect Golf is still in Early Access and is still being refined.  It's highly playable in its current form, but it's also interesting to see the degree of enhancements this game is getting in these final stages.  The developers are also open to user input in these final stages of the game's birth so feel free to sign up at PerfectParallel.com and weigh in with your opinions, experiences, and suggestions.   Whether you're a casual player or a die-hard sim-head, You're not going to find a better value for $19.99!","March 2","true","367.4"," 38 of 76 people (50%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","50","38","76","11","8"

I own others but now only play this one. The big difference for me is the swing mechanic. On the higher difficulty settings the real-time-swing actually requires a skilled effort at the swing. Other games I have played recently (such as TGC) are OK but the swing on those just seems so easy - also like you go on auto-pilot when swinging - and gets a little boring. Not so with Perfect Golf as you need to pay attention to your swing.\n\nI also like that the physics of the game determine where the ball ends up - it is not predetermined as some other games are.\n\nGraphics are decent as well, but I don't have a high end video card and so cannot comment much on that aspect. All I can say is that it is comparable to other recent PC golf titles I have played.\n\nAs for the number and variety of courses, it is getting better now with more user-designed courses being released.  In my opinion the variety and quality of courses is what is important rather than sheer numbers. Currently, even in early access, I see variety of courses in Perfect Golf getting better and better. They are quality tracks with a good range of difficulties available.  As the Perfect Golf course designing community grows there will be even more courses of varying visual styles getting released on top of an already great set of courses.\n\n\n\n\n","March 3","true","397.1"," 11 of 22 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","11","22","2","0"

I've played probably over 125 rounds, maybe more.  I will recommend this game based on the fact there is nothing else out on the current market like it.\n\nFirst of all Links 2003 had set the standard for PC golf back in the day.  Best sim with the most user created free courses and game functionality.  Not many bigger title golf games have really come out since then.  That being said, this game does a couple of things better than the predecessor, but is still missing the mark in some key areas.\n\nPros:\n\n- Beautiful Graphics (obviously better than Links 2003)\n- Nice simulation physics\n- Realistic environment sounds\n- Good amount of courses for the new user\n- UI pretty simple to figure out\n- Multiplayer and Private Matches work well\n- UIpcoming User Created Course Library starting to grow\n\nMIsses\n\n- No commentary? Doesn't have to be a celeb.  Game feels a tad lifeless without it\n- Sound file sharing - Ok I am going to be nit picky but you should have the ability to play sound files during your game whether it be in a window(snap cam) or some other way. This was one of the best features of Links that should be standardized in every golf game.\n- The settings to go up and down on your shots doesn't affect the ball hardly at all.\n- Some default options missing\n- Why is it every time I want to see the overhead view snap cam I have to click the button? Why can't I check a setting to leave it on? Or have the button clicked deafult to that until it's clicked off.\n- Default view of a friend playing is at an angle. I understand you can move the view around manually every time but why cannot there not be a setting to default that view to straight on like your own shot?\n- $5 for an expansion course? (Bethesda)\n\nOverall I am still enjoying and playing this game.  All of my default option gripes probably wouldn't be that big of a deal to fix. The commentary I am sure could be a lot more complicated.  At the end of the day, this is a beautiful modern fun golf sim that doesn't quite have the functionality as it's long ago predecessors.","May 11","true","165.4"," 11 of 22 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","11","22","2","1"

I bought the game as soon as it came out on Early Access.\n\nHowever, that doesn't make me a fan. It makes me a fan of golf games. Here are some Pros and Cons in my experience with PG on release:\n\nPros:\n- numerous swing options - there are multiple though I'm a three clicker all the way and very impressed by the smoothness of the meter\n- various levelsof challenge - play this with all the aids on and you'll be in birdie city. Play this without them and you might be lucky to break 90. I'm not nearly as good as I once was, but at one point I was in the top 10 on Case's Ladder on Links and #1 on another ladder. So I'm glad it's challenging rather than the "Shoot 48 at Augusta on Tiger Woods" mode.\n- good physics - I'm still not happy with the backspin but the physics are good and better than any other golf game\n- weather / time of day settings\n- many, many different courses to choose from\n- multiple modes of gameplay, including solo, multiplayer and tournaments with match play, team play, alt shot, etc.\n- no micro-transactions that improve your game\n- no stupid characters that drive the ball 400 yards\n- continued improvement of the game\n\nCons:\n- no career mode built into the game yet\n- course designer hasn't been released yet (supposedly this thing is super powerful)\n- I don't like the way the skies look (personal thing but the sunsets in this game suck)\n- limited current player animations (no lefties, no females yet though they're coming)\n- very limited character customization\n- it requires a decent computer and user made courses don't always run well\n- slightly too limited shot shaping options. I wish I could position my swing path and feet differently to get inventive when shotmaking.\n- very limited stats\n- no announcer and limited sound effects\n- no Steam Workshop integration (a cardinal sin for a game with downloadable courses)\n- really poor and frankly butt-ugly user interface when you enter the game (though it's fine when actually playing a round)\n- it was just released so I'm sure there are bugs\n- the risk of microtransactions that improve your game (they promised not to do this but still...)\n\nSo it's up to you whether to buy it. I can tell you it's a better game than that "other" golf game on Steam and probably the best one available on the market today. But it's by no means "perfect" yet (pun intended) though I expect over time that many of the current "cons" will get fixed. There are already plans for career mode. The designer already exists in beta. They're adding in more player customization and stats. That stuff is all coming.\n\nIf you want a golf game now, this is the one to buy becuase frankly it's probably your only decent choice. Since I'm a fan of the old Links games and golf games in general, PG gets a thumbs up from me now. However, if the new features aren't released - or done badly - I will change this review.","May 5","true","32.6"," 14 of 29 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","14","29","0","1"

Surprise that it was not more expensive and surprise as to the emotions it generated. I have been a golf player for over fifty years, not a good one, probably a bad one, but I enjoyed the challenge of the course and the chat with my playing partner. This is the first simulation that I have ever played that generates all those same emotions. The satisfaction at a great shot, the disbelief when the very next shot takes you into the rough, the failure to understand where it went wrong! It is an amzing simulation. I know the golf angle are sometimes peculiar, especially when stand up hill on a steep incline, I know that recovery from that situation is a lot easier than in real life, but wow! I love it.\n\nDo not wait for the retail version, get in there on early access and start enjoying the experience. It also helps the development as this is just a small indie operation.

This is the real deal.\n\nThe game can be as hard as you want it to be. Want to go easy on a flat green course using 3 point click on Beginner? Go for it. After a while, you'll birdie too often and want more of a challenge. No problem. There's Hacker, Amateur, Tour, and Tour Pro that'll challenge you further. These higher difficulties make swing timings more precise, resulting in shots more prone to shank if you're off just a bit. At the highest levels, you won't even be told the wind speed or direction and will have to rely on visual cues like the flag's movement. This says nothing of additional round settings like wind speeds (which can be set to weather forecasts), pin placements, green firmness, etc. You'll botch plenty of shots at first until you practice to get your swing down while you learn to master both courses and conditions. Just like in real golf.\n\nBeyond that, there are different swing styles that change ball striking experience. Want to feel like you're actually swinging something on your PC without a gamepad? Motion Swing allows you to use your mouse as a club to swing. You'll have to literally swing back and forward both straight and within a backswing-to-forwardswing time frame ratio in order to hit your shot straight. If you have a controller, you can use joysticks.\n\nThis is a game with a great deal of depth and multiplayer replayability with a learning curve as steep as you make it. Still, the game launched a bit prematurely. The multiplayer lobby is quirky, at best; dysfunctional, at worst. Computer opponents are wildly inconsistent, too, so to play a decent opponent, you'll have to put up with the lobby's quirkiness or practice on your own.\n\nIn spite of all of this, if you're pleased enough with the gameplay, you'll be patient in waiting for patches to remedy the game's weaknesses.\n\nThere are negative reviews about season passes that are misinformed. These passes are for additional equipment you can buy to actually hit golf balls into a net and track their flight in-game, which seems like a pretty dang cool add-on if you ask me. The developers are in no way forcing customers to pay for the base game and a season pass to play for a year.\n\nThe store also offers additional courses to purchase—currently Bethesda for $4.99. There is unwarranted outcry about this as well because the game comes bundled with plenty of courses to keep the gameplay varied enough for a good while—14 full courses if my count is right, and 2 practice ranges. Offering additional DLC content to the core game is exactly what a lot of developers do these days. It's not in the base game, so therefore, you pay more for it. Sounds fair enough.\n\nAll in all, the strengths far outweigh the weaknesses. I do hope the developers continue to flesh out the kinks, but they've managed to produce a very solid game with gameplay that'll keep you coming back for more if the sort of golf sim you're looking for is both realistic and increasingly challenging. These two strengths make the game that much more rewarding and fun when you do get a handle on things and are able to be competitive against others in multiplayer matches.","May 6","true","84.0"," 13 of 27 people (48%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","48","13","27","2","8"

You can play different difficulty levels in the same game which is great because my friends and I don't all like the same swing type or difficulty.\nI am pretty sure you can also set games up where you can play from different tees which is great for setting up games between PC and sim players with real clubs.\nLike I said, I have played them all and even though PG is still not officially released, IMO it is the best option out there at the moment for me.","March 10","true","632.5"," 12 of 25 people (48%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","48","12","25","2","0"

It has been a long time since we have had the chance to play golf on the PC. Even in early access this game shines in so many areas. The physics are hands down the best we have seen in a simulation. From the realistic ball flight, to the ability to hit different shots - the game pulls you in. The courses are also fantastic and a glimpse as to what is to come. This is the key - real courses, real physics, and gameplay that gives you a "feel" of hitting a good shot. You can tell the dedication and focus towards getting the game of golf right and resisting the urge to putt fancy features in. The framework is there as the latest update shows some future options. You also get tournaments and multiplayer out of the box. If you want to join a tour from a hosted website, you can do that as well.

Both are soon to be options. I knew of TGC, but had never heard of PG until a few months ago. After playing both, I am leaning strongly towards choosing PG. Here's why. First off, you can play this across many operating systems. You aren't limited to Windows only. Secondly, so far this game is showing strong graphics without requiring the top of the line in hardware. These developers are walking a fine line in that regard and so far winning it. Thirdly, there is already a solid online community for this game, for people looking for casual play or competitve play.\n\nAs for the game play itself it is very intuitive for the most part. I did have to look up a few things that aren't immediately evident from just jumping in and playing (like how to change clubs or shot types) but the learning curve is overall low. The courses available now are all top notch with a few real courses in there, and there are a lot in development soon to be released.\n\nFor a game in beta, it feels an awful lot like a mature application.

It is quite advanced for an early access title.  The game can be very challenging or more relaxing, depending on what level you choose to play at and what aids you select to help your golfing experience.  I think eveyone can find a method to play to make Perfect Golf one of the most enjoyable golf games you've ever played.  I would highly recommend this game to all computer golfers!\n\nWhat follows in this review is a lengthy discussion of some of the features (not all of them) provided in the game - analogous to the list of options the game provides!\n\nI bought Perfect Golf when it first became avialable in Early Access.  I played the Links series of golf, and played a very small bit with the PGA/TW series.  To me, PG is bit more similar to Links than TW games, but it's not a new version of Links.  The game developments over the first 13 months of early access have come reasonably steadily and each one providing new features and bug fixes of the reported issues.  I have complete faith that this will continue for however long early access continues; with the present state of the game, I suspect it won't be much more than a few more months until release (but that is only my guess).\n\nThe game requires surprisingly (to me) high hardware requirements to get the most detail from the game.  The most important thing is you video card.  You really need to have a dedicated video card; an on-board video card will not deliver the experience that players will want, even at the lowest quality settings of the game.  However, lower end systems and middle-of-the-road systems with dedicated video cards can generally run the game reasonably well.\n\nPerfect Golf can be a very difficult golf game - perhaps as difficult as the real game for some.  However, there are many aids that can be employed to make the game more relaxing.  There are currently four options for input methods:\n- a "traditional" style 3-click swing meter suing the mouse button\n- game controller with thumbstick on the personal computer\n- mouse movement, now available in a real-time format, so the golfer swings as you move the mouse\n- golf simulator hardware (Trackman 3/4, Foresight GC2, SkyTrack)\n\nThe 3C swing uses a round meter which is pretty familiar to most computer golf players.  I believe the 1.3.9.0 update coming in February 2016 will have an option to make the player avatar move as 3C swing meter moves.  I'm not familiar with the controller methods, so I can't comment on this input method.  The mouse movement method allows you to change the direction of movement from vertical to horizontal as well as the sensitivity to allow for various DPI settings in your mouse configuration as well as various resolution settings for the game itself (4K, HD, VGA, etc.).  The mouse swing can optionally be set as a real-time swing.  I also cannot comment on the simulator input, but from what I've read from those fortunate to have simulator hardware, all very much enjoy Perfect Golf.\n\nI really enjoy the challenge of the game using a horizontal mouse swing.  I haven't tried the real-time swing yet, but I definitely will be giving it a go.  I like how you can control the ball movement by making a different path with the mouse, and thus imparting draw/hook spin or fad/slice spin as required for the shot.  The physics of sideslopes, uphill/downhill lies, wind and elevation effects in the game provide the most realistic ball flight I've seen in golf games.\n\nCourses designed in the Course Forge by users wil become avilable for all players very soon.  The previews of the courses as well as a few that have been released by Perfect Parallel with the game so far have been very good.  I suspect there will be many more coming, but I also suspect they will all of be good quality and not something slapped together in a few minutes or hours.\n\nThere are many modes of play (stroke/medal play, solo/team match play, and others) as well as the option to play online against other live players from around the world.  There are limimted number of official tournaments at this time, but other web sites, such as the Online Golf Tour or OGT, provide a very good complement to Perfect Golf.  I suspect after the game is release, Perfect Parallel will provide more official tournaments, but it's always good to have optiosn with other tournament providers as well!  OGT will also host user-created courses for free download/addition to the game.\n\nOne of the few drawbacks in the 1.3.9.0 build of the Perfect Golf may be the lack of a career mode.  Many computer golfers want this, but it won't be provided by Perfect Parallel until after the release of the game.  The ongoing development of the game after release should ensure that a detailed and realistic career mode will be provided, based on the attention to detail and reality that Perfect Parallel have exhibited in the game thus far.  I have no doubt that whatever is eventually provided will be very enjoyable.\n\nPerfect Golf is currently only available on the computer (Windows, Mac, Linux), but Perfect Parallel have indicated it will be ported to XBox One and PS4, although no timetable has been provided.  Again, I strongly recommend Perfect Golf for any computer golf fan.  It's a steal for the price and will likely provide many hours of entertainment!!","February 19","true","309.2"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","48","10","21","2","0"

The ability to play the game at a beginner level and then add complexity as personal skill and mastery of the game increases should keep interest up for a very long time. The fact that many courses are available now (some bundled with the game, one to purchase at this time, many on line by independent designers) is a further benefit for this game. I await the arrival of the Course Forge so I design some of my own courses.\nSome of the earlier reviews mention minor glitches in the basic game and in some of the add on courses. It seems that community comments about the problems bring about speedy updates. IMHO some of the glitches make the game more interesting if one keeps one's sense of humor. As an example, one course manifests a problem with the water hazzard which requires either learning how to play the bounce off the frozen surface or how safe is it to stand on the frozen surface while chipping back to the fairway.

The Devs have obviously worked very hard to add so much to the game, Such as new swing methods, including  real time mouse swing and real time controller swing. I think the controller swing will be a big plus to those that have played golf games on xbox  or playstation. Also now available for free are user made courses. While the Course forge has not been released yet to the general public those that were Beta testing it made some courses which you can now download and play in the game. This in itself is a huge step forward and with them being free it should open the doors for many that were a bit hesitant about the game. The life blood in my opinion of a golf game is the ability to add courses and play them for free. I know this was not the direction that  the game first looked at going but PP have listened to the feed back of the community and have changed their mind. This was a game breaker decision for me and probably for many more. The fact that PP listened and heard all the pro's and con's of free user made courses then decided that this is what the community wanted in itself  is not a small thing. How many times with other games have suggestions been made but fall on deaf ears. I can assure you I know of more then one or two. This isn't the only time that PP has listened to the community and either changed something or improved on it. That is huge for instilling confidence as a consumer that they actually do read the forums and not just pay lip service to it.\n\nWhen course forge is released to the public the list of courses will grow by a vast margin as many of us will try our hand at designing. Now some will fiddle with it and give up but others will hang in there to try and grasp all the challanges it will bring. Still the thought of getting real terrain data and to be able to create a real course with realistic terrain and elevation has me very excited. I too wondered if it was ever going to see the light of day but with this new update there is no doubt in my mind it will happen.\n\nSo if you want to try a different kind of golf game of one where the devs do  listen to the community (That of course doesn't mean we always get our way but heck at least they take the time to respond and explain why they choose a way of doing something ) Then don't hesitate to get the game. I think in the near future you will see even bigger and better things to come and if you love to play golf games now is the time to get in on the action. Come check it out at the PP forums. Yes there is a lot of different topics to sort through but you may be glad you did. I know I am.","February 21","true","131.9"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","8","17","2","0"

A recent update added quite a few community made courses (along with updates to the stock courses in the game) and also added several new swing styles.\n\nA wide range of swing styles are available:\n\nTraditional 3-click with a power meter\n\nMotion Swing with the mouse that has a meter on the screen (your choice of swinging horizontally or vertically)\n\nReal Time Swing with the mouse (your choice of swinging horizontally or vertically.  No meter on the screen but the player animation moves in concert with the mouse movement)\n\nReal Time Swing with a controller\n\nThe game can also be played on a home golf simulator.\n\n\n\nThe motion swings are my personal favorites.  Tempo has a large part in determining the outcome of the shot (as well as swing path and heel/toe hits)  so it's not as simple as straight back/straight through.  A truly wonderful way to play PC golf.\n\n\nThere are also a wide range of difficulty options so you can jump right in and enjoy the game.  The easier levels are a great introduction to the game.  Casual player or just want to have a fun round?  It's here.\n\nThe highest levels of difficulty are quite tough but it doesn't feel unfair or gimmicky.  If you can control your swing, you can still score well.  If you're not playing well, it can be a real grind, but  it is so rewarding when you put a good swing on the ball.  A great option for the hardcore sim player.\n\nThe course designs are beautiful and the ball physics are the best I've seen in a PC golf game.  A wide range of stimp settings are available for the green speeds, several firmness settings for the fairways, and several settings for pin positions.\n\nCurrently there are about 33 courses in the game, as well as a large driving range and a short game practice area.\n\n\nThe game is still in Early Access so things are still being worked on.  Things not yet included in the game but are planned for the future:\n\n-Career mode\n\n-Assortments of clothing/animations/clubheads/balls/shafts etc...\n\n-Course building software\n\n-More courses\n\n-Improved AI for the CPU players\n\n-Country clubs and tournaments\n\n\nThere currently is a REALLY good third party tournament site that hosts weekly tournaments for various skill levels as well as fun ancillary events.\n\nThey have an automatic scoring system set up that will keep track of your scores and stats after each round and maintains them on their site.  They also maintain different tours, world rankings, money leaders, ongoing season stats, etc.. and it's free to join.  A very well run tour.\n\nhttp://onlinegolftour.net/index.html\n\n\nI'm sure I'm forgetting some things but again, this is a great game.","February 24","true","601.1"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","7","15","0","0"

Each game has its own pros and cons, its own pluses and minuses; however, PG has shown me it is far and above best golf game out there.\n\nI am anxiously awaiting the 1.3.9.0 release due this weekend.

It's a golf sim.  It's targeted at people who want the feel of real golf.  Good physics, accurately rendered real courses, lots of camera options.\n\nThe game does lack a lot of features that modern gamers probably expect, career modes, avatar customisation, tee options etc.  But you have to keep in mind it's an indie title.  I'm not sure how big the development team is, but I doubt it's huge.  They've been making steady improvements and constantly provide informative feedback.  Progress has been slow, but the patient have been rewarded and they're getting close to a polished product as I write this.  Even those who have been hammering the developers with criticisms re: the physics are starting to quite down as adjustments are made.\n\nThere has been some controversy regarding the direction Perfect Parallel will take regarding a possible subscription service to play user made courses.  I too am concerned, but to give the game a thumbs down based on something that hasn't happened yet is unfair.\n\nIgnore the 6/10 average.  As a fairly cheap Early Access game, it gets an 8 from me.

This game is still in the Pre release stage (10/15) and updating gameplay and features.  I have played all the courses and used the different settings and features.\n\nWith just a standard mouse $7 cheapo the game plays pretty good and has the overall feel of golfing on the course. You can play 3 Click or with Mouse swing currently. The courses they have so far are really nice and some you will be able to remember seeing before as they are real PGA golf courses. Scoring was not too bad, it does depend on the level you play with and how well you can do with the controls on the system you have. I managed to break par on beginner, but Pro level has still kept me over par.\n\nThere is a gameroom and multiplayer to find matches. They have also just introduced AI golfers that you can set up to play matches with you as well.  There are several different gameplay options like strokeplay, skins, matchplay, etc.. You can change the weather, wind, stimp of the greens, tees. and other settings to increase difficulty.\n\nA Course Designer is coming called The Course Forge that really looks nice.  It does need to be used with Unity to lay out the Base Terrain. After you make your initial terrain you would use the CF to apply the different fairways, greens, bunkers, distances, tees, course objects, etc....\n\nIf you are looking for a Golf Game that gives you a challenge and feels like playing golf I would say go for it.\n\nPerfect Golf will make you think twice about how your are going to play that next shot.","October 16, 2015","true","133.3"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","46","6","13","2","0"

There are times when I enjoy it more than the real thing, simply because I score better.\n\nI do, however, have one major complaint, that being the lack of a full range of practice facilities. In the real world I spend much of my golf time practicing the short game; pitching, chipping, putting and sand traps. Unfortunately all one can really do in PG in the way of practice is go to the range.  I do find aspects of the short game hard to adjust to in PG (particularly chipping weight) and would welcome the opportunity to be able to go to a practice green, place my ball wherever I wish, and try different clubs, swing types, etc.\n\nI would like to think this is in the works and can appreciate the challenges it may create, however to be ranked a great, if not the greatest golf game, it simply has to be part of the package.

Course Forge and user created courses... I can't wait! The 3 point click system works well, the draw/fade controls are very impressive. The hole map is good showing where your shots should be landing for par.\n\nOn the down side, the biggest deffiency I've found is the post-shot screen... It'll tell me how far I've hit it, how far to the flag but it doesn't tell me where the ball is laying, fairway, green, sand, rough etc. I can only find out by watching one of the replay options (which are awesome btw!), sometimes I just want to get on with it.\n\nThere's also some work to be done on long distance rendering of the ball, not a big deal though. On rare occassions I can also set the aim marker but the player doesn't re-adjust, like I said it's rare and for an early access game the occassinal quirk is expected.\n\nI'm very pleased with perfect Golf, I should be going to bed but I might sneak in another round!\n\n\n\n","March 7","true","15.4"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","46","6","13","2","0"

It has a simulator interface that you can play "real golf" on these courses. Many options and more coming. This game continues to get better all the time. The new user created courses are also great.

Obviously, with an early access, there are things that are needed and things that are fine as is. So far, I can say confidently that the heart is beating in this game. Visually it's appealing and the game-play engine itself is a good start. Some of the issues at this point, I hesitate to mention, again because I suspect every feature and tweak I would like to see has been accounted for by the developers and they are working on it. That being said:\n\nThe menus need work and making changes to the settings on the fly is clunky. The types of shots are limited at the moment and needs attention, as does the power meter and putting helpers. Right now, they don't really make much sense and seem arbitrary. There's no way to punch shots through or accurately alter spin the way the real game allows. The power meters and putting grids also are somewhat of a mystery and don't seem to be designed to let the player really know exact measurements. This may be on purpose, but still this is a sim and not real life, so we need some way to benchmark our swings and fades, etc...\n\nIt needs a player history system so I can go back and review my previous rounds, and of course, it needs more courses. I hope most of all, the developers are going to be able to make a deal with the PGA for rights to their courses and tournament play, but even if it remains simply a non-PGA golf simulation, that's fine on its own. If you want to learn the game and progress without getting bored, I think this will be a good title someday. I hope it is sooner than later.\n\nadded: May 5, 2016:\nNow that the supposed general release has been pushed out, I felt I need to comment further on this game. As I said in my earlier review, the heart of a good game was there, and I was hoping Perfect Parrellel was working hard on the serious issues in the engine. Apparently, they are working harder on the marketing and getting Jack Nicklaus to put his name on a game that is FAR, FAR from finished.\n\nI'm wondering if the makers of this game couldn't care less about the gamers in Steam and are more interested in the Golf Simulators out there than can use this software. Because right now, us gamers are getting no love from the game.\n\nA few points for the developers, which I hope read this:\n\n...The putting mechinism is simply awful. Damn near unplayable. It's swing mechanics are inconsistent and clunky. There is no context to the power of the swing and they give little to no credible way to read the greens. It needs serious re-tooling before this game can be considered top notch.\n\n...there is no way to craft shots and the chipping and pitching is abysmal and inconsitent. You'll never hit the same shot twice in the same conditions.\n\n...the swing meter, which is the only way most gamers are going to play this game, is baffling and inconsistent. it gives no power context either but even if it did, you can never re-create shots no matter how hard you try.\n\nI'm holding out hope this will improve, but if this is now considered a released game, I'm not holding my breath that major changes to the engine are coming.","March 8","true","109.7"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","0"

Courses are beautiful and there are many of them with more to come.   A number of ways to setup your mouse for swinging your clubs plus camera angles and replay options make for a wonderful golfing experience while sitting down.   Really though, get it if you want it.

I normally just don't do it.\nThe reason i have taken pen to paper (kind of) is to explain how wonderful this game is. People have commented on how good value for money this game is but it is so much more than that. This is the best, most immersive game of golf on any platform anywhere. I have played PS4 games of golf, other PC games and none of them compare to the qualities that this game has. I am pleased that i was on board from day one and have supported this game from the beginning as it has turned out to be a truly wonderful game.\nWe are still in the very early stages of this game with so much more to come but the highest recommendation i can give this game is, if it was left where it is today i would still play on it each and every day. It is that good.\nIf you love playing golf, whether alone or with a group of friends or a bigger community, then look no further. If you enjoyed the old style links then this is its bigger beautiful sister..with all the bells and whistles on it that we could have only dreamed about back in the day.\nI cannot recommend this game highly enough.

March 2016 it is still in early access this is ok because I have been involved in experiencing it so my comments may  be of use to you. They are serious about making a great pc golf game and it is also available on other platforms they are not perfect in meeting their suggested deadlines; however, they do care about the gaming golf community and thier customers. Early access as of this moment cost a measley $20.00 and is well worth it - will not be a waste of time for you. This game has continued to improve and is continuing to improve. You have many swing types to choose from and all kind of options in how you set up the game so even a caveman could enjoy this game. Currently I have it set up to where I have to focus on what I am doing but it is not aggravating to me and I get anywhere from -2 to +2 out of 18 holes so it feels good to get under par but this does not always occur what is great about this game besides all the features of it is that you get more genuine feel that you are playing golf rather then just a golf game. This is not arcade golf you can set it on a moreless arcade level though this is the beauty of this game for example if you wanted to enjoy this game with a child they could play it too given they had some basic computer gaming skills but it can be made too to where you must hit a decent shot to keep it in the fairway and on the greens.

There's a real challenge in keeping your shots straight and hitting the greens with right amount of roll. There's also a tempo-based motion swing available that has a lot of depth and a somewhat steep learning curve. It's difficult but fair, and it's a lot more fun (for me) than the traditional 3-click meter, which is also available.\n\nBecause it is still in early access, there are a few bugs and rough edges, but these are slowly being worked out. It's a blast to play even now, and well worth the measly 20 bucks.","August 3, 2015","true","188.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

Real life golf is frustrating, but very rewarding if you can achieve success, and to do that, it takes some work.  This game is the same way, you have to put some time in to get some success - but it can be fun on the way due to the high quality courses available upon which to play.  I have been pleasantly surprised by the quailty of the courses, both the ones supplied by default in the game, and the user designed courses which so far have proven to be of as high a quality as the default courses.\nMy favorite method of play (swing type) is the newly implemented Real Time Swing - Motion Swing which is proving to be very immersive giving you the feeling that you are really on a golf course and not sitting in front of a computer.\nSome of the new courses and swing type changes is stirring more interest in this game and there is quite a community of active players who hang out in the lobby for online multiplayer games.  There is also a site which offers weekly tournaments seemlessly integrated into the game with nearly 100 players signed up at the tour pro level (the one I play).  I do not know how many play in the other level tournaments, I suspect that it is 100s more.  There are currently no additional costs to fully participate in the game, courses, lobby or tournaments (although the tournament host does solicit donations on the website through a button).  Eventually there will be premium content for purchase (licensed courses, and accesories which will only be cosmetic and not give you an advantage in the game), but that content will not be necessary to enjoy the game.\nThere will be a program called course forge which will allow anyone who purchases this game to design beautiful course the same way that the original ones were developed.  The current crop of user developed courses were designed by beta testers of course forge.  Course forge will come out when the game exits Early Access, probably sometime this year (but don't quote me).\n\nPluses - gameplay is rich, not repetitive, due to realistic physics and variability\ninterest in the game is growing, lots of partners/opponents available\ndeveloper is active, listens to gamers suggestions and incorporates improvements\ngame works on multiple platforms including golf simulators\n\nMinuses - game requires modern computer graphics power to enjoy smooth gameplay\nplayers who want instant gratification may be disappointed with learning curve\n\nMy advice is to purchase this game while it is still in Early Access as it will surely be more than $20 when it is fully released.","February 27","true","865.3"," 15 of 32 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","15","32","2","0"

WGT...almost always fighting abnormal winds just to make it a challenge, always spending REAL money to advance one's skill and/or enjoyment.  No shot-shape ability (and using the wind isn't true shot-shaping).  PG...wind is adjustable, if you want it you got it.  NO EXTRA FEES TO PLAY THE GAME PAST PURCHASE!

No fps's, fast rts's or sports games, just click and click some more.  This is perfect in that regard.  Unfortunately though, whie easy to play, the graphics are painfully dull and the ambiance needs work.  If you're going to stare at the screen at least make the textures detailed or the models more defined.  The default character golfer is pretty low poly, now whether that's a design decision because they're using Unity, I don't know, but I've seen higher poly assets in other games on the same platform.  There's not much in terms of default animation with the golfer either, not that he should scratch himself with the putter, but like other games, whn you're lining up a shot you move or adjust your positions from looking at the hole, crouching to line things up and then finally taking the shot.  The scenery as I said, the ambiance needs work.  Skies, clouds, birds, water, grass and shrubbery, all just sits with a simple state to move a bit.  Just small amounts of movement.  I'm not asking for somebody to throw a pie, but if it's going to be a pc game, put some graphical power behind it.  I maxed the graphics, but still, nohing cool besides maybe a lens flare, but lens flares aren't cool...so here we are.\n\nGameplay, yeah there's multiplayer and you can set up games with friends, but that's standard these days.  No silly side games or practice shooting in a range.  Just dive in and it's pretty shallow.\n\nI bought this for a twenty but that's a bit much, had I known what to expect I'd say it's maybe worth a fiver.  I wouldn't mind a refund but I won't lie, it's easy to play and it'll be great when I'm drunk trying to kill time.  My standards tendt to lower.\n\nI'd say save your money for a bigger studio release.  Maybe get this if you love golf but if you can play whatever you like, unlike myself with a physical disability, dear lord buy something where you can kill stuff and destroy monsters.  Do it...do it for those who can't...do it for me.","July 26, 2015","false","1.4"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","8","18","0","0"

However if you want to help in its development then this is the perfect time to buy it. This game as a golf sim has so much potential and can be very challenging if you turn all the aids off. There are patches been applied, but because it’s a small development team they are few and far between. The graphics leave much to be desired, considering its 2015, the graphics are reminiscent of a game released in the late 90’s, I am sure that will also be improved in time.\nThere are currently only a few limited courses, unlike TGC (The Golf Club, by HB Studios) there is no course creator, so there are no community submitted courses to play on, which is a real shame as it’s something that would attract more players to this game.  This game has been developed for PC and I think it’s due for release on the consoles too.\nIt's now been several months on since this game was released. Its had many patchs which has improved this game even more. The graphics are still retro, but there is talk of improving this soon. As far as golf sim's go, then there is nothing out there that gets close to it. The game play is really solid and improves with each patch released.\nThe introduction of AI and the horizontal swing meter has in my opinion improved this game even better. The AI still needs some tweaking, but it's great to play against the computer, and you can also adjust the AI's skill level.\nAs I've mentioned before this is the only true golf sim out there, so a lot of practice is required if you want to play this game well.\nIs it worth the price?..Hell yes, if you love golf, then make sure you have this in your bag.

The graphics rendered smoothly, the precision for power/direction gauge was perfect, and many golf swing settings automatically set up for you, such as the splash shot out of a greenside bunker.\n\nThis suddenly became the best golf game I have played :-).","March 13","true","5.0"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","4","10","0","0"

(wingedfoot). and graphically ive read positive and negative about this game, but i play on high settings, (not ultrahigh) and the graphics are down right beautiful,  better than rory on ps4 and much much better than thegolfclub.    as for the gameplay?  thats the best part,  using a mouse you get the tempo swing of 4:1 mimicing a real golf swing tempo.  and you get a practice range to sort this out with feedback to tell you how far off base you were with the tempo, if you struck the ball on the heal or toe of the club ,  (which meant you swing path wasnt totally true). all effecting the result.  it is SO NICE to have a golf game made for the true golfer. this game really feels like your faced with a challege on every shot , just like in real golf.  of course if you dont want that you can choose beginner setting and have an easier go at it.  there are online tours and tournaments , and from what ive read the devs are working on inplementing a true career mode that they say they want to be really good before releasing.  unlike some other games career mode which was obviously just thrown together.  new course coming, plenty to play now, excellent challenge,  what else could a golfer want in a golf game?   thanks for this great game.","March 17","true","83.8"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

There are loads of options for people who want a less challenging experience too...but playing with no assists is best imo.\n\nThe game will be packaged with CourseForge for creating user courses and having been fortunate to have a dabble I can say it is a wonderful piece of software, way more versatile than TGC's offering.\n\nThe game is in Early Access...so it isn't the finished article just yet. But in the 6 months I have had Perfect Golf I have played 300 hours and enjoyed the regular updates. There are 10 great courses included...hopefully the real ones will eventually be licensed.\n\nAlso worth mentioning is that Perfect Parallel do the graphics for Sky Sports golf. When you play, for example, TPC Boston in game (Massachusettes CC) you are playing the course as represented in Sky's golf coverage. I think thats a pretty cool thing myself.

The game is playing much better these days. Find myself trying to get a round in almost every day. Maybe the time away and the updates when I booted up after some time off did the trick. I run on a pretty quality system so I don't know if system quality (or lack thereof) explained the earlier issues. All that aside, it is running pretty smooth now. I'm starting to really enjoy it again. I have a few gripes but they're pretty minor. Would like to control spin more, especially on wedge shots. Can't seem to get legitimate back spin ever. That said, I love the challenge this game takes to shoot a solid score.\n\nAt this point, I'd really like to see the accessibility to the other features of the game get easier. I don't have any steam "friends" who play the game so I can never get in on any multiplayer matches. Would be really nice if the companion site became a great resource for players of the game. I would love to enter more tournaments, access a "career mode" (I don't think that game mode is available yet), etc. Also, I have no idea how to download all these courses that I'm seeing people play on. Games like "Banished" have a simple subscription model for mods and additions to the game. I can't figure out how to add those for this game. This could very well be a case of my own ignorance.\n\nAll in all, I'm changing my review to favorable from initially negative. Could be an awesome game in due time. Hopefully sooner than later!\n\n\n(Original Review Below)\n\nI can't seem to get this game to work. I bought it a long time ago from the early access and as far as I can tell the game has just gotten worse and it has been awhile since the release. I now can't even find a resolution acceptable enough in the graphics option for the game to work. Set the resolution too high, and the game is insanely laggy. Completely unplayable. Set the resolution to low and it's accompanied with a bunch of bugs. As I click the meter, the screen switches from wide screen zoom to regular, and then after I finish the swing, it goes completely black for a few seconds. Disappointed in the evolution of the game from the beginning. Best to focus only on smooth gameplay, and build from that. It seems the dev team has tried to add random features that really have never come to fruition and somehow they've compromised the quality of play along the way... Valiant effort. Still can be recovered I guess but we'll see.","October 10, 2015","true","104.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","1"

In all reality they want you to buy a game labled "Early Access", then sign up for a monthly subscription plan, so you can buy additional courses at a "discount"!  Really?\n\nThe game itself is OK, albeit I feel neither physics or game play are up the standard set by The Golf Club.  The world feels very sterile, and one advantage, true multiplayer, is really not worth much either as the number of concurent players that I have seen is only around 30.\n\nOverall, a disappointment in how customers are treated and the software itself.","December 12, 2015","true","5.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","6"

There are many Golf sims and I have tried them all but following Microsofts decicion to no longer support Links after 2003 left many Golf players frustrated.  Links did however have an excellent course designer and they are lots of great designers out there who continued to support the game and gave the community loads of great courses to play.\nTwo of the finest designers then started Perfect Parallel with the eventual aim of releasing this game.  I joined the kickstarter campaign and was thrilled when the game got the Green Light from Steam.  When the game finally arrived I was very dissapointed because the game looked great but didn't play very well.The engine lagged badly so I went back to Links I even made sure that I updated my graphics card to be compatible with Links when I upgraded my computer.  A year os so further on I have returned to this game and I can safetly say that this is a worthy successor to Links.The graphics are beautiful the game supports lots of swing types and you can impliment real time weather for most locations all over the world but these are just small details what's important is how the game plays.  A year on the game now plays flawlessly so even if you only like the occasional casual game of golf this is as goods as it gets.  Those serious about their armchair golf will already have it. One of the coolest  things about these games is the course designer.  The designer that came with Links was fit for purpose but course design was involved and time consuming to say the least.The designer for this game called Course Forge is simpler and more intuitive to use but is not yet available but is due imminently.There are already plenty of cources to download other than those that come with the game from the link on the introduction page from designers that have been given early access and the standards are awesome.  These are now being released at a rate of about 5 a month and this will accelerate once the Course Forge is availanle for all. It would be amazing to see further cources particularly some of the best designs from the Links series.  Mike Jones one of Links premier designers really needs to make the rest of his cources available for Perfect Golf time permitting.How about it Mike?  Who knows once the CF is ready I might just add 1 or 2 designs of my own. In the meantime I'm off to play the remaining cources that I've downloaded in rainy old Blighty.

I would randomize the number they show for power loss to make bad lies less predictable like have it say "power loss 5%-15% so you cant exact math the shot.\n\nCustomer service on the website is bad. I have had a support request in for over a week to get validated on the forum, no reply...\n\nBut I'm rating the game with my "reccomended". If you have been looking a golf sim, not a golf arcade. This will fit the bill.\n\nGame at this stage 7 of 10...\n\nThey need to release the course forge without having to pay $249 for a season pass. Not sure if that is thier intent. But it will be a loser if they do.","May 13","true","68.2"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","38","6","16","2","2"

And I wasn't even expecting a lot to begin with. When it works, the overall gameplay may be decribed as passable or rudimentary at best. When it doesn't, you will be struggling with all manner of bugs, glitches, and inconsistencies. From frequent crashes, to graphical glitches, to loss of chat features/interface. Admittedly, I am running the game on a near minimum requirements spec PC, so others may have a technically superiour experience, but I am, for example, literally unable to play two rounds in a row as the game crashes to desktop every single time I try to load a second round.\n\nMotion swing controls are either broken or the developers simply don't understand what the whole point of being able to play by using your mouse as a club is. (It is to give the player the feel of actually swinging a club, in real time, and therefore requires 1:1 motion controls and respective visual representation. Another game achieved this perfectly, in 2001.)\n\nUnderwhelming at best.

In my search for a decent golf sim I came across this title which is still Early Access. Normally I have developed a reluctance towards EA games, but Perfect Golf truly delivers the experience I was looking for.\n\n> The graphics are simply beautyful. Lots of in-game tweaks possible to match the performance with your GPU setup;\n\n> The physics in the game are almost as true as you expect them to be and truly unforgiving if your not careful;\n\n> different swing types: 3-click, RTS, interface with various swing simulators;\n\n> Perfect Golf has about 12 courses that are included in the download. Via internet you can easily download other courses;\n\n> Multiplayer is fun. There are lots of possibilities to create your own or join a player/official tournament;\n\n> The dev team is actively involved in reacting upon community feedback and improving the base game;\n\n> Excellent price/quality ratio in my opinion.\n\nThe game has various difficulty settings. I consider myself pretty good in reading the course and circumstances, but on serious difficulties my gameplay certainly needs a lot of practise. Which is ultimately rewarding in my opinion, because the realism is so high some practice really pays off. Having delivered a devastating start in the Q-school (onlinegolftour .net) I actually feel quite happy with myself after playing 6 increasingly better rounds.\n\nThere are still things to improve (player career being one of them).

The UI/UX desperatly needs to be improved. For example, the 'select' button could toggle an overlay of controls for a joypad as for me that button was unused and I found myself getting lost in controls.\n\nA strength indicator should be added - % backswing versus % follow through to give a measurement of power as you take the shot, coupled with a visual aid of how straight your follow through was would be great as sometimes you draw/fade when you feel confident your follow through was perfect.\n\nPutting seems to be very random. I found it very hard to get a consistent putt.\n\nDraw/Fade/forward/backspin seem to have very little effect for me, and the roll of a green seems to be a bit un responsive... but this could be because I've only played a couple of hours.\n\nNot a game I'll play on my own, but very enjoyable in its current state to play with a couple of people you know with voice coms on.

The graphics are superb unless your on a tablet and the dynamics are well developed. No game is absolutely perfect, but Perfect Golf is the best simulator available and has a loyal and polite group of player that will help anyone with issues. I bought the game in Beta for $14.99 and it was and is well worth the price.","May 3","true","441.9"," 10 of 27 people (37%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","37","10","27","2","0"

I would add though that the course that i played on seemed lifeless, i mean it would be great even in solo play to see some other people or a caddy or something. Also noticed a little bit of jitter on the comet trail when the ball starts to drop after the peak of the shot.\n\nAI is needed for solo play\n\nThe only other bad thing i can think of is the sound design, in florida glades i can hear the ambience track looping. This may not sound like that big of a gripe but once you notice it it becomes infuriating and to have the same sound effect on all 18 holes in the track... well just play it and you will understand. I dont know if this is the same in the other courses but this must be a testament to how good the game is i cant wait to find out cos it is a brilliant game.\n\nAlso. this is early access but i couldnt help but notice there is a pro shop... all the values are $0 at the moment but i cant help but wonder if this is going to become a game that ends up cashing in big style after its release. If you can win money during games thats okay but if you are going to be asking $200 for a golf club that absolutely obliterates any competition this game is going to go south fast!\n\nOther than that early access is good i like it and i will continue to play more of it.. And now im late for work bye","April 13","true","8.6"," 1 of 9 people (11%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","11","1","9","0","0"
