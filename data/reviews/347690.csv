If you like those old Genesis and Super nintendo sports game, this game is right up your alley. It's a top down Soccer game. I love soccer and this game is very very good! Soundtrack is nice. Especially dat opening theme is awesome.\n\nI'd recommend a controller with this game for ease but playing with keyboard is not hard at all.\n\n\n\n\n","June 30, 2015","true","1.1"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/demonfreek/recommended/347690/","demonfreek","Dean Demon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/demonfreek/","854 products in account","Quite simply "Natural Soccer" is how football games used to be in the 80's so if you ever played the classics such as Kick Off or Sensible Soccer then you will feel perfectly at home playing this great little football game. Before Kick Off arrived football games were pretty much the same with the ball being quite literally stuck to the player's foot but Kick Off changed the rules and we had total freedom and control of the ball as we do today in Fifa and Pes.\n\nWell Natural Soccer may just as well be called Kick Off as it's virtually the same, graphics are as simple and fluid as they always were but they sure do move nice and fast and really smooth as well and OpenGL really does do it justice, controls are very easy to pick up if you have played this type of game before but could take some getting used to if you haven't but it is designed to have total ball control which it does with ease so practice will be required. Soundwise there really isn't much to say as it just the crowd with a few whistles and kicks so it would be nice to have a bit more in there but it still sounds great for what is there.\n\nIn the game there is a league which works well but would like the addition of say a cup competion or indeed a tournament and just imagine online multiplayer but seeing as they are not in there and just the league this still makes for a good challenge but at least you can change the difficulty if you so desire once you start getting some good results, one good option would be to have a practice mode this i'm sure would benefit a lot of gamers wanting to hone their skills especially for ball control as well as free kicks, corners and penalties and i would love to see referees ingame as well but these are just minor things and doesn't detract from an otherwise awesome game but please do play it with a gamepad or joystick or you will just be at a disadvantage.\n\nFor me personally i have to say this brings so many memories back and one good thing i found is that having owned the game previously before it came to steam is that my saves were still intact and recognised that right away so i didn't have to start over, just to sum up that if you played those old 80's classics you will feel right at home playing Natural Soccer but if you have only been used to Fifa or Pes then you might not find it to your liking and may find it a little frustrating or difficult but it's there to be mastered so why not give it a go?","February 14, 2015","true","14.3"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","14","20","0","3"

Before the update, i was not on the fence as to weather it was a good game or not.  It still is and was a good game, with amazing support from the developer, who actually gives a damn about his product and the people who purchase it.\n\nHowever, the game felt a little lacking.  I felt less control than i would have liked.  I dont mind hard games and challenges, but i also dont want to feel cheated by the limitations of the simplicity of the game.\n\nThat is where the beauty is in this one.  You can tweak the settings to suit your gameplay style. The developer gives you the option to make this game your own.  With each update, he doesnt remove options for the player, he just adds more and more.\n\nspeaking of this most recent update, that is what got me to write the review.  I saw the update note and thought it was going to be the much anticipated player editor. While that will be an amazing addition when it eventually comes, this update was a welcome surprise for me.  Adding the sprint option to speed up gameplay and really let me use the open pitch and give me the ability to get around defenders was wonderful.  Then also adding the "easy" dribbling control to go along with it, so that it was really my doing when i lost the ball to the defense by being sloppy with turbo or passing was the icing on the cake.  I feel like i lose or win now based on my actions on the pitch.  The first touch is noticeable, i dont feel as though the defense is stripping me of the ball nearly as often as before, because i can turn and run.\n\nNotes:\n\n-This is a hard game, easy to pick up and play (especially with friends) but difficult to master\n-This game almost requires a controller to play, but the controls are tight and responsive\n-There are still some improvements to be made, but the arrow is always pointing up as this is clearly a passion project that deserves the support of anyone who is interested.\n\nIf you are a fan of the classic soccer/futbol games of years past, this is a title you must pick up. With a developer that gives great support and is always updating and improving the game based on suggestions from players like you and I, This game feels fresh and like its improving on a successful formula. I can now proclaim it is a great game.","May 26, 2015","true","7.0"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

However, last year I came across this beauty and although it had humble beginnings (the generic blue team vs the generic red team) I felt this could go far.  And it has...\n\nIt's a great little game which you can pick up and play for a few minutes for a quick fix, or take on a league if you have a spare couple of hours.  The gameplay is the old cliché - easy to pick up and difficult to master - and it can also be very challenging, often leaving me wondering how the AI cut through my defence with such precision.\n\nIt's refreshing to see a developer being so responsive to their customer’s comments - in its short life he has added two new control mechanisms, changed a multitude of settings and the game just gets better and better with each release.  This little game has big plans, and I can't wait to see how far it goes!\n\nAn editor is the next big step to allow players to create their own teams, and the potential that we could have another playable, career based soccer game is something I am really looking forward to.  If you like Sensible Soccer, Kick-Off or Total Soccer then do yourself a favour and pick up this gem.  If you like PES or FIFA, do yourself a favour and play a game where quick thinking and your actions with the controller actually make a difference!","June 7, 2015","true","51.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","4"

If you liked those games (KO2/Sensible Soccer) you will like this game. Nothing has quite captured the essence of those games until now. Scoring a goal in in the current generation of 3D football computer games (FIFA/PES) never quite give you that feeling that you earned it. In Natural Soccer, as in the classics from the 90s, it can finally feel like you earned scoring that goal again.\n\nBut a note of warning to all those that think that winning in games should be served up to them on a silver platter: it is not an easy game. You will battle the control of the ball as much as you battle the opposing team but in my humble opinion this is what really should be like. There are easier control options provided for those that really prefer this, but you will still have to earn that win all by yourself. And when you do win, you will want to feel that way again.\n\nAll in all a Natural Soccer is a good football (soccer) game for those that like a bit of a challenge.","July 15, 2015","true","6.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It brings me back to some of the old soccor games I have played on SNES and arcades. I actually was very happy that it had controller support. The game mechanics are basic and easy to follow. I do think the price point is a bit high, and would be valued closer to 9.99 or 12.99. Overall though I do recommend this game for the amount of work that was put into it.\n","December 18, 2015","true","5.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

(keyboard doesn't seem to have got much optimization)\nCould use a few changes to the score and name display at the bottom. (bit hard to see sometimes)\nNo player/club customization nor stats or info about them.\n\n\nThe pricing for the game seem's just a tad bit high at $15, would have been great at about $10-$13.\nOverall I'd recommend this game since it provides a polished experience with pretty deep gameplay, staying true to the formula which made 'Sensible Soccer' and 'Kick Off' great.","March 11","true","1.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

No one associated with this game has compelled me to leave positive feedback. Observations and comments, whether positive or negative, are entirely my own. If you would like me to review a game, check out: fiverr dot com slash ThatAwesomeTerr.\n\nBefore buying this game, make sure you own a controller. Gameplay can be frustrating without one. I wasn't able to find a keyboard layout, or any instructions on how to use the keyboard whatsoever. As best I could tell, these are the keyboard keys:\n\n- ESC Pauses the game/brings up the menu except when you're in Replay mode; pressing ESC again will not unpause.\n- Arrow Keys Control player direction.\n- A Slidekick when you don't have the ball; kick or pass when you do have the ball(not sure which).\n- S Kick or pass the ball (Not sure which); starting/goalie kick; unpause/exit menu\n- D Enter replay mode when paused; nothing when unpaused?\n\nLike I said, the keyboard controls are extremely unclear. In addition, if you absolutely insist on playing with a keyboard, know that you won't have anywhere near the same level of dexterity as with a controller. That being said, playing with a controller improved my gaming experience by leaps and bounds. It was only with a controller that the game actually became a lot of fun to play.\n\nFor a game that feels very casual, I was surprised by the amount of in-game options there were. They go beyond just setting the basic difficulty. There are separate settings for goalie difficulty, how dribbling is handled, camera angles, and more.\n\nGame setup goes even further. While there are only a handful of countries represented, there are dozens of teams to choose from spread across different divisions. The developer has even wisely incorporated a "Tactics" mechanic that allow you to determine how your team is positioned in the field.\n\nGraphics are simple, but colourful. The ball can sometime be a bit difficult to see, but usually you can tell who has it by what direction computer-controlled players are moving. There's nothing really more to say on that.\n\nA lot of attention to detail went into crafting the options for gameplay, which is why I'm so perplexed by the control scheme. It seems like a huge oversight. The developer should really consider adding some kind of keyboard layout or key mapper. If they really want to try and give mouse-and-keyboard players a similar level of dexterity, they might even try using the mouse to control direction and run speed.\n\nAt the end of the day, I can only recommend this game if you have a controller, though. It solved all of the gameplay and interface problems. As for pricing, I find it just a bit steep at CA$17 (USD$15). But, if you're someone who does enjoys soccer and wants a game with a great balance of depth and simplicity, it's worth the price.\n\nBut like I said-- use a controller.","December 17, 2015","true","7.9"," 0 of 6 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","6","0","0"
