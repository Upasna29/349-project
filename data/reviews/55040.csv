"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/recommended/55040/","thatfuzzytiger","Hobbes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/","3204 products in account","It's called Atom Zombie Smasher. Yes, there are zombies, yes, you smash them, with atomic bombs...\nThe title is as literal as it comes, perhaps second only to NZA 2 (read my review on -that- for more details) in terms of "It does what it says on the tin". Atom Zombie smasher is a variant on those old-school top down "Zombie outbreak simulator" programs that would show lots of little dots rushing around, some were coloured as civilians, and others as zombies, over time you'd watch the infection spread throughout the city, often leaving a small clump of survivors holed up in a dead end praying to survive just another few moments.\n\nThis is the logical conclusion of that program, it's a game and a campaign structured around the outbreak simulator program, with you tasked as the last remaining commander of the available defence forces, attempting to save as many lives (and smash as many zombies) as you can. To this end you're provided with a default escape helicopter, and gradually introduced to the toolbox of mercenaries that accompany you over the course of the campaign.\n\nMore than just a zombie infection simulator...\nThe game runs two distinct "beats", the first is the strategic map, a somewhat procedurally generated vision of a large city with lots of sub districts. This map operates on something of a turn based mode, so at the beginning of a given month, the zombie AI places outbreak counters on various districts, you then select a district to fight in, and depending on the outcome the district is either still infested, cleared out, or reclaimed and made safe for humanity. So far so normal, it's important to note however that whilst you only get ONE district to fight each month, the outbreak AI gets two, and eventually three counters to use, you're fighting a losing battle overall.\n\nHowever, on the upside, you -do- get some tools at various points, in the strategic map the two major events are access to a prototype cannon (Elephantbird) that allows you to utterly eradicate a district in the tactical mode (more on this shortly), and llama bombs, which essentially decontaminate a bunch of districts in one pass, buying you much needed breathing room. Outside of this, you'll be assigned a squad of mercenaries (randomly selected from the available pool), and you'll get to choose a district to "go tactical" on.\n\nGetting down and dirty with the undead masses...\nThis is where the outbreak simulator program is most visible, in the tactical mode you're presented with a moderately simple top down view, with civilians represented in a sortof beige yellow, zeds in purple, and your forces taking up various other colours. Left unchecked, the map will play out much like the software in question, and eventually all the survivors will be gobbled up, but you've tools to prevent this!\n\nBefore the tactical map kicks off, you designate your initial landing point for your rescue chopper (equipped with foghorn that automatically attracts nearby civilians), and you set up your various mercenaries. These range from single shot items like minefields, to ongoing and mobile defences such as infantry and snipers. Effective use and the setting up of choke-points can, if done right, result in you demolishing all the zombies before nightfall and scoring a hefty bonus (indeed, these bonuses, and saving lots of survivors is your path to victory).\n\nWe have explosive...\nThe game really livens up once you've got explosives, with the map turning from an often pristine cityscape into a big brown muddy pit. Zombies exploding in clouds of green as your artillery rains down, remote dynamite detonations at key junctions reducing swarms of zombies into kibble, and your infantry protecting choke points and keeping the zeds away from the ever dwindling number of survivors. Once there are no more survivors to rescue, the scores are tallied up and you're returned to the strategic map. Learning how to adapt your tactics to an ever growing outbreak, and racing to the victory of humanity before the zeds inevitably take over forms the core of the campaign.\n\nBlendo hits one out of the park, with an off the wall look at zombie apocalypses...\nFor a simple pick up and play title, it offers an excellent level of depth, combined with an offbeat and catchy soundtrack. The graphics are not much to look at, but they do the job functionally well (think of a 3D version of that outbreak simulator and you're pretty much there). It's very easy on the system requirements and provided you don't suffer any hiccups at launch, you'll have little complaint from the game. As a cheap impulse buy, it's hard to find fault and as such, comes very much recommended.\n\nVerdict : Essential","November 27, 2013","true","18.0"," 56 of 77 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","56","77","2","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/recommended/55040/","nourl1","Two Clicks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/","547 products in account","Atom Zombie Smasher is a super little indie strategy game.  The basic premise is that you take on the guise of a commander holding back the zombie hordes from overruning your city.\n\nIt works on two levels; first is the strategy where a map of the city districts is where you see the progress of zombie infestations and plan your next mission.  You can choose which military assets you take with you from: infantry, snipers, mines, demolitions, barricades, gas attracting teams or artillery.  Once you initiate the mission, the game changes to a tactical sub-game where you place your units on the map to best protect the civilians you are trying to extract from the map, while avoiding collateral damage.  To many dead civilians and you fail.\n\nThere are a number of tactical elements that affect each mission type such as: map layout, dangerous area which can explode if you are not careful, more or less time-limit & available/unavailable units.\n\nYou win if you extract a minimum number of civilians or your units are able to destroy the encroaching zed hordes.  However if you do not clear the map of zeds before nightfall more zeds arrive to swarm the map.  Successful missions reward you with points that go towards an overall victory target.  Units also receive XP to increase their unique zed destroying abilities and they can level up to increase those abilites to make them more clincial.\n\nThe zeds then receive strategic points allocated to some city district (1-4) which determines the strength of the zombie hordes and the difficulty of initiating a mission there.  This continues until you reach the campaign victory target.\n\nThough gameplay is fairly repetitive the addition of custom campaign options make the strategy and tactical aspects that much more varied.  Scientists can be found wondering the city area and can be rescued.  Each one can then be "spent" to acquire research upgrades towards 8 specific areas of interest including: faster xp gains for units, faster strategic weapons, resilient scientist, more destructive weapons etc).  You can have access to strategic and tactical weapons that can clear zeds from an entire district thus reseting the danger level there.  Just be aware of the monster-zeds! lol\n\nFor me this was a surprise gem of a game.  While graphics are just basic sprites, it really can grab you if you let it.  It one of the most intelligently designed games Ive ever played and almost perfectly balanced.  While the musical score and audio is fairly basic, they do a wonderful job of immersing you in unfolding events.  Best of all its a very polished game.   Even if some Mac users are having problems with playing it.\n\nIf you are after a basic but enjoyable zombie apocalypse survival simulator then you should pick up a copy when the price is right for you!","August 19, 2014","true","43.3"," 30 of 34 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","30","34","0","4"

It allows for the most accesible modding and mod creation I have seen, useful for getting any  kind of experience desired, from the easiest of easy to the most insane of modes. The cleverly designed units are great for getting different challenges, thought they can sometimes end up in such a way as to make it impossible to win. There are a variety of preset options for the game, which allow you to make the game go on indefinitely, let you pick your units and so on. All in all very cleverly designed. Even when you get bored of the normal saving civiians / killing zeds, you can play Kringlejammer the most hilariously overpowered weapon of mass destruction, with a bit of strategy to see how long you can last. It is suprisingly addictive, akin to a tower defense game but with a bit of a twist. The story behind the game is also quite odd, but provides some comic relief.\n\nWorth it's price?

Kind of like a tower defense game, but without a fixed base - the people you save are essentially what you are trying to protect!\n\nThe Campaign map or strategic view is where you begin.  Every turn zombies (Zeds) take over new territories. From these you choose a territory/city to attempt to rescue civilians from.  This will launch your team deployment phase - placing helicopter landing point etc.\n\nOnce each turn or rescue begins, you have a set number of people you have to rescue to be successful - should you fail to hit this number, you will lose that territory.  Should you succeed, it will become neutral.  Rescue during missions is achieved by clicking with the mouse to adjust landing zone for your helicopter in a way that draws the people away from the edges of the city where the Zeds emerge from.  During the daytime when rescue missions begin, this will be from marked entrances, but on sun down, more Zeds will appear from all edges of the city!!\n\nOnly people within a certain radius hear the helicopters horn and move towards it - which can later be upgrade - there is a delay until the helicopter arrives and how many people it can carry which you can also be upgraded as you progress.  You unlock new units to assist you as the campaign progresses such as mobile soldier squad, fixed artillery which you can place on a rooftop, sniper team and roadblocks to name a few.\n\nThe Zed get scored on how many people they 'convert' regardless of the outcome.  At the end of the mission you are returned to the main map, and scores are added up for yourself and the zed.  At set points totals fixed events occur, such as 'Giant Zeds' etc to spice things up a bit.  Also, depending upon the month/turn, Zed will invade other territories.  The ultimate aim being to out-score the zed in what is essentially a points race - for a large part of which you will be behind in until you discover 'Llama bombs' later in the game ;-)\n\n\nOverall it is a great little addictive strategy game, one word of warning though, it only has the one soundtrack, so if you don't like it, you may want to turn the music off altogether!","December 5, 2013","true","14.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Each mission was intense and more than not, brought you to the brink of barely surviving.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are solid, and your selection of power ups are your saving grace in most cases, though I found the basic setup strategy to still be key. Many missions however felt as though there wasn't a lot of room for experimentation on your strategy, but rather one particular set of placements would be the only route. This may have just been a personal experience, but it was observed anyhow.\n\nMy only complaint, or maybe this was intention, so instead should be a compliment was the Over Map and the constant "Won the battle, losing the war" feeling you got. It was incredibly difficult to determine which event to tackle next as you always knew that even if that battle was won, the odds were stacked against you overall on your return back to the over-map.\n\nI would still recommend giving this a go if you're a hardcore strategy fan. Although the graphics and presentation aren't awe-inspiring, the atmosphere and stylization work for this game.That coupled with solid mechanics make this a good title to round out your Steam Library.","November 10, 2013","true","1.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This is fun in a way I didn't expect when I first played it. My initial impression was that it was just simplistic and I didn't really get the nuances, but that changed after a few missions. The top down map per-mission is like a puzzle unto itself, and you need to take care of how you protect/secrifice alleyways and streets. Your upgrades will make or break your game, and there will be some missions where things are just totally against you, and you will lose more than a fair share of civilians. But you'll keep going back at it because this game's strategy is just too fun.\n\nIt runs on any system short of a 95' Mac, and as you go, the upgrades start getting crazy with the amount of building damage you can do.\n\nNot going to sugar coat it here, this game is great if you like tactical games, and has infinite replayability.

I'm not sure how I acquired this game, it likely came from a Humble Bundle or some other type of deal.  I don't usually even consider top-down indie games because so many of them are poorly done.  This is a great game.\n\nThe setting is simple, you are the government controlling troops in a Latin-america zombie apocalypse.  A very interesting settings since so much of zombie media is based in the USA.  The tools of war are not overly complicated and yet the strategy is pure and advanced.\n\nAs far as indie games go these graphics are good – granted its not really even 3d but everything is animated well.  The music is very good, its fun Latino music, but not overly brash for someone who normally dislikes that kind of music.\n\nThis is game is very good value for money because you could replay it over and over.  Even though its not a tower defense game I think this title appeals to the same sort of crowd.  I just wish I could get this on Android as I would pay $10 to get it on my phone.  The game even has a “netbook” mode for low-end machines, so I think its reasonable to think that my quad-core snap dragon could run it.","September 6, 2014","true","4.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Your job is to clear out and secure zones to protect citizens of Buenos Aires. The game is just laughably absurd story-wise with amusing little interludes in the form of comic strips all the while you deal with research and the constantly rotating availability of units under your command.\n\nCheap, fun, unique, Blendo Games provides an easy-to-learn, hard-to-master strategy game that involves Zombies, saving people, and dead-pan humor. Even better is that despite what it looks like, the game's developer did almost all of the work himself which is also a plus.\n\nMods are possible, and in fact easy to do as INIs are actually shared through Steam as well in-game.

There are some fun little tactics you can use, such as routeing the zombies towards your sniper or clustering them together for a well times artillery shot.\n\nA meta-game has you and the zombies battle for territory, lets you access new units and upgrade existing ones.

There is undoubtedly a way to beat it, but several things I prefer to have direct control over are never in the player's hands to begin with.\n\nAtom Zombie Smasher focues on rescueing civilians from zones infested with zombies. You have no control over the civilians on the ground; you can only send an evacuation helicoptor and hope all the civilians get to it in time. In order to aid you in this mission, you are given control of a random set of resources.\n\nThese resources are randomized for every mission, and it is this aspect to the game that I cannot stand. Sometimes you'll have access to attack dogs and snipers, other times you'll have mines and blockades. Rarely, all you'll have access to is blockades and a paltry 3 bombs with which to stem the zombie tide. Even worse, the challenges you'll face vary from times of day (fewer zombies in sunshine, etc) to superzombies that require a considerable effort to take down.\n\nEvery zone you lose to the zombies gets chalked up on a big scoreboard. First to a set score wins, and it's an uphill battle for any player from the start. If I had control over my resources, I might enjoy this. However, I don't so I can't.","September 11, 2014","false","1.7"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","8","17","2","0"

You can finish a game in about 30 minutes if you turn on the short game and don't mess it all up.\n\nSince the game is set up in the typical endless race fashion you can pick how long you want to play for, which is nice.

I've been playing it from time to time for about last 3 years (actually I've bought it during one of Humble Bundle sales and played a lot outside of steam).\n\nThe game is pure tactics stratagy, without some economics features. All you need is plan your operations, upgrade units' skills and replay a lot, untill you're able to finish a level almost perfectly.\n\nI don't know why some reviewers say that this game is "completly random blah-blah-blah", I can't find anything like that. I would hazard a guess, that they are just not good enough in hard-core tactics games. Let's say, if you don't know what it is to use quick-save a lot in X-COM (turn based stratagy series (the old one and the new one)), in Fallout 2, in Jugger Alliance, you might dislike Atom Zombie Smasher for its "hardcoreness", but if you like those games, well, I guess AZS is for you.","September 27, 2015","true","43.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

So based on this I feel it only fair to offer a better review.\n\nWhere to start.\nFor one this , for me, is a stupidly addictive little game. You basically have to evacuate cities of survivors using your evac helicopter and various Mercs (which you unlock along the way). Sometimes you get lucky other playthroughs you get screwed trying to clear a heavily infected city with just barricades and dynamite.\n\nThe game also offers a beautiful sense of "I'm kicking Zed butt and totaly own this game" and then turns the screw as you see the map atart to swarn with high level infected cites, more zed, exploding gas lines and the MEGA zed's.\n\nGraphics are basic but work fine with the genre of game.\nI love the music/soundtrack (kind of a 60's surf music feel).\nThe vignettes/story boards make no sense (which a lot of people have criticised) and are completely odd at times but this adds to the charm. There is alot of screaming at survivors as you near your target and they all run in the opposite direction straight into a zombie hoard.\n\nBags of replay value due to the mods and game modes availible.\n\nI have lost many hours trying new tactics, almost winning, rage quittting, starting a new game and repeat.\n\nIt's a great time killer and worth a look at once you can fix the audio error (as stated the is a fix if you look).","November 24, 2014","true","171.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

So based on this I feel it only fair to offer a better review.\n\nWhere to start.\nFor one this , for me, is a stupidly addictive little game. You basically have to evacuate cities of survivors using your evac helicopter and various Mercs (which you unlock along the way). Sometimes you get lucky other playthroughs you get screwed trying to clear a heavily infected city with just barricades and dynamite.\n\nThe game also offers a beautiful sense of "I'm kicking Zed butt and totaly own this game" and then turns the screw as you see the map atart to swarn with high level infected cites, more zed, exploding gas lines and the MEGA zed's.\n\nGraphics are basic but work fine with the genre of game.\nI love the music/soundtrack (kind of a 60's surf music feel).\nThe vignettes/story boards make no sense (which a lot of people have criticised) and are completely odd at times but this adds to the charm. There is alot of screaming at survivors as you near your target and they all run in the opposite direction straight into a zombie hoard.\n\nBags of replay value due to the mods and game modes availible.\n\nI have lost many hours trying new tactics, almost winning, rage quittting, starting a new game and repeat.\n\nIt's a great time killer and worth a look at once you can fix the audio error (as stated the is a fix if you look).","November 24, 2014","true","171.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Back from the olden days of Winter Sale coal and fresh indie zombie games. Actually, maybe it's more appropriate to ask if you remember that decade-old zombie simulator with the colored dots, because this is the fully gameified version of that. Humanity is on the retreat from the zombie hordes and it's up to you to evacuate the survivors from your region. You can select different infested areas from the strategic map based on the infection level (difficulty), and it takes you to a small city map where you have to plan the evacuation. You get a helicopter that airlifts folks (yellow dots) out every 20 seconds or so, and up to 3 mercenary units to help defend. These units are anything from soldiers and snipers to landmines and barricades. After each mission you AND the zombies get victory points based on the final number of survivors and zombies. New events occur as you both reach certain victory point milestones, and the first side to rack up the target number of points wins.\n\nSounds solid, right? Unfortunately, this all comes together to form a strategy game that's mostly based on random chance. Just like the old simulator, humans turn into zombies instantly when touched, and you better believe the survivors clump up around the landing zones like delicious stuffing. All it takes is one zombie escaping your best-laid deathtrap to ruin an entire map. This is further exacerbated by the fact that your 3 mercenary units are randomized for each mission. So while you're in good shape if you get your mortars and zombie baits in one mission, you're boned if you get stuck with barricades, mines, and bombs, all of which are one-use tricks. There's also random variance in the performance of your units; soldiers can miss, and your mortars can go off-target, ruining that hail mary shot you needed to save the day. There are a host of other frustrations, like how you and the zombies get points for holding territory, but you only claim territory if you kill ALL the zombies on the map before sundown, which is ludicrously difficult even if you have the right mercs for it.\n\nIt's a shame, too, because the presentation is stylish and weird, and there are some neat systems to explore like XP to improve your mercs and rescuing scientists to upgrade your other abilities. The story vignettes are compellingly strange as well and I still can't make heads or tails of the story, but I know Tesla and an antichrist baby are involved. Shame I'll never figure it out, because the game's just too damn discouraging and frustrating to get through.","September 18, 2015","false","4.4"," 27 of 56 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","27","56","0","0"

Reminds me quite a bit of this java zombie simulator thing I saw several years ago. For all I know it's by the same guy. Probably not though. In any  case it's a well written game. There is no huge level of depth to it in terms of plot but it's interesting and the tracks are great. I would strongly recommend waiting for this to show up in the next humble bundle or on sale. I can't compliment the game and the author's competency enough but in its present state $6 would be a better price point. It's not a matter of quality that is at issue, but the proportion of price and the scale of the game compared to others of its type. So don't let my pricing critique make it seem like the game is not worth getting, it definitely is. Just not at the present price.

Also it does have steep learning curve and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI for the civilians that will run into the zombies in an attempt to run from them(WTF). For some reason they run to their death faster than they run to their rescue.\nOn the plus side: it's a sorta-roguelike, real time tactics (with planning phase just before the onslaught begins) funny game with minimalistic graphics about surviving a zombie infestation. Also HIGHLY MODDABLE which is great.\nThe intersting mechanics: each side has it own milestones to achieve and the first side to reach the goal points wins. Some encounters are more defensive (rescue and not really returning fire) and some are all about destroying the other side. It depends on the resources at hand (mostly available mercs), the encounter modifier, the current situation and of course on the player itself.\n\nCan't say I'd recommend it to everyone but for 3$ (when on sale) is at least worth checking out.

The premise is to move out to various cities and rescue surviors by placing a "go here" mark that your helicopter arrives at every so often to pick up survivors. The game is seen entirely from a bird eyes view giving you full awareness of where the survivors are and where the zombies are coming from. Over time you earn various mercenaries and items to help. Snipers, soldiers, barricades, cannons, mines, nukes, and more. These can all be leveled up over time. Saving scientists allow you to buy various extra upgrades. You might save every survivor from a city, or maybe become overwhelmed and lose. You simply move from city to city saving as much as possible. The game is a race to see who can get enough points first. You get points for saving people, clearing cities, etc. The zombies get points for eating people, taking over cities, etc. Whoever reaches the point goal wins, so the game has a board game feel.

The overall campaign game also can seem overwhelmingly hard or simply too easy - it's a slippery slope in both directions. Also, some of the achievements seem a little buggy requiring you to restart the game to unlock.\n\nThere's a lot of value to be had here if you get this game on the cheap.

This sheepdog however has guns and explosives :D\n\nThis game can get very difficult, which is a definite turnoff for many. The difficulty I think mostly lies in the fact that the handful of mercs you get each round are randomly generated. A bad combination of mercs can ruin your fun but experienced players need not worry. The game controls require tons of micromanagement but there are options to slow or speed up in-game.

You are scored based on how many civilians you rescue, how many zombies you kill and how quickly you achieve this.\nThe storyline campaign features a map of Nuevos Aires divided into regions (the number of regions can be edited according to how long you want to play for or what target score you set). Regions are coloured according to whether they are infested with zombies, have been liberated by you or have had all the life bombed out of them. Regions are also numbered to show the extent of zombie infestation, with higher numbers indicating a larger number of zombies to kill.\nYou have access to a helicopter (which airlifts people to safety) and then attack units to use to help you kill zombies. Attack units include ground infantry, snipers, dynamite, road blocks, etc, but you can only use 4 attack units at a time. Once you have chosen a region, you launch into a square map with randomly placed buildings, roads and civilians. You will be shown where zombies will approach from and asked to place your units on the map in strategically chosen locations. When you're done, you watch as the zombies move in and the level commences. You can move a few units after placing them, but not for most of them, so you have to really think hard about where you put them.\nThere are comic book style cutscenes which appear randomly and explain the game's backstory. The cutscenes have a certain brand of dark humour which I find hilarious, but some people might not appreciate.\nYou can also adjust game settings to make things easier or harder depending on what you want to get out of the game. For example, you can start out with all attack units, allow zombies to spawn inside a region, allow mega zombies, etc.\nOverall, this is a game worth looking at if you like strategy games.","December 28, 2012","true","24.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It retains that style through presentation of the fantastically dry vignettes, music, and silly gameplay, and helps make it one of my favorite indie games from the last year.\n\nIt's an active RTS where you try to save as many clumsy people from swarming, clumsy zombies (and everything is just colored blocks). Maps and your set of mercenaries (basically 'powers', like landmines, artillery shells, moveable/invincible infantry, etc.) are randomly generated. Combined with very simple modding, it's good fun to play a campaign every few weeks and tweak a bunch of settings. All infantry, tons of super fast zombies, quick to flee civilians. It just devolves into clicking frantically and yelling (in a good way (see: Trackmania).)\n\nOne last thing: It can be kinda frustrating.

You are scored based on how many civilians you rescue, how many zombies you kill and how quickly you achieve this.\nThe storyline campaign features a map of Nuevos Aires divided into regions (the number of regions can be edited according to how long you want to play for or what target score you set). Regions are coloured according to whether they are infested with zombies, have been liberated by you or have had all the life bombed out of them. Regions are also numbered to show the extent of zombie infestation, with higher numbers indicating a larger number of zombies to kill.\nYou have access to a helicopter (which airlifts people to safety) and then attack units to use to help you kill zombies. Attack units include ground infantry, snipers, dynamite, road blocks, etc, but you can only use 4 attack units at a time. Once you have chosen a region, you launch into a square map with randomly placed buildings, roads and civilians. You will be shown where zombies will approach from and asked to place your units on the map in strategically chosen locations. When you're done, you watch as the zombies move in and the level commences. You can move a few units after placing them, but not for most of them, so you have to really think hard about where you put them.\nThere are comic book style cutscenes which appear randomly and explain the game's backstory.

I personally think the game fundamentals are solid, but you have to look past the cheesy graphics. The overall impression I get is Risk meets Choplifter with minimal tower defense and real time strategy elements.\n\nThere is technically no way to win--there are only degrees of losing. The goal is to rescue as many non-infected as you can or destroy the zombie hordes before nightfall. You are given a basic assortment of mercenaries for offensive purposes which level up as they gain experience, and it's only after they start leveling that the game's fun factor is uncovered; just watch out for the friendly fire! Achievements are always a plus. The price tag is a bit on the heavy side for my expectations, but it would be wise to download the demo and judge for yourself.

Sadly, this means a few great titles have been overlooked amidst the flurry of releases. Atom Zombie Smasher is the best of them. Developer Brandon Chung has always been a master of style - even his student game Barista 2 has more spunk than most commercial releases - and in Atom Zombie Smasher that style really meshes with the gameplay. The randomly-selected narrative vignettes are amusing, but this is a game that tells its story almost entirely through its gameplay. This is a real, horrifying zombie apocalypse, viewed with a clinical distance. You will try and save Nuevo Aires. You will lose.

It took me a while to beat this one.  There's what I call a "tipping point" to this game where you will know whether you can win the game or not.  If you're not doing well, you'll know after a few levels that there is no way to come back from the deficit. A few times, I made it halfway through to only realize I would probably lose at the end...very frustrating. You need points and to do well to gain experience for your troops, more experience means your troops will perform better which will be key to winning. If you just happend to skate by each level, that won't be enough to dominate.\n\nAnyway, I didn't like this game at first, but got into it to earn the achievements.

Also, some of the achievements seem a little buggy requiring you to restart the game to unlock.\n\nThere's a lot of value to be had here if you get this game on the cheap.

You'll fly in with a helicopter to rescue humans and this requires a lot of micromanaging on your part. You're basically a sheepdog, herding the sheep to safety. This sheepdog however has guns and explosives :D\n\nThis game can get very difficult, which is a definite turnoff for many. The difficulty I think mostly lies in the fact that the handful of mercs you get each round are randomly generated. A bad combination of mercs can ruin your fun but experienced players need not worry. The game controls require tons of micromanagement but there are options to slow or speed up in-game.

I personally think the game fundamentals are solid, but you have to look past the cheesy graphics. The overall impression I get is Risk meets Choplifter with minimal tower defense and real time strategy elements.\n\nThere is technically no way to win--there are only degrees of losing. The goal is to rescue as many non-infected as you can or destroy the zombie hordes before nightfall. You are given a basic assortment of mercenaries for offensive purposes which level up as they gain experience, and it's only after they start leveling that the game's fun factor is uncovered; just watch out for the friendly fire! Achievements are always a plus. The price tag is a bit on the heavy side for my expectations, but it would be wise to download the demo and judge for yourself. Overall, I found it to be a refreshing distraction.","August 23, 2011","true","27.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sadly, this means a few great titles have been overlooked amidst the flurry of releases. Atom Zombie Smasher is the best of them. Developer Brandon Chung has always been a master of style - even his student game Barista 2 has more spunk than most commercial releases - and in Atom Zombie Smasher that style really meshes with the gameplay. The randomly-selected narrative vignettes are amusing, but this is a game that tells its story almost entirely through its gameplay. This is a real, horrifying zombie apocalypse, viewed with a clinical distance. You will try and save Nuevo Aires. You will lose.

The overworld plays a bit like Risk. The city sections play very differently depending on what weapons you have available, and this is random. If you have artillery and snipers, it's not too hard to annihilate the zombies quickly. If you have roadblocks and bait, then you need to get everyone out quickly.\n\nI've definitely enjoyed it so far. The biggest flaws are its weak tutorial and the fact that a bad choice of random weapons might force you to concede a map. But, the strategy's good and it's fun to play. I haven't tried the local co-op yet... seems fun though.\n\nIf you like strategy games, I think this is worth picking up, but your milage may vary.","August 16, 2011","true","16.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unfortunately in here, the only way to kill zombies here are by your own hand with mercenaries, which you hire after each mission. You best hope your silly civilians don't run headfirst into a horde when trying to evacuate them from cities, for they will simply become a part of the evergrowing Zed horde. The game does have a VERY high difficulty curve as the first few level 1 breakouts turn into level 3-4 ones after you've gotten dependant on certain types of mercenaries (like Zombie Bait + Artillery), but you CAN make it with some very sneaky placements.","December 27, 2011","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It took me a while to beat this one.  There's what I call a "tipping point" to this game where you will know whether you can win the game or not.  If you're not doing well, you'll know after a few levels that there is no way to come back from the deficit. A few times, I made it halfway through to only realize I would probably lose at the end...very frustrating. You need points and to do well to gain experience for your troops, more experience means your troops will perform better which will be key to winning. If you just happend to skate by each level, that won't be enough to dominate.\n\nAnyway, I didn't like this game at first, but got into it to earn the achievements.  It's a very simple game, but done well. Atom Zombie Smashers would work well as an app on an ipad or kindle or some sort of tablet.  I created a mod which was fun. Music and sound effects were good.

Unfortunately in here, the only way to kill zombies here are by your own hand with mercenaries, which you hire after each mission. You best hope your silly civilians don't run headfirst into a horde when trying to evacuate them from cities, for they will simply become a part of the evergrowing Zed horde. The game does have a VERY high difficulty curve as the first few level 1 breakouts turn into level 3-4 ones after you've gotten dependant on certain types of mercenaries (like Zombie Bait + Artillery), but you CAN make it with some very sneaky placements.","December 27, 2011","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With unlockable power-ups and aids as you progress, the seemingly ever-present orbital laser beam in tower-defence games is replaced by the innocuously named Llama Bomb. The random naming method in the game fits well into the weird twisted world created by Brendon Chung and his Company Blendo Games.\n\nN.B As an indie developer (being pretty helpful), they have given users the ability to mod the game, and an easy way to insert your own cut-scene comics to make the game your own.

The audio and music is extremely immersing.\nControls: 3/5\nThe majority of the controls are LMB/RMB, however it can be easy at times to confuse which one to use which can cost you a round.  Of course, you can always replay the round if you can't accept defeat.\nGameplay: 5/5\nHealthy balance of luck and skill.\nEntertainment: 4/5\nChallenges the brain. Objectives evolve as you progress.  Not very rewarding if you win the campaign, however.\nReplayability: 2/5\nThe enjoyment I get out of the actual gameplay is what brought me back for a little while.  The Steam achievements contributed to replayability.  The lack of reward to winning the campaign along with the game just getting old quickly puts a low score in this criteria.\n\nFor the small amount that Atom Zombie Smasher presents, it presents it very well.  Blendo Games gives a small package with rich flavor in the market of zombie infestations.  From the 60's SoCo surfer music (my favorite touch by the way) to the evolution of your objectives as the game progresses, Smasher will keep you thrilled in your entire experience and just may have you asking for more.... But don't expect to be racking up 100+ hours on this game.  I feel like I got everything out of it in the 25 hours I played it.  I see myself revisiting the game for a campaign or two, however.\n\nI couldn't help but to be reminded of the old Atari games like Combat, M.A.S.H., and ChopLifter when playing this game.  You find yourself evacuating civilians in the form of yellow dots by helicopter in an urban theatre from a horde of zombies, or Zed, represented as pink-purple dots.  As the campaign progresses, you find your mission objectives evolving from evacuation to Zed elimination.\n\nBlendo Games delivers a game that challenges your brain as you are concerned with concepts like Zed/Civilian routing and great timing to meet your mission objectives.\n\nAlthough the overall campaign is solid, I was disappointed on the outcome.  You are presented the same ending whether you win or lose.  I feel as though there is little reward for actually winning the game short of giving yourself a soft pat on the back on close calls.  This leads to the lackluster of the replayability of Atom Zombie Smasher.  As you get better at the game, you may find the game too easy.  The parameters in the game you can set in the beginning of the game could spice things up but overall it's the same game, just way easier or way harder.\n\nThe cherry on the top to my recommendation is the price tag. When the game is on sell, you should grab it and give it a try.  You will find it was worth more than a burger at a fast food joint.  For a small brain game (a la Minesweeper) this game is fantastic.","December 28, 2013","true","25.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My advice is to try out the demo because it is hard to put how this game really works. Your objective is to rescue survivors of  zombie outbreaks all across the campaign map. These outbreaks take place in cities where you land helicopters, deploy infantry and snipers, set traps, and use artillery to make sure as many survivors are rescued as possible from the...purple dots. The game has a catchy but somewhat repetative soundtrack but the gameplay makes up for it. It also has some strange "humor", as articles that have nothing to do with anything and make no sense pop up on the screen. Most of the game seems to be based on books and movies I've never read or even heard of, so I feel somewhat lost on the whole setting..but I think that might be the point. The game has little visuals but imagination makes up for what graphics don't as you have to imagine why these survivors react the way they do.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/voltagier/recommended/55040/","voltagier","Voltagier","http://steamcommunity.com/id/voltagier/","884 products in account","In this strategy game, your mission is to rescue as many humans on the map, minimizing the number of them getting infected, while keeping the zombies at bay with various mercenaries and countermeasures at your disposal. You'll fly in with a helicopter to rescue humans and this requires a lot of micromanaging on your part. You're basically a sheepdog, herding the sheep to safety. This sheepdog however has guns and explosives :D\n\nThis game can get very difficult, which is a definite turnoff for many. The difficulty I think mostly lies in the fact that the handful of mercs you get each round are randomly generated. A bad combination of mercs can ruin your fun but experienced players need not worry. The game controls require tons of micromanagement but there are options to slow or speed up in-game. The graphics aren't anything special; everything's portrayed as dots so nothing much to say there. However, the art style and music are quite amusing. Overall, a great game!","February 11, 2012","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Also it does have steep learning curve and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI for the civilians that will run into the zombies in an attempt to run from them(WTF). For some reason they run to their death faster than they run to their rescue.\nOn the plus side: it's a sorta-roguelike, real time tactics (with planning phase just before the onslaught begins) funny game with minimalistic graphics about surviving a zombie infestation. Also HIGHLY MODDABLE which is great.\nThe intersting mechanics: each side has it own milestones to achieve and the first side to reach the goal points wins. Some encounters are more defensive (rescue and not really returning fire) and some are all about destroying the other side. It depends on the resources at hand (mostly available mercs), the encounter modifier, the current situation and of course on the player itself.\n\nCan't say I'd recommend it to everyone but for 3$ (when on sale) is at least worth checking out. If the trailer for the game doesn't scare you and you like moddable roguelikes (= high replayability) it is well worth the 10$.","September 18, 2014","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is really addictive, twitchy strategy, and you have more choice than you might realize when you set up a game -- you can choose whether you want random mercs for a greater challenge, or choose your teams, or add options to make it even harder, and a longer or shorter game may grant you more victories based on your play style. If you're frustrated, just change the options. Cute story, kind of nonsensically artsy, think Monty Python surrealism as told by Quentin Tarantino.\n\nThat being said, it can be kinda tricky to set up to run in the first place -- you might not have any problems, but based on your system, you may also sit there for an hour trying out different graphics and launch options through the forums and the dev FAQ before it runs, or before you can actually see the whole screen. Be patient, it's worth it, you'll probably get it running, but be prepared that you may need to figure out how to launch it. Not DOS-game hard to set up, but requiring more persistence than most modern games.","May 23, 2015","true","32.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Players are challenged by the mechanics of the game to always try new strategies and plan the location of each battle wisely.

They are a quirky game company so their games can be a mixed bag but that's very okay because they are not afraid to try new things and think outside of the box. Atom Zombie Smasher mixes RTS, tower defense, and a bit of turn based strategy. The object of the game is to rescue civilians from cities that are under zombie attack. While rescuing them, you fend off the zombies with mercenary teams that you acquire throughout the campaign. You also have to try to capture cities and strategically select cities to rescue to help stop the spread of the zombies. It's kind of like the board game, Pandemic, mixed with some tower defense. The visuals in this game are very simplistic. People and zombies are represented by cubes. It may seem like a silly decision but it actually helps to maintain a fun atmosphere to the game to have colorful cubes running around the city. Most zombie apocalypse games have dark and gritty atmospheres to create a horror setting. You won't find that here. Atom Zombie Smasher is all about the strategy and the frantic game-play. Add a "Christmas" mini-game, co-op, and mod support and you've got a great game.\n\n9/10","May 24, 2015","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Zombies are invading the 1960s city of Nuevos Aires, and you are tasked with evacuating the populace from each district from your orbital platform.\n\nEach month, you can take on one mission and try to rescue as many civilians as possible.  Everything is procedurally generated, from the city limits to the levels to even the names of your mercenary squadrons.\n\nThe city grid is full of little yellow cubes, which represent citizens.  Zombies will come pouring in from side streets in a wave of purple cubes.  If they touch a citizen, it will instantly be turned.  A sure-fire victory can be instantly turned to defeat by one lone zed wandering into a clump of defenseless people.  You’ll need to mitigate this risk by carefully deploying and directing your troops.\n\nAs the game goes on, you’ll receive new and interesting units to deploy, though you’ll only get a random assortment of them each round.  This keeps things challenging, as you can’t take on a completely infested level with just a single mortar.  You’ll need to decide each round how hard of a level you think you can complete with your ever-changing arsenal.  Your different units can level up and improve their capabilities, and you can even recruit scientists to give you some bonus powers.  The Llama bombs are especially game-changing.   You only have a set time to evacuate citizens before night falls and zeds come pouring in from every angle, almost ensuring any remaining citizens will die.  This puts a soft cap on the length of time a level can take; most will last 3 minutes or less.\n\nLet’s talk about that music!  A handful of upbeat, cheerful tracks of what I would term “Beach Rock” add a layer of dissonance to the disturbing proceedings taking place below.  Jamming guitars and pounding drums make you so happy to be mowing down zombies and abandoning people to die just so you can save a few others!  But its OK, you’ll say, because they’re just cubes anyway.  They turn purple.  That’s a nice color.\n\nThe campaign mode offers a big list of customization options so you can set it to be as hard or as breezy as you’d like.  You can also remove some of the randomization and select your squads at the beginning of each month, which is a feature I really liked.  Oh, and there’s also a set of backstory vignettes you can collect to tell you about the history of Nuevos Aires and how the outbreak occurred.\n\nAtom Zombie Smasher is a weird, cheerful, bright zombie-slaying game.  Sometimes you just need to rescue some little cubes from certain death, blowing up other cubes to buy some time.  AZS lets you do that to a totally rad soundtrack.","December 13, 2015","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A fair amount of the game is randomized so it always feels fresh.  I went into this game for steams summer achievement but found I was still playing it long after the achievement had popped. Quite addicting and very unique in its style and gameplay.\n\nYou atart off in a zombie apocolypse and are a commander controlling mercernaries.  You pick a place on the map to try and rescue civilians while killing zombies.  At first you don't start with much (just a rescue helicopter) but eventually you get demolitions mercs, barricades, mines, infrantry, snipers, artillery and even some super weapons to help you destroy all the zombies on a map.  I could go on about how deep the game can get but just give it a try for yourself if you have a few dollars to spare.","July 8, 2011","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The player places units, barricades, and explosives in the planning stage, then during the real-time portion maneuvers/uses them in order to slow the zombies from reaching the civilians before they can be rescued. As missions go by, the player acquires a larger arsenal, points with which to upgrade the various units, and new mission types. Zombie incursions increase in size and difficulty in discrete stages.\n\nIs it playable? (Barely/Mostly/Completely)\nCompletely.\n\nBugs?\nNone.\n\nUser Interface?\nEasy to use and straightforward.\n\nHow good is it? (Terrible/Bad/0k/Good/Great)\nGood\n\nAudio?\nSatisfactory explosions, gunfire, sirens, etc. The music had a generally Latin feel. The audio enhanced the gaming experience.\n\nVisuals?\nColorful art style. Comic-style drawings used to help convey story points. Game map visually basic, with zombies and units represented simply for maximum visibility. Not visually impressive.\n\nStory?\nBarely there. Your Mileage May Very whether that's a good or bad thing. Personally, I think zombie stories are usually silly, and so the lack of a more substantial treatment is no big loss and even opened room for player-driven narrative stemming from mechanical interaction during missions. Zombies happen. You defend against them and eventually destroy them entirely. 20 lines of story.\n\nMechanics?\nSolid and varied enough for several hours of fun. Sometimes the random selection of units made available in the vanilla game proved frustrating, as it is impossible to win with some combinations. On the other hand, playing with certain of the non-vanilla boxes ticked made the game much too easy (especially the ability to select whichever units you want for every mission).\n\nVerdict:\nRecommend","November 28, 2015","true","25.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Zombies are invading the 1960s city of Nuevos Aires, and you are tasked with evacuating the populace from each district from your orbital platform.\n\nEach month, you can take on one mission and try to rescue as many civilians as possible.  Everything is procedurally generated, from the city limits to the levels to even the names of your mercenary squadrons.\n\nThe city grid is full of little yellow cubes, which represent citizens.  Zombies will come pouring in from side streets in a wave of purple cubes.  If they touch a citizen, it will instantly be turned.  A sure-fire victory can be instantly turned to defeat by one lone zed wandering into a clump of defenseless people.  You’ll need to mitigate this risk by carefully deploying and directing your troops.\n\nAs the game goes on, you’ll receive new and interesting units to deploy, though you’ll only get a random assortment of them each round.  This keeps things challenging, as you can’t take on a completely infested level with just a single mortar.  You’ll need to decide each round how hard of a level you think you can complete with your ever-changing arsenal.  Your different units can level up and improve their capabilities, and you can even recruit scientists to give you some bonus powers.  The Llama bombs are especially game-changing.   You only have a set time to evacuate citizens before night falls and zeds come pouring in from every angle, almost ensuring any remaining citizens will die.  This puts a soft cap on the length of time a level can take; most will last 3 minutes or less.\n\nLet’s talk about that music!  A handful of upbeat, cheerful tracks of what I would term “Beach Rock” add a layer of dissonance to the disturbing proceedings taking place below.  Jamming guitars and pounding drums make you so happy to be mowing down zombies and abandoning people to die just so you can save a few others!  But its OK, you’ll say, because they’re just cubes anyway.  They turn purple.  That’s a nice color.\n\nThe campaign mode offers a big list of customization options so you can set it to be as hard or as breezy as you’d like.  You can also remove some of the randomization and select your squads at the beginning of each month, which is a feature I really liked.  Oh, and there’s also a set of backstory vignettes you can collect to tell you about the history of Nuevos Aires and how the outbreak occurred.\n\nAtom Zombie Smasher is a weird, cheerful, bright zombie-slaying game.  Sometimes you just need to rescue some little cubes from certain death, blowing up other cubes to buy some time.  AZS lets you do that to a totally rad soundtrack.","December 13, 2015","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
