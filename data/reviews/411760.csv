In Swordbreaker you can do exactly that!\n\nThis very basic, russian fantasy Visual novel, let´s you as adventurer explore one deadly castle on the search for the ultimate treasure.\nWhile the story is not really impressive, you have some different routes you can follow and three kind of choices for the persons you encounter  (cowardly, hero like and aggressive).\nFrom over 300 scenes, there are over 100 death scenes, so one can imagine, that death really comes swiftly here.\n\nYou have three lives per playthrough and the end also is relating to the kind of decisions you have mostly chosen.\n\nOne playthrough doesn´t take that long, and as to be expected, the scenes repeat themselves after some time, but the graphic is well done, and the music is ok too. This with some (weird) humor, makes up for an enjoyable, if short story.\n\nConclusio: Swordbreaker is a nice VN snack, for fans. What you get is ok for the price it is offered for and fun enough for a few playthroughs. Completionists also have quite some achievements and extra gallery art to unlock. Some kinda crude translations add to the very special charme ..

It was pretty awesome and was filled with an immense amount of content but you really have to work for it! There are literally hundreds or options, paths and story conclusions you can pursue as your journey unfolds. The graphics and translations are good and nothing prevented me from enjoying this title. It does start in Russian but can be changed easily... so don't stress.\n\nI wouldn't really classify this as a visual novel; there is no linear progression in the traditional sense and gameplay makes it difficult to create a fluid experience. I found that each session would last about 15 minutes; I would then make bad decisions, die and have to start from the beginning. This is where I start to get antsy and want to give up on the game in general. In order to advance in the story you will end up playing the first few stages 50+ times in order to pursue different paths in the story. That alone prevents me from loving this title.\n\nWorth the $3; a solid game with a hardcore emphasis on choices matter.\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

You play as a nameless adventurer who goes by the title Swordbreaker. After an evening at the pub, the weary adventurer witnesses a murder. The killer escapes, yet the dying victim hands Swordbreaker an old map before sputtering his last. The map leads to an ancient castle, packed with a limitless supply of treasure! Like most adventurers would, Swordbreaker sets off on a journey that’ll put his skills to the test, and change his life forever.\n\nThe entirety of the game takes place in this castle, and it’s got to be the most bazare castle ever portrayed in gaming. Just about anything you can think of dwells here; Giant arachnids, aliens, ghosts, orcs, killer squids, warlocks, princesses, zombies, skeletons and so much more. There are over 300 different scenarios to encounter throughout the castle, all of which result in different outcomes. It’s addictive as hell, and each new playthrough will unveil new fights, encounters and choices.\n\nBut, this game’s true saving grace is the artwork. Every single picture, from the most mundane death to a breath-taking fight sequence, throbs with detail. Creatures look frightening and the castle’s twisted interior will make any adventurer soil themselves. The amount of effort and dedication put into this art is unfathomable.\n\nApart from its random story and breathtaking visuals, it’s hard to believe how much replay value Swordbreaker contains. With hundreds of different encounters and possible ways to die, topped off with over 60 achievements, you’ll be surviving this game’s brutality for quite a few hours. Just playing through once would be a huge disservice to what Swordbreaker achieves.\n\nTranslation from Russian to English is fine, and it won’t be the most enticing thing you’ll ever read, but it gets the job done. Sadly, it’s Swordbreaker’s pure reliance on luck that irritates me. Almost every decision made can get you killed, and to survive… well, you’ve just gotta hope for the best. You’re normally given two or three different options to make during scenarios, and it’s never clear which one will keep you alive. You’ve got three lives, and once they’re all depleted, you restart from the beginning. It can be pretty aggravating at times, especially when the game cheats you during a climactic boss fight, but with Swordbreaker’s endless amount of replayability, I’d say that makes up for it.\n\nIt’s cheap, it's innocent, and it’ll make for a fun pastime. I see no reason to miss out on something as cool as Swordbreaker.","December 20, 2015","true","1.9"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

Are you a fan of choose your own adventure books? Are you a fan of fantasy settings? If you answered yes to all three then chances are you will find what DuCats Game Studio have presented here appealing. Bonus points if you like earning quick and easy Steam achievements. Swordbreaker the Game. The game definitely reminds me of the old fantasy adventure choose your own adventure books that I loved so dearly as a child but whose adult texts were often aimed at people several years older than I was (I began reading these books at about the age of ten). Regardless, it was an experience that I was more than willing to take on. It certainly proved to be a different type of visual novel than the largely Asian variety that has come to be popular on Steam. Not that there’s anything wrong with them just that there is a notable difference.\n\nOne critique that I will offer DuCats is to please make English your default language in your next game. I am certain that you will find that a greater percentage of Russians are at least somewhat knowledgeable about the English language than you will find native English speakers who can read Russian. Starting the game to Russian text and subtitles proved to be a disorienting experience. In fact, I accidentally closed the game and looked for the language settings in the out of game options menu, which was set to English, before heading to the Steam discussion forums to find that the simple answer was to click the ‘Eng’ button on the bottom left hand corner of the main menu.\n\nThe achievements come quick and fast as do the deaths. Take a wrong option and you can kiss goodbye to that life. Thankfully, you do have three of them. I would have liked to have had a better idea of what was going to happen next as some of the options felt as though they very easily could have gone the other way or that they should have. However, arguably that’s something that constitutes a good story – you should never know what is going to come next even if some of the deaths felt a little cheap. It’s more than a little unfortunate that you have to start over once you have lost that third and final life but there are so many different angles to take – some of which have multiple successful (as in you will not die) to move the story in different directions.\n\nThe art work is beautiful. The artists are masters in their field. If I could I would simply scroll through the different images in this game and enjoy them without having to play the game they are that good. It’s different than the usual type that you’ll find in visual novels and gives helps the game its distinct taste and flavor. The music was suitable for the game although I believe that some would find it grating and repetitive.  The game is technically sound and plays very well. There’s not much to critique from that perspective at all.\n\nI would definitely recommend Swordbreaker the Game to old school adventure game fans – whether that be by book or by video gaming. There’s a lot to like here. There is definite value for money with this title.","January 8","true","9.5"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

A nameless adventurer traveling through this mysterious castle when I come upon a classroom. Intertesting I think to myself, and hey there is a note from a previous student. it reads " The black tiles are rigged with land mines." I think to myself damn what a close call I'm glad I read that note. Hey there is another note the first was so helpful I better read this too! (my last thought before I lay dead. A mysterious adventurer in a mysterious castle!\n\nOkay for the review... Let me start off by saying usually what I spend on\na game is roughly the amount of hours of enjoyment I expect to get out\nof a game. (there are exceptions of course, but in this case a $3 game,\nand I got well over 10 hours of enjoyment.) You could easily play through\nthis a few times in a couple hours, but I left no stone untouched through my journey(s)\nin the mysterious tale(s) of Swordbreaker. You are a nameless adventurer traversing\nthrough a haunted castle in searce of riches, and glory. So now I'll get to the point:\n\nPros for me -\n1. Plenty of paths to get a good amount of play time for the money spent.\n2. Perfect for an hour, or two, or if you only have a couple minutes to play.\n3. Cool comic book like graphics/art I really enjoyed it, and thought it set the theme well.\n4. Plenty of achievements for the achievement perfectionists out there.\n5. Cards\n6. I read in several topics where the dev was always willing to help people\nin need of technical, and gameplay help. (I got some help with my last\ncouple scenes from the dev myself) I love to see a smaller dev, so dedicated\nto not only thier work, but also thier fan base. I am extremely impressed by how\nthey stand by this game.\n\nNegative -\n1. The only real thing that's negative imo is occasionally the english translations are\na little poor. Not so bad where you can't catch where the story is trying to taking you it's\njust a strange way of wording things etc, but by no means does it take from the story.\n\nI really can't recommend Swordbreaker enough. The stories are fun, and interesting. A lot\nof times comical. If you enjoy choose your own adventures, or games that aren't going to\ntake up hours of your time in a sitting then I think you will really enjoy this game. I am really\nlooking forward to seeing what Ducat brings to the table in the future.","January 3","true","15.4"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

The artwork is stellar, while accompanied with some pretty good music. If you like these kind of games I highly recommend it (especially for such a low price). But keep in mind that this game is very short, if you just want to reach the end.\n\nYou play as an adventurer who sets out on a quest for some kind of great treasure in an old castle. The game lets you make choices. Some of these choices count towards one of three "Paths": The coward, hero or killer. These will eventually lead to three different endings. The artwork sometimes gives you hints to what you need to do to survive a specific situation. For example, you come into a hallway with corpses on the ground. You get the choice to run through the hallway or to crawl. When you look at the artwork you see a gaps in the wall, suggesting that you need to crawl because the gaps might contain blades that come out when passing through the hallway.\n\nThe game doesn't have many flaws. One of them is that the intro is narated, but the subtitles don't correspond to the narration. Another is that some paths lead to the same room. Sometimes the dialogue suggest that you came from one of the two paths, while you actually came from the other and thus it doesn't correspond to your current playthrough. This happens for example while doing a task for the cook.\n\nThese are very minor flaws in a great game. I look forward to what DuCats has in store next. If you are new to this genre, but find hero of kendrickstone to big to be your first game in the genre, this will be right game for you. Or even if you just want something else than a fps or an open world game.","February 3","true","5.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/recommended/411760/","pepsimanvsjoe","pepsimanvsjoe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/","1281 products in account","When I was younger, "Choose your own Adventure" books were a great source of entertainment. The stories probably weren't particularly great, but the endings always were. While there were always a few good endings - the kind where the protagonist saves the day/gets the girl/becomes a billionaire - most of the time he (or she) was killed. I call it one of the benefits of growing up in the 80s. Not only did your parents take you to see Robocop, but you also got to read books, where the authors thought up dozens of brutal and hilarious deaths for the main character. After playing through Swordbreaker, I'm feeling the urge to buy up a load of Edward Packard books.\n\nAs the titular Swordbreaker, you'll enter a giant castle in the search of the greatest treasure. There's not much to say about the hero except that he reminds me of Dirk the Daring. What? You've never heard of Dragon's Lair? Well, just picture a hapless shmuck with a sword. As the player, you must lead Swordbreaker through the castle to his ultimate fate. Will you obtain the incredible treasure? Or will you suffer over 100 untimely deaths? Hmm..I guess you'll have to find that out on your own.\n\nThe game begins with you outside of the castle. At every point, there are at least two decisions you can make. Sometimes these decisions lead to alternate routes, or they just lead to death. You get three lives and then you have to start over. This is done to encourage replay-value. The decisions are never changed or randomized in anyway, so as long as your memory is sound, you'll eventually make it through the castle. That said, it's worth taking the time to try everything, even if death is guaranteed. Some of the ways the hero meets his end are flat-out hilarious. They're not as imaginative as the stories I read growing up, but they're all illustrated and definitely brutal.\n\nAlong the way you'll meet other characters. In these situations, you can choose to help them, kill them, or run away. This morality system determines the "good" ending you can receive. By "good" I mean an ending where you aren't viciously massacred in a humiliating fashion. You'll see what I mean if you pick this game up. The number of times the hero dies by tripping and falling is ridiculous. If he can't handle walking and running, maybe he shouldn't be an adventurer. Thankfully, these constant deaths are balanced out, by the fact that getting back to where you ran out of lives, only takes a minute or two.\n\nOnce you've seen everything in this game, there's little reason to go back. Looking through the gallery is nice, but you can't expect anything in the way of replay-value. It takes a few hours to unlock most if not all of the scenes. Considering that the game is priced at $3, I think it's a fair value. If you're a completionist, getting the few remaining scenes can be frustrating. There is a map of the castle that tracks every scene, but it doesn't tell you how to reach every area. It might be worth the effort to jot down a few notes. The only other complaint is that the music gets old very quickly. On the bright side, I can catch up on my music backlog.\n\nThere's only so much I can say about Swordbreaker without resorting to spoilers. If the concept interests you, then give it a look. You may discover that it isn't a terrible way to spend an afternoon or two.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","November 10, 2015","true","4.7"," 21 of 36 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","21","36","2","0"

In fact, the game starts in Russian!!\n\nIt's easy enough to change it to English, but from there it just get better.\n\nSkeleton Warriors\nToothless Hell Dogs\nGiant Octupi\nAliens\nNUCLEAR WARHEADS!\n\nIt just goes on and on. I reccomend it because it's a fun choose your own adventure with tons of branching paths and deaths to find. Plus, achievements and cards.\n\nAnd...\n\nNUCLEAR. WARHEADS. Fashioned by a BLACKSMITH.\n\nThis game is as Russian as it gets.","January 14","true","5.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Well Wrought achievents, had alot of fun replaying all the paths for 100% English translation a bit wonky with some thesaurical errors but most are more amusing than ambiguous, well worth the meager price its offerd for, Would play more like this.

That said, the different ways you can meet your demise on this game do make you want to keep replaying and making different choices, just so you can see all of the different possible outcomes.\n\nTbf, £2 would probably be far less than what you might pay for a comic with this much artwork, so I don't think you're being  hard done by when buying this game. Although you would expect a game to provide more play time usually, this is a pretty cheap game, and is still worth the money.\n\nIt is an interesting and enjoyable world that the game is set in. I found it entertaining, and so would recommend this game if you have the spare change burning a hole in your pocket.","May 15","true","1.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

So...Good interactive comic game! Really like that one. So far only 0.2 hours played and I am pretty sure I'll keep dying but I'll finish it!\n\n+Really good music(one thing - some tracks has low bitrate, which saddens me((()\n+Interresting story so far! ATM that big octo 've eaten me.\n+It is not linear so far!\n\n-Low bitrate of battle\dying tracks\n-it is not always comfortable to scroll down the text and go up and press the choice button.\nUPD\nMy bad. I can scroll not only over the text, but anywhere, so...it's OK.\n\nOverall:\nStrongly recommended for all who loves interactive comic books with non-linear story. Good art, good music, good story.\n\nUPD\nНу чо...вот и первое прохождение.\n069\324\n013\124\n\nГерой!\n\nПогнали дальше!","November 6, 2015","true","1.3"," 12 of 25 people (48%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","48","12","25","3","4"

The cowards path is saying you will help then ditching the person if you just help the alien guy it still counts as coward path as you meet a sponge guy who wants to be friendly and was a coward in the real world and you live with him in the castle you buy.","November 25, 2015","true","1.4"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"
