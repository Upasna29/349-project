The arenas are also partly a maze, useful for the other three game modes – swag-bag, fire-tag and smash-and-grab. Random cards appear for players to collect and use on command, allowing some control over which gametypes get played – and variant rules. These apply tweaks to the current game, spanning from the mundane of score adjustments to the game-mechanic altering of tag-teams. Keeping a sense of awareness is necessary at all times – if other players are getting involved in brawls then switching to a race may help you gain more points; if another player has the swag-bag then dropping the scoring will cut their advantage, and so on.The game can be played with two people, but this feels quite empty – the arenas are sized for more, and the intended frenzy of changing game-types slows to one-on-one contests, with controls intended for big moves more than focused duels. The lack of precise animation and fine combat are less critical when trying to double-jump to safety with the swag-bag from three other, brawling competitors, but will stand out more when there's less distraction and more desire for skill to overcome an equal opponent.There is also a single player challenge mode. As it currently stands it is little more than a tutorial for basic controls, although has the potential to expand into something revealing deeper uses of game mechanics.However, Overruled! is a multiplayer game to its core, and if you can play against three other people you should find yourself having an enjoyable, chaotic time.","November 16, 2014","true","5.3"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","16","22","0","2"

Since the day I saw it at a games convention I kept going back to this one. It has a really unique art style and gameplay and for early access it has so much content. Since there are cards the game can change at any moment at one point you can be winning then the next minute your coming last. There is also a nice vary in map (with hopefully more to come) and a campain mode which is still being worked on.

There are cards that change the rules at any time, which could help with timing in respawning, timing for your projectile weapon, or the amount of points possible, or the very game themselves.\n\nThe rule is simple - get as much points as possible, but how you get those points (and how much) depends entirely on the rules randomized every 30 seconds (or presented by a fellow player)\n\nBut at one point during the game, you have an "OVERRULED" card which negates any card presented on the table, so it's a game of juggling not only the platforming and combat, but the very rules and scoring themselves.\n\nPlay according to your skill set, or hinder your opponents on their best skill set. It's a very addictive game, and can't wait to see new levels, new characters and possibly more "twists" as the game continues.","August 14, 2014","true","1.2"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","13","19","0","0"

The rule changing mechanics are a really nice idea. Recommended specially if you have firends/family to play locally with.\nTLDR: Keep in mind that this is an early review. There are many things the devs are working on.\n\nControls: Controller works GREAT. It feels fluid and intuitive, you won't catch yourself having a hard time switching cards, jumping and hitting someone at the same time. On the other hand, keyboard controls feel plain out weird, specially on the card-controlling part (controlled using u, i, o, j, k, l). My first games were played using this imput method and it could sometimes get frustrating. This point is further aggravated by the fact that there are no remapping options at this point.\n\nGameplay: This is the strongest point of this game. It is a 2D brawler with constantly changing rules (tag, king of the hill, racing, FFA and more), which are twisted further by players constantly playing their cards to, for example, double the points given or disable melee attacks for some time. 4 player games can get insanely fun, specially (as I already mentioned) in local games.\n\nCommunity: Right now the community is pretty small, and it can take some time to find a match to play in online. This can get frustrating at times, especially if you experience the "UPNP router bug" which won't let you create a lobby (which the game will automatically will do if it can't find a situable match, forcing you to lose even more time as it can't be cancelled until the error shows up).\n\nOverall: The game is fun, but does not feel complete yet. If the genre draws you in and you don't mind encountering a few bugs along the way, you will surely have a nice time playing. The devs are active in the forums and the community seems to be growing in a by-day basis, so even with its current flaws, I recommend this game.","August 17, 2014","true","1.3"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

The basic combat is a bit sluggish, predictable and limited. The trailer makes the changes in game modes seem much more dynamic than they actually are. Basically you get things like collect coins, deathmatch, king of the hill and capture the flag, none of these are terribley exciting.\n\nIt is worth noting that it is still in open Beta. However the core mechanics of the game seem to be a bit limiting and I'm not sure how likely this is to change.\n\nIts not too bad to play a few rounds here and there, but the price tag is a bit much.

Call it synchronicity or serendipitous or whatever, I'm glad I found it. In our game (Gem Wars: Attack of the Jiblets) we have a "Mixed Mode" where the game mode changes periodically, in this game the game mode is in constant flux as part of the gameplay. It's all very interesting and very fun.\n\nWe'll be in direct competition or we'll share the market-- either way, I can't deny it, I love Overruled. :)\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=397397412","March 15, 2015","true","2.2"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"
