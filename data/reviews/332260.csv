For example, the game likes to crash for random periods, and the longest I've gone without crashing is 20 minutes.  Then again, it might just be my computer.  Now, for the review:\n\nStory: Think the first Cars Game, then mix it with the aftermath of Cars 2.\n\nHub: Ripped from the first game, with the additon of a redesigned O.V\n\nControls: I suggest a gamepad for playing this.\n\nGraphics: Very Good, but odd.  For example: High Poly models, but low reseloution textures.\n\nMusic: Also from the first game.  That menu music is still "driving" me crazy.  Some songs are from the film, such as "Life Is A Highway."\n\nScore: 8/10\n\nGreat for the kids, or for teenagers and adults looking for a nostaglia trip.  Just don't expect to get very far using modern systems and keyboard controls.  But that is just my opinon.","February 25, 2015","true","3.2"," 29 of 39 people (74%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","74","29","39","13","0"

It runs at 60fps(unlike the orginal), and it features much higher quality textures. The racing is fun and the open hub world is great to have. This is like an expansion on the first game that makes the original almost useless. Then there is modding, but I will get to that. That gets me to the problems that do not make sense...\nFirst it does not support 1080p(The 1st did) on my screen, however my laptop runs at 1080 fine,and the 360 rotation is terribly touchy. As for the graphics options there are not any really. Typical Disney port. Though you would really need a paper weight to struggle running this. Then theres a little known glitch where if you're running it off of fast HDD hybrid(32+GB cache) the sound will glitch and the game will freeze for a half second to catch up. So run this off of a slower hybird, normal HDD, or SSD. I am running it on an SSD and it runs great. On top of that Chick Hicks is gone, among others from the movie like DJ and King. That gets me to best thing about this game.\nA mod called High Octaine. It puts all the big characters in this and adds many new tracks. You can pick Snot Rod, Cartrip, Wingo, Lizzy,and Fred. Freaking Fred! And many more. It even adds McQueen and Matrer from Matters Tall Tales as well as Mia and Tia wearing different costumes from Tall Tales. I have yet to get a crash and everythings buttery smooth even though it is not widescreen. If you go to your graphic control pannel you can increase and enhance everything; so don't be afraid of messing around with things like texture qulity and set AF x16. Like wise Sweet Fx works great enhancing the draw distance, lighting and colors. Go to Nexus and download Sweet Fx mod for Assassins Creed Rouge and drop it in with the exe. Its a great preset and doesn't require any tweeking if you don't want to. With all that in place it is the most visually impressive Cars game anywhere with the most content.\nIf your kids like Cars, then this is the version to get on PC hands down. None of the mods take much work and the game runs very well.","December 23, 2015","true","6.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","1"
