"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/recommended/268540/","Faudraline","Faudraline","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/","1196 products in account",""I should have fed him in time..."\n\nThe Whispered World is one of Daedalic Entertaintment's adventure titles, and promises a lot as it starts, yet fails to keep any of those promises throughout the game itself. I wasn't expecting an experience as grand as Memoria, but at least hoping for the kind of quality in story and display of beauty as we encountered in Chains of Satinav. What I encountered, was beautiful potential spent badly on a sad little clown.\n\nThe storybook opens and a worn-out narrator warns us that this will be the last story that he'll be telling ever. Then, we meet Sadwick: the sad little clown. He is a misanthropic, pessimistic and annoying little boy who runs a circus alongside his brother Ben and his grandfather. One morning, Sadwick jumps down from his bed, shaken and terrified of a nightmare that indicates the world is ending. Oh, wait! According to a messenger of the King that Sadwick will be meeting in the forest, the world IS ending for reasons that we are not aware yet. The messenger Bobby advices Sadwick to seek Shana, a mythical oracle that resides in the forest who can interpret Sadwick's dream. With a quest at hand, Sadwick's journey towards the unknown starts...\n\nI'll start with my most basic complaint: the game doesn't work properly! There is an odd clicking bug that starts the minute you run the game, and keeps haunting you until the very end. You have to click on something 5-6 times for the game to acknowledge that you are clicking on it. It is hellishly annoying for a POINT AND CLICK adventure game. The puzzles themselves are obscure and random enough, and you never know whether you're trying the wrong item combination, or just game doesn't register your clicking. On that manner, it is impossible to finish the game without divine persistency and a walkthrough.\n\nThe background art and the interface music are pretty, as if taken from a German folktale. But characters and the style of art chosen to illustrate them are off putting. Animations are broken half the time, and the lip synch with the audio is non-existent. It takes forever for Sadwick to walk with the given animation. It seems all these issues are commonly known for the "Special Edition" and no solution has been offered for now.\n\nAs a character, our protagonist Sadwick is incredibly annoying and lacks personal depth. His voice is off putting - and drives you insane since we'll be with him only until the end of game. There is no logical correlation between story progression and any kind of visible personal growth either. Nothing justifies his choices, and nothing explains them either. There is also no observable reason to Sadwick's endless vailing or suffocating pessimism to begin with. Sadwick is a character which is impossible to empathize with. He is basically shallow.\n\nAs for Spot's - Sadwick's victimized caterpillar - transformations and the way that Sadwick treats him, I found it to be disgusting. Poor little thing is literally tortured to even achieve given transformations! He is sliced, pressed and burned numerous times without even a single complain! He is even nailed to a rack as part of a puzzle nearing the end of the game. If I were to be Spot, I'd tell Sadwick: "♥♥♥♥ you! ♥♥♥♥ you for being a selfish and miserable fool! ♥♥♥♥ you for putting me through all these ordeals! You don't deserve neither my loyalty nor my affection! I'm done with you, Sadwick! Go play the part of the sadistic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on someone else! ♥♥♥♥ you!” Whew, sorry. I gotta get that off my chest.\n\nI definitely don't recommend this game, for its broken controls, its annoying protagonist, its sick sense of humor, and definitely for its dramatized yet shallow ending. Sorry, guys and gals. I finished this game through sheer willpower and an obsession for completing a story that I started. I love the next Daedalic adventure just as you do, but this one doesn't worth it.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","September 19, 2015","false","11.0"," 81 of 115 people (70%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","70","81","115","6","11"

Why the Devs can't do this for those who aren't familiar with modifying third-party code and compiling from source is beyond me.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/notsue/recommended/268540/","notsue","I'm Not Sue","http://steamcommunity.com/id/notsue/","465 products in account","I found this to be a very charming point-and-click adventure game.  The focus of the story is on a depressive child clown by the name of Sadwick, who departs from his family circus to avert the end of the world from coming to pass.\n\nThe story is more of a whimsical one, but the game is not a comedy and does take itself seriously.  You get a nice amount of character growth from Sadwick and the course of the story has you meet new and interesting characters in each scene along the way.  The amount of depth to each character you meet was pleasantly surprising, and at least a few really made for some happy smile-inducing moments and the German voice acting is quite expressive (see my note below) .  The environments are very beautifully drawn and in-game animations are very good too.  There are some cutscenes which have less polish, looking maybe more like a 90's cartoon but overall did not detract from the experience for me.  The music is quite good, even if some of the tracks are re-used a few too many times.\n\nGame ran just fine, but doesn't alt-tab too well.  Saving, mouse controls, the GUI are all perfectly fine.  The game has no failstates, and you can hold Spacebar to highlight interactables.  This game does have a fair few number of puzzles that are not easy to intuit the solutions for, so you will likely have to resort to a guide more often than you'd like.  This is par for the course in adventure games, although the par is a bit high in this game.\n\n\nI also wanted to address a few complaints I saw a lot in other people's reviews.\n\nPerformance : Many users complained of the game failing to launch, launching to a black screen, or crashing.  I never once had any such issue.  I hope others who do are able to resolve theirs.\n\nSadwick's walking speed : Some users complained that Sadwick walks too slow.  In most adventure games you can double-click on screen transitions to automatically trigger them.  You can do that in this game too, so its possible those users did not know.  Sadwick walks at a fine pace otherwise, no scene is especially large bar one and even then the transitions in that area are numerous.\n\nVoice acting : I heard that the English dub VA for Sadwick is unbearable and whiny.  Given his personality in the game I could see why this might be, so I used the original German voice acting and enjoyed it thoroughly.  I have no problems with using the German VA.\n\nBroken audio : Some users comment that audio seems to cut off abruptly at the end of some spoken lines.  I cannot comment on the English audio, but this is sometimes noticeable in the German audio. I did not find it common enough nor disruptive enough to say it was any significant detriment, although the developers should fix it if so.\n\nControls : Some users complain the game fails to register mouse clicks.  I never had this happen, but you do have to hold down the mouse button to open the small interaction menu.\n\nStory : Some people just don't like the premise or character personality, or how the game ends.  That's fine, its just down to taste.  I enjoyed it, others will not.\n\n\nAll in all, I would recommend it.  I very much enjoyed myself.  About 10-12 hrs playtime.","August 18, 2015","true","12.4"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","23","26","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/linibot/recommended/268540/","linibot","Lin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/linibot/","556 products in account","tl;dr: Some really fantastic artwork and an interesting world with fun secondary characters to explore. That aside, this game misses too many marks to be really good, and becomes almost a chore towards the end, mostly due to the old bane of point & clicks: illogical puzzles and rushed final chapters.\n\nIt's a mostly melancholic story with great moments of bleak humour, one that promises to be interesting but loses steam along the way. There is some fun writing to be found in it (I do love me some Talking Rocks and any and all quips they feel like making are fine by me), but the story becomes weirdly convoluted in the last chapter. The world building is fascinating nonetheless, and along with the gorgeous art they are clearly the highlights of the experience. As for the english voice over, it has some bad moments but it's mostly alright. The hero's voice may take some getting used to though.\n\nFor me the major let down is that too many of the puzzles are really unintuitive and illogical, and there is only that much drudgery I'm willing to accept in my play. I don't care if that was fine when Lucas Arts did it, it isn't fine now, especially not if you expect me to traverse multiple screens with a really slow character to try out totally random things that follow no internal logic whatsoever. It gets worse as the chapters progress, and by the last one you'll have too many moments of being hard pressed to figure out what to do next without immense patience or a walkthrough. Any guidance, even subtle indications, would have helped, but they are as lacking as any type of a hint system.\n\nOn a positive note, if you were worried about bugs the "Special Edition" seems to have taken care of most of the previous problems. Just bear in mind that this is an older game so there are limited resolutions offered - expect black bars if you have a wide screen. High DPI displays will also need to disable display scaling to be able to play in fullscreen.\n\nSo would I suggest it?\nProbably not. I'm usually a sucker for projects of love even if they end up being lovable trainwrecks, and this game oozes love for its unlikely world-weary child hero and its odd world. But halfway through it just stopped being fun to actually play, there were one too many misses and not enough hits. While I don't regret the time I spent with it, I still can't recommend it and I'd suggest waiting for a steep discount if you decide to try it yourself.","September 8, 2015","false","9.7"," 26 of 36 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","26","36","0","0"

Pretty much like everything else in my life."\nOne of my most favorite genres is point n' click and Daedalics are THE titans of point and clicks. I learn more about the characters if I explore everything. It takes me a while but I'm in no hurry. After all, that's how point and click should be played. No such thing as speed run. Everytime Daedalics tell a different story that makes me want to stay with characters longer. A pity every story has an end. The day will come when you'll have to bid farewell to your fictional friends.\n\nThis time it's a story about Sadwick the sad clown and Spot the caterpillar - his handsome sidekick and best friend. Sadwick is a lovable character. He's a lovely satirist and a courageous boy. Complains about problems but still tries his best to do everything in his power and can't leave things undone. He's not your casual hero that likes making promises and then break them. He's more like an anti-hero that doesn't care about fame and glory. He just wants to fix the big end-of-the-world problem. The nightmare that he has been having turned out to be a good excuse to start exploring the world. He is very insecure and has anxiety problems so I can relate to him. I wish I were as brave as that kiddo.  Sadwick isn't as stupid and useless as his older brother Ben makes him feel. I've always wanted to punch that guy for bullying Sadwick. I could never forget about the awesome talking rock bros - Ralv and Yngo, that wanted to enslave the world  with a rock hard fist but sadly they couldn't do anything but lie about. Grandpa's underpants are more useful than arrogant Bobby the Chaski. I played it in english and I like Sadwick's voice. Not sure why people think he has an annoying voice. I think it's quite adorable.\nThat game has a deep meaning and I would hate to ruin it with spoilers.\nI just wonder how many of us would like to preserve the world they've been living in without changing anything or whatsoever and for what price.","January 8","true","23.1"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

Unfortunately, zany and surreal adventures invariably involve a certain amount of "try everything on everything" to progress, and this runs afoul of the crappy interface.\n\nFrequently, The Whispered World fails to register a mouse click, so you never know, when trying an object on another, or an object on part of the environment, if it truly did nothing, or if the game simply didn't notice your attempt.  Sometimes it takes four or five clicks to get the game to respond.  After the third time that I gave up on a puzzle, checked a walkthrough, and discovered that the correct solution was, in fact, one of the first things I had tried, except that the game hadn't deigned to notice at the time, I gave the whole thing up as a bad exercise in frustration.\n\nIf you're masochistic enough to endure this game, make a point of clicking several times when trying anything; hopefully one of the clicks will register.  The art, incidentally, is quite beautiful, it's simply a shame what aggravating hoops you must jump through to see it.\n\n(And, yes, my mouse works fine in all other applications, so I feel confident blaming the game engine for this non-responsiveness.)","June 22, 2014","false","1.3"," 30 of 45 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","30","45","0","0"

Most of the puzzles are badly designed. Why, you would ask? I've got a feeling that most of them (and their results) were planned before the actual script and the developers shoveled them afterwards, not caring that they make absolutely no God damned sense. Some people mentioned it already, but let me repeat after them. Some actions needed to be taken are plainly illogical and there's no chance I would thought of them before reading a solution. Maybe it comes from the fact, that people responsible for the puzzles needed this action but for the next puzzle which is unbeatable before taking said illogical actions. Eg. aquiring the five balls Spot's form is absurd, but you need this form in order to progress in the birds puzzle. But how do I know I need to have this exact Spot's form to pull it further? I do not know of course, because I didn't know this form exists and what for it would be needed. In order to be aware that there's a possibility of aquiring a new Spot's form I need to know how the bird puzzle is designed to be solved... But I do not know that from obvious viscious circle of this certain situation. The action taken to aquire the five balls Spot is just absurd itself! This machine would have killed everyone and there's no way I would sanely put anything living there. All in all, puzzles (except the minigames which are fine) are subpar, often illogical and irritiating. Other Daedalic games did much better work at this.\nThis brings us to the next hit'n'miss aspect of the game: characters. Most of them are really extraordinary and interesting, like the Rocks or the dwarf responsible for the train. Some quite funny lines happen there as well. But the main protagonist is just a mess. A lously clown, depressed and cynical, a person with an obvious death wish, with a clear friendship towards his pet. He often screams in horror "Spot, are you all right?!". But then he throws Spot to the machines that would clearly kill it, in order to aquire its new forms that are illogicaly needed in some puzzles. I mean, how more interesting to the birds are five little Spots than fire Spot? Oh wait, this puzzle's outcome was clearly designed without the thought of integrity with steps needed to progress it. Also, like someone said already, Sadwick is a clumsy fellow, but yet he success in everything he does in the first try. If you design your main character, stick to the core God dammit.\nThe game sometimes has problems with telling us what's our next goal, throwing us to the curse of point'n'clicks: click ♥♥♥♥♥♥ everything you can, hoping that something moves on.\n\nWhy do I recommend this game then?

Whispered World is probably not the greatest game released by Daedalic Entertainment, but if you like stories which set up everything for the last five minutes, then it’s a must-have.\n\nLong version:The Whispered World is an interesting specimen. At first it seems like a usual old-style point ‘n’ click adventure, where the plot is large suppressed by the depressingly pessimistic attitude of the protagonist. On top of that, the story introduces a lot of seemingly unconnected and strange elements at every turn, which usually don’t lead anywhere in particular. Until you get to the very end and realise Whispered World is like movies such as Usual Suspects or Sixth Sense: everything was just a very long setup for the final huge twist.\nIs it a good twist at least? It’s hard to tell. To some degree it’s predictable and clichéd. On the other hand it is a bittersweet ending that fits the overall tone.\n\nThe seemingly unconnected aspects of the plot translate into a fairly challenging puzzle system, where the role of items and hotspots are not always (or always not) obvious. This leads to a fair share of trial and error scenarios, especially in the last third the story, where everything gets increasingly surreal.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, the game has a few problems, like disturbingly choppy animations and sluggish, somewhat unresponsive controls. Many people also suffer from audio sync problems. These shortcomings won’t make it unplayable, but they may result in some unneeded frustration that could have been averted with a little more care.","April 6, 2015","true","9.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

He's not just any clown. He's a clown with no talents. He's scared and uncertain about what to do with his life. The game goes on to talk about his story and how he "save" his world.\n\nAside from the story, I like the music and character voices. Sadwick's voice sounds like a person talking with a running nose and has the flu, but it fits with his personality. Furthermore, this is not just a simple point & click game. There are short animation clips that added to the storyline and makes the characters feel real.\n\nHowever, this Special Edition has problems with mouse clicks and animation & video syncing. For example, when trying to click somewhere on the screen, there are instances where the mouse click would not register. Furthermore, some animation clips had voices that did not match the video animations. Besides these few mishaps, The Whispered World Special Edition is a fun and short little game!\n\nRating: 6.2/10 (62%)\nAchievements: 10/20 (50%)\nGame Done.","January 2, 2015","true","7.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

And The Whispered World: Special Edition doesn't disappoint in the eyes of fans.\nI have to be honest with you, I've encountered none of the problems reported by the earlier reviewers. I don't know whether they have been patched or not by this time, but my experience in the game leads me to believe that they have been.\n\nIn this game, we follow the journey of Sadwick, a want-to-be hero with clinical depression, who discovers that he has been fated to destroy the world. As you can imagine, he rejects this prophesy, determined instead to save the world from crumbling to dust. Sadwick is a clown in the fantastical realm of Silentia, where he travels with a circus featuring only his brother, his grandfather, and himself. His life consists only of menial chores, burping the alphabet for audiences, and playing the cannonball in the headlining human cannonball act. His brother despises him and his senile grandfather forgets he exists. So yeah, he's a pretty lonely and depressive character. The game is full of dark jokes like "This statue ain't moving. Pretty much like everything else in my life." which is pretty funny and emotional at the same time. You will find yourself asking a lot of times if you should cry of laughter or maybe of sadness. Also, Spot, the caterpillar, is his handsome sidekick and the only friend he has, but they are a great team together. The main character complains about a lot of problems but he tries to do everything in his power to don't leave things undone. He's not your casual hero that likes making promises and breaking them after. He doesn't care about fame and glory. He just wants to fix the big end of the world problem. The nightmares that he has been having turnes out to be a good excuse to start exploring the world in which he lives. So that's how his adventure begins.\n\nThe world created by the developers is vibrant, creative and beautifully brought to life through the eyes of Sadwick. And while many complain that the ending was awful, the story really got into me and let me tell you that it will have a very emotional impact on you too. Like any Daedalic Entertainment game would do.\n\nPros- The story is fantastic and quite emotional with an great impactful ending.\n- Absolutely stunning hand-drawn artwork!\n- Excellent soundtrack that should get you excited for the fantastical adventure that follows.\n- Over 10 hours of story-driven atmosphere!\n- Developer commentary on each and every screen in the game you can listen to, that offers great insights into the art direction, story, and puzzle design, with a few puzzle solutions spoiled. Or stories and memories from the development process if you are interested about how the game was done.\n\nCons- No widescreen support even though it's special edition.\n- Many illogical and obtuse puzzles. A couple of puzzles make no sense until after you’ve figured them out by accident. So don't be ashamed, open a handy walkthrough for occasional use and enjoy the beautifully told and realized story!\n- Sadwick’s voice takes some time getting used to, and the voices are sometimes interrupted with a second before finishing the sentence.\n- Some of the dialogue and humor feel awkward.\n\nConclusionSadwick is a lovable character. He's a lovely sarcastic and courageous boy with a bipolar side. Like any kid, he's confused about a lot of things, he's very insecure and has anxiety problems which will let many people relate to him. This game is a nice portal to our childhood and I'm sure you'll find yourself a lot of times in the main character. The story is suitable for just about everyone, so you can play it with your kid if you want to. In the end, how much you enjoy this game will be particularly subjective, depending on what you look for in an adventure game. If you’re willing to tolerate some ludicrous puzzles to enjoy a beautiful world with gorgeous, top notch art and music, you’ll find The Whispered World worthwhile.\n\nThis review is a part of Steamified's Community Reviews program and the credit goes to both Steamified and Daedalic Entertainment for providing the key for review purposes.For similar Steamified Reviews and Giveaways, please visit http://www.steamified.com/.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bozfoogle/recommended/268540/","bozfoogle","Erroneous Bosch","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bozfoogle/","409 products in account","Before I begin in earnest, I'll give this caveat: It is absolutely imperative that you turn off the audio for the dialogue in this game. The person they employed to voice the protagonist delivers, bar none, the absolute worst performance I have ever experienced in a game within this or any other genre. It's not just a case of it being weird or unconvincing (though make no mistake - it is both weird and unconvincing) - it's a case of it actually inducing physical pain via headaches. It is whiny, grating, nasal, and draws out every vowel for about twice as long as it should. It is Woody Allen mach 10. It is so unbelievably terrible that it took me four years between buying the game when it first came out and finishing it today, as in my first play session I found Sadwick's voice so utterly loathsome that I uninstalled the game and forgot it even existed until the Special Edition popped up in my library out of leftfield.\n\nSo, with that said, is the game worth playing? The answer to this question is a heavily qualified 'yes'. The hype that built up around The Whispered World in the lead-up to its release was, in my estimation, completely unmerited, but it's a good enough game.\n\nMuch has been made of the lack of logic in the game's puzzles, though in my experience only a half dozen or so had a 'How in God's name did they expect me to know that?' solution. While moments like this are infuriating and speak to anachronistic game design, if you're prepared to just consult a walkthrough when you're hopelessly stuck, attribute the momentary catapults into the sky of stupidity to infrequent acid flashbacks on the designer's behalf, and then just carry on resituated on our beloved terra firma, they're not intolerable. In my estimation most of the puzzles are actually amongst the better within the genre, but some may just have a single step which is complete nonsense, or, worse yet, actively go against what Sadwick intimates you should do with an object in his 'hint' dialogue.\n\nDivorced from the godawful voice acting, the writing is actually pretty decent and on a few, rare occasions genuinely funny. The plot employs a stock standard three act structure (albeit spread over four): get quest, get delayed, complete quest. It brings nothing new to the table in this respect, but it's serviceable.\n\nMy primary criticism of The Whispered World is the world itself. The hand drawn art is certainly pretty, if somewhat lacking in vibrancy, but the world itself is just dead. It's quiet, depopulated, and dull. The Asgil, which are meant to be an impossibly fearsome threat to everything good, are two guys. No more. Two guys - the boss and the bumbling underling. A halfway prepared opposition could take these guys out with slingshots and peas. That would be if the world's regular inhabitants who might form this opposition weren't similarly scarce. Most acts introduce no more than three new characters, whom you never really need to speak to more than twice (albeit at some considerable, and arguably unnecessary length). I didn't really care for the story of this depressive clown prophesied to destroy the world, because it was a world I found impossible to become invested in. It's not so much a world as a series of tableauxs, connected with varying degrees of success. My sole motivation to persevere was to find the next puzzle. And as an addendum, I also found the ending to be a self-consciously sentimental attempt to lend this rather small and unambitious story an unearned sense of epic, emotional gravitas. It's not signposted in any way, and really just feels cheap, but I guess your mileage may vary on this.\n\nIf you're a hardcore adventure game enthusiast, by all means give TWW a shot, but that's really the only audience that would truly enjoy this game, because the state of the genre over the past decade or two has turned us into a rather forgiving lot. I'd advise anyone else to steer well clear.","August 1, 2014","true","11.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

If I had to select Daedalic's masterpiece, however, I think I would select The Whispered World.

The game is not perfect--there are a few places where the plot drags, for example--but overall it is fun and thought-provoking. The puzzles are challenging but fun, and most can be approached very logically. What is truly great about The Whispered World, however, is its mind-blowing ending--really, this game must be played to completion. I can't recommend this game highly enough, especially if you are a fan of point-and-click adventures.\n\nSome people find the voice of the main character Sadwick annoying or even unbearable.

That changed with the release of the Special Edition, and I finally got to accompany Sadwick on his adventure to save/destroy the world. Seeing that I never played the regular edition I can not compare the two, but the special edition seems to add very little. Mostly you have the option to listen to commentaries in every scene by the creators of this game. Graphic is supposed to be upgraded and you now get achievements. I don't know if there is anything more than that. Anyhow, nice to get an updated version now before the release of the next game in the series.\n\nThe game itself is beautifully created in a cartoonish and colorful world, with equally colorful characters. The artwork is magnificent. It is as expected a point & click adventure game of the traditional sort. Familiar to anyone who is familiar with other Daedelic games, and other similar game developers.\n\nThe biggest plus of this game is its story. It is interesting and engaging all the way through with a finish that rivals most great game finishes. All characters are voiced and there is a narrator as well. The narrator does a good job, but some of the other voice actors leaves a lot to be desired. The voice of the protagonist, Sadwick, sounds like when Adam Sandler speaks childish somewhat crossed with Cartman from South Park. In other words it can be quite annoying at times. It doesn't help when Sadwick is a very depressed character that is pessimistic about just about everything. Now, there is an underlying reason for this, and one seems to get used to the voice eventually. There are other poor efforts of voice acting too, but nothing that gets on your nerves. It's by no means all bad. Some characters are voiced quite well, especially some of the "evil" ones.\n\n(Note: I have only played the English version and can not comment on voice-overs in other languages)\n\nWhat is probably more annoying is the fact that the voice overs seems to go straight from one into the other with no space/break between them. Badly coreographed in other words. It even has a few lines broken off too early and even completely which is really poor. Hopefully they will come up with a fix for that.\n\nI also found the pointer/clicking to be quite unresponsive at times. I had to try another game to check if it was my mouse going bad or if it was in fact the game, and unfortunately/luckily it was the game. The controls was a bit clunky in the first place, but the unresponsiveness certainly didn't help.\n\nAchievements is a nice new addition, but also this seemed to be a bit bugged. There was a couple I should have gotten but never got. I'm not an achievement horder, so to me it doesn't matter much, but if this is something that is important to you it doesn't seem to work correctly. Probably an easy fix that they hopefully will deal with quickly enough.\n\nDon't let the negativity scare you off though. I still recommend this game for any fan of point & click adventures and anyone who appreciate a great story. The bugs/issues are easily overlooked if you are not to caught up in details. In fact the story itself is worth your money and time to play through this game. It also helps that it is from Daedelic, who is one of the companies who has kept this genre alive through hard times. And they have done so with lots of great titles. They deserve some support from us who appreciate games like this. Throw some money at them ;o).\n\n6/10","July 3, 2014","true","10.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The Whispered World isn't the greatest point-and-click adventure game I've played, but ultimately it's a solid game that handles its story, characters, and themes really well and features acceptable, if challenging, puzzle mechanics.\n\n\nThe best element of the game by far is its character development: specifically, the way the game develops its protagonist, Sadwick. To put it simply, Sadwick is utterly unlikeable when you begin the game. Picture a combination of Jeffery Dallas from the Julian Smith videos and Marvin the Depressed Robot from Hitchhiker's Guide--except that his complaining, self-absorbtion, and misery are all treated unironically, and not as a source of humor. He writes bad poetry about his feelings, sobs over his rotten circumstances, and loses his temper at his lovably senile grandfather. But while the game doesn't treat Sadwick's disposition mockingly, it also doesn't take him too seriously. Sadwick isn't an existential hero fighting helplessly against tragic circumstances. He's just an ornery kid with a lousy life who responds the way any self-interested person might.\n\nAs the game goes on, however, Sadwick slowly and subtly transforms to the point that you are genuinely concerned with his wellbeing and with the success of his quest. Where other characters inertly accept the coming end-of-the-world scenario at the center of the game's story, Sadwick steps up and tries to change things, certain as he is at first that his actions will prove pointless. The further into the game you go, the less gloomy and caustic Sadwick becomes. And as he grows in confidence--or at least determination--he becomes a truly sympathetic character. By the game's end, I loved the little guy.\n\nThe game's other characters are more of a mixed bag. Some, such as Grandpa, are quite lovable, while others, such as Bobby (the King's messenger) and Loucaux (the main villain) can be rather unlikeable or one-dimensional. The characters from the game's second section are my favorite. The sleep-deprived landowner Ruben and his loud, enthusiastic servant Bando form the perfect odd couple and are also the most objectively interesting characters in the game.\n\nOne thing that can be said for the game's characters is that they all embody the story's main themes in unique and fascinating ways. Time and again, characters that occupy "important" roles in the game's world prove powerless in preventing the world's end, while little Sadwick the clown from the traveling circus does all the work. But the characters in positions of authority are always weak because they choose to be--because the game's main theme is the contrast between activity and stagnation. So Bobby is paralyzed by fear and ultimately turns over his all-important mission to Sadwick. Ruben idly obsesses over his 10,000 silver pearls and can't even enjoy the luxurious life he has made for himself. And the King, who is supposed to save the world, lies dying behind locked doors that only he can open.\n\nIt's refreshing to see a story that recognizes that perfection is never static. It's not something that is whole and immaculate until it is broken, but rather something that people must actively work to maintain.\n\nThe Whispered World's story and gameplay unfold in four large sections, in which Sadwick does everything he possibly can to save the world despite a prophecy (known only to him) that he will ultimately be responsible for destroying it. The episodic structure of the game has some real benefits--and some pitfalls. For one thing, it means that you wind up going to many more locations and environments than you might in the typical point-and-click adventure game. Since there's not but so much backtracking, the game stresses progress and discovery and strikes a nice balance between presenting new areas and fully exploring old ones.\n\nBut since the game doesn't feature an overworld-style main area, you never feel especially grounded as you play the game. That factor, combined with the real sense of urgency in the game's plot, could make you impatient to make progress. And impatience in this game is a real killer, since some of the puzzles are dastardly hard to figure out. For the most part, the game isn't totally unintuitive--solutions usually make sense once you figure them out or look them up--but the game often doesn't provide many context clues to point you toward the proper solution to its puzzles, and certain gameplay scenarios would be near-impossible to figure out without help. I found myself checking a walkthrough almost every thirty or forty minutes, and I only rarely regretted giving up on certain puzzles.\n\nThe game is darned tricky, in part because there are just so many ways to interact with the game's environments. In addition to trying out items on environmental objects and on other items, as in most point-and-click adventure games, you can also use your pet caterpillar Spot, in any of various forms you discover throughout the game, to interact with things. And some puzzles require you to use the "mouth" icon (which is primarily used for speaking with other characters) on other objects or talk with the same characters on multiple separate occasions to open up new paths.\n\nApart from the gameplay and the story, The Whispered World features pretty good visuals. The hand-drawn backgrounds to each area are lovely and intricate, although they tend to carry somewhat of a melancholy mood. And the game's spare and lonesome music only adds to that effect. Character animations, on the other hand, tend to look unpolished and inexact, and somehow the cutscenes are even worse. The quality of the voice acting is so-so, with certain characters who are downright unlistenable, and the game ramrods lines of dialogue into each other, clipping off the first syllable of most lines and making the voices harder to listen to. Dialogue is snappy--Sadwick throws a lot of nice barbs at just about everybody he encounters--but occupies too much of the game. Conversations can go on forever, and you have to go through some of them really thoroughly to advance in the game.\n\nI mean it when I say that this game only gets better and better as it goes along. The story is great, and even the requisite big reveals at the end only add to the meaning of the game. The characters are nicely handled, the gameplay is fun when you don't get hung up for too long, and the game ultimately provides a really satisfying experience to anyone enduring enough to soldier through it.","December 30, 2014","true","9.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The only thing slightly unusual is that you have a pet creature following you around, which can also transform into different forms. And that regularly comes into play when trying to solve puzzles, thank goodness too because there are a lot of fun interactions made possible by this.\n\nSo what are the primary components of a traditional style point and click game? Well, that would be the story, the setting, the art, the dialogue, the voice acting and the puzzles. The parts where this game does well would be the art and the dialogue. The story and the setting show much more promise in the beginning, however as things start to unravel so does the strength of the writing.\n\nThat leaves us with the voice acting and the puzzles. Except for the main protagonist I wouldn't say the voice acting is especially bad, it is merely let down by bad editing. Plenty has been said by others of the main protagonist and his annoying voice acting, perhaps it was even intentional, but it is bad design to make him so when it serves no story purpose. The puzzle design varies greatly, some puzzles are illogical and appear to exist merely to frustrate the player, while others make use of the tools presented to you in an intuitive and satisfying to solve way.\n\nThere are also some UI issues that plague the game, but as it is a very minimilastic game I can overlook them.\nAll in all, I recommend it to point & click adventure game enthusiast, however not to very many others.\n\n6½ / 10","April 19, 2015","true","11.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I also ran into a bug and had to load a save that was 2 hours away before the thing i did mess up (altho i did it right acording to the walkthru).

The voice acting is mediocre, but fits the depressed character. The entire tone of the story is melancholic. The main character is a sad, bored clown roped into things beyond his means that he complains about doing the entire time.

To top it off, there aren't even every many hints or clues as to how one should be solving the levels, and nothing to keep track of objectives or goals required in order to proceed.\n\nThere are countless better point-and-click adventure games on the market.","August 24, 2015","false","17.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

This title struck out and I decided to purchase it due to the abundance of positive reviews. I had a nice time completing The Whispering World, but I expected more. The game is mediocre at best, containing certain pros and cons that end up making for a experience that is only memorable due to it's unexpected ending. Basically, it functions as a normal point&click game, this one being set in a fantasy world full of queer creatures and interesting places to visit and explore.\nThe art design is a positive aspect of this title, with original scenarios and striking detail existing in them. However, the low resolution at which the game runs can lower the bar for some gamers.\nThe achievements are easily obtainable and take, at maximum two playthroughs to complete them.\nNegatively, a hint system or something related would be appreciated. Countless times did I get stuck and had to look for a playthrough in order to continue the main quest. Also, the voice acting is of a poor-medium quality. Sadwick himself proves, after hours of hearing him talk, to have an annoying voice, something that can be game breaking for some.\nTWW does not offer any reason to replay it's main story, besides an achievement or two. The story is not good nor as it is bad. Just don't get your hopes up. The usage of Spot, Sadwick's pet, is original and distinguishes the game from other point&click titles. I did not have any problems running TWW, no crashes nor black screens. Many players report those problems, so beware of that.\n\nAll and all, I do recommend The Whispering World to the average point&click gamer. It can be an enjoyable title and besides, a sequel is in the works.\n\nRecommended achievement guide: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=257527365&insideModal=1\n\nRecommended walkthrough guide: http://www.gameboomers.com/wtcheats/pcWw/TWW/WhisperedWorld.htm\n\nScreenshot: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=478414606","August 25, 2015","true","9.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It has gorgeous animation and environment which looks like a fully animated feauture. The artistic theme of Fall colors are present from beginning to end and it ties in nicely with the overall tone and story. There are of course a few missteps, for one the main character Sadwick has an english voice that at times can seem a bit hard on the ears not to mention the silliness of it also kind of distracts from the otherwise pretty somber tone. However it's something I quickly got used to. As for the actual gameplay it is pretty standard adventure game fare, if you've played any of the classic Sierra or Lucas Arts point and click adventures from the 90's especially later titles like The Curse Of Monkey Island you know what to expect. For the most part the puzzles are simple enough but then sometimes you run into that one puzzle that just kinda stops you in your steps and you're forced to switch to a strategy of trial and error. Depending on your abilities some puzzles can be pretty hard to figure out. However that aside the soundtrack, artwork and story really is worth the price of admission on their own and this game has ended up being one of my favorite entries in the genre. Even better, with the special edition a lot of the technical game breaking issues have been fixed so if you were put off from buying this game because of the bugs in the original version (which all owners of the original version seem to have received for free since then) rest assured that this game works just fine and makes for an enjoyable experience.","December 5, 2014","true","10.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

In fact it's actually a really good game, with some exceptional faults that destroy the rest of the magic.\n\nThe game is a delight to view, the hand rendered backgrounds are exceptional and even the pen and line animations are good, if slightly halting at times. The cutscenes suffer a little as they pull completely from the Disney style animation and lack the richer background texture and colour palette.\n\nThe music is also a delight, and fits the fantastic world well, with soft natural tones that play quietly in the background and aren't a distraction at all. As for the voice acting, it was fairly bad. The narrator (Sadwick's voice) is nasal and annoying, to the point of being so annoying that I simply ended up turning the sound off and played by reading the subtitles. That said albeit it being annoying, the catch is the voice is a perfect one to suit the pessimistic, morose main character.\n\nNow coming to the characterisation, Daedalic seem to enjoy taking unlikable unlikely hero's and making them the protagonists (Rufus in Deponia). Sadwick continues this trend, he complains, and generally acts like a complete misanthrope, to the exasperation of not only his circus family, who deny him doing anything as he invariably messes it up  and himself. It's a difficult character to make a protagonist, as games require an active character, willing to undertake quests and action. As an unwilling character Sadwick seems "forced" and it makes him most difficult to identify with, however his lifting mood and transformation after a few success, that makes him more of an optimist alleviate this feeling, so it is worth sticking with. Spot serves as the ability extender in this game, and he is appealing not only for his unwavering dog-like faith and devotion to Sadwick, but also because you can't help wondering what creature he actually is that he can be dissected, set on fire and compressed and yet still survive. Spot is probably the games greatest mystery, and moreover his transitions between forms is amusing to watch.\nThe rest of the characters are fairly forgettable, with uninteresting dialogue and generic set-ups that don't add anything particularly new or interesting to the game, mainly serving as clue givers to the puzzle-solving scenarios.\n\nThe plot itself is short, and self-contained moves along fairly rapidly between puzzles and is otherwise well constructed, except for the dismal plot-twist ending. It is a plot-twist so generic, cliche and overused that it in fact lessens the impact of the game and delimits the otherwise more interesting philosophical underpinning to the game. It is meant to play upon your heart-strings and emotionally manipulate you, and it does achieve this, you will feel emotionally manipulated, butI still found it to be too disappointing, even though I suspected that he would "wake up and find it all a dream".\n\nThe gameplay is itself not bad as far as point and click games go. The major hold up is the frustrating menu system, that slows down interactions, requiring you to click the mouse twice to look, speak or touch and a rather clunky inventory system, that doesn't support mouse scrolling. Walking about is simple enough, however every now and then the click to walk would hang and I found myself only able to click on interactive objects, precipitating a need to exit and re-enter the area. A fairly frustrating little bug.\n\nI really would be able to recommend this short adventure game, but there are better titles out there to play. So only pick this up if it's on sale, you're a Daedalic fan and must own all their titles or have played most of the other more highly recommended point n click adventures and are still looking for a fix.","February 11, 2015","false","11.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's got great aspects for a standard point and click advanture, but just has a bunch of issues in there. I'll probably try the next game from Whispered World, but you need to know these things before you play:\n\n1. You won't be able to listen to the english voice acting, it's unbearable. It's an extreme amount better with german audio and english subtitles. Much more enjoyable. That's how I played through this.\n\n2. The save screen doesn't show where you are in the game for some reason, you just have to remember what time you saved and where.\n\n3. The ending is a gigantic cop-out.\n\nOther than that, this game is enjoyable. Here are complaints people may have:\n\n-Sadwick walks too slowly. This is avoidable by double clicking the next area, you'll go there instantly. You still have to walk over to places where you want to interact with an area, but traversing areas is very fast.\n\n-Autoscroll is wonky in places. This isn't huge, but is annoying.\n\nHowever, the game has:\n\n-Beautiful background art\n\n-Well done character design and animation\n\n-A fitting soundtrack albeit not super memorable\n\n\nAs much as I'd like to recommend this game, you really have to make an effort to enjoy it after the big 3 issues mentioned earlier. Chapter 2 is slow and a bit painful, but the other three are quite good. The ending of chapter 4 (end of the game) is almost impossible to figure out without a walkthrough. The very end of the game is totally out of place and somewhat clichéd. It doesn't fit the game and I didn't feel like it should have been there. Didn't really give closure.\n\nThe achievements aren't too demanding, but you should check the achievement guide before starting, because some you may have to do a second run to get if you don't do it right.","September 20, 2015","false","12.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I laughed exactly twice - and one of those was at *after* the credits had rolled.\n\nPersonally I think that the story could have been more interesting (and very different) if the deus ex machina at the end of the game had been explored throughout the entire game. I kind of don't want to say what that is because the authors clearly wanted it to be a surprise, but the entire game is a metaphore that you only discover once it's finished. I could go back and play it again to see if there were any clues, but honestly - it's not worth my time.\n\nGameplay wise it had an interesting mechanic with the pet catepillar named "Spot" being able to transform into different shapes, which is used a number of times throughout the game to solve puzzles. Some of these aren't obvious why Spot was necessary, but most of them make sense - however I felt the way you obtain new abilities after the first one is completely non-obvious and counter-intuitive, seemingly doing things that by all rights should have killed Spot.\n\n\nIf you're looking for a good point+click adventure game, I would recommend checking out The Book of Unwritten Tales, The Raven: Legacy of a Master Thief, The Longest Journey (not to be confused with Dreamfall: The Longest Journey), Toonstruck (if you can find a copy of it somewhere), The Dark Eye: Chains of Satinav and Edna and Harvey: The Breakout. If you've already played all those and are still looking for more adventure games then you might considder this one. I'd certainly play this over Deponia, but that's mostly because I couldn't stand the protagonist in Deponia.","May 24, 2014","false","9.0"," 8 of 20 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","8","20","0","0"

I like the humor and the adventure. Whispered World might have these qualities - I will never know - but I can't force myself to conquer such a depressive task.\n\nThe protagonist Sadwick is a tedious fellow. His voice acting is annoying, the character is depressing in his dialogue and posture even though the premise seemed intriquing.\n\nI honestly played through the tutorial and quitted. If you're interested in Whispered World I suggest that you look couple of Youtube videos about the main characters and the dialogue and then decide if this is your cup of tea.\n\nI have other games of this genre to play through and didn't want to spend the time with this title.","May 7, 2014","false","1.4"," 32 of 115 people (28%) found this review helpful","28","32","115","0","12"

This game is fun, has some decent puzzles (and some slightly obtuse ones), and pushes the limits on item-combining shenanigans, providing unique responses to almost every combination I tried. I liked the art style and was charmed by the complicated ideas it presented, as well as drawn to the nihilistic, cowardly, and deceitful Sadwick. I wasn't bothered much by the minor clicking glitches, too absorbed in doing everything possible to try to save or maybe destroy this world I got sucked into.\n\nBut then. The ending. The kind of an ending this got can work sometimes, if there's a sufficient buildup or a particularly engaging message. But this time, it just felt like nonsense, completely invalidating my investment in the game. I can't help but be pretty disappointed. All of the questions raised, like if there can be a stagnation-induced stability, or whether you could fight fate, or what the world's state means and why the people in power aren't fixing it, these questions are all dismissed in favor of some new character I have no reason to care about.\n\nStill, the enjoyment in the rest of the game was good enough for me to recommend it, though I'd try to wait for a sale if possible.","April 1","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
