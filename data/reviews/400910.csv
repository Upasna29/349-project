The explorable game world is giant, and is mostly non-linear.  There are literally dozens of bosses, many of which can be tackled in any order you want with few exceptions.   There is fast travel to minimize some back tracking, a shop where you can buy upgrades, and a ton of hidden secrets and items scattered all over the map.\n\nThe gameplay handles surprisingly well, and the music is top notch through the entire game.  The story is sort of meh, and there's a lot of dialogue that is painful at times to read through.  It doesn't detract enough from the game though.\n\nBoss battles seem to be at the heart of the game since there are so many.   They are bullet hell Touhou style fights with creative and insane barrage patterns.  Playing through blind on Hard right out of the gate, I found it to have the perfect level of challenge.  It's hard enough that you feel motivated to hunt down hidden power-ups, but fair enough to not discourage you.  After all if you get stuck on a boss there's always a few others you can try your luck on.\n\nAfter you beat the main final boss, which is a doozy of a fight that I won't forget soon, the game keeps plowing onwards after the credits roll into overtime with more challenges and extra content for those willing to see how deep the rabbit hole really goes. (See what I did there?)\n\nOverall highly recommended for fans of metroidvanias, the game is very lengthy for the price and the replay value is there as well.","February 1","true","22.4"," 116 of 128 people (91%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","91","116","128","7","7"

The only thing you'll see is some slightly revealing outfits and some minor yuri undertones. If you pass it up because of that, you're missing out on a ton of fun, trust me. (I think the game is a little underrated because of people thinking that.)\n\n\nNow then with that out of the way, Rabi-Ribi is a 2D bullet hell metroidvania platformer where you play as Erina; a Bunny Girl who is accompanied by Ribbon; a Fairy. Erina focuses on close range combat and Ribbon with long range.\n\nThe story essentially revolves around Erina finding her master then finding helpers to help find her Master's sister. While the story isn't too strong, the bullet hell boss battles & metroidvania aspects are definitely the biggest & best parts of the game. It's also non-linear (after prologue) so you can go and tackle the bosses in any order you want, it makes speedruns very interesting.\n\nPros+ Gameplay is very smooth & combat is satisfying\n+ Cute & well done pixel graphics\n+ Sprites & CGs couldn't be any more perfect\n+ Amazing soundtrack that fits very well with areas/boss fights\n+ Lots of different difficulties (from Casual to Bunny Extinction)\n+ Tons of boss battles (40+)\n+ Different badges to pick from which encourage different types of gameplay\n+ Many different areas & locations to explore and items to find & upgrade\n+ Non-linear\n+ Speedrun + Boss Rush\n+ Offers help (with buffs) when you get game over repeatedly (Normal or below)\n+ Lots of Steam integration (Cloud saving, trading cards, achievements, leaderboards) which I personally, really appreciate\n+ It has lots of replay value going for it with achievement hunting\n+ Developer is active in the Steam discussions\n+ Bunny\n\n\nCons (I had trouble actually finding reasons to dislike Rabi-Ribi)\n- Story wasn't too strong and was a little repetitive, but it works out\n- It had not too good optimization at first, but it's getting better\n- A few bugs here and there, mostly ironed out now (Nothing too major)\n- Boss battles get re-used a several times in the story (slightly annoying)\n- Slightly overpriced (If you go for all achievements, you get your money's worth for sure)\n\n\nAll in all, you can tell alot of work was put into the game and i'd definitely recommend Rabi-Ribi. I hope you can take my word for it with all my achievements and hours in it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/azusa_twin/recommended/400910/","azusa_twin","ティアラ μ's","http://steamcommunity.com/id/azusa_twin/","244 products in account","From CreSpirit comes a exploration platformer, bullet-hell, RPG, developed by CreSpirit and Published by Sekai Project.\n[Note - I have been provided a copy of this game by its publisher but it and has no effect on this review outcome]\n\nIntroduction/ StoryRabi-Ribi is a 2D exploration platformer that focuses on non-linear gameplay. There will be hints to guide the player along, but they’re never required to follow them, which allows for much greater freedom to—you guessed it—explore. I absolutely love this game as a whole mainly reason is that there is full freedom of exploration, you could easily spend your time not following the story and just hunting for hidden treasures or objects.\n\nRabi-Ribi follows the “mishop” adventure of Erina, whose routine life as a rabbit is turned upside down and inside out when she awakens to discover that, not only is she in an unfamiliar new world, but she has been transformed into a human girl…with rabbit ears and a fuzzy lil’ tail to match! As Erina ventures out into this magical new world in search of her Master, she meets the spunky pink-haired fairy, Ribbon, who mysteriously chooses to stick by Erina’s side. Together, these unwitting heroes embark on their quest to restore Erina’s life to normalcy, unbeknownst to the troubles that await them.\n\nGameplay ElementsOnto the gameplay elements , I absolutely adore the “customization” that you can do to the game like making it a whole lot easier or simply by making the game harder as a whole.\n\nBadges – Provably 1 of the biggest thing that you would use in Rabi Ribi, as you can see in the above screenshot I took a full offense badge setup. Basically it allows me to kill enemies relatively fast but if i were to take a hit, it would be a very very huge blow to my HP in Rabi Ribi.\n\nIn Rabi-Ribi you could do almost anything you want without following the story at all, for my case what I did was i spent an approx 10 hours exploring and trying to find power-ups mainly Max health power ups because my health is low since I took a full offense badge setup.\n\nControls – I am playing Rabi-Ribi on PC with a keyboard and the controls are good. The default settings are are well thought out and it can be fully customize allowing you to bind any buttons you want on the keyboard. [no cramping of 2 hands onto 1 side of the keyboard] I think having a good controls are very important because who wants to play a game with 2 hands overlapping each other? Using a gamepad is recommended for Rabi Ribi but it all comes down to personal preference as for me I prefer keyboard but it is up to you too choose!\n\nPower ups – These can can be bought each time for a set amount of [EN] a currency used in Rabi-Ribi and they can be bought ONLY after you defeat bosses and they agreed to go to Rabi-Ribi town as seen in the above screenshots and you can buy power ups from them. But do note these power ups do not last forever but can be repurchased again once it expires after a set amount of time.\n\nDifficulty level – A important factor people will look out for in bullet hell games, generally speaking from my experience for Rabi-Ribi it is very forgiving to new players, at the start on a new game you will be asked to choose a difficulty level. As for me I went for novice first because I do not have much experience in bullet hell games but I found it way to easy so I decided to go for hard mode which is challenging and not too hard for me. Well different people have different skill set. Novice is too easy because each time you die you will respawn, but with a damage reduction buff but as for hard mode there is none.\n\nEnemy attack patterns – For hard mode it is manageable and challenging at the same time but as for novice it is way too easy but if you do plan to play casually do go for a novice difficulty.\n\nAudio and Visual Elements and FeaturesThey are STUNNING I love the artwork of the CGs they are all extremely detailed. Soundtracks, the soundtracks are really great they fit into the battle that is happening in your screen it just makes the whole game feel more immersive and “cool” like you are really part of the fight, I absolutely love the soundtracks.\n\nTo sum up Do I recommend this game?Definitely a BIG, Yes I definitely recommend you to pick it up if you are a fan off bullet hell and great soundtracks and love treasure hunting with RPG elements. Last but not least bunnies!\n\nClick here for a full review with images and videos![azusantiara.com]","January 28","true","279.9"," 112 of 140 people (80%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","80","112","140","9","22"

I also melt inside each time Erina does a basic attack; her eyes squint ><.\n\nThe different moves you can execute with the direction pad and the attack button allows you to throw enemies into the air with aerial attacks, throw bombs and various other abilities that makes the fighting enjoyable. The controls are extremely intuitive, the devs did a great job by having a quick popup with simple instructions that appears whenever you learn new skills. If you happen to forget certain combos, it is the first thing you see when you open up the menu screen with ESC.\n\nThe various moves are actually necessary, for example you would find air attacks useful against air enemies or enemies on platforms above you.\n\nOnce you get the faerie helper, it feels like obtaining a bit device in R-Type except you can control its ranged firing direction and even charged attacks (good for aiming at enemies in the air while you're busy standing aside to dodge lasers).\n\nHell, you can even level up your faerie by attacking with it and that unlocks even more stuff.\n\nI started on Novice, but I believe the Hard modes would really allow you to utilize the full extent of your weaponry and skills. If you're a decent gamer, I would recommend starting on a higher difficulty (above novice) and work your way up or down.\n\nThe game is good at rewarding the player. In the first 15 minutes of gameplay the interactivity level is extremely high: killing enemies with different attacks; picking up objects; blowing holes through the ground; talking to npcs. Every little thing you do feels rewarding (e.g. killing an enemy literally throws it off the screen; obtaining an item is like getting the Master's Sword from Link to the Past.)\n\nFor fans of stories and anime character portraits, there are lots of little scenes here and there where you can enjoy the myriad expressions of the characters. If you're not a story fan, that's still fine, you can easily skip cutscenes and continue on (although the game does encourage you to watch them so that you can 'collect' the CG artwork in the gallery section). It's moe, but the characters all have their own personalities.\n\nCan't say much for the story yet since I'm an hour into the game, but it's definitely not a mindless 'be the hero / save blah blah' - the characters hint there's definitely various things going on behind the scenes. The story is pretty quick pace, things just keep popping outta no where. There is humour in the dialogue, but mostly for the anime audience.\n\nThe world seems pretty vast. As many reviewers have already pointed out that you can just level up, explore and have fun instead of continuing with the story, which gives some freedom.\n\nMusic is diverse, themes fit the location you're in.\n\nGraphics is what you see in the trailer above. There are windowed and full screen options.\n\nLittle references here and there from various games. At some point I swear I saw a springboard that looked like it was from Super Mario Bros to allow me to reach higher places.\n\nIt is clear that the developers put a ton of love into this game from all the minute details mentioned above. There seems to be many little gems to be discovered. I would have to say this game is very well polished. This is definitely one of those games that would amass a cult following.","January 29","true","20.6"," 52 of 60 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","52","60","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jamfrost/recommended/400910/","Jamfrost","Jamfrost Jamiro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jamfrost/","623 products in account","Rabi-Ribi did plenty to surprise me. I purchased it without knowing what it truly was, but as I entered the game and started experiencing it, I fell in love with everything it had to offer. By the way, this game has much to offer. The dev also keeps on adding to the game and polishing it with plenty of updates.\n\nIt features Erina, a bunny girl protagonist; a Metroidvania type of exploration and progression; a vast amount of items to purchase or find; secrets in the form of hidden paths, hidden rooms, or well-hidden items; a badge wearing system for powering yourself up; multiple projectile attacks that have charge shot variations; a big world with plenty of map space to uncover; a neat combo system that evolves over time as you acquire new moves; a wide array of different bosses that bring in the bullet hell element of the game; difficulty settings that can cater to anyone (I chose Novice); Speed Run and Boss Rush modes; and many anime ladies in tight clothing with some yuri undertones. It also lasted me about 19+ hours with 99% of the map revealed, 99% of the items found, and the final boss defeated (what a fight!). After the game is thoroughly beaten it’ll reset boss encounters so you can fight them again as you travel around to find those last couple of items trying to hide away from you.\n\nWhew. Okay, let’s talk about some aspects of the game in greater detail.\n\nThe StoryWe begin the story as a bunny girl that comes to and much to her surprise, she is in human form. From that point on, the mystery unravels as she seeks out her master and the cause of the bunny madness. The story relies more on humor than anything else, but does come with a bit of drama and sad realizations once you push far enough. However, the silliness takes the main stage for most of the game. Some aspects of the plot can seem convoluted and make it hard to follow as a result. Still, if you take the time to think about it or even go through a second playthrough which would help a bit I think, things start to fall into place. Overall, it did its job to keep me going forward without needing to worry about the more complicated aspects.\n\nBullet Hell and Difficulty The bullet hell aspect of Rabi-Ribi is restricted only to the boss encounters. That’s when the magic happens as tons of projectiles make their way towards you. You’ll have to dodge around and keep your hitbox safe until you can whack the boss hard with your hammer. Or you could pelt them with projectiles, probably charged shots, until you can close the distance. The game also lets you bring consumable items into battle to give you more of an edge against them. The boss fights are the most difficult aspect of the game. They start off easy, allowing you to face check bullets irresponsibly, but eventually, learning not to eat the enemy’s magic is the way to stay ahead in the fight.\n\nDifficulty selection is pretty important and the right one should be selected. I know I’m terrible at bullet hell type games and started off with Casual, the easiest difficulty. I thought it was much too easy for me and bumped it up to Novice. Keep in mind that you can’t change the difficulty on the fly. Over the course of the game, I did come across 3 or so bosses that were very, very tough and required multiple attempts until my skills improved enough to defeat them. One of them required the game’s help (it’ll ask you if you want help if you die too many times on the easier difficulties) which restored me to full health and gave me some buffs. That was very helpful and a big plus in making the experience more enjoyable and accessible for terrible players like me. Next time I’ll prepare properly and buy some buffs and heals in town. Finally, I’ll mention that there are two relatively long platforming sections (lasers themed/spikes themed) towards the end of the game that are extremely brutal and seemingly out of character for the game. I could’ve done without them and they are manageable (I did need the game’s help for the last one).\n\nGraphics and GameplayRabi-Ribi is mostly presented in a pixelated art style except for the UI, character portraits, and certain scenes. It comes with solid animations, something the art style definitely requires, to make the game look lively and the hammer combos awesome. The damage numbers, the projectiles all over the screen, movement/attack skills, and idle animations help to keep this game from feeling dead and static like other games with pixel graphics.\n\nThe strongest part of the game is the gameplay itself. You start off as a bunny girl with no weapon and a short jump. Then you find a hammer. Then you find Ribbon who supports you with projectile attacks. Over the course of the game, you turn into a combo beast with powerful ranged attacks that you can alter via staff selection to match the situation. You like uppercuts? They’re here. What about a double jump or an air dash attack? Or charging into an enemy with a charged shot as your opener before unleashing a 7 move hammer combo into a carrot bomb? There are many skills to find and upgrade. Most of the movement skills can hurt the enemy and can be stringed together in interesting ways. I’m especially fond of the camera zooming in mid-combo to make your hits seem even more powerful.\n\nBadges allow you to make Erina more powerful. You have a PP (Pack Points) limit such as 0/8 and you can equip enough badges to use up all the points. I had 100PP by the end which allowed me to equip a ton of different badges including ones that increase health, reduce damage, prevent statuses, cancel out of a certain move, increase mana, and on and on and on.\n\nThe metroidvania aspects are solid and encourage me to explore and gather as many power-ups and items as possible. Areas open up as you acquire the relevant movement skills or realize how to hunt for secrets. The maps are fairly vast with multiple zones that all tie together.\n-\nRabi-Ribi is a genre blending game that works extremely well and might be the metroidvania that you’ve been waiting for all this time. It has the content. It has the gameplay. It has the anime girls.","February 20","true","20.6"," 39 of 43 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","39","43","2","0"

It manages to find the perfect balance between being friendly to newcomers while also being tough as hell for veterans. It's a metroidvania-genre game mixed up with touhou-like bullet hell. You control Erina, a bunny which somehow got transformed into a human, on your journey you will visit many various locations (each one with gr8 ost, btw), all of which are filled with various collectibles, power-ups, etc. You will often come across places which you can't access yet, since you need an extra ability for that, so here comes backtracking, which imo is pretty well done, it doesn't really force you to do it.\nThe main part of the game are boss encounters which are really well made. They do get tough, often covering the screen with projectiles through which you have to dodge your way, however they all seem to be pretty fair, and most of the time after few tries you will be able to easily dodge through enemy's bullet hell. I would recommend this game to anyone, in fact I have never played any metroidvanias or Touhou's etc. and I still had a lot of fun with this game. So overall, I'd say it's worth every penny for which it's priced. Same goes for ost, awesome piece of music.\n\nFew things I forgot to mention\n-Characters are unbelievably cute :3\n-The game is in fact pretty long, took my 30h+ to get it close to 100% on my hard run\n-Bunny","March 21","true","82.7"," 31 of 32 people (97%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","97","31","32","5","0"

The game starts off slow, but when it starts giving you skills and more weapons, the combat picks up and starts to become not only exciting, but good old fun. But it's the addition of the bullet hell like mechanics that makes it stand out, and those come to a head in the game's strongest feature: the boss battles.  The game has a bunch of them: and each boss has reasonably different patterns from the next, forcing you to change up your strategies and run around trying not to die. I need to emphasize that the bullet hell mechanics feel at home in this game, and really do a good job of adding to the combat in several ways, and I'm surprised more games haven't gone this route with the mash up of genres. I've enjoyed the game from the get go, and while the platforming portions leave a bit to be desired, those who remember the old days of Castlevania on the GBA for example will find a game that they will enjoy for hours on end, as the game does bring the content for the big picture.\n\nLists:\nMy Positives:\nThe game brings the boss fights: and they are the highlight of the game. Bullet patterns go to the next level as it becomes a frantic battle of dodging everything the boss is throwing at you, while trying to get a hit or two in yourself. Great variety between the bullet patterns of bosses as well.\nMetroidvania fans will get their fix here. Enemies to kill, while still rewarding exploration of the map and finding all the hidden upgrades.\nGood selection of secondary weapons that change up strategy within battle, allowing for more advanced tactics.\nLike the Stamina/Magic meters implementation, as it forces more tactical gameplay and puts less focus on button mashing. Good combo system that grows as you play more.\nGood selection of difficulties that ranges from new players of the genre, to veterans of it.\nControls are perfect for the gameplay. Enough control to deal with the Bullet Hell mechanics, but not overly forgiving as well. It's in that sweet spot that you want out of games like these.\nMusic hits great exploration themes and does a good job of complementing the action in question.\nThose looking for a goofy and touching story, yeah, you'll get it here. Just don't expect Shakespeare.\nEnvironments are pretty aesthetic pleasing, and some of the cutscene artwork is fantastic.\nMy Negatives:\nThere's a couple of jumps that really are just absolutely unnecessary in the big picture. Think of the TMNT sewer jump from the NES era, but you can't just walk across it. It takes absolute precision and is 95% luck most of the time. It stands out from what's generally very easy platforming in a bad, bad way.\nSound design is pretty weak overall. No noticeable impact to gameplay when isolating it (aka turning it off).\nSomething about the sprites needs just a bit more detail in the long run. They aren't bad, is just feels like it just needs one more element to it.\nSometimes the humor gets to the point of groanworthy. Like, legendary groanworthiness.","January 30","true","5.8"," 45 of 57 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","45","57","4","0"

Liam Neeson guest stars as Kevin Mask for the final showdown with Mantaro Kinniku (played by Christian Bale) for the heart of Gotham City.\n\nPros:\n-Samus wears a bunny costume like in Castlevania 1 without needing a cheat code.\n-Your R-Type's force device is now a fairy.\n-You do not need to change R-Types to use different forces - the fairy does it all.\n-About 5 hours into the game and I haven't already beaten it (take that Metal Gear Solid 3!).\n-Multiple patterns per health percentage on bosses so the AI has a chance to mix things up on you slightly, unlike the more static Toehoe.\n-Men only exist in some god awful evil dimension where life can't be solved by violence with a hammer.\n-Damage numbers do not reach beyond two digits like in Vanilla WoW. Pandaland fans, sorry.\n\nTradeoffs:\n-The cast of enemies is goofy and rated E for Everyone, but this is balanced out by the usage of scantily clad females as bosses.\n-Adam's storytelling disrupts immersion, but it can be skipped thank god.\n\nCons:\n-Upgrade/skill design is somewhere on a Megaman 3 level when we're already playing Megaman 12.\n-If you're not a fan of dodging bullet spam, you might want to buy a different game.\n-15 cards per badge, really? I don't care how cute they are.\n-No sign of Dobkeratops and I'm already four hours into the game.\n-Due to budget constraints the 15.7-bit graphics of Super Metroid were downgraded to 8-bit for this game.\n-I'm 15 minutes into trying to write a review and Liam Neeson still hasn't killed anyone.\n-Kevin Mask Jr. wins that fight in the manga.\n\n================\n\nTL;DR - It's a fun game reminiscient of all the good times platformers gave you in the NES~SNES days. The pricetag might seem a bit hefty, but it's done well enough to justify it.\n\nThat and I paid how much for 1.8 hours played in Skyrim?","January 29","true","101.7"," 65 of 94 people (69%) found this review helpful 73 people found this review funny","69","65","94","73","3"

Also, because of them bunny girls, obviously.\n\nGuys, seriously, there's no telling in how GREAT this game is.\n\nThe gameplay is so damn fun, sometimes it feels like you're playing a sidescrolling hack 'n slash.  It has great music and colorful graphics. It is difficult AS HELL despite it's cute looks and easygoing plot.\n\nAnd the boss battles. Man, the boss battles are the main feature of this game. It is awesome to get past each attack pattern and victory feels so damn rewarding because it's so FOCKING difficult, without being cheap. No matter how difficult it is, you know that the game gives you what you need to win.\n\nIt is one of those games that you actually feel sorry for finishing it. Despite it took me around 26 hours to finish it, I just wish it were longer because it's been a long time since I enjoyed so much a game like Rabi-Ribi.\n\nPROS:\n\n- Awesome danmaku/metroidvania hybrid\n- Great gameplay\n- Excellent music\n- Fun plot\n- Charismatic characters\n- Erina is so adorable\n- Lots of content\n\n---\n\nCONS:\n\n- Repetitive enemy sprites\n- Some level design flaws\n- Could have more CGs\n\n---\n\nI can't recommend it enough to anyone that enjoy a challenging game.\n10/10, will play again for sure.

Saw the possibility that it was chock full of things to find and do since it had like 80+ achievements, with only the screenshots and summary of the store page only helping more.\nI then decided to play this game on Hard, it was fine at first but then it finally began kicking my ♥♥♥ (Which is something I enjoyed). Now I'm trying to get good at speedrunning this game and it's still kicking my ♥♥♥ with all the technicalities it can have during the run.\nMy only real complaint about this game would be that they put a small tiny bit of lyrics into one of the songs, but that's just a pet peeve really.\nOh, and Irisu. ♥♥♥♥ Irisu.\nI'm just happy that it's quite clear the devs really care about this game and want to see it strive for the better with the constant, yet small updates it's been getting. At the start of it's launch it was running quite slowly on my computer with the places that were very graphically heavy, mainly the backgrounds. But after so many updates, the game runs at a much faster pace. And that's not even counting the artbook (If you really love this game, get the artbook too, you won't regret it) that finally came out and the small easter eggs now scattered around the world.\n\nMy only advice would be not to judge this game on the fact that it's a cutesy anime-styled game. It will kick your ♥♥♥ to Hell and back if you do so.","May 3","true","633.7"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","6"

I thought the price was too high and so bought it with the intention of refunding it after trying it out. I usually don't buy games until they're on sale for under $8 but ultimately I was content to pay double that.\n\nThe game strikes a nice balance between the bullet hell and Metroidvania aspects and features a large explorable world with a non-linear gameplay. There are tons of great boss fights and you can fight most of them in any order you like. One of the best things about the game though might be its soundtrack. It's without a doubt one of the best I've ever heard. I liked it so much that I later purchased the soundtrack separately.\n\nIf I had to say anything negative about the game it would be about its absurd and nonsensical story, but certainly no one came into this expecting a story rich game from one whose initial premise is a bunny being magically transformed into a bunny girl who then has to run away from furries and somehow end up trying to save the world. Still, the game would have naturally benefited from a better story. The dialogue is rather cringeworthy as well but fortunately none of this takes away from how fun the game is.\n\nGet the game for its fantastic gameplay and soundtrack (or maybe to fulfill your secret furry fetish).","February 1","true","58.6"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","16","20","4","0"

Gameplay\n+++ RADICAL Soundtrack! +++ Easily my favourite thing about the game!\n\n- Characters which are even more flat than the games Graphics\n- Not very creative dialogue/Story\n- Translation that feels kind of off here and there\n\nAll all its a quirky platformer with high production quality.

Its well worth the money and might even have been a classic back then. Most important might be that it doesn't take itself too seriously and neither should you.\n\nEdit: I have now finished the game and find my mind wandering back to it from time to time.

Even if you don't like anime stuff, you would love this game if you love Metroidvanias.\n\nIt has pretty and cute pixelated graphics, an amazing soundtrack, very fun gameplay that keeps getting even more fun the more you progress, cute and sexy cutscenes and a huge world to explore. What makes the game so special is how it's very non-linear, you can go where you want and fight which bosses you want in the order you want.\n\nIt's sad that many people will skip this game because they will be repulsed by how it looks like ecchi anime stuff to get weeaboos money. Even I clicked "Not interested" at first, but I came back the second time and got interested after reading it mixed my two favorite types of games.

But this game is really cool. The art style is pretty fun, don't mind the actually sexy kawaii girls if you're not into it, i'm talking about the general art style, it's pixel art and a pixel art done GOOD.\n\nIf we're talking about the musics, i'd say the soundtrack is good, themes are fitting areas very well, and it goes from melancholia to comedy music. I actually really like how various is the soundtrack.\n\nGameplay-wise, it plays very well. The game runs at 60 fps and the gameplay is smooth as butter. Erina can do some pretty good combos, jumps are easy to do, the fairy shooting elements are interesting and can be very useful in bossfights. Oh, and talking about bossfights, there are a LOT.\n\nI've heard that you can manage to beat the game in normal mode, in about 15/20 hours. But seriously, since this is a metroidvania + Bullet-Hell combined game (Like Touhouvania), I'd recommend you to play at least on hard difficulty (well, the harder difficulties are locked anyway until you finish the game).\n\nAdded to this, you also have a Speedrun mode and Bossrush mode to unlock. You also have a galery if you wanna see the kawaii waifus in CG again, and a Soundtest if you wanna listen to the awesome soundtrack. Now, I kinda regret that I didn't pick up the bundle with the Original soundtrack, but since you can buy it as a DLC, it's no big deal.\n\nEnjoy cutieness, colorful graphics and smooth gameplay, I assure you that you'll enjoy this game, which is worth the actual price!","February 7","true","31.4"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

Huge map; beautiful and smartly designed locations; nice music; solid gameplay with responsive controls; bloody bullets are everywhere; cute girls as challenging bosses — what else do you need?\n\nYou can call this game “bullet hell cutelvania”: it’s cute, it’s metroidvania and you will meet a hell of a lot of bullets — almost every enemy will shoot (or cast) projectiles that you want to dodge, not meet. Regular enemies are not that hard to face (well, later in the game they will cause you trouble), but with bosses that “bullet hell” thing goes up to 11 and higher. Enemies (regular and bosses) look a little the same: cute girls, fairies, animals and… things. However, their attack patterns are unique and every boss battle is tense, unique and difficult.\n\nGameplay: it is your metroidvania: you explore the giant world; you find bosses; you defeat bosses; you become friends with bosses; you find abilities that allow you to progress through blocked paths. Here is another twist: you can fight almost any boss in any order that you prefer. The game will set you quest marks on the map, but you may ignore them and freely explore other areas. You can also complete the quest without visiting marks.\n\nStory: bunny turns into a bunny-girl. Missing master’s little sister, Girl x Girl romance, bunny-obsession conspiracy and the search for hidden world defender successor. Yeah, the story is somewhat weird (in a good way), not that deep (in a bad way), a little bit clumsy, but interesting to follow nonetheless.\n\nCharacters: My master’s little sister sometimes pretends that she is a tree. Which is lovely.\n\n\nP.S.

I'm in love with this game.  I've only had this game for two weeks and I'm already losing track of how many times I've played though it.  Meanwhile my $60 AAA titles are collecting dust on the shelf and I couldn't care less.  Moar bunnies plz.\n\nWhat I thought at first glance was just a fanservice title has impressed me at every turn and quickly became one of my all time favorite games.  In my eyes its success is owed to its focus on just a couple simple, but fun, concepts: you explore, collect items, and fight bosses.  This is no second-rate knockoff however -- this is a true Metroidvania/Touhou experience and I daresay even better than its predecessors from which it derives its inspiration.\n\nThe exploration is clearly in the spirit of Metroidvania, and the game's non-linear story grants you a lot of freedom to tackle events in just about any order you wish.  I myself had such a blast exploring that I ended up clearing most of the game while still in the first chapter.  Boss encounters take after the Bullet Hell genre; if you are a fan of Touhou and the like you are in for a real treat.  Bullet patterns are original and fun to learn, and with the number of difficulties available to the player both novices and veterans alike will find a suitable challenge.\n\nThe graphics are simple, but colorful and pleasant.  The soundtrack is incredible and does a stellar job of capturing whatever setting you may find yourself in -- it is more than worth the extra $5 or $6.  I found myself streaming it off YouTube whenever I wasn't playing the game and soon realized it was a must-buy.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the developers are very active in the forums and are continuing to patch in new, free content.  Just recently they added 3 new bosses, how great is that?  It's obvious they love their game.\n\nAnd I love playing it.  Get this game!!!","February 28","true","178.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Much of the time it's a 2D Metroidvania exploration game with dozens of upgrades scattered around a big 2D-platformer game world, and a (sequence-breakable) set of mobility upgrades that help you explore said world.  Sprinkled liberally throughout are boss fights wherein the game suddenly becomes a bullet-hell dodge-and-counter action game, complete with the genre-conformant unreasonably-tiny hitbox on your character to make it possible to dodge the crazy attack patterns many of the bosses can dish out.\n\nThe plot is a bit ridiculous, but it's clearly just there for window-dressing, so I find that entirely forgivable.\n\nIf you like both Metroidvania-style action-platformer games and bullet hells, this is the game for you. Buy it, now.\n\nIf you like Metroidvania-style games but don't really feel like dodging bullet storms, you should probably buy this game anyway. Just play it on a lower difficulty setting; the main difference between difficulties is how many different attack patterns each boss gets.","May 10","true","73.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

On anything I do give a review on, I either really disliked it, or I absolutely loved it. In this case, I absolutely fell in love with this game.\n\nI'll try to keep this short: as of the time I am writing this review, I have only completed the game once on normal mode, cuz I honestly suck at bullet hells and I do plan on getting more achievements for it, maybe all of them. I'll start off by saying this about the game: the music is just amazing, I loved loved loved it. Bought the soundtrack and it was in Flac files so you may need a converter if you want to put them in an mp3 player. I don't know how to rate the gameplay, but I will say it was a lot of fun just exploring through the world and finding all the secrets it had. The boss battles were challenging but not to the point of frustration in normal mode, for me at least. The characters were really loveable, though some I do have trouble remembering since there are a lot of them and only some actually played a big part in the story. The story, at first I thought it was alright because I did not know there were extra chapters after the first credits. After actually finishing the game, I thought the story was pretty well made, with a nice shocking plot twist at the end.\n\nI shall stop there to keep this review as short as possible, and I do want to spread the word about this amazing game and I really hope there will be more in the future about these loveable characters, even a spinoff would be fine by me. Buy the game if you like bullet hells and/or platformers and/or cute bunnies that turned into humans bashing people with a hammer.

And sometimes, instead, it's a stylistic choice in the scope of telling your own story.\n\nWith the former kind cluttering up Greenlight and the Steam Store you would be led to believe Rabi-Ribi is no different, but it's instead very much the latter. It's a lot more skilfully put together than one might think at first blush, except maybe for the kind of threadbare character concepts here and there.\n\nTo put briefly, it's a Metroidvania type game with bullet hell elements (though a lot more forgiving than the genre's standard) and a huge map with a lot to see and do. Overall, you do get your money's worth out of this, so go ahead and try it without fear.","May 2","true","37.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

The story also is really cute and they make beautiful use of visuals and UI. On top of all that? The game is surprisingly long.

What? nothing special!? She's beating people left and right with her hammer! it's unprecedented!" - Otaku taking pictures of Erina\nThat's what the game is about, you play as a rabbit, Erina, who suddenly finds herself in human form wearing bunny clothes in a hospital, following a mysterious voice, you end up waking up in a forest, sleeping on the lap of a girl who runs away the moment you wake up, from here on out, you are on your own, you have complete freedom, but I'll start by covering the game the way you are expected to play it\n\nThis game is a sidescrolling platformer with heavy emphasis on bullet patterns like shoot em up games like Ikaruga, Crimzon Clover, Touhou etc, I'm not big on platformers but I really like shmups and I have to say the combination works damn well, your weapons are a hammer, explosive carrots and Ribbon, a little (and scantily dressed, if this is a problem for you) fairy with 7 shot types, each comes with their own normal and charged shots and a Boost attack that will attack all enemies on screen while creating a little area that will buff you as long as you are inside it\n\nAt first, by using these weapons you earn experience that will improve them, but you will max and forget about them very early in the game, later on you will find items that give you new skills like hammer rolling or flying hammer dash, or passive skills like moving at normal speed while underwater, less damage from spikes and also consumable healing items\n\nYour objective is to go around mercilessly destroying anything that opposes you because it seems everyone here loves to fight, as some 4th wall jokes will imply, from little animals to weirdos from an organization with an unhealthy obsession with rabbits (which are extinct in this world, you are like a godsend to them), although the bosses are supposed to be your friends, and if not, beating them into submission will fix that, after which they go back to town and will help send you into the real world to discover what's going on, there you get to beat otakus trying to get pictures of you (and if you are careful you get to fight the director of the game apparently).\n\nAs for stuff to do after you beat the game, it has you covered, when you beat the final boss, you unlock boss rush mode and in story mode there is something else that needs to be taken care of, featuring 3 more bosses, 2 of them in very intense dungeons, and then when you clear this post game you unlock another boss rush mode, speed run mode and if you go back to your save you can fight all bosses again but there are also special, lv 336 versions of 3 of them\n\nNow then, say you don't have enough with all that, you have MAX ranked, no damage clear every boss and want more, the achievements show that you can play the game in challenging ways that after one proper playthrough might make you think it's impossible, I suggest you read this only after you have cleared the game once, or at least not attempt any of this in your first playthrough\n\nAt the beginning of the review I said you have complete freedom, you can play the game events in any order you like, you are supposed to go back to town as soon as possible, but you can beat a bunch of bosses and delay your return to town anyway, there is also an achievement for beating the game without the hammer and another for doing a no items run, except for items that are forced on you by the story, if you have already beaten the game normally this might sound crazy but I heard when you attempt a 0% items run the game spawns springs and platforms to reach certain areas that might require double jump for example\n\nIn short, this game is an absolute blast, if you get fooled by the appearance of the game (or more specifically, the scantily dressed characters) you are missing out, but I would recommend it more because of the bullet hell aspect rather than the platforming one","June 2","true","42.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","3"

This is the sort of 2d metroidvania genre we should be getting!\n\nBlending a fun mixture of 2d platforming, shooting with magic, and your mighty Piko hammer! You are a bunny turned girl adventuring across the lands to find your owner (master). Once you find your owner though you need to find your fellow bunny that your owner also has!\n\nTons of bosses. The bosses are a mixture of bullet hell, and traditional old school platformer bosses.\n\nIf you enjoyed games like megaman. MegamanZX. MegamanZero. Super Metroid. Castlevania. You'll more than likely enjoy this lovely little hit.\n\nAlong with bosses is a combo system. More damage you do to the boss while not getting hit, the stronger you get! E-D-C-B-A-S-SS-SSS and MAX. D gives 5% damage up to all of your attacks. Every rank above that gives another 5% up to 40 if you're in the MAX combo meter. Getting hit only removes a single rank of your combo.\n\nAlso the game has double jump so basically GOTY for me.\n\nPros.\nFast paced combat and adventuring.\nEasy to learn, low curve of learning your own skills leaving you have fun challenging the bosses.\nLOTS of bosses!\nAlmost all of the characters in the game are animal people like nekomatas. ALL FEMALES TOO!\nNice, cute pixel graphics.\n\nCons.\nSome bosses could use a tiny bit more tells.\nSome bosses have attacks that mildly blend into tile sets in their arena.\nA tiny bit too much dialog here and there.

I will be honest, I wasn't expecting too much from it, in my mind I was thinking it was going to be another Metroidvania type game that I would be able to drop after beating it once, but I was completely wrong, this game has a lot to offer than can easily keep me glued for much longer. I will go as far to say this is one of the best Metroidvania games I have played and easily in my top 5 of games I've played on Steam. The developers really went above and beyond with this game and I thoroughly enjoy this game as do others.\n\n- The graphics are simple and clean, which is never bad, not everything has to be "top of the line" especially for a Metroidvania/bullet hell game, and this game matches it perfectly. The artwork added in, whether the sprites, background or CG was done phenomenally. None of the art seems dull at all. I've played a lot of Metroidvania games and there have been a few where the colours just made a certain level, if not the overall game seem dull. Be that the characters or the background. This isn't an issue in Rabi-Ribi. The colours blend perfectly for the characters and the background of levels, and in my opinion, that's what a huge factor that keeps a game alive where you don't start to get bored, which the developers and artists nailed perfectly.\n\n- Smooth controls and mechanics. Definitely one of the better games that have smooth controls and mechanics, in which I had no problem learning what I needed to.\n\n- Music is spectacular and beautiful, there's a lot of music in here which matches the levels, bosses and generally what's going. The composers who worked on this OST know what they're doing and how to truly bring something more alive, solely through music, and that has high respect. There's not too many games out there where I feel that the composer(s) can actually make a game feel more enjoyable and alive, through the music. These composers made that happen and I'm glad a soundtrack was included with the game (quick note, you unlock the soundtrack after beating the game on hard mode.)\n\n- There's a lot of characters to meet, even the regular NPCs that don't really do much except give you tips or just random words. The main characters have their own personality which further adds to the story and character development.\n\n- Easter eggs / references. I noticed quite a few in here, which I always like to find. From Megaman, to Mario, to Nekopara and to Metroid (I think we all remember something like this near the end of Metroid Zero Mission http://i.imgur.com/JiwjFQI.jpg ) I'm sure there's plenty more in here, subtle references I may not have gotten or seen, because it may be from a game/TV show I have never seen.\n\n- There is a lot to do gameplay wise, story wise and achievement wise (you guys keep adding new achievements with updates and I'll forever love you for that.) They honestly went all out for this game. You can follow how to story should go or you can mess the order up of things by utilizing secret abilities and finding hidden areas, which gives you a lot more freedom to the game. The story is great and a little on the long side for your first play through while you're still adventuring and figuring the whole game out. Items are scattered out in obvious and hidden places, just like any true Metroidvania game should be, and there's a lot of items to collect. The Bullet Hell tag might be a little off putting to some people, but please don't jump ahead and think the game is almost all bullet hell. Boss fights are the only place where you will find true bullet hell, and in boss fights is where they go at it with bullet hell, some of which are actually a challenge. This game is pretty casual on the lower settings, however it does offer a challenge. The bosses level up naturally as you get further and by what items you have. I started on the Novice setting and there were a few bosses that actually made me sit and think that I can't just go in attacking and instead have to actually take it slow and worry about dodging instead of attacking all the time. The achievements on here have a nice amount to earn and they are pretty creative in terms of names and how to get them, which is going to personally keep me glued to it longer, and a lot of these, are going to be a challenge, which I'm looking forward to achieving. Speed running, no damage boss fights and other achievements that utilize how you can change the order of the events like mentioned above. One thing that I love, is I have never been so under-prepared for a final boss fight in my life. I went in there with health items to restore health and that was a ride. I'm not going to say too much about it, but I definitely wasn't ready at all, and that made it so much better because of how much I underestimated the final boss would be. Whoever can get the achievement for beating that boss without getting hit 3 times (thank you developers for not making it no damage at all) truly is something else, that just looks like one of the bigger achievement challenges I've seen in a while and it's going to kill me getting that, but one day I will.\n\n- The developers honestly seem like they care about their community, which is rather refreshing. They seem active in the discussion forums, so much so to release patches when there's bugs and even go out of their way to help people when they can, when a player is having an issue with the game or playing the game. They're creative with their update titles instead of the generic "update/version 1" like you will normally see.\n\n- Bunny.\n\nOverall, this game is something definitely worth trying. Great gameplay, beautiful soundtrack, outstanding artwork, characters with their own little world of personalities, developers who are active and listen, loads of achievements to work for. I would definitely recommend you give this game a try if you enjoy Metroidvania, platformer, bullet hell, Anime type games or even if it's just something new you want to try out. I'm not disappointed with this game at all, I haven't run into any troubles with and I'm overall impressed with everything about the game. I don't know if DLC is a possibility in the future, but if so, I honestly look forward to it.\n\nEveryone who worked on Rabi-Ribi, great job on creating this masterpiece!","February 20","true","208.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It is so much more than just that\n\nRabi-Ribi is a fantastic metroidvania+bullethell game with cute visuals and lovely music. There's a little fan service but it's not its biggest focus.\n\nIn this game you navigate a bunny girl named Erina through maze-like enviroments where you have to expand your map by exploring.\nErina carries a pico hammer as her weapon and her little fairy follower named Ribbon, assists her with her ranged magic attacks. On your quest you'll learn various skills, that will help you reach new areas, bosses and secret rooms, which may give you useful power ups to make Erina stronger.\n\nBacktracking is neccessary, but this is one of the few kinds of games where backtracking is actually fun and rewarding.\nRemember that ledge that was too high up to reach the last time you were here? Not a problem anymore. We can jump higher now.\nHow about this power up that seems to be stuck in the wall since the very beginning of the game? Just blow the wall up with your new ability to drop bombs then and pick it up.\n\nThe bosses in this game can be pretty tough. This is not an easy game.\nLike mentioned before, there are bullet hell elements in this game, so careful and precise movement may be needed to dodge many of the Bosses' attacks.\nLuckily, the game's controls are pretty good and there are many difficulty settings to choose from.\n\nJust don't be over confident when you choose difficulty, as you cannot change it without starting over from the beginning.\nBy modern standards, "easy" difficulty in this game would be considered "normal" or possibly higher if it was in any other game.\nHard means HARD. And let's not mention the two difficulty steps above that.\n\nThis game has a lot of content, a big world to explore and a lot of replay value. Expect to get at least 20+ hours out of this game, possibly even on just a single run.\nIf you were to find everything in the game and 100% it and it's main game, post-game, and post-post-game, along with doing boss rushes etc, you'll likely get a triple digit number of hours.\n\nPros:\n*Fun exploration\n*Satisfying boss battles\n*Good controls\n*Nice music\n*Cute visuals\n\nCons:\n*The story is mostly nonsense (which I personally don't mind)","February 19","true","34.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Nothing fantastic but something you can bob your head to when you're weeabooing out.\n\nI got nothing much else to say.

However, let's get off of this.\n\nGameplay:  The gameplay in this title is absolutely solid. Normal enemies do get kind of boring at times(though, if you're not carefu;, they can get you), but the bosses are the absolute peak of hell. I have spent 4 hours fighting  Vanilla(a reference to Nekopara, which is also published by Sekkai Project)  and still enjoyed it. By the end of the game, you will have a large amount of unique techniques for fighting, my particular favorite so far being the Bunny Strike(Down+Z+C on my keyboard).\nNow, the fights are not the only major part of the gameplay. Exploration is just as, if not more, important in its own way. The game is extremely non-linear, though it may not seem like that at first. For instance, there was one miniboss I accidentally skipped over just by running around and finding a secret passageway. I found a way to temporarily bypass the boss that gave me so many troubles and get more health, this only being possible due to a wall that wasn't really a wall and the Hidden Tech: Reverse Wall Jump.\nOh, yes, there are hidden moves you can discover. My personal favorite is Reverse Wall Jump, but I'll let y'all discover them on your own(or use a guide, but that's cheating).\n10/10 on gameplay\n\nStory:  The story is nothing great, especially when 90% of it seems to be skippable(not even joking. There's a legitimate achievement for skipping what sees like a major plot point). Basically, you're a bunny named Erina that get transported and turned into a human in, of course, the highly provocative bunny suit(this is even made fun of by another character later in with the phrase "I know less clothing means better armor, but..."). Later, you meet a fairy named Ribbon, blah, blah, blah...\n4/10 on story, may change it later on if it gets better\n\nAesthetic/Graphics:  Let me first give you all a disclaimer; I am an anime fan, but I'm not one for excessive fanservice(which Sekkai Project games seem to have quite often). This game, on the other hand, doesn't quite pronounce it the way many animes and anime styled games do(such as the Hyperdimension Neptunia series by Compile Heart, which literally has one character Thunder ♥♥♥♥ on a regular basis). While it certainly is present(I mean, just look at the picture on the page), it is, by no means thrown into your face at every possible interval, and I appreciate that. As for the graphics, the dialogue is presented in the typical visual novel form, which is kind of bland, but is okay when well done, such as in this title. The characters are all well-drawn, no two characters really seeming like they're clones of each other in terms of design(except for normal enemies, but they're literally clones of each other). The overworld appearance is a very different discussion, and this part is what made me first take notice of the game; it has pixel graphics, but unlike many pixilized games, you don't feel as though you're character is completely different from everything else in the game(such as with Cave Story. I hate insulting CS-it is my favorite game, after all-but I do have that major gripe with it). The overworld sprites are all well done, but many characters' overworld sprites really won't be memorable(especially the non-URPRPC enemies(by URPRPC, I'm not referring to the collector's edition of the game)). Overall, the game is aesthetically pleasing.\n8/10 could be improved\n\nMusic:  I don't play games with sound, so no opinion here.\n\nOverall Rating:  I highly recommend this game if you want a challenge, but before you buy it, I would first suggest playing any Touhou game(they are free and can be found here - http://www.vocaloidotaku.net/?/topic/201-touhou-game-downloads/ - I personally suggest number 13, but that's just my preference) and Cave Story(free on cavestory.org, or you can buy Cave Story + on Steam(though there really isn't enough of a difference to constitute the $10 price tag). If you enjoy those two games and want a game filled with secrets, this game is definitely for you.\n8.5/10 glad I found this game","May 8","true","81.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Early on in this quest, she meets a fairy named Ribbon. Through the whole thing, you'll be greeted with a fairly enjoyable story, although it does sometimes just come in large chunks spread out across the map.\n\nRabi-Ribi is a Metroidvania bullet hell game that will really challenge you. It features numerous difficulties, and even with playing the game on Novice (the lowest one), I still had some bosses I struggled against. With being a Metroidvania, expect to be doing a lot of backtracking as you unlock new abilities and gain access to precious inaccessible areas. There's a lot to collect and find as well, so if you're a completionist, expect to spend a long time on this game.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed Rabi-Ribi quite a lot. I did feel that the "larger" sprites (IE: when you're under the Giant debuff) looked a bit poor, and I did spot a few grammar mistakes. However, despite all that, Rabi-Ribi is a very enjoyable game if you enjoy either Metroidvania or bullet hell games. If you're looking for a game that will give you plenty to do, and will also give you a nice (and sometimes frustrating) challenge, then I'd definitely suggest looking into the game. If you're on the fence about it and feel like the $18 price tag might be a bit too high for you, I'd suggest waiting for a sale and getting it then.\n\nDisclaimer: I was provided a copy for review purposes by the publisher.","February 14","true","16.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Slashley/recommended/400910/","Slashley","Slashley","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Slashley/","126 products in account","Hmm. I'm quite torn should I give this game a thumbs up or thumbs down.\n\nWell, let's start with categorizing the game: It's a mix of Metroidvania and Bullet Hell during bosses.\n\nThe first complaint: A good Metroidvania gives you the illusion of freedom, while actually pushing you into one direction for your next upgrade which will then unlock the next area and so on. A good Metroidvania will flow beautifully from one area to the next.\n\nRabi-Ribi fails at this COMPLETELY. The game is mostly open... except when it goes "NO SAMUS, you're not AUTHORIZED to use the Varia Suit in this hot area!"\nBecause yes, that happens on numerous occasions in this game. Instead of limiting your path with obstacles which you can't clear with your current gear, the game just goes "We can't go there!"\nThese are reduced a lot after Chapter 1, but a couple of such places remain even afterwards. I find this baffling. If you want to keep an area off-limits due to plot reasons, why not just put a clearly fake wall there instead? And when it is plot time, a simple cutscene can open it up. That's a lot less frustrating than walking in an empty corridor only to have the game go "Ha ha, NO! Go elsewhere!"\n\nAnyway. The game world is also very vast, which brings forth a major issue: You can easily - and I mean EASILY - get really, REALLY frustrated at how you can't go into places or get items because of your lack of upgrades. And you have NO idea where these upgrades are. So you just keep running and running and running and you see small holes you just can't fit into over and over and clearly you're SUPPOSED to have that item by now but you don't but you still don't run out of places to explore and you keep going and going and graAAAHHHH!!\n\nSeriously, it is really, really annoying. A good Metroidvania would "lock" you into an area until you find the upgrade you need to proceed. This game, past Chapter 1, doesn't do that. You can just keep exploring and exploring and exploring and never find what you're looking for. Hmm, actually, that endless exploration doesn't sound like a bad thing, but trust me. It is.\n\nThis is further made worse by the near-USELESS map. A good Metroidvania, when you run into something you can't access yet, will mark it on your map. Either with an icon or with a clear lack of a wall on your map. This game? You come into a room from below. You can clearly see that there's an exit to the left, but you can't clear the obstacle. Okay, fair enough. There's clearly a path upwards, but you can't reach that. Okay, fair enough. Proceed to the right. What does the map say about the previous room? NOTHING. It's JUST A SQUARE, with no indication that the room connects to left and up as well. Later, when you get a jumping upgrade for example, you go "hmm, where was that room again..." and YOU CAN'T FIND IT. Since the map DOESN'T FREAKING TELL YOU.\n\nSo yeah, the Metroidvania portion of the game is largely made out of fail. What about Bullet Hells then?\n\nWell, the game doesn't tell you where your hitbox is. Obviously, over a long course of time, you'll get a grasp of where it is, but... WHY NOT JUST TELL THE PLAYER?! Also, the precision movement button is the same as your attack button, which has a couple of frames of attack swing animation... why not allow this to be bound to a key with no other function? And why does this precision movement not apply when you're jumping? Because you WILL need to jump a lot, this isn't a game where you have 8 directional movement available.\n\nThere is a ton of bosses and they are highly varied and unique, each with a TON of different attack patterns. That part is certainly well made.\n\nThe bosses past the first few are pretty darn difficult though, so unless you're good at Bullet Hells, you don't really have any business outside of Casual difficulty. Speaking of difficulties, the game offers Casual, Normal, Hard, Hell and Bunny Extinction. If you're the type of player who likes to challenge themselves and feels good about finally beating a boss after hours of banging your head on it, well, Rabi-Ribi certainly has you covered. I'm not part of that crowd at all though, so the bosses are just frustrating for me. Thank god for CheatEngine.\n\nHonourable design mention about difficulty though... if you die to a boss three times, the game asks if you'd like help. If you say yes, you'll get Halo Boost, granting you -25% damage taken, faster "invulnerability" bomb regen and HP leech. Combined with your pattern experience from those failed attempts, you'll probably beat the boss with ease. The biggest problem is this buff only lasts for a couple of minutes. You'll probably end up with it expiring around 25% boss health, with you at full health (thanks to life leech)... just in time for the boss to unleash their final patterns. Obviously, that tends to be the hardest point of the fight, but at full health you might be fine. And if you're not fine? Attempts 6 and 7 will give you Halo Boost level 2 and 8+ will give you level 3. Level 3 lasts for a VERY LONG TIME and gives MASSIVE buffs, so you shouldn't have any issues with any boss in the game. I give big props to the devs for including a mechanic like this in the game - it stops players from getting stuck at a boss and let's them progress even if they're bad. Oh, and Halo Boost is not available on Hard or above so don't expect to get carried through on any difficulty.\n\nSo... after all that complaining, why am I giving the game a thumbs up? I'm... not sure. But, I do enjoy playing the game a lot (even if I need to load up CheatEngine and find the Health value every single time, I can't be arsed to die to a boss several times for clearing them). There is a couple of good things I should mention:\n\nOnce you've cleared the game and know where the items are, the Metroidvania fail aspect is greatly diminished. Even further if you've stumbled across the "secret techniques" in the first playthrough. These allow you a lot more mobility, and are required if you're going to do a 0% item run. I won't tell them here because... well, if you get used to them, you'll skip a lot. Remember how I said how a good Metroidvania locks you into an area until you find the item to progress? Well, that actually happens in Rabi-Ribi... but ONLY in certain, confined areas. If you know the secret techniques, you can completely skip these actually well designed areas and miss out on vital items. Heck, I did a 0% run and I got so used to using the secret techniques that... well. The first item I went for in a new game was the item which allows you to go into small holes. So, I cleared the area and started to progress in the game and... wait, I can't go into the small holes? But I JUST cleared that ar- oh wait. I was so used to 0% run tactics that I had entirely skipped the segment where that item is. So I had to backtrack to actually get the item I purposedly went after, but had skipped anyway. Yeah, I facepalmed pretty hard after that.\n\nThe game has received a ton of after-launch support from the devs. During the first launch week, the game was updated almost hourly. Bugfixes, new achievements, balance tweaks, performance upgrades. Even months after release, the game is still receiving frequent updates. Actual new content has been fairly sparse, but some include full 0% run (I believe original game only supported half-way 0% run, changing that required a LOT of effort for sure) and three post-game bosses (who absolutely ridiculously hard).\n\nThe soundtrack of the game is pretty damn amazing.\n\ntl;dr; version: A game which is certainly more oriented to the type of people who like Dark Souls types of challenging games, but can be really fun for others as well. The game has some glaring design issues (Metroidvania segments not leading you towards your next required item, massively flawed map, not being able to turn off items after you collect them) but... it can still be a fun.","April 7","true","90.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","2"

The boss battles, however, get challenging and fast-paced over time. It's a great pick-me-up game to play on your down times.\n\nSo far the game itself is very solid and feels pretty polished! I'm glad to say I haven't encountered a single bug. And controlling Erina (the character) feels very responsive. I can say without doubt that the developer put effort into making the game run at a very stable manner on day 1.\n\nI may edit this review at a later time as I experience the game more but as of currently. It's a very solid day 1 release without any apparent bugs. It's a shame larger AAA companies fail to produce fully functional games nowadays without requiring subsequent patches.\n\nI got the UPRPRC Edition to support the devs more and to encourage more games like this. Am eagerly waiting for the digital art book too!\n\nIf I'm to nitpick on things it lacks, it's support for the d-pad in the controller and the lack of a dialogue text log to view previous conversations. But aside from that, I can't really think of anything else to say to NOT recommend this.\n\nUPDATE: 2016-01-29 10:06pm GMT+8\nThere was a point in the game awhile ago where I thought I was stuck for good since there's no visible way get out of the place I was at and I had no way to pass through the small passageway so I asked on the forums first before editing my review to reflect on it.

Eh.\n\nRabi-Ribi~!After playing for around 4 hours, here's some first impressions:\nPros:\n-Solid platforming and controls. They're pretty tight enough so that you have to be just precise enough to properly move around and dodge the projectiles and other attacks. You're also not super-slow, so not a lot of tedium in traversing.\n-Combat. Aside from the dodging and stuff, fighting is pretty cool. Button mashing won't get you anywhere since there's both a stamina meter and a mana meter which you definitely need to control properly to optimize damage and spacing against bosses and other foes. Also, there's a lot of different magic types to switch around for different situations, such as straight-line, AoE, etc.\n-Soundtrack. Seriously. When it's cutesy and lighthearted, it fits. When it's a kick-hindquarters bossfight, it fits. And it does change depending on the area.\n-The Metroidvania Feel. Large, explorable areas with some places you can't reach until you get a certain upgrade. Finding secrets is also pretty fun and rewarding. There's also Warps, so you don't necessarily have to waste a ton of time backtracking. However, some warps can only be found if you look around closely enough.\n-Bossfights. Pretty much like a Touhou boss. Instead of shoot, dodge, and graze, it's shoot, melee, dodge and it feels more dynamic than just watching pretty bullets fly around and hope you don't get hit and die. Also, the bosses have "spellcards" and their movesets change depending on how much HP they have. Pretty cool.\n\nNeutral/Cons?:\n-Artstyle. Some people may not like the cutesy, pixelated, animu, fanservicey look of it all, but it's not too bad and overboard. Game doesn't exactly take itself seriously, either.\n-Story. At this point, it's not super-engaging to me, but I guess curiosity did get to me since there is a lot of mystery going around in the background. Not sure if I like it or not, though.\n-Difficulty. Well, it's a bullet hell-ish game. I've heard from others that Novice is too easy so I went with Normal. It's a nice blend of difficulty, but it's a bit frustrating. I guess I just have to "git gud?"\n-Unexpected Bosses. To be honest, there -are- savepoints nearby which kind of indicate when a boss is going to happen, but sometimes there isn't and the closest warp is pretty far so you can't prepare very well. Kinda sucks, especially when you just want to progress through an area. I do like it to an extent since it changes up the walk through path, dodge and kill enemies formula a bit.\n\nImpressions Verdict?\n8.5/10.\nSolid platformer, with that good tinge of difficulty that makes you frustrated but ends up being a thing that makes you try harder and keep going. Price seems to be a little steep, but I didn't find it to be too much for the enjoyment I'm getting.\nStill, try getting it on a sale.\nVery fun, definitely a recommendation in my book.","January 31","true","6.6"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","0"

It's long, too, and full to the brim with content; I put 24 hours into it just beating the main story, and there's loads and loads of postgame stuff. It's designed to be replayed, speedrunned, sequence broken, and completed with 0% items. The "artbook" contains hours of playable deleted content. The game has hundreds of achievements, including one for beating each boss without taking damage, and the bosses are all carefully designed that this is totally doable. I'm not a huge Bullet Hell fan and I managed to mash my way through Normal Mode, which is actually quite challenging—I died a lot.\n\nThe bosses scale with your "level" (the number of items you have). Level scaling is frequently misused, and most games that have it are worse for it, but here it is implemented correctly, and is a really smart gameplay decision. Though bosses get stronger when you pick up items, they grow slower than you do. So, you can still go collecting items to make the game easier, but it makes clearing the game with 0% not impossible while simultaneously making clearing the game with 100% not trivial. Very good game balance in a genre where the existence of hidden items all over the place usually completely wrecks it.\n\nIf this game has any drawbacks, it's the character designs—every named character in this game is a beautiful anime girl, most of them dressed provocatively. I might have appreciated it in my teenage years, but I'm at a point in my life where it's a turnoff. I don't want to be seen playing this game (which is why I went offline on Steam every time I did) because I don't want to explain, oh no no, it's actually a really good game. Of course, if you DO like anime girls, I recommend this game without reservation. You'll love it through and through.\n\nThere's a few other minor annoyances, but nothing worth complaining too hard about.","April 11","true","23.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

I decided to give it a shot.\n\nAnd i am extremely glad that i did.\nIt is without a doubt in my mind,  Easily  one of the best Metrodivania style games, that I've had the pleasure of playing, in quite some time.\n\n\nGameplay:\nRabi-Ribi's Gameplay is Definitely its strongest point. Movement feels very tight, and you have a lot of control over your character. With the amount of options that you have, It feels extremely satisfying when you learn how to perfectly dodge all of the attacks in a bosses pattern.\n\nSpeaking of bosses. They're all great, and incredibly fun to fight. Each one unique and\nchallenging in their own way.\n\nThe amount of variety is almost Shocking. With more then 40+ boss fights,\nthat also obtain new, stronger attacks the higher your difficulty setting.\nYou'll pretty much always have a new Challenge to look forward to.\n\nThe Game controls very well on a 360 Controller. I don't have an opinion on the\nKeyboard controls, as i haven't used them.\n\n\nMusic:\nI personally found the soundtrack to be extremely good. Most of the time.\nThere was a couple of songs, here and there, that seemed somewhat out of place.\nBut that might just be my opinion.\n\n\nStory:\nI thought that it was quite Cute, Charming, and also pretty intriguing.\n\nIt has quite a bit of depth as well. And it'll require a bit of thinking\nonce you reach the end, In order to figure everything out.\n\n\nPlaytime:\nMy first Playthrough of the game took about, 15 hours.\n\nMy Total Playtime (as of posting this review.) Is around, 25-30 hours\n\n(In regards to my steam playtime. My first Playthrough of the game was on a friends PC.)\n\n\nOverall:\nRabi-Ribi is definitely one of the funnest games that I've played in the past few years. And with a huge amount of Replay value to boot, I highly recommend that you give it a shot.","February 23","true","15.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maestrokenteko/recommended/400910/","maestrokenteko","Maestro Kenteko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maestrokenteko/","284 products in account","Five parts metroivania, five parts bullet hell, ten parts fanservice is the simple formula for Rabi-Ribi. Possessing an almost quaint and innocent charm, Rabi-Ribi tells the story of a bunny turned into a girl in a world populated (almost) entirely by females. Explore a fairly large map, just about the size of one of the castles of Symphony of the Night, and revel in a game that allows you to do any and all things: Including beating the game without getting items!\n\nAt its core, Rabi-Ribi is a celebration of the classic Metroidvania item turned on its head. Taking many conventional platforming and exploration tropes, Rabi-Ribi is first and foremost more akin to a bullet hell then a bog standard Metroidvania. This distinction creates a very different feel then most of the genre, as it's focus is as much on dodging as it is on getting things done. Bosses are scalar, meaning that all exploring will do is reward you with a larger toolkit. This may be a mark on it, but the beauty of the game and its focus on non linear gameplay ensures that any boss can be a challenge regardless of the items at your disposal.\n\nCharacter wise, the main focus is on Erina (the rabbit girl) and her companion Ribbon. Much of the characterization comes from how she and Ribbon interact with a large cast of diverse characters (granted, all scantily clad women) but slowly creates and shows the feeling of a specific character. While the story is arguably minor, it's much more appropriate to label this as a "slice of life" or "character driven" game, even though there is an overarching goal. Many NPCs have non romantic relationships with other NPCs and, barring one pair who are all but a couple (plus a succubus), there is an overall sense of celebrating a friendship. The art style of the game reinforces a large amount of the writing, with very cute and endearing chibi sprites mixed in with the very fanservice oriented portraits. Each character has a different feel simply due to their costume and interactions, along with their sprites and the writing.\n\nIn terms of replayability, the game excels. There are many differing ways to go at the game, from a speedrun driven mode to the aforementioned no item run to the throw caution to the wind and completely break the story of the game run. Assisting the freedom of exploration is the fact that many base moves are able to be done out of the box, instead requiring different tricks which reward those looking for a challenge. Because of this, and incredibly strong level design, you have a game where you can access virtually everywhere with a minimal amount of skills, truly testing your exploration skills (barring the use of a guide).\n\nAll in all, Rabi-Ribi is a delighful interpretation of a fairly beloved genre. If you prefer a more dodge focused or "dance" kind of gameplay in your Metroidvania, or just want to enjoy a cute and fun story and all the fanservice it brings, pick this game up. The DLC even allows you to do one of the modes, boss run, with other characters! Definitely worthwhile and enjoyable for fans of the genre and just as worthwhile for those looking to break into it!","May 27","true","20.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I saw this game quite a few times in my Steam recommendations before actually buying it. And well, not wanting to sound rude towards other "anime games" you usually read stuff like "It has anime boobs 10/10" so I didn't check the reviews when it said "Overwhelmingly positive."\n\nUntil that one day: and all reviews came up with: "Ignore the super cutesy appeal, it's a great platformer"\n\nAnd this is simply what I can only fully agree with: the game is a 2D platformer - combined with Touhou like bullet hell battles - and those battles get extremely hard over time. I just saw the credits for the first time (apparently there will be quite a bit of post game content which I haven't explored yet) and boy - I was playing on "Novice" difficulty and the bosses were giving me a really hard time. I'm not saying the game's unfair:it never is. The controls work perfectly fine, they're super responsive - just make sure to get a controller to play this - in my case I remapped the buttons. But yeah, the controls and everything working just great made me never blame the game if I died (and it happened quite often).\n\nOther than that: If the cutesy appeal would turn you off - then you'll be certainly missing out on a great and challenging platformer.\n\nThe story might be a bit absurd to be frank - a bunny gets transformed into a girl and she searches for her master. And as the story progresses she searches for her master's younger sister.\nSounds simple? Well, maybe! But all the characters in the game have a little trait - there are very many so don't expect them to be super deep but they're very charming.\n\nSo  well: I recommend it!","June 3","true","15.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This is a Doujin-Metroidvania-2D-platformer with bullet-hell bosses. And while this game doesn't bring anything new to the genre (lets be honest here, we have seen exactly this gameplay a gazillion times before), everything Rabi-Ribi does, it does right.\n\nMost importantly, the controls feel awesome. Unlike "Bunny must Die!" for example, the controls aren't rocket-science and you feel right at home from the beginning. However, if you want to use a pad instead of a keyboard, do not use the original 360-controller. The D-Pad sucks and it always will. And it will ♥♥♥♥ you over. Use a playstation controller with a converter or go for a razer sabretooth instead or use ABSOLUTELY ANYTHING ELSE.\n\nThe gameplay is just as you'd expect from this kind of game. You punch and shoot cute things until you reach a boss and here is when the true game starts: There's a ♥♥♥♥-ton of bosses in Rabi-Ribi and the battles are all extremely well made. You dodge 100s of bullets until the boss calms down for a second and you can get a combo in. The battles feel almost turn-based actually.\n\nThe bullet-patterns are the heart of the bossfights and the further you get into the game the more original will the fights become.\n\nThe map-exploration is done extremely well. There are a ton of power-ups hidden in explodable or fake walls and if you get stuck in a hard bossfight, go somewhere else for now. The gameplay is as non-linear as it gets, the map is huge and there are always a few places you haven't been to or hidden power-ups you haven't found. Enemies and bosses also drop money, so you can buy even more stuff from the shop, or NPCs etc.\n\nThe soundtrack is great, specially during boss-battles. Here is how this game sounds:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bT-jEcAoE8\n\nReplayabilty is there too. Many different difficulties, boss-rush and speedrun-mode. Also an alternate way to play the game (check out the guides-section and the achievements).\n\nThe story however, sucks. It's nonsensical and also not really funny. There are way too many cutscenes and way too many words that don't say anything at all. However, entire scenes can be skipped easily, so that isn't really a problem. You can always look in the menu where you have to go next.\n\nIs it worth the 17€ that it costs at the moment? Absolutely.\n\nIn a sale this will be a steal.","February 7","true","37.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I bought this game almost out of a whim and also thanks to LewdGamers review on the title. Rabi-Ribi is a fun mix of "Metroidvania" ( i like to call it Bunny-vania) with a bit of intense bullet-hell action. You control main protagonist, Erina. A rabbit who gets transfromed into a bunny girl who's in search of her master while pushing her way through the strange, vast world that she's in. Along the way she fights off against the world's hostile creatures and thirsty bunny fangirl fanatics with a piko hammer and a fairy named Ribbon who travels with Erina.\n\nPros:\n\n-Cute 2D Character sprites\n-The non-linear world of Rabi-Rabi Island is surprisingly big and the areas are well varied\n-Boss fights are fun will test your bullet-hell dodging skills\n-Music fits well with much of the game\n-16-20+ Hour playthough\n-Plenty of replayability even after clearing the game: Boss Rush, Speedrun mode, trying to get 100% on areas and items, Boss fight rankings, difficulty modes\n-LOTS of achievements and trading cards to collect for all of you game achievement and steam card hunters!\n\n\nCons:\n\n-When pausing the game, FPS seems to drop between high 40s to low 50s on a toaster rig I played on.\n-Not a clear indication of how the areas connect to each other\n-Minor Spelling errors ( though might of been fixed with updates)\n-A number of boss fights are repeated late in the game, though they do mix things up with buffs/debuffs\n-Outside of Erina's strange transformation and Rabi Rabi Island, the overall story feels inconsistant at times\n\n\n\nOverall: Thumbs up! It's almost criminal how Rabi-Ribi fell under the radar. Do not be fooled by this games bright, cute and even mildly suggestive appearance. There's penty to do and explore in Rabi Rabi Island with intense bullet-hell action that well justifies the game at its $18 full price. I easily reccoment this game who are looking for a different spin on their non-linear action-platformers mixed with some bullet hell action and like cute bunny girls welding a piko hammer.","February 11","true","34.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The jump controls in the game were excellent which is key in these types of games being pressure sensitive, meaning the longer you push the button the higher you go.\n\nThe story has a light tone to it with an anime style feel to it, doesn't seem exceptionally deep but that's not a bad thing.\n\nI have enjoyed my experience with the game, so give it a look if your into these styles of game and keep it on the radar","January 30","true","14.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Nothing super depressing or anything like that. Erina, the main character, is awesome too. Can't hate her, optimistic attitude, but not stupidly headstrong in the slightest. A bunch of side characters each with their own personalities and little kinks as well (Cocoa is my favorite). Dialogue and CGs included too. The length of the game is reasonable for the price as well.\n\nGameplay:\nThere's a map, badges, upgrades, and of course crazy strong/fun bosses. Hidden upgrades scattered around, findable with or without the radar. Nothing is completely unfair, everything can be dodged with some skill and practice. As with other bullet hell games, your hitbox is incredibly small. Two main ways to deal damage are with Ribbon (fairy friend) shooting magic and Erina with her melee hammer attacks. Combat feels enjoyable, plenty of combos, and nice combo meter to make you want to avoid getting hit.\n\nSound:\nGet the soundtrack, amazing ost.\n\nIf you enjoy metroidvania type games with some serious challenge and don't mind the anime art style, get this along with the OST, don't take another minute to think about it.","February 20","true","38.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You play as a psychopathic amnesiac, 5% bunny 95% girl with Stockholm’s syndrome named Erina. You join her on a murderous rampage through a forest filled with peaceful woodland creatures with Shadow of the Colossus like efficiency. The “artful” character models used during the lengthily dialogue sequences are almost enough to distract you form a plot so thin, it could win America’s next top model. Besides ridiculous dialogue sequences that substitute brevity for intrigue, the game has tons of upgrades that will no doubt have you backtracking through the basic and boring zones in search of that one HP+ upgrade you missed because you didn’t have the “Super Triple Mega Lightning Double Wall Carrot Jump ™ © 2016”.\n\nAll that being said, it is a fun and simple game. Rabi-Ribi tries to cram in upgrades as a substitute for complexity and just winds up feeling more like a distraction than a truly engaging experience. You can tell there is something going on in the story but the character’s unwillingness to discuss important topics leaves you reading tons of “filler” dialogue that make you wonder “ Why the hell am I reading all of this?”. Ultimately Rabi-Ribi is a metaphor for life itself, the enjoyment you get out of it is equal to what you put in, with a ton of boredom, frustration, pantsless girls and masculin fairies in the middle.\n\nCheck out our let's play, Now with voice acting... kinda.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSncIbrQAnUWRGCmwi7-3dpygpuaZcmms","February 23","true","31.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And that's not a bad thing.\nAfter looking into the gameplay of Rabi Ribi, I found that it had some of my favorite game genres mixed together:\nA Metroidvanian 2D sidescroller.\nTouhou-esque bullet hell battles.\nA bunch moe animu girlies.\nHas a JRPG feel.\n\nIf you like hard games and/or are a fan of Touhou or just anime in general, I really recommend giving this game a shot. It doesn't matter if you suck at bullet hells, since this game is forgiving in the fact that the game will give you buffs if you die enough times and agree to let it help you. For those who are more hardcore, you will find that this game in my opinion, rivals the difficulty to that of Wings of Vi. Please spread the word about this game! I feel that it really deserves a spot in one of the best anime games on Steam to date.\n\nHere are the pros & cons:\n- Pros:\nGreat anime artstyle, pixel sprites, CG art, and a sleek UI.\nFun gameplay with pretty good level design. I found myself trying to blow up every wall for secret items or paths like in Dark Souls.\nReally nice OST. I really appreciate games with good soundtracks since they are more memorable that way and give you a more immersive experience.\nForgiving. If you are struggling and die a lot, the game will give you a damage reduction buff and various others if you agree to the prompt following your death.\nIt has replayability. There are different modes and challenges to try such as Boss Rush.\nMostly bug free. I haven't found any major bugs and have only crashed once during a boss fight. I'm not sure why but hey, it happens. The developer updates frequently too.\nNon-linear. You do have to follow the storyline and some areas are barred off due to it until you progress, BUT you can pretty much go to any area you want and fight the bosses at most of them. I found myself going to the final area by accident and had a fun time trying to get out of there, lol.\nIt has a good amount of content for the price; one playthrough will probably net you about 20hrs or more of game time. Being one who kind of likes to hang on to their money until a big sale, I actually found that this game was worth the price, especially on the 10% off sale. If you get it for cheap then it's a steal.\nGood KB controls and controller compatible. The controls can even be changed if the vanilla setup isn't comfortable. For me I had to swap X and C since jumping with X and hitting with C feels more comfortable for me.\nLots of cute achievements and badge content (backgrounds/icons/etc).\nLolis and a bunny girl.\n\n- Cons:\nMay cause seizures for those who are seizure prone. It may also cause a hole in your monitor for those who are anger prone.\nNot much of a storyline. I feel that it's kind of weak and repetitive in some parts of the game. I'm not saying it was a bad story for what it has though. I really enjoyed it.\nThere aren't any other real cons aside from a just small gripe I have where the difficulty on some bosses can be extreme at times compared to others. I guess I'm just not MLG enough for bullet hells.\n\nSo yeah, that's my review. If you bothered to get this far, then I hope you'll consider Rabi Ribi if you don't own it already.\n\n\n\n\n\nP.S: Cicini is best Shimakaze. :D","February 20","true","30.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ZelosZalis/recommended/400910/","ZelosZalis","ZelosZalis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ZelosZalis/","794 products in account","This game was an amazing surprise and a game that makes me lament missing its crowdfunding.\n\nFor the short explanation of the game its a mix of platforming and Danmaku (Bullet Hell) shoot em ups, the nearest comparison I can give game play wise is a Touhou fan game series by the name of Koumajou Densetsu. The danmaku really comes out during boss fights which makes bosses very fun to fight each also coming with their own desperation moves which are similar to Touhou's "spell cards".\n\nThe platforming aspect of the game is also not lacking, while many of the games early enemies are throw away, there are still difficult non boss areas of the game that challenge a player's platforming skills. The game boasts a "metroidvania" style to its gameplay which allows a player outside of minor path forcing here and there to tackle the game in any order they wish. The level of thought they put into allowing the non linear approach was amazing, even allowing 0% item runs if you know the game and your skills well enough.\n\nLastly I want to discuss the cast and plot, which may come off weak in some areas. The overall plot itself without giving away spoilers... lets just say it kinda leaves some gaps in as to what happened, letting the player kinda decide for themselves which bugs me but its not all that horrible, its more of a minor personal gripe. Outside of the story the characters themselves are cute and quirky, many characters are parodies of famous anime and story characters from other series, but keep enough of their own charm to not be lame copies. I almost think of an old game from JAST called Season of Sakura for this, every single character was inspired from famous anime characters of the time yet they still were all their own characters at the same time.\n\nIn all this is a game that is deceptive, its a fun and amazingly challenging platformer hiding under a layer of cute, if cute doesn't bug you, give this game a shot. If you love cute, this game will be match made in heaven.\n\nOne last thing, part of what is making this game so great is the amazing amount of post release support the game is getting, even as I write this they are still adding content and fixing bugs. Simply amazing.","March 31","true","78.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I bought this game mostly on the preface that it is in the anime category and it was more action oriented. While I do play a lot of the dating sims on Steam, this kind of has the look and feel of a weird hybrid. The action is great and it's fun to learn to control the two very different characters. The artwork and deluxe edition are also worth the money and this is an indie title that is well deserving of the investment of time. I really like a lot of the characters and the dialogues and I love the world they live in and how fun it is to look at.\n\nHowever, I do have a few negatives..but they do not really take away from the enjoyment of this game. The story is a bit silly, over-the-top and kind of weak, but I have yet to finish it. Do not go into Rabi-Ribi expecting a dead-out serious ride with lots of lore, it's supposed to be kind of fantasy/out there and I can see past that and a few character discrepancies.\n\nI also do not feel like a lot of the game directs you on where to go if you are a beginner, I'm still kind of early on and sometimes I just do not know how to reach certain areas to progress. It's very much a sit-down and figure it out game, I found the tutorials kind of lacking in a few areas.\n\nBut I think the pro to this idea is that you will not run out of things to do before clocking a lot of hours in this charming game and it does take you back to the days when you really had to work at and master a title while completing it.","April 3","true","35.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But with how much I love this game, there is a few big complaints. To start off, some of the abilities that you get are kinda useless and I never used more than when required. While the controls feel tight sometimes I will try to perform a move but be blocked because I didn't hold up and instead held slightly left and up. I also hated that what is suppose to be a secret hidden area that you can only get to in one part of the game is REQUIRED for 100% the map. Sure, I can go back and get it after the game has been completed, but even then I have to play another 3 hours just to get back to the area.Then there is the main two reasons I am writing this review. First is the items. They are scattered around the map and hidden quite well. I had lots of fun finding most of them and some were actually good puzzles, but then I found myself missing about 4 items per area. I had to go through each area and just keep dropping bombs until something blew up and showed an item hidden in a place with no hints and no tells. It felt like I was playing the original LoZ trying to find secrets, and it was irritating.The ending area and boss is obnoxious, with the ending area besically requiring you to wait for your amulet to recharge, and while the platforming is fine in the area, I found myself grinding for health to make sure I didn't die to the rediculous spikes. Also the final boss can be crazy. In my case I would have been done with the game in 40 hours if it wasn't for that boss. It was a 20 minute fight for me and the sustain you have to have in the fight is rediculous. With all this said though, I would still recomend the game. Expecially if you are a fan of Touhou or any metroidvania style games.\n\n\nSorry for the rant this is a good game buy it.","March 22","true","47.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The danmaku really comes out during boss fights which makes bosses very fun to fight each also coming with their own desperation moves which are similar to Touhou's "spell cards".\n\nThe platforming aspect of the game is also not lacking, while many of the games early enemies are throw away, there are still difficult non boss areas of the game that challenge a player's platforming skills. The game boasts a "metroidvania" style to its gameplay which allows a player outside of minor path forcing here and there to tackle the game in any order they wish. The level of thought they put into allowing the non linear approach was amazing, even allowing 0% item runs if you know the game and your skills well enough.\n\nLastly I want to discuss the cast and plot, which may come off weak in some areas. The overall plot itself without giving away spoilers... lets just say it kinda leaves some gaps in as to what happened, letting the player kinda decide for themselves which bugs me but its not all that horrible, its more of a minor personal gripe. Outside of the story the characters themselves are cute and quirky, many characters are parodies of famous anime and story characters from other series, but keep enough of their own charm to not be lame copies. I almost think of an old game from JAST called Season of Sakura for this, every single character was inspired from famous anime characters of the time yet they still were all their own characters at the same time.\n\nIn all this is a game that is deceptive, its a fun and amazingly challenging platformer hiding under a layer of cute, if cute doesn't bug you, give this game a shot. If you love cute, this game will be match made in heaven.\n\nOne last thing, part of what is making this game so great is the amazing amount of post release support the game is getting, even as I write this they are still adding content and fixing bugs. Simply amazing.","March 31","true","78.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has nothing to do with what makes the game shine... that being the gameplay. Rabi-Ribi takes elements from beat-em-ups, metroid, and castlevania games, pushing it all inside a neat box. You gain powerups as you progress, allowing you more means of beating up enemies. Honestly, it would just take too long to list everything as much as I'd want to.\n\nThis game excels at what it's trying to be gameplay wise and because of that, it's a friggen blast to play.","April 25","true","36.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Then I moved to novice at which point the post game started kicking me my butt till no end. Finally I settled on casual, and I think I still lost maybe once to a boss before the end. The integration of the "bullet-hell" genre with metroidvania ensures that Rabi-Ribi will only appeal to the most hardcore gamer at the end of the day.\n\nLevel design, pacing, art style are solid across the board, the platforming is a little wonky. Animations are top notch sprite work. Overall if you're looking for something to plod through after work like me, keep it at novice/casual. If you want to go deep into it there is more than enough here to keep a hardcore gamer occupied.\n\nCons, kinda samey, each level is a re-tile with no variation on the actual elements. Anime plot/dialogue is forgettable. Grinding bosses to learn patters just to squeak out a win with <10 HP left gets mind-numbing tedious.\n\nOverall a solid play,","May 26","true","20.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is very kind of the devs to put their mascot character in one of the area that can help you change your difficulty, and after a few repeated defeats the game will offer you a free defence buff before you walk into slaugher again. In my personal experience by mid game one average boss cost me at least 7-8 tries to barely get through, with all the buffs the devs have pitied me with at that.\none awesome point is that you may accidentally venture into a mid-game or even end game level without knowing it, the map is that interconnected and free. Enemies and their attacks come in amazing variety, and some platforming will have you swear your tongue off.\nBut overall the game is so bubbly and well made, even the bosses' barrages are so creative, they will make you awe as your hands go numb from the adrenaline and frustration, make you smile as you curse the bloody devil who designed the patterns.\nArrrrgh!

Suits both casuls looking for an enjoyable experience and hardcore players alike.\n\nGameplay wise, the game has hit the spot. The platforming is done exceptionally well, which is quite important considering the fact that its what you will be doing most of the time. The bullet hell aspect of the game makes the game a challenge. However, the developers provide sufficient tools for the player to overcome this difficulty in the form of platforming skills and offensive capabilities, therefore making the game an enjoyable experience while at the same time rewarding effort and skill.\n\nThe atmosphere of the game in really fits the general setting. Colours are used beautifully to express the personalities of various characters as well as depict mood, a specific detail which I appreciate. Excellent soundtrack is used to amplify the character of already beautifully designed environments, providing personality to the world. The artstyle is reminiscent of Japanese manga and anime, which makes the artwork and cutscenes a real eye candy.\n\nStorywise this game is not that strong. Its a typical "save the princess stuck in another world" storyline with tons of moe and a hint of tragedy that has yet to be properly and fully expressed. Real wasted opportunity there. But honestly, most of us are here for the anime gurls (me included), so it doesn't really matter.\n\nAlso. CUTE GRILLS.\n\nOverall it's a good game at its price level.

Huge map with many tiny details, with quite a potential for sequence breaking, good controls, awesome and difficult (at least on the setting I played) boss fights, beautiful OST, pretty pixel-art graphics.

It's like if you took the combat system of Megaman Zero, the the item collection and area   traversement of Metroid, a good dose of bullet hell and SNES worthy difficulty and blended it all together. The controls feel really smooth and nice and I recommend getting a controller to fully experience the greatness of the game. The visuals also look quite nice, the mix of chibi, anime and pixel art all create a cheerful and light atmosphere that the game backs up with a great sound track, and the game devs acually care about the game which is nice to see. Just play the game and buy the UPRPRC (Usagi Pero-Pero Club) Edition, trust me it's worth it for 27.99 and if it's too expensive just get it during a sale because this game absolutely needs to be played.","May 15","true","22.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Combat: okay, bosses: good: story: bad.\n\nI bought this game in the sale of 2016 for anime style games and I don't think even then that it was partiularly cheap. I went on a hunch - buyer beware. I found it wasn't for me, however let me say on the positive side that, for an indy game, it's got a good amount of polish and doesn't feel cheap, nor did I run into any major bugs.\n\nIt's a 2D Metroidvania game about a bunny girl. Was she a bunny before the start of the adventure? I think so. Does the dialogue encourage you to care? It certainly does not - in fact the story, the characters and the dialogue is the thing that really brings this game down for me. I found myself skipping dialogue boxes frequently - and I almost never do that. I like a good story!\n\nLet's skip that part for a moment and discuss the game itself. You jump around, you hit things and you explore. Like a Metroidvania, you have options about where you go and in which order you tackle bosses. There are hidden items around and lots of places to explore. As you fight your abilities will upgrade and you will gain more powerful attacks and other upgrades. There are a variety of enemies to kill and the bosses, well, I'll talk about those shortly.\n\nSo the general part of the game, not including the bosses or the story, was alright. Decent. Maybe even pretty good at times. An okay version of ideas and concepts done better in other places. The combat is reasonably interesting and the upgrades keep you going. What upgrade is next?\n\nThe bosses are the game's high point. I had fun with those, and found myself wishing more of the game was like that. They mix a bullet hell style to jazz things up and it works well.\n\nSomeone put a lot of effort into this game, but not all of it paid off. Whoever wrote the story wants to watch less bottom of the barrel anime shows and learn how to condense 25 lines of exposition into five. And 'oh, that person looked troubled when they have to leave quickly. Doesn't that make you interested in why they left?' only works if the character is remotely interesting, and even then I wouldn't use it as your staple. It's average, bordering on good at times. A good game is in there somewhere, trying to get to the surface, but its pacing keeps getting destroyed by the 'story'.","April 30","false","1.2"," 5 of 33 people (15%) found this review helpful","15","5","33","0","1"

Wait...story? what story? Its so linear, full of non sense/generic dialogues. dunno, a story of a bunny that magically turns into a sexy dressed girl... cmon guys, you could do it better. Ive played hentais with more lore than this.\n\nthe general impression of the game is that i felt you developers just rushed the process and made everything quickly without too many feedback and self criticism.\n\nI just requested a refund, sorry. The idea its great, the "danmaku" system is good. but you sould worked a bit more on the points i just mentioned... or simply have charged 5-7 usd for the game. because for the quality, that price would be better.\n\ncheers.","March 5","false","0.2"," 9 of 97 people (9%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","9","9","97","2","0"

All in all, enjoyable gameplay. Feels really satisfying when you get those combos. The story is a bit wack, however in the end I suppose it compliments the whole naive and clueless (in a cute way!) atmosphere the main character has.\n\nGraphics: 9/10\n\nOne of the main selling points of the game in my opinion. Graphic style is very appealing, cute and lively. The character portraits are quite nice as well.\n\nMusic: 8/10\n\nHaven't really heard anything stellar yet, but that's just personal taste. All in all the soundtrack is nice, but I hope things become a bit more memorable later in the game. I would put a 7 here, but I want to give it the benefit of the doubt.\n\nPerformance: 9/10\n\nResolution seems a bit strange at times, however besides that small complaint I'm happy to find this game running really smooth. Nothing worse than buying a new game that's poorly optimized, not the case here though!\n\nIn conclusion, Rabi-Ribi shows a lot of promise from it's first few levels.

I didn't know anything about this going in and just expected a short bout of fanservice.\n\nWhat I found instead was a fairly large Metroidvania game with interesting combat and level design...and really tight bullet-hell boss fights. That shouldn't scare you off--I'm not great at bullet hell games, but on Novice level, the game is really forgiving. Especially if you go on the usual Metroidvaniaesque hunt for character upgrades. The soundtrack is amazing.\n\nThe story is mostly nonsensical, but that's forgivable since it's just a paper thin excuse for there to be a bunch of bunnygirls. The only thing I'd call out as bad is that the game has issues with intermitent slowdowns. My battlestation has a recent i7 and and GTX 780 Ti and I was still seeing hickups in some areas.","April 6","true","39.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While boss fights are pretty much bullet hell type bosses they are all beatable with practice constent tries. Easily the most enjoyable part is keeping up the combo meter to max which means attacking the boss while also dodging bullets and not getting hit.\n\nThe best part really is how open the game is. The game is designed to the point where you can beat the game the default way with collecting power ups as you explore and 0% where you can go the whole game with no items collected.\n\nThe boss battles are amazing in this game while the patterns for some of the bullets are the same at times they'll change and even the order in which they are used are different also the higher the boss' level is the more different attacks they'll use. Some of the bosses are well designed in terms of gimmicks and abilites they may have, the first early post game boss will easily show you what I mean.\n\nThe Soundtrack for this game is surprisingly amazing, a lot of the locations have nice music and the boss musics are very very well done. (I really love 2nd and 3rd Final boss themes)\n\nWhat really pulled me in is how well the sprites were done and how detailed some were.\n\nEasily worth the full price, took me around 50 hours just to 100% the whole game on hard for my first run. If you have the money I'd recommend the UPRPRC Edition the soundtrack being  so good and the artbook actually has some playable beta content.\n\n(Side Note: I really wish there was a vita port of this seems like it would fit so well on it.)\n(PS: I have a thing for bunny girl costumes now)","April 7","true","79.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Most people will probably pass it up just based on that, but I wouldn’t be too hasty.\n\nRabi-Rabi doesn’t take itself seriously at all. Characters fight for no reason, the world is almost exclusively inhabited by cute girls, and the rest should be pretty obvious. I found this really refreshing. Every now and then, it’s fun to play a game that knows it’s a game, and just doesn’t care. I mean it really doesn’t care at all.\n\nThe character’s are all utterly absurd. There is a scientist girl that literally just wears a short lab coat over a bikini, and I think that’s the point where I started to lose myself, I couldn’t help but laugh when I saw her. There were a few points were I let out an audible “awwww”, everything is so cute!\n\nThe strangest thing is that the game is actually good. I saw Rabi-Ribi on the new realeases list and clicked on it out of morbid curiosity, only to find that it had really good reviews. I couldn’t believe my eyes, how could something this rediculous actually be good? Have I stumbled into some alternate dimension where dreams really can come true? I suppose I’ll never truly know.\n\nRabi-Ribi is a metroidvania game, with brawler style combat, mixed with bullet-hell. I’m sure there are other games like this, but I’ve never played any of them. It took a while for me to get used to it, but man, is it fun! I started out on hard mode, because I figured “It’s got a bunny girl in it, how hard could it be?”. Hard. You have to be very careful to save often, and not explore too far, or else you’ll die and lose your progress, which is very frustrating.\n\nFor me, this game is all about the boss fights. It has twenty-four in total. If you enjoy bullet-hells these fights will scratch your itch, and the extra brawling/platforming element gives it a unique flavor. I’d say Rabi-Ribi is worth picking up just for these fights. They’re painfully difficult though, so if you’re not confident, please don’t choose hard mode, please. By the way, there is also an unlockable Hell mode, and Bunny Extinction mode. I haven’t played these yet, but I can only imagine what they must be like.\n\nThere is a surprising amount of RPG-style uprgrades for your character. Every stat, every move, it can all be improved with some sort of item. Some of these are bought, and some are found hidden throughout the game. The game branches out after a while, letting you explore areas in whatever order you want. You have a lot of freedom.\n\nAs usual, I’m going to mention the soundtrack. It has a lot of cutesy stuff in it, but it has a good range of sounds if you’re not into that. The whole album is good, but I love the boss music. There’s one track that sounds very reminiscent of something FF6. For some reason, it only let’s you download FLAC’s. They’ve added .oggs recently, but it still seems really weird that they wouldn’t include MP3s. You’ll have to convert them yourself, if you want them.\n\nThis game is far better than it ever should have been, but I thought the absurdity of it all just made it that much better. If you’re even mildly interested in this one, I would definitely recommend you try it. I think I’m a little obsessed with it.\n\nISH SO CUUUUTE!!","February 14","true","14.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's as crazy as it sounds and it's an astonishing amount of fun. The aesthetic is like if you were eating chocolate cupcake with sprinkles while riding a unicorn on a rainbow to a sea of kittens and bunnies.\n\nCombat is tight and you'll be dodge-duck-dip-dive-dodging everywhere. Platforming feels great and the curve in terms of given power and difficulty constantly challenges without ever making you feel like you are forced to fight out of your league. Lots of motivation to explore with the power ups and badges hidden around. I love that the story utilizes it's aesthetic angle to provide loads of satire towards the anime/cosplay community, it helps keep the game from going overboard on the cringe and I got invested in the atmosphere of the game because it has a sense of self awareness.\n\nOnly complaints are that SP can make your combat ability feel a bit too limiting at times when this game already has a large emphasis on "Attack whenever you have an opening because there aren't many" which can interrupt the flow a bit (combat is still fantastic though), and that you run around kinda doing the same fetch "quests" a lot. Story is slow to progress but it holds enough intrigue to keep you motivated to read it.\n\nVery fun game, give it a look if my description sounds interesting.","February 14","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay is rather unique, resembling something like a hack'n'slash in a large game world with plenty of content. The bosses are particularly entertaining, and the structure of the game is almost Touhou-esque, with standard enemies with exploration and platforming mixed in, featuring hazards that can significantly dent your health. On the other end of the spectrum are the bosses. These are generally pretty drawn out fights, featuring a wide variety of pretty looking patterns. Additionally, the game isn't linear, giving you some choice and plenty of exploration options without locking the player in a particular boss or location order. Sequence breaking is a thing, but is restricted only by the items in your possession.\n\nOverall, the game looks great, has a fantastic soundtrack, features unique gameplay elements with varied modes and difficulty settings for more replayability. Definitely worth picking up for those Danmaku fans out there. If you've played Wings of Vi or Fortune Summoners, Rabi-Ribi fits somewhere in between.","February 15","true","18.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've only played about 8 hours at the time of this review, but there's already been at least 10 really interesting bosses that are quite difficult. There's plenty to explore and collect like a metroidvania. The story is pretty weird, and a lot of the bosses just make up excuses to fight you, as the game is very aware that is it a game. I might go back after i (presumable) unlock the harder difficulties and see what that does.

If possible I would put neutral.\n\nAnyway, Rabi Ribi has great gameplay and it's a ton of fun.  It handles really smoothly and you really feel like Erina does what you want her to do, which is great.  The characters are all really cute, albeit generic, and some of the interactions can be really fun.  The soundtrack of the game is also really great and is really fitting and sets the mood for each different fight perfectly, although it would be even better if some of the tracks were a little longer.\n\nNow, on to the cons that make my recommendation neutral instead of the amazingly positive it would otherwise be.  It's worth mentioning that the story isn't very creative or engaging, but with this kind of game that isn't a big deal since it's very gameplay based.  In fact the game itself I'm pretty sure acknowledges this at points and makes a joke here and there about it.  Anyway the real problem is that the game can lag like all hell for no real reason.  I'm running it on a computer that can run games like Dark Souls and Fallout no problem, lag free, but this 2D game will often times run obscenely slow.  It isn't constant, it mainly happens for me only on certain bosses, but it makes those bosses completely unfun and frustrating.  Sometimes the lag can help you slide inbetween the bullets more efficiently, but more often it will just kill you by making you jump the wrong height or something.  Even when the lag DOES help you, it ruins the experience and makes victory feel pretty lame.  All this lag happens on both V.Low and Performance settings graphics.\n\nSince the lag only happens for certain bosses generally, the rest are still extremely fun and so it doesn't take away from the experience as much as it could potentially, but it is still very frustrating.\n\nIf your computer is poor, I definitely wouldn't bother with this game though.","May 23","true","110.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While it does follow the sadly common trope of anime-styled games having mostly females in revealing or skimpy outfits, it doesn't try too hard to show that off. The most you get out of it is character renders and the cutscene stills. Everything else is colorful, innocent fun. Haven't beaten the game yet myself, but the game is pretty plentiful in content if you like long Metroidvanias or general action platformers. It sports plenty of collectibles, great abilities that help in exploration, and challnging boss fights that always change up their attack patterns, which makes them more challenging to beat since you can't predict what they do next.I recommend to any Metroidvania fans.\n\nAlso, I don't usually recommend DLC, but if you end up enjoying this game, I also would like to recommend the artbook. Yes, it has beta and concept artwork, as well as editable character stills, which is all okay, but it also features beta/unreleased game content. Playable characters, unused/scrapped bosses, as well as two new modes of play for the base game: impossible and unknown. Impossible is pretty much what it is on the cover, with enemies doing heaps more damage than usual. I'm not sure how it effects stat growth, as I only played about 3 minutes to see what it was all about, but I imagine that you don't get much in that regard. Unknown I haven't played yet, but I'll update the review when I get to it.

I didn't know anything about this going in and just expected a short bout of fanservice.\n\nWhat I found instead was a fairly large Metroidvania game with interesting combat and level design...and really tight bullet-hell boss fights. That shouldn't scare you off--I'm not great at bullet hell games, but on Novice level, the game is really forgiving. Especially if you go on the usual Metroidvaniaesque hunt for character upgrades. The soundtrack is amazing.\n\nThe story is mostly nonsensical, but that's forgivable since it's just a paper thin excuse for there to be a bunch of bunnygirls. The only thing I'd call out as bad is that the game has issues with intermitent slowdowns.

While boss fights are pretty much bullet hell type bosses they are all beatable with practice constent tries. Easily the most enjoyable part is keeping up the combo meter to max which means attacking the boss while also dodging bullets and not getting hit.\n\nThe best part really is how open the game is. The game is designed to the point where you can beat the game the default way with collecting power ups as you explore and 0% where you can go the whole game with no items collected.\n\nThe boss battles are amazing in this game while the patterns for some of the bullets are the same at times they'll change and even the order in which they are used are different also the higher the boss' level is the more different attacks they'll use. Some of the bosses are well designed in terms of gimmicks and abilites they may have, the first early post game boss will easily show you what I mean.\n\nThe Soundtrack for this game is surprisingly amazing, a lot of the locations have nice music and the boss musics are very very well done. (I really love 2nd and 3rd Final boss themes)\n\nWhat really pulled me in is how well the sprites were done and how detailed some were.\n\nEasily worth the full price, took me around 50 hours just to 100% the whole game on hard for my first run. If you have the money I'd recommend the UPRPRC Edition the soundtrack being  so good and the artbook actually has some playable beta content.\n\n(Side Note: I really wish there was a vita port of this seems like it would fit so well on it.)\n(PS: I have a thing for bunny girl costumes now)","April 7","true","79.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is due to the introduction of clever new mechanics that each add a new layer to the combat.\nThe only reason that I think that someone shouldn't buy this game if they're interested in the genre is the "risque" character art that some have compared to "joke gift weeaboo games" like Huniepop and Sakura Spirit.

The controls are tight and responsive. The developers obviously had an attention to detail that most other developers sorely lack these days and it's amazing just how well Rabi-Ribi is put together, with so much content, varied modes and difficulties.

The Characters are great, the world is colorful, theres alot to do and different modes to play.  Now with that said, lets get started with this review.\n\nThe Plot\nThe game starts off in a mysterious place where the Main Character is in a unfamiliar place, then suddenly meets a shadow figure. Next thing she wakes up into a world full of adventure, secrets, and challenges. From there you'll eventually go to a Certain Town, which will pretty much be your HUB of the game. Think of that as your base of operations; stock up on materials from the shop, get buffs, etc etc.\n\nThe Gameplay/Mechanics\nRabi-Ribi is a bullet Hell. So expect the game to get harder and harder as you venture deeper into the game. With that being said, theres 5 modes to choose from, 3 is available on your first play-through, the other 2 are unlocked after. It's a platformer also. You control 2 people, a Bunny and a Fairy. With those two you work together to defeat enemies who are in your way. Along the way you can collect power-ups that are hidden, or you need a certain skill to get to it. Theres also hidden areas so you can explore as much as you want. Meaning, Rabi-Ribi is pretty much unlinear.\n\nThe Music\nI felt as if this deserved its own little review because well, it's freaking amazing. Pretty much every Soundtrack fits it's atmosphere well. The developers nailed it big time with this. At first I was gonna just buy the game, which i did, but now I'm going to buy the OST once I get the chance. Trust me, I can tell the amount of effort put into the music and I think It's one of the best yet, especially for a bullet hell.\n\nMore Personal Opinions\nI feel as if Rabi-Ribi the best Bullet Hell I ever played. It has a decent story-line, great graphics for a pixelated game, ( which btw i love) and overall a nice feel to it. Some people see this game and think it's just another Ecchi type game considering the clothing but in all honesty once you play the game and start to get into it, you'll honestly forget about it. Your mind will be on upgrades, exploring, and how to get stronger for bosses.\n\nRating\nI find Rabi-Ribi a marvelous Bullet-Hell that should have more attention to it. I'll tell this to my friends for a fact, this game needs more love. Easily one of the best Bullet-Hells of 2016, if not One of the best in it's genre.  The Pricing is nice for the amount of content and love the developers put in.\n\nMY RATING ON THIS GAME IS A SOLID 10/10. I can not reccommend this game enough to you guys, buy it asap, you WILL love it, thats all i have to say, just please buy it, let it change your life like it did to me and everyone else who loved this game.","May 13","true","31.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If possible I would put neutral.\n\nAnyway, Rabi Ribi has great gameplay and it's a ton of fun.  It handles really smoothly and you really feel like Erina does what you want her to do, which is great.  The characters are all really cute, albeit generic, and some of the interactions can be really fun.  The soundtrack of the game is also really great and is really fitting and sets the mood for each different fight perfectly, although it would be even better if some of the tracks were a little longer.\n\nNow, on to the cons that make my recommendation neutral instead of the amazingly positive it would otherwise be.  It's worth mentioning that the story isn't very creative or engaging, but with this kind of game that isn't a big deal since it's very gameplay based.  In fact the game itself I'm pretty sure acknowledges this at points and makes a joke here and there about it.  Anyway the real problem is that the game can lag like all hell for no real reason.  I'm running it on a computer that can run games like Dark Souls and Fallout no problem, lag free, but this 2D game will often times run obscenely slow.  It isn't constant, it mainly happens for me only on certain bosses, but it makes those bosses completely unfun and frustrating.  Sometimes the lag can help you slide inbetween the bullets more efficiently, but more often it will just kill you by making you jump the wrong height or something.  Even when the lag DOES help you, it ruins the experience and makes victory feel pretty lame.  All this lag happens on both V.Low and Performance settings graphics.\n\nSince the lag only happens for certain bosses generally, the rest are still extremely fun and so it doesn't take away from the experience as much as it could potentially, but it is still very frustrating.\n\nIf your computer is poor, I definitely wouldn't bother with this game though.","May 23","true","110.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GameDevYal/recommended/400910/","GameDevYal","Yal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GameDevYal/","113 products in account","Rabi-Ribi is a pretty underrated game. While at first glance it might appear to be only fanservice or semi-hentai, it's a surprisingly deep metroidvania that is actively updated - since I last played it, it has gotten a new difficulty setting, a boss rush mode, and a huge overhaul to the map system. Rabi-Ribi is very projectile-based, sort of playing like a danmaku platformer, especially during boss battles, and while 50 HP might seem much when most enemies deal damage in the single digits, rest assured that it's not.\n\nThe main draw with RR is how free it is. During the first section of the game, you pass through 6 different areas, and you are more or less free to stray off and explore any of them if you want to - and know HOW to get around - and, most of all, can handle the enemies. The game even has an achievement for beating the game without getting your main weapon in the first area, despite said area appearing impossible to leave without obtaining the hammer.\n\nI've only played the game for 2 hours so far, but it's been 2 very enjoyable hours; the main reason I've not played more is because I realized there were some cool updates coming (in particular the map overhaul; the map was the version I played's biggest flaw by far) and I wanted to get them first. The only remaining flaw now is that there are plenty of human enemies in some areas, and they are hard to distinguish from random bystanders. Then again, you can't hurt friendly NPCs, so there's no harm in shooting them a bit just in case.\nThere are plenty of moves in the game: your normal hammer attacks, carrot bombs, dashing, controlling your fairy sidekick and using her for magic support fire, eating food for emergency recovery... the game is more or less unplayable without a controller due to the sheer number of inputs you need to handle. (FYI, I've played through all of Axiom Verge with a keyboard with no real issues)\n\nIf you like bullet hell games or shooters in general, you'll like Rabi-Ribi. If you like metroidvanias or Super Smash Bros., you'll like it too. In fact, I'm sure this game will make you like both bullet hells and metroidvania games, even if you didn't do it before. If you're into fanservicey anime CGs, you'll have a blast, but even if you despise it, the gameplay will make up for it. Higher difficulties don't just increase the damage you take, they radically change boss attack patterns, and bundled with the free exploration, this makes for stellar replayability.","June 4","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've been wanting to get it for a while and my amazing good friend bought it for me today and I'm very happ!\n\nI 100% reccomend this game, I was hooked from the start and it has an atmosphere that just makes you feel happy. Alot may see the price and think it's a bit too much, but for me, it's really not. If I had the money, I'd still buy this game in a heartbeat!\n\nPersonal rating: 10/10","June 6","true","14.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
