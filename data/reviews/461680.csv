Flight doesn't feel real to me even after messing with weight/expo/drag/blah blah. Using a taranis. I'v been flying fpv for 2 years. Sound is terrible. A few of the maps if you fly fast enough you can fly through objects. I'm sorry but it just doesn't feel right at all to me. I'm going to keep the game though and hope that it is fixed in the future. I bought this for practicing new moves and such.","May 23","false","1.4"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"

Would also like to see some customisation similar to Liftoff.\n-I cannot run the game in fullscreen mode, I can only play windowed mode (I have multiple monitors, I think it's messing with the game a little).\n\nSuggestions:-I would love to see a free flight mode with an optional god mode to muck around in and not worry about crashing and resetting.\n-Player made content would be awesome, especially through steam workshop. Players could submit drone part assets, levels, you name it for anyone to use.\n-A campaign mode, no drone sims as far as I know include a campaign mode. I think the devs could take advantage of this and really set this game apart from the other sims.\n\nI can't review multiplayer aspects yet as I have not tried them, feel free to add me if you want to try some multiplayer in the future and I can revisit this review.\nOverall, it is a great simulator, definitely pick it up and practice with it - it might save you a few real life crashes and save you more than the game cost itself.\nLooking forward to updates from the developers!","April 30","true","1.5"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

I wish they would add an option to make your own map, and also have like free mode where you can fly anywhere and do anything like stunts or maybe have a hoop to go through and do stunts through it and practice for the courses. Would be pretty sick. I also fly drones, (in real life) it is pretty much like flying a drone if you have a controller. I highley reccomend this to anyone that wants to fly drones in the future or to know what its like to have a racing drone.","May 17","true","2.9"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","0"

Really love crash animations like IRL.\n\nSetup can't be easier with Taranis, tuning is limited but don't like to bother on this usually so it's pretty ok for me.\n\nPhysics is convicing but still need to be improved. Throttle isn't powerful enough (likely 3S or less).\nMost of my crashes come from that point.\n\nOne map only, fun to play with but a bit small, you get LOS quite quickly.\n\nRespawn function works great, You restart instantly. No god mode but very friendly at low speed.\n\nWould love for next update :\n- one or two more maps\n- 4S Lipo flystyle\n- Recording function (and share a flight on FB for instance)\n- several frames and spare parts\n\nWell done on this one !\nTime to go back in the game and cut some trees  ;)","April 30","true","1.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

I've never touched a real drone or fpv goggles in my life and I feel much more confident that I at least wouldn't make a fool out of myself if I ever try someone's. And I certainly intend to, because this has really inspired me to give it a shot!\n\nI'll leave others to say how realistic it is, as that is a concern of mine, but I must say that it is very well done and looks gorgeous. The developer(s) watch feedback and implement suggestions within days; hopefully this, along with additional content, can keep this game running and make it as popular as it deserves to be.","May 19","true","17.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Physics are fairly crisp and the courses are challenging. Lacking content, graphical fidelity and UI polish right now but this game will appease many drone enthusiasts.\n\nIt's got a very high skill curve and I found the stock throttle control was fairly difficult on a PS4 DS controller since it lacks the ability to hold the throttle at a specific value unlike a typical tx. (Have yet to try it with my Dx5e since I need a specific cable). I wouldn't recommend this game at all for someone wanting to just use a KB/Mouse.\n\nOverall I think for the $12 price this is a no brainer for anyone looking or interested in trying drone flying without the larger investment or worrying about crashing. Right now content is extremely limited, which does question is longevity, but I think if the devs are consistent with updates this game could be a fantastic sandbox for drone enthusiasts in the future.\n\nThings i'd like to see:\n\nUI improvements; it's blocky and messy in places (yes it's EA, but it needs more consistency)\nDrone customization, props, motors, batteries, flight controllers etc in addition to the weight/power sliders in settings\nLess dependence on 'set' courses/maps and a 'random' or 'seeded' option that mixes up the gate locations each time. All levels quickly become stale after you race them a few times.\nWorkshop integration; drone skins, custom maps/level generator","May 10","true","5.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"
