It is a truly casual game, and even at the end levels it will be easy to “pass” each level; however, to get 3-stars in later levels can be quite a challenge and will require perfect planning and execution in real time.  It is a very basic game, with little depth; but it is a great game for situations where you want to play something that isn’t overly immersive and is easy to put down.\n\nThe idea of the game is to pick up children and drop them off at school.  The mechanics are very simplistic.  The game boils down to logistical puzzles that will require you to figure out the optimum paths to take to earn the most points.  You do this by clicking on icons as they pop up on the screen in real time, while being sure to adhere to auxiliary rules that influence your score.  As the game progresses, different types of rules are added; this makes it increasingly difficult to get a 3-star rating in later levels.  Simply “passing” the levels by reaching the par score remains rather easy.\n\nYou also are racing against the clock as you do all of this, as the children will not wait around indefinitely once their icon pops up on the screen.  You can disable the clock by playing in Relaxed Mode, however that also disables achievements.  This mode would be good for children, but will probably make the game boring for any adult gamer.\n\nThere are also power-ups and vehicle upgrades which can be purchased that will help you earn better scores.  It should be noted, however, that there is only a limited amount of money to be earned in the game; you cannot repeat levels to re-earn money for upgrades.  This is kind of an annoying catch-22 during the late game; as the best upgrades would help 3-star the last levels, but you must 3-star the last levels to afford the best upgrades.\n\nThere isn’t much else to say about School Bus Fun.  It is a fun, little puzzle game that is quite short and simple.  It won’t be the best game you play this year, but it makes for good fun if you like the kind of puzzles it offers.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","August 30, 2015","true","15.8"," 49 of 53 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","49","53","2","0"

Yet somehow it’s still fun to some degree.\n\nLong version:School Bus Fun is a service industry game (the sub-genre started by Diner Dash), where your goal is to use your car to transport an increasing number of children to their local school. With this theme and graphics, one would assume this game is made for children to train their memory and help with their hand-eye coordination. While School Bus Fun indeed does all those things, maybe it also overdid it a notch.\n\nAs usual in these games, there are over a dozen “customer” types with their increasingly complicated needs. As the game progresses, it gets a lot more difficult meeting these demands in time, especially when there are two cars to control simultaneously. It can get so hectic that even an adult could feel overwhelmed.\nAlso, unlike most service industry games, the children appear randomly on each attempt. Beyond adding an unneeded level of difficulty, this can result in stages where it is impossible to get the top score without a few resets.\n\nI know it seems I’m only complaining, but the game really is more difficult than it looks. Still, it can be fun, when not frustrating, and may keep you around long enough to reach the seemingly ridiculous 10 and 15-hour achievements.","December 21, 2015","true","18.8"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","13","14","0","3"

You are tasked with picking up kids in the right order to make combos, all the while keeping track of incompatible kids and your car's fuel usage.\nEach level becomes more difficult as more and more kids are added, and they all have their quirks. Girls want to ride with other girls; Loners want to be the only one on the bus; Kids won't get on a bus that already has a bully on it (but bullies will come on buses with others kids), etc.\n\nBy the time you reach the second set of levels you really have a hard challenge to get the 3 star rating every time.\n\nRecommended for anyone that likes logic puzzles.","September 10, 2014","true","7.8"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","1"

Maybe that sounds bad.. but it isn't really.\n\nHow long did it take me to play all levels:\nI played it out in about 3 hours in one day, just to test it out.. but I couldn´t stop playing and now I´m almost finished. Still have to get 3 stars for every level.\n\nThe aim of the game:\nYou get to pick up different kids and some kids travel alone, some don´t, all kids do not want to travel with bully´s. You really got to think which kid goes with which.. even for the sake of various bonuses. You got to upgrade your ¨bus¨ when you can, it´s fun since you will really notice each upgrade will do it´s described job. Your ¨bus¨ also needs repairs/fuel which makes it more realistic.\n\nBugs?\nNot that I know of.\n\nTo recommend?\nI´ll recommend this game anytime.","July 26, 2014","true","4.7"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

This game reminds me of an old flash game about gas pumps and filling up cars, I can't remember the name. Basically, you pick up a kid then click on the school that matches the shield above their heads. Be careful though, some kids like to be driven to school alone, some with their girl pack and some are preppy snobs. Make sure to keep this in mind when it tells you that there is a new kid added to the list. The game can get very challenging and I swear the shield colors on the school are changing on me.","December 19, 2014","true","5.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","1"

For this, I give it a small thumbs up.\n\n+ It's a solid timewaster-type puzzle game.\n+ Entertaining and requiring mild thought.\n- I think the devs could have added a bit more variety in vehicle upgrades.\n- Shortcut keys would have helped some situations. In particular, there should have been a key to cancel the trip queue. There's a button to do this, but the fraction of a second required to mouseover and click the button sometimes makes a real difference.\n- Some achievements don't seem to work right.\n-- The theme could (and should) have been a bit edgier. The graphics and sounds are so stereotypically childish that it takes away some of the fun.","January 3, 2015","true","4.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"
