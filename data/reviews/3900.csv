I've been unable to send reinforcements because Caeser is moving his troops around my territory, destroying farms, mines and villages. I can't spread too thin in fear of my other cities being attacked.\nSo 5 handfuls of Heavy machine Gunners have been defending the city from catapult bombardments and grenadier attacks.\nAnd now, he seems to have set his sights upon the neighbouring city of Memphis.\n\nDiary Entry 2 - I've reached out to the Malinese and Isabella of Spain, and both have declared war on Ceaser. They are on the opposite side of him to me. So while they cannot directly help my cities, they will put pressure on the Western side. So hopefully I can repel the siege and push to his cities. I have a troop of tanks coming in from the Northeast, and a regiment of Marines coming in from the southeast.\n\nDiary Entry 3 - The marine regiment was ambushed on both sides upon coming around a mountain. Despite the enemy taking heavy losses, we lost the regiment.\nLuckily a reinforcement squad was detailed to memphis, so now it's a case of bunkering down for the incoming attack, and planning the counter offensive.\nThe tanks have made significant progress, taking the city of Ardea from the grasp of the Romans. They will continue their progress north, towards Rome itself.\n\nDiary Entry 4 - A reserve regiment of Marines have rendezvoused with the tanks. The dispatch will push on to Rome, flanking from the south, whilst Memphis defends and draws the brunt of the Roman Empire.\n\nDiary Entry 5 - We took two cities to the south. And i decided it was now the time to counter attack. Making losses along the way, we broke through the memphis siege, and took the city of Ostia. It was short lived however, as the enemy retaliated while we were at our weakest and reclaimed the city. Luckily, the reserve squad was just 1 click behind, so now we can retake the city again, and await reinforcements.\nI see very little action on the Western side, I am beginning to believe my allies have hidden motives. Their troops linger on the enemies borders. Perhaps waiting until I am weak enough that they may strike both me and Julius Ceaser. I must prepare for this eventuality.\n\nDiary Entry 6 - I was wrong to doubt Isabella. How could I let the seeds of battle cloud my mind. She commenced her march across the border today, and in one fell swoop, she liberated a city from the enemy. Her troops have now joined mine, and we march together to the heartland of Mother Rome-ia\n\nDiary Entry 7 -  Isabella and I, sat down today and signed the Pernament Alliance of our two peoples. We will forever be comrades in arms, and for this, I graciously gave her 3 cities as gifts. Not without proper thought mind you. They are in 3 strategic places to mine enemy and mine future enemies. This will allow us to adaquately aid each other in times of war, and even further each others growth.\nTo our future! -clinks glass-\n\nDiary Entry 8 - Rome has fallen to Spain! I made a good choice in allies, Isabella is ruthless, a worthy opponent to any who may cross her.\nThe Chinese also declared war on Germany, Frederick reached to me.. unfortunately, as well as the war on the Romans is going, I cannot extend myself at this time. He seemed disappointed.\n\nDiary Entry 9 - An achievement I am unsure of. We have created...The Atom Bomb. I don't know what to think about this. A weapon with destruction beyond any imagination. One that would win countless wars, but with such heavy costs. I must make sure this never falls into the hands of our enemies..\n\nDiary Entry 10 - We were pushing the city of Cumae today, they had heavily fortified the city, and it seemed an arduous task. The combined might of myself and Spain, and yet we struggled.. A shadow appeared on the horizon. They came bearing the flag of Rome, and begun a charge on our flank. We were outnumbered, the rest of our forces had lagged behind to clear up the enemy remnants. We hastily mustered a defence as best we could. The doors to Cumae opened, the cities huge force came out to greet us. We were preparing for defeat..\nBut then there they came. The Malinese army! They routed the enemy on our flank. Taking advantage of this turn of tide, we charged the enemy city, gates wide open and with morale turned, we claimed it for our own.\n\nDiary Entry 11 - It's been a long war, spanning many years. Due to the efforts of our 3 way alliance, we have chipped the Romans down to a fraction of the strength they once possesed. Brundisium is their final city, their last stain on a world so tainted by greed. I have the honour of being the one to remove that stain. I now make my march, our footsteps of doom bellowing down upon the city walls. We are coming..\n\nDiary Entry 12 - As we approached the gates of the Palace, Ceaser panicked. He offered a Peace Treaty, along with all his coffers. "Why barter for what I can simply take?" I said, leaving a lifeless corpse on the floor. My troops rejoiced, sharing drinks with the Spanish, and food with the Malinese. What was I doing? I was looking across the border to the North... towards the prosperous Chinese Empire.\n\nTL;DRHonestly, you have to be a fan of these types of 4x games, to enjoy them. A lot of people find them boring because there's a decent amount of waiting around while you wait for buildings to finish, units to be trained, research to be finished etc. Saying that, I find Civ games to be faster paced than games such as Crusader Kings/Europa Unversalis. The learning curves are a lot smaller too!\n\nYou'll never find great graphics in these types of games, but you'll always find amazing gameplay, and that's what matters right? Great gameplay is what keeps you playing, not great graphics.\nI'm not a fan of the newer games, Civilization: Beyond Earth especially. I think they completely ruined that game. However, if you enjoyed the previous games (1, 2, 3) or you want to get into the series without spending a lot of money. I whole heartedly recommend this game.","October 29, 2014","true","575.4"," 425 of 462 people (92%) found this review helpful 163 people found this review funny","92","425","462","163","15"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/penguin1992/recommended/3900/","penguin1992","AirBear1","http://steamcommunity.com/id/penguin1992/","453 products in account","First off, I actually have 75 hours in this game at the time of writing, since you launch Beyond the Sword if you have the DLC. This review will be done through the eyes of a player coming from Civ V and will be a comparison of the two.\n\nTL;DR - I love it. Probably not as good as Civ V, but familiar and different enough that I think it makes an easy buy for any Civ V fan.\n\nPros:\n+ The espionage is much, much more entertaining and active, I love it. The capabilities of a spy include bombing building, poisoning the water supply (food reduction), sabotaging production, stealing technology, influencing religion and civics, and a couple more. You can also alter your production of espionage points to lean towards or away from certain civs (for example you can produce more points towards your biggest rival, and less points from distant civs). It is a great system.\n\n+ Combat is very different, and in my opinion better. Units unique abilities are given more weight; archers and longbowmen can be incredibly powerful on city defense, catapults and trebuchets are almost absolutely necessary for taking a city, etc. There is more incentive to not just build 20 of whatever unit has the most combat strength and charge in. Combat gets a little smarter.\n\n+ Given the 5 year gap between IV and V, you'd think that Civ IV would look much poorer...and you would kinda be right. Things don't look as great, a couple of the leaders are ugly as sin, but it more than makes up for this in building a stronger atmosphere. It does this by actually having a few different models for units, and I don't mean unique units for civs. It things like this; everyone can build a swordsman, and they will have have the same stats, but if you play as Arabia, they will have scimitars, if you play and England, they will have broadswords, workers will look different, etc. It is a great touch. There is also unique music for each time period, like when you first start a game it will play tribal music. If you are playing as Spain and click a unit, they will speak in Spanish. These kinds of things make up for the 5 year gap in graphical capabilities.\n\n+ Random events. Now I know this might sound bad, but they are reasonable and I think spice things up quite well. They are not completely random and tied various things like the time period. Examples would be a nearby mountain being an erupting volcano and destroying nearby improvements, if you have the slavery civic you might have a slave revolt and lose production for awhile. You'll also get choices most the the time. Like a Russian government official wants to defect to your country, do you accept him and gain espionage points against Russia? Or arrest him and hand him back over, gaining a relationship boost for Russia? It's fun.\n\nCons:\n- What I feel is the biggest con: there is a loss of uniqueness for civs. There are no civ perks like they're were in Civ V (Venice can only build one city, Rome gets +25% for each building already in the capital, etc). These perks were one of my favorite things in V and I miss them. Each civ still gets a unique building and unit, but these often are (mechanically) much more boring than they were in Civ V. Nothing like the Zulu unit who has a first strike, or Portugal's ship that can also do a trade mission. Often in Civ IV, the unique units just start with a particular free promotion, that any other unit could get if it gets enough experience. These changes allow for more freedom but also take away some of the reason you pick a particular civilization: to play a particular playstyle. I pick India because I want to play small but powerful, Rome because I want to spread my empire far and wide, Germany because I want to have large standing armies, etc. Instead most civs have multiple leaders to choose from. While this is cool to see different faces, all the leaders have two traits that many other civs also have. Yeah Genghis Khan has the aggressive trait (certain unit types get free promotion and double production speed of barracks) but so does Stalin, and probably 5 or 6 other leaders.\n\n- Half of the victory conditions have issues. Science and score are fine. Culture victory is boring as hell. It involves nothing more than accumulating culture points from building and wonders and once 3 cities reach 50,000 bam, you win. Even pre-dlc Civ V cultural victory had you build the Utopian Project. Diplomatic victory is nigh impossible. There are no city states in Civ IV, so you are force to kiss everyone's ♥♥♥ and bend to their wills if you want that victory. Even then if you have different religions they will basically never vote for you. Conquest Involves you taking ALL other cities. Yes even that one out in that distant snow-covered island that has a population of 2. This is kinda-sorta "fixed" by the Domination victory type, which involves getting x% of the total land and y% of the total population in the world. Except the numbers are so high that you basically only get it when you could have easily won through science/military/score.\n\nMinor stuff:\n- Unit can stack on one tile. Except the markers for how many units are there max out at 8. So I can't tell if a nearby city has 8 units (hey this is a border city and I am just defending it) or 24 units (hey I am about to ♥♥♥♥ing wreck you in two turns).\n+ You can see numeric breakdown of relationships for other civs. -4 for different religion, +2 for fair trades, -9 for huge recent war. Quickly brings you up to speed on how heavy certain actions are.\n+ You can trade technologies!\n+ A couple more interesting technologies.\n- The religion system has no perks to choose from like in Civ V.\n+ In the very beginning of the game you have to watch out for wild animals like bears and wolfs.\n\n\n\n\n\n","July 27, 2015","true","0.6"," 157 of 167 people (94%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","94","157","167","9","6"

Before me stood a tribe of people who called themselves 'Romans'. They have decided to finally settle down after many ages of nomadic life, they look to me to guide them in these uncertain times. Who would have known, that this small settlement would be the beating heart of what would be perhaps the grandest Civilization that has ever come to pass. They all looked to me to guide them on this journey, it was up to me to guide these people to their glory, perhaps even...their destiny.\n\n3000BC. It was not long after when i came across other groups of people, each with their own cultures, one particular group i met claimed to call themselves 'Germans'. We greeted eachother with a sense of suspicion of our two peoples. Beforehand we knew nothing of the world but our own kind, i could tell by the look by his facial expression that it would be a while before we could trust eachother. As it would turn out, his suspicions later on would be well founded.\n\n2000BC. Surveying the known world before me, i immediately saw a potential problem. The geographical location of the Germans mean't that i would be able to keep them penned in, in order for my own people to claim the surrounding lands as their own and settle down in the areas of question, but i soon realised on the possibility that i may need to subjugate them by military force before this potential nuissance to my South East grows to become an ever annoying thorn in my side. I made my choice, in order to make sure my people would prosper largely undisturbed, the German people must become part of the Roman Empire for the sake of longer term peace between our two peoples.\n\n1500BC. After building some legions of Archers and Praetorians, i watched the borderlands closely, they had already expanded to make a settlement just east of my own. But that was not the main concern, as i discovered i still had an open borders agreement with the Germans, as they managed to settle to the North of my growing empire also. I immediately cancelled the agreement in attempt to contain him and prevent such a move again, but the fact they had settled to the North, where a vast continent was waiting for their potential to sieze mean't i could delay no longer with my plans for subjugation.\n\nIt was time to sound the horns and bang the drums, to war.\n\n1400-700BC. To be honest, i was a little uncertain what the outcome may be. The Germans had concentrated their troops in the cities, while i was spread thin on the offensive and in some ways, fighting a war on two fronts, since i wanted to take the German city of Munich in the North as soon as possible to minimise any chances of them to expand further into the world that would lay before them, while at the same time besieging the settlement to the East so they cannot so easily rally their troops and use the settlement as a springboard to invade my territories.\n\nBut this was Rome, they possessed some of the finest warriors of their time, the Praetorians. They made devastating work of the German troops which were quite numerous and perhaps to most lesser quality troops, too strong. However, fighting a war on two fronts still takes its toll. As i concentrated my forces to the East to take the settlement in order to march on their capital, Berlin, while harassing the Northern settlement to make sure they could not grow so easily.\n\n600BC. Berlin has fallen, and with it, the heirachy and leader of the German people, I also gained new knowledge of a settlement to the North East of Rome itself. I had been aware of this Civilization, but not in finer detail. Upon looking at our geographical locations i thought to myself, "It may be possible i have to subjugate this Civilization too, some of their settlements are already not too far from my own, then again, the Egyptians could perhaps keep them occupied in terms of landgrabs alone for me to turn my attention elsewhere.\n\n500BC-1200AD. The Greeks to the west have had me concerned. I know little to nothing of their military strength, i would be investing more troops to the area, if not for the accursed barbarians who seem too keen on stealing some of Rome's riches by pilliaging the lands. I also decided in the end, due to the present situation, it was not worth going after the Milanese to the North East.\n\nThe French and Spanish seem to have been driven to the point of War. Isabella urged me to join the conflict againt the French. I declined, since to fight a war quite far away and at a time when i was occupied with growth would put quite a strain on my Empire's production and economy.\n\n1300-1600AD. The 'Franco-Spanish' war has come to an end it seems. No clear victor as i can make out of it. I'm glad that the balance of power has been indecisive as this means i am pretty much the more dominant power of the world. Plus when i have borders of 4 nations to watch over, my power is best kept conserved on the homefront. Meanwhile, i had aquired a technology in order to break free from being only able to traverse shallow waters. Now able to traverse deeper bodies of water, i can begin exploring more of the world. I soon found a new Continent, and more Civilizations with it. But there was no room for expansion, as evident as not too soon the Persian and Mongolian Empires would duke it out.\n\n1700-1800AD. It seems the Japanese are having a go this time against the Spanish. This time though, upon Spain's request to assist her against the agressors, i answered the call, something which would save her for the time being.\n\nJapans armies were something of the last era, and stood little to no hope against my Grenadiers and Musketmen. I razed one of the Japanese occupied cities they had cultural claim over and captured, so they would not have such claims over the surrounding lands again any time soon, while the other city they occupied, i liberated and handed over authority to its original rulers the Spanish. The Japanese, shattered by their losses made peace with Spain and given my job was complete, i followed thereafter. Victory was shortlived however, as Napoleon of France was now beginning his march into Spanish territory, thus begun the 'Second Franco-Spanish' war.\n\n1800-1830. The war was going horribly for Spain, the capital Madrid had fallen, and upon getting dragged in found out that France was on par with technology as i was. My expidition force had no heavy guns of the like, and in so much as step a single foot on French soil, my expidition force was mostly anniahlated. Only a company of Grenadiers fortified at the Spanish city i recaptured was all that remained. As i counted my dead and came to terms with what had happened. I recieved news from the Milanese Embassy...\n\n...A state of war was declared between us.\n\n1830-1930. The 100 year struggle to quell the Milanese was a bloody one. I learned the hard way the usage of artillery on cities, and after taking a 3rd city from them, figured they had been taught a lesson and put in their place. So i signed a peace treaty with them to which i can imagine we were both relieved from. The war had taken a toll on my power status as i now didn't have the lead i had before this bitter war. I also considered razing the city of Gao to prevent Egyptian influence threatening my borders. But in the end i spared it and decided to give it to the Egyptians as a gift.\n\n1950.\nFrom here i leave to you to decide what the fate of the Roman people shall be in the next 100 years. As it stands, i am in a sort of Cold-War esque stand off with the Egyptians, while the Indians on the other Continent are really making things concerning on the score and i cannot afford another war, things are getting tight indeed.\n\nMay not be as graphically good looking as Civ V, but i don't mind that small little detail. From what i hear Civ IV is more complex so may feel more rewarding as a result. I may have only *36 hours gameplay, but damn am i enjoying this game.\n\n8/10\n\n*At the time of review.","September 7, 2015","true","102.0"," 151 of 168 people (90%) found this review helpful 58 people found this review funny","90","151","168","58","8"

I discovered it was buggy. What I did play was really fun though. So my in-laws bought me Civilization III, which was really fun. I then saw that Civilization IV was on sale, along with the expansions, so I bought the main game and a couple of the expansions. I am currently enjoying the happily ever after.\nThis is one of the most addictive games I have ever played. My husband and I are enjoying a hotseat match in which I am sure will end in a bloodbath. In Civilization IV: Beyond the Sword I am preparing to conquer the world with my mighty Celtic army. Civilization IV is an awesome strategy game in which almost anything is possible. There are so many different leaders to choose, and many different ways to beat the game. Sure, you could do a military victory, but you can also win diplomatically, artistically, and financially. There is also the Space Race...\nFor those of you kind of wary of strategy titles, let me assure you this is a very newbie friendly game. There are a variety of difficulties, and very detailed tutorials to help out. Also, being turn based has a huge advantage in being able to think out what you want to do. Having played Paradox Interactive titles like Victoria II, this is a far cry from the level of complexity found in those games. Nor is it very concerned with historical authenticity. When I first played as Boudicca, a warrior queen of the Celts, I expected to run into one of the Caesars, but instead I ran into General Bismark! My husband demonstrated some interesting divergents from history by having his Germans found Judaism 8), Christianity, and Islam. By what should have been mid-early Dark Ages, his musketmen were busy conquering the Russian Civilization. By the Industrial Revolution, his assorted tanks were conquering the world. He then won peacefully by using the UN to vote himself as the ruler of the world. Yeah...you definitely couldn't do that in a Paradox Interactive title.\nI know I have many many more hours of enjoyment awaiting me in Civilization IV. This is a great game to play solo or with others. I can't wait to explore all the possibilities.","March 9, 2015","true","86.6"," 98 of 105 people (93%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","93","98","105","14","13"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/3900/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Civ IV makes plenty of great changes and additions to just about every aspect of the hazardously habit-forming strategy blueprint that famed designer Sid Meier and his talented team have made famous the world over, from combat to diplomacy to research to production to winning the space race. undamentally, this is a much-improved version of the same Civ games we've all been playing and desperately trying to put down for years. And that's far from a bad thing. In fact, it's an awesome thing.If you're familiar with the Civilization series, then you're already well aware that they've traditionally been turn-based strategy games that let you play as the political leader of one of the world's nations in a fictitious bid to take over the globe.The series gives you plenty of ways to do this, such as conquering your neighbors, researching advanced technology, or, in Civilization III (and IV), creating the most cultured society on the planet. It's this great variety that helps give Civ IV the same alarmingly addictive quality its predecessors carried. Like in previous games, your political leader has two special traits that will influence his or her reign, though all the game's traits are new.The Civ series' gameplay has several components, and almost every single one of them is improved in Civ IV. For instance, the series' combat system, which pits different military units against one another based on relative unit strength and technology, has been changed to a "strength" system that seems more intuitive.Civ IV has also improved on the way diplomacy works. While you can still make nice with your neighbors, you have more options than just trading goods, cities, technologies, and/or relations. You can attempt to influence your neighbors to make war or peace with other neighbors, and you can even fence everyone out of your backyard using the game's new "open borders" system.The new great people system is an interesting and useful addition that will probably be especially appreciated by experts. Great people can be expended in exchange for a number of powerful abilities. Civ IV makes a turn for the better by emphasizing strategic planning in general, which ultimately makes the game more balanced. In response to fan requests to adjust the pace of the game, developer Firaxis has added three speeds: the surprisingly fast normal speed, the even-faster quick speed, and the slower-paced epic speed. Even single-player and multiplayer options have been improved in Civ IV. The single-player game offers much-improved artificial intelligence that seems to cheat much less than in previous games, or not at all.Multiplayer also seems to work quite well, and thanks to the game's faster pace, it seems much, much more realistic to actually finish multiplayer games, especially on the "quick" speed setting.The actual game itself looks considerably better, even though the interface can seem a bit rough at times.An incredibly addicting, engrossing, and incredibly well-designed inclusion. No stone was left unturned as the developers crafted this masterpiece and if you’re a fan of the previous installments of this game, you’re definitely going to enjoy this one.","September 29, 2014","true","22.1"," 52 of 61 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","52","61","2","0"

With little to no army but an expansive amount of fields and pastures. But soon enough we were running out of space. We decided to found 3 more cities all in the continet we resided in. After exploring the continent the Russians met two other Empire who lived nearby first was Asoka of India, and secondly was Saladin of Arabia. Asoka and Flazam became good allies, Russia would send some of are livestock from are farms and in return he would give us money.  For 1000 years we remained a humble farming civilization. That was until the scholars in Moscow came to there great leader Flazam II with some reseach. Gun Powder, this new discovery allowed are civilization great new oppitunties, and so in 1245 AD Russias militisation began. Are Armies grew with the most advanced soilders in the planet. Grenidiers, Riflemen galore. We gained a reputation so great two nearby Arabian cities revolted to join are Empire. Quickly Russia became the greatest military might, but still we remained close Allies with are neibhour Asoka, a relationship that had stood the test of time. Saladin however attempt to convert my people to Taoism and was spreading vile rumours about are wise ally Asoka. After hearing this news Flazam II got his noble stead and rode to Mumbai to discuss the pesky Saladin. it seemed India too resented him, therefore Flazam II gave are knowledge of gun powder to Asoka, with this gift Flazam II made a proposition. The Russia-Indian alliance should combine on a common enemy of Saladin and to unify the continet  under are great alliance. Therefore in 1348 war on Saladin was declared by both are nations. We quickly mobilised are troops on the eastern front storm 3 of Saladins cities adding them to are now vast empire. The war on the west was more vicious India was suffering some large casulties, therefore Flazam II sent some of the best fighters in are Empire from St Petersburg to aid in that front. With the help we pushed both fronts right back to the circumference of Saladins capital. In only 25 years Saladin was on his knees. India accept a treaty with Saladin. Flazam II was furious. India had left when we were so close. However Flazam II peristed the battle around Saladins capital was a bloody one. Lasting 40 years and draining the great Russian empire, slaves in St Petersburg were on strike and the War was begining to drag on. Therefore Flazam persuaded India to join the war once more in a final battle on the capital, and the famous Battle of 1 Turn occured. Saladin was destroyed and The Russia-India Alliance were victorious, but Flazam II still rembered how Asoka has betrayed him and the Alliance was on thin ice, Flazam II spent the next 300 years picking up the pieces of his problems in the Russian cities. The people demanded democracy and in the summer of 1789 Flazam II abdicated and was replaced by the New Russian president. Moscow was well known for its scientfic discoveries, and in 1867 we discovered Urianium and began the Manhattan project. Meanwhile over the past 200 years Asoka had entered a golden age with an empire far superior to ares. This competion began a Cold War with Russia the alliance broke down and times were tough. By the dawn of 20th centuary we had completed the Manhattan project and in 1920's the Cold War became increasingly serious. India mobilised troops round are borders and began sending spies. After India blockaded are Urianium farms the Cold War esclated and in 1935 the Russian president declared War on India, the next year we launched 3 nucleur bombs on Indias cities. India suffered but however they invaded are Urianium fields and launched a vicious offense. Russia was overwhelmed with a war on 5 fronts. And in 1977 we were on are knees all are cities were on the brink of revolution and Asoka had captured 1 of are cities. Russia pleaded with India and India agreed and the war ended albeit with a harsh treaty. India empire flourished as we attempt to pick up ares. In 2014 the Greek Empire was getting worryingly large. It was on a separate continet sharing there land with Mao Zedong. I negotiate with Mao. I asked him to declare war on the Greeks. I pretended to ally with Mao but really I only wanted Mao to invade Greece because I knew the Greeks growth would slow, I secretly however knew Mao would lose albeit it would take at least a hundred years. In 2050 the game ended with India its victors\n\n\n10/10 would spend 30mins making review again","February 19","true","15.8"," 51 of 63 people (81%) found this review helpful 42 people found this review funny","81","51","63","42","6"

However, it does have some flaws.\n\nGraphics- The Graphics on this game are, by all standards, nothing special, but a vast improvement over previous Civ titles. Besides, graphics in a strategy game aren't really the main focus.\n\nSound- The game has some great music tracks, which are era specific and usually appropriate. While the music does get a bit repetitive, I still haven't gotten tired of the opening title. The sound effects are pretty funny, which help contribute to the feeling that Civ4 is "just a game". A good thing, in my opinion. Also, Leonard Nimoy speaks to you every time you research a technology.\n\nGameplay- This is where Civ4 really shines. The game is really infinitely replayable, with infinite possibilities and completely ludicrous historical combinations to try! The city building and expanding mechanic is very solid, however combat needs A LOT of work. Battles are simplistic and very unbalanced at best, relying almost completely on numbers and tech level rather than strategy or practicality. I for one, feel that stone age spearmen should never be able to defeat attack helicopters. In addition to this, some of the civics and the entire religion mechanic are completely pointless, which is a shame, considering they could have been put to very good use. Ultimately though, the game is still very good, and very addictive.

And I still play Civ IV BTS. BTS is $10, but Civ 4 Complete is $30, so I reccemond the complete edition.\n\nAlso, Baba Yetu is one of the best songs in gaming EVER. Baba Yetu has won a Grammy Award. The first, for a piece of music for a video game.\n\nA+. SO many pros that each and every con is obliberated. GET THIS. NOW. IF YOU HAVE THE MONEY. IF YOU DON'T, THEN FIND A WAY TO GET $20 or $30, and YOU WILL NOT STOP PLAYING.","November 26, 2013","true","1.4"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","17","22","0","3"

If you have that Excel analysis mind-set this is the game for you. If you don’t then fortunately you can dial the difficulty down and you get a similar experience to the Total War series or other turn based games.\n\nThere are several dozen methods of play –you will have to understand the game mechanics to beat the AI on anything other than easy. Each difficulty setting requires a different method of play, forcing you to learn new tactics.\n\nThe tech specs are such that even quite old machines should be able to run it. It’s starting to age – the overworld map looks clunky, but still has enough charm to pull past that.\n\nThere’s clearly been a lot of work put into smoothing the difficulty curve – there’s plenty of tooltips, tutorials and the like. It says something about the depth of the game that I felt these were nowhere near enough.\n\nI recommend it only if you’ve got lots of time on your hands – you’ll get the most out of this game if you sit down and work to understand it.\n\nI’ve heard Civ 5 streamlines some of the game mechanics, so it might be worth going straight for that. Overall, this is a great, if intimidating game.\n","December 8, 2013","true","5.5"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

IV is my second favorite of them. it has a great 3D world with great detail and design as well; the HUD is very user friendly and nothing is hard to find. One of my favorite parts is when you complete a wonder, It gives you a nice animation showing the blue prints then the wonder being built. The units look great too, more so when battling other units. The camera angles can be a bit off sometimes but its not often; the customization is really good! You can change your nation's name and description; then pick what victories are allowed and which ones are not. I wish there was more options for the map instead of just the size and weather types.

He had no skill, and my Civ was double the size (Like my ♥♥♥♥. Heh...stupid joke). Then the Barbarians came and took my city. Instead of kicking his ♥♥♥ at the end, we joined together and destroyed them. After the glorious battle, we shook hands, but quickly ripped the arms off of each other! I struck first, and he came in like an Elephant (Literally). At the end of the Greatest War I have seen in awhile, he won. He took over my 5 cities (I sold one to him, actually), and became a closer friend. In my opinion. This game, really did make us bond, just a little more than before.

It is also a good game to play if you want to end up ruling the world and are unsure of how to do it - um, did you just read that?\n\nSo anyway, first of all there's a bunch of empires all with their own technologies, pros, cons and so on. And for each empire you get at least one leader. Each empire comes with a unique unit which can alter gameplay, such as the English redcoat, the French musketeer or the German Panzer Tank.\n\nThat brings me to the next great part - the units in the game. You start off with one city, and from there you can choose to make/train anything you have the technologies and resources to make/train. For example, you can train a warrior to fight, a scout to explore the map, a settler to find a new city, and later in the game (literally almost at the end), if you have the right stuff, you can make nukes!\n\nThe real icing on the cake is the fact that it is all so - well, real. You make contact with a new country, you make peace with them, you trade with them, you give them stuff - and then they can turn on you. Honestly Germany, why did you? You beat me, and I had grenadiers, war elephants and artillery; all you had were a few archers and a single catapult!\n\nAnd last but not least, there's the winning. You can win by lots of ways: getting the most points by 2050, getting to Alpha Centauri first (space victory), controlling at least half the world, killing all other civilizations etc. All this great stuff turns the game into a real life simulation that is addictive and super fun. 10/10","June 11, 2014","true","12.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The early stages of this game were boring and repetitive, but as you progress, you can quickly build up armies and destroy other civilizations. This game is not as good as Civ 5, but it is quite fun to play. There are still some bugs left in this game such as the military troops gliding through spots and flying through mountains (not natural movements). The tutorial is really good and Sid Meier tells you everything that you should know about the Civilization games. The expansions are pretty useless, unless you want some variety in leaders to choose from and troops.\nOverall, this game can be improved and is definately not worth $20 (mabye $10).\nScore: 6.5/10 (yeh, im being optimistic)","May 5, 2014","true","6.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

The look and feel of the game is completely different and the controls have also been changed around A LOT. It has some of the same concepts from the last game but you basically have to relearn almost the entire thing. The terrain looks completely different (which is just ok) and the cities are set up in a different grid format that i'm really not a fan of, The city display screen has a better way of controlling what the city focuses on such as production, food, or commerce but the way you control what is being built is terrible compared to the old simple list format. Units are controlled with the right click of the mouse severely limiting your access to the civilipedia on certain objects. Units also don't have an attack and defense rating but just a strength level. Although I like how certain units are useful against other certain types there are way too many types of units. Civilization III was way better in almost every aspect of the game.","June 29, 2015","false","13.1"," 5 of 31 people (16%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","16","5","31","2","0"

The balance of the units is so off that advanced units are capable of being distroyed by lower teir; for instance muskets carrying soldiers can kill your commando squad; there are also times when your units simply stand there as they get hit with bullets, swords or elephants, the speratic dice rolling of the combat gets tiresome; expecalliy when it can take you all game just to get a decent sized army.\n\nThe food and disease levels on here also ruin it for me, no real way to fight the disease and trying to combat the hunger just slows the game down, at the end it can take up to a dozen or more turns just to research a new technology but at that point the computer is already 5 or six levels ahead of you, I played Rise of Nations and thought it would be something very similar but this is a very slow punch to the face, I really wouldnt recommend it to anyone unless you like taking all night just to build a couple towns and research some technology, the rts part of this game only makes up a certain 8-10%.","June 12, 2014","false","23.3"," 3 of 58 people (5%) found this review helpful","5","3","58","0","0"

You can also focus on expansion, setting up as many cities as possible to own as much landmass and resources. You can be a nation of great military prowess, devoting production and research to improving your armies, which you can then use to defend your cities or dominate your enemies. You can decide to care about diplomacy, forging friends with the AI, and eventually, winning the diplomatic victory at the U.N.\n\nWorld wonders are a fun feature. I always build the Stonehenge, and from then on build as many as possible. The culture and great person points they give are powerful. The game is also fairly educational on wonders of the world that actually exist or existed.\n\n10/10 would recommend.\n\n","August 13, 2014","true","31.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Within each Civilization you choose a leader and start the game.  You start the game off with a settler to build a town and one warrior.  From there you claim rescources and build a civilization.  You can build farms for food, Cottages for money, mines for material production ect.  You also have to research technologies, these technologies allow you to build more structures within your cities which help them grow faster and build other units.  You also have to take in account other civilizations which you can befriend or turn into an enemy.  I could touch on more but steam Caps the amount of Characters that I can use.

You can costumize the planet by changing the temperature , changing sea water level and many more.\nAfter you are done with the costumization you can get right into the gameplay , firstly you will spawn with 2 Roles ,  a caveman/scout and a Settler. You will have to move the Settler to a place where you would like to build your first city. You can then upgrade the city and expand your country by placing\nmore towns.\nNow this is where it gets spicy.\nYou start to find diffrent countries , you can either choose to be friends or you can choose to be at war with that country. You can also trade items with the other countries and you can plan attacks on other countries and team up at war.\nNow , if you lose the war. Its game over\nyou will have to start again or just go back to an old save...\nOh I forgot to mention , there are also expansions ( which are great) that allow you to have diffrent scenarios . For example , you can choose to be in the 1940's in the WW2 and try to take over diffrent countries. Or ( my favorite) you can choose to find religions and use God's power agains other countries e.g hurricanes , earth quakes e.t.c\nAnyways , feel free to share your opinions in the comments.","June 12, 2014","true","11.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","5"

You can also focus on expansion, setting up as many cities as possible to own as much landmass and resources. You can be a nation of great military prowess, devoting production and research to improving your armies, which you can then use to defend your cities or dominate your enemies. You can decide to care about diplomacy, forging friends with the AI, and eventually, winning the diplomatic victory at the U.N.\n\nWorld wonders are a fun feature. I always build the Stonehenge, and from then on build as many as possible. The culture and great person points they give are powerful. The game is also fairly educational on wonders of the world that actually exist or existed.\n\n10/10 would recommend.\n\n","August 13, 2014","true","31.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Each new version is an improvement on an already good original, adding new refinements and fresh idea's to enhance the game play.  The diplomatic options have come on in leaps and bounds, eliminating one of the few flaws in the first version.  The variety of ways the game can be won, and the option to have a new map every time, ensures each game is different to the last.  The number of Nations that can be played is excellent, and each Nation and it's leaders bring their own skills to the table.  As a result, you can persue a victory based on your Nation's strengths if you wish, or just unleash your Army regardless and go for the hard kill.  A number of difficulty levels change the challenge to match your experience, and the huge customization available gives you the chance to make things as you wish for a specific play.  As an example, if you want a huge Navy select a world type based on islands with a world surface heavy on the water, select a Nation with a nautical skill or Special Unit and get it on.\n\nI played the original back in the 90's, and loved it.  The modern version, with all the extra wonder's and so on, blows it's socks off and steals it's dinner money.  For those seeking a stratergy game, you just found a hard game to beat.","April 27, 2014","true","175.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So, the main differences from Civ 3 I can see are these: it's got a lot more different types of resources; the tech tree has been tweaked and had a few more items added in; there are more Wonders and types of Wonder; there's the whole new "religions" stream of progress options (very Pokemon, in a way - collect them all!);  there's better animation of your units (and you can see your unit as a group, rather than a single individual); civic rules are a lot more customisable across a variety of dimensions (political, economic, social, religious); and you've lost the ability to tweak your palace or view your city close-up.  Oh, and the game can be customised to a much greater degree than before.\n\nIt still has a lot of the same basic assumptions (and thus a lot of the same basic pitfalls) as the earlier games in the series.  A victory via conquest or other aggressive means is always going to out-score a victory by cultural hegemony or other such peaceful means.  The view of "progress" is still very linear, and there's very much a perspective of "the only way is up" (now, admittedly, I haven't really got to the modern era all that often, so I don't know whether there's still the pollution and global warming hazards to be aware of - I really should read the manual to be sure).  The world leaders you're playing are very much biased toward European and Western cultures (there's China, Japan and India representing Asia; Mali and Egypt representing Africa; and the Incas representing South America; meanwhile there's the USA, England, Spain, France, Germany, Russia, Greece, Rome and Persia representing Europe and the global West), so the whole issue of over-emphasis on technologies found useful in the global "West" is a thing.  However, as I said, these are standard problems (of the "this thing I like is somewhat problematic" variety) with the entire series - it's very much a case of either they're deal-breakers for you  as a player, or you accept the game for what it is, and make a mental note of the problematic bits to think about later.\n\nGameplay-wise, it's much the same as all the other iterations of the series: you move any pieces you have available to move, and press enter to signal the end of your turn.  If you don't have any pieces to move, the game will sit there prompting you to press "enter" until the skies fall (my biggest gameplay annoyance, quite honestly), but then, this is a turn-based game, and that's what you're in for as a result of playing it.  (Oh, and if you didn't already have every single turn-based game known to humanity sitting in your Steam preview queue before you started playing, you will shortly afterwards... or maybe that's just me).\n\nI can't comment on the multi-player aspect of the game, because I don't play multi-player (I play games to relax, not to stress myself out by getting pounded into the dirt).  The music is very pleasant (and very repetitive) and you're able to turn it down or off as this suits you.\n\nGiven I play this game to relax, and I'm not really into high scores or anything like that, I'm probably not the best person to review it.  But overall, I'm finding Civ 4 to be an interesting upgrade from Civ 3, and I'm really liking finding out how to handle all the new bits and pieces in the game.","January 28","true","70.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also, ignore my playtime; I put 100s of hours into Civ IV BTS off a disk.   I got the Steam version for convenience sake.)\n\nThis is arguably the best 4x game ever made; I don't think I am alone in this opinion.   What make it so is a combination of things, not just individual features.   The variety of strategies, the diplomacy, the range of units possible, the difference in the character of the Civs, I don't know I could go on and on and I think there are people who can say it better.\n\nThere are two points I do want to make in passing, however.   First, Civ IV was an evolution of Civ 1, 2, and 3.   Some people criticize it because it is an evolution, not a revolutionary new take on 4x.    Personally, I think taking all the good stuff and making it better and adding little stuff that made the whole pie a beautiful thing to experience is a very, very good thing.    Second, Civ IV Vanilla was a very good game, but not a world beater.   The addition of Warlords and especially Beyond the Sword is what made it great.    Of course there are a  lot of mods out there if you want, but the fact is that the only mod I think you might want to get a great gaming experience is the Bug Mod, which doesn't change the game play at all but adds a lot of helpful tools.\n\n10/10  Best Ever.\n","June 11, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is a superb entry into the genre for inexperienced people due to it's fairly simple playstyle, if you were looking for something a little more complex then you can go for that here too. For those who just want to build and play the long game for wars then this game is easy enough to keep on friendly terms with AI empires and easy enough to just click on what you want to build next in your cities. For those looking for a more complex game you can keep an eye on all aspects of your city, from what it is lacking to where your citizens are automating their production. Now, for those who haven't played this game but have played a Civ game I am just going to assume that it was Civ 5 you've played. Compared to 5 this game is a little more complicated but at the same time feels a little more basic compared to the newer installments. It's a refreshing play and feels much more rewarding for that win at the end. For those tiny few that have played 1-3 and expansions but have yet to touch on this then you should seek help for somehow missing this fantastic gem of a game that will leave you saying 'One more turn' like every other Sid Meier's game.\n\nIgnore the small amount of hours at the time of this posting but I've played a lot of hours prior to the purchase through steam. (Civ IV, the game so nice, I bought it twice.)","September 12, 2015","true","8.5"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

Also, ignore my playtime; I put 100s of hours into Civ IV BTS off a disk.   I got the Steam version for convenience sake.)\n\nThis is arguably the best 4x game ever made; I don't think I am alone in this opinion.   What make it so is a combination of things, not just individual features.   The variety of strategies, the diplomacy, the range of units possible, the difference in the character of the Civs, I don't know I could go on and on and I think there are people who can say it better.\n\nThere are two points I do want to make in passing, however.   First, Civ IV was an evolution of Civ 1, 2, and 3.   Some people criticize it because it is an evolution, not a revolutionary new take on 4x.    Personally, I think taking all the good stuff and making it better and adding little stuff that made the whole pie a beautiful thing to experience is a very, very good thing.    Second, Civ IV Vanilla was a very good game, but not a world beater.   The addition of Warlords and especially Beyond the Sword is what made it great.    Of course there are a  lot of mods out there if you want, but the fact is that the only mod I think you might want to get a great gaming experience is the Bug Mod, which doesn't change the game play at all but adds a lot of helpful tools.\n\n10/10  Best Ever.\n","June 11, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So, the main differences from Civ 3 I can see are these: it's got a lot more different types of resources; the tech tree has been tweaked and had a few more items added in; there are more Wonders and types of Wonder; there's the whole new "religions" stream of progress options (very Pokemon, in a way - collect them all!);  there's better animation of your units (and you can see your unit as a group, rather than a single individual); civic rules are a lot more customisable across a variety of dimensions (political, economic, social, religious); and you've lost the ability to tweak your palace or view your city close-up.  Oh, and the game can be customised to a much greater degree than before.\n\nIt still has a lot of the same basic assumptions (and thus a lot of the same basic pitfalls) as the earlier games in the series.  A victory via conquest or other aggressive means is always going to out-score a victory by cultural hegemony or other such peaceful means.  The view of "progress" is still very linear, and there's very much a perspective of "the only way is up" (now, admittedly, I haven't really got to the modern era all that often, so I don't know whether there's still the pollution and global warming hazards to be aware of - I really should read the manual to be sure).  The world leaders you're playing are very much biased toward European and Western cultures (there's China, Japan and India representing Asia; Mali and Egypt representing Africa; and the Incas representing South America; meanwhile there's the USA, England, Spain, France, Germany, Russia, Greece, Rome and Persia representing Europe and the global West), so the whole issue of over-emphasis on technologies found useful in the global "West" is a thing.  However, as I said, these are standard problems (of the "this thing I like is somewhat problematic" variety) with the entire series - it's very much a case of either they're deal-breakers for you  as a player, or you accept the game for what it is, and make a mental note of the problematic bits to think about later.\n\nGameplay-wise, it's much the same as all the other iterations of the series: you move any pieces you have available to move, and press enter to signal the end of your turn.  If you don't have any pieces to move, the game will sit there prompting you to press "enter" until the skies fall (my biggest gameplay annoyance, quite honestly), but then, this is a turn-based game, and that's what you're in for as a result of playing it.  (Oh, and if you didn't already have every single turn-based game known to humanity sitting in your Steam preview queue before you started playing, you will shortly afterwards... or maybe that's just me).\n\nI can't comment on the multi-player aspect of the game, because I don't play multi-player (I play games to relax, not to stress myself out by getting pounded into the dirt).  The music is very pleasant (and very repetitive) and you're able to turn it down or off as this suits you.\n\nGiven I play this game to relax, and I'm not really into high scores or anything like that, I'm probably not the best person to review it.  But overall, I'm finding Civ 4 to be an interesting upgrade from Civ 3, and I'm really liking finding out how to handle all the new bits and pieces in the game.","January 28","true","70.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
