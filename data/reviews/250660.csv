"http://steamcommunity.com/id/haruharuharuka/recommended/250660/","haruharuharuka","Haruka","http://steamcommunity.com/id/haruharuharuka/","3516 products in account","The Year is 1999X. Thermomewclear power: a modern scientific marvel that allows free clean energy for all of bunnykind. This safe and renewable energy was the perfect solution, until the Thermomewclear Power Plant blew up and cursed poor Bunny with a pair cat ears. Still retaining her long lapine ears as well, she is vexed by the fact that no one can tell if she is a rabbit or a cat. She even went as far as to seek the aid of a wise old bunny, but unfortunately he was brutally murdered by a rampaging bull and has left Bunny stranded in the cave of the 7 devils. If you think sounds mightily effed up, you are probably right, but no matter. It is time for Bunny to set forth and kick some devilish ♥♥♥!\n\nBunny Must Die! Chelsea and the 7 Devils is a classic example of the tried and true Metroidvania formula. It was created pretty much singlehandedly by Murasame of Platine Dispositif (aside from voicework), and like his other works the game can be punishingly hard at times. The original release was only in Japan, with 4:3 graphics and a midi-ish soundtrack. However this localization offers many enhancements over the original release, such as new widescreen graphics coded in by Murasame, a wild soundtrack arrangement by Woofle, and a fresh English translation.\n\nWhen starting BMD the first thing you'll notice is the lush hand-drawn anime graphics. The next thing you'll notice is that you can't walk to the right. You must first walk to the left a few steps to collect "The Gears of The Past" to be able to turn around. This quirky bit of humor quite obviously pokes fun at the general mechanics of the Metroidvania genre, and trust me when I say that a whole lot more will be lampooned before you finish the game. The game even pokes fun at you (and then throws a viciously hard boss your way) for sequence breaking. Yes, the large-foreheaded first boss lady will fly off the handle if you skip her.\n\nNow despite the amusing jokes and cliches blown out of proportion, the gameplay in Bunny Must Die is your standard Metroidvania exploration with plenty of Castlevania-style combat. You also gain the ability to bend time to your will, and that opens a whole new dimension in gameplay and puzzle solving. I should note though that no matter how good you are at this sort of game, you WILL die often. Just go into this adventure knowing that fact and you will have a good time. The way we learn is by making mistakes, right? And sometimes being repeatedly run over by a turret-tank while it fires laser beams up your ♥♥♥♥ is a learning experience too.\n\nRockin' Android has definitely gone all-out in the process of making Bunny Must Die a breakout title for the western world. They have go so far as to give the options to use the original graphical mode and soundtrack, despite the overhaul that is provided by default. This speaks volumes of their dedication to customer satisfaction, and to their preservation of the original product's values. Just as with the Gundemonium Collection, Rockin' Android has taken an already awesome property and further polished it to gleam like a diamond and stand out on it's own in the rough sea of indie games.\n\nSo to recap: Bunny Must Die! Chelsea and the 7 Devils offers frenetic platforming, Metroidvania-inspired exploration, kickass brutal bosses, a rocking re-arranged soundtrack, a superbly localized and hilarious story, a cute as heck main character, a super secret hidden character with a second playthrough, and tight controls that ensure that if you screw up, it's your own damn fault. What the heck are you waiting for? Bust out your favorite gamepad, buy the game, and kick some demonic patootie! Bunny's fate depends on YOU!","November 25, 2013","true","5.9"," 52 of 75 people (69%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","69","52","75","5","2"

If you haven't completed all animation sequences down to the pixel, you are NOT allowed to jump or turn.  That means you can't let go of the left button and immediately hold down right and expect to turn.  You won't.  In fact, if you immediately press right after holding left, the game may sometimes glitch and keep making you walk left.\nSame thing with jumping.  If your character is, for any reason, in the middle of standard movement - you will NOT be able to jump.  Yes, that does mean that if you are being pushed forward by an enemy, you CANNOT JUMP.  In certain situations this very much seems to be a bug.  Now, I admit, I'm not the best player, but 1 to 2 out of every 5 deaths feels like I was cheated.\n\nThis is a cute game, though, and if you are able to drop a gamepad and walk away from a cheated death, then you can deal with this game.","January 2, 2015","true","31.5"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","20","23","0","0"

The game is very good in my opinion and honestly, made me think I was playing a type of Metroid game, has quite a lot of similarities with Metroid, achievements/challenges for beating the game in a certain time with having all items collected, items/health to be found scattered in obvious and secret areas, bosses that are needed to beat to obtain items to open the next path, even a different suit that is purple and makes you stronger and take less damage, just like the Gravity Suit. When I had gone a few rooms to the right, I instanly thought of a similarity to Brinstar on Metroid Zero Mission, Dark King's Lair reminded me of the depths of Norfair from Zero Mission and there is even one dungeon further on in the game that will reminded you of Metroid games and Tourain (you'll know when you get there.) But enough about comparing this to Metroid, this game is hard at times as some of the bosses can be tricky the first time you fight them and you will need some quick reflixes on certain areas of the game. Overall it's not bad at all, didn't think it would be as enjoyable as it is. Controls weren't hard to get used to, lots of items to collect, soundtrack was done pretty good, nice boss battles that can be difficult or easy depending on how you go about the game and what items you have, another character to play as once you beat the game with her own story as well. Achievements in this game are quite the challenge on some of them, but that's what makes the game better, so if you're the type of person who likes challenges or going for harder achievements like me, then this will be perfect for you. I will say though, this game is going to bring back the older days with me, going back to speed runs which I haven't done in a long time. Amazing game, very enjoyable and very satisfied with my purchase.","April 1, 2014","true","90.2"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","20","25","0","0"

However, it's very hard, so if you're more of a casual player you might want to download the demo first to see if it's too much for you. Also, while the new music isn't really that bad on its own, you MIGHT want to change the soundtrack to the original in the options menu; it's a whole new experience with the old music because it actually fits to the environment incredibly well, which is something the arranged versions don't do, and it also feels classic because it uses Yamaha XG as its synth, which helps in a game with this style. Of course, some music like the intro and the first area themes are changed quite a bit (probably because of copyright stuff), but it isn't too much of a problem.\n\nAlso, for those who are complaining about the controls: Git gud.

As you navigate through the labyrinth, you have to fight enemies, get through obstacles and puzzles, fight bosses and find items to power up and unlock new places to go to.\n\nThe game is a pretty solid metroidvania game. It rarely has a "What do i do next?" moment. It has no indicators as to where to go next, but the items and minimap make most of these things clear. The music is great. I liked both the original and remixed soundtrack. The game is propperly translated, which allows non-japanese players to join in on the nonsensical humor this game provides.\n\nBunny Must Die also features an unlockable second character, with her own story and gameplay mechanics, doubling the fun of this game. The story of Bunny and this other character are sequels, and explains some mysteries in Bunny her storyline. It also has some room for skipping/sequence breaking, adding some replay value for hardcore gamers. Doing so will cause certain events to act different as well (like the 1st boss getting a different dialogue and becoming more difficult).\n\nUnlike regular metroidvania games, Bunny Must Die also introduces some elements of bullet hell shooters. People who played the Gundemonium series will recognize some elements that have been copied from the other games. These extra elements make this game quite difficult on certain points. Although I wouldn't label it as insanely difficult, the game gets very tough at some later points in the game.","January 4, 2014","true","2.6"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/recommended/250660/","SamuraiVader","Samurai Vader","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/","4009 products in account","Bunny Must Die! Chelsea and the 7 Devils is a metroidvania platformer made by Platine Dispostif, who are known mainly thanks to their bullet hell games Gundemonium and Hitogata Happa. How did the developers manage the genre change?\n\nThe level design is in metroidvania style, with semi-open world where you are unlocking rooms of previous zones to progress further. What stands out with the game is definitely the sweet visual anime pixelart style that looks great, considering also the well-made animations. Chelsea and her moves look great!\n\nThe unique gameplay mechanics the game offers, is the option to control time. You can stop or rewind the time, and you'll have to use it for few puzzles; in other cases it's a great utility skill for combat. But don't expect spamming those skills, you have very limited resources to slow time, so you can't affect the time for more than few seconds.\n\nWeapon system in the game feels weird, as you are finding weapons through the levels, but you can have only one weapon at time and you can't swap to the previous weapon. You have to hope you'll find your favourite sword or boomerang soon again.\n\nWhat ruins the whole impression from the game is the controls. They are terribly clunky, you'll miss jumps pretty often. To dash, you have to quickly double tap the movement key which usually badly reacts in shorter ranges to jump. Blocking is made, as it feels like a tradition for Japanese platformers, by tapping the specific movement direction in the moment of impact.\n\nConclusion:Bunny must die, and she will die a lot. Sometimes because of higher difficulty, sometimes because you couldn't get her movement fully in control. Ability to control the time is nice but it doesn't change the fact that this is mediocre platformer with bad impression because of clunky controls.\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","January 31","false","1.3"," 24 of 42 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","24","42","0","6"

Chelsea and the 7 Devils is a 2D platforming action adventure with rigid and terrible controls that get in the way of any fun there could be. On the surface its a good looking game and I think that's all there needs to be. You fight a giant cat, you wear a bunny girl costume while platforming a labyrinth and there's a button to take a selfie screenshot. Does a game need more than that to sell it? There is plenty of old school charm with the visuals, a few items to collect like running shoes and the game's time mechanic that lets you freeze time around Bunny and halt traps. Other games have done it better, but the genre itself is popular enough where any game in it becomes a must own.\n\nWhen you start the game for the first time, you're given a choice what type of game window you'd like and you had better make the right choice because you're only asked once. Making the wrong choice gives you a black screen with music. You can sometimes remedy this by pressing Right, Right, Z and then Right, Right, Right, Up, Z. Otherwise just go digging through the game's .ini file to solve the problem. Perhaps that's a Windows 10 issue, but its still a giant issue.\n\nThe real problem is that its tough to control Bunny. Movement feels stiff and you're either attacking or moving, never both at once. There is no duck attack, but rather Bunny will attack down at an angle. She can also attack up and up at an angle. Another limitation is when you're attacking, there is no way to turn around. You need to stop attacking, move the other way and risk bumping into an enemy if they are close enough.\n\nIf you try to nudge your way off of a platform, if you do it too slight, she will correct herself back on the platform. This feels like a glitch to just disappear and move ten pixels over to safety. On the other hand, there are plenty of blind jumps with the potential for death spikes below. To compensate, you can halt all movement and push down and after a moment the screen with scroll down to show you spikes. Plus, the item icons can obscure what's below even if they're a bit transparent. The list of items seems unnecessary since you never have to switch between them.\n\nOh but then there are other blind challenges, such as flying enemies that shoot and gravity takes their projectiles downward to you. They can fire at you from off screen and it adds to the challenge, but only because movement is so stiff.\n\nOnce you earn the running shoes, you can dash with a double tap in one direction. The dash is quick and you can jump kick enemies with it, but the issue is that its easy to run by accident. Perhaps using a keyboard makes it less prone to issues, but I was using a 360 controller.\n\nBunny is a game with several weapons and she can only hold one at a time. Some are interesting, others are basic like throwing swords. Rather than a gun they are swords. She can get a slashing sword that is borderline useless since its easier to kill enemies from a distance with anything else. There are boomerangs which are always cool to have in any game and even a giant mace that will come back at you. Using the mace almost turns into an orbiting shield. The only downside is you need to catch the mace again to use it.\n\nTo get these weapons you need to break candles, which is fine because other games have done it before. The issue is if you are close enough to a candle and a weapon drops, that weapon is yours. The old weapon should be dropped so you have a choice. While weapons only pop out of specific candles I found myself getting a weapon by accident and I'd need to backtrack to get the weapon I did want.\n\nOne of the interesting facets of the game is the jump mechanic. Its just as rigid as movement, but when you just jump, its a tall jump, but when you leap in a direction, Bunny spins around. When you spin and attack she will throw weapons in a spiral. Well except the mace. The mace can destroy red projectiles, while other weapons can only take out blue ones. This is helpful for boss fights.\n\nAs for the bosses, the early fights feel laughable and easy. Just stand and spam your projectile. One boss managed to never hit me, despite standing in front of it and never moving. Perhaps that was just a boss rather than one of the 7 devils. Major bosses incorporate a cut scene, but I was never invested in the story. The title says more than what you need to know.\n\nThe time mechanic feels underutilized. Time will stop everything but Bunny and her mace. It stops your projectiles, that is except for the mace, but the catch is the mace cannot damage enemies when time is stopped. The game attempts to make more use of the time mechanic by letting you hold the button to reverse time, yet I was never able to get it to work except for a few occasions. Even then it only respawns candles and enemies I had destroyed. If there's anything that needs explaining, there are several signs with hints. Things like freeze time to jump on a platform, freeze time to disable a trap and double tap a direction to run and jump a gap.\n\nDeath in the game is a true annoyance, because its game over and you're kicked out into the main menu where you must continue from your last save. This is a ridiculous punishment for a tough to control game. I would think that a mechanic that lets you reverse time would spare you from death, but no; Bunny needs to be alive to reverse time. That feels like a missed opportunity and the entire game feels like missed opportunities. You have a time stopping mechanic yet there are no puzzles beyond find an orb to open a door. You collect items so fast and furious it makes me feel like the game is devoid of content.\n\nSaving will restore health and your time powers. When you save it adds time to your run, so for experts, there is reason to run through the game with minimal saves. Collecting purple triangles that spray out of defeated foes and candles will refill your time meter. There are a few collectibles that will increase your time meter as well.\n\nBunny Must Die! Chelsea and the 7 Devils is a game that needed more time on the fun and less time on the graphics. The art and style help sell it, but its a tough game to play or enjoy for that matter. At the price tag, a night with this bunny feels like a risky proposition.","January 19","false","1.1"," 26 of 50 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","26","50","0","4"

It is a platforming game where you explore different areas. Collecting power-ups such as dashing or wall-jumping opens up new areas of the game. Collecting different sub-weapons allows you to deal with enemies and bosses. You also have the ability to control time. You have to figure out how to progress to new areas using a combination of these elements. The puzzles that you have to solve are well thought out and give you a great sense of accomplishment once you figure them out. The game also has hidden areas and secrets that encourage players to look at every nook and cranny of the game, further extending gameplay. Enemies and bosses have a lot of charm to them despite the anime look.\n\nUnfortunately all of these great things about the game are hampered by really bad controls. I practically have a laundry list of all the problems with the controls. The following talks about my experience using a controller:\n\n-Jumping: If you are moving on the ground and then jump at the same time, you do a spin jump. When you make this jump, the height of your jump is fixed. On the other hand, if you are standing still and then jump, you can control the height of the jump and can actually jump higher than a spin jump. This can get irritating because if I'm trying to reach a high platform that is ahead of me, I have to stop, jump, and then move forward.\nAnother problem I have with jumping is the fact that while you are in the air, you can move left or right regardless of the type of jump you perform, but you cannot change the direction you are facing while in the air. This ties in to the next problem I have.\n\n-Wall jumping: When you approach a wall you want to jump on, you have to make sure that you are facing the wall when you are in the air. If you accidently fall and are trying to recover by jumping off a wall you are not facing, frustration occurs. Another problem that I personally have is that if you press the direction opposite the wall the moment after jumping off said wall, you perform a dash instead of jumping higher. This creates a problem for me because if I'm trying to getting to higher ground between two walls, I have to make sure I'm pressing the correct direction on time and make it to the walls. More often than not I perform a dash instead of jumping higher. I've seen videos of people getting higher by doing wall jumps off the same wall repeatedly, but for the life of me I cannot replicate the technique due to the precision required to perform such a move.\n\n-Attacking: With a majority of the weapons, you cannot change directions until the attack animation is done. This applies when the player is on the ground as well as in the air. What makes this inconsistent is the fact that when you are on the ground you can angle your attack upwards or downwards, but if you want to switch between left and right, you have to wait for the attack animation to finish before you can turn. You can jump while attacking but cannot move left or right. I personally feel that auto-fire is being discouraged in the game.\n\n-Blocking: This one isn't really such a big deal to me than I first thought. You have to push any direction at the moment before getting hit. I think I would prefer to have this assigned to one of the shoulder buttons instead.\n\nThis is a very fun and challenging game, and there are a lot of great things going for it. However, if I have to think about the controls all the time as I am playing it, it means that I cannot enjoy all of the other aspects of the game. The controls are inconsistent and need considerable improvement. I understand that there are people who have been able to play the game with these controls, meaning it is not impossible to complete this game 100%. This game requires a lot of practice and precision, I get it. Regardless, I cannot recommend this game unless the controls are changed.","June 19, 2014","false","3.4"," 15 of 29 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","15","29","0","3"

It is enjoyable for its audiovisual style, but only if you are accustomed to some japanese excesses - the style is bizarre and exaggerated. Even its game design is appreciable. But what ruins everything is its control and collision system. Collisions are very stiff and controls are terribly inaccurate - sometimes you'll work hard to execute some simple movements like to climb down from a platform or to turn your character in the opposite way. This aspect makes the game extremely frustrating and in my opinion destroys all the good the game could have to offer - soon things get very hard, and you won't tolerate all this impreciseness.","December 10, 2013","false","10.8"," 23 of 45 people (51%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","51","23","45","0","1"

Yeessssssss!\n\nA catgirl bunnygirl. She is normally flat, but man when she puts on that purple suit her hooters get huggggeeeee.\n\nI mean I like big breasts and curves, but them things go 'boing' and suddenly big ol tittays. Not to mention her ears are nice and adorable. The purple suit makes her 'heavier' for obvious reasons (her boobaloobs are large) which makes her capable of many things. I rather enjoy the purple suit and wish there was also a blue suit for even larger melons. I suppose the added weight might be a bit much though, but still.\n\nAlso did I mention curves too? She's gets pretty curvy. She's bordering on cute and sexy so I'm totally down with that too, but the main feature is those boobs jumping up and trying to escape her top. Everyone is staring hoping to see them slip out. Course the game isn't porn so that shouldn't happen and I'm not huge into that kind of stuff anyway. Just the lucious line in between them. Beautiful cleavage.\n\nShe has white hair. Did I mention that? Also there's other characters who are kind of hot, but I think the purple bunny suit keeps her at the 'largest', though I haven't been through the entire game so I don't know for sure. Things are kind of silly, I mean hello, giant breasts! I think I mentioned this but those boobs are great. I wish they'd bounce more when you jump. That'd be awesome and I'd record it and say 'lets see that again!' contantly.\n\n\nI didn't say anything about the actual game? Uhm...well whatever. The game doesn't matter. What really matters is busty bunny boobs.\n\nAnyway, the game plays sort of like a faster paced side scrolling platformer with minor RPG elements. The game is pretty damn good actually, but hurts my eyes are points. Music is ok, nothing amazing though. It has some odd elements in it and the story is off, but in a good kind of way. Also there's a ufo. Maybe they made the purple bunny suit? Have I mentioned her bulging breasts? Probably worth 10 bucks if you're a big side scroller fan.

It's just that the controls and the way the character handles are just so much of a puzzle to keep up with.\n\nThe game is almost literally Metroid Castlevania, and I do like these types of games. You start underpowered, unable to even walk to the right until you get a powerup... Wall candles that break to give you stuff and weapons, and upgrades that give you health, new abilities, etc.\n\nThe "story" of Bunny Devil Sin: Stacies First Day Out, is obviously purposely half ♥♥♥♥♥ as a kind of joke. Much of the intro and cutscenes and other dialogue boxes show a somewhat cheesy comedic aspect, probably designed to make fun of how ridiculous situations and universes are that a lot of video game characters live in. It's dumb, but it's meant to be dumb, and that's fine.\n\nThe graphics are very well done, nice animation and sprite work. The sound effects are OK, if a little annoying and cheesy, but the music is nice and well done.\n\nOf course though, my biggest gripe with the game is the archaic controls and movement for the player character. You can't change direction in mid-air or during a spinning jump, which means no turning around to change direction or shoot. That would normally be ok, but there are like 3 or four different kinds of jumping, with the most useful one being jumping from standing still. The sprinting/dash jump goes far but isn't tall. OK, that's understandable, but when you are walking left or right your jump will be just too short to get onto ledges for some reason, meaning you will have to run up to walls, and then stand still against them, jump, AND THEN press left or right. You can't really press any other buttons before you jump if you wanna get up, you have to jump THEN move... Which is the kind of stuff that games like Action 52 taught us was bullhonkey.\n\nThere's so many things I was irked about in just an hour of play I could probably write a million more paragraphs just about the awkward movement, but I'll at least try to wrap my qualms with the movement up. Walking to the edge of a ledge will give you a little push-back so that you don't fall off. That's cool in a lot of platformers, but there's such a large area it considers you will fall off of that it just seems more restrictive and janky than anything else. Most games would at least let one of the characters feet dangle off the ledge, but not here. You can't just start shooting to the left if you have already started shooting to the right. Once you start shooting you can hold down and aim in a couple of angles up and down. But if an enemy gets behind you as you were trying to spray at them, you have to stop shooting, finish the animation, get up, and move five feet in the other direction to turn the character around so you can shoot the other way. By that time the boss has usually done another swoop over your head back to where you were aiming before... And lastly, the multiple weapons in the game, and how you obtain them.\n\nThe variety of weapons is cool, and a lot of them have various uses... but... The way that you get them is so obtuse that you will go out of your way to try NOT to get the next new weapon since you don't even know when you will get it, or how useful it will be. Weapons drop out of a certain few candles mixed into the environment along with ones that recharge time meter stuff, but they don't look any different than the normal ones, and once you pick up that weapon you are stuck with it until you either find a new one or go back to a candle you've memorized has a weapon, and get it back there. I understand that this mechanic is basically just Castlevania, but it seems like a decent idea from Castlevania that was just taken and poorly implemented. This game isn't arcade-y at all really, and the weapon you pick up is your ONLY weapon, not a secondary one. If the candles looked different than the others, or you could keep and switch through them, or something... It's just such a weird choice to have certain weapons only hidden in certain candles in certain places and once you pick one up you can't even change it unless you backtrack.\n\nI think my last gripe along with all of that, is just that every time you die it kicks you back to the main menu. Why. Having to do everything again from your last save-point is fine... But why do I have to go back to the main menu to load them? Why not just respawn at them right after you die...\n\nOverall, it IS a good game, just... uh... not for me I guess... The controls and movement physics are just too puzzling and confusing to really get a hang of for me, and it's almost like every mechanic of this game was designed to stop the flow of combat and platforming that would normally be in a game like Metroid. It's expected to go fast a lot of the time, but you are made to stop every five seconds to correct a jump, or kill an annoying enemy, or to just try to figure out one simple thing that shouldn't be so complicated when plenty of other games did the same stuff so fluently... Ah well.\n\nOh yeah, and theres this time stopping/reversing mechanism, but it's just not too... enticing or incentivizing to use. Stopping time runs out very quickly, controls are still as clunky as before, you can't attack, and you can still be damaged. Reversing time doesn't seem to have much of a use outside of a few puzzles that have doors close too quickly to run through. You can't even rewind time to revive yourself.\n\nJust too clunky of an action platformer for me. I'm sure the mechanics and controls can be memorized and perfected through time, but I'm an easily confused individual and even if I did memorize them I would constantly be miss-pressing and messing up things. Though even memorization of the controls still wouldn't rectify some of the other questionable issues that this game has.","January 29","false","1.2"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

What you don't expect however is that it gets incredibly difficult really fast. Coupled with the large map, exciting music, and awesome visuals, this game is definitely worth the price, sale or not.\n\nIn terms of graphics, it's what pixel-based games should at least strive for. It's got depth, color, proportion, and detail; all things you'd see in 3D materials. Instead of going for realism, it aims for an eastern style similar to anime. While a turnoff for some, it's an interesting addition to the crazy details of other things in the area. The contrast between cute and girly and the detailed and fearsome monsters is easy to enjoy. There is one enemy who has two different appearances, one being a photo-realistic cat, and the other being a cartoony cat. You can choose the original or remastered versions in the options, with the photo-realistic cat being the original.\n\nIn terms of music, it's hit or miss. The original soundtrack is amazing, having what sounds like midi music rather than orchestrated, while the remastered music is orchestrated with little hints of the original. I personally did not like the remastered music, as the original definitely sounded better in the settings. Both soundtracks differ, but you are bound to like one or the other, maybe both and never neither.\n\nEnemy variety is a bit lacking, as there's many reskinned pumpkin and clay zombie monsters. Likewise, there's two or three different colored turrets that shoot differently, and two spider tanks that do different attacks. Bosses have unique designs, and are pretty interesting. From a hot-headed fairy to a realistic cat, all the way to a girl with a pumpkin on her head. Let's not even talk about the nudist vampire with a revolver for a haircut, nor the tank you'd see in a bullet hell game. The bosses more than make up for the lack of fodder enemies.\n\nThe puzzles are surprisingly easy, but many times you will flip out trying to figure out what to do. The use of dash, wall jump, and time stopping are almost required to do some puzzles, and then there's puzzles that require timed jumps, pausing and reversing time multiple times, and my favorite one; bouncing off of enemy heads over a lake of blue fire to get to a door that seals if you take any damage in that room. There's even hidden blocks that you will likely not expect, so walk against every wall to find them!\n\nNow we come to the bad aspects of the game.\n\nControls. While limited to movement, jumping, attacking, and time power, there is a combo system that lets you control which time power to use by simply changing how you move, provided you have the powerup. Healing and slow motion time are the most valuable powers, and turning into Dynamite Bunny is also handy. How can these be bad? Because you have to be facing where you want to go every time. You can't dash until you turn and face where you want to go, you can't jump on enemy heads when spin jumping, you have to make sure that you time your movements and turns, and so on. There's also an ability that lets you block all damage, even from those spike pits. Only problem is that it randomly works, and never when you want it to.\n\nWhile I said it was a good aspect, some puzzles have "You are stupid" mechanics. There's a point where, to open a door, you have to place an item in a place you can't even see. In no way is it obvious, nor is there any hint of what to do. The worst puzzle is a hallway with an endless supply of invincible robot rabbits; you NEED to use a specific order of time abilities to prevent them from spawning, but as I pointed out in controls, it's incredibly difficult to do. If you have enough max health, you can just brute force your way through by dashing constantly after being hit, but that's definitely not the intended way.\n\nStory. NOTHING makes any sense. Game is supposed to be nonsensical, but for the sake of completing a full review, I'll touch on it. You play as Bunny, a bunny girl who was cursed with cat ears. She goes with a fat rabbit to the game's dungeon, and has to defeat seven devils to get rid of her curse. Fun fact; there's only 6 bosses, and the last boss is entirely unrelated to Bunny's plight. I will avoid spoilers, so I won't reveal who the villain at the end is, but if you have earned all the time power ups, you outright cancel the entire game's story. Not exactly a spoiler since it unlocks another game mode, but I'll stop here. Haven't beaten the second story, and doubt I will. It's absolutely hard.\n\nOverall, I'd give this game an 8/10.

For a game with a similar premise where the controls are actually responsive, check out Rabi-Ribi instead.\n\nEDIT To expand on the problems a bit after spending a bit longer with the game:\n\nThe problem is the mechanics of the controls.  In particular:\n\nFirst, when in an attack animation, including after releasing the attack button for most of a second, the character can't turn around, and the game ignores any attempt to do so.  This means that attempts to attack, stop attacking, and turn around, and then attack again often result in the second attack going the wrong direction because the directional input wasn't accepted.\n\nSecond, the character doesn't stop moving in the air when you release the directional input.  You can turn them around by pressing the opposite direction, but the only way to jump off a platform and fall straight down onto one directly below is to do an incredibly awkward zig-zag, pressing left and right repeatedly all the way down.  This mechanic alone makes the platforming sections of the game way harder than they need to be.\n\nEither of these flaws taken alone would seriously reduce the enjoyability of the game, but taken together they are a total deal-breaker.  They're both awful design choices for a platformer, and they go directly against the expectations set by nearly every other game in the genre.\n\nBeyond the controls themselves, the game has a few other more forgivable flaws.  For example, it lacks any "continue" or "reload from checkpoint" facility.  In a game where death is frequent and expected, going through the extra two or three screens to load your save game from the title screen every time gets annoying quickly.  Also, as other reviews have noted, the weapon-switching system is based on random pick-ups that essentially erase your current weapon, many of them in central areas.  This often creates annoying avoid-the-powerup puzzles when you are simply trying to explore but don't want to lose your current weapon.","May 19","false","3.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","3"

This is both a bit accurate and inaccurate.\n\nThe controls are NOT impercise, they are high high percision;\nYou can also easily make your character do many things: 'bunny' jump up, foward, and backwards, spin jump, attack up, foward, & diagonally, duck, dash, dash attack.\nThe problem is a number of those manuvers require very percise button presses, and the controls are also setup so that the character will 'commit' to some actions, so you can't quickly cancel it to do another action.\nThis can make the contols feel *unresponsive*, if you do things by refex and get a button press wrong.\nFor those of you who remember, it is similar to the problems in Super Metroid in making a spin vs. regular jump, or in Symphony of the Night and accidentally doing Alucards reverse mini-dash thingy, except a bit more unforgiving.\nI'm pretty sure it was an intentional choice in how to setup the controls, they want to award percisely controlling the character.\n\nExample: Try to turn the character around and do a spin jump (jump and push forward same time), what actually happens is you do a backward jump (jump and push bacward same time), what you need to do is turn, then spin jump.\n\n","November 27, 2014","true","4.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I love it! When I started playing this I had time to get use to the controls and got confortble with a fun but silly sort of funny story line. Boss fights to remember! The stages were good desgin and enjoyed the game play not really flustered when dieing over and over but actaully having mutiple stragies plan to use during each boss fight ready because it wasn't trying to shove everything diffcult right away and wasn't giving a easy small enemy. Which what made me love this game so much! Using out of battle items was fun and some of the abilitties gotten weren't nicely placed. The game had somewhat really easy platforming at the beginning. I think the sound was  game was great! the music, I thought it not really good.  I thought the first item you get in the game was funny and great idea to start out with. I enjoyed the backround at times because it felt like it was apart of the story and I thought that was unique. The weapons you got to pick up would give a disadvantage on what your trying to do or a huge advantage. If you enjoy to a 2D platformer that is somewhat diffcult and takes skill and gives a classic game feel, then this game you would enjoy more. I give this 1 out of 10 a 8, I love it and I wasn't  disapointed at all. It gives the player a good time in all. I just, find the game to be more of a good qeust to enjoy. an okay amount of space to roam for half of the game.\n","January 17, 2014","true","6.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The dashing relies on a double tap which works 50% of the time you NEED it to, and 50% when you need it to NOT dash.\n\nJumping is also painful, as the game relies on several different jumps: jumping from a standstill, jumping while moving, jumping while dashing, and an attack kick which is an attack while dashing. Again, the dash jumps are painful because dashing barely works but jumping also sometimes doesn't react well when you need it. Also, jumping from a standstill has just a little more height than jumping while moving, and the game WILL require this. It makes trying to move through some parts really frustrating as you need to stop moving (and dodging!) to get a fraction more of an inch in your height to get to where you need to go.\n\nYou'll stick to ledges of platforms your standing on, which works out okay when you want to stay on a platform, but it will magnetically pull you when you want to jump down past it, or throw you off small platforms when you attempt to land on them. Just.. infuriating when this part goes wrong.\n\nThe fighting is fine, there are different weapons which feel great, the art is light-hearted and whimscle, and the game has clever time-manipulation puzzles, but I just can't recommend it due to the fact I want to break my controller in half when the game doesn't recognize my input to do a sequence of very precise moves, which is 90% of this game. 6/10","January 10, 2015","false","2.5"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

This game is a really fun "Metroidvania-style" game. There are numerous upgrades to collect throughout the journey, but not all of them are necessary--Heck, you can even complete the game without the joke-upgrade that lets you turn around.\n\nThe gameplay is very fast-paced and not too forgiving about mistakes. You later gain the ability to use your extra lives, but until that point you're pretty much on your own. That's not really a bad thing. The bosses are challenging enough that having something to lose REALLY makes it feel worth the time spent when you actually beat them.\n\nAnother thing I love about this title is that it is so flexible about how you complete it. At least in Bunny's story, you can often do the bosses out of order, and they will change depending on what you do first. I actually managed to goof up a save-file doing this though. The first boss does NOT like to be defeated second. I couldn't beat her in pissy-mode.\n\nAnyway, my rambling aside, I love this game and I'm glad it's on Steam. If you like exploring a huge maze-like map while searching for upgrades, battling hilarious yet difficult bosses, and following a goofy storyline that somehow drags you in despite its lack of seriousness, then you'll love this game.\n\nNow if only I could figure out how I beat this thing in the first place.

Not nescissarily broken but just poorly executed. Unlike defining games of the genre, Super Metroid ans Super Castlevania 4, which ease you into the game and are more or less well scaled difficulty that challenges what you've learned in previous areas, this game gives you two or three screens to aquire the skills you need to face the first boss. After the aforementioned screens it basically turns into a Super Meat Boy/Touhou/Kaizo hybrid without any of the awesome game mechanics in any of the games mentioned.\n\nThe shooting is cumbersome, at least on keyboard, And kinda hard to get used to in the SIX FIRGGIN SCREENS YOU HAVE TO DO SO!!! Super Metroid did have a similar 8 direction shooting mechanic, but at no point did you have to fight Flandre Scarlet with only one HP upgrade. This wouldn't be such a big deal if there was auto-fire like in, I don't know, most bullet hell shmups that let you fight back. To bring back metroid, the first major fight, Ridley, can be challenging but nothing you can't deal with because they hid the tutorial in the opening level and you are competent in basic combat  because of that.\n\nKeep in mind, I don't hate rediculously difficult games. In fact, Super Meat Boy is probably my favorite platformer. But what do all good insanely difficult games have in common? The answer, make death painless (Super Meat Boy), Funny (AVGN Adventures), or preface the game with the prospect of thousands of deaths (Dark Souls). Maybe it's because I grew up with games where death was an actual setback, but I kind of expect one of those three things in games where I can't expect not to die multiple times in the first 20 minutes of the game on a first playthrough. Deaths are supposed to tell you that you did something at least a little more stupid than not memorizing attacks, in this sense if you could take more than about 4 hits from the first boss, this might be more tolerable as you could get some bearing. Harking back to Super Meat Boy, technically, only the boss of chapter 4 is trial and error, everything else, with good reaction and recognising what does what, you could get through 99% of the levels in one life... if you're good enough.\n\nI also by no means hate anime esq art styles. what with skullgirls being my favorite head to head fighter. In fact in games that have them, they're often done remarkably well, including here. But the difference between SkullGirls and this atrocity  is that SkullGirls actually has good gameplay to back it up\n\nTwo last complaints: Soundtrack is lackluster and Chelsea is sounds about as grating as just about any character in any game I have played.","December 1, 2014","false","0.4"," 5 of 15 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","5","15","0","2"

Its a castlevania 1 clone through and through.\n\nEvery single problem i have with this game could of been avoided if it was properly playtested, really unresponsive and clunky flow. unfair deaths all over the place, saves in almost every room to make it playable, useless secrets, linear, dumb story, unbalanced weapons, filled with bugs everywhere, buggy timestop function, extremely irritating voices.\n\nYou have no freedom at all to explore since there is only 1 right way to go, there is no secrets that has any meaning at all because every single secret up to this point has been extra lives which are useless when there is a save in every 2-3 rooms. You get different keys after killing a boss, these keys are used to open a door on the other side of the map of where you fought boss so backtrack through where you just came to unlock the next area, when you have finished that area it will loop back so you can pick up that same key and use again DO NOT FORGET TO BRING THE KEY AGAIN OR YOU WILL HAVE TO RETURN AGAIN!\n\nThe bosses and mosters have patterns, but because of the horrendus control, its almost impossible to properly react to these patterns. Which turns every bossfight into a buttonmasher where you hope for the best. Worst part is, this tactic works 40% of the time too. The platforming when backtracking through areas you have already been is harder then every boss so far.\n\nI am hessitant if i should finish this game or not, and this I'm saying as a avid metroidvania fanboy. This game is not metroidvania whatsoever, its everything bad about castlevania 1 thrown into a game with great art, music and animations.\n\nI do not recommend this game to even the most dedicated metroidvania type lover. The only people who should play this is those who like the frustration of castlevania 1, without the satisfaction of actually completing something. To these people i would recommend buying it on sale when its 80% off, everybody else should stay away. Do not support the release of such buggy garbage with your money","December 30, 2014","false","2.8"," 5 of 17 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","5","17","0","0"

It has the most awkward clunky controls i've played since bad NES games. You will likely die from the controls more than anything else, or if you get stuck with a terrible weapon for a difficult area. the time mechanic is badly implemented as well, it has a very selective effectiveness, some areas it works, others it won't. It also takes forever to recharge it and it doesn't last very long.\n\nThere are some positive aspects of the game. the graphics and music are amazing, but that's about it. the bosses are easy, most of the enemies are easy and you will be seeing the same enemies through out most of the game. Spikes instant kill you at the beginning of the game, and the first area is loaded with them.\n\nMost of the game you will be struggling to jump through all the platforming sections, there are also some very strict timing areas for switch activated doors, which time stopping does not work on. You can reverse time a few seconds once you get that ability but it's still very strict timing in most areas.\n\nOverall i rage quit this game due to long stretches of platforming and laser-blasting enemies with too few checkpoints. the game isn't fun mostly due to bad level design and awful controls.

The gimmick I am really taking the stab at most here is the perfect guard, there's quite a few secrets in the game that demand perfect guard vs "instant" (high damage but for the first half of the game it may as well be instant) death spikes which I found a little demanding on a game where I've had the game I've had the guard fail many times.\n\nThe time mechanics for bunny on the other hand work quite fine and are responsive in what they do but still may frustrate players as some puzzles that use the time gimmick can be quite demanding on skill and may deter people. I've not gotten to try "spoilers" game play yet to make an opinion on it yet.\n\nThe official state side release came with a few perks which included arranged music, and a overhaul to a few bosses to make it feel less low budget doujin. This are a few nice touches to sweeten the deal if you can survive the mechanics to experience them.","July 10, 2014","false","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story isn't incredibly important, and the writing seems to be self-referential to the point were the game knows this too. It's funny, but ultimately you're there to murder everything you see.\n\nAs for gameplay itself, it has the standard jumping, moving, attacking actions of any metroidvania, as well as some added techniques. In total, there are 6 weapons, each which different effects and powers that distinguish them from each other. No two weapons feel the same, which is good. The most interesting mechanic BMD! has is its time warping functionality : Bunny is capable of stopping time, allowing her to move past enemies, do specific platforming things, and as she collects more Yellow Powder, rewind time, heal herself, and more.\n\nTrue to any Metroidvania, Bunny encounters a variety of power-ups along her adveture, ranging from the ability to turn Right to wall-jumping, and even a suit that increases her bust size, giving her added offensive capabilities and slower movement. Not going to lie, it's pretty funny.\n\nAs hinted at from above the line, BMD! is hard. Hellaciously hard, even. This is in part due to its steep difficult in platforming and overall difficult boss fights [which are equally as absurd as Bunny herself], but also to the game's most fatal flaw : the movement controls. Jumping is a feat in of itself. The entire system feels very clunky, and oftentimes, you might perform a somersault when you meant to do a straight jump, end up falling down a long tower shaft, and being forced to climb up again. Enemies also inflict a knockback when you're hurt, lending to frustrating moments [in particular, the Jade Tower comes to mind.] However, the controls aren't terrible, and can be surmounted with enough practice.\n\nThe game's art and soundtrack are delightful. Environments and enemies look nice and distinct, and each musical score, while nothing particularly catchy or memorable, is nice to listen to. Bunny's voice acting is also pretty solid, but it should be noted that it is in Japanese. The game runs phenomenally well. In my experience, I encountered no graphical slow down, even with dozens of fireballs on the screen at once.\n\nA minor issue is that, should you play this game on Windows 10, you have to edit the game's configuration files to fix the window, otherwise it's just a black screen. It's annoying, but once it's fixed, it's gone.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOverall Rating\n7.3/10\n\nBunny Must Die! is an overall enjoyable experience.

The story isn't incredibly important, and the writing seems to be self-referential to the point were the game knows this too. It's funny, but ultimately you're there to murder everything you see.\n\nAs for gameplay itself, it has the standard jumping, moving, attacking actions of any metroidvania, as well as some added techniques. In total, there are 6 weapons, each which different effects and powers that distinguish them from each other. No two weapons feel the same, which is good. The most interesting mechanic BMD! has is its time warping functionality : Bunny is capable of stopping time, allowing her to move past enemies, do specific platforming things, and as she collects more Yellow Powder, rewind time, heal herself, and more.\n\nTrue to any Metroidvania, Bunny encounters a variety of power-ups along her adveture, ranging from the ability to turn Right to wall-jumping, and even a suit that increases her bust size, giving her added offensive capabilities and slower movement. Not going to lie, it's pretty funny.\n\nAs hinted at from above the line, BMD! is hard. Hellaciously hard, even. This is in part due to its steep difficult in platforming and overall difficult boss fights [which are equally as absurd as Bunny herself], but also to the game's most fatal flaw : the movement controls. Jumping is a feat in of itself. The entire system feels very clunky, and oftentimes, you might perform a somersault when you meant to do a straight jump, end up falling down a long tower shaft, and being forced to climb up again. Enemies also inflict a knockback when you're hurt, lending to frustrating moments [in particular, the Jade Tower comes to mind.] However, the controls aren't terrible, and can be surmounted with enough practice.\n\nThe game's art and soundtrack are delightful. Environments and enemies look nice and distinct, and each musical score, while nothing particularly catchy or memorable, is nice to listen to. Bunny's voice acting is also pretty solid, but it should be noted that it is in Japanese. The game runs phenomenally well. In my experience, I encountered no graphical slow down, even with dozens of fireballs on the screen at once.\n\nA minor issue is that, should you play this game on Windows 10, you have to edit the game's configuration files to fix the window, otherwise it's just a black screen. It's annoying, but once it's fixed, it's gone.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOverall Rating\n7.3/10\n\nBunny Must Die! is an overall enjoyable experience. Aside from its wonky controls, the gameplay is simple and fun, offering fast action and hair-trigger timing. The game is rather short, and can be beaten in as little as an hour [the game even has an achievement for doing so!], but that detail is offset by the fact it has an additional mode in which you play as a different character, who plays almost entirely differently.

At first glance, it appears to be a Metroid-inspired platformer/exploration game. You move around, explore a 2D labyrinth, collect powerups, and fight monsters. However, this game just doesn't give me the satisfaction that you'd get from your typical metroid game. First off, you can't fire your weapon while moving, unless you're pulling off an aerial maneuver, and that gets old fast. It limits your options for attacking enemies while on the go, and enemies in this game will be guaranteed to get a few hits off on you before you can kill them. The environments you fight in are also tightly cramped, a little too much for comfort. As for bosses, the game doesn't really offer much there. Some are pretty tough, but I was able to cheese several bosses in by just getting up tot hem and shooting, and their AI couldn't make heads or tails regarding how to attack me.  Poorly coded if you ask me.\n\nOverall, big disappointment in my eyes. I see alot of other people in these comments enjoy the game, which is a-okay by me. I just can't personally invest too much time into it, which is why I requested a refund.  It's so puzzling too, since I like the rest of the games from this developer. Guess platforming metroidvanias aren't their strong suit.","June 22, 2015","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/breadsandwich/recommended/250660/","breadsandwich","Slow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/breadsandwich/","914 products in account","This game is a metroidvania, in the spirit of the handheld console Castlevania games. Its major differences lie in the art style of the main characters, which more closely resemble popular Japanese doujinshi characters, and the movement mechanics of the character.\nI liked the style of the MC, Bunny, the aesthetics of the areas, and the cat boss, which led me to buy this game.\nThe primary difference between the handheld Castlevanias' and this game's movement mechanics seems to be that this game is noticeably more rigid in where the character model is allowed to stand or land. Moving to the very edge of a platform in this game will cause the character to snap back away from the edge of the platform tile. The jumping physics also more resemble Cave Story's than Castlevania's, since more emphasis is placed on acceleration. Castlevania games allow more crisp turning/jumping commands and have less acceleration in their normal jumping physics, which is probably because characters don't jump as high in Castlevania games.\nPlatforming in Bunny's storyline with the 360 controller was difficult because dashing is activated with two clicks left or right, but when using the controller's analog stick, I would cause Bunny to dash inadvertently, or not dash at all, making her fall to her spikey death many times (and causing me much frustration). Other mechanics, like short wall hops and time-reversal courses, added to the difficulty.\nThe bosses are much more do-able than the platforming, provided one has the right weapons, which are found by breaking lamps. Bunny's interactions with bosses were amusing, though she's quite the crass lass for indiscriminately defeating them (among other reasons, including her speech mannerisms). In the end, however, she redeems herself (though you have to beat Chelsea's story for that, which I haven't).\nI've read that Chelsea's playstyle is very different (and probably mitigates the hard platforming parts seen in Bunny's mode), so I'm gonna get started on that right away.\n\nUpdate: Chelsea's playstyle is indeed very different. I had an faster time completing her mode; her ladder and floaty jumps made areas more accessible, and normal bosses are not as difficult as Chelsea, though this could just be due to my experience gained playing Bunny's mode. Chelsea's final boss fights are harder than Bunny's,  because with Bunny's fights, you can heal up to full HP in around the middle of the series.  With Chelsea,  not only is there no healing in the middle, but there a section of the boss fight series where Bunny jumps around, seemingly randomly, flinging swords that 1-hit KO; any death in the series will result in losing at least 1/2 of all of her "lives".\n\nWith that said, this game was pretty satisfying to beat, and I would rank it among my favorite metroidvanias/2d platformers.","January 28, 2015","true","21.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
