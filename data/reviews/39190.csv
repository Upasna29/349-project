To most people, yes. To some people who only favor the new generation of video games... Not so much.\n\nDungeon Siege is mainly a game you would play for nostalgia; or if you're just a fan of mysterious, old school RPGs that don't hold your hand or if you're just a RPG collector in the first place, and seek a new game to add to your collection.\n\nSince Dungeon Siege was the first game I ever played, my review may bare some bias: but hopefully, that shall not be the case.\n\nDungeon Siege MIGHT not have the most advanced combat system, but with the amount of interesting characters you can control (8 at maximum, if I'm correct) such as a dwarf, an archer, a alcoholic yet skilled warrior and even a half giant (in the expansion pack!) you can create a team of adventurers with all kinds of strategy and you can find and loot all kinds of accoutrement to independantly equip each party member you are controlling.\n\nThe game may seem very linear at first but if you're willing to playthrough the game over one time you'll discover many secret locations and party members which you may not have discovered from the first playthrough, something special Dungeon Siege always captured me with was the mystery. SPOILER ALERT: In one area, you find extremely large (seemingly dragon) bones... Who knows what that was before it died? I suppose we'll never know.\n\nYou have three classes: Melee, Ranged or Magic. There are many spells, swords (or even clubs or hammers or axes) and bows (or crossbows in the expansion pack) to collect, and a large amount of armor to follow.\n\nNot to mention the brilliant voice acting and enchanting sound effects which if you played Dungeon Siege awhile ago shall capture your heart with nostalgia.\n\nDungeon Siege is overall an AMAZING game. The first playthrough you will find incredible since you won't know what to expect, then there's always the expansion. The only complaints I have is that the multiplayer is disabled, I wish there were more party members and it wasn't as linear (The secret locations and party members does get slightly limited, there are many side quests though too!)\n\nThe final verdict for Dungeon Siege is... A 8 out of 10. The game is incredible (a 10/10 for the first playthrough) but there are a few flaws that could keep someone from playing.\n\nUntil the next review, seeya!","November 7, 2014","true","11.2"," 87 of 92 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","87","92","4","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/39190/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2816 products in account","Dungeon Siege was one of my favourite games growing up. This is a Diablo like dungeon crawler, action RPG hack and slash.\n\nYou start out with one character, which you create yourself in classic RPG fashion, and set out on your journey. Along the linear path, you meet you adventures who will join your party, by the end of the game you will have up to eight different party members, and there are three different classes which your characters can take the role of, melee, range and mage. I found the melee and range characters levelled up a lot quicker than the mage but it didn't seem to make that much difference in the grand scheme of things.\n\nYou can really get into micromanaging your party once you get a couple of members, the game allows you to pause real time action to let you give orders for your characters. You can also just sit back and let the AI work it out with the very initiative behaviour system; you can set each characters default behaviour for certain circumstances which gives you the hands off approach.\n\nThe graphics show their thirteen year age here; although back when this game was originally released, this was one of the best looking games of its time. Bare that in mind before you judge the pixels!\n\nThe game play is very linear, there is no reason to back track in this game as enemies do not respawn, and you just need to push on forward. The zones are nicely put together, with lots of different hidden areas off the main track, allowing you to explorer and find hidden treasures or maybe a small side boss.  The dungeons themselves are massive, you can find yourself getting lost in all of the corridors; this isn't a bad thing though as you just keep on squishing all the enemies till you find your path again. You are playing a dungeon crawler, so you should expect that.\n\nI've been playing Dungeon Siege for about twenty odd hours now, this was to complete the whole game including side quests; as with all games of this type, it's highly recommended you do these as they give you extra rewards and more story to immerse yourself in.\n\nEven on newer operating systems I didn't have any technical issues, it was a shame I couldn't ramp the resolution right the way up, but I am sure if you look out there you can find mods that allow you to do so.\n\nIn this day and age, Dungeon Siege will only appeal to a certain audience, newer gamers will probably instantly dislike it because of the way it looks. However, if you want to try out a classic RPG game with tons of content, then Dungeon Siege is a pretty good starting point which you won't be disappointed in.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Although it requires some coaxing to get functional on a modern OS it has aged remarkably well and mainly only suffers from somewhat wonky controls (which get worse when you've more party members to manage), a rather awkward camera, and some exception crashes; though in my case that last one plagued the bandit cave area so horribly that it effectively ended my campaign, so your mileage may vary.\n\nGraphics: The graphics are still pretty passable and in some cases still quite beautiful, no complaints aside from character display UI issues in the inventory screen probably caused by playing on a higher resolution than the game was designed for. Throughout the game, a fairly dark, earthy theme is most-often employed.\n\nSound: The game features an excellent, genre-appropriate, soundtrack composed by Jeremy Soule (Morrowind, Oblivion, Knights of the Old Republic...) but has some weird sound effects issues wherein an item drop sound may play when no items are dropped. Some basic, often unconvincing, voice acting is employed for important characters.\n\nStory: A pretty standard fantasy storyline that doesn't really stand out in any way, although it's not unbearable, it is very linear and can get boring pretty quickly, making it hard to play for extended periods of time. Characters are very basic, as seems very common amongst Action RPGs.\n\nThis reviewer gives Dungeon Siege: 7/10","April 27, 2014","true","37.9"," 36 of 39 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","36","39","0","0"

The story isn't as well executed as BG, but better Than most Dungeon bashers. Voice acting is minimal, but competent, just enough to give a little flavour and highlight major plot points.\nWhat you get, though, is A HELL of a dungeon basher, Amazing atmosphere and tension a load of options for selecting your squad and what skills and equipment they take with them, and a horde of enemies more than capable of taking you down if you get sloppy. Watch every step, keep an ear out for ambient sounds which may be clues of a coming ambush, and don't rush in to grab loot unless you're sure your exit is clear!\nRPG aspects are a bit like the Elder Scrolls series, you get better at what you do most, and the skills that go with that.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/recommended/39190/","Whiteswart","Whiteswart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/","1424 products in account","Dungeon Siege is an old isometric action-RPG. It was quite original for the wanna-beat-Diablo game of year 2003, but now it can attract only a small group of players with the taste for "old-school games". With the slight remark that DS is not as much old-school, being just an Arpg (with emphasis on Action and not RPG).\n\nHowever, for an action-rpg it has very promising setting, with the story based on the heritage of the legion of a great empire, lost in the world of magic, and, the most noticeable - the clever system of character grading, where you "levelling" your heroes only when using specific skills. Shoot the bow - become dexterous archer, cast spells - and take a gain in "intelligence" and magic power. Or, well, just bash'em all with a stick or shovel - as you start your adventure with the "child of farmer lost his home" background.\n\nOther than character evolution, Dungeon Siege "key features" are not likely to take your interest, as following the story turns out too thankless task. Well, unless we return to the levelling system - as there you can hire companions (up to 7) and train them to fit your tactics. So you can gather a somewhat standard band, like 2 melee, 2 archers, 2 mages, 2 healers... or to mix all the roles at your leasure. You can even hire 7 mules to carry your stuff, and fight your way all alone... if you that attracted to the DS, which I doubt.\n\nOh, well. Do I like Dungeon Siege? Sure, it brings some memories, and it is still not bad, if you know the drill. The interface was fine back in time, and it is still quite easy to get along. Although... the gameplay not aged that well, for my tastes. What was quite alright in time between Diablo 1 and 2, now feels... too plain. Bland even.\n\nCan I recommend it to the people who are new to the plethora of games, made more than 10 years back? Barely. People, who started to play in time of Mass Effect rising, certainly will be having hard times motivating themselves to play Dungeon Siege I. It was good back then, but now... now it's worth buying only if you know already what you're getting yourself into.\n\nNostalgia project, with personal mark 7/10 - for the fun time back in the days.

I suppose one can put this down to ones tastes getting more refined as one ages and a classic example of this is going back to old childhood movies that delighted and thrilled as a youngster only to be re-watched as an adult and  then wondering what on earth all the fuss was about.\n\nFor the most part Dungeon Siege holds up pretty well though when gazing upon it with modern eyes. I don't remember being particularly disappointed the way the game unfolded when I played it the first time around 12 years ago but 12 years later I couldn't help but feel that the game somewhat looses its focus about halfway through the campaign. Being much older now I suppose this is to be expected somewhat.\n\nDungeon Siege sees you take control of a motley band of adventurers task to eliminate yet another clichéd fantasy trope - an uprising - of goblins in the Kingdom of Ebb. The game still holds up relatively well though considering its age and the first half is a tense filled journey but alas the same can't be said for the latter part as the game winds down to a rather limp and weak ending.\n\nBut as far as titles go that are shrouded in the fog of nostalgia, Dungeon Siege is still a relatively rocking good time to re-experience.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","November 28, 2013","true","33.1"," 44 of 67 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","44","67","0","6"

EDIT: Game is of quite sufficient length.  Longest mazes I've ever played.]\n\nFun game from 2002.  I started as a huge Diablo 2 fan.  I'm catching up and enjoying the era of now-cheap RPG/action games before upgrading my system to run more modern games.   Just so I don't spend before I really need to.  (currently a Radeon X-600)  This includes the Dungeon Siege series + Fallout, Torment, Torchlight 1/2, Baldur's Gate, Titan Quest, Morrowind, Oblivion ...before hitting Skyrim, D3, etc.  Bottom line: In many ways, this fits in the older era.  -- So, those are your ganeral Action/RPG + hack/slash comparisons.\n\n** Graphics:  It's 3-D.  Steam graphics are representative.  Sure, it's dated, but that doesn't ruin the game for me.\n\n** Team: You can manage 8 characters drawn from three general classes from which you can customize: Melee, ranged, mage.   Two kids of mages: Combat, Nature.  Former is mostly offensive; the latter mainly includes healing spells, etc.   Buffs and spell selection are typical.\n\n** Multiplayer: No multiplayer anymore.\n\n** Loot: Regular items for purchase and souped up loot (some has tradeoffs).  One of your 8 chars can be a moving mule: non fighting with 3 times inventory.  ... One /very/ cool minor feature is casting a "transmute" spell that turns items into gold on the spot at a fraction of the value.  Thus, there's no need to leave loot unless you want to leave mapping markers or don't want to bother with the super-cheap stuff.  Obviously, take the valuable stuff, right?  :)\n\n** Overview of Attributes with examples: 3 areas: Strength (perks: melee combat damage, eventually wear better armor), Dex (ranged damage), Intel (mana pool, spell damage, mage armor).  -- Dex provides minimal advantages.\n\n** Character development is actually more complex than usual.  Use a melee weapon, you build strength.  -- but you also gain a slight boost in dex and a very slight intel boost.  Reverse is true.  This enables your ranged character to VERY gradually build strength for slightly better armor.  Although you delay advanced specializion perks, I like a little flexibility.\n\n[EDIT: Recommendation: Specialization for fighters.  Don't broaden their attributes/abilities beyond strength.  ...Be very cautious about mage/fighters.]\n\n** Replayability?  The only replayability factors would be different party composition, which IMO is little to none.  No randomness at all.  I think it's a great one and done.\n\n** Monsters: Once you clear an area, the monsters don't respawn.  I expect that next game, they'll be in the same place.\n\n** Other: You can remap keys like a bandit.  Haven't even explored all the options.  Raise/lower difficulty.  Standard quests.  Quick save along the way.  Secret areas that aren't easy to find without advice?  You can get an overview map, but it does NOT show caves since they're underground.  Sometimes unlit areas aren't obvious, both of which are authentic and nice touches.  I'll investigate mods later, if they exist.\n\nEDIT: Just completed the game (12/12/14).  This game has a let-down for an ending.  Still worth the purchase, but oh my goodness, Steam version has removed all sense of closure!  Does this matter?  Think of it as a 98% great game, and subsequently see a therapist for any emotional damage.\n\n** Advice: If you like the standard old ARPG like the above, get this game.  Cheap Steam bundles are occasionally available at humblebundle, gamersgate, bundlestar, etc.  Probably will hit gog soon if you want no DRM.

You can level up all the way to 150! You have 4 diffrent skills which you can upgrade. You can be tons of diffrent classes based on the skills you upgraded. You can get magic items based on the rarity:\n\n➴ Normal (No Color)\n➴ Magic (Blue)\n➴ Exotic? (Brown)\n➴ Rare (Purple)\n➴ Legendary (Yellow)\n\nIn the singleplayer campaign, you can buy mercaneries-for-hire and packmules to come along with you in your adventure to find out why humanity is being attacked by other races they allied with. You are a farmer who goes on a marvelous (and yet long) adventure to find out why Huminity is threatened and crush the threat before it destroys humanity.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pibz/recommended/39190/","Pibz","Cap'n Red Ivan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pibz/","348 products in account","NOTE: this game as far as I can tell is one of the most sporadic games on Steam. For some people, the game doesn't work at all. Others cant play in high resolutions, others can't get the multiplayer to work, and others can't get the expansion to work. I personally was able to get the game running (turn your shadows down btw) flawlessly, and I was able to bruteforce anti aliasing with Nvidia control panel, so the game looks great for 2002. Your mileage will more than likely vary.\n\nDungeon Siege is a fantasy ARPG with the blandest ♥♥♥♥ing story in gaming history. First off, this game basically plays itself. My party consists of 6 melee characters and I just send in the tank first into a fight and watch 6 characters beat the snot out of monsters while I hit a hotkey to make some people heal every now and again. It feels like an arcade game, where it's pretty god damn easy a lot of the time, but every now and again has a difficulty spike to ♥♥♥♥ you up.\n\nAside from the fact that I've won many fights without even pressing anything, and has almost 0 strategy, this game is fun as hell. If your fun comes from winning challenging fights through tactics and strategy, you won't like this game. If you like to just watch a bunch of guys beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of monsters for a minute, then grab loot, and repeat for an hour or so, you'll love this game. The best part about this game imo is that its a journey. You walk down a pretty linear path, with your party consisting of up to 8 people including pack mules, into different environments, killing ♥♥♥♥ in caves, and finally hitting a town after a few hours to unload all of those nifty lil items you got from the monsters you mugged. Then you do this bunch more times and you eventually win.\n\nHey, if you enjoyed watching your crew beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of monsters for like 10-15 (tbh i forgot how long this game is) hours, YOU CAN DO IT AGAIN. Theres a wonderful man who published a guide on how to get Legends of Aranna singleplayer expansion for the steam copy of Dungeon Siege in case yours didn't have it. This is basically more of the same, just going down a road beating the ♥♥♥♥ out of monsters with a new gang, but in different environments.\n\nHey, if you enjoyed the expansion pack or the main campaign, YOU CAN DO IT AGAIN. This game has a ♥♥♥♥in multiplayer mode with IP and LAN methods of connection, so you and I think 7 other people can go around a NEW world thats much more open than either of the singleplayer campaigns, and beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of monsters for a while. The multiplayer map is roughly 2x as big as the main campaign's map, and is much more open. I have beaten the multiplayer with someone and it was great. I haven't tried any, but there are mods that allow you to play the multiplayer campaign, solo, with a full squad of 8 characters.\n\nIts a pretty mindless journey of an ARPG, but if you want to just watch 1-8 people mug monsters for loot for a while, or do it with some buds, this game is great. Just remember this game does whatever the ♥♥♥♥ it wants in terms of it functioning.","December 23, 2015","true","12.0"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","14","15","2","0"

The experience of this game is probably more akin to the idea of a Lord of the Rings type quest than anything more computer-game/zone-based, because as I have mentioned before you really get the feeling that you are blazing your own path, one that only occasionally intersects with civilization. Echoing ice caverns full of crystal avatars fill you with apprehension as the prospect of questing for hours without seeing the light of day is very real and a gameplay element in itself, and once you escape a gruelling forest zone midway through the game you are confronted with a seemingly impassable swamp, rather than the stereotypical sunny metropolis populated with traders.\n\nDungeon Seige is also a difficult game - an example being the afore-mentioned swamp which pits your squad - albiet experienced and doughty - against hordes of difficult creatures marshalled by witches and targetting your most vulnerable members.\n\nThe difficulty of the game, and the sheer distances of travel involved, is counterbalanced by the joys of a steadily improving squad. You have the choice to ally yourself with various squad members - more than you can ever hold in your total squad, in a feature that reminds one of the Baldur's Gate series and adds to the sense of blazing one's own path - and you can't wait for your hitherto skinny and ragged heroes and squad members to stumble across great shields, shiny helmets or keen longswords. Improving your skills relies simply on using related items - keep using a one handed longsword and a mini experience bar built in to your 'melee item' combat slot will reflect your character's steady improvement in it's use, ditto for ranged, nature and fire spells.\n\nIn summary of this ragged and ill-formatted review (for which I beg your forgivness - I am partially distracted) I assure you that this game is a worthy investment of time and emotion - love your squad, covet your packmule, listen to every word of pre-recorded dialogue and seek out all encounters, because you are living through a bonafide high fantasy advanture, and it does, eventually, end.","March 28, 2014","true","35.0"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

Released back in 2002, I learned about this game through a cousin of mine, and I fell in love with the game. Spending well over 500 hours into its singleplayer and online multiplayer (now defunct -- LAN works great though), I never realized how much I would come to miss this game.\n\nA classic dungeon crawler where you're not limited by classes or levels. You can be whatever you want, a pure melee character, an archer, a mage, a combination of two, or all of the above. You have the ability to choose how you level up your skills. Instead of levels, there's strength, dexterity, and intelligence. These act as your levels towards what you want to use in combat, and progressively increase through combat. This is different from the timeless classic of Diablo 2, however has a great leveling system that's sure to let you play however you'd like. The storyline is wonderful, and with co-op multiplayer, it adds on more difficulty so your not running around finding too easy.\n\nUnfortunately, this doesn't come included with Dungeon Siege: Legends of Aranna, but if you happen to have a copy, you can install it over Steam's installation (plus with a little renaming of game executables) and be able to play it through Steam.\n\nOne of the downsides is that since its been over 11 years that Dungeon Siege has been released, multiplayer is now defunct. In Dungeon Siege, you'll find that the Multiplayer button gives you the message "Disabled". Is all hope lost? Of course not. By adding the launch parameter "zonematch=true" to your game, you can access multiplayer LAN and direct connection games without the use of warez, cracks, or patches. Its a shame that you need to bypass that message just for direct and LAN capabilities, but it gets the job done, and it still works perfectly.\n\nI would definitely recommend this game for anyone who's a fan of dungeon crawlers, especially playing them with friends, and for those who are looking to try something new. It's not hard to get the hang of, but it won't get too easy on you either.","July 15, 2013","true","4.1"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

What this means is that once you start the game you are in for the journey of a lifetime as this game has the whole map connected throughout. So if you want to walk back well its about 20 mins both ways through each town. Yes each place is checkmarked with a town so it is convenient yet a pain to walk back...just keep going. And fourth yes the COMBAT, the combat in dungeon siege game focuses on four classes melee fighter, archer, nature mage and combat mage. each has its own sets of advantages and weaknesses mostly the magic but its fun as hell to experiment with. (Imo the best class is the archer to an extent) That said dungeon siege is my alltime favorite h/s rpg of the century, it tops any other for 2002 if you can name one. One thing i cannot leave out is the graphics, because for 2002 these graphics are really well done for a dx8 game. The scenery the weather and the atmosphere are perfect for this game. So thats how i feel about dungeon siege a game that gives me nostalgia everytime i play it.\n\nHopefully you will get as much fun as i did out of it.  p.s. i still love this game to DATE.\n","May 28","true","6.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You can hire key NPCs into your party as you meet them. You share weapons and loot among 6 characters at a time.\n\n2) Similar to The Elder Scrolls, you gain skill ability by actually using skills, not as a pickable reward for gaining levels. Love this.\n\n3) Lots of side quests.\n\n4) Lots of hacky-slashy gameplay, and a breezy lightness to the whole thing.\n\nToday, you will need to look past the dated graphics, but this is a solid game.\n\nBe warned that Dungeon Siege requires a little effort to get running on a modern computer.

Ultimately, you end up with a party of six, and you choose how you want each person to develop their fighting style.\n\nOther D&D-style games like Baldur's Gate have a very steep learning curve, and are heavy on the player maintenance.

Then a great many years passed before I revisited the RPG, in fact, it wasn't until MMORPGs came about that I fell in love the with genre all over again.\n\nPlaying through Dungeon Siege I felt like the dots had been connected between the old school RPG and the modern MMO.  I bought 1, 2, and 3 in a combo pack, but I only played through the first.  I played through it entirely, and enjoyed the trip down memory lane.  I'm going to recommend it, it's a good a game and deserves a thumbs up, but you'll likely only enjoy it for the nostalgia if you're old like me, or as a history lesson if you're a youngster.

When I first played Dungeon Siege I was really taken by the simplicity of the skills mechanic and the fact that once you are in the world there are no loading screens - you just constantly walk through one giant map. There's not much story to the game, just some serious grindy RPG action with some side quests thrown in for the completionists like myself.\n\nOne thing I originally liked about the game was that there aren't any confusing skill trees, just specialisations and attributes in which you can level up simply by doing things - hitting things with a stick gives you melee skill and mostly strength, while casting spells gives you magic skill and mostly intelligence, etc. This is now the very thing I dislike about the game. While it's nice and simple it does kind of make combat slightly boring as you don't have an array of special abilities to manage (well, none unless you have a mage). Sure, mages have spells which they can switch between, but only being able to actively switch between two spells without some complicated process and having no autocasts just gets tiresome. I still really love this game, but I think if it weren't for the nostalgia I probably wouldn't be enjoying as much as I am today.\n\nIf you played Dungeon Siege on its initial release and enjoyed it back then, then it might be worthwhile getting for another play through, but if you're new to the series I would recommend skipping over this one and starting with Dungeon Siege II, which has much better gameplay. Now, back to the grindstone.","July 21, 2013","true","7.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The reviews I've read from my peers thus far are spot on. This little Tactical-RPG was way ahead of its time. Touted as a "Diablo killer", clearly inspired by Baldur's Gate the expectations were high (to say the least) upon release.\n\nAdmitedly though and to no surprise the fledgling developer (at the time) Gaspowered Games may have bitten off more than it could chew (as the title falls short in many aspects of its predecessors). Still this shouldn't deter you from giving it a go as it is a solid piece of work from start to finish.\n\nUnfortunately however Steam has failed to acquire the Exanpsions which contain necessary patching and multiplayer is relegated to LAN, TCP/IP, Hamachi or GameRanger. All of these options require time and effort to coordinate play with others rather than being able to just jump right in. Still if you like ARPGs give this one a chance.\n\nIt should also be noted there were many mods of varying qualities great and small including a couple of conversions such Ultima V & 6 all thanks to the dedicated Dungeon Siege Community -- should you be interested extending the experience.","June 15, 2014","true","7.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Dungeon Siege remains one of the most dynamic, engaging and complex games in its genre and it plays smoother than ever on Steam.  Do not hesitate on this.  The price is great, even when it isn't on sale, and stands high among modern Dungeon Crawlers like Torchlight 2 and Diablo III.  If you are a fan of the genre, this is a must-play.\n\nLeveling is smooth and effortless, requiring little maintanence, as skills and stats level through use.  You start as a blank slate, and as you use weapons and spells, your stats and your proficiency in those attack types increases automatically, similar to something like modern Elder Scrolls games.  It's a fluid and fun style.  Add to that the strategy element of having AI-controlled companions fighting alongside you, who can take commands or be set up in formations with proiorities and focuses that you choose based on their stats, with a number of optional playable units to hire from towns and dungeons.\n\nThis is a fast game, too.  It has all the challenge you would expect from an entry in the genre and encourages exploration and experimentation as you progress through the game.  Do not hesitate to invest in this title.  It is one of the greatest PC games of all time and remains one of my all-time favorite Dungeon Crawlers of all time!","June 29, 2014","true","4.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The reviews I've read from my peers thus far are spot on. This little Tactical-RPG was way ahead of its time. Touted as a "Diablo killer", clearly inspired by Baldur's Gate the expectations were high (to say the least) upon release.\n\nAdmitedly though and to no surprise the fledgling developer (at the time) Gaspowered Games may have bitten off more than it could chew (as the title falls short in many aspects of its predecessors). Still this shouldn't deter you from giving it a go as it is a solid piece of work from start to finish.\n\nUnfortunately however Steam has failed to acquire the Exanpsions which contain necessary patching and multiplayer is relegated to LAN, TCP/IP, Hamachi or GameRanger. All of these options require time and effort to coordinate play with others rather than being able to just jump right in. Still if you like ARPGs give this one a chance.\n\nIt should also be noted there were many mods of varying qualities great and small including a couple of conversions such Ultima V & 6 all thanks to the dedicated Dungeon Siege Community -- should you be interested extending the experience.","June 15, 2014","true","7.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As it is, as sold by Steam, I would not suggest purchasing the game. I played all the way through and what you're getting here is the bare minimum version of the game. It's bugged as it is, and while some glitches can be worked around with enough knowledge and personal tweaking, there are some things, like the missing ending video files after fighting the last boss that prevents you from obtaining his loot, and thelack of access to multiplayer that dampers just about the whole experience. It was fun while it lasted, but there's a better version of the game out there. Also, by default, no Legends of Aranna. Stick to the real deal. Again, I recommend this game and the first sequel, just not the way it's sold here, even if it is dirt cheap right now.

Bloated loot system with no town portal to sell said items, a difficulty step missing between normal and easy (easy is too easy and normal is punishing even at higher levels), scant story and an enviromnment that obscures almost every monster to come your way.  The game almost plays better being constantly on the map rather than the normal top down game mode, the party member's battle AI is atrocious, the pathing is specious at best.  Traps are either very deadly or inconsequential with no in-between.  The textures of everything blend into a hodge podge.  The battles do better than constant pausing (a la Baldur's Gate), which can be done at any time, but is really only suitable for corner cases.\n\nBasically, any advancement that had happened since this game was released casts a pall over the game which I think would have been much more revolutionary at the time than it is now.  It's old school and not in a fun, engaging way, but more of an, "I'm only hanging out watching my guys fight just in case I need to press the 'heal' or 'mana' keys" or "I said kill the freaking wizard/cleric that keeps ressurecting the monsters, you dolts!" kind of experience.","May 1, 2014","false","46.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It was made before the consolization frenzy, but it's not so old that the graphics make it hard to play.\n\nWhat I love about it is the lack of character classes. In that respect, it is as sandboxy as Elder Scrolls. You gain skill by doing things, which allows you to do them better and equip better equipment. This is the best possible way for an RPG to work and I don't understand why more developers don't do it this way.\n\nSpeaking of sandboxy, play multiplayer by yourself. Total sandbox with no quests. Very cool. I got lost in a mine for a week. It was awesome.\n\nI haven't played DS1 recently enough to comment on controls or sound, but I don't recall having issue with either of them.\n\nSo I give Dungeon Siege an A. It's my favorite of the franchise.","July 8, 2012","true",""," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

I play mostly out of nostalgia.\n\n6/10 (It's alright).\n\nAnd if you are running Windows 7, be prepared to troubleshoot because this game does have trouble running in the newer systems, not a performance issue, but just getting it to run.

That is literally all you do. It gets very tedious, very quick. Granted, the graphics are very nice for its time and I enjoy them very much. Much of the scenery is very inspired and you can tell they took the time to make it very detailed.\n\nThat being said, the maps are beyond huge. It's so easy to get lost and it can get very frustrating, quick. If all you want to do is hack n slash. This is definitely for you. The party concept of this game is awesome! You can have 7 people total in your party including a pack mule to carry all of your inventory which is very convenient. You have 3 main skills, Strength, Dexterity and Intelligent. (Swordsman, Bows and Spells).\n\nI played roughly 4-6 hours total and got to chapter 4 out of 9 chapters. I also killed and explored EVERY bit of area as I worked my way towards 5, but it's just..so tedious. Honestly, it's fun for what it is and I'm hoping to finish it one day, but no rush. Lastly, the story is fine. It's pretty interesting and the side quests are fun, even though they are just done along the way. The only problem is again, the maps are so insanely huge you might skip it and not even know. Problem with that? No fast travel and if you're a 100% kinda guy.

I haven't played the newer ones, but this one is simply amazing. While the multiplayer is disabled, the singleplayer works just fine.

Other than that, the choices of being a warrior, ranger or two types of mages, or just mixing it up a bit, because you don't need to specifically pick a class, the game provides hours of entertainment. Before you question it, yes there is a difficulty setting, from easy to hard.

It's huge shame.\n- compatibility issues (exceptions) with Windows version > 7\nBy luck, you can restore manually compatibility & multiplayer. See guide below.\n- no editor to create your own content\n\nTheorically you should'nt support Square Enix because they ruined all DS version on Steam compared to boxed version.\n\n\nIII) GUIDE to force compatibility & multiplayer :\n\n\n__guide beginning__\n\n1) Compatibility\n\n-- In DS directory --\n(should be something like Steam\Steamapps\common\dungeon siege 1\) :\n\n- force DungeonSiege.exe to be launched as "Windows XP SP2 compatibility"\n- run DSVideoConfig.exe, change video driver settings as "Primary Display Driver" avoiding any TnL option. Cancel shadows as well because they are often problems in-game with modern hardware.\n\n-- In your Steam library --\nright-click on game name and change settings :\n\n- uncheck Steam overlay\n\n2) Modern screen & multiplayer\n\n-- In your Steam library --\nright-click on game name and change settings in properties :\n\n- game launch option, add this command below\nzonematch=true width=1600 height=1200\nto force game to be displayed in modern config (replace 1600x1200 by your own screen config)\n\nzonematch=true allow only multiplayer, for solo just write zonematch=false\nPublic servers are gone, you can only play multiplayer in local.\n\nFor multiplayer, you must use Tunngle account to force computer to find your friends like they were playing on local with you, because all online multiplayer servers are gone.\n\n__ guide ending__\n\n\nIV) GUIDE to install Legend of Aranna\n\n\nEven if you can find such guide on Steam, i don't support it for many reasons :\n- it's 100% illegal to install software without license. Those who pretend some Steam version can be downloaded with Legend of Aranna included are pure liars. It's illegal content to update Steam version with cracked no-cd version. Square Enix don't own rights about DS1 & DS2 add-ons.\n- you must replace your exe files to anothers at your own risk\n- some guide's owners add you as friend, help you to solve all problems about DSLOA install but when it's end, come to beg you for free gift game. NEVER TRUST ANY GIFT. Unfriend these swindlers immediatly because real friend never ask to you something just to help you.\n\n\nV) EVALUATION :\n\nEven if this Steam version doesn't include Legend of Aranna, i must admit i take pleasure to play it because i'am real fan of this serie (i talk about DS1 & DS2, DS3 is only pure joke and won't be DS game).\n\n[Good]\n- easy real-time Hack'n'Slash without need of gear optimization to play it\n- 4 classes to play : Warrior (melee+shield), Archer (ranged), Mage (natural or war)\n- autoleveling stats depending on which weapons you use, on each up you gain major xp on your main stat depending on weapon your use and full regen HP/mana, on each fight round you receive short xp to increase stas & skills.\n- progressive difficulty\n- some hidden areas to discover\n\n[Bad]\n- no tp to city/merchants to sell junk, you must use spell to convert junk or play game as rogue-like getting only essential\n- no shared stash to share your items between characters (multiplayer)\n- no mobs respawm in solo game (you must play with limited XP & loots)\n- no world quest saved in multiplayer (when you quit game, you loose all current quest activated, but it seem possible to do quests each time you log in)\n- mage classes are pain to play due to lack of active spell slots\n- only normal difficulty mode\n- missing content & broken end-game.\n\n\nBuy it only when discounted price like -75% off or less.\n\n\nTo be continued (i'am currently testing Steam version fully, i'll update later my evaluation)...","April 8","true","140.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Dungeon Siege is to roleplaying/combat-adventure games as RoboCop is to, well... movies, basically. It took the world by storm, and sure, not many might acknowledge it these days, but it's still one of those permanent milestones which just smacked you raw with how great it was and still is, even compared to modern crap. Hell, even being threatened by two horribly shïtty excuses for sequels didn't ruin either of 'em. Hell naw!

The graphics are still good despite the game being old. but the game's controls and camera take a while of getting used to. There is a high amount of customization available if you know how to (might want to check out my guide) and the music is just amazing. It really makes the atmosphere greater from what it already is.\n\nThe game is actually challenging, especially if you choose the first 7 npcs that you come across in your party and don't replace them on higher difficulties. Your party just kind of feels weak and you really need to be careful because of that.\n\nThe multiplayer WAS what made the game truly great, however. It was easier to play and fights didn't take as long because of having a team. The multiplayer campaign takes about 20 hours to complete (need clarification, will be playing through it again). I would suggest playing the game with max of 3 characters OR playing it on multiplayer for the best experience.\n\nThere is one bug I've encountered so far on the steam version - after defeating gom, you are not shown any cutscene or given congratulations for beating the game (which i remember should happen), but instead you are returned to the main menu bugged, without showing cursor and being unable to exit game easily.\n\nI just finished playing through Ehb for the fifth time solo... It's a true gem. (}LORD{) clan ftw - 10/10, play this game!","June 29, 2014","true","35.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

If you have your network properly setup, you don't need to do anything but internet/host and give the other players your IP.  If not, there are tools like Hamachi, Tunngle, and GameRanger available.\n\nIf the game is not functioning correctly in Windows 8, 10, etc, standard troubleshooting applies, but it definitely works in those OSes without any special tools.\n\nThe optional bonus pack includes:\n-lots of art/manuals/etc\n-DS1 Tool Kit\n-Siege Editor\n-DS Stat Calculator\n-These Mods (Yoodiv has not used most):\nCircle of Lorent (recommended by Yoodiv)\nAllysium\nArcher Mod\nAtomic FX\nBounty Hunter\nDeath Spirit\nDSRevived\n"Download through your browser" here:\nhttps://mega.nz/#!64FhlLIY!FlUKtfIXTR78W6BoE4k56s0pShhX-4Am3oB9M1KILj8\n\nI have a similar review/guide for DS2 with expansion in multiplayer here:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Yoodiv/recommended/39200","March 6","false","100.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

The dungeons feel overly long, as if they extended gameplay through the sheer length they make your characters walk.  The combat is pretty bland.  I went almost all archers with my squad since, at the hardest difficulty, 1: Melee gets decimated and 2: It costs no resources unlike spells.  It does fairly well but the gameplay is just blah.\n\n99% of the item drops fall into 2 categories:  Items you can't wear and Items you can't use.  Either all of the drops have stat requirements that are way beyond what my characters can use or they aren't even close to being an upgrade.  It's almost exclusively vendor trash.\n\nLeveling:  It's pretty much a use a skill get some auto xp gains system.  There is no decision making other than what to use.  I chose to focus on a single discipline rather than jack-of-all-trades.  That said, since I am ranged, my armor selection is pretty ♥♥♥ since it's based on str and int for useage requirements.  The choices are poor even if I DID have the appropriate attributes to wear said equipment.\n\nQuests:  I'm sorry, there are quests?  Basically it's talk to the 3 npcs you'll encounter per chapter then walk linearly through a massive dungeon crawl, completing the quests.  Hardly what I'd call quests.  There's not really even a reward for doing them that I can see.\n\nIt comes down to this: I am playing this through JUST to beat it and play it, but it's not very fun.  I was hoping for a NWN-type game and it comes off as an overly long poor diablo clone with a bigger party and crappier combat.  My playthrough on the hardest difficulty is basically, set my party to hold/engage freely/strongest target, have them all ranged, then pull with a single guy into range and have the mobs explode.  I move the party about 3 feet then repeat.  Ranged is kind of necessary since even melee die in 3-4 hits and you can get swarmed by 5+ if you aren't careful.  It's a slow slog through dungeons that seem to never end.  Since I bought Dungeon Siege 1, 2, and 3 I am hoping the sequels will be much better.\n\nDo I regret buying this?

Besides that, the plot AND locations are pretty much identical to Dungeon Siege 3 but the graphics, controls, and AI are much better there.  So get Dungeon Siege 3 instead; you'll be happier with that one.\n\nThat said, if you really are looking for an outdated party-based dungeon-crawling RPG then this one isn't really a bad choice.  You start out ALONE but you can later recruit other warriors (all AI controlled) and/or donkeys that don't fight but have much more inventory space to carry stuff.  You can have up to 7 or 8 (I forget) people and mules in your group at any time; they all fight on screen together.  There are more recruitable characters than there are spots on your team, too.  A mule and a person take up the same space on your team, so you can either have 2 mules and 6 people, or 1 mule and  people, or 8 people without any mules.  You can only actively control one player at a time but you can switch your choice to another character (even one of the mules) at any time.  You can also give one or several of your party members individual commands, such as telling three people to attack a strong enemy and then telling the other five to stay back and let the mage heal them for a minute.\n\nEach character can develop various skills, and it's ENTIRELY up to you which ones to develop.  Warriors can use swords, maces, axes, etc. to smash foes and they use a lot of the strength stat.  Combat mages can hurl fireballs and summon creatures to kill stuff.  Nature mages can heal the party AND they have a few solid attack spells.  At least one nature mage (preferably two) is a MUST.  Both mage types run off of the intelligence stat.  Archers use bows to rain destruction from a distance and they use the dexterity stat.  Honestly though, bows are pretty crappy until you're almost 2/3 done with the game.  Only characters with high dexterity can use a decent bow.  Only characters with high strength can equip decent armor and smash/slash weapons.  Intelligence increases the effectiveness of magic spells; mage skill levels only determine which spells you are allowed to use.\n\nThere are no "skill points" to allocate.  It's all automatic.  You set the type of attack the character will use, and they use that one attack type until you tell them to switch to a different one.  CAUTION:  magic attacks use up magic power (the blue bar) and if you leave mages set to spell attacks they will stand there and do NOTHING until their MP recharges.  So you might have to manually change your mages to archers or warriors when their MP runs low.  Whichever type of attack they use, that's the one that will earn "experience" and slowly build up to the next level.","May 14, 2015","false","23.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Seriously, before people gave me "I am too young" or "This game was good for its time", I actually played good action rpg's like darkstone, nox, and the original diablo and enjoyed them. Dungeon Siege should be forgotten, as it has two major flaws with the game.\nThe Bad:\n1. Easy: The game is too due to having regen health, 40 million health potions throwned at you, and the foes you faced being too damn weak.\n2. Boring: The game throws several dozens opponents at you on a small map. So every few steps, some might pop out, and you ever kill them or run to attract more of them. But the biggest sin is combat, as melee fighters just auto attack, which leads the game to be walk spot here, sit there as your guys hacks every 200 people on screen.\nThe Good:\n1. Presentation: The game has good music (because of Jeremy Soule being the composer), very good gwaphix (for its time, really out of date now), and the game is not buggy.\nConclusion: Just shock how this piece of ♥♥♥♥ game is beloved by many people, and how this game made a franchise.

I can only recommend it to die hard fans of hhaack & slash .\n\nWhere to start?\n\nFirst of all the textures are watered down and are not pleasent to watch at all. I found myself using the overhead map just to avoid looking at those low res textures all the time.\nYes it does add that oh so fascinating idea of progressing your character by using either a weapon or a spell. The idea is very interesting at start but when you actually get to play the game over a few hours you realize that only melee chars are viable in this game. Magic and ranged are practically useless or at least utterly inferior to melee chars.\n\nThe first few maps have a really slow progression curve,which is both satisfying at first but gets absolutelly frustrating way too fast. You get too many pointless drops and too little gold to actually progres the first quarter of the game and right after the game literally starts throwing thousands of gold at you and the sense of progression is really out of the question.\n\nAll monster drops dont really mean anything because you get tons of gold to buy all the best gear from the next shop. And by gear i mean just get the weapon with most damage for your melee chars and you are good to go. All the other items are absolutely pointless.\n\nOh and speaking of chars,its all fun  when you have one char,and get 2-3 more..but soon enough you get a total of 8, leaving inventory management a burden. Everything you pickup is esentially worthless anyway. You only need the weapon with most damage in the next shop for each of your chars and to fill your inventory with health potions.\nYes only health potions ,because the mana potions are redundent since most of the wortwhile spells in the game cost your entire mana pool in 2-3 casts. There are several spell options but all of them are completely pointless as most of them try out a tactical point of view to a game that literally throws hundreds of mobs at you for no particular purpose.\n\nThere is no feeling of progress nor of getting the next best item.\n\nThe story is almost non-existent,battle the generic utter evil that plagues the land.\n\nThe environments are very detailed though and vary a lot,unfortunatelly both the environments and the enemies fall in the generic hack & slash creatures and zones and neither stand out.\n\nThe music is probably the best part of this game.The main theme is one of the most memorable music display in my game experience, which is both a good and a bad thing. Why a bad thing? Because there is only one god damn piece of music that  gets recycled all over the game.It is sad to see a game stand out only through its music.\nSpeaking of sound, the sound effects just do their job but they are utterly forgetable and lackluster as well. The voiceovers ? They almost dont exist at all which is not helping with the immersion at all.\n\nThe story is poor to say the least,itt is another generic farmer that starts out to help a friend and ends up saving the kingdom, so unique .\n\nGetting back to gameplay. The progressing system is pretty cool as an idea as it does not limit you to a specific class.\nThe stats progression is insanely slow and limits the item usability tremendously. A huge amount of mage/ranger items require a high amount of strength for example,which esentially limits their use.\n\nAll this can be overlooked if it werent for the almost complete automatization of the game. You just need to run in and click in the middle of a group of mobs and the game will take care of the rest. You just need to have a potion handy from time to time,which does not make it challenging at all.\n\nThe game is overall all too tedious and it throws too many enemies at once making certain areas feel like they need an eternity to finish off\n\nConclusion? Dungeon Siege is awfully slow paced,non immersive and tedious to a point where you just stop caring about the quests,story and gameplay overall.

OH but how dissapointed i was, this collection is NOT complete, where is DS 1 and 2's xpansions? Why is the multiplayer disabled *NO MORE CHICKEN LEVEL FTW!!!!*\nI do recommened it, works absolutly fine on Win8.1, the crashes it has, has always been there *it was even incompatible with Win XP FFS, lol* so that never has bothered me *SAVE SAVE SAVE PEOPLE*\n\nBut this is a very very butchered version of it, i am deeply dissapointed, and i had no idea Square Enix took them over, which is proberly why the Xpansions are gone and mulitiplayer too...

I somehow actually stilll have the intact box and CDs sitting around in storage somewhere.\n\nYou control up to eight characters at once, including a pack mule to act as extra inventory space. Characters can be specialized in a few ways, with two different schools of magic, ranged, or melee attacks. If you are feeling saucy, you can combine and make a hybrid class, such as a spellsword or some kind of other variant. You can succeed with nearly any party combination, so there isn't much pressure to min/mix the perfect party combination.\n\nCombat is very micro-heavy, with lots of little subtle things needed to keep your party fighting in top shape. Although the game starts slow, you'll very quickly end up with a party of four to six characters and you'll be slashing through huge parties of monsters. You'll need to pay attention to what spells are being cast, positioning of your characters, and more; it's very consuming and very satisfying when you get through an encounter unscathed.\n\nWith a modern eye, though, there are a lot of rough parts to the game. Camera control is a pain, and controlling your party can get really overwhelming when you have a ton of characters. With casters, it can be clunky to switch between spells in combat. I really enjoyed this game and I still enjoy it to this day, but it might be hard to get for someone who didn't play it back in the day.","February 9, 2015","true","38.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I started playing this title when it was first released, and I still find myself coming back to it after over a decade.\n\nThe control and combat system is pretty intuitive, and camera only bites you when you have your back to a steep wall (extreme zoom).  That isn't much of a problem, however, since you can turn the camera around with ease.  The party manipulation options are somewhat in-depth, with multiple selections for formations, movement ranges, and aggression.  Probably more than what's needed to play through the game, but workable nonetheless.\n\nAnother great feature is the loading screens (or lack therof).  You load once at the beginning, and the game "streams" the entire world without a pause; the entire map from start to finish.  The maps are not huge by any means, but big enough that this is an impressive feature given when this game was released.\n\nCharacter development is also interesting; your party members develop thier combat effectiveness by how you use them (melee, ranged, caster, etc.).  You can also switch fighting styles at any time, just be mindful that a jack-of-all is a master-of-none (unless you grind all your skills on the multiplayer map).\n\nThe single-player campaign has just enough content to keep you focused on why you're stomping your way through hordes of hostile creatures, and doesn't overload you with too much "lore."  The multi-player offers an additional map that you can use, and both the single and multi maps can be used for it.\n\nThere is also a massive mod community for this game, which also keep it alive for those who own computers that have left this old title in the dust.\n\nLike I said, it is downright fun (and cheap, too).","March 17, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They were published back when games required skill and thought to complete rather than a clickfest on rails to the finish line. The game's story is thin compared to modern games, but it is fairly compelling. Although the game does have a linear playthrough it is still a great player experience.\n\nThe biggest letdown here is the steam version. Naturally, they disabled multiplayer and vast numbers of purchasers are unable to use the expansion pack. These issues can both be resolved by digging around for the guide online. I highly recommend picking this up and playing through it before you play DS2 though as the improvements in DS2 will leave you a wanting a bit more from this.","March 1, 2015","true","30.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I somehow actually stilll have the intact box and CDs sitting around in storage somewhere.\n\nYou control up to eight characters at once, including a pack mule to act as extra inventory space. Characters can be specialized in a few ways, with two different schools of magic, ranged, or melee attacks. If you are feeling saucy, you can combine and make a hybrid class, such as a spellsword or some kind of other variant. You can succeed with nearly any party combination, so there isn't much pressure to min/mix the perfect party combination.\n\nCombat is very micro-heavy, with lots of little subtle things needed to keep your party fighting in top shape. Although the game starts slow, you'll very quickly end up with a party of four to six characters and you'll be slashing through huge parties of monsters. You'll need to pay attention to what spells are being cast, positioning of your characters, and more; it's very consuming and very satisfying when you get through an encounter unscathed.\n\nWith a modern eye, though, there are a lot of rough parts to the game. Camera control is a pain, and controlling your party can get really overwhelming when you have a ton of characters. With casters, it can be clunky to switch between spells in combat. I really enjoyed this game and I still enjoy it to this day, but it might be hard to get for someone who didn't play it back in the day.","February 9, 2015","true","38.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a contemporary of the original Neverwinter Nights, and while that was more for the cerebral D&D style RPG gamer, Dungeon Seige married hack and slash with RPG in a new way.   Rather than be like Diablo, it went the direction of being linear, giving a bit of an epic-tale sort of feel.\n\nUnfortunately, I can't recommend it for purchase and use on newer machines.  It's not natively Win7+ compatible, which is normally not really a problem, but its older code for graphics management bleeds over to cause some pretty nasty glitching in HUD graphics and gameplay stuttering on nicer machines.   I'll need to run it in a virtual machine, which is beyond where most gamers are willing to take something they pick up on sale.   It may also run a bit better on ARM processors or similar systems that do not have discrete video cards.\n\nAs a game, 8 of 10.

I have to say it was a great journey back in time to a more classic feeling game with a wide array of settings.  The challenge was fairly good and would have been more challenging if I had played on hard mode.  I loved how a lot of the battles consisted of a large number of enemies and that you could have a large group of party members.  Some of the dungeons are very long (Sometimes I felt like I was playing a solo World of Warcraft classic style dungeon because of the roles of the party members, large battles and the length of dungeons.).  It was also nice to see that the items you could buy in the store were actually useful and that you would want to buy them.  There are so many ways to play this game that my playstyle of trying to be everything was hindered.  That isn't really a bad thing.  You could play this multiple times, being different types of characters, though I'm not really one to play through a game again.  I like to move on and try something new.\n\nThe music (in the majority, is very nice) reminded me a lot of The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind.  Some are repetative though (very short and then it repeats), making those annoying.  I didn't realize that it was the same composer until today.  Early on, some of the voices were annoying, but a lot were interesting and sometimes funny.  Hearing the click of selecting or opening a persons inventory became annoying, fast (and you did this a lot).\n\nAt the beginning of the game, the amount of inventory space is annoying (not enough).  It was a long way to the first town.  Also, with very large areas between two shop areas, you will find your inventory full and have to travel back long distances to sell things.  One other thing deals with organization of inventory.  I would group my health and mana potions together, seperately.  When I would use them, it wouldn't use them in order from top to bottom.  So, I ended up with a scattered mess that I would end up having to organize again.  In a shop with spells to purchase, it would have also been nice to sort and seperate the two types of magic (nature and combat).  It would have also been nice to be able to grab multiple items in your inventory to move around.\n\nWhen I would have multiple characters's windows open or just a shop along with one character, the inventory windows for the group would appear extra small (with shop window open this actually only occurred with the pack mules).  It made it harder to do what I wanted.\n\nIt took me to long to figure out how to clearly get everyone to play their roles in battle (some wouldn't move or attack, even though I had set things to do so).  I eventually figured out I needed to select a character and then hit ctrl-A to select everyone or press ctrl and click on the members you wanted, to get things to work properly.  This was after figuring out what the different battle options did and setting them for each of the party members.  It is also to easy to click on other characters, which then deselects everyone else.\n\nIf you want to take any screenshots and not have the adventurer's handbook open, you will need to go into the input options and change your hotkey for the handbook.  The default screenshot button is F12, which is also the adventurer's handbook.\n\nSometimes it is hard to get all your party on a transport elevator before it moves.  Then you have to wait to get everyone together.\n\nIt would have been nice if they had labeled the area you were currently in on the map and when you are entering a new area.\n\nI had a few crash to desktop occurrances and exceptions while playing through the game.  The last crash I had was a memory error where the game apparently didn't deallocate correctly.  This was in Castle Ehb.\n\nI disliked the dropping of a party members complete inventory onto the ground when it dies.  It creates a mess of text on the screen (you could turn the text off), as well as having to keep up with who was carrying what.  I also hit max gold and then when I would sell things, it would drop the gold on the ground.  This eventually created a pile of text.  I'm not sure if it was play style, to much stuff for the amount of gold one can carry or that to much gold can be found in chests or dropped from an enemy.  I also came back to the dropped pile of gold one time, after many, and found it gone.\n\nThe pack mules don't follow behind my party in a speedy fashion during battles, which can sometimes cause problems of them getting out of the way from being hit by an enemy.\n\nAs far as the ending goes, I had to watch it on YouTube.  I find this a very bad thing.  When you defeat the final boss and it explodes, it drops loot and then the screen goes black.  You are then returned to the start menu.  In the non-steam version, you are sent to a black screen with text and narration to end the story.  Then, you get the credits.  After this, you are returned to the game to be able to pick up the loot and do as you please (play multiplayer or expansions).  I guess since the steam version doesn't come with multiplayer and the expansions, they cut this out.  It still should have gone through the ending credits and then returned you to the game to pick up the loot.\n\nThough it seems I mentioned more of the negative aspects to this game, it is a very good game overall.  It is definately worthy of being played.  Hopefully steam will release a fix for the ending and sparse crashes.\n\nRating\n9/10","March 10, 2015","true","84.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The camera viewpoint, the movement of your characters, the designated attacks are all based on point and click, mouse selections.\n\nAs for the RPG elements of the game, it's up there with "Diablo", "War Craft", and the "Dungeons and Dragons" entries to the genre. There are elements on par with "Morrowwind" and "Skyrim", although as may already be obvious, this is not a First Person Shooter! It is all 3rd person, bird's eye view from beside or above your character and their companions. It is Real Time, which is significant too. But with an adequate save facility, and pausing as needed, this is not difficult to manage, even for those who may prefer Turn-Based games.\n\nAlso there is an extensive weapon, spell, armor, skill upgrade system which is built-in, almost automatic. Whichever weapons or spells you use the most, you get better and better at. It is broken down into the general categories of; Melee, Ranged, Nature Magic and Combat Magic. With lots of ways to cross train and improve abilities outside of your initial choices.\n\nPlus there's lots of loot and ways to improve your gear as you go along. not to mention lots of great monsters and villians to master. But one thing console players may be looking for is not so fully represented here are the boss battles. You have to beat increasingly difficult and powerful creatures and opponents. But these usually do not culminate in a boss battle. There are several really tough bosses, don't get me wrong. But this is not a level by level occurence. They are only sparingly sprinkled here and there, not through-out as some console, button pusher games have!\n\nAnd that's another thing I like about the first version. You don't have to sit there and continue to push the attack button, push the attack button, push the attack button, push the attack button, push the attack button, push the attack button! It's a lot like Diablo in that you set your hero on a creature and they will continue to fight it until it is killed, they are killed or you redirect their attention to a different foe or beast. Oh, there's plenty of action! But you don't have to train like you're going on a marathon, to progress fairly decently! Like I said, it's not so much button clicking! There! You like that or not!\n\nSome folks may not be attracted to this sort of gameplay. I understand that DS III may be more compatible for consoles, and more gamepad driven. It's okay. I got my game right here! "Dungeon Siege I" and "Dungeon Siege I, Legends of Aranna" are the best in my book. In fact, it's my favorite dungeon crawler, PC mouse driven, fantasy Role Play game! I rate it = 10 out of 10! Thanks for reading, I hope this helps some folks decide to try this version out!   PEACE!  Awwa - \A/","March 17, 2015","true","58.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Keeping the multiple party members together can get a bit tricky at times especially in areas with lifts or moving platforms, but is something the player will get used to micro-managing.\n\nGreat to be able to play this timeless classic on the latest hardware so many years after initial release.\n\nSpent 20 hours lost in Glitterdelve Mine.

Dungeon Siege 1 is old.  It came out in 2002, and the graphics are reflective of its age.  The gameplay itself is amazing however, it's a great RPG from days long past, and the ability to have up to eight party members was actually a breath of fresh air.  There are some definite balance issues, especially with how effective mass melee is.  Still, it provided a great atmosphere and RPG experience, with fun leveling mechanics.  The ability to change characters are you go is actually fun, although it felt like specialization was almost always superior.  The loot system had a few flaws, but overall was great.\n\nIt begins rather slow, and the first level farm + forest levels felt rather tedious.  After you begin to immerse yourself, the experience takens on a better form.  It feels almost liek Baldur's Gate, with a bit less character and world building.  For it's time, I think it was an incredible game, and I wish I would have played it back then, I think I would have found it amazing.  Despite that, I think if you are a fan of RPGs, this is a fun Action RTS with minor questing.  Some of the quests are more difficult, but in general it's focused entirely on the action and the character building.  While some later battles do require micromanagement, the game itself it's very long or difficult.\n\nI played on medium difficulty and finished the game in 14 hours, while taking a leisurely pace.  Recommended for fans of RPGs, especially older ones.  Aside from that, DS1 probably  won't be your cup of tea.\n","December 16, 2015","true","14.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Requires a few workarounds to work at its best on modern PCs but it is certainly a great game. If you like your typical DnD-style RPG games, well Dungeon Siege is in the same style but much more combat focused. You can have 8 dudes at once in a giant melee moshpit, and still find it difficult at a normal difficulty. The minigun doesn't do as much damage as I'd like.\n\nOn a scale of ham to vegetable, I'd say it's about pretzel.","December 6, 2015","true","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you want a big long journey with chaotic cluster♥♥♥♥ combat and tonnes of juicy loot then you're going to want to play Dungeon Siege.\nBe prepared to do a little bit of work if you want to get this gem running. Will link to guides at the bottom.\n\nThe combat is glorious once you have some people in your party (you can have up to 8) and doesn't begin to get old and manages to keep a consistant level of challenge going throughout the entire game.\nGraphically it's obviously dated but looks incredible for a game from 2002 and hasn't aged too poorly in my own opinion.\nThe sound design is incredible. The music (by Jeremy Soule, who also worked on the Elder Scrolls series, World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria, Neverwinter Nights and Baldur's Gate) and ambient sounds create an incredible atmosphere when exploring and travelling that is hard to match in any other game, though when you enter combat the music stays the same, which feels a tad out of place when you're in a cacophanous brawl of 25 people.\n\n\nSo the game is great, you'll agree once you play it but that is where issues lie - the game does not work well on modern machines without some tweeking. I managed to get it running with only a few insignificant glitches on Windows 7 by following this guide. Try it out, i worked for me and it will hopefully work for you too!\nAlso, here's a guide to get the expansion pack, Dungeon Siege: Legends of Aranna, a highly recommended addition that adds hours of new gameplay in a new campaign, tonnes of little convenient things like automated potion sharing and showing DPS on weapons, as well as increasing the level of loot variation by insane ammounts.

Also consider the "Cat Mansion Plus Pack" mod if you like low-poly anime style girls in skimpy clothing along with a few other tweaks like toilet plungers for weapons.  :P  There are definitely a few other decent mods for the game, but they are getting harder to find since many of the old mod sites are getting dilapidated.  :(\n\nYou can run the game just fine in 1080p.  To do so, set this under "Set Launch Options...":\nnointro=true fullscreen=true width=1920 height=1080 bpp=32 nospacecheck=true bltonly=true\n\nYour party can have up to 8 concurrent characters, including the starting hero character.  Other than pack mules, there are 16 recruitable characters available, and the ones with the highest stats are obtained later in the game.  In order of encounter, they are: Ulora, Gyorn, Rusk, Naidi, Zed, Gloern, Kroduk, Lorun, Merik, Phaedriel, Andiemus, Borkyev, Rhut, Sikra, Ulfgrim, Lord Bolinghar.\n\nThere is a finite amount of enemies in this game, sort of, but there is at least one place to farm respawning enemies if you want an insane amount of cash and XP: In chapter 4, you will travel through a swamp.  In the swamp, there are certain witch-like enemies that summon swamp monster type minions over and over.  Avoid killing the witch-like enemies and kill only the swamp monster enemies they spawn.  You can do this easiest if you avoid wearing damage reflecting gear, avoid AOE spells and effects, and are extremely careful with certain ranged skills.  If you do all melee, it is very easy. - although I cannot say for sure if this is all just a 'feature' of the 'Cat Mansion Plus Pack' I used.","June 13, 2015","true","130.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I played probably 1000 hours+ as a child. It has a great lore, gameplay, mechanics, beautiful world design, was moddable, etc., and was ahead of it's time when released. The graphics aren't super great, but it came out in 2000, so you really can't blame the developers. And the score is one of a kind, music like no other <3 I would reccomend this game to anyone.\n\nHOWEVER.\n\nThe steam release of this game is downright unacceptable. The game does not run on newer computers without fiddling of the game files after dowload, nothing hard in any way, but one should simply be able to jump right in. A game so grand deserves at least that much. And even when you do that, the game is still very hard to play. The screen flashes, parts of the HUD are not where they should be, and mouse clicks to not register in the correct location. These problems are due to the game being out of date and a simple update would make this game enjoyable once more.\n\nAnother thing I dislike is the fact that the multiplayer campaign is inaccessable in the steam release. There is a whole other fully fleshed-out world and a more in-depth character creation system that can only be accesseed via the multi-player tab.\n\nIf it weren't for these two issues, I'd say it's more than worth it's price.\n\nI'd like to request a developer make a modern remake/remastering of this game, make something along the same lines (because DS2 and DS3 are far too different and simplified in a way that makes them not enjoyable) or if someone could suggest a similar game to this that actually works, I'd be very appreciative.","August 24, 2015","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My only advice after that is to play it when you have alot of free time, its best to play through in the span of a short period of time. Also after you beat the main game you can enable the expansion using mods, and using even more mods you can play the multiplayer in singleplayer. If theres some things I dont like about the game its that caves and dungeons go on for longer than I like and they are really close togeather, ontop of that 2/3rd of the way through each dungeon/cave I keep thinking "Man, will this ever end".

Or BW for DS 1/2? The only reason I brought the complete pack was because it was supposed to be "complete" in my opinion you're better off buying it from some where that actually includes the ENTIRE game, even more so for the fact that LoA is basically needed to complete the DS 1 story =/\n\nSo I would suggest this game to anyone who loves old RPG's or just RPG's in general, this is a fantastic game along with DS 2 but I personally wouldn't buy it off steam as you don't actually get either expansion for DS 1 or 2, so go to GoG or somewhere similar that sells this + expansion and buy it from there!\n\nEDIT: The only way to 'activate' the expansions is to follow this guide https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=384309700 all credit goes to Killah as he's the one that figured it out, I'm still leaving my review as negative but that's a negative on valves part as they should include the expansions, the games are fan-♥♥♥♥ing-tastic!","March 6","false","16.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Too many incompatability issues...

I feel somewhat ripped off.\n\nFirstly; Why take multiplayer OUT of a game?

If you've got some brandnew Nvidia/AMD graphics then .. look in the forums before you buy it.\n\nIt mostly works quite well, but the AI controlling your party gets really confused sometimes if there are too many groups of enemies and then it gets quite frustrating to play, when your party spreads out and most certainly die.\n\nAvoid death at all costs, because even though resurrection is quite easy (if you stand close enough and you are not in combat at the same time), your character drops all items on the ground on death, that totally clutter the screen and each item needs to be picked individually.. Sheesh.\n\nThere is no honour in healing. Since there is no exp gain from healing, setting up a companion to be a healer would render it totally useless in time, because it will never gain levels.\n\nYou can have six members in your party AND two Pack-mules(!!).. Awesome. Unfortunately the mules can die too, leaving an even bigger mess to clean up, but its quite rare that they do.\n\nSave often.\n\nIt's easy to understand why this game spun a sequel and after playing the second installment I understand why it stopped. The third game, which is the first I played, is something completely different.","July 18, 2015","true","90.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
