You play as Ted, the air raid siren has just sounded and you have 60 seconds to grab supplies and family members and get down to your fallout shelter before the bombs hit.

But don’t worry, you’ve prepared, unlike most of the other saps who are about to take a crash course in nuclear fission you had the foresight to install a nuclear bunker under your house!\nYou smile smugly to yourself, all that time playing fallout was well spent after all and in a few seconds you’ll be sitting safely in your cosy vault as the world above you turns into a radioactive wasteland.\n\n\nTick Tock\n\nMoving for the shelter your eyes again drift to the crate of bottled water and an awful realisation washes all traces of smugness away.\nYou might have had the foresight to build a fallout shelter, but you never did get around to filling it with supplies did you?\nCursing your laziness you look desperately around the room, what items are you going to need in your shelter?\nFood, Water, maybe the wife and kids to keep you company?\nThe alarms are still wailing outside, how much warning do they give you?\n60 seconds?\nDashing towards the bottled water you trip over a can of soup, stumble and crash into a chair, if only your house wasn’t in such a mess!\nWhich room are the kids in anyway?\n... tick... tock...\n\n\nPre-Apocalypse\n\nThis is the premise behind the first part “60 Seconds” a unique little survival title developed by Robot Gentleman Studios.\nI say the first part, because “60 Seconds” is split into two very distinct yet connected games.\nThe first part of the game is a quick and frantic “treasure hunt” around your house.\nYou’ll control your character as he runs and stumbles through the various rooms searching for supplies to take down into the bunker.\nYou’re given a few short seconds to explore your surroundings before the sirens blare and the countdown begins, this time is vital to quickly scan around the layout of your house and look for the locations of useful items. (This changes every time you play!)\n\n\nSupermarket Sweep\n\nBefore you’ve had chance to complete your stock take the countdown will begin, it’s time to start grabbing those supplies and dropping them down the hatch into your vault.\nIt’s not as simple as grabbing everything in one go either, you can only carry so much at a time,  this leads to a frantic dash through the various rooms with armfuls of tinned food or bottled water.\nThis is 60 seconds of sandbox physics mayhem.\n\nFurniture will go flying, objects will get in your way and you’ll be looking for one thing and get distracted by something else.\nA radio might be useful to keep in touch with the outside world, maybe a good book would help stave off the boredom, there must be a first aid kit somewhere, etc.\nThese are the thoughts that will go through your head as you crash passed tables and fall over chairs in the rush.\nIt’s an ultra intense supermarket sweep and it’s as fun as it is frustrating!\n\n\nTake Shelter\n\nThis is just the beginning, after diving into the bunker yourself, you’ll get to experience vault life and ration out those precious supplies to prolong your existence (and that of your family if you got around to saving them) for as long as possible.\n\nOf course, if you got distracted by something shiny and didn’t make it into the shelter in time then you’ll be dead and need to start a new game, so let’s assume you did make it, because it’s in the shelter that the real fun starts.\n\n\nPost-Apocalypse\n\nThe game changes pace in the shelter and becomes a short tongue in cheek survival adventure.\nYou’ll spend the remainder of the game looking at a static screen of yourself and any rescued family members sitting in the vault along with whatever supplies you managed to scavenge.\n\nEach day this screen will be updated to reflect any changes in your little vault, including the ever dwindling supplies sitting on the shelf behind you.\nYour food and water will almost certainly require rationing if you’re to last until help arrives, keep someone hungry or thirsty for too long though and they’ll get sick and die.\n\nOther items you threw into the shelter could well prove useful too, you see, strange things happen when you’re cooped up in a vault.\nA board game might be enough to stave off madness and a can of bug spray might be handy if you don’t want to share your bunker with some new scuttling friends.\n\n\nDear Diary\n\nLike a post apocalyptic Adrian Mole, you keep a diary in the vault, but there’s more to write about than the dwindling water supplies.\nVault life is more eventful than you might think, random events happen every day and it’s these events that drive the narrative forward.\nEach day you will go through food and water rationing, deciding who (if anyone) gets something to eat or drink that day.You’ll then read through the vault diary,\nit’ll cover the health and moods of your surviving family members and report on any interesting events that occurred that day.\n\n\nKevin Costner or Mad Max?\n\nMutants, bandits, a nice game of scrabble, anything could happen as you wait out the apocalypse and most of these events will require you to make a decision which will impact the narrative as the days progress.\n\nThere’s a banging on the vault door, It could be a post apocalyptic mailman delivering some goodies, or it could just as likely be a gang of bandits fresh from the set of Mad Max, do you answer it? Well that’s up to you.\n\n\nValued in the Vault\n\nThe outcome of many of these events will depend on the salvaged items from the first part of the game.\nIf a radioactive bug bites a family member, you’d better hope you bought a first aid kit with you or the consequences might prove surprising.\n\nYour first play through will give you an idea of the importance of the various items you ignored whilst foraging for cans of soup to bring down into the vault.\nThis game will quickly teach you that no matter how innocuous an item seems, it could well prove useful in the vault.\n\n\nKeep Taking the Tablets\n\n60 Seconds is a refreshing and quirky little game but It definitely feels like a tablet conversion.\nIt’s quick to play and immediately addictive which is great, unfortunately, like most mobile gaming ports, it can feel a little shallow and become repetitive pretty quickly.\nHaving said that, it’s priced to reflect this short term appeal and there is no denying the hours of entertainment you’ll get out of playing it.\n\n60 seconds isn’t looking for a relationship, it’s looking for a fling.\nIts fun whilst it lasts, you’re going to enjoy it but you probably won’t remember it in the morning.\nIt’s the one night stand of post apocalyptic gaming!\n\n\nIf you enjoyed this review you can find the full version and many others HERE[www.review-well.com]\n","June 27, 2015","true","0.9"," 230 of 277 people (83%) found this review helpful 67 people found this review funny","83","230","277","67","0"

With only rare exceptions, it is a foregone conclusion how to assign rations, it usually doesn't feel like you are actually making a decision that you might have done differently to result in a different outcome.  So most of what you are doing in this game is a kind of mindless make-work to see the next random result.\n\nYou might have a person who is sick or wounded -- but usually you will not have a medikit available to do anything about it, and if you do you will almost certainly use it right away.  Again, it's almost as if there is no true decision to be made that will change the result.\n\nPerhaps once a week you might send the healthiest out to explore and find supplies.  You only choose who to send, not where they go or what they focus on finding.  It's random where they go and what they bring back.  If you need a medikit or radio you can't focus on finding one, you just have to hope you get the random event result that makes it happen.  This can be frustrating when you have someone dying of starvation or disease as your explorer comes back with a discovered flashlight.\n\nAlso once a week you might have a decision of consequence -- for at least half of these you quickly figure out which choice is best and it no longer feels like a real decision in future attempts.\n\nThere is a fatigue system which can affect your characters, but there is nothing the player can do to avoid fatigue or mitigate it other than hoping for different random results.  So how interesting is it to read status reports about how fatigued each character is when you have no control over it whatsoever?   You can't assign them rest, and according to the devs exploring and rations  have no effect on it.\n\nUltimately, the game feels like a random result generator.\nSome of the events and outcomes are interesting and amusing enough that you want to play more to see more of them.\nAnd you do sometimes learn over time which decisions are better for certain events.\n\nBut for the most part the game doesn't feel like one where you have significant effect over the outcome.\n\nMaybe that's actually realistic in an odd way, when you've got a family in a bomb shelter and starving neighbors, there is an awful lot that is out of your control.\n\nIt doesn't make for compelling gameplay however.\n\nThe devs promise to add a lot more event content in the future.\nI hope as the game evolves the players feel like they have more of an impact on the outcome.","June 26, 2015","true","43.4"," 100 of 118 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","100","118","4","0"

I wanted more of its quirky, charming, art style and music. I wanted more of its scavenging mechanics. I wanted more crazy radiation filled events. From turning into a giant cockroach being, to dealing with raiders. 60 Seconds captures the dark humor of living in a post apocalyptic world.\nThe game is broken up into two parts. The first being a randomly generated house scene where items you need are scattered around the house. You collect much needed supplies, family, and other items in the limited time of sixty seconds. After you hop into the bomb shelter this part of the game is done and gone. While this works well and makes playthroughs unique. Offering replay as you never know what your going to get. However I felt this area could've been explored more. Especially when you get to the bunker. Which brings you to second part of the game. The survival aspects are fun to manage. Keeping track of what food and water is left and the random events that occur. Watching your characters slowly degrade from the bright chipper 1950's family. Into some horrible nightmare version of themselves. You will choose what to use and who to send out for more supplies. While the logbook is an enjoyable read. I would've liked to seen the outside world. Actually scavenged for the food and water that I so desperately needed. See the house from beginning in its new state. This is where I feel 60 Seconds missed a great chance. Adding more of its humor and quirky art style and raising the stakes to put your fate in your own hands.\n\nIn spite of this, 60 Seconds is a fun bite sized game. Each play session can last anywhere from 20 to 40 minutes and It never over stays its welcome. I just hope there is enough random events and outcomes to keep me in the bunker.\n\nI made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/V9jAr1R-MeI\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","May 25, 2015","true","3.2"," 86 of 108 people (80%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","80","86","108","12","4"

At least if the real apocalypse is anything like this game. I probably won't be saving my family once the bomb hits, 'cause all they do is eat my soup and drink my water. Yes, my soup and my water. It's mine 'cause I was the one that grabbed it before we ran to the bunker.\n\nIf my lovely wife or children would have grabbed anything useful it could be theirs, but they didn't so it's mine. Mine, mine, mine.\nDon't worry guys, I'm not gonna let you starve or die of dehydration, now that I've rescued you and taken you with me into the bunker. All I'm saying is, that I'm sharing my soup and my water with you, so the least you can do is stop complaining how you're tired of eating soup and would prefer apple juice to water. I mean, guess what? I'd prefer being in a shelter with someone who doesn't try to poison me with bug spray, while calling it medicine.\n\nAlso, don't open the bunker for everyone that knocks. Yes, there may be nice guys out there who need our help, but if those nice guys were also smart guys, they would hide out inside their own bunker, with their own soup and water and wouldn't try to get mine.\n\nGood thing I don't have a wife or kids, otherwise I'd spend the 60 seconds I have to grab stuff to take with me into the bunker, contemplating wether to save them or grab a gas mask or maybe the flashlight. How do you weight the importance of little Timmy versus the usefulness of a functioning radio? Ok, not fair for little Timmy. I'll definitely grab the radio. But come on Timmy, you have two healthy legs, there are sirens going off, just get yourself into the bunker. It's not like I'd throw you out, if you go into it by yourself. Sending you on a mission to grab some supplies is not throwing you out, little Timmy. You have a fair chance of making it back to the bunker alive. At least usually a better chance than your sister Mary Jane. She's a bit unlucky.\n\nGood thing Dolores doesn't complain when one of her kids die. It's a little weird though... Shouldn't she at least feel something when we're told that little Mary Jane isn't coming back to the bunker, 'cause the raiders captured her? All she ever does is tell me how she wants something to eat or if I can spare some water for her. Come on, Dolores. Your kid just got captured by savages and you don't feel anything? Really? Nothing? This situation really makes me wonder what I saw in you all those years ago. Why did we get married? Also, am I really little Timmy's father? Really? He looks nothing like me.\nIf we ever make it out of this alive Dolores, I think we need to have a long conversation.\n","June 28, 2015","true","2.2"," 48 of 54 people (89%) found this review helpful 60 people found this review funny","89","48","54","60","0"

You have 60 seconds to gather as many supplies as possible (that includes your family, maybe?) and hurry down to the fallout shelter! There are different game modes too - Anyway: Once in the shelter and depending on what items you looted beforehand, you'll have to ration food and water throughout the occupants in the fallout shelter (be wise). You can interact with certain items that you looted, for example: the radio. Turn the radio on to hear if it is safe or not to come out. If that doesn't sound interesting, you can make Ted or his family go out and scavenge. Scavenging can be dangerous but sometimes strategic if you're lucky.\n\nDuring your shelter time, some random events will occur that can affect the outcome of your survival. These events will make you choose to answer knocks on the door, for example. You can never know what will happen until you're put in the situation.\n\nMy Opinion60 Seconds! is an interesting game, and different I may add. During the 60 seconds you have to throw everything down the shelter is nerve wracking, because you are always looking at the timer. They give you enough time to gather as many things as possible - some may probably disagree. It is quite the challenge. It's pretty hilarious that you can choose to bring your family or not. Not sure how it will play out if you don't bring any of them.\n\nThere's a lot of reading involved when you're in the fallout shelter. You can skim through paragraphs after paragraphs of text, but sometimes when you need to make a strategic decision, that may come at a price. I find it easier to skip the nonsense and read the important parts. I guess if the reading portion was a big more exciting to read it wouldn't be so bad; however, I'm not a reader like most people unless it is a game changer. Reading is pretty important around when certain events appear or when someone is back from scavenging.\n\nThe UI is very simple and easy to work with, AND the tutorial was just awesome. However, during the tutorial I couldn't skip on forward after the military guy (forgot his name) said, "Use the grab button to skip". The grab button is Left Mouse Button since that's what Ted grabs items with. Perhaps I read it wrong? Nonetheless, I prevailed!\n\nI survived 32 days only because Ted died of thirst and my family died 2 days before.\n\nOverallI'm enjoying this game. I recommend it to anyone that enjoy these types of games, and I hope my review can help you decide whether to buy 60 Seconds! or not.\n\nRating: 8/10","December 23, 2015","true","0.6"," 48 of 59 people (81%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","81","48","59","5","0"

You lead a lovely, peaceful life with your family until the nuclear apocalypse strikes. Now, you have 60 Seconds to decide what’s important enough to bring into the shelter with you… and survive as long as possible.\n\n60 Seconds is not quite what I expected it to be, though in all honesty I’m not sure entirely what I was expecting of the game, but it has its charm still.\nIt is, in its core, a survival text adventure with some mild dark comedy thrown in. Yes, there’s a part that’s kind of action-y (the initial 60 seconds of it), but it’s played for such small amount of time it’s hardly noticeable, even if the contents are quite relevant to the development of the story.\n\nLet’s split it up.\n\nEntering the game you’re presented with the options (not counting the tutorial): A regular game, which includes the action part and the survival part; a scavenging game (which includes just the action/scavenging part) and the survival part (which is survival/text adventure, mostly, with randomly generated resources).\nEach game play style has three modes: easy, medium and hard. I rather enjoyed that they would give us the freedom to choose which part we liked best to play, rather than force us to do both play styles in one go.\n\nOn the action/scavenging part of the game, you have 60 seconds to gather as many items/resources as you can, toss them in your shelter, and enter it yourself. You find all this in your house: your house is randomly generated with each new game, so that the items and rooms are never in the same place. The items you can get range from food and water, to your family, radio, axe, gun, gas mask and other survival items. At the end of the 60 seconds, you must be within a certain area near the shelter, or risk not surviving the apocalypse yourself. To make matters more complex, you have only four slots, and some items take up two slots, so you’ll have to make several trips to the shelter to get everything there.\n\nThe graphics on this part of the game are 3D cartoony; they feel kind of awkward to me, and so do the controls. You move with wasd and turn with the mouse, but turning takes too long. You grab the items with a mouse click, but in order to grab it you have to be facing it almost perfectly (the white outline will turn red) and as I’ve just stated, turning is really friggin’ hard, making the whole 60 seconds section super frustrating. Still wanting to up the complexity of the controls, furniture will be in your way, which means you can bump into it and drag it along, slowing you down. This would, again, be much less annoying if you could turn without having to move your mouse in 500 circles per quarter of a turn.\n\nThus, a section of the game that could have been quite fun was instead rendered quite annoying and frustrating (in case the first 50 times I said it was annoying and frustrating wasn’t understood… )\n\nOnce the 60 seconds are up, you move on to the survival part.\n\nCongratulations! You’ve survived the bomb! But now you must survive until you are rescued. This is the part of the game I enjoyed the most, even if some of the texts and outcomes became both a bit repetitive and predictable.\n\nYou switch from the 3D cartoony graphics to 2D cartoony graphics. I wasn’t overly fond of the art style at first, but it grew on me, and now it just seems to fit the mood of the game quite well.\nOn this screen you will be presented with however many survivors and resources you threw into the shelter.\nEach day you will go through the same motions: you open up the notebook, and it will tell you a little story, what’s going on with the family, what’s needed, etc… Each day you can ration food and water to them (or not). Every so often you will get story prompts: send someone to the surface, fix this, kill that, solve a problem, etc… and you may not always be able to do them all, depending on if you have the item needed for it or not.\n\nThe graphics, though mostly still, are quite dynamic. You see the family change as days go on and things happen: they will look different when sick or hurt, when hungry or crazy, they will grow beards, get dirty, etc…\n\nFor the most I enjoyed this part, but it was a bit bothersome that no adults in the bunker meant you instantly died. I could understand it if only the youngest boy was the only one to have survived, but I’m fairly sure the teenage girl is capable of at the very least open a can of soup/bottle of water, so I think it’s rather unfair that if she’s left alone she ‘dies’ the very next day. I should at the very least be allowed to play her until she actually truly dies too or runs out of resources or whatever.\n\n60 Seconds has some very amusing parts when it comes to the text, if rather dark in nature, but it can also be quite frustrating to play in the scavenging part. I feel like the problems turning and grabbing things should be considered more as a bug than as something they should’ve done to make the 60 seconds more difficult, and I hope they will consider fixing it in the future. (Yes, I know, the bug report sticky says it’s fixed, but it’s still too slow for me even after having gone to the settings).\n\nI also hope they will add more endings as even in a short play through some of the events and endings repeated. Aside from that, 60 seconds can be quite an enjoyable game, particularly as you can choose to replay whichever section you have a preference for without having to forcibly do the other. It won’t be amazing, and it’s probably not worth quite the full price (maybe pricing it $5 would be better than $10), but it’s not a bad game at all.","August 12, 2015","true","5.1"," 35 of 42 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","35","42","0","5"

In this game you have 60 seconds to gather as many resources as you can to take to your shelter.(Food,water, weapons, and other supplies) And after that you try to survive in the shelter in till you die or get rescued. And while you're in the shelter various scenarios occur that affect your family's lives, health, and thoughts. And not only that, but there is a journal kept that explains everything going on in a funny timely manner.\n\nNegatives:\nAnd there are some negatives of this great game:\n-Low replayability- Although the game is fun, you can't really play the game for more than a hour without getting bored, so it's better if you play the game every other day.\n-Events and scenarios tend to be similar every time you play- Each game I play I experience similar events, The famous "Earth Quake" is one that I almost always witness when I play the game, which always results in an object getting broken. Unless that is supposed to occur.\n-Sickness- Sickness is a huge factor in the game for me. Every time a family member gets sick they almost have no chance of living unless they get cured by a medkit.\n\nAlthough the game has some negative problems with it, it is a new game that was just released a few days ago and the developer is actually concerned with what the players are complaining about. With promises about big updates in the future fixing the game and adding more. So I rate this game 8/10 cans of Tomato Soup.\n","May 29, 2015","true","9.8"," 30 of 34 people (88%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","88","30","34","11","0"

A single playing of this game will last about an hour or  so.  The funnest part is the first 2 minutes(running around the house to grab stuff), the other 58 minutes is spent flipping through pages basically just reading text and answering questions.  This part drags a bit.  Especially since I can't seem to get rescued in under 60 days in the bunker.\n\nThe game would be loads better if there were some mini games interspersed through the bunker stage.  For example, when someone leaves to go get food, they could use the same engine as the beginning and you control your character running around the wasteland to find items to bring back while avoiding hazards.  If they could address this portion of the game it would be much more enjoyable.  Or maybe when the person arrives to gamble for water, you actually play cards(if even just choosing whether to fold or bet).  One more idea:  when the bugs come in you play a little mini game to smash them with whatever tools you have(varying in effectiveness).\n\nI realize this game is only $10 and am rating it accordingly.  I would give it 3 out of 5 stars but since I can only recommend yes or no, Im going with no.  In its current state there are better games out there to spend $10 on.","October 2, 2015","false","13.0"," 130 of 203 people (64%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","64","130","203","12","0"

Beyond the initial mad-dash to find and store your family and survival gear, the game basically plays out like a Choose Your Own Adventure novel, though perhaps that's a bit unfair as those novels at least had variations in the pictures from page to page.  The survival side of it plays out a bit like the choices from time to time in the "Rebuild" series, in that they are entirely text based.  Even scavenging, supposedly a life or death event in the story of the game, happens off-screen and with no input or guidance from the player.  To see something like this done right, look at the game "This War of Mine", where scavenging was a nerve-wracking, nail biting, nightmare inducing event that happened just about every night in the game cycle.  Here, you send your son out to scavenge, he never returns... something bad happened I guess?  Your daughter runs off because of lack of water and you're treated to... the same still 2d pic of your character.  No, wait, there's now an empty chair, very profound.\n\nLook I get with the cartoony graphics the game clearly was not going for the same feel as This War of Mine, even if the underlying mechanics are largely the same.  But with the game being almost entirely text based, little interaction, the style disconnected from the 1950's fallout shelter feel the tutorial tries to invoke... all of it just misses.  You're basically playing the original Rebuild without zombies, buildings, or skilled survivors.  You're playing TWOF without the actual game.","August 22, 2015","false","1.0"," 73 of 109 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","73","109","2","0"

Sure, there's that initial rush to grab as much as you can, so it lives up to its name fairly well. but 60 seconds of gameplay is an apt description. "Scavenge hunts" is just sending a living family member up with a chance to eventually come back with a few random items. Everything else is whittling down objects and feeding or not feeding people.

Buy this game on sale.  I like it as a game to play for a few minutes every now and then, but it's still not worth $10 unless they start updating and adding more items and scenarios regularly.\n\nThe scavenging part of the game is only minor, thankfully (and, like the name implies, only for a minute.)  The controls are wonky, you can be standing with your face on an item and not be able to pick it up, and your family is completely useless and wastes a significant portion of your time to get their stupid asses into the shelter.\n\nOnce you finish (or mercifully skip) that, the game is fun if repetitive.  If you somehow manage to be good at scavenging, it becomes even more repetitive once you learn what the important items are and go straight for those.  For that reason, I usually skip right to the "survival" mode, to get randomized items and family members.  The bulk of the game is reading the journals of each day's happenings in order to ration supplies, make decisions on who to send out exploring, and how to deal with random events.  Fairly unique take on survival games, full of dark humor.\n\n7/10 - great potential if the game was updated regularly.  Or, ya know, at all.","April 30","true","3.1"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","93","14","15","4","0"

According to Beren, “60 Seconds! is released on the promise that all future DLC would be free and forthcoming.”\n\nHowever, I did not purchase this game in a “pre-release” state; I purchased it in an advertised “complete” state, for $10.00.  I (and many others) have learned my lesson the hard way, by supporting a game in a pre-release state, only to have the game rushed and “released complete” -- i.e. unfulfilled, buggy, unplayable, etc. etc.  The mantra from the devs is then “DLC, DLC, DLC ….”\nUsually after months, if not longer, the game is somewhat patched, in a semi-stable/semi-playable state … and then basically abandoned by the developers, who have moved onto a new project, leaving the consumers/gamers burned and without an enjoyable game.  In essence, it’s a cash grab for a bait ‘n switch product, and it happens a HUGE majority of the time when dealing with independent studios.\n\nSo at Beren’s suggestion of re-playing the game with its new DLC, I gave the game a second-chance and disregarded the fact that I should have already had a completed game to play, as opposed to waiting around for DLC.  I can report, that after playing the game with the new DLC, I feel as though I have been put through the ringer of one of the most elaborate troll-jokes ever.\n\nI was expecting the DLC to have added any type of actual gameplay or substantial level building to the almost non-existent, present content.  It does not.  From what I can tell, it has added a whopping two items (a briefcase and padlock), maybe an added music track and a few minor decision branches.\n\nAs it stands now, with added DLC, the game consists of a 60-second, item collection mini-game and then one screen with very basic, almost not existent flash animation.  Let me repeat: $10.00 game with a 60-second mini-game and one flash animation screen.\n\nThey devs obviously worked harder on the intro (which is by far the most interesting part of this “game”), because that’s the new industry norm: Make a great demo for your game idea, shop that idea around at conventions and on Steam, sell a shell of that game idea at top dollar and finally hope to produce enough DLC to satisfy the contract before moving onto the next project.\n\nWith what has been produced and released to-date, at absolute best, this is a mobile game which should be sold as an app for $0.99.  I can see it as a silly little time-waster on your phone or something, but it has no business being released for the PC.\n\n60 Seconds! Is a great idea for a game.  The devs have caught the feel, mood, dark humor and music which perfectly captures 1950 Cold War.  They’ve sold this package for $10.00 ….\nNow where’s the actual game?\n\nThis is an open forum, and I really encourage an open dialogue with the devs on these points listed.  I am genuinely interested in coming to some type of happy medium on these concerns – perhaps I’m missing something?  I’m certainly willing to listen and discuss. **********\n\n\n\n**EDIT SEPT 9th 2015**\n********Well -- Free DLC appears to be on it's way in a matter of days.  Free DLC now, and free future DLC ... as expressed by the devs themselves (see comments section below).  I've said numerous times this game has promise, so I am hopeful it will be good.  So while a thumbs down ATM, maybe my opinion will change with the DLC.  Will update when DLC is avaiable. **********\n\n*******************************************************************************************************************\n*****************************    ORIGINAL REVIEW SEPT. 7th, 2015 **************************\n\nThis is a very shallow game, especially for a $10 asking price -- It's actually more of a novelty than a game.\n\nYou have three different game settings to choose from: The full game (both the 60 second scavage into and "survival" portion), and then just the scavage (frustrating and lackluster) or just the "survival" portion (the main bulk, 99% of the game)\n\nIt's ironic that the actual 60 Seconds portion is the least interesting part of the game, and I reccomend just playing the "survival" portion, since you are automatically started with far more supplies and items than you could have ever hoped collecting manually.\n\nWith that said, I use quotations when I mention the "survival" portion of the game, because there is zero substance to it.  You are faced with 1 scenerio a day, where you are basically spoon-fed which item to use.  Or, should you open up your door, because someone is knocking -- 50% chance they want to trade, 50% chance they will kill you and end the game.\nAlso, the journal messages you "Ted is hungry and will not survive one more day without soup!"  So you click on the soup  can, and he goes back to full health for a few more days.  That is all.\n\nWhen you compare this game to another of it's genre -- let's say "This War of Mine" -- it is literally like burning a $10 bill on a game so woefully inadequate when you could actually be playing a much better game like TWOM.\n\nYou are basically paying $10 for a sorta-funny intro and a chuckle here of there.  Other than that ... you'll instantly regret parting with your time and money with this title.  Such a shame, too -- it's a very interesting concept; one which this game fails to deliver in any shape or form.","September 5, 2015","false","1.9"," 55 of 91 people (60%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","60","55","91","4","9"

Other similar games with a scavenge/survival phase do not have an actual mechanic like this or a different form of it. Personally speaking, I seriously like how you can decide what to take in that very 60 seconds which will determine failure or not.\n\nSo the game has four modes of plays, the first one being the Tutorial mode which will walk you through the simple necessities for survival in a nuclear shelter as well as enable you to explore with plenty of time in your home. Followed by the Apocalypse mode which combines scavenging as well as survival. Then Scavenge mode in which you can practice more with scavenging goods. Does not include survival mode however. And lastly Survival mode, which skips the scavenging part of the game and randomizes what and whom you brought with you to the shelter. At all times must one adult remain in the shelter lest it be taken by hostile forces.\n\nYou're Ted, the main family person of the game. You cannot choose another player, I hope the developers do consider being able to choose the other adult, Dolores or add more characters to play or find. He can hold up to "4 hands" worth of goods or people. His family first:\n\nDolores, his wife 2 hands. His daughter, Mary Jane 3 hands. I assume this is because of her tuba, which I don't see back in the shelter. And his son, Timmy, 2 hands. Remember, you do not need to take all of them with you, since more people will mean more mouths to feed and drink. But more options to choose from going out to scavenge.\n\nFollowed by the goods:\nCans of soup. 1 hand per can. This is the only thing you can eat. Yes, we're running in a tomato economy here!\nBottles of water. 1 hand per bottle. This is also the only thing you can drink!\nBoth of the above 1 can/1 bottle = 4 uses.\n\nMedical kit. 2 hands. Used to combat unable to sleep, healing up any kind of injury or sickness. One use only in most events.\nGas Mask. 1 hand. With this the chance of getting ill outside from radiation is greatly reduced.\nAmmunition. 1 hand. Seems to have some special events tied with it.\nChecker board. 1 hand. Seems to combat boredom.\nCards. 1 hand. Same as above. Also useful in gambling.\nMap. 1 hand. Quite useful for locating objectives in special events.\nRadio. 1 hand. With this you can hear what the army is planning as well as other special events. Very useful.\nFlashlight. 1 hand. You can shine in the dark with this in some events.\nBoy's Scout Book. 1 hand. Can be used to learn how to effectively repair things in events as well as giving out hints when clicked.\nAxe. 2 hands. Can be great as multi-purpose tool including combat situations.\nRifle. 2 hands. Great for self defense!\n\nRemember, you only have 60 seconds. with different difficulty modes you have more time to scout your home before being able to ultimately grab things you think you need.\n\nPositive features:\n+ I like how you can scavenge goods!\n+ And in turn, they can by your decision affect your playthroughs!\n+ Visual representation of things when they break or are used up!\n+ In addition of above, you can also see if your survivors are tired, sick or wounded!\n+ Events have multiple choices!\n+ Multiple endings!\n+ Active devs on twitter as well on the forums!\n+ A lot of events!\n+ Achievements!\n\nSome remarks:\n= Could be nice if you could choose another person to start the game with. Or unlockable characters. Or find other characters to live with.\n= Some events will force you to choose between saving 1 item but unable to save the other items despite having 3 other family members with you...\n= Unclear what status effects does what. Devs did explain on the forums after questioning it though.\n= Could do with mooooooooooooooore items. Mooooore events? =3\n= If only the characters in your home could help you scavenge after you 'nudge' them that there's a nuclear attack incoming. Like taking one item and fleeing to the shelter. Only in Little Boy (easy mode!) :P\n= Would like a choice where to scavenge if possible during survival mode? Maybe if you have the map?\n= Is the shelter truly that weak if it can be forced open when in certain events you can turn visitors away?\n= Reliance on certain items can be very high (gas mask, medical kit) once they're up, you're basically in some serious trouble.\n\nNegative Aspects:\n- When you're well stocked you have to wait until *that* special event that determines the next step on what to-do. In the meantime nom nom and drink drink.\n- After the upteenth time shooting and driving away the bandits, I don't really think that the bandits would come back for the eleventh or twelfth time yet again or to be driven away again. With no possibility of going outside because they're outside there is no chance of survival anymore once your supplies are up, only doom.\n\nConclusion: The game offers a fun and special scavenging experience in which you only have 60 seconds to determine what is most valuable to you, and thus in turn affects what you can do and survive for in the shelter. I feel that it is worth the money as I'm getting closer to the 10 hour mark (€1 = 1 hour atleast!) and the game has not even been out for a full day yet! The Devs are active as well there is a bug thread + suggestion thread up so buy the game, play it and chime in while the discount of -15% lasts!\n\nDisclaimer Last!\nDue to Steam messing up release timers the game was released well 2 hours after midnight, the developers kindly granted me a pre-release key for Steam's mess up.","May 26, 2015","true","10.1"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","11","13","3","0"

Conceptually and visually it looks pretty great, but the way it plays out gets extremeley repetitive and tedious to do continuous runs, re-reading the same text over and over (but randomly sequenced) and hoping that the options you choose lead to the desired outcome.  Unfortunately, the game is also much less about strategic survival choices and often the RNG will condemn you down a path of death even when you choose the best or "correct" options.  Alas, the game design does not do a good enough job of creating frustration-free variation and the illusion of player control with non-linearity; it ends up feeling like you're just choosing some fork on a tree diagram and hoping the fork RNG doesn't lead to an unrecoverable dead-end.","April 13","false","9.6"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","16","24","4","0"

The game is very well put together, it has great humor and many references to the Fallout universe an some other pop culture references.\n\nCons: The controls in the opening part where you scavenge supplies are a bit junk; slow clicking speed; annoying hit boxes on objects, granted it's only 60-80 seconds long. Though the humor and game play is fun, it gets stale after about 2-3 hours of game play. There isn't much in the way of randomness other then events, and you pretty much can encounter every game play joke,choice or event within one play through. It feels like an IOS game as the entirety of the games controls is just clicking.*\n\nPrice: Even on sale for 5$ again it feels like a $1.99 IOS game and should be priced as such*.\n\nFinal thoughts: Its a good game, just its not on the right platform. If the prices was lowered and the developer and steam added mobile gaming support though the steam app in the future this title would out class a lot of IOS games and would be worth the pick up.","December 23, 2015","false","1.6"," 33 of 56 people (59%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","59","33","56","7","0"

Not worth the high price tag\n\n\nThe game is split into 2 parts.  The first part lasts 60 seconds where you run around the house and try to grab supplies for your bunker.  The second half of the game has you surviving in your shelter.\n\nThe problem with the second part, which takes up most of the game, is that it's very passive.  It's not like you actually do anything, you just react or select options in scenarios based on what items you were able to gather.  For instance, if you picked up a deck of cards, you might be presented with the option to... play cards.\n\nAn entire game lasts about 15 minutes and there is virtually no replayability because there is no strategy involved.  Just clicking through a number of pre-generated scenarios.\n\nIf this game had been $1.99 on the app store, I would have had no regrets.  However for the price it's listed at, it's just not enough game for the dollar.","July 18, 2015","false","0.7"," 19 of 31 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","19","31","0","0"

The first time I played it I found it to be incredibly fun for a $10 indie title. It has a variety of different gamemodes and playstyles to suit your preferance. I believe for what the game is, it has a perfect balance of an initial mad dash for loot followed by a quest for wasteland surivial that is not in your favor. Some people will argue that the game is far too text based and that it is missing some intense combat and looting through your characters eyes, but I know that developers made the right decision by limiting movement and action to the beginning. The random events and abundance of choices are some of things that make the gameplay feel very rewarding and making a trumph all the more worth it due to your small change of sucess in amlost every scenario. One of the main reasons I bought this game is that unlike amost every single new game for sale on steam today, this game is not in early access and never was in early access. It is much more rewarding to play a game that is not lacking content as most games do these days. Hats off to the devs for packing so much fun into a seemingly small game. Your possiblities are endless in your quest for survival in the wastleland and in your humble bunker alike.

Insanity is real and if Ted goes insane, game over, he'll run away. A challenging survival game based in the nuclear fallout that could've happened during WWII. You get only 1 minute to gather everything you can, so be sure to note where things are prior to that one minute. If you don't gather enough or save too many people, you will run out of supplies very quickly in the shelter. Keep sicknesses in check or it will kill your people, and many other things provide challenges based on RNG. The overall feel to the game is cartoonish with tongue and cheek comedy, and it has some interesting easter eggs in it. I'd give it a 7/10 , it's fun and worth a playthrough at least once! Different outcome everytime almost gurranteed.","June 2, 2015","true","1.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

I think this is a beautiful game, where it shows real life problems, and sprinkles comedy in there! there are two "major" "bugs", but they are both avoidable. The first- (at least for me) the game crashes after the intro, skip the intro. The turning is laggy during the beginning stage (especially if you have a lot of crap on the computer, which i do), I just skip the first part entirely, and i heard hooking up a controller works as well. I love the humor in the game, the only complaint is that some situations (bandits threatening to break down my door and the radio saying I need to cut down trees - my axe broke when healing Mary Jane earlier, so i dont know what happens if you cut down the trees, but it would be close to impossible to think up new situations in a game where you can survive for over 113 days (my record is 113, timmy ran away because he was sick, the wife was taken while scavenging, mary jane burst through the door because i didnt talk to her, and the shelter was overrun by a preacher while ted was scavenging) I like how most actions have consequences. i think it was worth all 10$, but if you dont like repeditivity, slightly crude humor, or mutant cockroaches, i recomend a different game. if you are fine with everything i listed, play it!","June 29, 2015","true","10.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","6","8","2","0"

The title is right though, you have 60 seconds of gameplay and then rest is a text based adventure, it has potential to become a good game and the concept is good but it's so basic and barebones that I couldn't really enjoy it. I honestly think the most enjoyable part was the first 60 seconds...\n\nFor now I could only recommend the game to those who enjoy text based adventures, but unfortunately that's about as far as this game goes, worst of all it's quite repetitive early on and it doesn't really give you a lot of choices. I personally don't find games like this enjoyable, if it had a little bit more in the way of 'actual' exploration then I think it would've been a lot better.","December 10, 2015","false","0.5"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","9","14","0","0"

The previews are misleading, the gameplay isn't anything like they show.  The 3D part of the game, where you run around for a minute, grabbing supplies, has poor controls, poor hit detection for grabbing things (which is REALLY important!), needless slowdowns, and delays in picking up items after clicking them... very frustrating.  Repetitive music, and all of maybe 3 different sounds for interacting with your environment make the game sound like either a high school intro to programming class assignment, or a very, very unfinished and undeveloped game that barely qualifies as a beta build.\n\nThe gameplay is kinda of like full metal jacket (movie), only terrible, and feels like 2 seperate, unrelated games.  The first minute of the game is spent frantically and frustratingly trying to grab useful supplies, with hints from a radio on what you'll probably need, which isn't fun at all.  Poor controls/hit detection aside, this task isn't remotely entertaining... running between rooms to grab stuff in the open and obvious environment of the house serves no purpose, and this part of the game could have just as easily been replaced by a menu where you just check boxes for what you want, because there's no challenge in grabbing it.  Sadly, this chapter of the game, which I thought had kind of appealing graphics, represented the gameplay, and is the best area for them to expand upon ends after only a minute, leading to the next, even more poorly executed chapter.\n\nAfter grabbing supplies, the gamplay completely changes one you get in your shelter... no more 3D world to interact with anymore, just a static image of your characters sitting around a table in a boring room, with nothing for you to interact with.  The only movement on screen is a very annoying fly, which kept tricking me into thinking there was a fly on my monitor, which I didn't appreciate, although in the game's defense, I guess that means at least something was done well!  So anyways, this boring, static image is the last thing you'll see in this game, because it's the entireity of the gameplay from here on out.  Your characters' show signs of sickness and health, otherwise, not much changes.\n\nYou start each day with the monotonous, boring task of assigning who in the party gets food, water, or medicine that day.  You do this by clicking the only clickable thing, your "survival log," which is annoyingly in the bottom right corner of the screen.  It pops up, and gives you a report on the day's events, and your character's health, so you don't even need the graphical representation at all.  The authors of the journal content think they're a lot more funny than they are... Talking about dancing cockroaches in a nuclear war OVER AND OVER AND OVER again was never entertaining, and popped up almost every one of the 40ish days I survived my first time playing.  After reading the poorly-written (it's seriously high-school level content... not the grammar or spelling, just the low quality) story about the day and assigning resources to characters, the next page allows you to choose to send an explorer topside to try to scavenge things (presuming at least one is in good enough health to do so), or not, and a subsequent page lets you give them items to take with them (gas mask, axe, etc).  Once those few, grindy, obvious, monotonous tasks are done, you click finish... and that's literally the entire game.  That journal cycle repeats, with some random events destroying or giving you resources, and minor decisions needing to be made every day, until either you survive until a random day that the military rescues you, or your party dies.\n\nThe entire game could have been text based, and programmed on a TI-82 calculator by a novice programmer in just a day or two, tops... very sophomoric, and very disappointing.\n\nThe developers need to fix their 3D engine issues, make that part of the game play smooth, as well as expand it to be 99% of the gameplay... why the heck are we clicking characters to send them scavenging for supplies on their own, while the player is stuck in the boring bunker?  We should be playing as those players, scavenging, fighting, avoiding danger, and bartering with NPCs, not having it done off screen!\n\nIn short, this game has a lot of major problems with it, but hope isn't lost, they have the development room to save the title and make it fun to play, but in all honesty, the concept and playstyle has already been done much better by This War of Mine, and it'd take a lot of ingenuity to differentiate 60 Seconds! from it, and stand on its own merits.","September 14, 2015","false","0.9"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","12","20","0","0"

"60 Seconds!" is a brilliant game made for those who think that graphics are not everything about a game.\n\nWhy this name?At the beginning you are warned about a nuclear strike and you have 60 seconds to pickup supplies and your loved ones into your home shelter. I could feel the beating of my heart right when i was running out of time and i still needed to pickup more water or find out where was my fat daughter or my mad wife. After that, the game should be called "60 hours" because that's the amount of time you want to play it without a single break.\n\nMy thoughts about this game:Some reviews are all about being funny and others are not even close. It's hard to talk about this game only being serious because it has the ability of surprising you in the most ridiculous ways. You start as Ted, the "man of the house" whose wife Dolores will left him at the first sign of problems. You have a lovely daughter called Mary Jane who is hungry all the time and Timmy: the typical kid who is a "good boy". The real challenge of this game is to create your own adventure and trying to survive the previous choices that you made. You will need to ration your food and water and try to decide if you're choosing to open your door to whatever is knocking or not (maybe can be your salvation, maybe your doom). Everytime the day ends and the screen goes black you hope something good happens, the game "catches" you and you just want to know what happen next: Will your daughter become a strange purple hulk with a troll face? (yes, i am not joking) Will your son Timothy run away because you are not treating him well? Or will your lovely wife spend the rest of her life doing "chicken wings" with her arms because she lost her sanity? I have spent many hours looking at the same screen, watching Ted's beard grow and my supllies disappear and you know what? It was time well spent.\n\nConclusion:"60 Seconds!" is not hard, it's very hard. Just like your life you have to deal with what you do, take responsability of your actions and decide if the world is giving you an opportunity or not. You are not living in the 60's or in a world destroyed by a nuclear war but everytime i face a game that makes me think i will press "like" and tell my friends about it. I don't remember if i bought it on sale or in full-price but it was worth every cent. I hope you are thinking the same because if you are reading this it means you are thinking in buying it. That's a great choice and i am proud of you","January 26","true","8.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","6","9","4","0"

Most of the GAME is played in the first 60 seconds where you have to grab everything you need. The rest of your hour-ish is spent trudging through to the conclusion of your choices. The second part lacks substance, and you'll quickly tire of reading through endless pages of statuses and choices.

A simple concept executed with a brilliant balance of complexity and addictabillity.\n\nEasy, mediumm, or hard, you only get 60 seconds - hence the name of the game - to collect supplies (including your loved ones) from your house, before a mad dash to take cover in your underground bomb-shelter as your neighbourhood is being nuked above.\n\nYou can perfect your gathering skills in Scavenger mode, hone your stamina skills in survival mode, or play out a complete scenario in Apocalypse mode - in which you first scavenge your supplies and family, and then see how long you can hold out in your shelter with just the supplies you've brought with you.\n\nQuite soon you will find it necessary to go out into the radiated wasteland of suburbia for more supplies. Well, not always you ... often it's your children. You will encounter various events and make life or death decisions along the way. Things can get quite brutal.\n\nLight humour and cartoon style makes this a great game the whole family can enjoy.

There may not be much gameplay, but the little gameplay that there is, can turn the tables on if you get rescued or not. The strategy part of this game is amazing, it produces many different scenarios each game you play, while also making very tough decisions to make, such as which sick/injured person should get the ONLY MEDKIT! Which makes the game take a turn. You may get rescued out of chance, or if you're really good at the game. I highly recommend you check this game out and play it for a bit, and maybe you could even survive the horrors of the wasteland!

Is definitely fun, although there's not much variety in events. All of the makes of a great game are here, and it's definitely very difficult to keep yourself from losing people.\n\nThe basics of the game go like this:\n1) Start in a house filled with stuff, you have 60 seconds to obtain all of the materials you have and literally throw them down a hatch (including your family lol).\n2) Make it down the hatch before the 60 seconds are up, if you don't you're down 1 man from the get go.\n3) Survive until you start getting military radio broadcasts telling you some task the military wants you to complete.\n4) Complete said tasks.\n5) After completing some amount of tasks actually open the door to let the military rescue you (this is actually a scary choice to make since they could potentially be raiders).\n\nAll in all it's a fun game, but like I said at the beginning there's not a ton of variety in the random events, there's a pool of maybe 30 events it feels like. Also the military events that occur require you to have a random item to complete them, and since you get most of your stuff at the beginning and then just sporadically and uncommonly find them from then on it can feel like the actual "win condition" of the game is way more luck based than skill based. This isn't to say survival is easy though. It just feels like survival is more a roll of the dice than anything you choose to do or not to do.\n\nOverall I'd say it's a very good game, has an amazing thematic and art style it sticks to very well, and can be a little humorous at times. It just doesn't have quite enough content for me to say it's one of the best indies released recently.\n\nI'll give it a 7/10 for those of you who are too lazy and don't want to bother reading pros and cons and decide how good it is for yourself.","May 26, 2015","true","2.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The graphics of the game are simple, in a 2d style. The music is decent, and does a good job of setting the tone throughout the game. The game also offers numerous steam achievements, which is appreciated.\n\nThe premise of the game is that there is a global disaster (nuclear) and you are given 60 seconds at the beginning of the game to grab up whatever supplies you can for your basement disaster shelter. This includes food, weapons, first aid, and family members. The decisions on what you bring with you into the game drastically affect how the rest of the game plays out.  The rest of the game is more choose your own adventure, where you choose whether or not to venture outside for further supplies, how much or little food you can ration to family members and when.\n\nAs time progresses, you become attached and invested in the family's survival. Losing family members due to starvation or illness adds weight to the survivors atmosphere. You may be more willing to make more risky choices such as stealing from other survivors. Just because you are in a shelter does not necessarily mean that you will survive.\n\nThe goal of the game is to survive until the army comes to save you, but you don't know when, or if, that will happen. The game hits on the nature of humanity well, and forces you to make decisions that you wouldn't normally make, such as whether or not to put your life at risk to help others, or just try to survive on your own. It's a classic example of a game that's easy to play, but hard to master. The game never disrespects you, or make your time feels wasted. This is an easy recommend.\n\nThanks for your viewership and support; for more videos click here.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/c/SocioPsycho","December 26, 2015","true","2.0"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

If you're in to random chance, this game is for you. There's very little strategy involved, if really any at all. The game can decide to be nice to you, which is incredibly rare, but more often than not it just never gives you what you need when you desperately need it. It's humorous, but that wears off quickly when you have lost 49 out of your 50 games. Not to mention the controls for the very, VERY limited portion of the game of it's namesake where you have a minute to grab whatever you feel is essential to survive in your bomb shelter, are incredibly stiff and awkward, with items sandwiched next to each other, each item having different carrying capacity requirements that when combined end up making you grabbing things you didn't intend to get.\n\nHowever the difficulty of trying to actually survive in your nuclear fallout shelter is what really kills it for me.  With how precious certain items are, (I.E. the Radio, Scout Handbook, Medkit) there are too many events that occur that will destroy such invaluable items in one go and your only option is to save one of them if you actually have said items. Considering the only real way to replenish any lost items is to trek and scavenge the surface (of which you have absolutely no control over the fate of whoever gets sent), there's absolutely no guaruntee you'll ever get what you actually need. If the events don't destroy your items, there are other events at complete random with no warning, where you will face some bizarre scenario in which the only way to prevent your family from getting hurt, sick, going insane, is to have a very specific item(s), but a lot of times you won't actually have them because you either didn't bring with you intially to the shelter, got it destroyed in an event, used it already, or sent it out with a family member when they went scavenging to up your miniscule chance of getting ANOTHER specific item you desperately need (and will probably not get and end up losing that item you sent out with your family member, because that's a possibility too).\n\nTo add insult to injury on those compounded problems that are steadily mounting over your family, the scavenging portion is just as unforgiving and aggravating, which is literally, your only real lifeline to survivng. If you never scavenge, you will assuredly lose the game. Again, it's pure luck of the draw, even if you have a required item to help your family out scavenging, you still stand a pretty decent chance to have them come back hurt, sick, or just never come back (I.E. In the early portion of the game when radioactive fallout is a threat and you have a gas mask that's supposed to lessen your chances of your family getting sick, it's too common an occurance that they still get sick anyway, with that item being broken in the process somehow). Keep in mind, at this part of the game (which sadly consists of the majority of the time you will spend playing) besides making basic decisions such as nourishing your family with food+water, dealing with random RNG scenarios, and deciding when you send out someone on a scav run, EVERY SINGLE BIT OF IT, is completely up to random chance. ALL OF IT. So it's literally just pure luck whether or not your situation ever improves or deteriorates (the latter being frustratingly too common, even on normal difficulty). They should have named this game: "Gambling your life: Post-apocalyptic edition".\n\nSo unless that's really your thing, I absolutely do NOT recommend this game. 2 out of 10.","May 26","false","6.3"," 13 of 25 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","13","25","0","0"

You play a suburban dad during a nuclear apocalypse trying to survive with his family.. problem is you only have 1 minute to grab everything you need to survive for 20 days when the military will come and get you.\n\nControls are easy to learn and the game is a relatively simple point and click control system. There are several modes including apocalypse and scavenging each of which has different goals.\n\nMy only problem with this game is that the movement is somewhat glitched- even pressing space to make Ted move faster is not very effective. This is a problem when gathering supplies and family members. It is not a long game by a long shot but it is fun.. a lot of fun. I would recommend this for anyone who likes post apocalyptic survival games.","June 16, 2015","true","0.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Besides the choose-your-own-adventure style of story and the random encounters here and there, there are also a handful of things that make this game unique compared to other survival resource managers.\n\nFor starters, the biggest unique aspect of this game (maybe other games have something similar I don't know) is the game's namesake. At the start of each instance of this game you have 60 seconds to run around your house, which is a full (but not exactly award-winning) 3D environment where you have to gather supplies and family members. At all times you only have four inventories slots and certain items/all family members take up more than one slot, so you constantly have to pick up what you can, drop them all in the shelter, and repeat until the 60 seconds are up and you dive into the shelter yourself, leaving behind any goods and family members you didn't pick up. That's when the meat of the game comes out.\n\nThe bulk of the game after the mad dash to grab resources, the game becomes your standard resource manager text adventure when you have to work with the items and supplies that you gathered and ration the food and water you have between yourself and your family (if you brought any of them with you). The events are varied and interesting, and a lot of events reward you or punish you for grabbing or forgetting certain items during the 60 seconds. Somebody's trying to break into the shelter? Too bad you forgot to grab a weapon. You're out of medicine, but you can totally turn that bug spray into medicine without any side effects, right? Etc, Etc. There's also a reference to other games and such here and there, such as a man in blue asking you for a water chip, but I'm not certain of the variety of them all.\n\nIn terms of fine detail, one thing that really stands out to me about this game is your location constantly changes depending on the resources you have and the status of your family. Family members will be visibly sick and tired depending on the circumstances, while the resources you have will be shown sitting around the shelter as time goes on. These all change constantly, such as a flashlight breaking being shown as the flashlight sitting on it's usual space on the shelf but now broken or your son from being perfectly fine to having an empty soup can on his head because he went nuts.\n\nAs far as quality goes, this game is pretty good looking. The sprites and art all look stellar, however the 3D area of the 60 seconds section is not exactly amazing. Also, computers that are not exactly made for gaming may have a hard time running the 3D section of the game and the best way to avoid that for me at least is to lower the quality and resolution (by a lot), exit to the menu, then set everything back to the highest quality for the text adventure portion. There's also options where you can play just the text adventure portion and start out with randomized supplies/survivors, or play just the 60 second mad grab for supplies. Of course there's a tutorial as well so you can learn the basics but yeah.\n\nOverall, this is a pretty good game if you're into text adventures, resource managers, and games like that. Beware if your computer is not a gaming computer (a non-Alienware laptop or something kind of old) because you might have trouble with the framerate on the 60 seconds section of the game, but the rest of the game runs fine otherwise. If you have the money for it, I suggest you buy it.","May 26, 2015","true","7.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It has some good writing but not enough to make sense. Some of the options for your scenarios don't make sense and the next day aren't explained what happened so I'm just like.. alright.\n\nYour people are then gone for 3 -5 days straight while looting. okay cool I like a challenge but the scenarios then don't match up saying this person just went to a neighbors house?

You start the game in a procedurally generated house and you have only 60 seconds to bring family members, food, water and every potentially useful tool you can to your shelter. Of course you have limited equipment slots, so you have to run there and back again like crazy and decide what is more important - your son, or perhaps a radio that will allow you to listen to army broadcasts and be able to prepare for what is coming.\n\nAfter the time is up, a nuclear bomb explodes and you begin the second, more important, longer part of the game. You have to survive several weeks in your shelter, using what you were able to collect. Every day you have to make difficult choices, like who are you going to feed with your limited resources, who is going to risk exploring the nuclear wasteland in order to find more useful stuff, what piece of equipment to save during an earthquake and so on. Almost everything is randomized, so no two campaigns are the same. It's not as complex, nor engaging as This War of Mine, but the variety of events is large enough to keep you going for several hours. I also like the art style of the game - it's very simplistic, yet fun. Be aware that there is quite a lot of text to read in the second part of the game and that you are going to fail time and again, as the random events can really make a mess of your shelter!","May 25, 2015","true","2.6"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","47","8","17","3","0"

But don’t worry, you’ve prepared, unlike most of the other saps who are about to take a crash course in nuclear fission you had the foresight to install a nuclear bunker under your house!\nYou smile smugly to yourself, all that time playing fallout was well spent after all and in a few seconds you’ll be sitting safely in your cosy vault as the world above you turns into a radioactive wasteland.\n\n\nTick Tock\n\nMoving for the shelter your eyes again drift to the crate of bottled water and an awful realisation washes all traces of smugness away.\nYou might have had the foresight to build a fallout shelter, but you never did get around to filling it with supplies did you?\nCursing your laziness you look desperately around the room, what items are you going to need in your shelter?\nFood, Water, maybe the wife and kids to keep you company?\nThe alarms are still wailing outside, how much warning do they give you?\n60 seconds?\nDashing towards the bottled water you trip over a can of soup, stumble and crash into a chair, if only your house wasn’t in such a mess!\nWhich room are the kids in anyway?\n... tick... tock...\n\n\nPre-Apocalypse\n\nThis is the premise behind the first part “60 Seconds” a unique little survival title developed by Robot Gentleman Studios.\nI say the first part, because “60 Seconds” is split into two very distinct yet connected games.\nThe first part of the game is a quick and frantic “treasure hunt” around your house.\nYou’ll control your character as he runs and stumbles through the various rooms searching for supplies to take down into the bunker.\nYou’re given a few short seconds to explore your surroundings before the sirens blare and the countdown begins, this time is vital to quickly scan around the layout of your house and look for the locations of useful items. (This changes every time you play!)\n\n\nSupermarket Sweep\n\nBefore you’ve had chance to complete your stock take the countdown will begin, it’s time to start grabbing those supplies and dropping them down the hatch into your vault.\nIt’s not as simple as grabbing everything in one go either, you can only carry so much at a time, this leads to a frantic dash through the various rooms with armfuls of tinned food or bottled water.\nThis is 60 seconds of sandbox physics mayhem.\n\nFurniture will go flying, objects will get in your way and you’ll be looking for one thing and get distracted by something else.\nA radio might be useful to keep in touch with the outside world, maybe a good book would help stave off the boredom, there must be a first aid kit somewhere, etc.\nThese are the thoughts that will go through your head as you crash passed tables and fall over chairs in the rush.\nIt’s an ultra intense supermarket sweep and it’s as fun as it is frustrating!\n\n\nTake Shelter\n\nThis is just the beginning, after diving into the bunker yourself, you’ll get to experience vault life and ration out those precious supplies to prolong your existence (and that of your family if you got around to saving them) for as long as possible.\n\nOf course, if you got distracted by something shiny and didn’t make it into the shelter in time then you’ll be dead and need to start a new game, so let’s assume you did make it, because it’s in the shelter that the real fun starts.\n\n\nPost-Apocalypse\n\nThe game changes pace in the shelter and becomes a short tongue in cheek survival adventure.\nYou’ll spend the remainder of the game looking at a static screen of yourself and any rescued family members sitting in the vault along with whatever supplies you managed to scavenge.\n\nEach day this screen will be updated to reflect any changes in your little vault, including the ever dwindling supplies sitting on the shelf behind you.\nYour food and water will almost certainly require rationing if you’re to last until help arrives, keep someone hungry or thirsty for too long though and they’ll get sick and die.\n\nOther items you threw into the shelter could well prove useful too, you see, strange things happen when you’re cooped up in a vault.\nA board game might be enough to stave off madness and a can of bug spray might be handy if you don’t want to share your bunker with some new scuttling friends.\n\n\nDear Diary\n\nLike a post apocalyptic Adrian Mole, you keep a diary in the vault, but there’s more to write about than the dwindling water supplies.\nVault life is more eventful than you might think, random events happen every day and it’s these events that drive the narrative forward.\nEach day you will go through food and water rationing, deciding who (if anyone) gets something to eat or drink that day.You’ll then read through the vault diary,\nit’ll cover the health and moods of your surviving family members and report on any interesting events that occurred that day.\n\n\nKevin Costner or Mad Max?\n\nMutants, bandits, a nice game of scrabble, anything could happen as you wait out the apocalypse and most of these events will require you to make a decision which will impact the narrative as the days progress.\n\nThere’s a banging on the vault door, It could be a post apocalyptic mailman delivering some goodies, or it could just as likely be a gang of bandits fresh from the set of Mad Max, do you answer it? Well that’s up to you.\n\n\nValued in the Vault\n\nThe outcome of many of these events will depend on the salvaged items from the first part of the game.\nIf a radioactive bug bites a family member, you’d better hope you bought a first aid kit with you or the consequences might prove surprising.\n\nYour first play through will give you an idea of the importance of the various items you ignored whilst foraging for cans of soup to bring down into the vault.\nThis game will quickly teach you that no matter how innocuous an item seems, it could well prove useful in the vault.\n\n\nKeep Taking the Tablets\n\n60 Seconds is a refreshing and quirky little game but It definitely feels like a tablet conversion.\nIt’s quick to play and immediately addictive which is great, unfortunately, like most mobile gaming ports, it can feel a little shallow and become repetitive pretty quickly.\nHaving said that, it’s priced to reflect this short term appeal and there is no denying the hours of entertainment you’ll get out of playing it.\n\n60 seconds isn’t looking for a relationship, it’s looking for a fling.\nIts fun whilst it lasts, you’re going to enjoy it but you probably won’t remember it in the morning.\nIt’s the one night stand of post apocalyptic gaming!","June 9, 2015","true","5.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","4","9","2","0"

You dash around a house that you're unfamiliar with while the camera isn't fixed over your character. It sways and swerves, and there's an odd little delay everytime you pick an item up that slows you down a lot. Your family doesn't have the mindfulness to run into the bunker itself, and the bunker has very little stored in it. Most of what you hide with comes from the 60 seconds you're running around to grab stuff. You can't tell your family to grab things either like how in real life, families have emergency plans of what to grab, where to go, who to call, and what to do.\n\nThe game doesn't progress either. Everytime you play is the same as the last, so you can't "bank up" items from previous run throughs as a reward for getting so and so far. This is especially annoying with the random events that can destroy your items. There's no way to flood-proof your bunker, secure the vents, or improve the locks. You will inevitably lose your gas mask, lock, map, flashlight, and other items to random events. You also can't store multiple of these, so there's no way to have a backup plan.\n\nUltimately, the game is just a run of luck, and very repetitive. You occasionally send family members out to grab things, but they sometimes come back hurt. You probably won't have a medpack to help them with either since you already spent it on someone else who got sick while someone was out. There's also no way to recover your members from going crazy. You can prevent it by having more members alive, by having cards and checkers, and by tuning into the radio when you get the chance, but unless you get the chance to talk with crazy members, they'll probably just attack the gas mask, eat rations when they're not supposed to, and run away.\n\nThe same thing goes with family members who are tired and need rest. Can you give them a massage? No. Can you find a heating pad to put on their backs? No. Can you sing them a song or give them a hug or a shoulder to cry on? No. These are all very basic things, but none of them are available.\n\nAlso, the plot gimmicks are fun for the first playthrough, but after that, they're boring. You just read the same lines over and over and over.\n\nThere's no online MP high score list either. This game would be a blast to play with friends like when you go to a casino and sit at a blackjack table together to see who does the best at a given sitting. The game itself is boring, but in a social setting, it has potential.\n\nHonestly, I bought the game on sale for halfprice, and I still believe it's a ripoff.","January 4","false","12.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","1"

Most of the graphics are two dimentional sketches in which beauty will be in the eye of the beholder, but I largely found unimpressive and lacking in variety.  The three dimentional gameplay segment is function, but equally forgettable art wise.  Music also fails to linger after the game is switched off.\n\nThe game is effectively two games in one.  The first being a time management puzzle evocative of the game's title.  The second being a decision driven visual novel.  The two elements don't inherently feel connected, save that your performance in the former slightly enhances your experience of the latter.  The game itself seems to realize this as either segment can be played independent of the other through some of the default options.  For two games, two reviews are in order.\n\nThe time management puzzle is a glorified random number generator.  Tasked with procuring the best and most necessary supplies for your fallout shelter in 60 seconds, the fact that all supplies are randomly scattered throughout the house on each playthrough, while the house's layout is fixed, means that you'll naturally develop an optimal path for maximum stuff accumulation, hoping that the correct stuff is in the correct place.  In short, the segment plays itself for the most part, aside from the infusion of varience in the form of player mistakes.  Controls are slippery and require spamming clicks to force the avatar to execute the desired action, no doubt to raise tension but frustrating nevertheless.\n\nThe visual novel is full of delightful anachronisms that may induce a hee hawing from time to time, but they do repeat themselves frequently.  You'll soon find yourself skipping through the family status updates and consequences of previous decisions to get to the meat and potatoes of your upcoming encounter.  Most of the decisions in the game are focused on rewarding you for having the correct tool when prompted (or inversely punishing you for not having or using said tool).  Some choices rely on your memory of previous encounters or informtion, which deliver a more satisfying sense of accomplishment when overcome and a sense of fair play on the game's part when you fall prey to them.  For the most part though, luck is a large factor, making the exercise less about achieving victory and more about enjoying the story of your family victimized by the ravages of a pulp fiction nuclear holocaust.\n\nYour $10.00s will buy you a few hours of entertainment from this title before it starts collecting virtual dust on your virtual shelf, awaiting the next major content update that may never come.  You can do worse for the money, but you also could do better, and with the release of games like Stardew Valley, I find myself expecting more from my indie titles nowadays.  If the idea of a pulpy, witty game about nuclear war and American values interests you, the Fallout series has been scratching that itch since the 1990s (Those games from the 1990s are likely obtainable at a comparable price tag to this title and absolutely dominate in comparison regarding content).  Consequence driven visual novel lovers can get a more rewarding experience from the Telltale games or a dedicated visual novel game.","April 24","false","3.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Maybe DLC can fix that, I will not come back for this though.\n\nDay 1\nthe alarm goes off and I have 60 seconds to frantically grab everything I can think of and throw it down into the bunker. Sadly, I forgot to think of my son.\n\nDay 5\nWe are all good, there's enough food and water and I'm looking forward to see how far our supplies can take us. Nobody seems to care that we left little Timmy to die in a nuclear strike.\n\nDay 9\nWe are holding up. We eat mushrooms that grow on the shelterwalls, kill giant mutated rats and spiders with our trusty axe and break our radio. Struggles, challenges, curiosity for what will hit us next, nice game so far!\n\nDay 15\nAll we can think about is that broken radio that we could have used every single day otherwise. My daughter turns into a mutant, becomes resistent to radiation and doesn't require anything to drink anymore. Nobody notices.\n\nDay 25\nWe managed to find another radio. Finally we can hear the military instruct citizens to leave playing cards by the bus stop to signal they are around. Sadly we don't have any.  My daughter goes for expeditions as often as possible while I repel frequent bandit attacks with our rifle. My wife went crazy somewhere along the way and left us.\n\n\nDay 40\nThe military regularly instructs citizens to leave playing cards near the bus stop. We ignore the order everytime because we can't find any stupid cards. Food and water is still no problem, we are even stockpiling, but that could have to do with the fact that we are only 2 people and only I myself need to drink at all. Also it was the easy difficulty.\n\nDay 69\nStill no ♥♥♥♥ing cards, still regular bandit attacks that can be defended simply by clicking the rifle and the "next button".\n\nDay 91\nCan't find playing cards. Same ♥♥♥♥ everyday. There are some new things like a dog that showed up a week ago or so and once the vent system broke and had to be fixed, the game isn't COMPLETELY barren of new content but I am bored as ♥♥♥♥ and I decide not to play the game on a harder difficulty again, despite the replayability with different start equipment.\n\nDay 111\nI get an achievement for making it this far. Still no cards and next to no interesting stuff happening. I stop playing.\n\nThe game tries and it's alright-ish, the concept is interesting, but it's not enough. If you like the concept, try This War of Mine instead.\n","July 27, 2015","false","1.6"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","5","12","0","0"

I gave you guys a fair warning. I have a Macbook Pro running OS Yosemite and this game constantly crashes. More than 80% of the time I can't even load the game without it crashing and having to hard-reset the computer to access the desktop, and even when it does load I cannot play any other gameplay modes except the survival mode. If I chose any other game-mode it will most certainly crash. No it is not a problem with my computer as it is fine loading any other game, including ones that are much more resource hungry than this game. I honestly regret buying this game and I want a refund. Due to my very low income, I don't spend any money on luxuries in my life except games on steam, and even then I only try to purchase games that are independent based and try to support the underdog developers and I don't expect the sun and the moon for the money that I spent on the game, but at least I expect to be able to run it. I will not be purchasing any other games from this developer and I highly recommend that no one else does either.","October 1, 2015","false","2.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","1"

One game you might get heaps of food but no water, the next vice versa. It's just a little too random and at times it even appears to strategically screw you over as hard as possible.\n\nApparently clicking on things in the bunker does something!?. I was hoping that when one of my people got injured clicking on flies may help them heal instead of it progressing to sickness but that did not work. I may have been able to trigger the bug spray to medikit event by clicking on one of them but it would take more playthroughs than I am willing to do to confirm.\n\nYou need to get rescued sucessfully in all modes and on all difficulty levels to get all of the achievments. Of over 60 play throughs I was able to get rescued twice on easy.\nEvery playthrough is pretty much the same there are just not enough different events. I hope the free DLC will fix these issues until then this game will sit dormant in my inventory.\n\nAll in all fun for a few hours then frustrating. 2/5 will play again when the dlc comes out.\n\nTips.

The scavenging feature is innovative and fun, but the bulk of the game is frustrating from a UI perspective due to poor presentation of necessary information in relation to the controls you use to make decisions based off of that information.\n\nAlso, the survival part in the bunkers is only superficially explained by the tutorial. Hunger and thirst are sufficiently explained, but tiredness and insanity are left to the player to figure out. You might think that's because it's left as an excercise for the player to figure out, but it's really a case of Guide Dang It because there's little to no feedback tying your actions to results (e.g. Timmy is no longer sick because you did x.)\n\nI gave it 103 minutes. Only 20 of that was fun gameplay past the tutorial. Requested a refund before I was stuck with it. The potential to improve the game is there, but the following need to happen:\nThe page where you decide to ration needs to display the family status right there on the page where you make the decisions. Having to move the journal out of the way to check each family member (or paging back and forth) is just bad UI design.\nEven if you leave it for the player to figure out cause and effect, once the player has figured it out, the game needs to tie cause and effect together. It's too hard to figure out if Timmy is no longer sick/insane because I kept giving him food and water, because of a random event, or just pure RNG.\nI would suggest that the debuffs on family members be given a duration. That would inherently add a layer of strategy to the game. I.e. "Timmy will snap out of it in about x days. Maybe finding him a new card game would help him come around sooner?" If it pleases you, maybe tie getting this information to having certain items in your possession.\nThe game as it stands is only worth about $0.99. At 20 minutes of fun for $10, that's about $0.50/minute. For comparison's sake, Fallout 4 + season pass cost me $100 for 126.5 hours of fun so far. Unless my math is failing me (and that wouldn't be the first time) that's just shy of $0.02/minute. It's not about indie vs. AAA, or the price of the game, it's the value. Also, it's not about graphics. I still play Dwarf Fortress, which, although free, is a bunch of ASCII characters on the screen. I've probably sunk about 300 hours into that game.\n\nYou know, I need to write Tarn Adams and donate - I just realized that even if I donated $100, DF has still provided me superior value to even Fallout 4.","May 15","false","1.7"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.\n2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.\n3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.\n4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed\n5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed.\n6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.","January 2","true","1.9"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","1"

The first part of the game, collecting items and rushing to the shelter in 60 seconds is actually quite compelling.  But after you are in the shelter, things become dull pretty quickly.  The game has very few visualizations and there isn't much to do with your characters other than feed and water them from day to day between missions until your supplies run out or you die from something situationally.\n\nThis formula might work on a mobile game that cost a few dollars, but for almost $10 as of the writing of this review, the price is quite steep.  You can spend that $10 on two or three older AAA titles and squeeze hundreds of hours out of them for the price of one or two hours of entertainment in this game.\n\nSo, in summary, the game is well done for what it is, but given the price and the medium it is little fun for a lot of money.","June 22, 2015","false","1.5"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","30","3","10","0","0"

But that's something that adds to a game. This has hope, but the devs need to fix it up a bit more. 6/10. Saw what was going on, and even though it's a bit mediocre, it still succeeds in achieving it. But just barely.\n\nIn depth:\n\nThere are two main selling points to this game. Both of which the devs are kinda messing up atm... These are:\n1. The scavenge aspect\nand\n2. The survival aspect\nWhere many games only have one of these, this game is unique in that it has you find your own resources in a time limit and then survive off what you grabbed for however long you can/rescue takes. Pretty neat concept, and the humor also adds to it. Would be an appropriately priced game if...\n\n1. The scavenge aspect wasn't so clunky. It is impossible to use arrow key controls, you have to go middle-school Runescape style with the mouse (point and click). Combined that with other slow gameplay such as it taking multiple clicks to pick an item up and really bad camera angles with no way to change them besides moving and hoping it gets less awkward. This is exacerbated by the 60 second timer, since you're trying to rush as quickly as possible. So I just skip this section, it's too clunky right now to be fun.\n2. The more thoughtful side (survival)....was more thoughtful. On the plus side, there's some great work being done by the devs on what makes/breaks events, what is good and bad, how interacting with items helps you. On the negative side, they refuse to say what that is. Apparently clicking the map helps/hurts. They won't say how. Having certain events helps/hurts. They won't say how. You're basically stuck playing chess knowing only how to move the pawns, and anytime you try moving a different piece you get yelled at by the other player. You also don't know if the piece actually moved or not. Have fun :P\nThe second issue with the survival side is you don't really make choices so much as you cross your fingers and hope for the best.  If the military tells you to ditch your gun, you ditch your gun. If they tell you to cut down trees, you cut down trees. You don;t have an axe? Too bad, you will never get past that prompt until you find leprechaun gold on a scavenger trip. There's no "knowable" way to tell your scavenger to look for something specific. There may be a way (like clicking on the map, or where the item is supposed to be) but if there is the devs aren't sharing (aka see issue 1, you have no idea wtf you're doing).  This is also the same for other prompts. For example a gambler comes and wagers two water on a game of cards. You could win and get 2 water, lose and lose 2 water, or just refuse and not win/lose anything. But you can't actively try to increase your water supply, food supply, etc. strategically. If you can, once again, issue 1- the devs aren't sharing. Followed by the fact that your choices can go either way (I've planted a radiation plant that has resulted in both eating 2 cans of food and giving me 4 cans of food with no obvious indicators of how I influenced its growth) it's more like just constantly flipping a coin and calling heads/tails than an actual survival strategy game.\nBesides that it's kinda easy to last a long time. I last around 50 days not trying to conserve, Some people have screenshots of 300-400 days, and one dev commented of surviving 1000+ days.  Really downplays the strategy and relies on the luck.\n\nI say wait for three things to happen with this game:\n1. Clearer tutorial/tips/knowledge. Right now no guides are really reliable, it's all speculative, the devs think this whole "experiment" idea is fun but it's really just more of a reason to not bother playing again and lamenting on the loss of 8 bucks.\n2. Less clunky.  Let them clean up the scavenge mode, and hope it gets more reliable. Till then you'll probably just be miserable trying to play through it.\n3. Price decrease. I think this could be worth it for a 10 dollar game even if just one of the things above happens, and if they worked out all the kinks they could even justify a 15 dollar price tag (and the selling of DLC). But as it stands currently, it's more like a 5 dollar game.","May 30, 2015","false","2.2"," 5 of 16 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","5","16","0","0"

It stops the character from moving forward when a briefcase?! falls down infront of you, and it only gives you 60 seconds to grab all that you want to with a broken "grab" function that allows you to grab something only once every 2 seconds. ITS TOO HARD even on the easy setting. And there is no clear cut way of completing the game at all, I presume the aim of the game is to survive, but no matter how hard I try even out to 70 days I cannot survive.\n\nFirstly. No disaster scenario ever takes into account needing only 60 seconds before a nuclear bomb falls. As a matter of fact the minuteman missles take 15 minutes to reach from Russia to the USA.\n\nSecondly. The game is too difficult especially when a cockroach can end up killing your whole family, This game has never heard of shoes?. And you're only allowed to carry 1 maybe 2 of your family members at any one point in time. Unrealistic, don't they have legs of their own? Why can't you talk to them and get them to run around in a panic collecting resources/the kids?\n\nAnd why is there a second lag between pressing W and the charachter actually beginning to move? Isn't that a little unfair? I mean okay, the guy is pretty fat but this is a video game!\n\nThirdly. No flashlight is that fragile that it couldn't survive an earthquake. No radio is that fragile that it couldn't survive a flood (unrealistic and damages the gameplay). No Map couldn't survive a flood. No book couldn't survive a flood. So why are we being penalized for it? We need those items to survive the game! And you take them away from us based upon an irrational and unrealistic scenario whereby a piece of paper or a piece of electronic gear couldn't be dried out and see if it works.\n\nFinally. The gun explodes every single time that you try and use it, And other times it works perfectly fine for at least 4 shots. Leaving the game far too much up to chance and not strategy. This single act can mean life or death for your family.\n\nThere isn't enough realism and strategy in this game and instead we have lazy programming and lazy story writing based upon the premise that most people aren't smart enough to realize that this game is childish and woefully unrealistic to the point of it being rediculous.\n\nIt feels far too much like a game which exists only to take my money and give me no enjoyable gameplay whatsoever.\n\nUp does not equal down. But in this case my vote does.","July 6, 2015","false","13.1"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","3","12","0","5"

So while I can't recommend this game, neither do I feel the game isn't without merit.\n\nThe key thing to understand about 60 Seconds is that it is a game driven by a random number generator. All events, big or small, are a dice roll in regards to good fortune or bad fortune. Sometimes, you'll survive for months...other times you'll be lucky to last a week.\n\nThe biggest problem with the game is that, regardless of what you do or what supplies you take with you, there's very little you can do to affect the overall outcome of the game. Yes, Bug Spray can be used to make a replacement Medkit, and the Boy Scout Handbook is overall the best item you can take with you, but their value hinges on you getting the events to use those items...preferably before you get one of the fundamentally unfair disaster events, which forces you to choose between three supplies and you can only save one - nevermind how many people are in your shelter at the time.\n\n60 Seconds is a game that has its charm. The art style is excellent, the humor witty, the writing is engaging (Until it grows stale from repeat views). Even the RNG aspect of the game can be engaging, if one is drawn to chance-based gameplay.\n\nIt's just that same RNG can quickly take the charm out of the game. Beyond the Boy Scout Handbook *always* being the best solution to any problem, there's actually very little you can do to influence the course of the game. Indeed, you can have all the pieces needed for rescue available, only to have it snatched from your hands by one of the aforementioned disaster events.\n\n\nTL;DR Version: The game is flawed, but not without its charm. Wait for a sale, and give it a go. Just don't expect to win.","June 8, 2015","false","3.5"," 11 of 29 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","11","29","0","0"

Overly difficult on easiest level. Easy needs to truly be easy so people can learn the game.\n\n2. There's such a large amount of random bad things that happen to you that it's incredibly hard to ever win. Even when you do win, it's pretty much pure luck. It's not a win because you made wise or smart choices.\n\n3. I've posted twice about this but I keep getting pinned in by bandits on pretty much all my games. On or about day 26, on about 90% of my games, I get hit by bandits. From then on they never go away. They will constantly attack my base and will capture anyone that is sent out. Thus as soon as bandits appear, my game is effectively over. I've rode out the bandits as long as 50 days...and they still would not go away.\n\n4. Too much junk in the way when you're trying to gather items for the shelter (in the 60 seconds). I can't tell you how many times I've had a chair/lamp/etc jam me up in a room where it took me like 20 seconds to get it out of the way. It's already hectic enough without silly random items jamming you in a corner you can't get out of.\n\nThat's just a few items off top of my head but the bandits thing is the huge one. It literally happens on 90% of my games. My normal routine in sending out scavengers is as follows:\n\nDay 3: Timmy out as long as gas mask is available. (in truth someone is going out on day 3 no matter what)\n\nDay 12ish: Girl or boy out when radiation is gone.\n\nDay 20ish: Send a random person out to scavenge.\n\nAround day 24-26 i start hearing the bandits and from then on the game is over.\n\nIt's not like im sending people out a lot.","June 10, 2015","false","10.9"," 8 of 23 people (35%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","35","8","23","0","3"

The 60s and nuclear destruction is interesting to me but I got really bored playing this game.\n\nIt starts up with a early 2000 looking 3d house were you try to grab supplies and it is not well executed. It just feels cheap. That only last like 90 seconds and then you get to play a poor text adventure were you mostly do this: Get to send one member of you family to gather supplies (the supplies gathered are random). See to the need of your family and give them either food, drink or first aid. Then have a random event that makes you choose a tool or not for a random outcome. This keeps on going until your characters die or you die from boredom.\n\nIt looks cheap, it bored me and the only way I could recommend it is if it was alot cheaper.\n\nMy recommendation is that you buy 'This war of mine'. That game has some entertainment at least.\n\nEdit: Still can't fatom why people would give this game such high reviews, it's beyond me. Reminder: it's easy to get a steam refund these days if you don't take to long.\nI guess I do not hold it against the developers but what bothers me is that the reviews DO NOT represesent the game and I am not the kind of person that goes out of my way to trash on a game.\nYour input is appreciated","May 27, 2015","false","1.4"," 6 of 19 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","6","19","0","0"

The beginning of the game is just hilarious when you are rushing around smashing into things hurrying to gather as much ♥♥♥♥ as you can in order to survive a nuclear holocaust. Did I mention i ran into the toilet and broke it? Most memorable part of the game is when the daughter got bit by a radioactive spider, turned into a mutant, and then ran out of the shelter (after a few days morphing). That and when I sent Ted out to get supplies and he just never came back. Wonderful way to lose a "survival" game. Surviving to be rescued by the military is very difficult and it is usually up to chance.

Some days you get the carrot and more often than not, you get the radioactive Commie Beating Stick. I love the aesthetics, I love the 1950's scare of nuclear war, the mad dash you need to make to get your family into the shelter, to slowly watch as the bunker drives everyone into the dirt. I love it all as a game, but my biggest draw, and unfortunately this was the thing that made me refund it, was the fact there is so little to do.\n\nThe game looks good, it sounds good and it plays well but it becomes boring just clicking the same menus after each day. I appreciate the craft made to show things both being damaged or used such as a torn gas mask, ripped up map or having Timmy wear a colander and holding a squirrel (if I remember correctly). I just don't recommend buying this for 10 dollars.\n\nMaybe if a few minigames or a few other features were thrown in it'd be a lot more fun. But the mad dash at the beginning is the biggest core component of its gameplay. Sure you can play the tutorial, practice getting supplies & eventually running the full game and seeing where you stand. My longest streak was 40 days and when I played for the first hour, it was a lot of fun but I noticed it was very repetitive. Maybe that's part of the point, and if so, sorry I missed it.\nSending people out is about the second funnest part of the game aside from the overall decision making process. I just wish there was more control over it. More to do. I'd like to pick the place I could go maybe, maybe pick the actions I make or what supplies. The game is very text intensive, and I apprciate that, so I don't see why we couldn't have some more prompts out in the field or handling situations.\n\nI felt bad refunding this game, because I really like the idea but $10.00 for something like this, compared to say a game like LISA, it kind of really draws points against itself for $10.00. If this game had a little more, just some more decisions, maybe a bigger house, maybe a smaller house, maybe just a few more options to really make it your own experience, with maybe a bit more gameplay elements, and I'd have kept it wholeheartedly. I'd like to maybe rename the Wife and Kids and Ted as it were. It'd make me feel more involved.\nI mean I could feel their plight, being stuck somewhere for a long period is no fun. So if I missed the point, again I'm sorry but I feel like this would make a good game to give a kid in his younger ages like maybe 11 to 13 and say "here have some fun with this" and it'd satisfy their desire to make decisions, but for me, it didn't hold my attention long enough combined with the price point.\n\nI'll be honest, I'll pick it up again when it goes on sale probably because I see hope for it. I just wish I didn't have to feel like I wasn't getting my moneys worth.\n\nThe design? Good.\nThe sound?  Satisfying.\nGameplay? Lacking, my biggest point against it.\nI hope this game grows and the people who made it continue to add to it, but as it stands I don't recommend it for the combined price point and lack of overall variety","July 8, 2015","false","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its sort of like a rpg (i think) and sort of like a flash game. a brilliant combination. The humor is wonderful and the art style is well done. the game is also being regularly updated and smoothed out, the developers are really responsive to feedback and really want to fix any bugs that you find. some people say that it is repetative, i don't agree. at the moment the scanerious might be the same but the combinations of events in them are always different, you never know what you will get and in what order you will get it. the first dlc will come out soon so that should be really fun.\n\ni would definatly recomend this game to anyone and everyone. It is in no way an easy game like some people have said and with three different modes and difficulty levals you can always mix it up. 10/10 great game for a great price.

Grabbing what is close by never seemed more vital. It does have charm to it. I love the feeling of it. It is a very fun to do the grabbing things in 60 seconds part. Makes you think about what you would grab. The different play throughs do offer a bit of variety, so each game will not be exactly the same. Yet, there are times you do encounter pretty much the same choices.\n\nI do like the game, and sadly I have to say after playing This War of Mine, and finding the complexity of the story, this game just doesn't add up to the price they charge for it. With only one playthrough, I really hope they add more than just one scenario of apocalypse. Yes, they let you play just survival or just 60 seconds grabbing, but I do feel having different kinds of scenarios would be more fun. Sadly after only about an hour and a half of game play, I have nothing else new to play.\n\nOverall, I can say, if you are looking to get this game, wait until it is on sale. It is definately a charming game, but seeing how others that compete against this type of gameplay, I would say they should add more. Maybe there will be an update to this review.

All these troubles for a bad decision of me. They had everything: water, food, weapons, a radio, a map and even some distractions. The dad went out to find some extra supplies, but he fell straight on a band of thugs. Dolores, the mother, died of deshydratation, leaving Timmy, the little boy, alone in the shelter.\n\n60 Seconds! is a good game, a little and simple one, not a super production of some gigantic company, but it do the job. It's distracting. Sometimes captivating, sometime disappointing. But every event is the result of one of your choices. So you have to be careful, and wise. Possibilities are not infinite currently, but there's a big update incoming, and that game is already a good way to spend your time for thirty minutes/an hour per day.\n\nI'll recommend it. 60 Seconds! is quick and effective, so for a good price, at least less than 1/4 of a current "big" game, I think that you can buy it (at 15$ max) without any concerns. Especially if you like the post-nuke gender, as Fallout or Mad Max universe, and indy games. If you can buy it on sale, it's an even better deal.

Not really my thing, and I got bored of it incredibly quickly, but I can see how people can replay this again and again.\n\nYour house is randomized each time. You get a few seconds of grace to look around, and then the siren goes off. You have 60 seconds to grab as much as you can carry and hunker down in your fallout shelter, and then the game sorta becomes a text-based survival game. Every day, you have to ration food and water to you(And your family if you remembered to bring them along with you), and generally you'll have to face some sort of complication, such as a phone ringing on the surface, the venhilation in your shelter shutting down, or a random band of performers in green tights knocking on your door and asking to perform for you(These are all real examples of what happened to me in the couple of playthroughs I did). Additionally you'll usually be given the option to send someone onto the surface to look for supplies, but this can be a risky prospect because, as you should know, the Wasteland is a dangerous place.\n\nOverall there seem to be a lot of random little disasters that can happen in your shelter, and if you liked games like Oregon Trail, you'll probably enjoy this little gem, too.

Eventually the family dies or gets saved depending largely on how the dice roll more than anything else.\n\nThe game is low-effort as far as development goes. No animations are involved after the first 60 seconds - you just stare at an unmoving image for about 20 minutes at a time. There are little changes here and there that visibly show changes in the characters' statuses as well as what items you have and what shape they're in.\n\nFor the majority of the game you're at the mercy of randomness. Even if you played an event last game it very well could be a different result if you picked a yes or no this time. The only ones that have predictable results are the events that require you to pick and use an item in the shelter - often at the cost of the item.\n\nWould the game be better if there were more active events that went beyond reading RNG event text? I don't know. It stands out as it's own game even if it lacks for excitement or effort. It doesn't strike me personally as very entertaining, but it does have a charm to it.","March 28","true","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Decision making gets repetitive as you come across the same issues at one point or a another. The concept of nuclear fallout decision making survival seems really great, and dont get me wrong it is a great game concept, but the nuclear wasteland experience doesnt fair well in this bare bones survival game. You cant control anyone after the first part where you collect items which takes away from the scavenge for survival aspect. After all you arent scavenging you are sending a family member out to collect some random items and get some disease most likely. Its a fun game and a great concept but has some major flaws and gets repetitive after the first few times you play it.

You're stuck with the stock names. Also, I was kind of bummed they didn't add a cat or dog into it!\n\nI'm still dabbling with the game after a few hours of use. I find it more fun to put myself in impossible scenarios and see how the characters react. I'm not sure the game is worth $15, but it was definitely a very entertaining first hour of game play.

It has a nice comedic feel and the beginning is fairly enjoyable but average at best.\n\nWhere this game primarily thrives in my opinion is the survival stage, in this stage you are meant to make choices and otherwise do whatever it takes to keep you and your family alive.\n\nOverall this game gets a 7/10 from me, although it may be skewed slightly because of my love for the apocalyptic setting.","July 22, 2015","true","18.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Grabbing what is close by never seemed more vital. It does have charm to it. I love the feeling of it. It is a very fun to do the grabbing things in 60 seconds part. Makes you think about what you would grab. The different play throughs do offer a bit of variety, so each game will not be exactly the same. Yet, there are times you do encounter pretty much the same choices.\n\nI do like the game, and sadly I have to say after playing This War of Mine, and finding the complexity of the story, this game just doesn't add up to the price they charge for it. With only one playthrough, I really hope they add more than just one scenario of apocalypse. Yes, they let you play just survival or just 60 seconds grabbing, but I do feel having different kinds of scenarios would be more fun. Sadly after only about an hour and a half of game play, I have nothing else new to play.\n\nOverall, I can say, if you are looking to get this game, wait until it is on sale. It is definately a charming game, but seeing how others that compete against this type of gameplay, I would say they should add more. Maybe there will be an update to this review.

You need to be the kind of person who stubbornly plays games like Don't Starve and keeps hitting the new game button after being brutally killed while cursing the developers.\n\nTrail and error are how you learn the ropes in this game and even then, you aren't	quite sure if you actually have a rope or not because it's hard to tell if you're doing the right thing, or anything at all. I think it's supposed to be like real life, you aren't sure if you're totally destroying your future by asking out a girl from OkCupid, but you're going to hit the next button just to see what happens.\n\nIt may be months before you realize you bombed that date because of your own ego or you may never learn why she stopped calling you back at all. That's pretty much this game. So much of the time you just have no idea what the results of your actions are. For example, you ration food. What happens if you give someone more food then usual? Do they get better stats? Do they go crazy slower? Who knows!\n\nMaking progress is really difficult. In fact, I'm starting to suspect the game purposely sets up hurdles by making the next event unlock through an item you don't have in your shelter or by an item that was just destroyed. The bad things that happen to your survivors don't feel random, but standard. If you have too much gear, it's going to get destroyed, period.\n\nThe dark humor goes with the game pretty well. Your children are really just radioactive conure birds and you need to start thinking of them like that to advance.  Only there aren't a ton of jokes and you'll quickly exhaust the supply of events and keep hitting the next button because you already know what's happening.\n\nThe price may be a bit steep though. I'm hoping the free DLC will fatten up the game like a gerbil with some delicious tomato soup.\n\nFirst Hour of Play","May 28, 2015","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also when you send someone outside you should be able to play as them like for 60 seconds, running around the wasteland, trying to find supplies and there could be groups of bandits and other obsticles.

Decision making gets repetitive as you come across the same issues at one point or a another. The concept of nuclear fallout decision making survival seems really great, and dont get me wrong it is a great game concept, but the nuclear wasteland experience doesnt fair well in this bare bones survival game. You cant control anyone after the first part where you collect items which takes away from the scavenge for survival aspect. After all you arent scavenging you are sending a family member out to collect some random items and get some disease most likely. Its a fun game and a great concept but has some major flaws and gets repetitive after the first few times you play it.

If you don't get into the shelter in time, you immediatly perish. You can choose to leave all of your family or collect all of them. You have 3 family members, including you, Ted. Once 60 seconds are up, you get into the shelter.\n\nYou can choose 3 modes: Little Boy, where you get longer exploration time, a hefty stocked shelter/briefcase, rare problems, and good opportunities, Fat Man, where you get average exploration time, problems, average shelter/briefcase, and decent opportinities. Then, Tsar Bomba: the hardest difficulty where you get no exploration time, no stocked shelter/briefcase, often there are problems, and no good opportunities. This gamemode is for the adept player, and for the most hardest, realistic fallout gameplay.\n\nOnce you are in the shelter, you have until you die or until you get rescued by the government. You can choose to send people out into the barren wasteland (yet full of suprises, good or bad) to scavenge for supplies and food/water. There are also sometimes where you play a game of chance: for example, an empty suitcase appears on your doorstep. There's no one around, and there's no writing on the case. Do you open it? There are a few possibilities: there could be water and food in it (ONLY water and food), it doesn't have anything in it, it could explode and hurt someone, or it could have food/water, but it makes your family sick. See what I mean? It's all about skill, gambling, and achievement.\n\nThis game is EXTREMELY worth the $10 bucks, and has extremely high replay value. All in all, this game has:\n-No story, you make your OWN story\n-Gambling and risks\n-A dog! (you have to earn the dog)\n-Desision-making and strategy\n-Fallout survival\n\nSurvive as much as you can with this amazing strategic game! 9.7/10, needs just a tiny bit more time when collecting supplies.\n\n\n","March 26","true","14.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Review\n60 Seconds! is a action and text-based survival game. You're in charge of overlooking a family in a fallout shelter. You have to keep the family alive long enough for the military or someone else to come and rescue you. But there are many different scenarios in which you can die. Thisis one of my favorite games I've ever played. It's simplicity is just awe-inspiring yet the artwork is great! There are thousands of different paths. The survival aspect is great but the collection mode isn't. It's controls are pretty bad and the graphics are even worse. This is an amazing game but it definitley has some flaws that need to be worked on. Still though, this game is genius, great and simply amazing. It's most definitley worth $10.","September 12, 2015","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Does feel in parts like it could have action but then it still works well as more of a strategy game. I'd say, for example, when sending people on expeditions you slightly wish you could play as the character for a while, but then not being able to kind of relates to the sense of cabin fever the characters gain over time. Also the background song is short and is repeated a lot over a long session, so many times you eventually forget about it but when you do notice it it becomes gradually more and more boring to listen to (less so than no music), so this makes me consider that it was intentional for the developers to try to help players personally feel that sense of boredom and cabin fever to a small extent.\n\nGameplay eventually becomes dull although given the content of the game (i.e how the family becomes mad with boredom) it seems appropriate and its a game I can go back to playing after a while.\n\nControls are slightly awkward, the mouse needs to be clicked slightly to the right of targets and also it feels a bit hard to control Ted during the '60 Seconds!'.\n\nSome parts of the game just bothered me because they didn't fully seem logical. For example if Ted dies but not the others in the family you cannot just carry on playing with the other survivors. This doesn't really fit in with the rest of the game as you aren't exactly playing as Ted (although it could be interpreted as him being the leader of the family and you making decisions on his behalf a lot of the time), save for during the minute at the start. Also the game encourages players to protect each person in the family equally which kind of contradicts that its really about protecting Ted.\n\nOverall, not the most thrilling game ever but interesting strategy, some pretty sharp satire and good quality for a cheap game. Worth the money, and generally pretty fun as strategy games can sometimes be slightly dull just making decisions whereas this has some humour in it as well as the main gameplay. I've probably said more about flaws I found in the game but that's mainly because its easier to point out flaws in something as they seem to stand out more.","July 30, 2015","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Basically there's this nuclear explosion that happens, and you have 60 seconds to gather your family and as much supplies as you can, and then try to survive as long as you can in your bunker until the military rescues you.\n\nAfcourse you also have to send people out to scavenge ocassionaly. Especially when you're low on supplies, there will be different types of events such as bandits trying to raid you, dealing with cockroaches, and animals or creatures trying to steal your food. For that you will need different items to deal with those problems.\n\nAnd that's about it. I rate the game 6.5/10","July 26, 2015","true","30.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All these troubles for a bad decision of me. They had everything: water, food, weapons, a radio, a map and even some distractions. The dad went out to find some extra supplies, but he fell straight on a band of thugs. Dolores, the mother, died of deshydratation, leaving Timmy, the little boy, alone in the shelter.\n\n60 Seconds! is a good game, a little and simple one, not a super production of some gigantic company, but it do the job. It's distracting. Sometimes captivating, sometime disappointing. But every event is the result of one of your choices. So you have to be careful, and wise.

Its because I couldn't get the character around the corner, or around the lamp that fell over.  Because I'm sitting there jamming on the grab button and nothing is happening.\n\nIf the controls got overhauled there or changed to a 2D thing or something, this game would start out a whole lot better.

The bulk of the game is spent on a mostly static image of the bunker where you ration supplies and make choices for random events that occur each day. This is entirely text based. If you loathe random number generators, then pack your bag full of soup cans and run for the hills. The game is briming with humor, however, the jokes will become repetitive as you will likely encounter the same events on each playthrough. If you can look past the clunky initial 3D portion of the game, you might find the choose-your-own-adventure style game amusing the first few playthroughs, but the replay value will likely diminish steeply. Worth buying if the developers optimize the game and the price drops to around $5.","February 11","false","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

She was now crazy.\nI couldn't handle her so I left her alone with my son while I went scavenging.\nBy the time I returned, she broke the radio & drove our son crazy as well.\nRinging phone outside was going to drove me crazy so I sent my son to answer.\nI hoped he'd never return, but he did.\nThen I sent him on a scavenging hunt by himself. He never returned. Thank god.\nNow childless, alone with wife, she drove me insane like she did our only son.\nNow both crazy, me wearing a sock on my hand, we became risk takers.\nWe bonded by attacking old folks & killing bugs.

Basically there's this nuclear explosion that happens, and you have 60 seconds to gather your family and as much supplies as you can, and then try to survive as long as you can in your bunker until the military rescues you.\n\nAfcourse you also have to send people out to scavenge ocassionaly. Especially when you're low on supplies, there will be different types of events such as bandits trying to raid you, dealing with cockroaches, and animals or creatures trying to steal your food. For that you will need different items to deal with those problems.\n\nAnd that's about it. I rate the game 6.5/10","July 26, 2015","true","30.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I walked outt of the room for about 15 minutes and after hearing tons of swearing and yelling, she said she was on day 19 and Ted was ill. I went upstairs and after loads more swearing and many more yells of dismay, I heard "OH MY GOD! TED!" turns out ol' teddy died of disease. After she'd been rescued by the military on the first try with nothing but a bedgraggled Dolores, she said she was gonna get all the family out of there. I asked if she wanted to play again now, and she said, and I quote "good lord no." However, later that night, she said "I kinda wanna play it again. to get all the family out."

If you don't get into the shelter in time, you immediatly perish. You can choose to leave all of your family or collect all of them. You have 3 family members, including you, Ted. Once 60 seconds are up, you get into the shelter.\n\nYou can choose 3 modes: Little Boy, where you get longer exploration time, a hefty stocked shelter/briefcase, rare problems, and good opportunities, Fat Man, where you get average exploration time, problems, average shelter/briefcase, and decent opportinities. Then, Tsar Bomba: the hardest difficulty where you get no exploration time, no stocked shelter/briefcase, often there are problems, and no good opportunities. This gamemode is for the adept player, and for the most hardest, realistic fallout gameplay.\n\nOnce you are in the shelter, you have until you die or until you get rescued by the government. You can choose to send people out into the barren wasteland (yet full of suprises, good or bad) to scavenge for supplies and food/water. There are also sometimes where you play a game of chance: for example, an empty suitcase appears on your doorstep. There's no one around, and there's no writing on the case. Do you open it? There are a few possibilities: there could be water and food in it (ONLY water and food), it doesn't have anything in it, it could explode and hurt someone, or it could have food/water, but it makes your family sick. See what I mean? It's all about skill, gambling, and achievement.\n\nThis game is EXTREMELY worth the $10 bucks, and has extremely high replay value. All in all, this game has:\n-No story, you make your OWN story\n-Gambling and risks\n-A dog! (you have to earn the dog)\n-Desision-making and strategy\n-Fallout survival\n\nSurvive as much as you can with this amazing strategic game! 9.7/10, needs just a tiny bit more time when collecting supplies.\n\n\n","March 26","true","14.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some days you get the carrot and more often than not, you get the radioactive Commie Beating Stick. I love the aesthetics, I love the 1950's scare of nuclear war, the mad dash you need to make to get your family into the shelter, to slowly watch as the bunker drives everyone into the dirt. I love it all as a game, but my biggest draw, and unfortunately this was the thing that made me refund it, was the fact there is so little to do.\n\nThe game looks good, it sounds good and it plays well but it becomes boring just clicking the same menus after each day. I appreciate the craft made to show things both being damaged or used such as a torn gas mask, ripped up map or having Timmy wear a colander and holding a squirrel (if I remember correctly). I just don't recommend buying this for 10 dollars.\n\nMaybe if a few minigames or a few other features were thrown in it'd be a lot more fun. But the mad dash at the beginning is the biggest core component of its gameplay. Sure you can play the tutorial, practice getting supplies & eventually running the full game and seeing where you stand. My longest streak was 40 days and when I played for the first hour, it was a lot of fun but I noticed it was very repetitive. Maybe that's part of the point, and if so, sorry I missed it.\nSending people out is about the second funnest part of the game aside from the overall decision making process. I just wish there was more control over it. More to do. I'd like to pick the place I could go maybe, maybe pick the actions I make or what supplies. The game is very text intensive, and I apprciate that, so I don't see why we couldn't have some more prompts out in the field or handling situations.\n\nI felt bad refunding this game, because I really like the idea but $10.00 for something like this, compared to say a game like LISA, it kind of really draws points against itself for $10.00. If this game had a little more, just some more decisions, maybe a bigger house, maybe a smaller house, maybe just a few more options to really make it your own experience, with maybe a bit more gameplay elements, and I'd have kept it wholeheartedly. I'd like to maybe rename the Wife and Kids and Ted as it were. It'd make me feel more involved.\nI mean I could feel their plight, being stuck somewhere for a long period is no fun. So if I missed the point, again I'm sorry but I feel like this would make a good game to give a kid in his younger ages like maybe 11 to 13 and say "here have some fun with this" and it'd satisfy their desire to make decisions, but for me, it didn't hold my attention long enough combined with the price point.\n\nI'll be honest, I'll pick it up again when it goes on sale probably because I see hope for it. I just wish I didn't have to feel like I wasn't getting my moneys worth.\n\nThe design? Good.\nThe sound?  Satisfying.\nGameplay? Lacking, my biggest point against it.\nI hope this game grows and the people who made it continue to add to it, but as it stands I don't recommend it for the combined price point and lack of overall variety","July 8, 2015","false","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you always end up dieing due to lack of supplies or any other reason, here's a guide to sure survival:\n\n\n1. Always wait five days for feeding. They can only survive without water for that long, and without soup for 7 days. But to keep it easier on your mind, just do both every 5 days.\n\n\n2. just bring dolores with you. It decreases the drain on supplies and you can still win even if ted dies. But ted MUST get to the shelter before the timer runs out for you to actually start the surviving.\n\n\n3. ALWAYS try to get the ammo, bugspray, scout book, med kit, the suitcase, the flashlight (torch) and radio. The ammo helps you with the showering problem (You'll know what it is when you see it). The bugspray helps you repair the med kit, but you need the med kit first for it to be an option. The scout book lets you repair anything that can be broken in the game. The med kit, well, you know why. The suitcase can have good items inside and opens the other three hands in the "scavenging equipment" page. The flaslight help's you get Pancake, which is the dog. You'll  know when Pancake appears when it says something about "Glowing eyes in the dark" and lets you choose one of the following: The bugspray, the gun, or the flashlight in that order with the flashlight at the right of the page. The radio let's you get the military ending, which I got. Don't believe me? check my profile and one of my pictures show military soldiers in the shelter with ted and dolores.\n\n\nI hope this was useful, because this is how I won.","April 13","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Eventually the family dies or gets saved depending largely on how the dice roll more than anything else.\n\nThe game is low-effort as far as development goes. No animations are involved after the first 60 seconds - you just stare at an unmoving image for about 20 minutes at a time. There are little changes here and there that visibly show changes in the characters' statuses as well as what items you have and what shape they're in.\n\nFor the majority of the game you're at the mercy of randomness. Even if you played an event last game it very well could be a different result if you picked a yes or no this time. The only ones that have predictable results are the events that require you to pick and use an item in the shelter - often at the cost of the item.\n\nWould the game be better if there were more active events that went beyond reading RNG event text? I don't know. It stands out as it's own game even if it lacks for excitement or effort. It doesn't strike me personally as very entertaining, but it does have a charm to it.","March 28","true","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you always end up dieing due to lack of supplies or any other reason, here's a guide to sure survival:\n\n\n1. Always wait five days for feeding. They can only survive without water for that long, and without soup for 7 days. But to keep it easier on your mind, just do both every 5 days.\n\n\n2. just bring dolores with you. It decreases the drain on supplies and you can still win even if ted dies. But ted MUST get to the shelter before the timer runs out for you to actually start the surviving.\n\n\n3. ALWAYS try to get the ammo, bugspray, scout book, med kit, the suitcase, the flashlight (torch) and radio. The ammo helps you with the showering problem (You'll know what it is when you see it). The bugspray helps you repair the med kit, but you need the med kit first for it to be an option. The scout book lets you repair anything that can be broken in the game. The med kit, well, you know why. The suitcase can have good items inside and opens the other three hands in the "scavenging equipment" page. The flaslight help's you get Pancake, which is the dog. You'll  know when Pancake appears when it says something about "Glowing eyes in the dark" and lets you choose one of the following: The bugspray, the gun, or the flashlight in that order with the flashlight at the right of the page. The radio let's you get the military ending, which I got. Don't believe me? check my profile and one of my pictures show military soldiers in the shelter with ted and dolores.\n\n\nI hope this was useful, because this is how I won.","April 13","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Damn you Markilplier!!! Seriously though, I have a very love hate relationship with this game which is why I keep playing it. I am a huge fan of the simple forms of entertainment and this game provides hours of randomness and I have yet to be rescued!!! The one time I felt like I had every necessary item and plenty of food and water the whole family went crazy on day 3 with no warning signs?!?! I couldn't go on expeditions until one day Ted was suddenly not crazy anymore, but by that time I had run out of water. The last game, let's just say good things happen when you don't kill the spiders but again, I eventually ran out of water..... water is very important.\n\nBut I love this game!!!! If you must beat every game or get every achievement then you should probably not get this game unless you have many many hours to play it. If the latter is true, get the game, strap in and try to live through the nuclear wastelands.\n\nIf you don't know who Markiplier is..... you aren't a true gamer and shame on you!!!!","April 17","true","14.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KingTophatzz/recommended/368360/","KingTophatzz","Tophatzz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KingTophatzz/","165 products in account","60 Seconds is an enjoyable, quirky little game about surviving after the end of the world. The game is split into two main elements, a pre-apocalypse scramble for supplies and the actual surviving after the bombs have dropped, the scramble does add a lot of tension to the game and players will be forced to prioritize certain supplies such as Water and Food over luxuries like a pack of cards or a magazine, but pretty much every supply can be used in some way whilst surviving and not picking up that pack of cards or can of bug spray may lead to surprising events. The game also has a mode that lets you simply see how long you can survive using a set amount of supplies without the scramble part as well.\n\n\nI personally played this game after watching it being played on Youtube, and found myself drawn to it's choose-your-own adventure style gameplay, perhaps not the best description for the games actual genre, but I feel it's fits.\n\nThe game overall is sometimes based on luck as well, will you find the supplies you need, will someone get sick or need more water than usual, will a mutant cockroach appear and infect someone, you don't know and that can be little annoying at times, but most playthroughs of the game are fast, before you inevitably end up dying or going crazy, which does help to alleviate the frustration factor.\n\nIf you fancy seeing how far you can make it through the game or just find it interesting to look at, I highly recommend playing this game.","April 17","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
