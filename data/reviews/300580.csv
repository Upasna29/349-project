There are basically two environment types and maybe a dozen enemy types that are just reskinned and made bigger as the game goes on.  There's a few different mission types, but they all boil down to: fly into a closed space, destroy or pickup object, get out.  Presumably to give the game longevity with such a relative dearth of content, the developers made it extremely difficult.\n\nAt first I found the challenge to be mainly a product of controls, which are logically laid out, but not something I found natural.  Thruster based movement (like Asteroids) is not as innately intuitive as, say, the direct analog control over movement you get in a twin stick shooter. It's the 2D equivalent of "tank controls" in a 3D game.  Coming to grips with the controls took me quite a while (longer than I'd like to admit), but I did eventually get there and I found it rewarding when I could pull off some cool maneuvers without getting killed.\n\nHowever, once you get to season 4, the game becomes punishing and the increase in difficulty comes largely from the enemies simply having more hit points.  They still have the same basic behaviors as the early game and you still engage with them the same tactics you learned in the first 3 seasons, they just take far longer to kill.  This isn't fun.  My supposedly uber-powerful, one-of-a-kind, experimental mecha-ship feels like it might as well be shooting spit balls and using a wet noodle in place of beam sword.\n\nThe early game has you learning enemy behaviors and strategies for dealing with them which is engaging (to an extent), but the latter game just asks you to execute those same actions ad nauseam with near perfect dexterity.  If you're college age or younger and have all the time in the world to dedicate to a game like this, have at it!  For the rest of us, Galak-Z  asks a lot and I find it gives only small nuggets of fun in return.  I understand why someone would bang their head against a metaphorical wall like Dark Souls, but this game...it's just not worth the effort to get a perfunctory cutscene with Deviant Art quality animation.   For a game that was ostensibly made to attract people old enough to have legitimate nostalgia for the 70's and 80's anime that it pays homage too, it sure doesn't seem like it was made for us.\n\nThe game has great style and I like the presentation despite the low rent pretend anime, but it mostly just makes me want a game with it's style, but having a real storyline and more typical single player progression.  I need a more compelling reason to play than just beating the numbers game the developer throws at me.\n\nApparently many people feel the same despite the positive reviews, because if you look at the achievements, the fall off between those who have completed season 1 and those who have completed season 3 is significant.  At the time of writing, even considering only people who have at least started game and registered as finishing the tutorial, less than 10% of players have gone on to completed even season 3, let alone 4.","November 30, 2015","false","18.6"," 144 of 179 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","144","179","0","14"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Atwalol/recommended/300580/","Atwalol","Atwa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Atwalol/","807 products in account","Despite its simple look Galak-Z is a quite complex game with surprising amounts of depth. It has a lot of things going on, that makes it feel very hectic and exhilirating. And encourages replayability by being very challenging in a way that always manages to feel fair. It wants you to get better and really make use of all its systems to really destroy the enemy. The AI, as the game so promptly promotes, is very good. Enemies don't just run at you like drones. They will retreat when low, lose track of you if you manage to get out of their sight and try to find close allies to help them make your life just a little harder. You also face multiple factions in most levels, and they will actually not only fight you but each other as well. Making strategic use of the enemy of your enemy a very valid proposition.\n\nOther than that, the game has robust physics that coupled with your very nifty grapple arm allows you to throw rocks, explosives or other space junk into enemies. Or alternatively the enemies themselves into spikes and other hazards that litter the environment. Using what is around you to fight is a huge part of the game that allows each fight to feel very different from the previous one, depending on where you are.\n\nThe depth is furthered by you always having two forms available, mech or ship. At the click of a button you can morph in to the other. Both forms have different strengths and ways to play. The mech is all about sword and grappling. It forces you to really use your environments and getting close to your adversaries. While the ship has a laser and missiles to bombard your enemy from afar. What really makes it work is how the different enemy types really make you use them both. You have big enemies that will sweep you aside if you get too close, and smaller faster ships that try to evade you and keep their distance.\n\nThe variation of the enemies and just how strong their AI is, together with the depth of the gameplay, is what truly makes Galak-Z special. The structure is that of a "rogue-lite". You go through what the game calls seasons, which are just a collection of five levels tied together with some story beats. These have set objectives usually but randomly generated layout, which makes the replayability high. If you clear all five them without dying you move to the next season. If you die, its back to the start of the season. (Unless you play on the new lower difficulty in which case you get checkpoints between each of the five levels).\n\nThere are also upgrades for your ship. Different lasers, missiles and attributes for each. Like lasers that bounce off walls, has a large spread or set your enemy on fire. These you can find and equip straight away. Or you can find blueprints that then unlock for you to buy between missions, or when you die or move onto a new season. So there is some persistence in between deaths that don't make unsuccessful runs feel completely pointless.\n\nMy only real gripe is that I don't love some of the 2D art. Specifically the character designs aren't super great. The gameplay visuals are good though, with nice explosions that really make themselves felt. I also feel that the controls take a while getting used to. I played with a controller and it uses almost every button on it. Which is positive, and really speaks for the depth it has but I did die a few times from input errors. When I got used to it, it feels very natural.","October 29, 2015","true","5.7"," 51 of 65 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","51","65","0","1"

If you like challenging arcade space shooters, this may very well provide great entertainment for you.\n\nWhat's great about this game?\n- It has a quick, visceral and really satisfying combat system. You feel empowered, you have a lot of combat options at your disposal, you feel like an ace.\n\n- The game wants you to use environmental hazards as weapons, and lets you pit enemy factions against each other, which is fresh and fun.\n\n- The art, the atmosphere, and the dialogues are truly excellent and really draw you in.\n\nJust on the strength of these characteristics, I had a really good time with the game.\n\n\nHowever, Galak-Z has more than its share of shortcomings.\n- Some parts of the controls are really clunky, to the point of being unusable (at least on keyboard+ mouse). The worst offender is strafing which is relative to your ship's direction. If you are going towards the top of the screen, pressing D will make you strafe right, but if your ship is going towards the bottom, D means left. Good luck keeping track of this in a frantic combat situation where your ship goes round and round all the time trying to hit enemies. I basically finished the game without the use of strafing, which was frustrating and made it much harder than it should have been (yes, I died a lot because I was not able to strafe).\n\n- The game has very little content and is quite repetitive. Every single mission, without exception, is structured identically: spawn in space, go inside the big asteroid, get object X, go back to spawn point. Rinse and repeat. And in terms of content, you have seen everything there is to see in the game after an hour of play. There is also not that much to unlock or to make you want to replay. This created a weird feeling for me because once I finished the game, I really wanted to keep playing because of how fun combat was, but the game gives you very little incentive to do so.\n\n- The game is needlessly punishing. I love hard games, I love skill-based games, but there is a difference between a hard game and a punishing game that takes away your victories from you. For me, the worst in Galak-Z is that if you finish a mission with a couple hits taken, your best strategy is simply to restart the whole thing until you ace it. If you don't, the next missions will be exponentially harder. In other words, it's easy to be 100% dead, but not knowing it yet. This is mainly because the game is super cheap on health drops, contrary to most rogue-likes in which your health goes up and down all the time. And if you purchase health in a shop, it's that much harder to be able to afford those crucial ship upgrades, which creates a downward spiral. This makes anything but a perfect score feel like a loss. Unfortunately, restarting a mission is not a quick affair in Galak-Z: with load time, dialogue time, multiple menu screens and the long build up at the begining of every mission, dying sucks twice more. Another major annoyance is that your upgrade progression is completely wiped every time you reach the end of a stage, without any narrative justification. Just when you start feeling good about your ship and you feel you have achieved something, it is ripped away from you with no remorse. Some may say "yeah, but it's a rogue-like, it's normal", but I don't agree: Galak-Z does not feel like a rogue-like, it rather feels like a progression-based, linear game.\n\nWho is likely NOT to like Galak-Z?- People that expect realistic space physics and combats\n- People that get discouraged by frequent failure and restarts\n- People that hate losing their progression\n\nBottom line:If you don't recognize yourself in the above-mentioned gamer types, and that you  think you'd enjoy a very challenging space shooter with visceral combat and a great atmosphere, Galak-Z may very well provide a good 10-15 hours of solid entertainment to you. Yeah it has big flaws, but the pure fun it provides more than makes up for it.

This is a very good video game.  Most definitely worth the asking price.  If you enjoy 2d space shooting in any way then you need this game, if you enjoy roguelike shooters such as binding of isaac then you need this game.\n\nThe presentation is charming.  Between the art style, the choice of menu graphics, the voice acting that is much better than what you would normally pay vs what they deliver, the solid 60 frames per second, the way it doesn't get in the way of playing the game and yet adds to it.  It's almost as if this game was made by a bunch of nerds that liked playing 2d space shooters on pc?\n\nHave you ever been playing a game and then reached down and turned your sound up because you were enjoying the music so much?  It happens, not all the time.  That will happen in this game.\n\nIt was apparent to me that this game was going to make me earn it.  I ventured well into a level, about 10 minutes of killing enemies and picking things up.  The final part killed me and took me right back to the start.  I wasn't angry at all, the reason I died was totally fair and while difficult to master the controls were adequately explained.  I was  disappointed, but this game is one of those games where you're going to want to do better and I jumped right back in, in other games I'd be irked off by this.  The level was also different the second time around, I appreciate stuff like that.\n\nIn my opinion I've found that there is a tried and true way that a game can be very fun:  Low learning curve, high skill ceiling.  Galak-z combines that with good presentation.  The controls are hard but also allow for lots of freedom, you will be able to develop your playstyle in any way you want, you can play very dynamically.  It's its own game, you're going to have to learn some new tricks to play it, but rest assured that all of it is completely fair.  I enjoy this when it's done well.\n\nDefinitely check out GALAK-Z and pump up the jams.  It's just fun.  You'll have fun if you buy it.","November 8, 2015","true","5.3"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

The punishing ramp up of difficulty (with no way to adjust) is a huge turn off. Losing hard earned upgrades every 'season' feels more like theft, or the designers couldn't figure out how to balance player progression, opting instead to force the player to start their ships over.\n\nThe 'store' mechanic never let me get ahead, as I was constantly underfunded.  It was also possible to finally buy the upgrade I wanted, and have it get yanked away mid level by a random pickup. There is no way to adjust your loadout on the fly, unless you visit the junk dealer within the level itself, which either means fighting forward, or perhaps backtracking.\n\nBy the time I hit season 4, the game felt amazingly repetitive,  for all the talk of their proceedural levels at GDC, i found no evidence, as the same maps and mission objectives came up over and over. Also by the time I hit season 4, the difficulty of the enemies shot up at least 3x. Not by introducing new enemies, but simply taking old ones and doubling shields or health.  Even at the end of season 3, where it started to feel like 'work', and only barely scraping by, this felt like running into a brick wall.\n\nI tried various tactics, such as being sneaky, or using the ships myriad abilities in various ways to no avail.\n\nI can only recommend this game to people who enjoy severe (and again, punishing) difficulty in their games.\n\n","January 2","false","14.1"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

It is supposed to have 5 levels (called "seasons" in game) but only has four.\n\nYou see, instead of making the linear game which was initially announced, 17 Bit decided to jump on the roguelike bandwagon. Then they moved the entire studio to Kyoto, not for any good business reason, but just because the owner is a Japanophile and wanted to live out his boyhood dream of being a game dev in Japan. As a result, 17 Bit lost the only person on the team who actually knew how to program games.\n\nPurchase if you like but understand that you are purchasing an expensive (by indie standards) game with little content or variety, one which is incomplete, and which I honestly believe will never be completed. I was warned away from this game due to the failure of the studio's last project "Skulls of the Shogun", but I was suckered in by the anime aesthetic and a desire for a throwback-style game.\n\nGalak-Z stands as my biggest gaming purchase regret in recent history. I encourage you to not purchase this game.\n\nHighly disappointing. Regarless of whether or not the 5th season comes, this will be the last 17 Bit product I ever waste money on again. Then again, it may be the last 17-Bit product ever as this is their second game ever and the second to bomb.\n\n*UPDATE* 17-Bit has officially announced that in fact will not complete the 5th season as promised. Very poor form. By selling a game, a developer enters into an unspoken contract with the consumer and part of the contract is delivering on promised content. When the dev says "Not worth the time to finish the game, here's a buggy endless mode, be sure to buy our next game!' they have violated said contract.

And a thinking man who's willing to invest time in his or her skills to fly in space.\n\nGame is beautifully made:\n\n1. Graphics are really well made, and the art style is retro but modern at the same time. Ship and character designs are nice homage to other space operas/shows.\n\n2. Sound is well made too. Explosions feel real, thruster sounds feel gripping, especially when you engage your best, and voice acting is top notch. I enjoy the music because it really adds the suspense when I'm sneaking around asteroid belts avoiding enemy patrols.\n\n3. The game's control is very precise, but very difficult and counter-intuitive to learn. There's a definite learning curve to the game, and it's deliberate. Space flight involves three important elements: (1) Flight mastery, (2) proper equipment, and (3) situational awareness. The beauty of the game is that all three gets unlocked with time.\n\nFlight mastery is earned. The controls are very rewarding and precise once you have a sense of how space flight works. You have to account for momentum and inertia, and the fact that jamming your thrusters all the time is a bad idea. Both fighter and mecha modes are very powerful and awesome to use once you earned your flight mastery for both modes.\n\nProper equipment is also part of the game. The game unlocks more and more powerful upgrades as you play through the game, and at 20 hours in, I still have some upgrades left that I have never seen before. There's a hunter/hunted feel in the game until your fighter has been sufficiently upgraded to go toe to toe with capital ships and large group of patrols. Until then, stick to stealth and dodge.\n\nFinally, Situational awareness. Once you have flight mastery and equipment, situational awareness allows you to perform awesome feats of combat and it's a matter of your creativity to paint the explosions in space. The game actually has a lot of environmental hazards that are very dangerous to you, but at the same time, they are equally dangerous to the enemy units as well. I wasn't able to take advantage of these hazards until I was somewhat decent with my control skills and my fighter have been upgraded to survive these hazards.\n\nMy very minor complaints:\n\n1. I always have a slight issue with roguelike games, because it's just too random sometimes. But RNG is RNG.\n\n2. Not being able to take your upgrades to the next season is a bit of a drag. I really want to try out a fully kitted out fighter (with literally EVERY single upgrade installed) can do, as opposed to playing as you go with 5 episodes worth of equipment.\n\n3. Some performance issues on the cutscenes, but it is a known issue that the devs are trying to fix.\n\nFor the price, I think it's definitely something worth purchasing if you want to test your skills in a game.\n\n\n","November 3, 2015","true","31.9"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

I have been watching and waiting for this day and I am not disapointed (besides the lack of controller keybinds). I absolutely love being able to pick and choose my battles, turn enemies against each other, use the environment, and the flight model and combat in general. This game just feels 'right' to me. The map size and spacing of enemies combine with the terrain really well. It flows so nicely that redoing areas does not bother me at all.\n\nPlaying 'Asteroids' at a stand-up cabinet arcade machine when I was young enough to have to use a bar stool to get to the controls is a potent memory from my formative years.

Unfortunately, I found it disappointing to play after a little while. The game expects you to fight really strategically, by leading enemies into traps or hurling them into hazards, but the controls didn't feel good enough to do that very easily. It doesn't seem like it's worth trying to attack as the mech besides that function, since it's only weapon is a close-range beam saber, and you almost never want to be that close.\n\nDog-fighting as the regular ship isn't so great either, since it seems like every enemy is an ace pilot stupidly good at evading your shots. Aside from the bug faction, all enemies have shields like you do (but way higher), so you need to blow through a second health bar that comes back regardless of what you do, and destroying them and not dealing any real damage to an enemy before they recharge is quite frustrating. You have missiles, which always hit, but you don't always find them out on missions, and have to pay to refill them. Hooking an enemy as the mech lets you get in a few swings with the beam saber, but that might not even be enough to puncture their shields before they get loose seems too dangerous to be worth it.\n\nSo overall while I was interested in the game while I heard about it, the ship and the mech both don't feel very fun to pilot, with the latter in particular feeling like you could get pretty much all its advantages from just sticking a tractor beam on the ship mode. I did like the presentation of the game and the voice acting a lot, so it's a shame to see the meat of it didn't live up. From what I've read, though, it seems like the story ends on a cliff-hanger and the conclusion the developers ultimately offered was an endless mode you can't really win at, so it doesn't sound like I'm missing out on very much.","June 4","false","4.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The look and feel of the game lives in  80s, from the style down to the VHS Machine noise and scan lines you get in the pause menu. The game play is fast and intense but also difficult to master, but once you get the hang of it you will feel like a badass as you dodge enemy fire and leap over mechs. The controls are well laid out for the most part but i'd strongly recommend playing this with a controller as i found it a bit difficult to keep track as to where i was pointed with the mouse. As for the story theirs not much of it aside from a few cliches and jokes and you wont find a deep though out story if thats what your after.\n\nYou play as the lone surviving Pilote of the alliance after the empire wiped out your fleet and must protect your mother ship long enough for it to return to safe territory. The game is a rogue like as the game is spread out into a number of campaigns that consist of 5 missions, on Rogue difficulty you must complete each season on a single run without saving. As you play you  acquire weapon and ship upgrades you find or buy it with salvage and just about anything you find can make a difference. Lastly if you do die, crash coins recovered from enemies will give you extra starting funds and if you have enough you can even retry the mission.","May 17","true","16.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Don't believe all of the recent hate (May 2016) for this game, I feel it's just a lot of scumbags from Humble Monthly coming over and bashing on it because they didn't get past The first bunch of missions to unlock most of the cooler features of the game and are now salty.\n\nThe bad: It doesn't provide a good variety of difficulty settings and the game tricks you into thinking there is a fifth and last chapter of the game, although it's just an endless mode. The only way to adjust difficulty is to simply change how often the game saves, which is not a good system. Controls are a tad wonky at first, but you can get used to it rather quickly. The main difference being that the thrust direction is actually dependant on the direction where the player is aiming, unlike most other twin-stick shooters.\n\nThe good: The game plays well, combat is smooth and most of the time you feel like it was your fault when you died. It has a linear story with the easier and less relevant missions randomly picked from a reasonably sized pool of them, so if you die you'll likely get a different one. Lots of different upgrades to change the shooting pattern and customize how and what your ship shoots. All systems are very intuitive and easy to get used to. The game is also nicely stylized.\n\nRating: Since I don't give ratings to games, I would give it 37 polished peanuts out of a suitably sized jar which previously contained said peanuts. Buy it if it's on sale, or if you like strike suit zero and/or twin-stick shooters a lot.","May 21","true","4.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

What can you expect from Galak-Z? Everything from your average shmup bullet-hell to more stealth games and then toss in some beat-em-up elements as well. It's all here and it blends well together.\n\nWhen I first played Galak-Z, it was marketed as a finished game but it wasn't finished, the developers had moved to a new building in Japan and seized all developement on Galak-Z fe a good while. At the time, the game was priced at $19.99 but many who own this game (much like myself) were disappointed that it was missing the last chapter. Recently, 17-bit surprised us all by slashing the price in half permanently and releasing The Void dlc. This makes the game complete, finally.\n\nThe game really makes you feel as if you are participating in an anime cartoon and I don't mean like a visual novel does but I mean like those super cool fighting sequences that you see in the original 1982 Macross series... that's right, I'm talking old-school Japanese anime with crazy transforming mech battles. There's alot of freedom in how you choose to approach the situations and combat in this, you can hide behind walls/rocks/other ships or you can go in guns blazing. It's really up to you as the player to decide if the situation calls for your ship's speed or your mech's acrobatic agility.\n\n\nPros Price has been cut permanently\nAnime-inspired interface, cut-scenes and animations\nTransform from ship to mech and back at any time\n2 completely different fighting styles\nFight Juan Aguacate - the main character from Guacamelee!\nAwesome controls\nOption to play the game as a Rogue-Lite or as a more traditional arcade experience\nFull controller support\nCons  Not true procedural generation as advertized, so not every level is different, the engine just cycles between 3 different paths every time you retry\nWeapons and power-ups are automatically discarded after every chapter without warning\nIt took the developers quite a while to actually do what they said they would originally do - The Void free dlc\nFinal Thoughts:\nYou might be here because you like space combat games, you might be here because you like mechs. Get this game now. At it's regular price, the game is a steal.

Once you master the ability to fluently swap between mech and ship combat in the middle of a dogfight, the controls become interstellar. I was initially taken aback by the lack of controller customization, but I quickly adapted and it's pretty much a non-issue to me.\n\nDogfighting is NOT initially an easy thing to get into. The enemies display a surprising degree of intelligence that will likely catch most casual players off-guard. They dodge your shots, they LEAD their shots. If you really intend on soaring through every single skirmish without a scratch on your ship, you are going to have to EARN it by using every single dirty trick they give to you. That said, being good at dogfighting makes me feel like a badass, and being bad at it made me wanna get good at it.\n\nThere's so many fine little touches here and there in the game.

While I am too easily frustrated for the roguelike difficulty mode, the addition of the arcade mode (which apparently was not available in the initial PS4 release? Don't quote me on that.) makes the experience even more versatile and palatable for a wider range of players.\n\nThe controls provide a challenging but mechanically nuanced learning curve that is really freeing once you get used to it. I feel like the first season's level designs also help walk the player through these mechanics in a way that supports this learning curve.\n\nDefinitely recommended for fans of Saturday morning cartoons and space shooter arcade action.","December 9, 2015","true","4.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you're a casual gamer looking for some action, stay clear. GALAK-Z is punishing at times, though not as punishing as some other games *cough* Dark Souls. There are dozens of excellent upgrades you can add to your ship between/during missions. Thankfully, there are plenty of enemies to destroy; allowing you to get ample salvage points upgrades. The controls take a little getting used to, but it's a great feeling once you get the hang of it. Most of my deaths have not been the result of combat, but the result of pilot error. You'll be thrusting around from enemy to enemy and accidentally ignite a gas pipe, causing damage to both your enemies and yourself. Again, once you get a feel for zero-g, the controls give you a lot of power over your enviroment. Practice makes perfect.\n\nBesides, who doesn't want to grapple an enemy ship and obliterate it using your beam saber?

The story, sound and graphics are good. It's going for an old school style. The gameplay though is Godly. It's so fun to move around, dodge fire and shoot enemies. And being able to turn into a mech is pretty awesome. You can build an entire game around controlling different ships that turn into different robots and it would be fantastic. There's massive potential here for something truly epic. I was actually hoping it would be more like A Link Between Worlds or Order of Ecclesia in space. RPG-like yet more immediate where you can pick up and play for 30 minutes a day and save at a save point whenever you want. A game where you're immersed in it's world with a massive space area to explore or at least one main large space where you can warp to different levels. Where you get to keep your hard earned powerups throughout the game and have to use specific weapons on specific enemies to beat them (Galak-Z Adventure anyone?) Maybe that's too ambitious for the small team at 17-bit. But that would've been utterly amazing. As it is, I still think it's a fun, challenging little game. But I have a few gripes and suggestions.\n\nAlthough the PC version of the game does have arcade mode, the "way the game was meant to be played" is in it's Rogue mode. And that's my main gripe with this. I get where 17-bit is going with this but it's just annoying. Having to sit through hours to finish a season to be able to save your progress and then losing all your stuff if you die or when you start a new season is fairly annoying. Plain and simple. At first it was really annoying. Once you realize what they're going for it's tolerable. But "tolerable" is hardly something to strive for.\n\nThe levels tend to repeat at times and are fairly good for the most part. Not sure if all the time and effort into generating levels was worth it. I read that they hand picked the best procedurally generated levels. Effectively you're just getting the computer to pre-make the levels for you.\n\nThe AI is good. Enemies will anticipate where you go when they attack and dodge your fire. A nice touch. Some enemies are definitely tough, however, sometimes you can take advantage of some enemies getting stuck in tight spaces for easy kills. And some can be killed relatively easily if you reverse boost such that they're right at the edge of the screen as they chase you and just keep shooting until they die.\n\nAnother thing that annoyed me was when, in mech mode, you grapple something, like a box of rockets and then the camera zooms in. What? No, I want to zoom out. I need to see far ahead of me so I don't smash into something or so I can see where to throw the thing. Common sense.\n\nWould be nice and, in fact, I expected to be able to do some kind of combo or something to an enemy after grappling it. Instead the mech just slowly, clunkily bashes away at it until grip is released.\n\nThe top left map is useless. I wish it was just a smaller version of the map view map. I found myself always pressing tab or the touch pad on PS4. Speaking of which I highly recommend adding an option to customize the controls for PS4 and adding in slide left and right to L1 and R1 respectively and make use of L3 and R3 (depress left and right joystick). R3 for thruster I guess. I found myself always using the boost anyways.\nEDIT: Even better -- press R2 slightly to thrust. Press R2 all the way down to boost! In retrospect that seems like a no-brainer.\n\nOh, and a multiplayer mode! That would be great.\n\nThe game as it is is a nice, hard, fun albiet relatively short space romp. But I want to explore the galaxy! The contols are just so good.

Reminds me of the physics and customization of Luftrausers with story, exploration, looting, and complex AI. The movement and combat mechanics all feel really tight and well tuned.\n+Combat encounters always give opportunity for strategy and in-the-moment cool stunts. Even stealth plays a role.\n+Unique and stylish art, solid anime/saturday morning cartoon-esque story.\n+Music is great and ramps up seamlessly depending on what is happening.\n+UI buttons for both Xbox, Keyboard AND Dualshock 4.\n\nCons/Nitpicks:\n-The biggest game design problem I have is mainly that the difficulty curve is backwards. Because you lose all your upgrades at the start of each season, the season starts off difficult and gets progressively easier as you stack more and more abilities and get more and more upgrades. By the end of each season i'm super OP and having a ton of fun. I'd rather see enemies get progressively more difficult than have to lose all of those upgrades over and over again.\n-I'm not really into the character designs. They feel a bit goofy to me.\n-Seemingly no gamepad customization/other profiles. Controller layout is already pretty well thought out, but i'd be interested in trying the right stick for shooting instead of holding a button.\n\nI don't play or like a lot of top down/dual stick style shooters, so my only point of reference is Luftrausers, but if you liked that, you will like this. I recommend playing with a controller personally.","November 2, 2015","true","9.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

While I enjoyed the first chapter, I never did fully grasp the fighter controls but as soon as I gained access to the mech it felt like I had come home. Memories of fast paced, on the edge combat similar to Zone of the Enders or Strike Suite Zero come to mind as soon as I started dashing around the enemies, delivering sword slashes, throwing explosive containers and evading critical blows. From this point on I played almost exclusively as the mech only switching to the fighter to deliver the occasional barrage of missiles. The mech also made the game much easier for me. Throughout the first 4 seasons (season 5 is not available at this point) I found the combat very satisfying and the main reason why I enjoyed the game so much.\n\nNow even though overall I do love this game I also have some criticism. First, as far as I can tell, nowhere on the Steam store page does it say only the first 4 chapters are available when you buy the game. When I reached the 5th and final chapter I was very disappointed as the words 'Coming Soon' displayed on my screen. I think this is actually a bit dishonest. Next, the mission structure is extremely repetitive. The satisfaction of combat will likely carry you through all the missions but unfortunately the look and feel of every mission is essentially the same. There might be different objectives but they all boil down to 'get from point A to point B'. Also, the map design is not very inspiring and even with the level randomization multiple playthroughs feel too familiar.\n\nFinally, I have to thank the developers for adding save points between missions - I may not have bothered to struggle through even the first Season in the punishing Rogue difficulty. The early reviews made it sound like this game might be too difficult for my tastes but the new Arcade mode gave me just the right amount of challenge. Oh, and thanks for native PS4 Dualshock 4 controller support on PC! I hope to see this in more PC games in the future.","November 29, 2015","true","9.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I grew up in middle of Transformers, Voltron etc. so the representation gave me true shivers.\n\nSecondly, the challenging but rewarding controls. It felt genuinely good to learn the tricks and later on outmanuever the enemies, throw them into environment hazards ( or throw the hazards at them), and use the conventional weaponry efficiently.\n\nThird, the roguelike excitement. Guarding your ship armour gets a lot more demanding when there is no automatic full repair waiting every end of the level. Risks must be valued every time to prevent YASD (yet another stupid death). Sometimes the randomness gives you awkward situations with poor weapon upgrades, but I've witnessed how good ability combos give you the false sense of security and you're done.\n\nfourth, very good and tactically versatile action. Slightly directed by the upgrades you obtain, you may take a very aggressive melee stance or the direct opposite, always retreating sharpshooter. All this is backed with aforementioned sharp controls, different attack/defence methods, very flashy graphics and brilliantly customizable main weaponry\n\nOnly thing i don't like in the game is the very generic nature of the missions after the first season. The first season had actual story, so it feels quite odd to be thrown afterwards into very simple pickup/destroy target -missions that don't carry the story anyhow.\n\nLet's just hope the devs get that fifth season released soon :)","November 26, 2015","true","23.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Either way there are a variety of upgrades you can collect for your ship, but these are lost on death and at these seemingly arbitrary 5 mission intervals you are reset to zero. I found the implementation of these aspects both extremely frustrating and unnecessary.\n\nThe missions themselves almost always involve navigating some sort of enclosed environment in space which is filled with enemies and environmental hazards. These are randomised, yet are all executed in exactly the same way and grow predictable quickly.\n\nPersonally I didn't enjoy GALAK-Z at all. I found trying to move and aim at the same time to be a total nightmare, the levels all felt the same and I thought the story matched the aesthetic - a bad children's cartoon.","June 3","false","4.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Gameplay is incredibly fun and responsive, (I used 360 controller, I've read many enjoy the keyboard/mouse controls as well)\n\n2. Rogue-like elements add a balanced difficulty which is "hard but fair"\n\n3. Two difficulty options: arcade and rogue, only difference being when death occurs how far the player is set back (replay mission or have to restart entire mission set aka seasons) This feature adds extra incentive to play the game again, given its brevity this is a great feature.\n\n4. Impressive AI, this certainly adds to the difficulty and thanks to the procedural nature of the game each replay has a different vibe altogether.\n\n5. Variety, goes with point #4 store upgrades/loot are random, if playing rogue gamemode these can really change the dynamic of the game.\n\n6. Beat the game your own way! The complexities of the combat are hard to see until you play for a while (need to get past first season) Combat or lack of combat is your choice, types of combat vary greatly from player to player eg sniping/melee etc. After you get used to your ship/mech you really start to feel like the anime pilots of old which can be a great feeling of nostalgia.\n\n7. You get a Gundam!\n===================\nBugs/Glitches\nSo far I've only noticed two bugs worth noting.\n1. Occasionally a small lag spike occurs usually in combat (this could be my setup however others have reported this stutter) EDIT this bug hasn't happend to me in several hours, this issues was a big one on PS4 but the PC version seems to have fixed this /EDIT\n\n2. In arcade mode Season 2 episode 5- if failed would, upon restarting, get stuck on the loading screen. Exiting game and reloading allowed mission to be played again; however in my experience if failed again the same issue occurred. ****Mine was fixed by verifying the cache.*** EDIT Has been fixed in second Patch /EDIT\n\n***Edit*** 3. "Missiles, Who Needs 'Em?" achievement bugged. Dev replied and will have this fixed by the next patch. This isn't the first achievement for this game to have issues, hopefully they will be ironed out in the second patch. Thankfully achievements don't effect gameplay so I wouldn't let this sway your purchase. 11/3-These have now been fixed.\n===================\nCons\n1. Level design is pretty but the environments get reused quite often. Usually an industrial asteroid, "bio-asteroid", and their respective debris fields are your main areas.\n\n2. Missions, dialogue, "plot" also get repetitive. Each season has 5 episodes, usually episode 1 and 5 have a set plot whereas 2,3,4 are random insert basic mission here situations. The dialogue is well done, however the combat dialogue gets really repetitive. You will hear some lines ten times per episode easily.\n\n3. Brevity of the game, it's not the longest game but as previously stated there is some replay value here, at the very least i'd recommend doing a play-through of each game mode. Depending on the player and circumstance this can easily put you over 10 hours.\n\n4. *This one isn't much of a con for me but it's worth mentioning/also highly subjective to each person* Story/animation is kind of hit and miss for me. The game doesn't take itself seriously and some of the campy dialogue is pretty funny. However as many have said it feels a bit more western than its anime intent. Personally I'm not a big fan, it looks and feels like a very cheap poorly drawn comic book. Thankfully this is one of those games where you don't play it for the story, on the other hand the addition of the Admiral was a welcome one.\n\n5. Season 5 has yet to be released (will be free and hopefully by the end of the year) so its a bit of "hurry up and wait" if you are really having a good time.\n=================\nSome things I'd like to see in no specific order\n\n-Remappable controller inputs (not a large issue as an emulator can be used if needed)\n\n-Ability to sell upgrades at reduced rate for extra scrap.\n\n-Endless or "binge mode", currently after you complete seasons 95% of what you have accumulated disappears, carryover of upgrades/scrap between seasons would be an interesting addition. (a limitation on scrap accumulation would be required as the difficulty would quickly become trivial otherwise) It would also give you yet another reason to do a play-through.\n\n-Extreme hardcore mode, this game certainly is difficult but an even scarier difficulty would add some extra incentive to keep playing a great game. After 20 hours in game the fourth season's difficulty is still very challenging, but the first three seasons don't benefit from this extra difficulty.\n\n-Some kind of leaderboard/multiplayer nod would be interesting. When I think of old school arcade games I always remember seeing the old leaderboards with the initials I'm somewhat surprised that is missing. I always love coop in games however I don't know how much that would contribute to this game as well as greatly increase difficulty of production. That being said I think it would be great fun to play with friends like Raiden Trad back in the old days.\n\n-A stats and general info page, including best run for each season, kills of each faction/specific enemy. Preferred killing method etc etc. Also a more indepth information page on enemy ships and mechs.\n\n-Greater player customization to effect ship/mech aesthetic. Currently if you change the ship's blaster it adds effects like fire/ice/scatter shot etc out of necessity. Mech upgrades/passives changing the appearance would be pretty cool; different colored sword, different boosters, and unlockable mech/ship skins things like that.\n================\nSummary\nI've been excited to get my hands on Galak-Z since I heard about it coming to PS4 and it has certainly been worth the wait. It really brings me back to my youth with an old meets new school approach to gameplay as well as characters, units, and abilities that remind me of 80's anime like Macross/Robotech and especially Mobile Suit Gundam. The gameplay is very well done so much so that it really overshadows almost all of the game's faults. The plot, animation, and in game dialogue are subjective weak points for me, but very easy to overlook as the gameplay is just so exceptional. Finally this game brings me back to a time where I didn't need a competitive multiplayer in every game, nor did I need an open world story that had to last me sixty hours. This game would be a great pickup at any price but if its sub $15 you really owe it to yourself to give this game a shot. Thank you for reading my book, I hope you enjoy the game.","October 31, 2015","true","40.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

From the get go it gets your attention with a GREAT music and an action packed intro. So far this game has so many pros that it out ways the little con it has. It has tight controls, so you can count on that it was your own fault when you died. The maneuvering in this game is just so amazing, It really gives you this feeling of speed and power over your enemy. When it comes to the core game I am in love with that too! I have always been in love with games that were arcadey and hard, mix them together and you got yourself a good mix in my book. The game has a cool option of getting checkpoints every five missions, if you die you lose all your power ups and have to start over.This mode is where you really feel the tension when you only have one health and your shields and you have a lot baddies between you and your sweet sweet health.

Voice acting falls into a nice safe zone where there's nothing making me want to jettison my ears from my head, but nothing to really write home about either.  I'd call it good.

Mind you, I'm speaking in terms of the three main aspects that, for me, constitute a great game:\n\n(1) Randomisation\n(2) Challenge\n(3) Mechanics\n\nGalak-Z excels in each of these categories. Once you become accustomed to the control system, just flying the craft and navigating the enivornments alone is a sheer thrill. But it's more than that. It's about skillfully using the meticulously crafted control system to overcome a very steep challenge, and the satisfaction derived therein. It's about exulting in a stylish, efficient dogfight, and swallowing your own mistakes and learning from them. It's about perfecting your skills as a pilot, learning to pick your fights, and always coming back for more, because it's just that good.\n\nIf pressed, I'd call it a tough, arcade-space-shooter rogue-lite.

When you get used to the controls, just simply moving around is fun. Combat is tense without being frustrating. Because you do keep some progress, dying never feels like you have wasted your time. The game is simply fun enough to make playing it over fun - as opposed to being a chore. Wonderful game, definitely buy it and give it a try.

While you managed to make off with a prototype fighter, everyone else wasn't so lucky. You link up with the last functioning cap ship and her captain in and effort to make it back to earth. There are some plot things in between, but that's the gist.\n\nGalax-Z Is very roguelike. During seasons (5 missions each) The damage your fighter takes is permanent and must be repaired. YOu can spend money on upgrades as well as extra missiles, but salvage is scarce and leads to situations on whether its safe to jump an Imperial patrol or opt to try sneaking past them and risking taking extra damage you'll have to spend resources fixing. There are two difficulty settings, the more masochistic one has you going through all 5 episdoes of the seasons without any deaths. In the case that you do die, you are forced to start over from the beginning. Ther is also a more arcade-y variant, where you can just restart after each stage you died on.\n\nI think the game does a good job of easing you into things, (except the upgrade you get start of season 2) and its incredibly satisfying to cream enemies who would previously kill you endlessly as you improve. The creative enemy AI can lead to some really cool game moments, like Luring one group of enemies into another opposing faction, sparking a three-way slugfest, or using your enviroment against the enemy. All in all I would say it's a definate purchase worth having if you enjoy SHMUPS or Roguelikes. If you happen to be a fan of Stuff like macross, robotech, or gundam, this would be up your alley as well - it has many throwbacks to that genre, in more ways than one.","October 31, 2015","true","12.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Yet another game that would have greatly benefitted from being a twin stick shooter.  Instead, 17-bit eschewed convention and uses a custom control scheme I find awkward and disorienting.  Combat requires three inputs at all times, as you have to use your thrusters (trigger) while orienting your ship (joystick) and firing (A button) at the same time.  Combat devolves into a mess of trying to just make sure your ship isn't plowing into enemies left and right while keeping it oriented at the enemy so you can fire.  It might work with a larger view area, but you are confined to viewing a small area around your ship and often can't avoid large enemies who suddenly appear at speed and ram into you.  It seems the developers recognized this mess and gave you a "Juke" option, which means you can press X to jump out of the 2D plane momentarily  to avoid enemy projectiles.  I think this was a necessary design element after playing the game and realizing the controls are so clunky it would be impossible to win any major battle without it.  I really wanted to like this game, but after dying several times on even the beginning missions because of nothing more than frustrating controls that make it difficult to avoid even smaller enemies, I found myself unable to muster the desire to continue playing.","June 5","false","0.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/UltimaLyca/recommended/300580/","UltimaLyca","Rye Roen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/UltimaLyca/","190 products in account","I received a free copy from the developers.\n\nIf you’d like a full video review, have a look here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uQqbjtx3WA\n\nGalak-Z is an 80’s anime inspired twin-stick shooter? That’s not really an accurate description; it’s got action-y elements, platform-y elements, rogue-like elements… I’ve found it hard to give it a genre. It’s been out on the PS4 for about two months, but it comes to PC on the 29th of October, and it’s pretty good. It has it’s faults; and I think it needs rebalancing, though I know there’s a lot of people who don’t think that, and that’s fine,  but just for me, I felt the extremely punishing nature of the gameplay was just pushing me away. And I’m inclined to believe, as a massive Dark Souls fan, that this is the fault of the game, as opposed to just not falling within my tastes.\n\nIt looks pretty sweet though. The designs feel very 80s-90s anime, which is nice, although I felt the character design didn’t completely reflect that. I liked the design of the characters, but I felt they resembled a more “saturday morning cartoon” western style instead of anime. The anime feel mostly comes from the music, the setting, and, oh yeah, the mechs. I like the environments, I just wish there was a little more variety. The game is split into seasons with 5 episodes, or missions, each. I’m not really sure why they couldn’t have designed a new environment for each season, because that would have worked really well I think. But for the most part, it’s either biological area or mechanical area, and that’s it. It could have been a lot more, with each season having it’s own distinct atmosphere.\n\nThe actual gameplay itself is pretty solid. At first I found it finicky, but once I got the hang of it and began using the environment to fight the enemies I found it a lot more satisfying. It’s certainly difficult, but it’s pretty fair. The thing I had an issue with, was the buffer room you are given. For the most part, if you end up at the most heavily damaged possible; 1 health and, the default, 2 shields, is good enough to make it to the end of the level. However, there are some, relatively rare, enemies that can kill you in one hit, by taking two shields and one health per shot. I don’t think this was a good call; health is insanely valuable in this game, and I feel the point of the gameplay relies on being able to be risky, but still retaining your health. If there are shots that can just take your health no matter what, then I feel it compromises the rest of the experience. And it’s not just that, there are a couple of other minor gameplay annoyances that make the experience pretty frustrating in my opinion; and really make the game ridiculous on rogue mode. When you begin the game you have the choice between rogue and arcade mode, and I would recommend only the most extreme masochists ever play rogue mode. It’s insane to me that arcade mode is a new addition. The upgrading system is weird, because when you are finished with a season you lose all of your upgrades. This is compounded by the fact that game doesn’t have that many upgrades to choose from. It’s pretty lacklustre, and I wouldn’t buy the game expecting an RPG-like skill tree. In general, because of the way the game works, if you're not a masochist of any kind, probably avoid the game.\n\nThe plot, while retaining a lot of that anime feel, isn’t really here to blow your mind. It’s nothing particularly interesting in my opinion, though I don’t feel it was trying to be, necessarily. You start off stranded, and then end up with a super weapon that you can use to overthrow the imperials… or something. I thought the writing was pretty good though, a lot of what the characters say is groan-worthy, but in a charming way. I feel like it really captures a saturday morning cartoon vibe with corny jokes.\n\nThe thing is, I think this game is solid, but I don’t think it’s worth 20 bucks which is the launch price. There’s a 20% discount at launch which makes it $16, even then I’d wait. If you ever see the game for $5, it’s a complete steal, if you see it for 10$ I’d say that’s what it’s worth, $15 is the maximum I’d ever say someone should pay for it (and even then I’d advise them to maybe wait), so $20 is really hard to justify for… maybe 5 or 6 hours if your playing arcade mode? I mean, if you are really excited to play this game based on my review, go for it, but I think for most people it’s smart to hold off.","October 29, 2015","true","22.8"," 31 of 64 people (48%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","48","31","64","2","1"

And thank you for giving us 144hz support.  Plus, that options menu is super-dang-cool.\n\nWhile the story feels underwhelming; the mechanics are the let-down for this gamer.  Controls work well with KB+Mouse most of the time.  However, using a controller things get dicier.\n\nWorse, is the save system.  You aren't even awarded checkpoints.  You must complete the level in order to move forward.  A level can take upwards of 10 minutes, from what little I have played.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MaxBrando/recommended/300580/","MaxBrando","YagamiBrando","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MaxBrando/","62 products in account","After playing it for a bit I, unfortunately, have to give this game a "dislike". This may be a decent game for somebody, but not for me, although I really tried to like the game.\nPresentation, music and characters are okay, nothing special, but not bad anyway. I could get through with that. The problem is the gameplay.\nWhile many reviews say words like "Sharp amazing controls", the controls were not sharp enough for me. The ship is too floaty, strafe option is horrible, and all in all I just don't feel the full control over my ship. Maybe one needs some time to get used to it, but meh, whatever, not comfortable anyway.\nThe next moment is that hard difficulty, constant dying and rouge random generation of the level. Well, some reviews said something like "You will die a lot and restart a lot and you will love it!". Well, I honestly expected something like "Hotline Miami" in terms of that. You start quick, you kill fast, you die fast, you restart. But no, you aren't gonna have that in this game. The levels have element of exploration, you can fly around the mission for a long time, looking for different upgrades and bonuses, and then be killed by some tough robot enemy and then you will have to start over again. Another mission, different from that one. After you die you are given option of "quick retry/reset" or return to main menu. Maybe some of you, my dearest space warriors, think that "Quick restart" button will just restart the level - no, you will return to HQ, where you will have to buy every upgrade again, and then start the mission again, while listening to all story-dialogs again. You call that a quick restart? It's like Game Over screen in Castlevania: Symphony of the night, where after waiting for a long gameover screen you are thrown back at main menu where you have to load your game again. And at least creators of CV didn't claim this as a quick restart. Also, all upgrades you've found during the level will be lost (although I can swear I saw a game tip saying these upgrades are never lost, wtf?) and if you find the upgrade in the same place of the level - it can be another upgrade, not the same. Also, at level 1-5 I was always starting with only 1 hp, wtf is that? why? Is the game too greedy to replenish the health between missions? Is this for the sake of hardcoreness? Stupid. Oh and there is "Rogue" difficulty level, where you are gonna have checkpoints only between seasons. So you'll have to complete all 5 levels without dying. Imagine exploring level 1-5 for long and after obtaining all upgrades die because of floaty controls and some robots ambush. And you will have to play the whole season again, without anything. And the commentary says "The game is supposed to be played at that difficulty". Who is gonna want to explore for upgrades with situation like that? It is just unfair.\nDon't get me wrong, I do not fear difficulty in video games, good fair challenge is cool, and even insane challenge is cool sometimes (hello final boss from Shinobi on PS2), but sometimes it can be a bad thing. In case of Galak-z I think that such a challenge will just affect the game badly. Maybe one should get at least to the middle of the game to see its true glory, yeah I saw that there will be some fun stuff, like transforming into Gundam Megazord etc. but right now I'm dissapointed. (especially after reading so many praising reviews and hoping the game will be a gem)\nP.S. Oh yeah, and after launch the steam tablet at the bottom right glitches and I have graphic artefacts in the bottom right of my screen sometimes. Not a good port, it seems, ladies and gentlemen.\nPERSONAL RATING: 3/10","November 21, 2015","false","2.2"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","0"

Check out my impression in REAL TIME HD 1080p TECHNICOLORS\n\nPros:\n_Looks amazing: The game's asthetics is just hmmm, just excellent in everyway. They aimed for a 70s-80s look and hit it dead on. Great style, great animation, attention to details oozing out of its pores.\n\n_Sounds good: Voice acting is pretty alright, with a nice, clever-at-times-cheesy-otherwise script that is endearing. Sound effect and music are great all around though.\n\n_Great Gameplay: It's an update to the good ol' Asteroid formula, instead of using the the left and right button to turn, you can just use the whole analog stick to aim at the direction you want to face. The results is a game that controls great but retains the sense of weight in a weightless space. The ship is fast and maneuverable, the lasers are accurate and punchy, locking on and releasing a swarm of several missiles onto multiple enemies feels sublime. Great. Tenanaten. Awesome.\n\n_Survival/Rogue-lite Design: The game follows a Rouge-lite design, with procedural generation of level and a tough difficulty. It feels like a survival game at times, since your health doesn't recover between missions, so you have to scrap together enough resources to repair and rearm your ship while being able to affort upgrades as well.\n\nCons:\n_Texture looks murky upclose, but this is fine, since you won't be up close that often.\n_Can be a bit talkative: It doesn't interupt gameplay at all actually. But the characters are in an almost constant conversation with one another. Again, it doesn't interupt gameplay, but does make doing commentary on it rather difficult at times.\n\nOverall, is it worth the $20? Yes! They could've sold this at 30 bucks and I'd still buy it. It's an amazing game all around. Worth a buy in every respect.","October 29, 2015","true","3.5"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

But for children like meself,  whose only language was English / French or both at the time; Robotech was the tv show that got me into the Real Mecha anime genre that Gundam originally started. The story, the characters, the mech designs, the j-pop songs, space tuna (R.I.P), minmei's plum butt as acknowledged by Cmdr. Focker (or was that Lt? whatever, R.I.P chappie) , and deadly pineapple salads (why I hate salads). Then of course, Gundam, I never got the plot when I was a wee kiddie, but there was this one character in it whose name I never could forgot, Saylah Mass, cuz my aunt shared the same awesome first name, Mobile Suit Gundam 0079!!! It was a glorious childhood.\n\nIt wasn't until I made it to college that the journey really began, and Gundam, Macross, Yamato, FMP and a lot other series got my attention.\n\nNuff about the pastly past, onto the present.\n\nAdulthood is super awesoeme. As mech games became somewhat popular with the advent of indie development, and of course, the games readily available on the Japanese market (GvG: Extreme Versus, and games released by Artdink or From Software).\n\nGalak-Z is an homage to the past two decades of mech animes. The developers clearly are fans of Japanese mech animes, and have somewhat created a game that's akin to the episodic nature of the shows we grew up with. The story is pretty much Yamato / Macross at this point. Your battleship is far away from earth, and is traveling back through enemy territory. You are an awesome pilot, A-Tak, who also happens to be the last surviving pilot, flying the last transformable "variable fighter" available on your "science" vessel helmed by a lady commander named ... Beam. A-Tak and Beam then meets Crash, the salvage dealer/merchant, and the journey begins.\n\nThe Game\nThe game is set around 5 episodes, essentially chapters, whereby A-Tak has to undertake about 5 missions per chapter before facing off a big baddie ... from evil space wurm to evil alien superpilot. Each mission are randomly generated whereby A-Tak has to go on salvage runs or destroy enemy equipments to allow your ship to continue it's journey onward to Earth. If you die, it's game-over, but you can start over at the beginning of each episode with a stack of crash (the merchant) coins earned in-game,  which allow you to purchase a few random upgrades for your ship when you begin anew.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay is unique, and physics-based as you have to balance between using your propulsion system in a Zero-G environment to navigate asteroids field and derelict space crafts or enemy installations to carry our your jub! A-Tak's piloting skills is very dependent on the player ability to use the in-game flight system to avoid incoming pewpewpew, sssshboomsticks, and dangerous space flora that take away your shield among other things (traps). Lose a health bar and it's permanent. You can either recover it by spending cash to buy +1 HP, or you may receive a temporary HP bonus in-game. And there's the mech ... which changes how you play the game. Equipped with a plasma sword and a shield, you can charge in recklessly for the kill, or grab enemies from afar and hold them as a shield or attack them while trapped in your death grip!\nThere's a also a stealth mechanics, but I came here for the pewpew.\n\nSomething about the baddies\nThe enemy varities are varied between weak scout units, to enemy fighter plane, mechs and I guess, corvettes and later on mini-battleships.\nEach faction encountered are somewhat very different, raiders have better shielding systems while the antagonistic imperial alien race, have more pewpewpew. And there are space bugs who go squished and often leaves A-Tak to spend his free time cleaning his little fighter.\n\nMusic and other stuff\nThe music and game atmosphere is very soothing, and the voice acting is spot-on. Between corny and adorable. I love A-Tak interaction with the crew.\n\nVerdict\nYou read all of that junk?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jarent/recommended/300580/","jarent","Zed","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jarent/","130 products in account","Uber true review for GALAK-Z:\n\nIt has 4 seasons atm, which are like chapters. Season 5 is coming soon.\n\nStory is a little bit above average. Most of the story is told via dialogs. Game lacks in interactions between characters during some missions, which kind of disrupts the atmosphere, but key missions usually make up for that. Also characters often comment on stuff that is happening on screen, which works as a nice filler.\n\nGameplay: aircraft controls are interesting and pretty complex for a new player, which ups the skill ceiling. I played thru 4 seasons and still am a mediocre pilot. A lot of room 4 perfection is very good, otherwise you learn the game too quickly and get bored.\n\nAI is as good as it can be, which is not very smart, but it gets the job done. There is a sufficient amount of enemy types for 5 seasons I'd say.

Now add a vibrant universe full of stuff with which you can directly interact, very well acted voices, an anime style overflowing of garish colors everywhere beautifully mixed, perfectly blended 2D and 3D figures and backgrounds, a funny script and above all missions that will equally require from you to be the ace the game expect in order to  toast your foes with your ever upgrading lasers as to *think* what will be your next action should you won't create new space debris out of yourself...\nI feel really lucky I stumbled upon this absolute instant CLASSIC. When you have been playing computer games since the 8-bits era and think you have seen everything it's very refreshing to find a jewel like GALAK-Z.\nThis game is full of clichés in a good sense, with an extra twist and a wink or two on every twist; if you're looking for a cool die-hard arcade shooter stop reading this review and go grab a copy.\nWait, did I mention the awesome music and sound effects that will be accompanying you through your journey? Didn't I mention the beautiful ocarina that plays at certain moments of the game (that reminds me to Cpt. Harlock, not to mention your capital ship that acts as your home)?\nAs I said it above, and I believe I was quite clear then, stop reading my review and go grab a copy - you can thank me later.","November 2, 2015","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Season 5 is coming soon.\n\nStory is a little bit above average. Most of the story is told via dialogs. Game lacks in interactions between characters during some missions, which kind of disrupts the atmosphere, but key missions usually make up for that. Also characters often comment on stuff that is happening on screen, which works as a nice filler.\n\nGameplay: aircraft controls are interesting and pretty complex for a new player, which ups the skill ceiling. I played thru 4 seasons and still am a mediocre pilot. A lot of room 4 perfection is very good, otherwise you learn the game too quickly and get bored.\n\nAI is as good as it can be, which is not very smart, but it gets the job done. There is a sufficient amount of enemy types for 5 seasons I'd say. Enemy groups often consist of different ships and it forces you to change your tactics.\n\nInterface is good, game didn't confuse me at any point, I especially liked that controls are always shown on screen. The only problem is an uncontrollable camera. It often moves towards the closest enemy, but sometimes this  feature doesn't work. Played at 1280x720.\n\nDifficulty ceiling should be a little higher imo, because I played 4 seasons thru on Rogue without dying once. I was pretty close to dying, but considering how new I am to the controls, I should've died at least once? Still, I think I'm a minority here.\n\nGame is good but not best (jw best).","December 31, 2015","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Having bought the game as a full release and not Early Access version, I feel ripped of by the devs and change my review to negative. I do not support such a company practice and recommend not to buy products buy such companies! Unfortunately, I bought the game on release, so there's no option to get a refund anymore. It's a pity that such a good game concept has no final chapter!\n\n\n---------------- First Review from October 2015 -------------------------\n\nHaving followed the game's development over 4 months and being happy to play it, now that it's release day, I feel obliged to inform you that this game is awesome so far!\nOf course, I will update this first-sight review (have played the first 4 missions) sometime, this should be an orientation for interested players.\n\nIn it's current state the game offers:\n\n1. Smooth gameplay with orientation towards classic shootemup playstyle with a modern twist.\n2. I haven't unlocked many of the ship's functions yet, but the game seems to offer alot of dogfight variety and customisations.\n3. The design of the game is nice. With elements of oldschool space shooters like R-Type, Gradius and perhaps a bit of colour of Pop'n Twinbee, it is put in the mix with Manga character design spiced with alot of references to the artstyle of series like Transformers or Saber Rider.\n4. I smell a challenging difficulty even for roguelike fans like me. The curve increases alot if when enter the last missions of season 1. Evasion and tactical fighting will become important that's for sure.\n5. Full gamepad support\n\nWhat the game lacks:\n\n1. The two main protagonists lack depth and story, dialogues feel bland somehow. Still, the cutscenes are just a very small part of the game so this is just a small malus.\n2. The sountrack and synchro could need some work, but it somehow fits the protagonists mentioned above. ;)\n3. Not many possibilities to adjust the game in settings. Take it as it is.\n\nRemember, these are just first thoughts about a game I'll probably love when I advance more, so this should be taken with a grain of salt.\nI would rate it a very optimistic 8/10 so far. For fans of the roguelike SciFi genre, I can definitely recommend buying this product.\n\n[EDIT ABOVE!]","October 29, 2015","false","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
