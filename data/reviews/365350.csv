One day, she discovers she has turned into a luccretia as a half-human and half-cat creature. Amidst a backdrop of general dislike of luccretias by the local human population, this visual novel feature Lilia turning between a human and luccretia as Leea and her interactions with her childhood friend and eventual boyfriend Ronan, her grandmother, a frequent visitor at her grandmother's bakery Juli, Ronan's friend and superior Mars, an unnamed ELM member and a mysterious black cat over six chapters.\n\nThe game has plenty of save slots to allow different gameplay and dialogue choices to be made during the game, with a small popup icon of Lilia/Leea to reach a slightly different storyline branch or a love icon to reach a secret unlockable scene in each chapter, a chapter summary at the end of each chapter and the option to skip and fast-forward any part of the game.\n\nThe story and plot is written like a romantic comedy and has its share of humour and two nice happy endings.\n\nThe soundtracks and overall game presentation are great, it would have been nice if the theme song DLC contain any bonus soundtrack not in the game in addition to the theme song and lyric book.

Rather silly, even the "serious" aspects of it.\nDialogues? A lot of overreactions and screaming, which may be explained by the anime style of the whole game. Understandable and I'm sure there are people who find it cute, but for me it was hard to stand, not to mention feel any connection to the characters whatsoever.\nWriting? Isn't bad, but let's be honest here - any visual novel that has character's actions described by "*annoyed*, *sweat*, *mad*", is just doing it wrong.\nConcept? Interesting. I liked the idea that different choices lead us closer to one or the other side of our character.\nProtagonist? Annoying. In both versions. Though I'm sure some people will find her cute or at least bearable.\nRomance? Eh... I didn't really feel any chemistry between protagonist and Ronan and he is, sadly, the only one romantic option, despite being, in my opinion, the least interesting of all male characters.\n\nIf you'll have a chance to buy it as a part of bundle or during sale, you may try it. If not, I can't recommend it, it's not worth the full price - not in terms of plot, length, nor complexity.","January 9","false","5.2"," 24 of 33 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","24","33","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/callistawhite/recommended/365350/","callistawhite","CallistaWhite","http://steamcommunity.com/id/callistawhite/","137 products in account","How to Take Off Your Mask is a visual novel game developed by the same people who made dUpLicity, Cafe 0, and the East Tower series.  This game has elements of fantasy, humor, and cuteness and without a doubt, I think this is the developer's best game ever.  ^^\n\nHTTOYM tells the story of a girl named Lilia who works in her grandmother's bakery and has a childhood friend named Ronan.  She seemingly leads a normal life until one day, she turns into a luccretia, a half-human, half-cat being.  Suddenly, her life changes and well, I won't say anymore since that would clearly be spoiling the story.  ;)\n\nSo on to the review itself.  First off, I loved the story.  Although most of it is told from Lilia's point of view, there are times we can see it from Ronan's point of view.  It depends on how strong Lilia's relationship with Ronan is and whether she views things from a human's or luccretia's point of view.  There are indicators that can help determine what effects the choices you make have.  Although there are only two paths (basically whether Lilia takes on the human or luccretia point of view), I enjoyed playing both of them, especially the luccretia point of view.  I thought that the writing was excellent and even the grammatical errors were minor.\n\nThe art was great as well as the music so really, I can't think of a single complaint to make.  I loved Lilia's character and the relationship between her and Ronan and how it changed through the story.  Also, I liked the teaser that's unlocked after you complete both paths, as it gives promise to a sequel.  I would love for there to be a sequel to HTTOYM, as I found myself immersed in the story and would love to learn more, especially about who is behind wanting all of the luccretias exiled.\n\nI'd recommend getting this game for anyone who is a fan of VNs although I'll admit that if you want one where the MC can date multiple guys, I'm sorry to disappoint but that isn't the case here.  Still, I think it's worth getting, especially if you want to enjoy a cute, light-hearted story.  ^^","January 19","true","12.2"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","15","17","0","2"

Story is very adorable and cute, scenario focuses on the dilemmas and transformation which the protagonists undergo under the influence our decisions. You can say that game is simple because it has only two routes and one guy to romance, but it has a few nice twists and choices.

I must say, this game is very adorable! I highly recommend this game if you are a fan of visual novels.\n\nPros:\n*Character sprites are VERY well done. The shading and proportions are excellent, and don't make me feel like I'm looking at a newgrounds flash game made by a 14 year old.\n*Very well written story. Dialogue is well done, the chraracters, while not very in depth, I feel are quite decently written.\n*Gameplay does not appear to have any bugs at all\n*This game does appear to have some replay value\n*This game is fully voiced, even the minor characters (all two of them). Voices are in Japanese.\n\nCons:\n*This game is rather short (I am a huge speed reader, so actual gameplay was less than an hour for me. Then again, I can read a 600 page book in two hours). If you are a slower reader, I imagine this would take a bit longer.\n*The story, while well written, could use a bit of fleshing out. I guess I just like more details and meat to a story.\n*Price does feel a bit high to me. Then again, this is probably because of the voice acting.\n*Plotline seems to skip around a bit, but given this is a light-hearted story, it doesn't really detract from anything.\n\n\nAll in all, if you love visual novels and reading, this is a good game. If you are a huge otome and VN fan like me, you won't mind the price. Otherwise, you may want to wait until this goes on sale.","July 14, 2015","true","6.3"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","9","11","2","0"

K.","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197973230221/","3588 products in account","Who in the world is not wearing a mask? Some would say yes and thats only because the mask is so good, that they can even belie theirself. Only a few people in the world are not actors, can be themself. It need many courage to get it off, show the real character / thinking and hope to be accepted with the strenghts and weaknesses, but the most never can overjump their shadows and tell what they want. They have never the strength to be real free. So this game is about 5 persons that all hide secrets and take of their mask to trust one bye one. The story is not so good like the 2 games before from same developer, but its still a very good story with lovely characters and even if its feels they spin round by round on the same place a bit. So even if the suprising is missing this tale is interesting to get to the end and know what happen, what Juli and big brother plans, could they be the bad guys and help to trap her? Maybe, maybe not. So i am happy as i saw the 2 story parts, even if they are at the start the same (Bonus are different) and get at later chapters  a bit splitted and see the 2 endings and the secret discussion. I hope it get a 2nd part in future.\n\nSo for all VN Fans i can say, show trailer and get it with a discount and support this friendly low budget developer for more good ideas. I give this game personal 87 %. It could have a bit more parts, maybe about some history of people like Juli/ Grandmother/ Mars a bit, but its fine. So think about how muchthis work is for you worth for some hours and think how many months a developer need to work on a game. Thank you for reading. I hope you enjoy your purchase.","January 3","true","4.4"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","13","19","0","2"

I'm a slow reader and do each storyline at a different time to re-experience it, rather than do it once and skip skip skip to just catch the differences right away. Either way there are still enought differences to give you good story. Choices can lead to a human ending and a kitty ending where the last few chapters have a bit of a different storyline to get to similar ending that is a cliff hanger.\n\nThey might have a sequel come out (certainly set up for it) as you get there feeling there's a lot of storyline around the two main characters that you only catch glimpses of.

With that said, in terms of gameplay, there is a bit lacking. There are only two routes to take, and I found that my choices did not have a significant impact in which route I took, but that might just be me. How to Take Off Your Mask makes up for this shortcoming with bonus scenes, which are, although short, a welcome addition. All in all, I did like the story a lot, but wish that there are options to romance other characters than the main one (no names cause, spoilers!). For those achievement hunters out there, such as myself, I found How to Take Off Your Mask a fairly easy 100%, even with 27 achievements. A price of 14.99 is a bit much to ask for for the game as it is now, so I would recommend waiting for a sale and paying around 9.99, give or take a dollar. To sum it up, How to Take Off Your Mask has great visuals, a good soundtrack, and a good story.\n8.5/10","January 3","true","4.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The game tells the story of Lilia (can be changed), a girl who misteriously turns into a cat (luccretia) one day. She struggles to accept her new form while others in the city want the luccretias exiled or worse. Added to this is her childhood friend, Ronan, who might be keeping a secret  from her.\n\nI found the story very cute, including Lilia's luccretia side. I feel like I can relate with the aspect of keeping a side of yourself secret from others. Ronan was absolutely adorable, but also manly and intriguing enough. He's one of my favorite type of characters in otome games. This game only has one romanceable character so if you're into romancing a bunch of guys, it might not be your type of game. For me, I'm okay with it because I always feel odd going for other guys in otome games. I usually have a favorite anyway, so some other guys might feel like a chore (it happened with Amnesia).  Anyway, the romance and story were very cute and lovely. It's a refreshing type of game. It's a bit on the short side though, I feel like it could be finished in one go. It took me a while because I spaced out my playing, plus I left the game idle for a long time today so that's why it says I've played so many hours. I have no problem with the length of the story, but I know others might so I just felt like pointing that out. The art is amazing though, I loved it. Also, the voice acting was high quality as well. This game has really good production value!\n\nSome of the things that bothered me were related to the story itself. I felt like a couple of things were left unresolved and I'm not sure if this game will have a sequel, so I'm left wonderings about those things. I'm the kind of person who loves closure on her stories. These are the things that I felt were left unresolved:\n\n\nLilia's parents are still gone. I'm left wondering so many things. Are they still alive? If they are, why is it taking so long for them to come back. Are the luccretias not happy with the human kingdom either? Don't they want to have peace? Also, did they have other children while away? Does Lilia have siblings? I know it's random, but they've been gone for so long! I need answers. If they're not alive, what happened to them? I just really need answers.\nWho was the bad guy? Throughout the game, Juli and Mars made it seem like it was someone they knew, someone powerful, but they never showed the bad guy. I was underwhelmed by this, as I was expecting a big reveal.\nMore on Laarz, the Luccretia kingdom. It was mentioned like twice in the game but we don't know much about it. At the end of the secret discussion, Juli decides he'll go there to investigate. I wish we could have seen that. Maybe even see everything be resolved fully.\nJuli's royal family God power. We barely had a mention on it. He used it on Lilia in both routes, but we barely got an explanation of it. I wanted to know what he was capable of with those powers, since Mars made it seem as if it was dangerous.\n\nI know the game is focused more on romance, but I feel that if you have these elements to a story, it's good to conclude everything clearly.\n\nOther than that, this was a very lovely otome game and I recommend it to otome fans!","January 4","true","7.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's ridiculously cute and a fun premise for a story. It's only got one romancable character, but I didn't feel like that took away from the story at all. (Although, I would have loved a route for Big Bro! ;) hehe) I enjoyed the soundtrack and loved the voice acting.\n\nMy biggest problem is that there are so many unanswered questions at the end of the game, especially after you unlock the "Secret Discussion." There are a lot of things going on, not just this love story between the MC & her childhood friend, but none of them get resolved.\n\nI'm actually really hoping that since this is a relatively new game, there'll be a sequel. I'm not holding my breath, but I'd definitely want to find out the answers to the all those loose ends left dangling.\n\nAll that said, I absolutely recommend the game if you're looking for a cute way to spend a few hours. I'd wait for a sale for the game because there are only 2 unique routes and $15 for a only few hours of gameplay is a lot. :\","January 2","true","6.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not sure how to get the side stories, but I'm not to concern on it.\n\nWish that there would have be more than two paths in the game, but still a pretty good story.\n\nPersonally, I'm still curious on how the girl's parents are doing, even though you learn what they were doing.\n\nCome to think of it, I'm curious about that strange cat with two different eye colors in the beginning, it only appeared once and there is zero explantion on who she is.\n\nMaybe someday there could be a sequel to this game and learn more about the world and to expand of some of the plot points...","October 7, 2015","true","2.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As humans fear almost anything they can't control and have full comprehension about, most habitants of Leezera nurtures hate towards the Luccretias.\n\nOne day, Lillia, our protagonist, discovers that she's a Luccretia. How will her life be affected by that sudden discover? Will her relationship with Ronan, her beloved childhood friend, change? Will humans and Luccretias be able to co-exist pacifically in the future?\n\nThe game itself is pretty short and has two different patchs, who lead to two different endings. Sadly, the game focus too much into Lillia/Ronan relationship (they're a very cute couple indeed) and often forget the rest of the characters and the story itself. The developers left a lot of gaps in the story opened to be filled by a sequel, that I'll definitely play.\n\nTL;DR: This game is a short but enjoyable experience and it needs a sequel.","April 20","true","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm not sure this game is worth the $14.99. The originality in the demo was lost to the banality of the following chapters in the story. If you haven't been exposed to much romantic themed stories, you may think this story is original, which is fine, then this game is for you. But if you're looking for an otome game that breaks the mold, this isn't the game for you.","March 21","false","0.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
