Despite being clearly inspired by Higurashi When They Cry, the intriguing story, imaginative ideas and gorgeous artwork make up for a somewhat shaky translation.\n\nThe story opens with Yuhito Asakawa trapped in a dream-like world filled with death and horror.  He discovers his childhood sweetheart amidst the mayhem and attempts to escape together, only to end up lost and alone before he awakens from what was only a nightmare.  He soon realizes that the nightmare may not have ended as young, mutilated girls begin appearing throughout town.  Determined to catch the murderer, his pursuit will lead him on a nightmarish journey that will change his understanding of the peaceful world he's always known.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=460089412\nWhat started off as a fairly generic slasher tale ends up a lot more complex and involved than I was expecting.  Everything experienced early on is turned on its head as details and explanations emerge.  Plenty of clues are there, but without knowledge of the inner workings of this world it's hard to guess at the ultimate outcome.   This isn't a bad thing; far too often I figure out these stories well before they've ended.  But too many curveballs lead to a sense of incredulity when improbable plot developments seem to come out of nowhere, not to mention the liberal use of deus ex machina to conveniently move the narrative forward when the story has written itself into a corner.\n\nThat said, there are plenty of interesting ideas explored here, and the horror elements are visceral and terrifying.  Many of the bad endings have the protagonist in creatively horrific situations that will make your skin crawl.  The mythos is also imaginatively conceived and leaves the door open for more stories in this interesting universe.  My biggest disappointment, however, are in a few intriguing story elements that were hinted at but never returned to.  In some ways, these ideas were more interesting to me than the overall narrative.  Ending the game without exploring them left me feeling  shortchanged, like I was missing an important story point that explained away some of the plot holes that were never addressed (Why was Rika so strong? How did the cave keep Nanami alive?).\n\nThings start off slow, however.  There's enough horror and mystery to hook you early on, but the plot takes its time to draw you in.  It often feels like Yuhito is wandering between random, unrelated events with little clue on how to piece them all together.  It wasn't until Chapter 6 (out of 11) when a back story begins to materialize that I became fully engrossed.  And let me tell you, once some of those revelations hit, you won't be able to pull yourself away.  But the challenge is getting to that point.  I blame part of the slow burn on a shaky translation that fails to engage the reader with more descriptive writing.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=473275148\nFor the most part, the dialogue and narration is acceptable: everything is clearly understandable without any glaring grammatical errors.  However, I feel the translation likely followed the literal meaning of the original language too closely as the style can be stilted and plain.  While the graphic depictions of gore and violence were extremely vivid and creative, the bland dialogue often left me bored in between these instances of deliciously gory detail.  There were also many points where characters repeated themselves over and over.  Perhaps this was done to emphasize the emotional impact of certain scenes, but I suspect it may have been the result of linguistic nuances lost in translation.  Cutting out some of these lines would have smoothed out the narrative flow and reduced a lot of the melodrama.  Writing tone was also a little too casual in some areas with wording that was far too light for the themes present.  Utilizing words with heavier connotations corrects much of this, especially in darker scenes where conveying the severity of the situation is contingent upon them.\n\nStory and writing aside, the artwork is phenomenal.  Character sprites are beautifully detailed and creative, all appearing as if they came right out an official Japanese visual novel.  Event CGs are equally as gorgeous with emotive imagery that greatly enhance the scenes they take place in.  My favorites have a slight impressionistic edge to them which helps convey fear, despair and pain much more effectively than words alone.  The backgrounds range from unremarkable interior buildings to truly breathtaking outdoor views and abstract images that build the chilling atmosphere spectacularly.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=480795418\nThe novel is quite long.  As a slow reader, it took me 10 hours to finish my first play through plus an additional 10  searching for all 14 endings.  And you'll want to get them all as there are important details hidden within each that shine a light on several enigmas earlier in the game.  Depending on your level of determination, you could spend upwards of 25 hours unlocking every ending and achievement, which is impressive for a novel with a $10 price tag.\n\nDespite any misgivings I had with the translation, Notch's intriguing mystery, creative horror, and imaginative ideas were enough for me to overlook deficiencies in its writing, which is saying a lot as I consider writing to be the most important element in visual novels.  Would the game have been much more enjoyable if the translation were better?  Absolutely!  But if you can get past the problems, you'll find plenty to entertain you.\n\nBottom Line: Recommended for visual novel fans who enjoy creative horror storytelling with high production value to back it up.\n\nNote - This game was provided by the publisher with the request to write an informative review.  No other consideration, compensation or instruction was received.","July 13, 2015","true","31.2"," 146 of 155 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","146","155","3","7"

What is goodness? What is evil? What is love? What is hatred? Your world has become an inverted image in my dream...\n\nNotch - The Innocent LunA: Eclipsed SinnerS is a Chinese Visual Novel that tells the tales of broken forms, iron wills and unbearable truths. Through my many experiences with either emotional, philosophical or psychological narrations in visual novels, I've rarely felt thoroughly shaken until this one little tale of loss and misunderstanding...\n\nThe narration opens up to a silent night as heavy rain washes the outline of a forest clean. A lone traveler moves within the darkness and attends his uncanny business, away from the spectators' eyes... By the arrival of the next scene, narration switches to first person, as we find ourselves in a rather dark and alien mansion. We stroll in the endless corridors in hopes of finding an exit, yet what we encounter would be beyond our most gruesome nightmares... Nightmares? "Was this... a nightmare?" Yuhito thinks as he wakes up, shaking in his bed. "So real..."\n\nOur hero is Yuhito Asakawa who lives in a rather secluded little village in a forlorn little island, alongside his family and his friend/childhood crush Nanami Shio. For reasons unbeknownst to us, the village is somewhat forsaken and no one seems to even remember the names of the two governing families nowadays. There is an air of unnatural peace weaved with shadows of memories long gone. The eerie peace this little village harbors is about to be disrupted by a quite malicious occurrence, and Yuhito's silent, blank reality is about to be filled with both wonders and horrors as he dashes out on a rather hopeless quest.\n\nNotch - The Innocent LunA: Eclipsed SinnerS most surely does not deliver your common expectancy from a visual novel. The story and character dynamics are rather brutal, gory and disturbing with detailed narrations most of the time with thematic implications of abuse, torture, abandonment, suicide and countless other traumas. Thus, if you are to pick this one on a drive, you should know what you are getting yourself into. Be ready for a cold hand reaching for your heart and a lump in your throat as you discover many happenstances of the past, the present and the future.\n\nMy sole complaint is that the translation is quite direct during the idle conversations between characters, failing to present nuances and context, - especially during Yuhito and Nanami's early conversation - which usually ends up being either out of place or straight boring. But when it comes to environment descriptions or the telling of ongoing actions, the narration gets elevated to a completely new level of immersion. If you'd clench your teeth and see through the first two chapters of the game, you'll be glad that you went through with this one.\n\nThe visuals - especially backgrounds - are wondrous alongside character animations. The soundtrack is quite good and underlines the mood of the narration any given time. Characters themselves are vivid and interesting thanks to brilliant storyline and tragic character backgrounds, even without any voice acting. If I were to be completely honest, the character development of the main hero, Yuhito stays subpar compared to other main characters of the story. He is somewhat of a one track minded simpleton, nothing remotely interesting. You keep playing to learn the story of other characters and admire the quite interesting yet creepy setting though.\n\nNotch - The Innocent LunA: Eclipsed Sinners is a treat for the suckers of gore, drama and psychosis with 14 different endings, marvelous character dynamics and a story revelation that you sincerely wouldn't guess on your own. Fetch it alongside a box of tissues and possibly a pack of cigarettes.

There's a summary at the very bottom if you don't wanna read the whole thing.\n\nI bought this because the several reviews promised an engaging, interesting storyline complimented by a colourful cast. I was warned the English was shaky, with translation awkwardness riddling the script. But I can manage the occasional awkward English, so long as the story was strong and the characters interesting.\n\nAnd guess what? They aren't.\n\nThe story is good initially, I'll admit. It immediately kicks off and you're pulled into the world. Directly after the prologue comes the scenes introducing us to the main character, a frightening dream-sequence that raises hundreds of questions.\n\nBut then the actual game starts, and you're staggered by how throuoghly moronic the protagonist is. The plot couldn't advance if he wasn't such an idiot. Also, he's not likeable at all - he's openly sexist and talks to his childhood friend, Nanami Shio, like she's 10 years old. He refuses to explain anything to her because he doesn't want to upset her, completely ignoring the fact that by withholding important information, he was setting her up for a tramatic experience. He doesn't talk, think or react like a real human being.\n\nSpoiler: after finding a mutilated body, he's briefly afraid, but calms down and begins to think of it as a crime scene. Suddenly, he's not disturbed, or even vaguely upset, by the violently murdered human being lying in front of him - just embarrassed that he freaked out. I thought, maybe, he was emotionally withdrawing, as people sometimes do when confronted with something so horrible, but nope! He's fine, guys. / End Spoiler\n\nHe makes the whole experience less believeable and frustrating.\n\nNanami Shio is the only other character I've met thus far (aside from a girl in a maid outfit, but she appeared very briefly before vanishing). The protag talks to her like she's 10 - and she sort of acts like it, too. She's obsessed with plants and flowers, is constantly expressing worry over the protag, and easily cries. This in itself isn't bad - there are women like Nanami, and there's nothing wrong with them. There's nothing wrong with an emotional, naive female character. The problem is that she isn't treated respectfully by the protag, who is constantly reminding the audience how lovely she is, even after a tramatic dream where he saw dead people, and Nanami covered in blood. Literally, that's the first thing he thinks after waking from a dream where Nanami is pertified and bloody - she's so lovely. He treats her like a child who can't handle bad news, infantilizing her in the same breath he uses to scold himself for sexualising her.\n\nIt doesn't help the translation is utterly terrible. They translated the Japanese so literally, the characters sound like robots. When I say that, I don't mean to imply the Japanese language lacks emotion, but what flows properly in Japanese sounds awkward, jerky and needlessly repetitive in English because of how different the languages are. Characters often repeat themselves like they're trying to up the word count on an essay. It's annoying to read.\n\nThe game's saving grace is its art - although the characters are very "anime", which I'm fine with, but might disturb some people - and its animations, which thus far are all good. Its music is average, setting the mood but adding nothing in my opinion.\n\nI'd recommend not buying this - unless the translation is redone so it's flows and the characters stop sounding robotic. I think the reason the protag feels so stupid and heartless, and  the reason that Nanami sounds like a woman-child, is because of the bad translations.\n\ntl;dr: While the story is good, the game suffers from idiot characters and terrible translations that are awkward and jerky. The main character is a sexist ♥♥♥♥♥ who doesn't act like a human being with emotions. Don't bother with it.","July 9, 2015","false","4.8"," 58 of 79 people (73%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","73","58","79","4","6"

Definitely worth it if you like VNs, in my opinion.\n\nHowever, bear in mind that this is not a happy, frilly, frolicking-in-the-sunshine-with-a-unicorn sort of story.  It is substantially dark, and that is reflected in many of the endings.  There is graphically violent subject matter, which didn't bother me in the slightest, but if you don't like a lot of gore you might be put off a little bit.\n\nThere is minimal fanservice if that's something that impacts your VN purchases.  For this story, it wouldn't have fit well with the story and I appreciate it wasn't forced in; it's something that has its place and doesn't bother me at all, but I'm glad the writers opted to keep it to a minimum for this story.\n\nThe language, like many VNs, is a little stilted and clunky in places which is likely a simple translation issue; some concepts and lines simply don't translate well from one language to another.  It didn't take away from the story at all.\n\nThe artwork, music, and sound are all nicely done.\n\nAll in all, a good choice if you like a dark, bloody story, and with fourteen unique endings, there's a decent lot of replayability.","June 22, 2015","true","24.1"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

Too much of the story revolves around the hero's girlfriend who we never get to know or become attached to.

Nightmare scenarious of eternal suffering are everywhere, and even if you go for the good endings, well... I'll leave that for you to discover.\n\nExpect to put many hours in to unlock all achievements and see all endings, even with a guide.

Thought evoking and story rich, this made for a very good read. I completed it in two 8hr sessions (yes, it was that addicting!), and that was only for my first playthrough.\n\nThe protagonist, Yuhito Asakawa, and his childhood sweetheart, Nanami Shio, reside in a remote town that has been long forgotten by the rest of the world. We first meet Yuhito and his beloved in a dream realm of horror, already hoping that the two lovebirds will find a way to escape the nightmare unharmed. And if Yuhito thought that was bad enough, his reality was about to get much worse. His once peaceful little town had been painted red by an elusive murderer, where the victims were all young girls. It is then that he decides to embark on this difficult journey to catch the killer and bring them to justice. Along the way, he'll make some interesting friends, struggle with reality and illusions, and grow braver and more determined with each step he takes.\n\n^That's just my little summary - short, sweet, and to the point, without spoiling too much of the story. Seriously, it took me 16hrs to complete one playthrough. ONE! And there are 14 different endings!

Bottom line is, if you're considering this vn, then do yourself a favor and add it to your collection.

How some or sometimes even one past experience can be the driving force that dictates our future and makes us blinded by the truth. Sometimes we know the truth, rarely do we accept it, and it is often that we dismiss it for fear of being hurt.\n\nHuman emotions are curious things, as two people can have similar experiences but their perception of the world can be starkly different. Revenge can be seen in two different ways.\n1.	You’ve taken everything away from me; I have nothing left, what’s left to lose?\n2.	An eye for an eye makes everyone blind.\n\nWith Notch, I wasn’t expecting to be brought to tears due to one particular character, Rika, her back-story and one other particular part of her story. I won’t go into any detail, as I don’t want to spoil it for people.\n\nThis is one of the very few VN’s were I was overcome with so many different emotions, which pleasantly surprised me, as man’s heart can be full of darkness yet a light still burns.\n\nOn a side note, I found that the game didn’t auto save, I only realised this after playing 4 hours and when I went to continue there was no save file. The ‘Escape’ button opens the menu for the game that allows you to manually save, also I found that the ‘control’ button was a life saver, it skips the text that I have read, so I can continue with different routes without getting bored of re-reading the same thing.","April 24","true","23.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

I've read Narcissus (An extremely good read), as well as Love at First Sight (A good but short read), and I have to say Notch falls a bit short in quality, but makes up for it by pure quantity and length. This is, in my opinion, a slightly longer read than I'm used to, and the writing is... mediocre. The story is decent with some twists and turns you may not expect. Anyway, time to make a easy list of pros and cons to look at:\n\nPros:\n-A ton a dialogue for those who can't get enough of hearing what the characters have to say about anything\n-Blood and gore for those into the horror genre\n-Multiple endings meaning you have to be (very) careful about the choices you make for the protagonist\n-A lengthy read to keep you occupied for the long weekends, or whenever you're bored xD\n\nCons:\n-Somewhat repetative dialogue. I find that sometimes the characters talk a bit too much, especially during situations where something important is about to happen. This is just my oppinion though.\n-Dialogue is rather simple, and the narrator is absent most of the time. I would prefer more descriptive writing, but this is just my preference.\n-Difficult to get a good ending. You may end up near the end of the of the story but finding yourself reaching a "bad ending" because of a decision you made very early on, forcing you to start over from the beginning multiple times. If you have the patience to do this, then it's not so bad, but I found it fustrating and had to look up a guide to finally find a proper ending.\n\nOverall 7/10. I still recommend this. I would have enjoyed this more if I didn't have to restart multiple times to find a good ending. Luckily I found out that holding down ctrl speeds up the process ;)","August 28, 2015","true","15.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Good translations capture the soul of the story as well as the raw meaning of the words; horrible translations at least stand a chance of being funny or charming for their onvious badness. Bad translations capture the meaning, and only that -- all the depth, all the charm, and every single drop of subtext get sacrificed on the altar of "makes sense gramatically, that's good enough."\n\nNotch - The Innocent LunA is an object lesson in why even if you get the words in the right order and they're all spelt correctly, It doesn't mean you have a good translation. I could discuss the plot, but the plot doesn't matter because it's extremely hard to care about what happens to the characters. It's extremely hard to care about the characters because they don't have a single shred of personality between them, and the reason they have no personality is because every single line of the VN is written in the baldest, most simplistic style that still passes for English.\n\n"Well," one might say, "even if we can't rely on the style of the text to make our characters likeable, what about their actions?" Well, the main character spends a good portion of the story being a condescending, sexist jerk without even realising it; then bad things start to happen, which prompts him to intentionally be a condescending, sexist jerk. The initial female lead is less of a character and more of an object/motivation. Random characters pop in and out of the story to do a little murdering; most remained unnamed and uninteresting for many acts.\n\nActually, I take back what I said about not talking about the plot. Even accepting that the poor translation might be stealing a lot of the thunder, the plot feels very shaky. The story is very dedicated to trying to be mysterious and not explaining anything for as long as possible; the problem is that it keeps doing for this so long that you don't care by the time things start to be revealed. A lot of the backbone of the work rests on the supernatural, and imho, this is what suffers most from the artificial mystery. Oftentimes, the story will explain its most recent plot twist with some kind of supernatural occurence, without explaining anything further; it feels contrived, like a bad fanfic.\n\nWhat is there other than the poor translation? The artwork is honestly fairly mediocre. The special effects that the game occasionally uses are a nice touch visually, but there's not really any striking beauty here. It's anime characters against forgettable backgrounds. While there's certainly nothing wrong with an anime artstyle, it's definitely no better than any other VN with anime artstyle out there, and worse than a few I could name. The soundtrack suits the mood most of the time, but there aren't really any standout pieces that I would want to listen to outside of the scenes they appear in.\n\nIn summary: this game's main problem is that the "visual" element of its visual novel structure is nowhere near good enough to compensate for the sub-par novel part. In a genre that relies so much on the written element of the work, there is no reason any English-speaking consumer should accept a translation like this. Maybe, in its original language, this is a powerful and thrilling story; in this language, it isn't. Buy only if you want to support more Japanese visual novels making their way to the steam platform, and even then, I'd recommend looking for alternative studios with better translations so you can encourage quality at the same time.","November 24, 2015","false","9.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

It's not flawless and maybe one could get more out of this... but nevertheless, It's a good story that may be inspired by Orpheus as a root... and then added with mystery, magic, tragedy...  It also has some sexual jokes, but it's like 2 or 3... and very mild (can be misunderstood... but I say: mild).\n\nTo talk more about the content itself: Some pictures are well drawn, others not so. There are only 2 possible choices... which are pretty much like "Yes/No" "White/Black", no mid-terms... and you can expect that from something like "every day life" from the persent to be thrown into supernatural stuff.  I'm sure that this is a low-cost production, and for what it is, it's great.\n\nI still haven't gotten the "good end", I ended up looking for guides to see what I did wrong... only that. The game uses something like a relation points system... how much you favour a character. I had the first few bad ends because I was "too nice" to someone I shouldn't have been to... very strict on that one. (I'm not going to follow a guide to get the good end, If I want to have no choice at all I'd just watch some mindless gameplay)\n\nI recommend you not to play this game while being sleepy... you should focus and remain watchful, you may miss something important if you don't and you will be punished in the end if you do. Happens in any game actually... so just take a rest if you're sleepy, games aren't meant to "calm down" or "relax" from big stress.","January 30","true","28.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's not voiced and the graphics are quite nice. The story, although mostly gory, is quite engaging. But the dialogue moved too slowly for me and I felt frustrated not being about to fast forward the chapter transitions, and other scenario transitions. It just took a very long time, like a powerpoint presentation that takes 30 seconds to move from one slide to another.\n\nBack to the dialogue, characters can literally spend ages just trying to make a point. Do you need 10 mins to say goodbye? I remember this is what happens sometimes in juvenile phone conversations - "You better go sleep" , "No, you hang up first", "No I don't want to hang up, how about you hang up?", "Why not I wait for you to sleep and then I hang up?" "But how would I know if you are sleeping already?"...\n\nI hope you get the point.\n\nIf you can bear with all this pointless dialogue and slow transitions, I suppose the game is still worth a buy.\n\n\n","June 26, 2015","false","8.8"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","7","14","2","0"

It had what you would get in any mystery/horror novel. The scary deaths, creepy descriptions, artwork in-detail of important scenes, and high quality music.\n\nbut... I wouldn't recommend this to anyone I know.\n\nThe protagonist, and (most of) the character interactions in the story were horribly written (from myself as a reader's perspective). The protagonist makes way too many stupid decisions to the point of trainwreck. Some of the characters had their moments, but too few to point out. Most of the time, the interactions felt too 'robotic'. That was the feeling I got when I was reading through the course of the characters development as the story goes on. The backstories for many of these characters were well done, and I was touched. Music is really the highlight of this visual novel, but that is where my compliments end. If it were only the soundtrack, I would recommend purchasing; but you would need to read the visual novel to understand the feelings and emotions of each track... so my stance is neutral towards the soundtrack being on sale.\n\nNormally, voice-acting in visual novels can compensate for a lot of things, especially the amount of emotion required to be portrayed during the course of the story; but since indie visual novels don't normally have the funds for voice-acting, I never held any hopes since the beginning. Of course, there are few exceptions like Katawa Shoujo, which also didn't have voice-acting but was beautifully written, drawn, composed, and laid out. It seems Notch isn't one of those few exceptions.\n\nEnjoyment: 5/10\nArt: 8/10\nCharacters: 4/10\nConsistency 5/10\nSoundtrack: 8.5/10\nSystem: 5/10\n\nPersonal visual novel  score: 5.6/10","July 14, 2015","false","27.6"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","1"

I'm in the third chapter now. I think that the main problem is that the writting is just awful. Considering the genre of the game, a visual novel, the writting should it strongest point but it's the worst one. Very empty and predictable characters, terrible construction of the atmosphere of the game - spoiler: a important character die and you can't even feel sad about it because the scene is extremely bad written. I mean, omfg, it's a tragedy. You should be able to empatize a lot with the protagonist feelings but you can't because he doesn't act like a normal human being living a traumatical event but as some sort of teenager avenger - and the ♥♥♥♥ing choices you get are so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ obvious. It's like "Do you want to save this girl when she's your best friend, the possible love of your life, and you have nothing to lose saving her or anything or you just want to be a jerk?", "Yes, I want to save her", "No, I dunno, I just wanna be a jerk.".  and though they must be important, considering the fact that this game seems to have multiple endings, they don't really give the feel of being important.\n\nThe art is acceptable and the soundtrack is good but if you want to buy a game with a good story, dialogues and characters, this isn't the right place. Maybe for a younger public that is still having their first experiences with visual-novels this is the right place but for me... It really didn't worked out.","July 15, 2015","false","1.7"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

The writing is stilted and the dialogue is dreadful.  Words are regularly misused and the entire thing reads like it was written by someone who doesn't understand how people talk to each other.  The characters, especially the main character, are inconsistently-written and often will do things that just make no sense at all, acting in ways that no one would act.  The female characters so far have really not impressed me.  They all seem to be based around the cliche kind, gentle, girl-next-door/victim variety and never seem to do anything except cry and wait to be rescued (there's the one exception of course, but just one).  I'm not a feminist, but really...some variety wouldn't hurt here.\n\nThe story itself isn't a bad one, in fact with better writing and more consistent characters it would make a good visual novel.  I'm rather surprised this has gotten so many positive reviews.  The key to writing dialogue, as a writer, is that after you write out a conversation read it out with a friend.  Does it sound like a conversation two people would actually have?  Do the characters sound like people?  If not, time for a rewrite.\n\nEdit:  Well, I made it as far as chapter 8 and near the end ot the chapter I'm throwing in the towel.  I've never read such drivel in my entire life.  The way the case is solved and the 'clues' presented are such utter nonsense I can't stand to go on.  This is not how detective work works, even in reality.  They basically just threw a bunch of totally circumstancial evidence together and claimed it was obvious.  I'm done.","October 28, 2015","false","68.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Would not recommend purchasing at full price.\n---\nThis game has so much promise. The graphics are good, the soundtrack is GREAT (seriously, the only reason I don't regret this purchase is because of the soundtracks), the attitude ot the protagonist is rather interesting in a good way (at least at the start), the premise and overall direction this is trying to go is fairly good.\n\nHOWEVER, this has probably one of the worst translations I have seen in a game in a while. And considering that this is a visual novel, this is a crippling flaw. You'll notice the authors of the reviews (non-steam reviews) have Chinese names, so I assume their praise is for the original game. The promises of those reviews will not be met in the English version of the game.\nThe translation sounds like it was either done by someone who has only had a year of language study, or perhaps Google translate. That is how awkward, repetitive, robotic, and horrible the English writing is.\n\nI would ony recommend getting this on a good sale, if only to get the soundtracks. Hopefully, this game will get retranslated, and I can give a true positive review. Full price, I would absolutely NOT recommend this game in it's current form.","December 16, 2015","false","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
