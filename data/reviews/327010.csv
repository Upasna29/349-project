"http://steamcommunity.com/id/none1234/recommended/327010/","none1234","None","http://steamcommunity.com/id/none1234/","527 products in account","I bought this game out of an obsession with old American cars and hot rodding. In the screenshots it looked as if there were some convincing recreations of classics like the '59 Fairlane, '61 Thunderbird and first generation Corvette. The last time I can recall a notable racing game focusing on this subject was EA's shortlived MMO "Motor City Online" back in 2001 which only survived a couple of years before the servers were shut down.\n\nSo what do you get for your money with this game? Well, not a lot really. The cars, it seems, have not been officially licenced, so although they look convincingly enough like the real things, the names of their manufacturers have been changed. However, their actual model names are in many cases preserved. For example, there is a '53 Chevy 210 which is actually called a '53 210 but supposedly built by "Oceanic". There is a '53 Cadillac Eldorado called a '53 Eldorado but by "Belvedere". The models have Chevrolet and Cadillac badges, respectively, and have "Chevrolet" and "Eldorado" lettering, respectively. Perhaps it costs big bucks to actually use the manufacturers' names in a game, even when the vehicles depicted are sixty years old. So maybe we should not be too hard on the developer about this. What we can be hard on them for is the rest of the game.\n\nThe actual gameplay itself is not very interesting. The driving challenges are rather boring, the AI of the drivers you race against is horrific and the game is beset by bugs. There are fewer now than at launch, owing to a patch, but others remain. The developer stopped engaging on the community hub after releasing the patch, so it looks like those bugs are here to stay. The aforementioned car models are quite pretty, but the car handling physics are awful and you might be stopped in gameplay by invisible objects on the road.\n\nYour AI competitors can collide with each other and with you, and you can collide with AI traffic. However, the AI competitors do not appear to have any sort of collision detection with traffic and just drive straight through it. The AI cars get a headstart over you in each race, with you always lagging behind to start but, then again, they also find it difficult driving down a straight road without spinning off.\n\nThere is a progression system, where you gain levels by earning points for winning races and for "style" by doing things like overtaking, driving closely behind a competitor (called "slipstream", but why bother with this acheivement?), cornering "perfectly" (although you can be awarded this even for massive imperfections), "drifting", and "speed threshold". The progression seems capped at the end of level 10 (i.e. you do not progress on to 11, although it is apparent that you are supposed to be able). However, thereafter you continue to get the end-of-level-10 rewards after earning even a single point in any race, which include a special vehicle. I have now more than twenty such vehicles in my "garage". This would not be so bad, if there was a facility in the game to sell these cars, but there is not, so I keep accruing them. The car awarded is a "1936 Emperor", which itself has a rather buggy 3D model and which is at odds with the quality of the other vehicle models. It looks as though its suspension has collapsed, and it has wheel hubs appearing lower than the wheel centres when you change the rims.\n\nThe biggest let down for me was the customization of the vehicles. Vehicles are presented as having four different performance characteristics: "Acceleration", "Speed", "Handling" and "Grip". Each one is awarded a percentage. There are eight ways to increase the performance of each vehicle: "Carburetor", "Supercharger", "Engine", "Torsion Bars", "Transmissions" [sic], "Suspensions" [sic], "Brakes" and "Tires". Each component you can change has three levels of improvement over stock. "Carburetor" and "Engine" improvements affect "Speed", but not "Acceleration" (who knows why). "Brakes" improvements affect "Grip" but not "Handling" (again, don't ask me why). This is too simplistic to be in any way interesting, and pales in comparison to the customization options in Motor City Online more than a decade ago (which were not perfect by any means).\n\nThere are also visual customization options: each car has available four each of "Front Bumper", "Rear Bumper", "Side Skirts", "Hood" and "Muffler". Changes cost in-game money earned in races, but for some reason have escalating prices, despite not offering a performance benefit, and the most expensive part not necessarily being the best looking. Some of the changes, like "Side Skirts" are too all-encompassing. This option also changes the front and rear fenders and door panels, and is available regardless of whether the car model you are modifying actually has side skirts or not. It would be better if you could change aspects, like the front and rear fenders seperately, or the front bumper without changing the grille, for greater customization. You cannot chop the roof of your '49 Merc (or '49 Belvedere Bonanza, as it is known in the game), or lower its suspension. You can change the paint, but the range of paints is not very pleasing, and some body panels are frustratingly unpaintable if the car has a two-tone trim, which is quite common.\n\nThere are options to change the wheels and tyres (called "Rims" in the game, seemingly an anachronism), but this does not always work, despite the fact that a lot of wheels have been unlocked, they just cannot be selected. Some of the wheel models are broken or missing, so when you do select them the car's wheelrims disappear or they appear incorrectly.\n\nThere is no drag racing. There is no option to just drive. There is no damage modelling. There is no dashboard camera, views being restricted to either the front bumper or a chase view. When you change the speedometer reading to miles an hour (instead of the default kilometres an hour, in a game set in 1950s America!), the distances remain given in metres. The music is a few tracks of boogie woogie instrumentals. Derivative modern compositions, obviously, and nothing faithfully from the era. These are played repetitively and there seems to be one track for the main menu, one for driving in game, one for finishing a race and looking at the score board, etcetera. At first I thought the music was by default a bit too loud, but when I turned it down to hear the dreadful sound of the engines I was glad for it. The engine noises are another major disappointment. The engines sound more like four-cylinder Datsuns than American V8s in this game. The only exception, so far as I can tell, is the Corvette, which does actually have a V8 sound.\n\nThis would not be such a bad game if it was available at a much lower price. The full price as of this writing is Â£14.99. This is what I would call a premium price range and this is a long way short of being a premium game. I have had plenty of better games through Steam for a lot less money.\n\nTo cut a long review short, I would not recommend buying this game unless, like me, you must have virtual representations of classic American vehicles on your computer which you can race, albeit in a limited fashion. [13/12/2014: In light of a patch, I have re-written parts of this review. The game is, however, still in a broken state owing to the level cap bug and its awarding you the same car again and again which the patch did not address.][07/04/2015: The devs implied that the patch released in December of 2014 was only the first, but it now looks like it was also the last. Game abandoned by developer maybe? Significant bugs remain and no announcement of a fix.]","November 23, 2014","false","8.8"," 133 of 145 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","133","145","2","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zerathos/recommended/327010/","zerathos","Locke","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zerathos/","1102 products in account","Motorama is, quite frankly, one of the worst games I've ever had the displeasure of playing. I saw the bad reviews beforehand, but the theme seemed appealing and I figured that as a budget purchase it couldn't be that bad. Oh how wrong I was.\n\nThe game fails in its execution of basic concepts from step one, step two, and and all other steps therein. For starters, options are as barebones as barebones gets. Surprisingly they did manage to implement separate music and sound effects sliders, which is always something I look for in games (most games have the music mixed too high for my liking), however they don't work. Anytime you finish a level, the game reverts to its deafening full volume until you go back to the options and select the sliders again. This is a major annoyance and is one of the reasons this game no longer takes up valuable space on my hard drive.\n\nAfter going through the options, the game railroads you through some poorly-designed dialog. When you press A to clear the dialog, it'll act as pressing A for whatever happens to take focus when it goes away, forcing you to do things you may not want to. Once you've been unceremoniously dumped into a match, you are given no instruction whatsoever on how to play. I still don't quite understand what all the buttons do (Y seems to make the screen flash for a second, for instance), and I had to work out myself that the boost only works when you're at a certain speed (at least I hope that's why it doesn't work half the time I press the button).\n\nAnd to top it off, the handling is atrocious. Sometimes driving in a straight line will send you careening out of control. Making controlled turns, or even worse, a drift, is next to impossible. The car just constantly wants to spin. And best as I can tell it's literally impossible to win the first match because the other cars are just better than yours in every single way, so short of being an expert with the drift and boost system (and what new player to this impossible-to-control game is going to be?) to make up for the massive speed difference, you're going to lose. And then be told you won, because third place is good enough, and there are only three cars. Just...why?\n\nI'm familiar with games where the cars take some effort to keep on the road; Driver San Francisco is one of my favorite games of all time, but the cars are definitely tricky to handle until you get to know them. And I've played Early Access games like Super Toy Cars that lack polish but have good ideas, and eventually get patches until they're in a fully released state. But this game is just so bad on its first impression that I cannot stand another moment to even see if different cars handle better. All I know is I bought a speed upgrade and my car instantly became even less drivable. The game seems more half-baked than your average Early Access affair, but is supposedly a fully released product. Just avoid it all costs; it's not even worth it on sale. It's got bugs that will never be patched, and deep issues with the mechanics that will never be fixed. Spend your time on better games instead.","April 30, 2015","false","0.4"," 60 of 69 people (87%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","87","60","69","7","0"

There has been some graphical bugs in the form of cars or terrain flickering, or drivers floating in the air, and even unsee-able maps that render the game unplayable at times.\n\nYou earn rewards as you play the game, and there are a decent amount of\ncar selections and upgrade performance options, but the cost of purchasing\nperformance upgrades plus the cost of purchasing new vehicles does not balance\nwith the cash awards for winning in races.  This leads to a lot of grinding just\nto get enough money to buy upgrades (which are necessary), to progress forward.\nThere is also a lot of selection for cosmetic upgrades for those that like to\npimp out their vehicles.\n\nOverall I found that if you didn't establish a big lead in the first 20\nseconds of gameplay, you have little to no chance of winning.  If you are leading\nthe race, your competitors magically catch up in the one straight segment of road\ndespite you holding a significant lead throughout the rest of the track.

I'll definitely get my  money's worth out of Motorama.\n\nThe Good:  The cars are interesting.  There is a lot of customization for each and every car.  The game definitely pushes all my nostalgic Street Rod buttons.  Can't wait to build up a garage of custom classics!   You definitely need brakes to take corners, so it's not 100% arcade racer.\n\nThe Bad:  Music is loud and repetative (volume seems to reset after races).  Controls are awkward to set (prelaunch menu w/o labels) and default setup is strange (shoulder buttons for manual shift).  Sound effects are mediocre, definitely missing the rumble of leaded fueled V-8s (in the early game, anyway).  AI opponents clip through NPC traffic but you do not (!!!).  "Drifting" was called "powersliding" in the 60's.  ;)\n\nThe Ugly:  Being a Unity game, graphics settings are bare bones (resolution and low/med/high).  Cars do not shade when driving through tunnels.  Controller vibration does not work with 360 controller, so there is very little feedback or road feel compared to other racers.  Only two camera views (bumper and 3d person), but camera controls (left stick for pan, Y for look back) are sufficient.  No car damage.\n\nBottom line:  Yeah, pick it up.  Play it a weekend.

I did encounter some shadow glitches, but it could be my machine. Also, in game modes with 'traffic', the A.I. cars seem to be able to drive through the traffic cars...\nThe areas are pretty well done and really capture that 50's feeling. Since there are only like 5 different areas, you've seen them all very quickly into the game, which should not be a problem, if there tracks were well done, which they are not. The tracks are mostly straightforward with a few corners and lack originality, do not expect shortcuts but expect invisible walls. Most tracks are just rehashed tracks, so you often have to race the same tracks, which have some minor variations.\n\nThe gameplay is not that bad but nothing special either. Obviously, cars were slower back then, still the creators added some nitro to boost up your speed. I personally never heard of cars using nitro in the 50's, but then again I'm no genius on the subject.\nThe difficulty accompanied with the terrible A.I. , are probably the reasons why real racing fans would not like this game. Motorama is a very easy game, even for me. As long as you upgrade your car from time to time, you should have no problem winning a race. The bot A.I.'s , sometimes drive around like they're drunk or think they are playing Carmageddon.\n\nPerhaps, this game is only interested for real classic American car lovers, right? Well, even though there are some nice looking classic cars, the developers do not own the license for cars that really exist(ed). They do look a lot like them though and personally, I did not really care but I think the fans would mind. The upgrades you can perform on your car are pretty standard aswell. Upgrading your motor, different set of wheels,... we've pretty much seen it all, even the visual upgrades aren't that special.\n\nOverall, Motorama is an OK game but it just feels like it could've been way more. The races are not fun enough and the game lacks content to be fun for more than a few hours.\n\n\n","April 23, 2015","false","0.9"," 21 of 29 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","21","29","0","1"

I usually try to find the positive in any game I play. This game has the potential to be a good, decent budget racing game but with the current problems it has at the moment keep it from being that. First off its a simulation game that thinks its a arcade racer at times. I played this with a PC controller thatâs shaped like a Xbox controller and a wired Xbox One controller. And with both controllers the steering is a little too sensitive at low speed. Even with a car fully upgraded its still real sensitive. No matter which car it was it would want to run off the road with just a slight push. Speaking of off road, when did dirt and grass feels like driving on ice? The road itself the game is fine. But once you go off-road, it feels like you're taking your car with street tires onto a frozen lake. Thereâs absolutely no traction at all once you're off the road. Even with one of the tracks having what looks like short cuts, they offer no traction at all. So its best just to stay to the road. The AI in this game are as smart as a box of rocks. Starting with the first race all the way to the end, the AI makes some REALLY dumb mistakes. Almost all the time one of the 3 AI in a race will just swerve itself into a wreck and the other 2 will wreck each other while you cruise to a win. This happens in all the Sprint, Race, Knockout, and Escape. And don't expect the AI get wreck by the cars on the track. They just drive through every single one that isn't a race AI or you. But don't expect yourself to run through them because most of the time if you even tap a car, it would almost put you in a dead stop. Thatâs right, you can be doing 160 and tap a car and you're down to 0. As for the race types, you have the 4 I have mention, you also have Stunt Trial (which appears 1 time) and Lap Record (Time Trial). So you have a good set of race types for the 5 levels in the game. For each level you have 4 races you have to do but you have to complete 4 objectives to compete against the boss of the level. So for the 5 level its rinse and repeat 5 times. And for the simulation part, you have a level system that gives you "upgrades" to nitro and special cars. I never noticed any nitro upgrades and the special cars are nice till you hit the level 10 bug. Then you will get the level 10 car over and over and over after every race. And with no option to sell cars in the game, you are stuck with a lot of the level 10 cars. The game is imbalance in a way that I took the first car you get, upgraded all the way, and won races all the way up to level 5. They game isn't worth the price they want for it in its current state. But with some work and some spit shine, this could become a decent budget racer.","December 28, 2015","false","4.6"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","14","18","0","0"

Looking at the screenshots this game looked appealing to me and I immediately wanted to revive the nostalgic experience I had with games like Street Rod back in the day. Street race for money and then upgrade and customize your car, sounds great.\n\nLuckily this game was in bundle so I at least don't feel ripped off but I'm writing this for people who might think about buying this for 17,99â¬ (or whatever equivalent) or even anything more than 2-3 bucks.\n\nThere's so much wrong with this game I don't know where to start...\n\n1. Content\nI won every race in this game within 3 hours. The content in this game is simple math. There's around 10 cars, 5 race tracks and 8 racing modes, which sounds like a good variety factor but it's not... you go forward, you win, you crash, you lose. Career mode is build of 5 events, each containing 5 races. That's it. I finished whole game with the very first car I upgraded becase it was best (yea). Customization is very limited. Basically contains 2 categories: performance and visual upgrades. Visual upgrades are kinda nice but you won't care about them. You will save money for performance upgrades and cars and then you will finish the game and propably upgrade visually just for the achievement. Other than this Career mode there's nothing else to do. There's no multiplayer. No challenges. No other playmodes. No difficulty setting. No nothing... Thankfully. Why? Let's get to the next point...\n\n2. Gameplay\nI don't know if I am even capable of describing how horribly this game handles. Controls are simply laggy and unresponsive. Thankfully you just go straight forward most of the time. Sometimes you had to slow down not so you won't crash while turning which would transform your car into unhandleable mess. The very first car is only one that handles "not so bad" when it's fully upgraded... the "better" cars goes crazy during turns and some even starts slipping just because they go fast. Even AI has constant problems handling the cars. I'm not even kidding, it's hillarious. Propably only positive thing I came upon while playing. But I digress. The so-called Career Mode is basically this: you find first race you're able to win, you repeat it for cash, buy upgrades until you're superior and win just because you go faster. Colission model is a joke as well as physics, there's no destruction model, no weather changes or any other features you might be used to in racing games. Instead of features, there are bugs.\n\n3. Bugs, glitches and constant nonsensical behaviour of this game\nOn Steam, this is propably closest you can get to infamous Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing. It's not nearly as bad but as I said... I haven't been able to buy racing game on Steam that would be even remotely broken as this one. Your opponents go through the traffic (you don't), you can't disable music in menu (you can but after every race it's on again), you go trough trees, controls sometimes don't work and stuff like that... my favorite was when I started a Knockout race which starts with animation of you and your car setting off. But instead of going forward, the animation made me go backwards which resulted of me going reverse and giving my opponents headstart.\n\n4. Visuals\nI don't care about graphics and talking about how this game looks would be beating a dead horse. I can say that some of the screenshots on Store page with the sunlight effects looks edited because the game don't look appealing like that in reality. The visuals are not awful. They're functional (no graphic settings btw. ... was this a mobile phone game?) but it just doesn't matter at all because everything else is horribly done.\n\nVERDICT\nI wouldn't recommend this to anybody unless you're achievement hunter in which case optimal price would be 2$. Price tag of 17,99â¬ for this is an insult to Steam users.","March 25, 2015","false","3.3"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","16","24","0","1"

Very simple graphics and simple game play put together to give a fun game. There is similarities to the very old Street Rod game and this is actually the reason why I purchased the game in the first place.\n\nAfter playing for a few hours you get tired of the glitching graphical bugs, the game possibility of a game breaking bug that gives you a negative 214,000,000 points for a progression acheivement. And of course putting all that behind to realise that not only is the game very very short (3 to 4 hours repetitive game play, but it is impossible to complete. There is a race map with a graphical glitch where you cannot see the road or ground at all. And of course the game will not let you progress until you place in the race without ground.\n\nAlso a note on the full controler support. This game was built around a controler so much so all the menu options are "A", "B" or "X" with each not actually corrisponding to actual keyboard keys. I would be shocked is this game was not a direct port (cheeply done) from a games console. You do NOT neet a Joystick or Game Pad to use the game at all. You just need to use the force to find where the keys are.\n\n\nConclusion\nThis is not a Need for Speed, but an old school racing game with some very cool cars to play with. A little over priced but so full of bugs that the game is unplayable. Do not purchase this game at all.\n\nNOTE I have changed my review to an initial positive to an out right DO NOT BUY.","November 21, 2014","false","2.7"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","13","19","0","0"

Still, in that half hour I've seen more than enough to make a short review of this game.  This doesn't feel like a complete game but for a couple dollars it's worth it.\n\nIt's noticeably lacking anisotropic filtering; a graphical setting that vastly increases the look of long distance textures without causing a large hit on performance.  This is a huge issue for a racing game in particular because of how far ahead you'll be paying attention.  If this is in the game somewhere, it's not included in the PC High settings that I selected in the launcher and I haven't seen an option in the actual game.  This is odd because the screenshots clearly show areas in the game with a high amount of anisotropic filtering enabled.  If it's in the settings files then it should be on by default for medium and high settings.\n\nAnisotropic filtering example:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/POg9HHj.png\n\nThe next big issue in the game is traffic.  I've seen traffic drive off the side of a road and that's just with one race that has traffic enabled.  I also saw the AI go straight through the traffic while you can't do so.  It's good that you can't but the AI shouldn't be able to do so either.  It would probably be better if they just got rid of traffic altogether if they're going to take the cheap route and make it where the AI doesn't collide with traffic instead of programming them to go around traffic.  It doesn't seem like they cared too much about realism which is a bit of a shame.\n\nNow that I'm done talking about the negatives, I'd like to talk about the positives.  This is more of an arcade racing game that allows you to customize your cars.  You can buy performance parts or even change what they look like.  This is a good feature considering most games that do this only allow you to change the paint jobs which is a bit disappointing considering games like NFS: Underground 2 are already over a decade old and nobody has created better car customization in a racing game.\n\nThis game can be kind of fun if you get it for cheap.  Not bad if you buy it in a bundle for $3 like I did.","July 13, 2015","true","0.5"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

Pedals, sliders or joystick axis will not register therefore preventing you from playing; you need to unplug the joystick / gamepad and relaunch the game prior to being able to play with keyboard only.\n\nWhen you first launch the game, you can't use any of the menu options; you have to first enter and exit or complete a race before other menu options ( such as garage, etc.. ) may be accessed.\n\nKey bindings don't work for keyboards just like they don't work for gamepads or joysticks... Trying to use rearview camera it flickers quickly between the rear then back to front as though it excepts as axis. This could be because there isn't a way to unbind a key from the options menu and I changed the keys and the only way to clear it up was to either set both primary and secondary as the same key, or set up a single key somewhere it'd hopefully never be used as all...\n\n\nI got this game in a bundle for less than pennies on the dollar. This game reminded me of motorcity online years back which was pay-per-month and decided to purchase the bundle to try this out. I'd rather play one of the earlier need for speed games ( with interiors / Porsche ) because the physics respond much better in it, the graphics are just as good and you get to drive classic vehicles.\n\nIf you want an enjoyable racing game with upgradable vehicles, check out the burnout series which doesn't cause you to stop instantly from 150 mph speed because of a road glitch, or if you slide across the guard-rail.","January 16","false","3.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The devs, who are pretty active in their forums, do promise future updates for the game. It's obviously not a full release upon playing it right now though and many bugs are encountered. Now at first I was a little upset, but when I went to the forums I noticed that there are planned updates and the Devs  are pretty much responding to almost every post. The only problem I see is that people are sucked into buying it from what the screenshots look like and what the description says, which isn't false at all, just lacking information. It should have been stated on the store page that this game was still in development so atleast if people got upset, it would be their own fault for not reading the description. Instead it was not stated which has lead to a high number of negative reviews.\nMy thoughts:\nI think the game has great potential. The cars are not liscened so they are recreated versions of real cars but they resemble real cars very closely both visually and with their names. There is lots of upgrading to do on each car both in the performance area and in the visual area, leaving a lot of customizing and time spent in the garage. There are 3 teirs of upgrading performace parts which for some reason are all available to purchase form the start which automatically makes me upgrade to teir 3 and skip 1 and 2. They should probably implement a ranking system or a Class A through C liscense system to stop this from happening and actually allow for more playability. The game runs on the Unity engine so the graphics are what you can expect from Unity. Shadows don't fall in the correct place at times and the textures seem a little solid in some places.\nAs far as gameplay goes, it could use some work, Cars don't take damage and NPC's can no clip right through the traffic. Thats is just a couple of things I experienced of the many listed bugs on the forums. I also chose to turn the music off due to only a couple songs being played, becoming quite repetitive and headache worthy. There are 5 areas you race throughout the game, each resembling a popular 50s themed race, like the ditch scene in the popular movie Grease. Overall once you get the driving down, it's actually fun to play and the updates mentioned by the developer seem to make for a promising full game, when it gets there. I have yet to experience some of the weird bugs Ive heard about like falling out of maps or the game just crashing to the desktop so I'm under the impression that those are computer related issues with the game, not the actual game itself.\nNow I do recommend checking this game out eventually, but It might be best to wait a little to make sure updates are being pushed out. Again, I think this should have been released as an Early Access game so please take that into consideration before buying.","November 26, 2014","true","1.5"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","8","15","0","0"

You can literally hear where the music loops.  And there are only a few tracks.  Worse is the BGM is tied to the level you're racing on, so the first few courses are tiring.  Best bet is to just turn the Music slider to off and leave the effects on.\n\nIt's also buggy.  There are two different parts in my LP where I fall through the world and another where my car is just going through psychedelic colors for no apparent reason.\n\nIt also feels like a milquetoast Unity game.  It's a weird sentiment, but if you've played a Unity platformer, there is a resemblance to other games you've played.  I am having difficulty putting my finger on it, but it doesn't feel like they tuned the game all that much outside of the imported physics engine.\n\nThe AI is laughably easy.  All you need to do is shove them and then it's practically game over for them.  They'll be zigging and zagging all through the course.\n\nHaving said all that, I was still having fun.  The progression system is a bit too slow, but there is one level where you can grind money fairly easily.  Also, it's not often you get to play a racing game set in the late 50's/early 60's hot rodding era.  I only went two ranks deep, but I haven't had a chance to race for pink slips yet.  I'm not sure if it's in the game, but that would be nice. (maybe it's because I only have one car?)\n\nIf it gets cheap enough on Steam sale or gets bundled, definitely give it a try.","November 24, 2014","true","0.9"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","12","23","2","0"

This game feels to me like an early access candidate.\nThe game uses the Unity engine, so at the start you're presented with a launcher, that let's you pick a couple of presets and redefine your controls. But there is a twist - the game actually let's you rebind your gamepad controls to your keyboard, so instead of using a standard and well established control names (brake, accelerate, handbrake), your stuck rebinding J1righttrigger and J1horizontal (+) ... and I decided not to mess with it. So at the start of my first race, the racing game turned into a puzzle one, as I was trying to decipher my keyboard controls - found out a,z,x,c,v,space not sure if these are all of them. Those were of course the easiest to figure out, good luck finding out the more important ones - replay the race, go to garage after race, go to menu - I gave up and ended up using my gamepad keys just for that purpose .\nOnce you figure out your keys, you'll establish, that the keyboard controls is not so bad, but the car handling on the other hand ... Before my first race I was presented with a choice of a car to buy and as a racing game veteran I picked the faster one with lesser handling, comfortable in my skill. Boy oh boy was I doomed - the car was almost uncontrollable in over 100km/h and every slightly more sudden turn sent me out spinning to the last spot in the race. In retrospect, this might have been by design as the first track is not exactly on a street and once you upgrade your handling, the cars feel waaay more responsive and actually enjoyable to ride. I still just can't shake off the impression, that the cars are sliding over the track, rather than driving on it, but that may just be me.\nThe graphics are nothing special, but reasonable, and sadly, littered with bugs - seizure inducing texture blinking, car textures disappearing or blinking and the occasional stuttering are a common sight. Activating the "nitro" results in full screen (Gaussian?!) blur, with very little acceleration gain, but huge visibility problem (for me at least), so I avoid using it.\nThe music is era fitting ( I guess?), but gets repetitive fast and the volume control is utterly bugged and resets to MAX upon race completion, which is frankly infuriating, so I ended up muting the game all together.\nThe AI has trouble driving in a straight line and ends up spinning quite often, if in front of you, while when behind, puts the "turbo" on and speeds past you with unreachable speed - that only happens on one track for now though, on the rest of them it just feels like you're competing against old ladies behind the wheel (no disrespect!). I can overlook the fact, that the AI has no collision detection with the incoming random traffic (while you have trouble colliding with bigger-than-visible car models), and account that as a feature, to up the difficulty.\nOn the bright side, the game offers quite a few cars and racing modes, there is some level of car customization and upgrades. Even though the upgrades are usually a flat 5% increase in a category, the change some of them provide is quite distinguishable. I highly recommend going for some handling upgrades at start. The linear progression of the upgrade's price and the flat % increase promote skipping of the mid-tier ones and going for the best asap. The money you make is not enough for that, so you really need to replay races to get dosh. The easiest way to do that are the knockout races.\nOverall, Motorama offers nothing special, but I suspect, it can become quite enjoyable, once the huge amount of bugs has been cleared. Sadly, as of this moment, I simply cannot justify the price tag and will not recommend you buying the game.\n\nTL:DR you can watch my salty video, as I rant about the game:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=346261890","November 24, 2014","false","3.9"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","6","12","0","0"

Prior to purchase I read all the negative reviews, so I was wary, but\nI decided to give it a chance, for the sake of the Fifties cars.. First off I must say that this game is loaded\nwith glitches and bugs. Every error you've read in any review is true. I've had the game freeze, my car fall\nthrough the map etc. Never the less I managed to get gold in all events and unlock all achievments.\nSince the game doesn't come with an instruction manual, this causes some issue for some who play it. I personally recommend you own an xbox controller if you want to play this game. To stop the annoying music you must turn it down in options then press 'A' to save it. To drive the cars in the game .. and win, you must be very carefull when driving through water, or dirt. This will cause your car to lose traction. Your car comes with nitrous, which you activate via the "a" button. To build up your nitrous meter, you must get driver achievments during the game like drifting, which you activate by pressing the'B' button for emergency brake.\n\nThe most difficult track is Keegsquaw peaks 'Spring water laguna' . It's extremely difficult to get through this track,\nwhich you need to do to progress. It's likely the game makers intended this to be a dirt track, as any car\nbehaves terribly on the surface. This map is also likely resourcce intensive for the game engine, and the car wanders left and right continuously . To get past this level, you need to buy the right car, with the right handling upgrades.. and drive the aoppropriate speed in the right areas. I also  lowered the game graphics quality to the lowest level, to stop the frame twitch.\n\nMy main dissapointment was from the advertisement clips on youtube for the game say "25 sixties cars" .. well, there are only 15 game cars you can drive in this game. I was looking forward to driving the 1956 chevy which, is pictured on the website, and in the game. But the car was cut from the game ansd replaced with a 1949, merc, and given some generic name. This car was likely cut from the game by the developers, in addition to wheel selection, likely because these game elements were causing game bugs.\nThe Ai is so terrible that the game becomes unintentionnally funny, as the cars continuously drive into each other. If you drive head on into traffic, quite often the traffic car will jump over your car, like the Dukes of Hazzard. yee haaa!\nBut i paid 5 bux for it and I got to the  end in a day or so... it was ok for 5 bux.\n\n\n\n\n","April 16, 2015","true","0.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

But you know I think I I might of been too harsh. So here is my new review of the game, if you can even call it that.\n\nIf you asked me to sum up Motorama in a few short words it would be. S h i t heap of broken physics and gameplay.\n\nWell Motorama seemed like a very good game on paper but now that they have made it this game should have been thrown in the bin and set fire too as soon as it was thought up. The games physics are just outright broken and glitched. The other racers have a tendency to just give up and sit the rest of the race out and let you do endless laps because the race never ends. This game was so â¥â¥â¥â¥ I decided to contacte the devs for a refund but no. They said that they couldn't do that as Steam had taken variosue taxes from it. But these guys couldn't just send me the Â£12 I spent on this game straight to my visa account. Ahhhhh. Customer satisfaction seems really to be key with these guys.\n\nIt was like they don't even care about the game and that they have released it.\n\nLead Game Developer: "DONE! Job done guys we can all go get wasted even more now then whilst we were making the game. GG guys GG" Thats what I can imagie was going through thier heads when they released this pile of horse poo.\n\nI refuse to buy anything from this developer for quite a while.

At the current state of things definitely not. Sure you can play it as it definitely has potential as an indie game, but the core problem is elsewhere. The numerous bugs in this game (some less severe than others) are quite problematic, but the main issue is that at the writing of this post the developer hasn't been online for a whopping 119 days. With that being said the bugs that are in the game will probably never get fixed, due to the absence of the developer or staff for that matter. So in the end I might give it a super bad note but I just can't stand it if there are obvious bugs in the game and they aren't rectified. So on that note I'll give it a 2/10.","April 3, 2015","false","4.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I don't know that I would pay much more than that for it.  It still needs work.  The graphics are okay (dated for 2014 when it came out, think 2005 or so), the controls are okay, and the AI is not very forgiving.  There is also a big where at least half the time the AI just clip through traffic.  Also, knockouts sometimes just don't work.  You may have to reboot.  Then there is the flashing and ripping terrain and completely irrational AI 'NPC' car behavior, like stopping and backing across the middle of the road...\n\nYou cannot configure the controller (and no wheel support), and even if you turn off music, it still plays when not racing, which is annoying.  The cars are recognizable, but the names were all changed.  It is kind of annoying at the beginning because your car is slower to accelerate, slower top end, and has less grip and handling than the other cars.  You have to replay races repeatedly to get enough money to get enough mods to win, and repeat this cycle until you beat the last boss.\n\nAt 50c this is about a 4.5/10, maybe for 100% achievers (guilty) who want a somewhat quick racing game to complete.  For others, it may be worth 50c because you will get an hour or two out of it before you quit in frustration, but hard to say how the quality of your experience will be.\n\nAt $19.99, I think it is a prolonged April Fool's joke, or the developers are hoping for some charity because it is insanely overpriced for an unpolished indie game.","April 21, 2015","false","7.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

But if you take it for what it is, an indie game attempting to evoke 50s movies, there's a decent amount of fun to be had. The visuals are nice, if outdated, and it runs well on my low-end PC (Athlon 64 X2 5400+, 4GB RAM, Radeon HD5450, Windows 7 64bit). And the handling of the cars is a nice balance between arcade and sim; you can't just go full throttle and drift around the curves, but it's not at a punishing realism level of Gran Turismo or Forza either.\nThe "steal your opponent's girlfriend" bit is silly out of context, but does fit in with the 50s film concept.","March 21, 2015","true","2.0"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","4","11","0","0"

Speaking of style you can also level up based off of how stylish you are for doing things such as drifting. These will get you to level up but itâs also important to do well in the race and not just look cool. After the first race depending on how you place you will get money to upgrade your vehicle and boy will you need it.\n\nThe first cars you will get are letâs face it terrible they handle awful and or are slow, you can buy some upgrades at the start with your start up fund but your car isnât going to be a Ferrari.\n\nYour objective is to beat the 4 best racers but to do this you have to prove your good enough by completing various challenges, they each have challenges that you must complete such as winning $x in prize money. This means you will do each race several times to unlock the best of the best.\n\nThe music of the game is either something you will love or something you will hate. The soundtrack consists of 1 song that you will hear constantly on loop and it may just drive you insane.\n\nThe game is created in unity as many indie games are and allows you to change your graphics. The first track of the game reminds me of an area in grand theft auto San Andreas but looks a bit higher resolution.\n\nThe game itself is fun and gives you the feel of a mariocart game were the AI is cheating as it seems easy. Enough to get into not last but the guy in first seems to have a rocket strapped to his car. Your car doesnât have a health bar so ramming the enemy and trying to get the lead is fun and works for a while.\n\nOverall if you do not mind a slow grind to a better car then the game is a fun little racing game and if the music doesnât drive you insane then you should have some fun with this one.\n\nThere isnât much in the way of story and the music will drive some people crazy, taking that into account the game is fun and if you enjoy racing games you should consider picking it up 8/10\n\noriginal post\nhttps://gamingmalarkeyreviews.wordpress.com/2014/11/26/motorama-review/\nvideo version\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRAeT8MsZ5g&list=UUlTsUPRAB2mma2wtDwIaD5Q","November 26, 2014","true","1.0"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","3","9","0","0"

Just don't!\n\nPros: It has a simple premise\nThe cars have reasonable designs\nCons:You need an xbox controller. You can't map your keyboard keys.\nWhile it draws the mouse curser in the ui, you can't actually use it. It won't autohide either.\nThe graphics look 10 years old despite being run on a Unity engine.\nYou can turn down the (cheesy generic) music in the options, but it forgets it when you're done with a race.\nIt uses trademarked car names (Mercury Eight Coupe 5, Chevrolet 210, Ford Anglia etc) but I've not seen any copyright notices on that, so the developer could end up getting sued.\nYou can't delete/restart your career if you picked the second car option and found out it isn't viable.\nThe AI is cheating. For instance it can run thru traffic.\nThe garage menus are not intuitive. If you upgrade something you need to press A according to the message, but B works the same.\nThe physics are a bit wonky. If you upgrade your car completely, you can only drift using the handbrake. And in general sometimes the car will just go left for no apparant reason.\nNote: I've only played the first couple races. Maybe there's gameplay hidden somewhere futher along, but I can't handle the suffering it takes to get there.\n\nps.

Pricing is ok for Motorama so I feel ok to this regard.\nRepeating what I've read from other users, game seems to be designed for Xbox or PS3 and the PC version just take the 'pad' control heritage, but at least to me that doesn't mean any important problem.\nSome minor bugs and glitches experienced but the overview is that Motorama has met my expectations.\n","November 22, 2014","true","1.1"," 7 of 18 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","7","18","0","0"

Now fooled into believing you purchased a rather robust, somewhat complex game, you play it.\nThat's when the sheer brilliance hits you right in the face  like flirting with Shaun Connery and you come to notice, Every, Single, Design, Choice! and i do mean every single one, perfectly and intentionally created a game void of any fun. It literally beats watching paint dry and yet you think such a genius concept was accomplished unintentionally.\n\nI for once, thank 251 Games for reminding us Games are a form of art and for having the balls to do so with the worst Video game ever since Desert Bus.\nOn a side note, i would like to point this game out to the most infamous devs on steam.

I really enjoyed the era influenced art and music, although wish there were a few more tracks available. After about an hour I don't really want to hear that song for the third time again....\n\nThe system is pretty basic compared to other games like this. You race, you get achievments, you get money to upgrade the mechanics or customize the look of your car. You get special points for completing things with "style" while driving. Through achievments you unlock higher levels and you can repeat previous levels to gain more money, and so on. I found it challening and fun! I didn't encounter any major bugs or errors, so overall it is pretty good. I don't find myself playing it very often, but I do pick it up once in a while.\n\nIf I notice the price tag change to a more approprite number, I will change my review to recommended. :)\n\nP.S.
