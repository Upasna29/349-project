"http://steamcommunity.com/id/evil_incarnate/recommended/338140/","evil_incarnate","Evil incarnate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/evil_incarnate/","1022 products in account","Venetica is a psuedo-RPG action-adventure by the good ol' Germans who have managed to forge one of the most unique, yet nostalgic, psuedo-RPG games I've ever played. The game closely resembles to that of the original Fable for the original Xbox - intentional or not - because the aesthetics, gameplay mechanics, atmosphere, the British humour/writing/voice acting along with a general auroma of being brought back to the world of Avion despite Venetica being an entirely new game.\n\nThe combat, whilst simple and arguably too easy and exploitable, is always fun to play around with. You earn exp to unlock more skills, such as blocking and dodge rolling, which further enhances the tactical movement; but as such, most fights end with bashing the hell out of your enemy until they stop blocking you. The difficulty of the game actually comes from combat, enemies have higher health, deal more damage, nothing special or out of the ordinary but somehow each encounter feels refreshing even though they have no right to. In the end, it all boils down to having a fun but repetitive fighting system and in my opinion, it works.\n\nThe world and environments look fantastic, beautiful and level designs are inspiring yet linear. As mentioned earlier, I get vibes from the original Fable and this is because of the feel of exploration and the atmosphere the game retains throughout. Surprisingly, each dungeon also feels special and have their own purpose: no tacted-on random dungeons for waste-of-time extended hours, I feel like each place has a purpose. Quests, they tie-in to these dungeons, feel like an achievement upon completion because of the combination of fighting and level design it makes you feel like you are running through an epic journey, but it's as I said, this game has no right to feel this way.\n\nThis game also features a weird lockpick mini-game... which to be honest I never understood at all, it might put you off the game in fact. It's just.... weird, I feel it doesn't sustain the attributations the game has to offer elsewhere. Also there's a lack of customisation for Scarlett... there are limited costume/armours and they only have one slot to boot ala Fallout, this is disappointing. Having said that, I feel the design of the armour themselves are fitting and well done.\n\nActually, the game is surprisingly long, especially if you take the time to go quests and explore everything. There's more I wish I could say but I want to keep this spoiler-free, I think experiencing this game fully blind is the best and I'd say intended way of playing Venetica.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend this to those who like RPGs, third person action titles, obscure adventure games and of course, the Fable games. I don't recommend this to regular FPS, strategy and sports players. I think this game has a niche market that's still untapped but there isn't enough justification in the game to make it mass appeal.\n\nNOTE: I HAVE HAD THE RETAIL PC AND PS3 COPY OF THIS GAME SINCE 2010.","January 23, 2015","true","0.3"," 178 of 215 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","178","215","5","1"

And so far, I have found that Venetica is one of the few RPG games that I have tried recently that can hold my interest enough to make me want to keep playing it. So, with that said, here is my humble review of Venetica.\nThe graphics in Venetica are decent enough, I suppose they aren’t great. The scenery is quite wonderful though, very panoramic at points. It’s a great game if you are into screen shots of your character set against a backdrop of an awesome scene, especially vast cityscapes. The game is a tad cartoonish, with lots of exaggerated colors and characters, but still realistic enough to let you get lost in its surroundings.\nAdditionally, I loved the voice acting in this game. I’m pretty certain that Venetica is a German-made game, and obviously it’s set in Italy, and the voice actors are British, which is very cool. I thought the voice work was terrific and I especially liked how the main character Scarlett was portrayed.\nI will not try to review the combat in Venetica except to say that I found it easy to master and I enjoyed the varied and unusual skills that my character could earn along the way as the game progresses. I'm an older, more casual gamer and Venetica's combat style suited me just fine.\nThe best part of the game for me was the terrific main protagonist Scarlett. She is an absolute delight! She’s really likeable and she’s lots of fun to play the game as. She’s tough without being mean spirited and she’s pretty and smart as well. The only thing that would prevent me from proposing marriage to her is that she’s the “daughter of death”. This would then make our children the “grandchildren of death” and I think that would sort of make our family reunions a bit awkward. Anyway, I do totally wish that there were more awesome female characters like Scarlett in PC gaming. There certainly should be, anyway.\nAnyway, I enjoy playing Venetica quite a bit and I think it’s worth a play if you dig 3rd person RPG games like Fable or Gothic. The devs seem to be quite responsive to any posts or questions that I’ve seen in the game forums, and that’s a big plus, too. Some players have experienced a crash or two, but the devs remain engaged and involved on the Steam forums and there’s a decent community of gamers around to help out, too.\nThanks for reading my review and I hope you’ll give Venetica a try, if this sort of game is your thing. Scarlett is way too good of a character to pass up, if you ask me.\n","May 3, 2015","true","25.3"," 57 of 59 people (97%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","97","57","59","7","9"

It's familiar, heartwarming and nostalgic. You'll always end up needlessly excited, note that it is also always welcome.\n\nWe take a deep breath, and dive into the tale of Scarlett. She is a young woman who lives in a quiet mountain town, some miles away Venice. It is a charming evening for the mining town of San Pasquale: seeing off the pride of town, Scarlett's fiancé and childhood friend, Benedict to join the Knight Order.\n\nThe homely celebration is cut off short by a band of assassins, who are in search for someone ferociously, slaughtering everyone in their way. It takes one act of mercy for young Benedict to lose his life, and for Scarlett's life to turn upside down. The Death comes to her, and whispers Scarlett a long kept secret: she is Death's daughter, and she is to venture forth for the city of Venice, to unmask the malefactors of a grim conspiracy that threatens the balance between life and death. From that moment onwards, nothing is going to be the same for her.\n\nFair warning: if it is an RPG game, and if it contains actual RPG elements, I'm ready to love it quite easily. So my review might be a bit biased. Scarlett's tale contains a diverse selection of gameplay, and quite a lot of both mandatory, and optional quests for you to take on. According to her choices, you'll be given the chance of following different paths, and let Scarlett set sail to an ending only one can try and guess. The storyline is refreshingly interesting, and abilities that we unlock step by step are curiously imaginative. As the story progresses, our beloved heroine shall see through the eyes of ravens, step into the Nether Realm to discover areas unseen to mortal eye, seek and speak with the dead to learn their tales. Including your imaginative mental skills, combat options are fairly easy and even boss battles won't frustrate you more than half an hour or so. The marvelous part is not the action though: it is the RPG.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful and reminded me Fable series, looking back from year 2009. The setting is surprisingly rich, and the reality is not static at all. The world abides by a cycle of day and night, including a consistent timeline. You run by the same alley for the 10th time, and discover something else just because you are happened to be there in the right time. It is also possible for you to miss quests, if you were to complete something else beforehand, and consequentially make the other unreachable. Based on the scenario choices, one would need at least 3 playthroughs to see everything that Scarlett can do in the world of Venetica.\n\nI've discovered this gem during summer sale, and we have been together ever since. I think we'll have a long enough fling to leave me with great memories. If you are in need of an action RPG, with sweet sense of humor and basic enough gameplay that would never frustrate you, Venetica is available. It is always good news to discover an RPG anyhow! Am I right or what?\n\nUpdate: I've finally completed the game and the last moment of the game reveals a plot so fundemental and unexpected, it is a mind blown!!! I found myself invested in Scarlett's tale here. Deck 13, Please, please, please there be a sequel someday!?!??!!!\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","August 31, 2015","true","43.1"," 56 of 65 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","56","65","0","0"

Be wary of the potential for CTD's, though. I CTD once very few hours for no reason with a vanilla setup.\n\nGraphically, this game is very reminiscent of Fable, as you'll see in other reviews. Cartoonish, fluid, and a wide range of facial emotions for Scarlett, the main character, who might I add, is pretty cute. Her armors, clothing, weapons, and animations are quite well designed. Landscapes and environments are also a pleasure to look at, though generic NPC's all seem to meld together after awhile.\n\nThe soundtrack is appropriate for its genre, though you may need to fiddle with a few settings to get the right volume balance. When an NPC mumbles, they really mumble inaudibly, so you'll want subtitles on. Otherwise, the audio is pleasant and non repetitive.\n\nThe gameplay is what you'd expect from an RPG, with leveling up, unlocking skills, and what have you, but I was pleasantly surprised when NPC's teach you valuable information that makes combat all the more entertaining and easier that doesn't factor into skills, like ducking and rolling, chaining attacks, and so forth. Combat feels satisfying and rewarding to a point where I don't find it a hassle to see enemies blocking my path.\n\nBeing from 2009, it runs like a good bicycle. The maximum resolution might slow you down, but it's not otherwise demending on your system. Mine isn't a gaming rig and it works great, so if yours is a gaming setup, you'll be happy with its performance.\n\nLike I mentioned above, however, I do get the occasional uncalled for CTD in the middle of some action, my google-fu hasn't given me a solution yet. The game autosaves occasionally, but not enough to remedy a CTD in the middle of a boss fight. You'll want to save every so often to prevent going back too far. Your milage may vary, maybe the problem's on my end, but I've made no modifications or changes to any major settings. FYI, I crash maybe every two hours.\n\nOther than the CTD, The game is worth its price. My boredom has been sufficiently satiated for a reasonable price, and that's all I really wanted.","January 25, 2015","true","9.5"," 45 of 50 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","45","50","3","3"

So game has everything that one would want from RPG. There is only one average aspect and that are textures, they look kind of 2005ish, but artstyle is great so it does not bother me that much.

However, be expressively warned of bugs like insane frame rate drops (can be fixed by restarting the game), random, unexplaineble and reproducable, but avoidable, crashes, which as far as I believe, won't be fixed anytime soon or ever. Luckily, there are no plot stoppers though. I understand that others down-vote it for that, but I won't.\n\nSo, the combat is really fun in my book (haven't really tried magic), the voice acting ranges from okay to "meh", RPG-mechanics do their job, meaning: don't expect anything deep character-development-wise and the quests are okay (nothing groundbraking there). Graphics won't excite anyone, but it is no bother, because lighting, overall art- and character-design and effects are mostly quite alright to look at. Only most textures are downright abysmal. for today's standards at least. It even lures you into thinking that your choices in dialogues matter, they really don't, but that's not that big of a deal for me. A neatly told plot is better than incorporating branches no one really cares about.\nAnd Venice as the setting sure doesn't hurt.\n\nSounds kinda mediocre, right?\n\nIt is.\n\nDeck 13, the german adventure developers aren't known for Crysis-like eye-openers or action driven shenanigans, they are known for dialogues, characters and the fun of telling stories through a game. So, all things considered, they did pretty well with this semi-open world game out of their comfort zone. Because it has its heart in the right place. Which matters a lot to me.\nI think "charming" would be the appropriate term. This game is that.\n\n\nAlso, Scarlett.\nOne of the best, most likeable and prettiest butt-kicking female protagonists in gaming ever. Take note, Sarkeesian drones, you might have a shining example at hand. For all I care, most of all those big-breasted polygon bimbos, which serve as eye candy and selling point in games, can go to hell. They have nothing on her. Nothing!\nAnd I will start fist fights over it. I said, I'm biased, leave me alone.\n\nSure, this game isn't exactly afraid of the "sexy-factor" at times (sales matter), but it doesn't dwell on it and i'm not complaining about sexy in general anyway, because that would make me a hypocrite. Also it is low-poly anyway...\n\nBut I think I might have a very irrational crush on virtual Scarlett, in case you haven't noticed. *sigh*\nAgain. Because I pirated this game back then, liked it and had a second playthrough on Steam just now for a trip down memory lane. And to atone for my pirating sins, of course. By paying for it.\nAnd because of Scarlett. Well, mostly because of Scarlett.\nDid i mention her?\n(On a sidenote: the effort put into keyframing her hair animations still astounds me for some reason, i know of no other game that did this so well, or, at all.)\n\n\nI would love (even beg) for a sequel to this game to happen. Because all-in-all, it's actually one of my favorites and from a purely subjective POV, i am just digging the hell out of it, with all its nooks and crannies. Why else would i have bothered to babble on about it in this review, anyway?","March 30, 2015","true","24.6"," 26 of 28 people (93%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","93","26","28","12","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kony4/recommended/338140/","kony4","kony","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kony4/","707 products in account","Venetica is a game I expected to be average at best. Moreover, the first three hours are terrible, you start as a village girl and just follow the corridor, whack some professional assassins, listen to uninteresting dialogues and whack more poor assassins. I was at the point of abandoning the game, because the sole looking at ♥♥♥ and arms of cute Scarlett was not enough to keep me interested.\n\nI just decided to force myself to play it until I get to the Venetica city as the village at the beginning is basically a training. And once I got to the city, wow, what a sudden turnaround.\n\nIn the city the game became good out of the blue. Writing wasn't deep but Scarlett got a sense of humour and quests were aplenty and often no more about killing assassins or killing at all. Boring hack'n slash transformed into a role-playing game and the place wasn't so much of a corridor anymore (albeit still somewhat was as the parts of the Venetica open up along with the storyline). The story is bad and some dialogues are cringeworthy, but many of them are decent and usually the writing is okay. Unfortunately, many of dialogue choices are not only fake as to leading to the same outcome but worse - quite a lot of them lead to once short answer until you choose the "correct" one. Kid doesn't want to tell you something? Intimidating him to cut off all his fingers? Trying to be nice to him? Forget it, you can do these all you want, but until you choose "here, have some sweets" option you are getting nowhere...\n\nIn spite of the above, the quests make up for it, and so is the setting. Dialogues, albeit with all their drawbacks, are decent enough and the game is just fun. You may enter every single house in the city too, stealing from its residents (for the greater good of course). The city districts vary a lot and there are also catacombs and so on, hence why locations are interesting and have a different feeling to them as well.\n\nOverall, it is a very decent game, definitely worth playing if you enjoy cRPGs. If only the beginning wasn't so bad, the game would probably gain much more popularity. Nonetheless, it is worth to go through the boring start and then find a very enjoyable action role-playing game.","August 21, 2015","true","19.1"," 34 of 42 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","34","42","2","2"

She doesn't know who her parents were or what secrets will unfold in the coming times. The village is attacked and some blame the only outsider. The one who raised you will offer you know information about your past so you must seek it out on your own. You love dies, but you feel he is somehow helping you. You must go out and kill those who seek to kill you. You will level throughout the game, but can only use skill points at the proper trainer. You can specialize into melle combat, or be more twilight/magic orientated. You will get weapons, and armor throughout the game. The different weapons are used for different purposes. Hammers can blast down certain doors for example. The armor you find must be taken to a smith where you will pay to have it fitted to your body shape.\n\nThe Good\nMagic and Twilight powers  are quite interesting. The dead will also help you along your quest in ways you may not expect initially. The game does have gamepad support, and I had zero issues getting my 360 controller working after I set the game to use it. It does also support 1080p resolution and other graphic options. The game itself comes off very lighthearted once the first 30 minutes of the game or so are over.\n\nThe Bad\nI admit it... I laughed as your love dies because the whole scene just felt terrible. I don't even feel the voice acting is bad as much as it being to over acted for the animations and graphics the game has. In that sense it comes off a lot like fable because in Fable I can't say I felt a thing when your village burned to the ground. The combat itself is very lacking. They teach you to roll in combat early on, but honestly I just walk away instead because I find it works better. I'm not saying its totally broken, but it is pretty weak. The graphics in the game itself feel more like it came out toward the end of original XBOX era. Bugs still exist in the game, and I've actually heard some can make it so you can't finish the game if you aren't careful.\n\nConclusion\nThe first half hour to hour of the game is easily the worst experience in the game. Once you get into this title it can actually be pretty fun. If you enjoyed the first fable, there is a descent chance you'll enjoy this. I am a bit bias, but I'd go with a balanced build that leans slightly toward magic. The game does offer some replay factor since you can only join one faction once you get to Venice.

Not sure about the other guilds.\n\nFor those who are recording this by the way and having the problem of levels not loading completely because of the software your using to record. I simply stopped record before going to the next area where it was going to mess up and resumed it, then edited the footage together. I've only had this issue occur after I completed the final mission for the Net of the Mask guild. Not sure if its involved in some way with that.\n\nMy only main issue with it is the fact that the armors you get feel absolutely useless. Unlike other games where your new armor increases your defense to everything, you get armor that only protects you against certain weapons. Not necessarily bad, but the problem is you tend to get these armors "after" you've finished the area you needed the armor for to begin with.\n\nLike I just finished Africa but I don't get the African armor that defends me properly against their spears until after I've beaten this section of the game that I will never return to. Kind of pointless when the next area makes the armor I get in Africa completely useless.\n\nOnly best option here is for me to just hack the game just to get the proper armor I need for the level because otherwise I'm never going to use it.","November 21, 2015","true","43.8"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

Now I can recommend it, as it solved the problem for me, but keep in mind there is still a risk.\n\nPROS :\n\n- a nice, lovey heroine\n- simple but effective combat system and camera auto-lock\n- nice ideas like being able to switch between the world of the living and the world of the dead. You can find secrets, and even do it during combat to escape your enemies or sneak behind them. You can also break fragile doors with a hammer.\n- you can't wear the armors you find directly, because they are fitted for the big guys you fight, not a petite heroine like Scarlett. So you have to ask a smith to make them fit for you.\n- as the left click is used to attack AND loot, you can't loot whith a weapon in your hand, so they added CTRL+click to do so, which is nice.\n\nCONS :\n\n- ugly graphics and textures, especially the environments ( we can see the texture seams, some normal maps are inverted, we see the separation between the meshes EVERYWHERE, etc. ). I know it's a game from 2009 but common guys, it looks so amateurish.\n- CTDs, CTDs everywhere, the game is just unplayable ( half of the forum posts are about people getting CTDs )\n- performance issues even with a GTX 660ti which can handle Skyrim on high settings\n- physics make the game stutter ( reinstalled physX, doesn't change anything ), breaking a pot will put your PC on it's knees.\n- I've looked everywhere but didn't find a mentor to teach me how to pick locks and skin animals. So since the beginning I see locked chest I can't loot and I kill animals I can't skin. When entering the world of the dead thanks to a skill next to a skeleton, I can see an orb of energy, maybe a ghost or something, but I can't interact with it, I guess I don't have the skill too.

A combination of the low price tag and not having anything else to play drove me to buy this game, I did some preliminary research and bought knowing that it would be fun, but not expecting a masterpiece.  This is what I saw:\n\nGraphics:\nThis is one of those games that isn't going for photo-realism.  Instead it offers a vary stylized world like Dishonored, Borderlands, or Fable to name a few.  Because of this, I believe the game has aged very well, it's not supposed to look like real life so the fact that it doesn't have Crysis 3 visuals doesn't bother me.  That being said, if you are a very visual person and you don't like stylized graphics the visuals are really going to bother you here.\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay is realtime, and is primarily based around striking and dodging.  It's about hitting without being hit.  Later you learn how to block, but I never really found it as effective, especially when fighting groups.  The combat is great in some places and not so great in others.  When you're fighting other humans like assassins or soldiers the game is really fun, because your enemies will block and dodge back at you so it's not a slugfest, but beasts and monsters are another story.\n\nIf I had to say what I liked least about the game it would be fighting monsters because they don't know how to block or dodge.  What that means is that all you have to do is hit first and keep slugging away at them with your combo chain.  I suppose the developers realized this made monsters incredibly easy, and decided that to compensate they would give monsters a ton of health, which only serves to make the slugfeast even longer and more irritating.\n\nThat being said, the combat in general is fast and easy to get into, while at the same time not being mindless.  I've only played the game once, it should be noted that there are many magic abilities that I never got to go for physical combat skills, so I can't really comment on how they add to the experience yet.   I intend to explore that on my second playthrough.\n\nStory:\nThe overall story of Venetica is not exactly an original one:  you live an ordinary life until your world is turned upside down by trained killers hunting for you and kill at least one person you love causing you to swear revenge.  Then a long journey to eventually hunt down and punish those responsible.  But in Venetica it is all the things that happen along the way that in my opinion make this game a treat to play.\n\nThere are many choices and decisions Scarlett will have to make throughout the course of the story ranging from the important to the arbitrary, that really help you flesh out who your Scarlett is.  Ethical questions frequently arise such as "this person tried to turn me into the guards, but he claims his family would be hurt if he didn't, do you believe him?  Even if you do, is it safe to let him live?" Having played through to the ending I'm only going to say that these choices don't have much barring on the ending.  That is to say, there is no epiloge where they go through and tell you what came of all the choices you made.  I expect a lot of people will be bothered by this.\n\nHaving said that, I appreciate all the choices being in there because at least for the first playthrough it makes me stop and ponder these moral delimas and issues of trust, and allows me to immerse myself in the story more and make Scarlett to be who I imagine her to be rather than the developer telling us who she is and what she stands for.  Or even worse... the silent protagonist.\n\nWorth mentioning:\nSometimes what you have to do to advance in the story isn't exactly straight forward, and the game definately does not hold your hand at times like these.  You may need to consult a guide one or more times throught your first playthrough to get through.  I wouldn't worry too much about that though, I myself only needed to consult a guide twice, nevertheless, the more you know...\n\nOverall:\nI bought this game, as I said above, mainly out of boredom.  I knew it would be somewhat entertaining, and I was assured by other reviews that it is quite a long game (and it definately is, my first playthrough clocked in at 20 hours).  I could not be happier with what I ended up getting.  The world is engaging and the combat is (for the most part) fast and fun, and I really enjoyed all the choices to make on the way through the story.  If you don't mind stylized visuals, and you like swords and necromancy, I would recommend giving Venetica a try.","January 30, 2015","true","35.9"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"

The heroine of the tale is Scarlet a young strong willed maiden who travels through the astonishing city of Venice and countryside seeking to avenge her fiancee who gets killed in assault by mysterious folk.\n\nBeing quite generic RPG the game Venetica contains all the basic elements: side quests, various enemies (Robbers, skeletons, giant bats), different weapon types etc. The fighting system works fine combining dodging, hit chains and some special attacks and/or magic which are unlocked from skill trees. Just enough to make combat strategic and active.\n\nThe story stays facsinating the whole playthrough and most of the characters are interesting and voice talents know their job.  I still would have hoped deeper contacts to some characters whose potential is wasted after strong introduction. There is two different ways to conclude the game and this is determined by the moral choices the player commits - usually cases are quite black and white.\n\nAll in all Venetica is a solid 20 hour long package which might not surprise or dazzle, but is good enough to provide a fix for lesser or stronger RPG hunger.","April 30, 2015","true","22.1"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

Two; some of the skills like blocking shouldn't require unlocking; let alone for each weapon type. Stategically one will often find it appropriate to switch between weapon types depending on your oppenent or situation; however, instead of having one dedicated block button you must assign each of the block "skills" to a quick slot. Not only is this awkward in the heat of battle there aren't enough quickslots to begin with, even without needing one for each block. These quickslots are the only means of using your powers and require you to swap them out in the pause screen frequently and is very tedious. Three; this game is riddled with glitches. Many of which cause it to crash to desktop or make progressing impossible.\n\nIt's a shame, because under the problems there is definitely a great game that's fun and even had the potential to be much better with a few added touches, but the issues it suffers from make it difficult to appreciate. If you have a lot a of patience to deal with these things and you can get it on sale like I did, then maybe give it a shot.

Even down to the poorly acted cockney accents, clunky interactions with npcs and it even looks like Fable.  It's Fable.\n\nIf you liked Fable, you'll like Venetica.  I read a bunch of reviews and thought it was going to be a really cool new take on action rpgs, but they really should've said that it's Fable and that would've saved me a bunch of time.  I'm not complaining.  I loved Fable AND Fable II and I can't wait for that real 3rd entry in the franchise that was supposed to blow my mind!  Until then, Venetica!\n\nUPDATE!\nAfter playing the game a little further, I've made a few more observations that I feel are important enough to include in my review.  The game also has quite a few core problems.  I've found that, if timed right, most fights can be won by simply mashing the left mouse button (attack).  I've very rarely had to dodge or block or use any other fighting mechanics which should be a lot more important.\n\nI drew a comparison to Fable, and with it's gameplay and visuals, I was right-- Venetica is Fable.  However, Venetica has absolutely no likeable characters and some really terrible voice acting.  I find myself skipping through most of the dialogue and wondering why the hell every male character sounds like a total blowhard.  For example: I think they intended for the blacksmith in the beginning of the game to be efeminate, but he just seems like a pompous windbag.  The few times when he doesn't sound completely dismissive of you, he just comes across as plain creepy.  Like he's trying to hit on you with the subtlety of Richard Ramirez without ever actually saying anything remotely sexual.\n\nJust some minor complaints.  The game is still good enough for a recommendation, but don't expect a masterpiece.\n\n6/10","January 27, 2015","true","4.5"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","11","18","2","0"

Spent the next hour and a half watching Liz Katz' lets-play of Venetica (cue duckface and cleavage both ingame and irl).  Turns our heroine Scarlett is the daughter of Death and after an unfortunate mishap involving her bae , a sword and some pillaging assassins she is given the powers of death to seek revenge.Oh yeah , also ultimately defeat some evil necromancer lords and save the world.  Sounds badass right? Visually I think the game looks a lot like Kingdoms of Amalur (another arpg I've had my eye on for a long time)  Also the art style looks pretty similar, all the bloom ALL THAT BLOOM. Seriously tho , the character designs other than Scarlett herself (she kinda reminds me of the Lara Croft in the Angel of Darkness model) all the minor characters look straight out of Amalur with their big noses and pointy cheekbones.\n\nGameplay wise its somewhat faster paced compared to other rpgs. You really need to mash the attack button to kill your enemies faster. About an hour in the game you learn how to roll , a skill which is primary used to get a few quick hits on blocking enemies , but I have found it can be used to dodge some portion of their attacks as well.\nYou have a 'twilight bar' which revives you if full. You can only fill it by using the moonblade tho.\n\nSkill trees are divided in two - physical and spiritual skills, which you can only buy with xp at certain trainers , in a similar fashion to other german arpgs like Gothic and Risen 2 as far as I remember. On the physical side of things we have all the combat skills including block (yep block is not available from the get-go , but ist probably the second skill you will buy)\nOn the spiritual side you have your "magic" abilities. Im not big on "magic" so I wont get into that but I will say this: Scatlett , the daughter of Death , has a crow who shows her the way to the next objective. Coincidence? I think not!\n\nOverall not a bad game so far , there are some puzzles here and there , combat is ok , and visuals , although a bit dated , are pleasant.Controller support is ok with a 360 controller, the layout is not the most common one with A being attack and X being roll and B - block but you can change it in the settings.\n\nAlmost forgot. If you have trouble with game messages not popping up (tutorial and hints and such) enable them in the options and disable the steam overlay , that fixed it for me.","April 10, 2015","true","21.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This game has outdated models and animations (which is to be expected for a 2009 game using the Odin 3D open source engine), it's full of minor bugs, can get a bit repetitive, and it doesn't even have St. Mark's Square, which should be a given for a game called Venetica.\n\nYet, it's a fantasy RPG, and it's not 'the' Venice, it's just 'a' Venice (just like Brugge and other cities famous for their canals), more precisely Deck 17's Venice, and to me they perfectly captured the spirit of an ancient city of wonders. In fact, I thoroughly 100%'ed the retail game back in the day, and bought it twice here (?!) just so I could share my appreciation for itsuniverse. The heroine can be badass, most of the quests are interesting, and well, what can I say...

The story and world is fully voiced, and although the dialogue (especially the choices you are given) is a bit "off" at times, overall it suits the world of Venetica.\n\nThe gameplay in Venetica consists of exploration, combat, and occasional puzzles. The combat in Venetica isn't bad; but it is held back by a horrible camera, especially since much of the combat consists of dodging enemy attacks. The puzzles scattered throughout the game are reasonably simple but contribute to the game's diversity and help keep the overall adventure engaging.\n\nThe game's presentation is done reasonably well, although there seems to be some optimization and frame rate issues with my more than capable PC. The world looks good and is packed with objects, but it has a lot of small areas and tight locations that are made even worse by the poor camera.\n\nOverall the game is definitely worth checking out (especially at it's low price). If you are a fan of Action RPG's and don't mind a few technical issues, pick this one up.\n\n+ Detailed World\n+ Unique Story\n+ Gameplay Diversity\n\n- Bad Camera\n- Occasionally Strange Dialogue\n\nOverall So Far: 7/10","June 12, 2015","true","2.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Well let me tell you what you'll have to look foward to.\n\n+/- A decent story from what I could tell. Unfortunately with one-sided characters that are interesting at first, but become very boring once you learn how they are.\n- A "karma"-esque system that gives you no feedback whatsoever.  If you're going to give me karma, then tell me the results of my actions.\n- The illusion of "Freedom". Many decisions to make in-game, none of them with any effect in the form of an epilogue. Just a slightly altered dialogue line (if even)\n+/- Beautiful and artistic MAIN character models (Because everyone else's literally suck)\n- The graphics other than the main characters literally suck. Textures were done better in 2008.\n+/- Good music, when it actually plays. And its a shame I've only heard 5 different tracks now that I've played for 9 hours.\n- Graphical glitches! In the form of light flickering, shadow flickering, textures overlapping, birds that disappear, and textures simply becoming fuzzy.\n- Very annoying hitboxes. You have to clip into some monsters to hit them, made me miss a lot of skill attacks, which waste "mana" btw.\n- Physical skills costing the game equivalent of "mana" as well as spells. This is the single stupidest design choice I have ever seen in a game.\n- TOO. MANY. LOADING SCREENS! What happened? Did your engine suck that bad? 2009 was the 2nd biggest revolution of graphics card tech and CPUs did not suck back then either. I shouldn't need a loading screen for every building and every "area". Especially if every area can be run across in 10 seconds.\n- Bad optimization. For the few areas that are not as small as 10 seconds to run across, the game takes a ♥♥♥♥ in performance. I can run the witcher 30 with well over 60 fps, so this is on the devs.\n- Recyled monsters.\n- Recycled quests.\n- Recycled dialogue.\n- Dialogue repeating twice in the same sentence by the same NPC.\n- Dialogue not matching the subtitles.\n- CRASHES. SO MANY CRASHES. One breaks the game about 2 or 3 hours in and forces you to run the game in compatibility mode for Windows XP (SP 3). Makes no sense for a game released the same years as Windows 7. The rest occur randomly when entering new areas or talking to people. Oh yea btw, talking to your brother in Venice? Breaks the game. Dev is aware of this and has done absolutely nothing. Also, game crashes very time you alt-tab.\n- No ability to sprint..just jog at a slow-motion speed and watch your sluttilty-dressed female protagonist's hair move as if the game was playing at half speed.\n- A SEVERE lack of quality animations. Some of the walking animations in this game are hysterical to look at. Some doors "teleport" open. Seriously, were you so lazy that you could only program quality animations for the main character?\n\nOverall, I give this game a 1/5. It was horrendous. I was enjoying the story but there's so many things wrong with the game that no matter how hard I tried, no matter how many breaks I took. Every time I closed this game I was red-faced with stress, anger, and disappointment. This was 9 hours of my life I am never going to get back, and about 20 of yours if you get this game and play it to completion.

Not the worst game in the world, but nothing to write home about either.\n\nGood concept, wonderful art/character design, and decent enough combat mechanics (pretty much like Fable except not done as well and with less weapon variety) are squandered by wonky to the point of infuriating boss fights, a general lack of game balance ,  poor hit detection, terrible dialogue, a boring and often mind-boggling story, repetitive environments and what is, quite possibly, the worst scenario design I've ever seen in a video game made by professionals. Also bugs. Dear God, bugs.\n\nLike fetch quests? Great, there are lots including gems such as, "Hey go get me those oars 25 feet away for my boat" and an inexplicable descent into the underground "Assassin Hideout" (it's actually called that) shortly thereafter en route to your destination, Venice, despite Venice being clearly visible from the prior location. It's like they wrote the story after the game.\n\nSkill trainers have no depth whatsoever and just show up randomly. "Oh hi, I'm a necromancer who will never reveal my secret skills. Oh sure I'll teach you them." "I'm a knight of a secret order I'm telling you about who cannot reveal his secrets, though I guess I could show you."\n\nThe real kicker is the main "revive" mechanic is also implemented terribly. Imagine the rewind mechanic from the Prince of Persia ps2 game. Now imagine it's completely broken. Voila, you have this game's central mechanic.\n\nYou don't have enough HP and regular enemies have too much. So you'll die, a lot. But there's a revival mechanic. Which you'll be using constantly. I suspect the devs realized their game difficulty wasn't balanced and hacked this on top of the game, because it seems like an afterthought, but I could be wrong. It ultimately winds up being gimmicky and mildly infuriating because you don't have 1 health meter, you really have one health meter and X resurrections left according to another gauge which fills by killing enemies using this one particular weapon, which is terrible and no fun to use.\n\nOh and then there are bugs. Imagine you finish finally beating the absolutely infuriating first boss and your game crashing.

The nearly universal word on Venetica is that its protagonist, Scarlett, is tremendously likable, and I agree with that statement: she's strong, courageous, not over-sexualized, and isn't in need of rescue. And, for about the first four hours, Venetica is a lot of fun, and seems to be a linear RPG of pretty high quality, with a moderately interesting combat system and a richly detailed world.\n\nThen something goes very, very wrong. What is that "something"? The city of Venice. Good god, the city of Venice. Once players reach Venice, Venetica falls flat on its face, as its story grinds to a sudden and excrutiating halt and a dozen sidequests of varying import are dropped on the player like this was an MMO and they just reached a new quest hub. After doing a few of these and realizing that the Experience rewards are negligible, the gold rewards are meaningless (because of the equipment system; it is very limited), and the overall quest structures are tedious, all players will want is to get back to the game. That overwhelming sense of "doing unrelated side ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t" does not abate, and, worse, there is no escape. There is no "getting back to the game," at least not for a good, long while.\n\nWhat starts as an interesting action RPG with fascinating characters, rich environments, and an interesting story quickly becomes a 3D Diablo clone. Go here, kill x, come back, collect y. Brave players who manage to get past this atrocious section will not feel like their time is rewarded, because it's too much of an uphill battle after, and Venetica fails to overcome the dozen hours of tedium that it just forced players to endure. Hope that there is something beyond may keep players going, but... don't let it. Venetica fails to impress.","November 8, 2015","false","0.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I'd never heard of this game, saw it when it first came to Steam; had not the funds. Finally got some monies, remembered the game, saw 't'was on sale. Bought with no more research than a skimming of the Steam store page.\n\nDo not regret it, I expect(ed) this game to turn out very well. Besides an obtuse puzzle (solution was clearly visible but had to be seen from a certain weird angle to get it), I've enjoyed every bit of playtime (as of writing this, 2.8 hours - just now got to the Windmill) (that's where the game started proving me wrong in believing I wouldn't regret it).\n\n\nBUT.\n\n\nThe game is kind of rough (as in unpolished) and, apparently, (")poorly optimized(").\n\nCombat is comparable to Fable (indeed, the whole game is Fable: The Indie Version) but the dodge mechanic is a little stiffer than I'd like (Fable probably had the same problem, but I can't recollect) and the camera is prone to zoom in too far while in combat (can toggle how close it is to you - doesn't seem to do much while in combat or in confined spaces (the Mine)); not sure if there is a way to cycle targets while locked-on to an enemy (there isn't, short of releasing and hitting the lock-on again and hope that you targeted a different enemy).\n\nPlaying with a controller, a lot of the tutorials refer to the buttons as fractions (i.e. A is 1/4, X is 1/2) - doesn't take much to figure what's what, though. The only real problem with this issue (lol) I've had is when you first get to Brawler, he wants you to dodge and counter. I couldn't do this without locking-on; it does not tell you how to. I tried LT out of habit and it worked; game told me how to do this a while later.\n\nCrashes often (playing in a certain form of XP, as opposed to Windows 7, apparently fixes this)(IDK how to do that) (read on to see the fix).\n\n\nYou have a beau who is set to go on a knightly quest. Your town is attacked. Events transpire. You discover that you are the daughter of Death; there is a group of conspirators who want to do *something* (presumably bad). You must "restore the Order."\n\n\nAs per usual, I just had to give the first impression because [insert reason].\nI recommend this game. Fans of third-person action RPG's cannot go wrong with Venetica.\n(EDIT: Fans of games that work without crippling issues should not get Venetica.)\nAlso, Scarlett doesn't seem to be some objectified female protagonist (I'm indifferent on that issue in video games, regardless, it's nice to see); the worst I've seen her degraded is cleavage (only in the initial dress)(*horrified gasp*) and her combat grunts sound... forced (I might just have that bad a mind though).\nI do not believe that my opinion will change, but, as per usual, I plan to revisit this at some point. To maybe write an actual review.\nIt's really not necessary; you should just buy Venetica.\n\nEDIT 2: ONLY CONSIDER BUYING Venetica IF YOU ARE PREPARED TO DEAL WITH SOME BOOLSH!T... SCRIPTED EVENTS ARE PRONE TO NOT WORK PROPERLY - YOU HAVE TO QUIT/LOAD THE GAME OR KILL YOURSELF AND HOPE THAT THE GAME WILL REMEMBER WHAT THE HELL IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE DOING.\nTHERE IS A GREAT GAME IN Venetica BUT, I THINK FOR US TO BE ABLE TO PLAY IT, THE DEVS WOULD HAVE TO DO A TOTAL OVERHAUL. THE SHAPE OF THE GAME IS PRETTY PITIFUL. NOT SURE I'LL ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO GET INTO THE GAME (if it's not one thing, it's another - always, right? SMH)...

Was given steps on how to fix:\nGoto C: Program files or Program files(x86) > Steam > Steamapps > common > Venetica > bin >release and scroll down the release folder to venetica.exe and Right click, at the bottom click Properties, then click the Compatability Tab and check the box Run this program in compatability mode for: Windows XP Service pack 3.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/recommended/338140/","Harley365","Harley365","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/","212 products in account","Venetica: Gold Edition (PC) Review\n\nReview for Venetica: Gold Edition on PC - on Nintendo Wii U, 3DS games review\nInitially released during the last generation of consoles, Venetica didn't find much success, though it did develop a fairly devout cult following. Years later, Venetica: Gold Edition has arrived on Steam, to grace the PC with its likable protagonist and a host of new features that really don't add much to the game, and that may have distracted the development team from fixing any of the myriad bugs, glitches, and issues. In the end, Venetica: Gold Edition doesn't alter the perception that Deck 13 Interactive had very high hopes, but didn't really know how to turn those dreams into reality.\n\nIt's telling that the nearly unanimous word on Venetica: Gold Edition is that Scarlett is a very likable protagonist. Delivering a female protagonist who stood on her own feet, never needed to be rescued, and wasn't sexualised to the point where men felt dirty just for playing (think Final Fantasy X-2), Venetica very much deserved the benefit of the doubt. That's what makes it so terribly disappointing: generally, people want to love the game, and it then does everything possible to ensure that no one does.\n\nA significant chunk of playtime consists of fighting enemies with one of four different weapon types, and combat is reminiscent of the Dark Souls games, albeit much easier. A customisable hotbar allows spells and combat manoeuvres to be used at the press of a button, but Venetica fails to provide reasons to actually use these abilities. There is a rhythm to combat, which can be learned and exploited; enemies are stunned during a combo, so Scarlett can wail on them until they die, without fear of counterattack. When there actually is a counterattack, a simple press of the Spacebar causes Scarlett to roll out of the way and only take half damage if she is struck, and then the process of smashing the enemy into jelly can resume.\n\nVenetica: Gold Edition varies between passable and great until Venice is reached, at which point everything slows to a crawl and becomes the ipso facto standard by which tedium is measured. The city is massive, nearly every door can be entered, side-quests are dropped repeatedly, and the main quest of the game falls into obscurity. The journal offers no real help on most of these quests, and tracking quests on the map is a hit-and-miss affair that sometimes fails to function at all.\n\nScreenshot for Venetica: Gold Edition on PC - on Nintendo Wii U, 3DS games review\nAll of these side-quests revolve around finding some thing or some group of things, killing them, and then returning to the person who gave the quest for a paltry amount of experience points. These quest givers might also give ducats, the in-game currency, but Scarlett doesn't have a problem finding gold and there's nothing worth purchasing anyway. To add an extra dose of realism, every slain humanoid drops its weapon (and many drop their armour), and selling these weapons provides Scarlett with all the gold she needs.\n\nOf course, no action RPG loaded to the brim with MMO-style side-quests would be complete without an inconsequential levelling system, and Venetica: Gold Edition certainly has one of those: in fact, it's so irrelevant that it's easy to forget levels have been gained, resulting in stat points not being distributed until a dozen of them has been done. At each new level, thirty Skill Points (SP) and three Ability Points are earned. The Skill Points are used at different vendors to purchase new melee or magical skills, and the Ability Points are used to increase one of Scarlett's primary attributes, such as Strength or Wisdom. Whether these have any impact on combat is anyone's guess, but it certainly seems that the stat changes don't have any noticeable effect. The same is true of the spells: aside from the moments when the plot requires a specific spell be used, none of the magic is ever worthwhile.\n\nVenetica: Gold Edition is extremely disappointing, and that's without getting into the frequent crashes. Talking to a particular merchant might cause a crash, opening the menu during a cut-scene might cause a crash, and any number of random acts might also cause a crash. It is advised to save frequently, which makes the lack of a Quick Save button more lamentable than it otherwise would be.\nScreenshot for Venetica: Gold Edition on PC - on Nintendo Wii U, 3DS games review\n\nGameplay\n\nFor the first few hours, Venetica: Gold Edition has really awesome gameplay, but then Venice is reached and the game falls on its face. Too many side-quests bombard far too quickly, and the NPCs rarely provide enough information to make completing the side-quest possible without tracking the quest on a map, while the quest tracking feature doesn't always work. Knowing only that the NPC being pursued by Scarlett "ran through the market" leaves the player in a state of total bewilderment at the size and scope of Venice, and the main quest is quickly swept to the wayside by a deluge of side quests. Continuing to play becomes a chore.\n\nGraphics\n\nVenetica: Gold Edition is from the last generation of consoles, with a bit of side content added and a few small changes here and there. As such, the graphics are pretty dated, but, since Deck 13 Interactive used an art style for characters that is similar to old Disney films, characters have mostly escaped from this and still come out looking good, particularly Scarlett, who had a great deal of effort put into her appearance.\nSound\n\nThe voice actor for Scarlett did a fantastic job, but much of the voice acting is also reminiscent of old Disney films. The soundtrack is generic fantasy music, and there are no pieces that really grab attention or stand out. Sound effects are satisfying and deliver exactly the experience they should, almost allowing the feeling of when an enemy blocks an attack.\n\nValue\n\nIf inconsequential side-quests that distract from the main story, rather than complementing the main quest, are desired, then Venetica: Gold Edition is as good as any action RPG out there. That so many of these side-quests could have been ripped right out of World of Warcraft is a problem of its own, but there are quite a lot of them. Whether this translates to "content" is really up to the individual and their tolerance for random "Go kill x" quests. Without these things detracting from the experience, the game would be much more enjoyable, but the city of Venice causes Venetica: Gold Edition to degrade into a mess of random MMO-like kill quests with paltry rewards and little point.\n\n4/10\nRated 4 out of 10\nPOOR\n\nAbout this score\nVenetica: Gold Edition could have done a lot of good for the gaming world, and it's all the more remarkable because Deck 13 Interactive brought Venetica long before "Gamergate" and long before large discussions regarding the portrayal of females in gaming. For this, Deck 13 Interactive deserves applause. For this, Venetica: Gold Edition deserved the chance to impress, to dazzle, and to amaze. Sadly, it fails spectacularly, becoming a lacklustre action RPG full of boring, uninspired side-quests that even someone with Scarlett's charisma can't overcome.","July 3, 2015","false","2.4"," 10 of 24 people (42%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","42","10","24","2","1"

When you try to edit the command , you press Z and it write Y ... and with the controller , it says " press A to pick up stuff " ... you have to use LB . I'm sorry ... nice to make the game in french , but sorry , doesn't work at all . So i will put a thumb down , and tomorrow , i will try the game in english , if the game works , i wont change my decision , cause that means you had never check the game in french for the last 5 years ( sorry , maybe the french language was made on later ) .\nHope for next french player , you will make an effort.\nThanks by advance.\n\nEDIT 1 : So , i try to put the game in english ... So , i did it on the proprities of the game , result : stil in french. I change my steam in english , result : Still in french.

The intro almost put me off, but after getting past that, I found the game highly enjoyable. The story is rather interesting and the mechanics both well-functioning and intuitive. Anyone who likes RPG games in general will likely also like this game.\nSomething I really was thrilled to see was that different merchants offered different prices on some items, so I'd have to actually consider which merchant to go to instead of just going past the first one (at least when trying to get the most coin).\nThe quest and skill system is easy to use and some of the fights will require you to consider which weapon or strategy is most appropriate. So my view is that it's a good game for decent money (I got it on sale, but having played the game, I think it is fully worth the usual price as well).\nThe one issue I have with the game is that it tends to stop responding on occation while loading, but it may be my computer/system instead of the game.","December 30, 2015","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
