I'm not a perfectionist, so, I breezed through it pretty quickly (most of my playtime was waiting for card drops), but, everything from the humor, to the level design, to the sound effects, to the brilliant touch-screen integration, to the puzzles themselves, was perfect. I've recommended this game to several of my friends, and now recommend it to you.\n\nCheers!\n\n8/10\n\n-Keero","May 16","true","9.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You would think it's about time he should lose some weight...BUT NOPE!! You have to help him grab some high-calorie-looking cupcakes too.\n\nThe game has simple but elegant graphics. The music is pretty nice. It features hudreds of intriguing levels and should keep you entertained for some hours.\n\nOverall, I recommend this for the casual gamers.","February 29","true","3.8"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","52","12","23","7","0"

It takes some of the best elements from all of the different genres. The intense action and threat of death makes games like cs go and gta look like care bears. the character development and storyline is the most deeply engadging and hooking scripts ive ever come across, far superior to a game like the last of us. The journey i have undertaken with my character has been one of the most memorable experiences of my life. I felt myself felling so deeply attached to my character that i lost hundredes of hours of sleep developing my incredibly detailed and insightfully crafted character. This game is simply an essential to any steam players library and if you dont already have this game then go jump off a ♥♥♥♥ing cliff ♥♥♥♥","April 10","true","12.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

And doing it to a spoof of the mission impossible theme is just annoying...\n\nI got this game because I had a 90% discount code, even with that I find it hard to recommend. It's not a "bad" game by any means but it will start getting on your nerves fast!","March 17","false","4.0"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/genkipro/recommended/447890/","genkipro","genkipro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/genkipro/","2517 products in account","NOTE: This game was given to me by the developer for review purposes. This did not influence my review in any way.\n\n==========================================================\n---------------------------------------OVERVIEW-------------------------------------\n==========================================================Cat on a Diet is a casual level-by-level puzzle game that plays like a cross between the Incredible Machine and Angry Birds.\n\nThe goal of each level is to manoeuvre the obese cat of the title, Dr. Meow, into a cookie jar (or other appropriate container). But you can't directly control the lazy feline; instead you exert your influence on the various platforms and devices in the level in order to allow the world physics to drop, bounce, and roll our squishy hero towards his tasty goal.\n\nAlthough only just released on Steam, the game has been available on mobile platforms for a couple of years.\n\n==========================================================\n----------------------------------------QUALITY-------------------------------------\n==========================================================Graphics - Graphics are big and colourful, with a consistent cartoony style. Colouring is mostly a bit washed out, with grainy-looking textures, giving each level the feel of a movie set or similar: an effect that I can only assume was deliberate, as it works to good effect.\n\nEach of the four areas includes a short, partly animated introductory comic, but these are really just a short distraction from the game proper. Dr. Meow is suitably plump and he squishes, flattens, and bends in amusing and satisfying ways when contacting the various parts of each level.\n\nThere are other nice touches, too, like cute animated appearances of little creatures in the background, and Dr. Meow getting bored and going to sleep -- complete with an endless stream of Zs floating away from his head -- when you leave the game alone for too long. The game also includes a large number of costumes for Dr. Meow hidden throughout the game. These don't seem to have any in-game effects, but some are quite cute or funny, and they're a nice graphical addition to the game. There are also a lot of them; I count 80 in the game's wardrobe section.\n\nGraphics options are almost non-existent, and simply come down to this: "Will that be full screen or window, madam?"\n\nSound - Sound is pretty minimal. There's a forgettable, but mostly unannoying music track, and basic, but suitable sound effects. Dr. Meow is strangely quiet throughout the game, thereby missing a potential opportunity for some nice cat sound effects.\n\nGameplay - The game consists of four areas in Dr. Meow's house, each with (I believe) 24 levels.\n\nEach level begins with Dr. Meow seated somewhere away from his cookie-container goal, and three muffins positioned in mostly inconvenient positions around the level. Your job is to use as few swipes of the mouse as possible to cut items in the level (e.g. ropes, or wooden beams), activate simple devices, or otherwise manipulate the level's obstacles in such a way that the world physics move Dr. Meow to his desired cookies, preferably collecting all three muffins on the way. Later levels include movers and dangerous devices that can harm Dr. Meow, making your task far more difficult.\n\nUp to three stars are awarded upon completion of a level: one for completion of the level itself, one for collecting all three muffins, and one for using no more than the stated maximum mouse swipes (or 'cuts') for that level. Completing a level with three stars awards you one of three special bonus powers: a muffin magnet, which draws nearby muffins towards you; a soap bubble, which encases Dr. Meow and allows you to move him about by clicking on or near the bubble; and a shield, which protects Dr. Meow from any dangers present on the level. Once you've collected one of these powers it can be used on any level by clicking its icon.\n\nThere's also a collection of bonus levels that are unlocked by collecting the stars. I've only played the first nine of these so far, and these have all involved moving a bubble-encased Dr. Meow around the level by clicking, trying to collect three muffins before the time runs out. These are a nice distraction for a few minutes if you get stuck on one of the normal levels.\n\n==========================================================\n-------------------------------------PROS & CONS------------------------------------\n==========================================================Pros:\n+ Simple and easy to get into\n+ Cute and colourful graphics, with some nice added touches to add interest\n+ Steam Achievements to help keep you motivated\n+ Trading Cards\n\nCons:\n- It gets repetitive fairly quickly, especially in the early levels when there's not much going on, and when you keep retrying a level to get that cut just right\n\n==========================================================\n--------------------------------------CONCLUSION-----------------------------------\n==========================================================If you like casual puzzle games then Cat on a Diet should keep you busy for a while, especially if you're also a Steam Achievement hunter.\n\n7/10\nFor more recommendations by LL's Game Giveaways and Reviews on quality indie games or ones with high potential follow our group curations here!","March 12","true","3.0"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","7","16","2","0"
