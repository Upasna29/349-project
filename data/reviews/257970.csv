Their backgrounds are pre-defined, and both have access to the same skills.  Who you pick determines mostly how certain NPCs react to you (some may mistrust elves, for example) and what your romantic options are.\n\n* Yes, there are romantic options in all flavors.  Up until the very last screen of the romance, there's nothing risque - just a bunch of meaningul campfire scenes between you and your beloved (kind of like Dragon Age Origins).  The last screen of the romances tends to be a little racy, but it's easy enough to click through it in a microsecond if you wish.  Each completed romance also gets a rather sweet scene or two in the epilogue.\n\n* Combat is turn-based, and reminds me of the old-style Wizardry games.  The screenshots give you a pretty good idea of what it looks like.  There's a priority system to attacks, with fast characters going first, slower ones second, etc.  Each attack or spell lengthens your wait timer by a different amount.  The end result is surprisingly intuitive.\n\n* There are a ton of excellent skills to play with.  Each character gets two skill trees.  The first one is fighter, mage or rogue, and shared with other characters of that class.  In my playthrough, I seldom put points there.  Instead, I focused on the far more interesting second skill tree, which is peculiar to each character.  There you find things like Assassination, Dark Magic, Nature Magic, Berserker, Martial Arts, etc.  There's enough variety and 'oh, neat!' factors to keep you experimenting with them for hours.\n\n* Though simple-looking, combat is strategic. You need to juggle placement (fighters up front, ranged in the back, etc.), status effects, buffs, debuffs, attacks with various AoE shapes (all enemies, just a column, just a row), and a Pokemon-like strength and weakness system ('You cast rainstorm at Fire Demon - it's super effective!').\n\n* Let's talk loot. There's a lot of it here.  You can find it by defeating enemies, solving quests or buying it at a shop.  Shop prices drop as your reputation in each region rises, so it pays to complete non-plot-related tasks in the towns that produce your favorite plate armor, etc.  Each of your followers has a loyalty quest, just like in Mass Effect or Dragon Age.  If you finish it, not only will you have learned more about your companion, but you'll have a powerful piece of equipment they alone can wear.\n\n* Speaking of Dragon Age, the story here is similar in outline to that of Origins: an ancient evil has resurfaced, but the factions that could take it down are too busy bickering with each other, and it's up to your band  of adventurers to earn the respect and confidence of each region in order to unite them for a common offensive.  It's a solid framework that kept me entertained for the 10+ hours I played - not once did I feel like skipping through a text box or chat bubble.\n\n* Which reminds me.... the characters are not entirely silent.  You'll hear their battle cries and comments in combat.  It's a nice touch, but be aware that most of the rest of the game is text-based.\n\nThe first time I clicked 'play' it was early evening, and I 'just wanted to try it out'.  I figured I'd do the tutorial, see if there were any glaring errors or red flags, then shut it off and go do something else.  Didn't happen.\n\nInstead, I found myself glued to the screen until 6:30 AM.  This is a really, really good game, folks, and if you're into old-school Wizardry-style RPGS with memorable characters, you should definitely give this one a try.\n\n\n\n","January 15, 2014","true","13.6"," 484 of 537 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","484","537","0","9"

As a woman gamer, this is really rare! But Loren presents two interesting backstories to choose from and those backstories really do influence how others treat your character and the dialogue options you have.\n\nSo, to back up: this is basically a low-fi version of Dragon Age. It's heavily story driven, with several interesting characters, tons of dialogue and interaction, huge amounts of world-building, lots of really cool and diverse types of female characters, realistic conflict between characters, and Loren manages to do it all without BioWare's budget or AAA status. The character designs are really cool (Dora and Chambara are probably my favorites) and once I realized (about 5 hours into the game, whoops!) there was a "fast combat" option in the menu to speed things up, the classic turn-based combat made me fairly nostalic. My big complaint with the game would probably be the skill trees, partially because for strength-based (warriors) characters most of the skills were useless and for will (mages) and skill-based (thieves) the skills were often unbalanced and there's never a marker to tell you when/how you can gain certain skills (is it progression? A certain level of will? What? Why can I NEVER pick that skill?). It gets frustrating, particularly at higher levels, as the skill points you receive are minimal throughout the game.\n\nRegardless of my frustration with the skill trees (and by about hour 7 I just gave up and started auto-assigning), Loren's definitely one of the better RPGs I've played recently. I'm looking forward to the other playthroughs I intend to do to see alternate paths, romances, and endings.","October 11, 2014","true","13.2"," 120 of 134 people (90%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","90","120","134","5","0"

For once you do not play as the namesake of the game, but her servant - a "lowly" male by the Amazon's standard, or a female elf (both slaves), accompanying her to go rescue her mother. You make some choices about your past actions and here you go for your stats boost. And the whole thing is very verbose, as promised.\nProblem being that for a game mostly a visual novel (the RPG aspect is just there to flesh out a bit the adventure), the story is too standard. After rescuing Loren's mother, you learn that Evil lurks. And yes, once again, it's an Evil that was already vanquished in the past, but as everyone know, there's not a soul in the multiverse able to properly seal any evil being whatsoever. Fost, said Evil is uninteresting and clich√©.\nLet's be honest, for the game's lenght, the background is detailed enough, but still... Too classic. Elves antagonizing humans, orcs, dwarves, dark elves, demons aplenty, lizardmen, etc., things we have seen a bijillion times before. And if there are some talks about tolerance and all that, do not expect much subtelty from the plot, neither originality. Gather all the nations, go to the Big Bad's lair, insert fights, slay said Big Bad, get the girl, the end.\n\nNow the dialogs are quite decent, and some characters are delightful, like the female dwarf Dora (beg yer pardon, totally not a thief !) or the snarky dark witch Chambara. For what I saw, the romances are pleasant too- up to six possibilities, and yes, you can flirt with characters of the same gender as yours.\nConcerning the dialog options, you will have three most of the time : joking, friendly or forceful. Of course other people will react differently depending on your choices, I couldn't estimate if having a majority in one kind really forged a real reputation, but that may very well be.\n\nAnd where does the gameplay fit in all this ? Well, you'll have a great number of fights, six VS six at maximum, with some scripted ones (like having only two members in your roster). Back row cannot be targeted by melee attacks while there are still at least one unit in the front row, wich make it ideal for missile units (bow/magic). On your right you can see in what order characters and ennemies will act, then plan accordingly. There are three classes (warrior, thief, mage), and each of your characters has a skill tree rendering him unique, like the druid being able to cast a heal spell on all a row.\nThieves can use mana for special arrows (fire, ice...), warriors can force an enemy to switch position with one on the back row, etc. Insert potions when needed.\nAll in all it plays smoothly, but I really fail to see the claim of the developers : there's nothing hardcore in it. If anything, it's quite casual and simple, not much strategy is involved. Money and equipment are not being scarce, the game is quite easy. Towns have an infinite amount of replayable tasks for money, XP and discount at the local shop ; making the possibility of skipping the odd random encounters sound.\n\nNow, I'm one of those stressing the value of story over gameplay for RPG, a reason why Planescape Torment is one of my eternal favorites. But I must insist : the game's intrigue has been seen too often to really be epic. The lack of artworks is rather grueling in that regard, many scenes would have benefited from a dedicated drawing to better depict them. Decently fleshed out characters (the personal quests help) cannot alone bring all the appeal. This not to say a simple story is something bad, here, it's just lacking in a genre where it should shine.\n\nOne great flaw is the DLC. I do not know about you, but 17 buckazoids is already a bit steep a price. 6‚Ç¨ for content which could (and should) have been in the vanilla game is a blatant rip-off. You'll even get a message in the base game stating that you could recruit Chambara and a certain monk, but, hey, show the money first ! Worse, those two characters can have a crucial impact on the game's ending, wich is just wrong.\n\nAnd as for the replay value ? Yes, you can still change the starting character, romance other people, make a few other choices... But is it really worth going back to the same story without any surprise ? The game itself is not sure of that, as you can skip all the dialogs you want, and have cheat mode enabling you to win all the battles once you have completed the game for the first time.\n\nI was intrigued by the aspect of Loren the Amazon Princess at the start and still enjoyed it. It made me think of a Fighting Fantasy gamebook with actual character development.\nBut if you are tempted, my advise would be to wait for a special promotion like -50%. 14 hours-ish of a classic plot (DLC accounted for) with marginal gameplay and satisfying protagonists are just not enough to be worthy of such a price. "Two novel's worth of in-game text", by the way, is quite meaningless : are we talking 100-ish pages sized novels, or Stephen King's sized novels ?","January 18, 2014","false","15.4"," 192 of 249 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","192","249","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/toad004/recommended/257970/","toad004","toad_004","http://steamcommunity.com/id/toad004/","199 products in account","I hate overly positive reviews. The entire review scale on most websites has been shifted because these incarnations of Pollyanna insist on giving everything 10s. Just the thought that 3/5 or 5/10 isn't considered "average" makes me want to extract vengeance on the endless parade of perfect scores. Now that I have adequately set myself up as hypocrite of the year, let's begin the review.\n\nThis game is about Loren, who happens to be the princess of the Amazons (yes, I am Captain Obvious, and I'm going for promotion - I like the sound of "Major Obvious"). Going against all gaming tropes, she doesn't get kidnapped, nor do you play as her. Loren: The Amazon Princess begins with the titular character decapitating some training dummies, then berating her slaves for failing to provide more. She is then quickly informed that her mother (the Queen) did not return and is presumed dead. Loren rejects this and embarks on a mission to save her mother, but the captain manages to force Loren to take the Amazon's most prized slave - that's you.\n\nThis game's greatest strength is its characters. Sure, Loren may be a terrifying-dual-sword-wielding-badass, but she's also never left the citadel before, and it shows. Within an hour of starting the game, she will have demanded to speak to the Queen of a republic, choked a bartender for the crime of ignoring her, and referred to the Amazons as better than all other nations. Other characters are no less entertaining, as you meet characters like Draco Firestarter - a fire mage who likes to start fires (am I a major yet?) and manages to cause the rest of the party to burst out laughing every time he talks, or Dora the explorer nicest thief in town - she teaches that the best way to make friends is to give them money.\n\nThis does lead me to one of this game's few flaws - while the dialogue is well written all around, you have little insight into what your character will say. Every dialogue choice you make is one of four options - Joking, Friendly, or Forceful - and occasionally Romance. While the latter always progresses that character's romance, the first three aren't very clear on what you're about to say. For example, early in the game you arrive in a nearby city and Loren insults it. Your response? Joking, Friendly, or Forceful, without any indication on whether an option agrees with Loren or not. The only surefire way is to save before you choose, then pick every option and see which you'd prefer.\n\nThe graphics are a matter of taste - this game isn't meant to melt your GPU to your motherboard. Many of the reviews seem to hate the graphics, I personally enjoy the graphics. The only graphical issue is with a few of the backgrounds - I noticed stairs leading up to a castle tower looked exactly the same as stairs to an inn's rooms. Minor, but a little strange. Overall though, I'd suggest looking at screenshots and seeing for yourself if you like the graphics. I really don't suggest deciding to purchase (or not) a game based on graphics.\n\nThe gameplay is fairly straightforward if you've played RPGs before - everyone is either a warrior, a thief, or a mage, and you've got Strength, Skill, and Will to put points in. Certain enemies might be weak against or resistant to certain elements (you used typhoon on fire demon! It's Super Effective!). However, there are a few gameplay elements that aren't self-explanatory, and they aren't explained to you either. For example - dual-wielding carries a penalty (except on Loren, who has a skill to remove this penalty). However, if you wield a dagger in the offhand, you aren't penalized - the game never actually tells you this. It also doesn't bother clarifying stats such as "Attack" , "Damage" (aren't they the same thing?) and "threshold" (I still have no clue that this does).\n\nThe vast majority of modern games have a few places at which you can choose a different path - and it almost always comes across as a failed attempt to get the player to play the game again. This is one of the few games where it actually works - once I finished the game, I was ready to start over with another character right then and there. Very few games have such replay value, but many of the choices you make actually give you a different story for a while.\n\nThis is one of those rare titles that actually appeals to gamers that care about characters and story, rather than running 4096x2160 at 120fps, or shooting everything you see with generic guns and getting racial slurs in return. If this type of game doesn't appeal to you, then go download Duty of Calling: Fieldbattle 12. But if you care the slightest about deep characters or a game that can pull you into its world, then I can't recommend this more.","April 29, 2014","true","23.7"," 64 of 71 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","64","71","2","1"

Keep in mind that that this is pretty much a visual novel with some RPG elements/combat tossed in.\n\nPros:\n- Fun, casual gameplay\n- Catchy soundtrack\n- Artwork isn't bad\n- Male/Female playable characters\n- Many romance options\n- Random encounters are skippable (as opposed to having to "flee")\n- Combat system is interesting and relatively intuitive\n- Many different classes and characters to fight with, all with a broad range of usable weapons and armor\n- Cheat mode to skip combat after beating the game once, to view different endings more quickly\n\nNeutral:\n- There is A LOT of dialogue, and there are plenty of times where somebody repeats what they already said to you to another character\n- Elemental weapons are an option, but they aren't entirely useful due to enemy resistances; you're better off using normal type weapons for consistent damage and leaving the elemental attacks to the mages' spells\n- Some unique boss drops can be purchased in shops, for some reason\n\nCons:\n- As previousy discussed, the price tag\n- Story isn't anything new or special\n- Cliche/annoying character personalities\n- Can only romance one character per playthrough\n- Only one or two background images for each location, plus a few common ones that get recycled (tomb, forest, etc)\n- A few continuity problems with the dialogue depending on your previous choices/the order in which you choose to do things (like when Dora exclaims her fear of Death Knights and how she has never seen one/hopes to never see one, despite having already battled one)\n- Combat mechanics don't seem to work consistently; sometimes using Taunt III will increase your aggro by 30%, other times by 4% (and the enemies will attack somebody else anyway)\n- There are fights that require certain characters to be used, which can be annoying if you don't usually use that character and they are underleveled/poorly equipped as a result\n- There is a severe lack of cloth/padded pants and belts in the shops; Dora and Draco were bottomless for the entirety of my playthrough\n\nOverall, it's an enjoyable little game to waste some time on, but wait for a sale.","October 16, 2015","true","8.5"," 51 of 62 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","51","62","2","0"

It could have been a bit stronger, more dramatic or so, honestly.\n\nAlthough I'm not entirely sure, I'm giving this a thumbs down because I think the price is too high.

This makes figuring out the dialogue choice less tedious, although it still is annoying to have to select and then back out of each option.\n\nTo give you an idea of how bad these dialogue options are, lets do a scenario.  Person A Is arguing with Person B.  They turn to you for your thoughts.  Your options are Joking, Friendly, or Forceful as always, without giving you any indication of who those options side with.  It's only through saving and reloading 3 times that you learn  Joking and Forceful side with Person A, and Friendly sides with Person B.  Very tedious.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GameDragonZero/recommended/257970/","GameDragonZero","GameDragonZero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GameDragonZero/","77 products in account","I got curious about this game when I saw the idea of fusing RPGs and visual novels.  Though I've seen the mechanic a few times, "Loren" seemed to focus on doing "more" with both of its parents.\n\nI can't call the game an insta-buy at $19.99 -  it's going to depend on wether it's for you.  Me, a person who likes his RPGs with loot, skills, story, and choices (and now and then likes a game that you can sit down with for 30 minutes or 2 hours), thinks he got his money's worth.  It is definitely a replayable game as well, so if you're the kind of person that likes to try different endings and plots, then that's a plus.  I found a full playthrough is about 10 hours (winning unlocks  cheat mode)\n\n"Loren" is the story of an amazon princess who's mother vanishes, presumed dead, and promptly gives up her queenship to find her.  She's given a single slave to help her - that's you by the way - and very quickly you're necessary as Loren is essentially a niave, unsubtle, combat machine.  Very quickly Loren and your chosen hero/heroine (who you do get some customization of) end up caught up in wars and intrigue, and collect a ragtag bunch of somewhat familiar characters.  So it's off to battle orcs, lizardmen, demons, and more because the world's problems are a LOT bigger than a missing queen  . . .\n\nThe game mixes visual novel style branching storylines and classic "Camp" dialogue with point-and-click maps and classic RPG combat.  It actually balances all of these pretty well - most events are "bite sized", combats don't drag on for long, and there's a pleasing level of detail in things like equipment, character development, and battle strategy.  If you're an accomplished RPG player you probably won't find "Normal" too hard, though there are moments that will push you - you do have to pay attention.\n\nThe best part of the combat and character building are how different factors interact - Status effects are a big part of the game, and soon you'll be trying to figure the best way to put your foes off guard.  Classes are meant to work together, especially in boss battles - and every character is "dual classes" with a generic class and a specialty class, adding a nice bit of customazation to the usual trinity of Warrior-Mage-Theif.  In short you're always "this basic class and . . ."\n\nThe story is the big selling point, and frankly, "Loren" delivers a giant heaping helping of common fantasy elements and characters that we're all familiar with (perhaps too much), but then actually goes the distance to add little personal details that bring the characters and events to life.  Sure the prose has a purple tinge, and some elements border on stereotype, but it's fun and you'll find a few surprises - you actually get a nice amount of character backstory if you dive into it, as well as interesting romantic complications.  There are parts that will definitely pull at your heartstrings, and I found myself geniunely liking some of the cast.\n\nSo a buy?  I'd say if you like your RPGs with story, want a good RPG you can play in short bursts or long sessions, and if something a bit experimental like this appeals, go for it.  I think this is also a game to encourage, because the fusion is quite satisfying - and I'd like to see more.","January 26, 2014","true","11.9"," 32 of 38 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","32","38","0","0"

For once, you don't even play as the title character- instead, you play the second banana- either a human male slave, or an elven female.  The character you choose may have different observations about certain scenarios, and they may have a different set of people they might start a relationship with, but to be quite obvious, that's all the difference between them.  Both the male or female characters can get the same moves and the same classes, so really the only thing you're getting is a different view of the world.\n\nCombat is actually very well-handled- you just place your characters, and go.  Their turn comes up, you pick a skill or an item to use, and then you repeat until the combat is done.  You'll always have a healer on hand, because whatever you pick for your character- gender or class- you get a class of Healer right off the bat.\n\nAs far as the story, it's actually well-written, and the characters have their own personalities.   You can talk to them in camp, you can flirt with a certain few of them, and if your scores are high enough, you'll even end up having to make a choice in a lovers' triangle between two party members- or maybe even more. There are both gay and straight options for both male and female characters- even more than Dragon Age, for crying out loud, and that's saying something.\n\nThere's even a bit of DLC, which unlocks four more party members and expands the third chapter with an entire new area.  It is completely worth it, no matter what.\n\nFinally, a bit of warning:  Yes, the Steam version is the toned-down version.  There's a wokaround that you can use, but fair warning- this does create some NSFW scenes in the story, and changes some of the outfits on characters.  Take it as you will.\n\nAll in all, I would play this again and again and again, unlike some full-price console games and the like.

This may not be worth the full $20 price it's starting at--but, it's certainly an enjoyable game w/ much going for it.  Even the soundtrack is worth keeping on during play.\n\nOverall, the dialog is both detailed and brief enough to keep the story interesting and enjoyable.  The choices in action and dialogue do have somewhat of an impact in the progress of the story.  But, having played a bit more at this point, I'd have to say most of it is just 'when' you see events, rather than true story impacts.  The 'camp' dialogues are limited in player options for responses (Joking, Friendly, Forceful, and the occasional [Romantic]) w/ fairly obvious outcomes from each.  It gives the feel of relationship development, but at a graphic novel level rather than actually giving a role playing experience.\n\nThe fact that you play a supporting role instead of the lead is a refreshing twist on the entire experience.  This may even be worth a replay to see what different choices may accomplish.  But, the story follows a fairly straightforward direction.  It is a standard high fantasy tale worth your attention if you're looking for a lunchtime break that includes some playable strategic combat, predictable but enjoyable 'relationship' elements, and dialogue that is decent and not excessive.\n\nFor the record, please don't rate this down just b/c you think the game's not epic.  I'm not saying it's a Bioware title.  I'm saying, it's a decent $10/$15 game that is worth spending some lunch hours on.\n\nHope this helps!","January 15, 2014","true","26.8"," 80 of 124 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","80","124","0","0"

As someone who is not particularly well-versed at RPG's, I was pleased that the battle system was easy to learn and navigate, and the battles themselves were well placed throughout the storyline. With a mix of RPG, visual novel and dating sim aspects, I was never bored and while the story might seem pretty cliche, I think the characters and their individual stories were what really made this game enjoyable for me. Once I started playing, I found it hard to quit.\n\nThe art style was simple and while some may complain that some of the backgrounds were overused, I found that to be part of the simple charm. Chances are, if you're concentrating more on the backgrounds than the story, this game probably isn't for you.\n\nAs an added bonus, the story had great continuity and the characters each had their own personality and quirks.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/duszynski/recommended/257970/","duszynski","A Star in Darkness","http://steamcommunity.com/id/duszynski/","155 products in account","This game quickly became one of my Top 5 Favorite Games on Steam. It's a JRPG-style game from an non-Japanese indie game company named Winter Wolves. This company is mostly known for dating sims and visual novels, but honestly, I think this game is their best yet. (Although, to be fair, I haven't played all their games yet.)\n\nImportant note: The DLC is a MUST HAVE. Honestly, the story would seem very incomplete without it, so if you get this game, get the DLC. This review is also based on having it.\n\nWhile this is definitely a RPG, the fact that a lot of their games are visual novels definitely shows in the design. There is zero action in the turn-based battles. In fact, they rely solely on pictures to represent what takes place in the battle. For a lot of people, this is a flaw, but for me, I was indifferent to this type of gameplay. What was important was that the game was fun to play.\n\nIt took me roughly 20 or so hours to get through the game the first time. This is considered short for a RPG, but it has potential for several playthroughs. Personally, I went through 13 playthroughs, going for all the achievements. It can get a bit repetitive going through the game that many times, but thankfully, the creators realized this; there is a cheat mode that enables "story mode" in which the player automatically wins every battle, which can get you through the game much quicker. Obviously, the game is story-driven, which is a big highlight to me. The story is definitely influenced by Lord of the Rings. I can't blame for that, LotR is awesome. However, there are a couple of races that do not exist in the LotR world that exist in this game. Another 1-up this game has is that there's an even distribution of gender between the characters, unlike the sausagefest that is LotR.\n\nThere is a bit of a dating sim element to this game, but you can actually get through the game without romancing anyone (in fact, there's an achievement for that). There are several people the main character can romance, which is what gives the game the potential for several playthroughs. Each one has its own unique effect on the story.\nKudos to the creators for allowing same-sex coupling, which is a reoccurring thing in the Winter Wolves games.\n\nSort of spoiler-ish, but not really:\nThere are also a few different ways to end the game. Ultimately, the Death Knight (main villain) is defeated in each ending, but how you defeat him depends on things you do in the game. I looked up which way is canon out of curiosity, but ultimately, it's up to the player to decide how the Death Knight should meet his "fate." There's also a pretty heavy hint at the end of the game that there will be a sequel.\n\nFlaws:\n- There are absolutely no people of color in this game. White people EVERYWHERE; there isn't even a NPC that has a shade or two. And no, blue-skinned dark elves do not count. I mean realistic people of color.\n- The game could do without so much sexualization of the characters, particularly the women. It isn't really necessary that they be half-naked, especially when they're supposed to be fighting in a war.\n- I found one technical error in the game. In each town/village, there's a shop and a fame score. The player can earn fame by doing tasks for that particular town/village. Well, sometimes, if you go to a shop in a town/village that has no fame score yet, it'll re-direct to a previous shop. For example, while I was playing, I went to the elves' village's shop and it was linking me to the Citadel's shop. However, once I earned some fame in the elves' village, it correctly went to their shop. This error can actually benefit the player, so it isn't a huge deal.\n\nDespite its flaws, I definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes RPGs, especially if they enjoy story-driven games and visual novels / dating sims.","November 16, 2014","true","111.5"," 29 of 38 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","29","38","0","0"

The game promises vivid characters, a strong plot, and meaningful decisions but delivers none of the above. A demon lord, who looks like someone traced a picture of Sauron off a Lord of the Rings DVD box, wants to take over the world. You must convince each race (elves, dwarves, humans etc.) to fight the demon by completing a task for them (killing something.) It's the plot of Dragon Age without the nuance and well written dialog. Writing your own "backstory" consists of choosing whether you were a stable slave or a castle slave in order to get either thief or warrior stats. Customization is extremely limited. For instance, the thief talent tree is 20 different ranks of inflicting a status condition on a staggered enemy. Overall this was a simplistic and boring game with simplistic and boring characters. It feels unfinished, since they clearly meant for the player to be able to choose to be a mage and they made the romance option nothing more than pressing a big button with the word "(romance)" on it. I can't help but think that this is a placeholder for real dialog that they never got around to writing. Don't let the word "novel" trick you into thinking that there is a good story to be had.","February 4, 2014","false","7.3"," 33 of 47 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","33","47","0","2"

Let's be clear about that, but it has some flaws that detract from it's fun factor (for me anyways).\n\nThe graphics are good - about what you'd expect for this genre of game.\n\nThere's a lot of story. It's not badly written, but it's not best seller material either - again, about average for the genre.\n\nI do like that there are places where the plot diverges - I haven't put in enough time to see if it's just a case of B then A, instead of A then B, or if it's a permanent change to the game.\n\n\nMy main complains with the game have to do with the combat system .Since that's the main point of the game other than the story, I consider them pretty serious issues.\n\nFirst, I'll explain the skill system. Each "skill tree" consists of 6 or 7 skills, each of which has 3 levels and some skills require other skills to unlock. Each character has 2 skill trees available. Every character has one of 3 basic class trees (mage, thief, warrior) and their own class tree of unique skills.\n\nSome skills seem almost pointless. Others seem very counter intuitive.\n\nExample of a pointless skill - from the basic class FIghter tree.\n\nPower Strike (Lvl 1/2/3) - activate to do (15%/30%/45%) extra damage but lose (10%/20%/30%) speed for (3/4/5) turns.\n\nSo at level 1 it does 15% extra damage but you attack 10% slower for 3 turns. So each turn will take 1.1 'time' than normal.\n\nThe 3 attacks take 3.3 'time' to complete to do 3.45 'attacks worth' of damage. Sounds like a *small* bonus. But activating the skill takes about 0.33 'time' of an attack - so it's actually 3.63 'time' for 3.45 'attacks worth' of damage. In addition it costs you stamina to cast it. Also, if you use any of those turns to do something other than attack, you're just taking a slow turn with no benefits.  These type of skills would have been much more useful if designed as single turn attacks with a smaller stamina cost.\n\nA skill that seems counter-intuitive\n\nThe Archmage tree is basically 5 (6?) elemental types. Each skill is an AOE attack with a chance of a status effect (burn for fire, freeze for water, etc).\n\nAs you increase the level of the skill, you DECREASE the damage the attack does but you increase the chance of the status effect kicking in.\n\nAt level 1 - all the skills do 300% base damage and have a 10% or 30% (depends on the status) for the status to take effect.\nAt level 2 - it's 250% damage and 20 or 40%\nAt level 3 - it's 200% damage and 30 or 50%\n\nAgain, it's not that combat is awful,  it's just many of the skills seem.. less useful than they could be.\n\nPerhaps I wouldn't be so critical of the skill system had I never played Monster's Den and Monster's Den:Book of Dread - free games on Kongregate that use the same combat style but with much more interesting and varied skills.\n\n\nThe other problem is grinding. Each town has 3 grind battles available. As far as I can tell, each of these battles is always the same with zero variety in creatures (so fighting undead in the dark elf town means 3 skelly fighters, 2 skelly archers, 1 necro... never 3 archers or 2 necros and an archer.. never ANY variety.\n\nI don't know that I find the story compelling enough to complete the game when the combat system is so.... static and repetitive compared to other games I've played with the combat system.\n\n","February 7, 2014","false","20.4"," 21 of 29 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","21","29","0","2"

This game has been out for a while outside of Steam. No, I am not some paid review, or bot or anything of the sort. Please stop downvoting this review because you think its not legit. Look it up, and you'll see this game isn't exactly new.\n\nThis game is absolutely amazing. How amazing? I've never been compelled to write a Steam review for anything I've ever played before. But this game deserves all the praise I can give it.\n\nYou start off by selecting whether to play as the male human Saren or the female elf Elenor. Either way, the gist of the how the game starts remains the same. You are a slave to the Amazons, and have been for a long time. Saren was born into servitude among the Amazons, while Elenor traded her freedom for protection when she was a child.\n\nThe Queen has gone missing and against tradition, the Princess, Loren, goes off to find her. By the laws of the Amazons, she is forfeiting the resources of her title by leaving to look for her. The Amazons do, however, provide her with a servant to assist her, one who has shown great promise and loyalty: you.\n\nThe story begins as a search for a missing Queen, but Loren, her servant and the others they run into along the way quickly become embroiled into a much greater matter; that may decide the fate of not only the Amazons but all of Aravorn.\n\nTo get right down to what's great about this game: the characters are amazing. This is one of those games where you will remember the characters long after you've hit the end credits. Whether you choose to play as Saren or Elenor will determine which characters you can pursue a romantic relationship with; if you wish to purse any of them at all.\n\nIf old fashioned man-on-girl action isn't your thing (and don't worry, it has that too), then prepare to fall head over heals with Winter Wolves for selection they've given you here. Saren and Elenor may both pursue a romance with Princess Loren, for instance, however only Saren can woo the elven druid, Myrth. Only Elenor, on the other hand, can win the heart of the assassin, Rei. The Amazon Queen, Karen, however, isn't really going to be won over by Saren; but Elenor might just be able to win the heart of the beautiful Queen. She'll have noticeably less luck with the ever-adorable fire-mage, Draco, who may find his attention better drawn to Saren's manly charms.\n\nThere are other romance options available, as well, but I won't spoil everything here. And there's certainly more to be interested in than just who you can romance. The characters are all very memorable, even if you don't pursue them. They'll also prove to be quite useful when combat occurs.\n\nAt the start of the game, you decide not only which one of the two protagonists to play, but what class they are; either warrior or thief. This determines the sort of abilities you'll have in combat. Every character has a sub-class as well, and in the protagonist's case, it's "Hero", which gives you access to healing and support skills, regardless of your main class chosen.\n\nWhichever class you pick, you'll find different characters will compliment you in different ways on the battlefield. Some serve better in the front lines, soaking up most of the damage, while others are better positioned in the back where they can blast away at the enemy with arrows or magic; or perhaps heal up your party so they can keep on fighting.\n\nThe combat system itself, while graphically very simple, is actually quite enjoyable and tactical. The placement of your party, as well as how you level them, and what you equip them with goes a long way towards victory or defeat; though rest assured that its pretty hard to mis-manage yourself into a corner, especially since you can go into the options and lower the difficulty at any time if you find a battle is proving too much for you.\n\nThat may sound like it makes the game too easy, but it really doesn't. If you want the challenge, simply restrict yourself from using that option. At the end of the day, however, this game isn't exactly about gameplay. The fact that the gameplay is actually really enjoyable is just icing on the cake. The heart of this game is the characters, the writing and the story. What you have here is a richly crafted world, with three-dimensional (in personality, not graphical design) characters, and a story that, while perhaps not revolutionizing how we look at medieval fantasy, is clever, well conceived, well-written and well-delivered. To top it all off, while you certainly won't be making quite as many major plot choices as you would in Dragon Age or Mass Effect, you do have a very distinct sense that your character made a difference by the end of this game, and the coices you did make mattered.\n\nThis game has quite a fair amount of replay value. You can see what its like picking the other protagonist, which changes some scenes and dialogue here and there; and unlocks different romance options. You can see what different romance paths are like, and how they'll effect things. You can also simply try out different character builds and try to get better at the combat system. There's also a few plot decisions you might want to try differently, to see how they play out.\n\nTo sum it up, if you like RPGs, with a bit more of an emphasis on the "RP" than the "G", this is a game for you. The gameplay is solid, but I think most people who fall in love with this game like I have will do so more because of the roleplaying than the gameplay mechanics. If you like romance, this is a game for you. If you've been yearning for more games that recognize that gay, lesbian and bisexual people DO exist, than this is a game you will want to check out. I still feel like I haven't properly conveyed how much I love this game. It may not be for everyone, but if you're even considering getting it, I recomend at LEAST grabbing the demo off of the developer's website and giving it a try.\n\nEDIT: I just thought I'd add, I recommend getting the DLC if you play. Its pretty cheap, and the new content is totally worth it.","January 15, 2014","true","0.2"," 131 of 230 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","131","230","0","7"

This game happens to feature a hybrid visual novel RPG component that lends itself to degrees of challenge. However, don't expect something complicated or in depth for that matter. I found the battles to be slightly tedious at one point because I was more into the story.\n\nThe game starts off as a rag tag duo of you a lowly servant and your Amazon Princess off to find out the whereabouts of her mother. The game then blossoms into your typical team of unlikely heroes out to save the world from impending evil. We've seen this plot before and it isn't unique in any sense. What I enjoyed was the individual character stories and relationship building. You don't necessarily date anyone in the game but as you spend time getting to know your fellow travelers you get the option to romance a few of them and grow closer as the story progresses.\n\nI've played through this game as both the male and female choices. There are several characters for each to get closer to and all of them eventually have individual quests that you can partake in. So while the story is linear in nature you have plenty of side quests and branching that allows you to deviate a bit in the path you take throughout the game.\n\nOne thing I appreciate about this game is it gives equal opportunity fanservice. Sure characters are pretty scantily dressed and there's no shortage of semi nakedness going on you are just as apt to see topless guys as you would see nearly nude females. Also there's opportunity for gay and lesbian romance options. Options, being the key word, if you don't like seeing a budding romance between 2 men you can totally avoid it. Now the Steam version is the slightly censored version of the game in which the characters might wear a little more clothes and show a little less skin. To remove the censor there are a few guides you can reference, it's quite simple. Note that the intimate scenes are tastefully done and everyone wears underwear but aren't scenes that are of the SFW variety. But really, if you're playing this game at work it'll make little difference if your boss sees elf boobs or not.\n\nThe writing was well done. I actually enjoyed all the characters stories and dialogue and it was a great reprieve in between all the mundane fighting. After you finish the game once you can unlock the cheat menu to auto-win the fights so you can play this game as a pure VN experience.  With the expansion unlocks an few additional side quests, characters and events adding an extra few hours to your journey. But you might want to play the base game first. Overall I enjoyed this game and think anyone who wants a little more variety in their visual novel would enjoy this.","January 20, 2015","true","73.8"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

Buy it when it goes to 40% off or better.\n\nGood points:\n\n- The combat system is pretty good for its type, and I enjoyed trying to figure out the best abilities, combos, and strategies.  Don't believe the bit that says to choose Moderate Difficulty if you have RPG experience--crank it to Hard.  A good number of the battles seem to be scaled to average party level, so you don't have to worry about swapping in someone underpowered.\n\n- A bunch of the character dialogue is really amusing, mostly anything involving Draco or Dora.  Other dialogue was occasionally cheesy but usually good.  I wasn't bothered by the Joking-Friendly-Forceful choices not telling you what was actually going to be said, partly because they almost never affect the end result of a conversation and partly because I eventually figured out that you could use the mouse wheel to scroll back and pick a different option as many times as you like.\n\n- You can save/load pretty much anywhere and there are a giant number of savegame slots.  Alas that you cannot tag descriptions onto them.\n\nBad points:\n\n- The documentation/help is limited and in at least one instance (the combat help) is outright wrong.  Example that irritated me right off: if you play a Thief you're asked to choose among skills that inflict status ailments without any way to determine what the ailments actually do.\n\n- It needs another pass or three of heavy editing.  The writing has a lot of grammar and phrasing and usage errors, and the storyline sometimes suffers from plot inconsistency and obvious logic issues.  In a story-driven game that relies so heavily on text, these were really annoying.   (It also has a lot of ridiculously unlikely things happen just because they're plot-convenient, but that's kind of par for the course in this genre.)\n\n- Better branch tracking would be good too--there are two main ways to get through chapter one, but there are parts of chapter two that assume you went one way and were seriously confusing to me because I went the other.\n\n- I am not sure why the game has gear with mage-only stats that mages can't wear.  Maybe to drain gold from the unwary?\n\n- When you finally get to see a second drawing of a character in Ch 4, it's only 50/50 whether they look the same as the first drawing.  (As a related good-ish point, it's kind of amazing what they can do with only one drawing and some variant facial expressions.)\n\n\nI could talk about the outfits, but...

After I finished Plant Stronghold by the same developer, I liked that game a lot and so was looking forward to Loren and sure enough, it didn't disappoint me.  Out of all the games in my Steam library, this one has been played the most.  For those wondering why I put in so many hours, I wanted to play all the romance paths without taking any shortcuts.  Otherwise, my play time would have been much shorter.  Also, I wanted to get as much of the experience trying out the different fighter classes, customizing characters, etc.\n\nUpon first glance, this game sort of made me think of the Lord of the Rings series because it is classified as an epic fantasy and I tend to think of LoTR as the same.  However, there are noteable differences and additions in Loren that make it nothing like LoTR.\n\nI like how you can start customizing your playable character, choosing to play as either a male or female and determining the fighter classes and stats.  As you progress in the game, you can recruit up to 11 characters to join you on your journey.  (This is assuming that you purchase the DLC in addition to the base game.  I would recommend buying the DLC, btw, as it gives an additional side story and thus allows for longer gameplay.)  The quests you complete will give you experience points (standard for any RPG) which allows you to level up your characters accordingly.  You can either go through one playthrough using the same characters or switch them up.  I found that I used basically the same characters for most of the quests although for certain ones, I had no choice but to switch them up.\n\nSince other reviews have summarized what Loren is about, I won't repeat that.  Instead, I'd like to say how much I enjoyed this game.  However, it did have some weaknesses.  At times, I noticed that there were typos and repetition of words which should have been corrected by a proofreader.  Although there weren't a lot, there were some and it would be beneficial to the developer if they were corrected in a future update to make reading the story easier.\n\nAlso, I have to admit that there were times I thought the character development could have been improved.  For instance, at the beginning of the game, Loren comes off as stubborn and seemingly all knowing (even though she clearly is not).  I had hoped that Loren would have become less stubborn as the game progressed and although there were times that she did, there were instances late in the game where she would suddenly become stubborn again and that annoyed me.  Of course, this could be more of a preference on my part.  I prefer characters that grow for the better rather than continue to have a static personality.  There were other characters who had the problem of having a static personality as well but as Loren is one of the main characters, I had hoped that she would have developed and matured more as a person.  Although the game says that she does, I couldn't see it so well for myself (or there weren't enough instances to show me otherwise).  Having heard that there is going to be a sequel for this game, I hope we'll get to see a more mature, wiser Loren.\n\nFinally, again, this is more of a personal preference than anything but I wish the art style had been somewhat different in regards to the characters.  I wasn't a fan of how the majority of the women were portrayed since I would have liked to have seen different body styles to show more realistic versions of women.\n\nDespite my criticisms, though, I did enjoy Loren very much and had lots of fun with the battles as well as interacting with most of the characters.  I can tell that a lot of time and effort went into this game and it paid off.  I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes RPGs and also likes visual novels, as there are some of those aspects here as well, such as romancing certain characters.  (Of course, it's not necessary to pursue a romance at all but it makes the game all the more enjoyable if you do so.)","August 29, 2015","true","170.1"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","17","24","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/orpe11/recommended/257970/","orpe11","orpe11","http://steamcommunity.com/id/orpe11/","474 products in account","TL;DR: An even mixture of RPG and Visual novel. Well done story and gameplay, nothing extraordinary, but worth a play.\n\nLoren: The Amazon Princess is one of those rare birds of a Visual Novel that is equal parts RPG gameplay and story sections. Both are executed well, and complement each other very well. If I was to sum up the game it one word, it would in fact be competence. While that shouldn't be rare, the fact that this game executes everything well, with very few stumbling blocks, is worthwhile enough for me to give it my reccomendation. I did truly enjoy the game in my first play through, and the only frustrations I found were in acheivement-hunting for 100% completion, given it requires quite a few playthroughs in order to get all the romance acheivements.\n\nThe story is nothing outstanding. Your main character is a slave to the titular Loren, and the game plays out as you being the deutaragonist to her. You can pick your gender, which will affect romance options, though the game treats bisexuality as the norm, as most characters have romance options with both. When I say it is not outstanding, that doesn't mean it is bad. It is a good story, and I enjoyed it at first, but it doesn't push any boundaries, and stays fairly in line with common tropes of the fantasy RPG genre. If anything, the game could be closest compared story wise to Dragon Age: Origins. Big bad threat, have to convince various factions to follow you, recruit a diverse cast, talk to them over the campfire to get their stories and personal quests. If the game has any faults story wise it is that you really don't have much control over the story itself. Dialogue options tend to be selecting tone of your character (or increasing romance points), and you get very few major choices throughout the story. Your ending is basically determined by who you romanced, a final option at the end, and whether or not you did the DLC content.\n\nGameplay wise, combat plays out in a turn based style, with your characters arrayed on a 2x3 grid opposite your opponents similarly laid out grid. Turns are according to a characters speed and the 'delay' of their last attack. A lot of the combat is based on status effects. The entire rogue skill tree, and most fighter skills rely on the opponent either being staggered (which can occur through powerful hits), or having various other status effects applied through spells or other skills. The game seems to be intended that you would apply status effects with mages, and have the rogues/fighters take advantage of them to deal tremendous damage. In practice though, since most fights including bosses are against masses of enemies, I found it better to stack three mages with max level AoE spells, and blast them down, leaving fighters/rogue for cleanup. The game has a fairly simple level up system, where your characters get stat points every level, and a skill point every few levels. The skill points let you progress down (short) talent trees, usually getting rank 1, then 2, then 3 of an ability. For most, this is just more damage, though mages progress from single target, to row, to all. There is practically no reason to spread things out, and far better to get rank 3 in a few abilities to deal massive damage, and spread out later to other damage types. Each character has a primary and secondary skill tree. The primary tree is of the fighter/rogue/mage basic class, and the secondary is unique to that character. This allows every character in the varied class to have a unique feel, a definite bonus.\n\nThe game is intended to be played multiple times, hence the sheer amount of romance acheivements being practically more than the rest all combined. After you finish the game, the game does let you put it on story mode, which essentially disables combat, and lets you quickly skip through the game to the various endings.\n\nThe only major downside I found in this game was inventory management, and the lack of leaked experience. In essence,  if you want your characters to have great gear, you will need to buy it. The costs for said gear are extremely high. You can lower the costs by doing repeated fights in towns, but it only works for that town. This also serves to give you money and vendor trash, but in small amounts. Story fights give you only the occasional decent piece of gear, and character side quests will usually give you a major item, but I went through the game with most of my party missing a huge chunk of gear slots, and even my main characters were often missing rings and belts. In addition, experience is not leaked to non-party members, which means that in several sections of the game where you are forced to use certain characters (their sidequests, sections where you have to fight through hordes and have characters get worn down), if you have been focusing on a single party you will be punished severely. The only way to catch these characters up is the aforementioned grinding fights, which barely give decent experience.\n\nOverall, Loren is a well done game. It will never sit on my 'Oh my god, you must play this!' list, but it is well executed, competent, and deserving of play if you enjoy these types of games.","April 29","true","59.4"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Combat is a little bit like Eye of the Beholder, but unfortunately doesn't have it's sense of exploration.\n\nBeing a game about narrative and character interaction, a big problem is when the game gives you options on how to respond, it's very vague about what that response actually is: for example, if someone calls your friend an a-hole, you might get three choices: joking, friendly, or forceful. So you pick forceful, thinking you're going to put that jerk in their place, only to realize afterwards that "forceful" meant "forcefully agree", and your character says something like "YES HE SURE IS A SERIOUS A-HOLE."\n\nAlso, during the first part of the game, the vast majority of the loot you find or have the option to purchase will be considerably worse than the gear you start with, which will leave you a little bored with some of the RPG elements, at least early on.\n\nCould recommend if you're a fan of visual novel-type games and it's on sale.","June 22, 2014","true","0.9"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

Obviously one can easily take a negative view of this approach, as some opinions on the forum point out that the gameplay pales to other classics ranging from Wizardry 8 to Final Fantasy Tactics, and at the same time, more opinions claim that the visual novel aspect simply doesn't match the same kind of brilliant depth as Baldur's Gate II or even the granddaddy of them all - Planescape: Torment.\n\nHowever, I think for anyone who might be curious about this game, I would like to point out the earnest effort in making and polishing this product.  This isn't something rushed out of the door (coughE*cough) just to catch a sale season, or some "early access" taking donations with promises.  The game plus the DLC have been available outside of Steam for quite some time now, and it has been continuously tweaked in various aspects - story, writing, gameplay, graphics, etc.  It's a well-oiled piece, ready to be enjoyed, and it's definitely not a half baked beta test that expects regular patches and headaches.\n\nSpeaking of the gameplay, sure the RPG element isn't as robust as, say, FFT or the Disgaea series, but it's got the standard character attributes, skill trees, affinities/weaknesses, skill combos, and not to mention, more characters than you could field in a single playthrough for some replayability.  Nothing extraordinary, but solid enough to service the game well.\n\nThe visual novel part of the game is evidently made with much dedication and care.  The typical "ancient evil and the heroine who saves the world" plot line notwithstanding, I could appreciate when a writer tries to develop each character as much as possible - interactions, background story, and personalities.  Each character also has a personal quest to build more depth (and loot!).  Similar to reading a book, I think it's up to each player to use some of his/her imagination to meld the words and the art together for the game world to take substance, so to speak.\n\nI'm not some kind of educated art critic, so I'll just say that WYSIWYG, the characters, backgrounds, etc, if I recall, were all hand drawn, so it does have a certain style to it.  At least there was no 50 caves that all look the same as infamously seen in some -other- "AAA" RPGs.\n\nWord of advice - if you want some kind of game with heat of battle and adrenaline rush from defeating a boss or encounter, this probably isn't it.  If you, for some reason, are looking for straight up visual novels, well, Steam isn't the best source for that at this time.\n\nBut for a relaxing game with some art, some story, and some RPG gameplay?  This game with the DLC should easily last you 10+ hours in one playthrough, longer if you stop and smell/read the roses, and maybe another run for a bit of replayability.","January 17, 2014","true","20.5"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","14","21","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SilvaOfWind/recommended/257970/","SilvaOfWind","Silva","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SilvaOfWind/","338 products in account","For the purposes of this review, I will start with this: As an occasional but relatively infrequent insomniac, I played this game from start to finish over the course of the night and through the morning not because I had nothing better to do but because I had to know how things would end. There is no higher honor for written fiction than that feeling of "just one more page", much like the videogame equivalent "just one more level". I say written fiction because while you can argue back and forth about whether visual novels are games (in my view they are), the highlight of Loren The Amazon Princess is still narrative over gameplay.\n\nBut unlike many if not most visual novels, there is an actual game here in a game mechanics sense. Fittingly for such a high-fantasy oriented story, it plays as a hybrid between entirely literary visual novels and an RPG. Do not expect the depth of a dedicated RPG. That is not to be found here.\n\nDespite that there is still a commendable level of depth considering it's status as a hybrid. Equipment, level ups, stat points, skill trees and varied character classes are accounted for. Technically the only class choice you have the power to alter is the chosen player surrogate (there are two available) at the very start of the game, but the various party members have distinct roles and flexibility within those roles even if say, the dwarf chick will always be a bow-oriented type. Character forcing does occur at times for narrative reasons, but the game ensures that even characters you don't use often will be of relatively close level to your mainstays. The player surrogate and the titular Loren are often but not exclusively required members, but that's not a huge deal out of a party of six at a time when the roster fills out.\n\n\nOn the narrative front, people often compare this to Dragon Age Origins. That isn't entirely accurate. The theme of uniting different peoples to face an overarching threat is present in both games, and there is a character much like Morrigan. Other than that, it's mostly that both are archetypal fantasy stories.\n\n\nMake no mistake, Loren is not a narrative you seek out for surprises. Anyone with decent familarity with fantasy novels will find little to shock them. A poor writer would let that result in a boring story, but thankfully the developers are not poor writers. What the writing lacks in surprises it more than makes up for in quality. A well rounded cast with believable motivations, genuine character development, and some damn quotable lines make this a visual novel you don't want to miss.\n\n\nAlso: if any of that RPG side of things doesn't sound like your deal, don't worry about it. The difficulty options and competent automated options for distributing stats and skill points means you will have to micromanage only exactly as much as you want to and not a bit more. Equipment lacks that, of course, but that's straight forward anyway.\n\n\nTL:DR; BUY IT ALREADY.","November 2, 2014","true","14.1"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Detailed and generally fit the personalities of the characters.\n\nMusic is really impressive - esp. for a indie title - props to the team on that front.\n\nGameplay is a subjective matter - I grew up with old school games, so I was fine with it being portraits and skills; but what did bother me was poor/limited item selection; I didnt feel there was enough variety for gearing up - as an example, I spent the whole game with me theif using the default chest armor becuase nothing else was worthwhile for speed - despite searching shops hundreds of timesonly to see the same cycled selection of choices (randomly).\n\nI liked most of the characters personalities; or the thought put into them - though "my" character was a annoying waste of space - you give me dialouge choices - then proceed to shove values/feelings done my MC's throat - regardless of my choices; made the MC feel very spastic and hollow.\n\nwhich leads me to my main gripe - this COULD have been a epic story; but I felt the writer was too excited or in a rush to finish; the narrative is grotesquely melodramatic and unpolished. If he or she took their time to tell the story properly or with more depth - and with less melodrama - this had a real possiblity to be high up in my ranks.\n\nThat, and foreshadowing - the writer seemed to feel the need to tell the reader what was going to happen multiple times, prior to the events (at least four times, to my count).

I finished it with the same feeling I get after reading a great book; sadness, that it was over. I very much look forward to more from Winter Wolves in this vein.\n\nThe story is a little cliched, and seemed to be a Lord of the Rings parody of sorts. You have an aged wizard guiding everyone to resist against the upcoming of a dark lord, a deathknight of animated armor that happened to have more than a passing resemblence to the ringwraiths. The hero had to unite many broken kingdoms that needed to come together to defeat said knight (although that's a common trope to this fantasy setting anyway). There are the amazons, though, with a few undead here and there, so it's not all bad. The bright part of the story is that the protanist was not in a special position before the story began, and was instead a slave.\n\nAny unoriginality in the story, however, is completely forgivable considering the dialogue. For a text-heavy game (the sound effects were just there to replace silence), the text was easy to read, and the game does it brilliantly; I was captivated from the start, and every character had a distinct personality that remained consistent throughout the entire game. Through their personal stories, you can come to relate to every one of your party members, and most of them are done well.\n\nThe romances were well done, with each of the two selectable protagonists (male human or female elf slaves/servants) having a variety of suiters to pursue. The romances only lightly effected the plot, however, and the effects of these personal relationships were only felt during minor plot points. The game could be played without romances at all, which may be odd considering it markets itself as a romantic novel.\n\nLoren The Amazon Princess shines in its dialogue and characters, but is not without its flaws. The typical "Joke, Friendly, Forceful" dialogue options were a jarring experience. They didn't give you any indication at all as to what you'd actually say, which introduced something completely unpredicatable in a genre where the one thing that should be relatively predictable is the progranonist. It was easy to work around (scroll up to go back, or save/reload), but doing it this way was a strange decision from the designers.\n\nThe combat was extremely easy on normal, but that may have been because the focus was on the story. The turn based system with combos was interesting enough to survive the whole game without getting too boring.\n\nThe graphics were well framed with the plot, but the backgrounds were heavily reused, and the game could definately have benefited from having more of them. It was easy to forget where we were based on any particular background image.\n\nAll in all, I thoroughly enjoyed and recommend this game to lovers of visual novels. There are plenty of 'they lived happily ever after' endings, as well as one or two not so happy, and if you allow yourself to fall into the characters, a definite sadness when the tale ends and there's nothing more to read.","November 3, 2014","true","28.3"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

The best thing about it is it has the best parts of an RPG- namely a good story, interesting, well-written characters, and a decent combat mechanic system.  What Winterwolves does particularly well is that this style of gaming with the Ren‚ÄôPy engine does away with the ‚Äòfluff‚Äô or sometimes superfluous content developers put in to artificially extend the playtime.  Forget wandering around town talking to every NPC or pixel hunting to find quest items, you can fast travel town to town and quests are plot driven.  You can even fast forward bits of story you‚Äôve seen if you don‚Äôt want to waste time.  Every minute you play you are doing what you want to do rather than what the game forces you to waste time doing.  You will end up spending the majority of the time unfolding the story, battling and interacting with your characters.\n\nDialogue choices are somewhat fixed and not customising in that aspect (think Dragon age 2) but it was a sufficient mechanic to drive the story forward.  You will end up making gameplay decisions throughout the game that does impact the world state.  The story may share some similarities and tones to Dragon Age: Origins but still a pleasure to watch unfold.  Combat is very similar to Monster‚Äôs Den flash game series and does have an engaging tactical element.  There are 3 main classes (warrior, rogue, mage) with each character having one class skill tree and one unique character skill tree.  Light grinding is all you need to get through the story and difficulty options allow you to focus more on story aspects.  For those who like to grind and get the best gear the option is there but it‚Äôs not necessary.  You will end up recruiting and adventuring with a party of 10 characters (DLC introduces 2 more) so there are many combos and customisations you can play with.\n\nThe character sprites and visuals are beautiful to look at and despite the simplicity actually works well in creating a convincing setting for the story and there is optional fan service mode.  Sure, there can be a few more backgrounds but this game is a great example of creativity when less is more.  The romance CGs and interactions are fun and rewarding to unlock.  There are multiple racial/gender romance options for each character and I applaud the writer for putting all those in, and for the meaningful character progression gained through these interactions.  Each party NPC will also have a rewarding personal quest.\n\nTo accompany the visuals I must mention the lush score that accompanies the game.  The soundtrack is excellent and I never tire of hearing the themes.  The dramatic and emotional moments are particularly heightened with good use of tracks.\n\nMy minor critiques are with the player dialogue choices- I‚Äôd rather see the 3 options than joking/friendly/optional and they don‚Äôt really feel very different.  The romances and triangles are handled well but I‚Äôd like a tiny bit more climax and epilogue detail.  Would have liked to see a few more side quests and story elements from the towns and map locations based on renown.  Combat wise it‚Äôs a great system but the class skill trees pales in comparison with unique skill trees and perhaps the different weapon types could add different effects (eg difference between single/dual/2H weapon) in terms of range, AoE and damage.\n\nOverall well worth the experience.

I liked it. Not every gamer is a twitch player, so this was a non-frustrating game to play.\n\nI liked that the player had a ton of different romanceable companions, and endings, depending on the pc's gender and personality style.  (Hence the many play throughs to see all the different endings.)  Some of the relationships, however, felt creepy/abusive - the kind where you'd tell a girlfriend to WALK AWAY THIS GUY IS BAD NEWS sort of thing.\n\nAbout a quarter of the writing fell into the "purple prose" category.  I could have done without all the internal musings by my character; it felt that the amazing dialogue between certain characters and reparte was written by one author and the internal musings was written by the author's angsty emo younger sibling.\n\nThat being said, I really enjoyed the game and the dlcs. Played "Loren" for at least 39 hours, so I got my money's worth.  Hoping the developer's next game - Season of the Wolf (?) when it comes out is equally good.

A mass effect or dragon age 2 (not the brilliant Origins) dialogue clone, with "joking", "friendly" and "forceful" given as dialogue options. A simplistic interactive "click-through-images" story really, not real role-play, as the character can never become the player's own choice. Dialogue options are rather left obscurely behind the "archetype" veil. Of which there are three. With no grey tones or shades inbetween.\n\nThe game's everything that's wrong with the "modern" "dumbed-down" xbox-direction Bioware is taking, only with a nonexistant budget and no flash. The anime aesthetic can be of interest though, and a perspective of dating sim aspects is solid yet niche as ever. It's quite a wide niche though and appealing for the love-affairs-building sentiments of many.\n\nIn gameplay, Loren is most akin to visual novels with barebones battle mechanics. Interfaces are quite ugly, thoughts going into choices (hence, choices) are minimal and there's no real joy in playing.\n\nMusic is bland, art is western wannabe-anime type, and backgrounds get rehashed a lot.\n\nYet there is some merit to how the story and characters unfold.

The game played more like a Visual Novel to me, but the game had an RPG-esque system, so it's not totally a VN.\n\nLoren the Amazon Princess follows the tale of Loren, an Amazon Princess (who would've guessed?) searching for her missing mother. The game plays heavily on the story aspect, and that's not a bad thing. I certainly enjoyed the story thus far. If you're expecting a lot of gameplay, you might want to look elsewhere. The game has a skills, inventory management, and even battles, but about 80% of your time will be spent reading the dialogue. The game even delves into romance later on, if that's your kind of thing (heh, heh).\n\nThe combat in the game is all turn-based and is a bit unique, certainly unlike any other turn-based mechanic I've seen. The combat is split into "rows", with your primary fighter up front (up to three), and your others behind them (also up to three). This also applies to the enemies, of which there are plenty. You can max out your party at six players, which I've yet to do, but would love to just to try it out in battle. There's also skill and inventory management, something which should be expected from any adventure-based RPG. Nothing too special with these systems, but at least they're there.\n\nI'd recommend Loren the Amazon Princess for anyone looking for a heavily story-driven RPG or maybe those looking for a VN with some RPG-esque elements.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzuqJlls1Ao","January 23, 2014","true","1.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The developers of the hit title Planet Stronghold have dedicated themselves to keeping old-school RPGs alive through this new adventure.' when i read that after playing i just had to laugh since the combat was as simplistic, 'grind-like-hell'ish, 'just-smack-you-on-da-face'-style, no strategies required. There's fundamentaly no depth in it, just choose the attack with most damage and start killing the baddies.\n\nAgain this is not a bad game per se but its not worth its money as is, haven't the DLC hence I don't know if this changes some of this.\n\nEDIT: Forgot to add that the dialogue choices are annoying at best since there are only three... in every dialogue... remember those old games where your character seemingly hadn't enough brain to say anything other than variations of 'yes' or 'no' with no room for something like 'well cool but could we instead do [OPTION 3]' or something like that? Now you've got 'Joking' 'Friendly' and 'Forceful' which are sometimes totally unintuitive. Imagine: You see your master arguing with someone, then both for some reason turn to the slave to ask for his/her opinion, since the argument started to get very heated you should think that 'Joking' brings your character to do something funny to loose up the situation... well no it could be that you just joke ABOUT either of the persons involved in the argument (read: A your master... probably not a good idea, or B: For example a major of some town... also not a good idea to provoke him... as a slave), I'm not saying that this happens everytime you cllick on joking its just that sometimes the result is just so far away from what you'd expect from that option.\nOfcourse you can just use your mousewheel to scroll back in the conversation but still this seems so annoying.\n\n\nLastly the 'romance scenes' for that you should read abundantgrace's or Striker Eureka's reviews as I think they describe them pretty good.\n\nTL:DR:\nIs it a good game? Hardly albeit quite enjoyable at moments\nIs it a decent game then? Pretty much so, expect nothing to write home about but still you should be able to enjoy it somewhat\nIs it worth the money? Thats a though question depending if its your cup of tea, if you are curious about buying iti wait for a sale and grab it there.","April 28, 2014","false","11.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

However, if I had it to do over, I would have waited until the game was under $10 before I bought it.  Nothing about this game justifies it's price tag, the gameplay elements for each class consist of about 8 powers that you can put skills into that basically just make most of those eight powers better.  And even the eight powers, in some cases, are just variations of each other.  For example, the rogue has four powers that all basically do the exact same thing but just apply slightly different damage types.\n\nAs far as dialogue options go, you basically have 3 (sometimes 4) dialogue options for each situation,  Joking, Friendly, and Forceful (and sometimes Romance).  I'm not sure if the dialogue choices make a big difference as this is my first playthrough and am mostly choosing the friendly options.  However, it is a bit annoying that the actual things you'll say aren't shown before you say them.  The game suffers from Mass Effect syndrome where you might choose a dialogue option and the actual option isn't even close to what you wanted to say.  The good news is, you can use the mouse scroll wheel to backtrack and choose different options, but this can get annoying if you find yourself backtracking every other choice.  If the game gave more indication of what impact dialogue options had on the story, I would prolly enjoy this gameplay aspect more.\n\nIf there was more to the gameplay, I might be willing to recommend it.  But story alone is not enough to justify the amount of money the devs are asking.  If you don't really care about gameplay and just want a nice, relaxing (and somewhat simple) game you can sit back and enjoy and don't mind spending the $20, then this is the game for you.  However, if you're like me and like a good mix of gameplay and story, I'd wait until the price goes down a bit.","January 22, 2014","false","11.1"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

You don't play dressup as a Princess.  You don't marry Princes.  You don't kiss frogs.  Before judging, just read the review and give the game a shot.  Also, don't take my short playtime into account, as Steam was bugged for this for some reason.  I have over 15 hours logged into this game.\n\nLoren the Amazon Princess is a roleplaying game with a strong emphasis on storyline, almost in the form of a "choose your own adventure" novel.  It is backwards narrated in a very unique way, going back and "remembering" this epic story of Loren (the main character), and her companion--the character that YOU play.  In case you're confused, you actually play as the main character's companion, not the main character herself.  A very odd concept, but very refreshing.\n\nThroughout the game, you travel in search of your lost mother, the Queen of the Amazons, and the story unveils itself through the journey.  As you are leaving your Citadel for the first time in your life, you find foreigners (elves, dwarves, humans, etc) and other strange folk along the way, often wanting to join your party or asking for help, or interacting with you in some way or another.\n\nLike all roleplaying games, you will gather quests through storylines, complete quests and kill monsters for experience, and level up your party how you see fit.  And your party, while mentioned, consists of members that are multi-classed.  For example, as you create your playable character, he or she can become a Warrior/Hero, or perhaps a Thief/Hero.  On your journey, you may find a Mage/Elementalist, or perhaps a Warrior/Berserker.  This gives you the customization to build your party how you wish, giving a strong complement to your team.  As you level up, you add attribute points into Strength, Skill, and Willpower, and choose feats every two levels.\n\nI will be honest--this game took me by surprise.  It is a fantastic game that sucker punched me right in the mouth, and you will soon find yourself pretty deep into the storyline.  The combat is just unique enough to keep a veteran roleplaying gamer satisfied, as you fight by rows and columns.  Furthermore, the ability to set up camp and talk to members of your party gives the player a very relaxed feel as he or she gets to know more about who they are grouping with.\n\nI most certainly recommend this game, and its DLC, as it has a great storyline, simple, yet fun combat, decent character customization, a fantastic soundtrack, and sets you on a very fun epic journey.  It is for sure a great addition to any gamer's library, and will surely quench the satisfaction from any RPG'er.\n\nI rate this game an 8.1 / 10","November 10, 2014","true","19.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I believe that making the general dialogue options nonspecific is bad; they seem to be trying for an Alpha Protocol thought process with the choices, but succeed mostly in making it annoying to pick what you actually want to say. Romances feel somewhat shallow, and have clearly marked options for getting them; there's no gameplay influence if you do or don't pursue people's affections. Party quests are just a free item for a character.\n\nCombat is mostly in the realm of "serviceable"; there's no pyrotechnics or fancy graphics, and I feel like the growth is too slow at times. At endgame, I wound up with most characters being early 20s, and I just felt like, in general, I was blowing points on just maintaining diversity, not actually improving my characters. There's too much of a "Right Way To Build", in my opinion, and character options are disappointingly limited; your protagonist will -always- be the party healer (and if you don't build them for that, unfortunately, you're crippling yourself), regardless of if they're a Thief or Warrior.\n\nDespite all this..

The big trick is making sure you take advantage of the Pokemon like element type system since some foes are weaker to say Dark damage then they are to Normal, Wind, Water, Fire or Earth (meaning you might want to stalk up on even slightly weaker weapons if they have a different damage type then that more powerful sword you got off a boss, just s you are not dealing 30 point of damage when you could be dealing 100 points just for doing a mid battle swap out)\n\nI noticed Loren The Amazon Princess has some similar trait to Dragon Age when it comes to uniting the races of the world against the main villain (mainly in getting them to stop trying to kill each other and not making the live of the bad guys that much easier) but unlike DA, you do not need 2 hours wandering through caves, forest or ruins to find your target, the game stream lines this by being much like a book that takes you right to the heart of mission, fight the target an move onto the next plot point.\n\nSince the game is so streamlined, you do not need to grind for levels though it is still an option by doing Tasks that are in most village (which also build up local fame and provide discounts at the local store) the big thing about grinding in Loren is...its not easy as the game was clearly built for you not needing to be level 50 to win. I myself only had mot of my guys at 18 to 21 by the time I faced the final boss.\n\nNow as for the main character, you get two options for him/her: Human Male and Elf Female and both of those have the option of Warrior or Rouge as a base class plus your pre-chosen second class of Hero. At first this might be a let down to those who like Mage style builds (or arcane knight style player like myself) but this is probably for the reason of if the MC could sling a fireball as well as cast the support spells the Hero Class gives him or her well... can see a pure mage just being over powered if that were possible so this was probably good move from the game's creators to take away the mage route for the MC in this case.\n\nNow as for romance (as we all know is common thing in all RPGs to provide non critical but interesting side plots for the game) your chosen starting gender let to romance some characters but not all, though most swing both ways so you have a classic Bioware style romance system in this game. Loran for example can be romanced by both MC genders but Draco can only be romanced by the male MC.\n\nOverall Loren The Amazon Princess is a fun (though short) game I recommend for those enjoy a good turn based RPG.","January 18, 2014","true","157.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Your face will hit your palm early on and it will not leave it until the end of the adventure.\n\nThe combat mechanics also seemed to be heavily skewed in favour of magic. Perhaps I'm just bad at the game, but every battle seemed to devolve into letting the warriors soak up the beats whilst Draco brought down the pain. Perhaps that's what people expect in an MMO age, but I felt it lessened the depth of the game. Well over half the skills ended up being completely useless. Upgrade power strike, and your warrior can deal 20% more damage!

It's cliche, but these days, many high fantasy adventure games follow the same tropes. Though cliche, there was a certain charm about the story that led me to continue to play the game. Combat is decent, though monotonous after a while. I found myself powering through battles just to get to cutscenes and camp, just so I could interact with the characters some more. The characters, while nothing terribly original, were fun, likeable, and reason enough to keep me coming back to play some more. Pleasantly enough, the interactions seem to change slightly depending on your character's gender, which makes for a refreshing second or third playthrough. As I mentioned before, Loren isn't unlike Dragon Age as far as party relations go. You're free to romance your party members if you so choose (some are only open to MCs of certain genders), or you can just remain platonic with them. Either way, I enjoyed that this game features a way to get to know the party other than snippets of dialogue from cutscenes.\n\nLoren the Amazon Princess is a game definitely worth picking up if you enjoy otomes and/or action adventure games with rich party interactions.","April 14","true","13.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Even though the events are mainly text-based and combat is a simple as it gets, Loren managed to provide the user with hours upon hours of fun.\n\nMainly it does this through a combination of excellent characters with deep tactical combat.  The amount of sub-classes and skills sets are quite impressive.  Even though heavy grinding isn't a requirement, I found myself doing a lot of it just because I wanted to unlock higher level skills.  It also optimizes the team concept by forcing the player to utalize the best combination of characters on the battlefield that mutually support each other.  For example, the theif class has limited effectiveness against healthy enemies.  But inflict a negative status (like poison or confusion) on an enemy and suddenly your theif will a turn into top-quality killing machine against them.  As such, it's important to team them up with characters who specialize in status abnormality inflicting attacks.  Likewise, there are all sorts of ways to tip the odds in your favor, such as using your front line brutes to absorb damage aimed at your weak mages in the back row.\n\nAll this is aiding by outstanding enemy AI.  In fact, it's some of the best AI I've ever seen in a turn based, back row/front row RPG.  There is nothing random about the enemy attack or defense patterns.  They will target your weakest characters in the back row with consecutive waves of long range attacks, mercilessly pummel your most badly injured soldiers in the front row, and assign guards to absorb the damage their own mages and healers when you start to significantly hurt them.\n\nAnd of course the main thing that makes this game work is the excellent amount of diverse characters.  They are all quite diverse and unique, and you'll find yourself caring about all of them.  They have a wide range of different skills on the battlefield and different personalities off it, keeping the game immersive and entertaining the whole way through.\n\nThere are a few key weak points.  One is that that amount of characters you get (14) is disproportionate to the number of troops who can take part in battle (6).  It is quite frustratining to have to leave over half your team on the "sidelines" in combat.  Not only that, but the fact that Loren and your playing character have to be involved in almost every fight besides random encounters meant I found myself doing a lot of extra grinding just to keep everyone's levels up to par.  Thankfully this is somewhat mitigated by a large number of "iron man" events where you face a series of consecutive battles without recovering stamina or health between each one, thus forcing you to use your "backup" characters as well as your primary ones.\n\nAlso, while the Amazon culture of Loren is quite unique and interesting, the rest of the game is just an endless series of fantasy cliches:  Dwarves with long beards and big axes, Wizards with long beards, white robes, and big staffs, Elven assasins, a dark lord returned from the dead who seeks to conquer the world for some obscure reason.  Don't ever think of starting a drinking game based on every cliche you find in this game that you've seen before, or you'll become an instant alcoholic.\n\nLoren the Amazon Princess isn't for everyone.  You need to really be into turn based combat, have an active imaginatino to make up for the lack of animation and graphics, and have a high tolerance for generic fantasy worlds full of Elves, Dwarves, and Humans antagonizing each other.  But if those apply to you, then you really can't go wrong with this title.","April 15, 2014","true","55.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The story is well-written and your choices truly influence your experience of the story! This is hands down the best visual novel I've ever played.\n\nI enjoyed it so much the first time on easy mode, playing as the elf female, that I decided on a second playthrough (despite having 100+ other games in my Steam library). Now I'm playing on hard difficulty mode as the human male, making different choices than before, and while the overall story arc is the same, the events and viewpoint are completely different than my first playthrough. And it's such a joy because I didn't know that there was this whole other layer to the game's story until I started playing the second time.\n\nThe turn-based combat is enjoyable as well. The battles are way easy on easy mode, and appropriately anxiety-inducing in hard mode. There's lots of cool skills and spells you can learn as you level up.\n\nThe conversations at the camp with your party members are interesting and can lead to romance if you make the right choices in dialogue. Gay and lesbian relationships are possible. And having no romance is possible.\n\nGraphics, music, sound effects, gameplay mechanics, are all fine.\n\nI highly recommend Loren for lovers of RPGs and visual novels.","November 18, 2014","true","55.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

With that out of the way...\n\nThis game has some beautifully written romance dialogue and a competent RPG combat system with a well-built world and good artwork. Unfortunately it fails at maintaining a coherent portrayal of characters and people are frequently quite stupid in that they ignore obvious alternatives to the current situation. They also run on "RPG logic" in that you can recruit people whom by all means you have no logical reason to keep alive at the time. It's a bad thing when the unlikable jerk bigot is the guy you're agreeing with the most because he's the only one drawing the logical conclusion about what needs to be done.\n\nAside that, the narration's writing is quite amaturish and falls prey to a number of mistakes that, with time and some proper guidance, can be avoided in the future.\n\nAll in all I can't recommend this game to either RPG fans or Visual Novel fans unless you have a high tolerance for characters making stupid statements when they should by all rights be smarter than that. A lot of great potential was here and some of that was even lived up to, but the fact that some of that potential is lived up to makes the shortcomings all the more painful.","January 28, 2015","false","14.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, it does provide an enjoyable, unique niche experience that you won't find elsewhere. Edit: I keep editing this review the more I play it, and even after my intitial review after ten hours of a playthrough. The real value in this game is the replayability and finding all the the many different really enjoyable circumstances that is unique to each character and each choice. Those who like Dragon Age: Origins will really enjoy the variable characters and shennanigans they get into, I know I am more and more :) Now we return to the rest of the review ^-^\n\nForgive the unorganized mess of comments that constitutes my review :)\n\n-Combat isn't a total drag, however the character-specific jobs are very similar, failing to add a different flare to combat when I choose a Necromancer over a Mage or even Archmage. Considering the older and free flash game Monster's Den series has more useful variations within the same style of conducting combat, it's very poor.\n\n-Writing on average is good/tolerable with it occassionally resembling a bad anime or fanfiction, or making you genuinely feel for the characters.\n\n-The story is good. It trivializes itself by coming to a boil so quickly, leaving you altogether lukewarm about the broader story elements.\n\n-Romances are diverse as are the characters you romance, providing different events based on their personalities which makes it enticing to select the "Romance" conversation option for every character just for the good times.\n\n-The lore and the world is not bad.\n\n-The game is a little too aware of it's own morality, training you into a very neutral diplomat, which is all well and good but you never invest yourself. You'll never find yourself fervently championing a cause before gradually coming to question yourself or standing true in spite of the opposition's morality, making the moral battles essentially moot.\n\n-Characters are fairly well made.\n\n-I HAVE to hate on the scantily clad character models. One or two are justified in the story and it further contributes to their characters overall, but everyone rushing into battle in metal tankinis is just flat out rediculous. It cheapens romances, making you feel like you've lined up hookers that you would ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, and are now hiring based on their life and personality, instead of discovering romance between your character and another. It's awkward and completely unncessary.\n\n-Very cool and very enjoyable approach to same gender romance. In my playthrough I have seen nothing that has made it clear that it's just a cheap marketing ploy.\n\n-The dialogue system is completely out of whack. Be ready to save before every dialogue, because you are going to get some weird responses with the obscure Joking, Friendly, Serious, motiff.","January 20, 2014","true","21.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

However, it isn't nearly as polished and lacks the twists and depth of DAO had. I wasn't expecting it to be perfect, but it certainly fell short of expectations.\n\nMost of the characters in this game don't have varied dialogue styles. As a result, they come off as having been written by the same person. Rather than having distinguishing characteristics, they seem very archetype based and lack further depth. Dialogue choices don't really give the player a feeling of control or influence in the game, unlike in DA:O.\n\nThe gameplay is largely uninteresting. The game has two parts: dialogue and encounters. The former tends to feel forced-- some of the dialogue scenes are better written than others, but overall one tends to feel railroaded and loses very little skipping through dialogue scenes to the end.\n\nEncounters are largely predictable, especially once having settled into a routine. Turn based dice rolling with few animations makes encounters a matter of how fast you can spam commands to get through them. There is no overhead positioning strategy, simply front and back rows and a few types of combination attacks.\n\nFor the price, I would say this game is not worth it. If it came down, it might be.","May 25, 2014","false","124.7"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

First things first, I've played a few visual novels - Analogue, Hate Plus, and the school-related one by the same author. Those were all great.\n\nLoren has long, boring conversations evident immediately from the beginning. The story and dialogue reads like someone's sexual fanfiction with the rampant sexism that seems to be portrayed for laughs or as of no consequence and blatant relationships that feel less like hero and loyal servant (like Frodo and Sam) and more like bizarre dom/sub sexual fetishism. If that isn't enough, this is where Loren, the titular hero, seems incredibly naive up-to-and-including the fact that she doesn't know who her city's nearest neighbour is.\n\nThe writing is so cringe-inducing that I didn't even get to try the combat system.

The story is your classic "Dungeon and Dragons vs demonic evil," but it goes little beyond that.\n\nEvents often made little to no sense-For example, your naive warrior princess walk into a bar...start a fight, kill 6 town's guards. No repercussion. 5 minutes later, the evil goblin lord showed up at your bedroom, start a fight...and after his minion dies, transform their corpses into town's guards...and then you are arrested. And of course, no need for any sense of mystery: cue to the dark lord sitting on a volcano with his succubus.\n\nIt couldn't get more cliched if the princess end up finding a magic sword that made her the choosen one...wait, she do that too within like 10 mintues into the game.\n\nFrankly, this is like straight out of a saturday morning cartoon from the 90s.\n\nThe other problems include:\n\n-Too many NPCS-Most RPG these days let you update your "bench team" with exp even if they weren't in the fight. Thus avoiding certain NPCs falling behind. Not this game. They gave you 6 slots, but in the 2.5 hours I played this game I already encountered at NPCs. So at least two guys would have to be "benched" or constantly rotated.\n\n-Stats don't appear to matter beyond the "primary stats-\n\nSo to be honest, a cliched story, a poor designed game mechanic is definitely not worth $20.","November 10, 2014","false","2.5"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","11","21","0","0"

I would like to start by saying that I have never played a visual novel based game before, and I generally try to avoid reading a lot of dialogue in games. Usually, I just like going in for the action, the loot, etc.\n\nHowever, Loren The Amazon Princess has changed that. I really love how the story is turning out. I also like how the characters are alive! There is a lot of emotion and detail in how characters interact with each other. It really brings you into the world.\n\nOnce you start playing the game you just cannot put it down.

It's mostly a visual novel game, with some RPG aspects mixed in, and they worked quite well together. It was easy to immerse myself in the game as both the setting and the characters were interesting. The story itself is not enthralling, but it's good enough to keep you playing to see it through to the end. The visuals are appealing, and, like many other VNs, some background images are reused. The music was nice and fitting for the setting. The length was appropriate for the price; I logged just over 20 hours on my first playthrough playing in hard mode. I only unlocked 18 achievements so there is certainly some replay value.\n\nThe dialogues are not static, and they can change slightly depending on who you're romancing. There is a "camp" option where you can talk to your party members, and new conversations are triggered after certain events. There's also the option of doing personal side quests where more can be learned about the characters. You could also find yourself in a confrontation if you've romanced more than one of them. Some dialogues are a bit cheesy, but nothing bothersome or cringe-worthy. There are a few grammatical errors/typos, but they're very minor and forgettable. Overall, I enjoyed the game and am now looking forward to trying out the other games from the developer.","January 25, 2015","true","37.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I had few issues with the audio. The menu song carried into the game and layered awkwardly with the in-game music. This was fixed by quitting and re-opening the game. I found myself continuously hitting the left mouse button to get a lot of cliche dialogue out of the way. After a couple of hours, I didn't care which dialogue option I hit anymore because it didn't seem to matter. The player character is very preachy and naive. The only reason this game has held my interest for so long is the battle system. Don't get me wrong, it's cut and dry, but it is fun. You just have to wade through uninteresting conversations between one-note characters to get to the battles.The one thing that drove me absolutely nuts is the fact that you usually can't pick your full party. What I mean by that is the slave character and Loren ALWAYS have to be in the party. It's annoying and limits strategy. The last point I'd like to make is that it is half-‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• in all departments. You can easily predict the story, the characters are one note, romantic interest is triggered by hitting a button labelled "romance", you play second fiddle to a total ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• (Loren) and it's hard not to lose interest. It's weak as a dating sim, it's weak as a story and it's weak as a game.","October 20, 2015","false","9.2"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","9","18","0","0"

The art style was nice, though I would've liked to see more stills from special scenes in the game. While the story isn't that original, I did like that it tells the story from the point of view of someone other than the "Chosen One." The characters were interested, & I found the writing particularly compelling in the last two chapters. I also have to give the writers credit for doing a good job of writing a romance that actually adds to the story development rather than just feeling tacked on... on least in the romance option I picked.

If you want to find all the endings, the Story Mode/Skip Seen Dialogue combo is amazing, and will keep your head from exploding from all the repetition.\n\nYes, exploding heads are bad... <-- name that badly re-worded reference!\n\nAnd while we're referencing it, yes - this can be compared to Dragon Age, although it's much smaller in scale.\n\nThere's a system where certain decisions you make will effect the ending. I think some of the added content from the Deluxe Version also has an effect?\n\nAnd then there's the romance options. There are 6 in the regular version, 8 in the Deluxe Version, with different combinations of GxB, GxG, and BxB. 4 of the romance options prefer either Saren or Elenor, but the other 4 are open to either character you choose. And, if you romance someone, it's reflected in how the Epilogue changes.\n\nThe dailogue is really well-done too. Dependinging on whether you choose Friendly, Joking, or Forceful, you get different reactions from people, and most of it is pretty entertaining. :)\n\nThe biggest difference between the two games is the battle system. In Loren it's turn based, like what you would see in an older Final Fantasy set-up.\n\nI definitely suggest getting the Deluxe Version of this game. Without it, there are 4 characters you won't get (2 of which are romance options).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yosituna/recommended/257970/","yosituna","yosituna","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yosituna/","141 products in account","One of the more fun indie games I've played recently, with nice 2D art and fun, albeit not incredibly original, RPG story and gameplay. This is a hybrid visual novel and RPG, which is an unusual combination and not for everyone; however, if either of those genres appeals to you, or you enjoy character-driven RPGs with romance options (such as Bioware's RPGs), it's definitely worth a try.\n\nWinter Wolves clearly takes bits and pieces from other game series they like; the game it is perhaps most indebted to is Dragon Age: Origins, as the camp system holds definite parallels, and the ability icons look like they could have been taken directly from that game. The story is fairly pedestrian high-fantasy, though with a few twists (such as playing not the destined hero, but her sidekick), and while the turn-based combat system is quite polished for an indie RPG, it offers nothing incredibly new.\n\nThat said, while Loren is not the most innovative game in gameplay or plot, its mixture of VN and RPG is much rarer and works for the game. While it's not bringing a ton of new stuff to the table, what it does bring is executed well. The battle system is quite enjoyable (and has adjustable difficulty, which is always nice!) and the characters are overall fairly likable, though any party members you don't romance on a given playthrough - with a few exceptions, such as dwarves Dora and Ramas - will mostly remain ciphers until you do. The romance system is fairly nice, though, giving you a good amount of insight into your chosen character(s); it's also fairly inclusive in its options, with each protagonist (the male human Saren and the female elf Elenor) having four to six potential romance options (in the basegame, one heterosexual, one homosexual, and two bisexual options, divided evenly among genders; the expansion offers two more bisexual romances, one of each gender).\n\nIs it worth it? You can easily finish your first run through the game, doing everything it is possible to do (including DLC) in 15-20 hours, but Loren offers replay value through its multiple endings and romance routes. (It also offers cheats to help speed up replays once you've beaten it once, which is handy.) $20 would be fair for the deluxe version (especially as indie game development can't pay that well), but for just the basegame and no DLC, it's a bit steep. If you do get it, I would definitely recommend getting it via Steam just because it is a little cheaper than buying it from the developer's website. (And if you do buy it via Steam, the version from Winter Wolves' website will unlock itself with everything you have bought here, including DLC.) And the deluxe version of Loren is certainly worth picking up on a Steam sale, at the very least.\n\nP.S. One thing I should probably address is the fanservice outfits. The original version of the game included some rather scanty outfits for several of the main characters that could be changed to more modest covering through a Preferences setting. (Endgame romance scenes also came in near-nude/clothed versions.) The Steam version does not have this enabled, so you will by default be playing the covered-up version. That said, if you want the fanservice outfits, it's fairly simple; just download the demo from the developers' website, which will automatically unlock the full game and/or DLC if you've bought them through Steam, and then use that version to change the settings and save. Since the Steam and WW versions both share the location for saves and settings, changing the one will affect the other, and your Steam install will now have the fanservice outfits. (You'll have to go back to the WW version if you want to change back to the modesty outfits, but as you'll see, it's a fairly minor thing to have to do.)","June 18, 2014","true","20.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Decent replay value, too - Have completed multiple playthroughs.\n\n*Regarding another review that dinged the game for not being child-friendly: Whatever you may think of the art style and description, the game is definitely aimed at adults.  The romance dialogues can veer into M territory, and even the non-romance dialogue and scenarios (themes of leadership, death, making tough decisions, family, racism, war, etc.) may not be well understood or appreciated by younger players.\n\nLonger review:\n\nI can definitely see why other reviewers were making Dragon Age comparisons.  While I enjoyed the battles and the skill systems, the meat of this game is really in the story and the character interactions.  Luckily, the characters tend to be likeable, and there are romance options for many tastes and preferences.  You also generally have three different "moods" to respond in dialogue - "Joking," "Friendly," and "Forceful."  Choosing enough of one type over the course of the game will actually change how your character speaks and reacts in general, which is really cool.  This means that if, for example, you were to do two playthroughs as the female protagonist, even though her name and appearance don't change, it still *feels* like you are playing as a different character if you make different dialogue decisions.  Also, other characters will react differently to you based on which of the two protagonists (female elf or male human) you choose.\n\nAs for combat, it is quite well-designed and enjoyable enough that I did some grinding just for the heck of it, but don't expect twitch-action/3D character models/etc.: The battles are purely turn-based (see the screenshots for an idea) and can be as deep or as shallow as you'd like, based on the difficulty.  On Hard, you will definitely have to pay attention to party composition and tactics, and there are many status effects and combos you can use (or have used on you).\n\nDifficulty is almost completely determined by whether you choose Easy, Normal, or Hard, and seemed to be very well balanced, without any crazy spikes or seemingly unfair fights.  Easy is a total walk in the park, Normal is fair, and Hard is, well, hard.  Luckily, you can change difficulties on the fly (even mid-battle) if you are finding it too hard or too easy (or you want to get the achievements for beating certain bosses on hard without doing a whole playthrough that way...).\n\nGame length will vary based on your investment in the game (how often you visit camp to speak with party members, how many side quests you complete, etc.) and how quickly/carefully you read the dialogue, but if I had to slap a number on it, I'd say 15-20 hours for a first playthrough on Normal difficulty.\n\nIn conclusion, I would happily recommend this, especially to fans of turn-based RPGs and/or visual novels.  Also, if you have played and liked other Winter Wolves games, I believe this to be one of their best (perhaps THE best), so you should go ahead and pick this up!","January 9, 2015","true","37.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The classic 'good guys vs evil powerful king' kind of story, it's pretty enjoyable if you're into that. My only gripe with the general storytelling and the social progression of the game was how often my party proved to be naive, optimistic and painfully altruistic everytime they engaged... anyone really. But maybe that's because I've built up my character to be "friendly" rather than "forceful" or "joking". If that is why, then that's awesome.\n\nSome more freedom and a variety of choices would've been very welcome, but alas, the only choices you get mainly revolve around "romance between the characters" which is pretty SFW and mild while excessively flirty and LGBT-friendly if I may add - merely fillers much like in Mass Effect franchise and not too focused on as it would be in a "dating sim".\n\nThe art style is very simplistic yet just as pleasing to the eye, well.. my eye at least. The backgrounds and music is well done (most of the time) and the general atmosphere is just great.. and again, very LOTR-ish (but not as massive and majestic perhaps).\n\nAs for the gameplay, it pretty much consists of navigating through a map, picking some choices that rarely affects the main storyline (I suppose they focused on character development more than interactivity) and the rest is pretty much JRPG style turn-based battles.\n\n\n\nI'd say it's quite good for a visual novel game, it's worth the money and I'd recommend it. But if you're not into visual novels, I doubt you'll enjoy this one bit.\n\nEdit: Forgot to add, it's pretty lengthy too, can't really finish the whole thing in one go unless you skip every dialogue and such, and the game does have some replayability thanks to the character development, but not a huge factor in that on it's own.","August 31, 2014","true","8.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

To fix this, go to the developer's website, download the free demo, enable mature content, play it until the first battle, save and quit. When you open the Steam version, you'll find the save ready to load and everything will be uncensored!\nYou can choose your main character between a male human and a female elf. You can build their skills and personalities by choosing different answers that yes, will change the story. The choice of the protagonist also affects the romance options, as some characters are straight and gay (although the majority is bi).\nIt's a story-heavy game, which means you'll read a lot. A lot - and you'll love every word of it. I'm not going to spoil anything of the plot, which is actually decent. The writing is also nice (there are some naive falls, like the use of the adjective 'electrocuted'. I doubt that electrocution is a known process in that world, but whatever). I would have enjoyed some more politics in there, but the told parts were in the right spots.\nThe characters are great, all have a backstory and motivations, and you can decide to explore them or just have a glimpse. Just so you know, Draco is AWESOME. Loren is so sexist it's borderline hilarious. I like how the trope of the 21st century gal in Medieval fantasy is subverted :P\nYou have waaaaaay more characters than the 6 needed for your party, but it makes it more fun, you can rotate them. Just remember to keep them with some equip and a weapon because of plot reasons, even those you don't use.\nOnce you complete the game once, a special mode called 'cheat mode' is introduced to replay just the story. You'll win every battle in 1 blow.\nThe combat reminded me of tabletop RPGs. It's pretty simple at the beginning, but the more you progress, the more you need to plan each action, especially at hard mode. Normal mode is still pretty easy.\nAlso... achievements! Soooooo many! And cards, whoop whoop.\n\nI can see my whole family enjoying it for different reasons (and at different difficulty levels... and with censor on ahaha).\nI got it in a sale and now I almost regret it, it's worth the full price. The dev is also really involved in the community and it's great to see such dedication and love.\n\nThe DLC introduces an optional place, the castle of N'Mar, with lots of bosses (who introduce some interesting moral questions), achievements, a slightly different ending and three optional characters (two of them romanceable!). I did expect a bit more considering the price, but it's a nice addition and definitely great to play.\n\nIf you're still unsure, grab the free demo and try it out!","November 9, 2014","true","21.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Humans hate elves, elves hate humans and elves that have a slightly blue tint to their skin color, amazons hate everyone who isn't them and female, and dwarves...are actually kinda chill. The fact that out of every 10 people you meet 9 of them are racist is incredibly annoying. I know there's discrimination in real life but I don't really like discrimination in real life, it's annoying out here and it's annoying in the game. Honestly, I wouldn't mind except this seems to be all it tackles (well, this and sexism if you play as a male). Come on, there's a ton of issues out there to address. There's slavery in this game, why don't we deal with that? Morality vs effeciency? Or democracy vs feudalism? Or religion vs skepticism? Or order vs free spirit? Seriously, there's so many things you can use (and a lot of them are a lot less stupid than racism and sexism. This is a bit personal but these two topic really annoy me because of how there is pretty much no basis for either of them, I prefer social issues that are actually morally conflicting).\nCombat is repetitive on easy, draws on too long on normal, and is impossible on hard. I found myself switching to easy when random encounters lasted 20 minuets, and switching back to normal when every fight consisted of spam special attack. Either I just suck or there really needs to be an easy-ish mode, more transition between the two.\nAnd the outfits...please, please fix the outfits. We're supposed to be playing as heroes, not ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•s. This argument is rather self explanatory, really.\nAlright, now that I've made this game sound absolutely horrible, let me explain why I gave it an thumbs up vote.\nFirst off, there's real consequences to choice. I started two playthroughs (that I never finished because of life), once as a grim human male who was duty first pleasure never, and another as a joking elf lady who used her freegoing words to manipulate others into getting her way. This alone created two almost completely different playthroughs (though it mostly just determined who was racist against me), choosing one over the other opens and closes a ton of doors. I found some choices made during the game created two completely different journeys. Most big budget games don't pull this off.\nThe dialog is also really great. I noticed this more in my sassy elf than my mideval batman playthough, but the words flow really well and can go from being funnier than most comedies nowadays to really dark tragedies, sometimes it feels kinda bipolar but when it works it works.\nFinally, the premise. Make no mistake, this isn't your story. You play an important part, but this is not your story. You are not the main charecter, you are the main charecter's bodyguard. You make sure they can do their main charecter thing but you are not the focus. I LOVE this premise and wish there were more games with it in mind. In this, execution is sloppy at times but overall it does really well making you understand your roll. Lots of people may be turned off by this, even I who love the concept was a bit jealous when Loren picked up the glowing sword, but for me this is a great concept that I'm glad someone took up.\nI wouldn't reccomend buying this at full price, but when it's on sale you are obligated to get it out of self-interest. I hope the creater makes more games like this, maybe with a more refined combat system, less sexualization, and more variety in the social issues it tackles.","November 16, 2014","true","10.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I did enjoy this game. I have a few critical things to say about it but over all I had a good time, I enjoyed the story. The characters, the scenery, the world history all interesting and fascinating. I have a good time uncovering the lore, meeting the new characters, uncovering the new towns and looking over the lovely weapon designs.\n\nOver all I give it a 7/10 for its creativity and interesting story\n\nSPOILERS AHEAD\n\nNow to the critique;\n\nThe story was a bit rushed. You met the characters rather easily and the only lengthening or extension of plot was in combat. Not a bad thing to be sure, a lot of titles do it but there was little to no interparty conflict or even just a consistent note of conviction with each character.\n\nEven when pressed or given something that was supposed to contend with their morals or nature they seemed to acquess quite easily. Even those party members whom were at odds with eachother. Such as Rei and Mesphit, who ever volatile with eachother they still seem to immediatly listen to the people around them making their arguements seem rather stale.\n\nMyrth, when in battle and in conversation with other characters expresses a dislike and abhorrence to violence yet when presented with someone she was at odds with and whated something from, Mesphit or the human wizard (I know his name it is simply rather long and I dont really want to type it), she relents and even agrees to kill, without arguement.\n\nA lot of the characters seem to lack conviction. Not all of them mind but those that do are considered stubborn or evil in their intent. It bothered me a bit the rate at which you could acquire them if your views differed so heavily to the point of open hostility. It stuck with me through the game but since not every character showed quite a lack of will it was fine for the most part.\n\nThere are a few other gramatical problems and simple fixes but like I stated earlier not a bad game.

That being said it is a well thought out story full of fun JRPG style gameplay.\n\nOne of the core complaints regarding this game surround the developer's decision to remove risque content filtering from the offical release. While I understand the decision I feel as though the developers creative license was squashed over something that is essentially nonsense. The "Risque" content is manageable through a simple options selection and is turned off by default. There is nothing "Pornographic" about any of the original content.\n\nThis is a game that is very much story based. The primary themes are focused on basic human interactions suck as Family, Loyalty, Companionship, and Intimacy. The combat portion of the game requires stratagey and can at times be difficult. Art also plays a key role in the presentation of the game. all graphical content is static.

Well written dialogs, good characterization. Many good dialogs are written to adapt to your every choice.\n\nGraphics: 7/10. Art is good, with a few very good drawings, especially if you don't mind mostly-exposed characters naked under skimpy pieces of armor.\n\nStory/World-building: 6/10. consistent story, but not groundbreaking. The plot works and moves in a logical way, it has some twists, but it is essentially predictable. The world is solid, this is the kind of background you'd expect for such a fantasy setting.\n\nRomance: 7/10. Simplistic/obvious options without surprise (just select 'romance' when you're given the opportunity). Though the option is obvious, the dialogs and characters development are well executed. Somehow, the characters are endearing, which keeps an interest to this aspect of the game.\n\nEquipment/Items: 6/10. There are many pieces of equipment that a character can wear. The many armors/weapons/miscellaneous objects are sometimes a bit confusing as of which you should use to upgrade your characters. The limited amount of money and the limited choice in most shops doesn't help (though you can sell the gems and get more money, as I discovered rather late in the game). So the equipment/armor/weapon upgrades are rather few and far between.\n\nCombat system/progression system: 8/10. Good turn-by-turn combat system, with some depth. The choice about the location is only: front-row /back-row. I wish they'd have taken into account the position: left-wing/right-wing, so you'd be more focussed on the opponent you're directly facing. Apart from this (small) reservation, the system is suprisingly well-done, solid, deep and flexible, while being extremely playable. Well-done!\n\nOverall: 7/10. This is not the game of the year, but you can spend a good time with this one. You can maybe play it a few times: it's not long (about 15 hours for one run) and you can try and play it a few times to get to the different endings. Overall, a rather good merge between VN and turn-by-turn fantasy tactical game.\n\nI got this game in sales, at 10 bucks it was a fair price. At 20 bucks, it's a bit expensive for what you get, in my opinion. But with a discount, it can be a good way to spend a few hours in a pleasant way.","February 10, 2015","true","17.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chernobog3/recommended/257970/","Chernobog3","Chernobog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chernobog3/","94 products in account","I'm not usually into visual novel type games, this one caught my attention for the interactive RPG elements spread through out. Rather than passively just watch a story, you do level up, equip your characters, and can make choices that somewhat steer how things go. In truth, it's a game with a lot of character and personality with the unusual design of playing a character largely subordinate to another who occupies a primary hero role. That said, you are not left in the dust and what interactions you chose to have with fellow party members feels reasonably meaningful.\n\nGraphically the game is pleasant although much imagery is reused, with characters only appearing different by facial expressions in dialogue. In combat, everything is largely static headshots so I speak only of the story elements (of which there is a lot). Speaking of the combat, it basically consists of simple actions versus enemy actions- you succeed by exploiting their weaknesses and managing your team's welfare. It's fairly standard and generally not too hard, although if you have a less than suitably team array, some battles will drag on and on (particularly with healer enemies).\n\nThe music is fair, I don't have much criticism to speak of, although it comes and goes abruptly on scene transitions. The spoken dialogue in combat is... not so good. A lot of it is generic or doesn't fit the situation. Hearing one of your party mage's utter "Filthy creature!" or casually talk about getting something to eat after beating on a former/confused ally is off putting.\n\nI think the story was pretty solid. It's largely about racism and overcoming negative perceptions of others to become stronger as a whole. It's a somewhat standard story, but well told. NPCs and the main cast have a lot of personality. You may even choose to engage in romance with some of your party members, but the option comes up when it doesn't make much sense in dialogue- you either follow it when you get the chance, or potentially lose out in the long run.\n\nOne problem I have actually pertains to the choice in the dialogue system. You get the options of 'Joking', 'Friendly' or 'Forceful', but you're given no real idea what your character will actually say in that situation. It's just sort of a guess as to what comes out. I found if I didn't choose Friendly most of the time, the responses of others were usually on the pissy side.\n\nLastly, I have mixed feelings about the ending. In a way, it's a good ending, but depending on what happens, it is also extremely bittersweet and depressing. I don't want to spoil the how's and why's, but let's say I wasn't a fan of the highly vague 'pass or fail' options of the final scenario- characters may or may not be acting out of turn and the choices you're given sometimes don't make sense with the characterizations you knew them to have at the core. It was a very long and frankly emotionally frustrating sequence that made me wish it wasn't there to begin with. To potentially lose characters permanently that I've soaked hours into with very little fanfare was very depressing and unsatisfying. But at least to the game's credit, it made me care outside of game mechanics, to not to want them to die so there is that.\n\nDespite my displeasure with the last sequence, I wouldn't be against playing more Loren (sequel please?) and I intend to go through it again playing the other starting choice. It's a pretty good socially themed fantasy story with a solid build up all throughout.\n\n(About the DLC: Honestly? I didn't feel it added much. The Castle of N'Mar is a very short and limited area which does change how things turn out with the core story, but I didn't feel any of it was too involving or deep. You do get the potential to have a nifty monster companion join the team, although he doesn't contribute to the story in any capacity and is barely acknowledged by the characters. There's also a certain interaction between the major NPCs that should have been addressed, but you get no option to do so- you merely choose who you will kill and that's about it.)","May 4, 2015","true","17.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BusinessRadroach/recommended/257970/","BusinessRadroach","BusinessRadroach","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BusinessRadroach/","65 products in account","While Loren The Amazon Princess is categorized as an RPG, its RPG elements are light for those used to something that focuses on combat like most Western RPGs or even popular JRPGs. However for the developers Winter Wolves, who have in the past mostly developed relatively generic visual novels/dating sims, it is much heavier on actual gameplay than its predecessors. This combat is the standard turn-based combat where speed detirmines the  turn order found in many "retro" JRPGS. You can a multitude of weapons and armor for your characters that can be purchased in stores or recieved as rewards in combat or through completion of character quests which unlock later in the game.\n\nThe meat and potatoes of the game is in your interactions with the characters in your party and how it affects the story's outcome. The plot consists of a relatively standard high-fantasy adventure where a lowly male human or female elf (depending on the character you choose to play as) helps the title character find her lost mother, getting involved in a war between two foreign races along the way.  Dailoge is more like a novel than the dailogue trees found in most Western RPGs, but at many points in the narrative you can choose a response that affects the protagonist's personality. Most of the options involve choosing to be "joking", "friendly", or "forceful" however there are a few times where you make decisions which change the direction of the plot or you can choose a "romance" option. While there is a large focus on romance with several romancable characters of both genders, it is completly optional to the story and is not forced upon the player. While some of the romance options feel a little creepy, there are a few sappy love stories for those who enjoy that kind of thing.\n\nOverall, I would reccoment Loren The Amazon Priness if you would enjoy a light RPG with a simple but sometimes tear-jerking plot and romance options that (for the most part) feel like they are naturally occuring between characters rather than shoe-horned in pulp forced upon you. If you don't care much about relationships or plot in RPGs or can't stand the art style you can find many mechanically better RPGs out there that don't require you to click through hundreds of lines of text and look at 2D sprites.\n\nIf you are looking for simmilar titles from Winter Wolves you could look into Planet Stronghold if you want something with more focus on mechanics than plot or the new game Tales of Avorn: Season of the Wolf for an all-around better RPG experience wich still focuses on narrative set in this universe.","February 13, 2015","true","21.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I felt as though the price was a bit much for what it had, though it also helped make a few things better, story wise. if you plan on playing, you'll probably be somewhat upset at the ending unless you have the DLC, at which then it gives the golden ending.\n\nOverall, it's a good visual novel, great for people starting out in the genre. the battle system is somewhat uneccesary for those interested in the story alone, and the DLC is somewhat neccesary if you want a happy ending.","July 8, 2015","true","11.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The characters, the scenery, the world history all interesting and fascinating. I have a good time uncovering the lore, meeting the new characters, uncovering the new towns and looking over the lovely weapon designs.\n\nOver all I give it a 7/10 for its creativity and interesting story\n\nSPOILERS AHEAD\n\nNow to the critique;\n\nThe story was a bit rushed. You met the characters rather easily and the only lengthening or extension of plot was in combat. Not a bad thing to be sure, a lot of titles do it but there was little to no interparty conflict or even just a consistent note of conviction with each character.\n\nEven when pressed or given something that was supposed to contend with their morals or nature they seemed to acquess quite easily. Even those party members whom were at odds with eachother. Such as Rei and Mesphit, who ever volatile with eachother they still seem to immediatly listen to the people around them making their arguements seem rather stale.\n\nMyrth, when in battle and in conversation with other characters expresses a dislike and abhorrence to violence yet when presented with someone she was at odds with and whated something from, Mesphit or the human wizard (I know his name it is simply rather long and I dont really want to type it), she relents and even agrees to kill, without arguement.\n\nA lot of the characters seem to lack conviction. Not all of them mind but those that do are considered stubborn or evil in their intent. It bothered me a bit the rate at which you could acquire them if your views differed so heavily to the point of open hostility. It stuck with me through the game but since not every character showed quite a lack of will it was fine for the most part.\n\nThere are a few other gramatical problems and simple fixes but like I stated earlier not a bad game. I know its a few years out now so I reserve judgement on that front since there have been other games.\n\nAll in all however, would play again and I can not wait to see what the more recent games that have some out have in store.\n","June 20, 2015","true","32.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheWolfOfTexas/recommended/257970/","TheWolfOfTexas","Wolf Steel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheWolfOfTexas/","86 products in account","Browsing through Steam. Bored out of my mind, wanting a good game to pass the weekend. Find this hidden gem randomly. See a few good reviews. Buy it around noon.\n\nTwelve hours later -- straight mind you, no interruptions since install point -- and it's 1:15 AM. I'm asking where my Saturday went. The game took me for a ride and held time hostage, and I didn't even try to negotiate its relase.\n\nThe story is very enthralling. The characters have true flesh and blood to them. I enjoy the interactions I experience. I'm not even aware of my own perspective regarding the decisions and reactions from my party, I'm so wrapped up in the mentality of the PC and the persona that I've become augmented with. I'm having to force myself to step away for a break, lest I end up impacting my health from refusing to put down this novel of an RPG.\n\nTo call this game a visual novel mixed with an RPG doesn't do it justice. That's to imply that, in my opinion, a visual novel is expected to have high quality writing and a caliber of a story that's beyond an RPG. To me, this game is the very definition of what a -role- playing game should be as. Your emotions are stimulated time and time again. It pains me to find the lack of words to properly describe how I feel about my experience with this game, for I'm not a great enough writer to convey it.\n\nThe gameplay its self, surprised me. It's simple to understand, easy to walk into. This could be your first RPG ever, and you'll feel very comfortable with how fights play out just after a few encounters. You find what works best for your tastes easily, but you're not forced to stay in this comfort zone. Branching out and trying new methods and testing out new ideas is easy. The game permits you to play safely, while at the same time presenting you with a challenge each step of the way. You can see what best affects your enemy, and what your general damage will be. You will never enter a fight you can't win, and at times you will find minor fights off on the side that your party will merely laugh at as they effortlessly dispatch them. That is because you are rewarded for finding an effective style of fighting, while you'll still find the fights progressed by the main story constantly challenging you. There will never be one set perfect way to end a fight. Being versatile and adaptive will ensure constant victory without defeat, but you will be testing yourself as much as your own heroes throughout the game.\n\nYou might notice I didn't talk too much about the mechanics -- that's intended. The fights play out like some of the "classics" of the RPG series that Final Fantasy inspired. You have your statuses, your weaknesses, your damage types, your weapon types, so on and so forth. The options to pick from range as wide as you'd want. There's ways to farm up gold from fights if you desire to gear your party to the teeth for each encounter, but you have to explore and test and discover what's the best way for you to earn your gear and gold. I won't spoil that for you.\n\nTo conclude, this game is a work of art. Whatever doubts I had of this game were washed away within moments of playing this game. If you desire a game driven by a story that permits you to influence both the outcome of the events, and the progression of the characters through the actions of your PC and the decisions they make, all while staying organic and natural, to be topped off with a solid combat experience that feels rewarding and challenging every step of the way, this game is a perfect pick for you.\n\nI must highligh, you get to make several decisions in the game. Majority of the time, for your character. A few instances, for others. In my opinion, each instance had a natural progression to each stage you encounter. The outcomes felt "real". They don't feel forced, or awkward. In part due to the quality of each character's personality and behavior, in part to the amazing effort put into writing every line of dialogue. I have yet to find a single issue I could mention of this game. If I had to pick a "perfect video game", this would be at the top of my list.","August 15, 2015","true","16.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/candesco/recommended/257970/","candesco","Candesco","http://steamcommunity.com/id/candesco/","100 products in account","First of all a little warning: this ain't the same like Legend of Grimrock, an other indie title where you can set up a party. You don't move the characters yourself here. It's more like the Eador games, in terms of gameplay. With the exception that this is a rpg (eador is strategy). So expect here alot of interactive pages instead of a world where you can move yourself. It's more a visual novel with some mechanics (like equip stuff).  If interactive pages bothers you and you rather want to make the action yourself, then skip this game.\n\nLoren is at first sight an interesting game. Rather then the hero itself you take the role of a servant (or more a slave actually)\nThat will be either a human male or an elven female. After you have chosen one of those you then choose a class. A little complaint here. You can choose between warrior or thief. No option of chosing a mage, which is a bummer.\nYou can then go to the castle or shop already, but main thing is the saving of the queen. So you soon leave. That's where the story begins then. It is divided into acts. You first begin in act I and the mainquest is saving queen karen. There are sometimes also some sidequests and you will also run into random encounters (which i know myself from neverwinter nights II). You also meet other people on your way and some of them will join your party. A good thing i find is the choices you have to made. At a certain moment you got into trouble and 2 partymembers offer each a solution. So which way do you go?\nThe choice changes how the story will continue. You will encounter this more.  Often there is also an option of how you will react on a situation. You then have the choice of joking, friendly and forceful. Sometimes also romance, which happens often at places where a bed is (tavern for example). It reminds indeed a bit to the later action games like Mass Effect.\nAnd although it are only 3 options the outcome is different. I don't agree that this is tedious. It's just part of the game. That it doesn't always turn well makes it more interesting.\nGoing to the next destination goes through a map, which reminds to neverwinter nights or the king's bounty games. But here you also have the option to going to a camp. At the camp you can talk with your party, including your master. This is actually very similar to the taverns in NWN or the campsite in Dragon Age:Origins.\nThe combat here goes in turns, much like the King's Bounty games, only you don't have here a field. Instead just a page.\nThere is one thing that bothers me. The claim of being hardcore and keeping old school rpg's alive with this game is a bold claim and also not true. Don't get me wrong, Loren the amazon princess is quite a fun game. But it's not the same like alltime classics as Planescape:Torment and Baldur's Gate. it's even not the same as Neverwinter Nights or Legend of grimrock.\nIt ain't much hardcore. Still, i don't think that casual players will like it, as it ain't casual either. You have to think sometimes, especially when it comes to fighting. And probably casual players don't like numbers and that you have to allocate them.\nIf it's worth it's price? From what i see so far i think so. And it's cheaper here on steam then on the site of the developer, which ask ‚Ç¨5 more. I think ‚Ç¨19 ain't bad, if you keep in mind that Eador: Master's of the broken world is also around that price and managing games like Football Manager from sports interactive cost even triple the price, while that one is just spreadsheets.","February 12, 2014","true","16.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I've made it through one playthrough and have to stop so I can get caught up on a bunch of work :P\n\nI really enjoyed the story, and just how many options there are (that whole replayability factor) for dramatically altering the storyline.  The battles also were not tedious, and there was no pointless grinding--unless you wanted to do so.\n\nThere were a few things that could have been fine-tuned a bit more, but while they were slightly annoying, they weren't enough to keep me from enjoying the game.  These included:\n\n1) Buying equipment for the party, especially when it gets big, is a little tedious.  You have little checks that appear above each character's head if they can equip a piece.  However, you have to click on each character, then hover over each piece of equipment before you can see whether it's worth the investment.  On top of that, it's hard to keep the names of different pieces of equipment straight, so you're constantly checking the same pieces on the same characters.  A few things that would help with this are: a) no checks above a character if they have a piece equipped, b) something like a plus or minus indicator above a character's head, instead of the check, to show whether or not the piece of equipment is an improvement on what they already have, and c) stores that have set pieces of equipment.  Half the time, you exit out of a store, go back in, and hey, totally different equipment--and guess, what?  It's better than what you just bought.\n\n2) Some sort of indicator that shows, when you camp, whether or not someone has something to say to you.  I don't know how many times I clicked through every character only to have them give me the standard reply.\n\n3) The skill point system.  Sure, I'd love to have more points, like a point on every level, but that's probably not realistic :P  The bigger issue was the interconnectedness of leveling up skills.  I don't know how many times I wanted the next level of X skill, but it wasn't available until i unlocked Y & Z skills, which were skills I didn't want.  So essentially, you end up wasting those valuable skill points in order to finally get the skill you really wanted.\n\nBut really, this is a fantastic game for those who love the story part of rpgs, but can't do the action combat that so many of them have turned to.   Now, if only they could figure out how to port the old-school jrpgs into mac verstions :P","June 24, 2014","true","25.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is a high fantasy rpg/choose your own adventure mix and for the most part it pulls it off.  The combat consist of your party versus an enemy party with both sides selecting abilities and targets in a turn-based manner. It ranges from serviceable to enjoyable depending on how long you've been playing but by the time your done you'll be edging toward boredom with the combat. That's not to say there's aren't tactic elements but the bare graphics and simplistic but perfectly functional U.I eventually get old. It also has some romance elements that are entirely optional and not a core part of the story.\n\nOther minor things to note. The basic sound effects aren't terribly good and I found myself listening to music within the first couple of hours. Characters are for the most enjoyable but one of my biggest issues is how the best one is part of the DLC. In fact, the DLC feels incredibly core to the main game to the point where I wouldn't recommend it without it. It adds much to the ending, a large side-quest and a significant number of characters to your party.\n\nPros\n-Cool Characters and enjoyable story.\n-Choose your own adventure style decision trees.\n-Function core gameplay.\n\nCons\n-DLC feels very much part of the main game. Would not recommend playing without.\n-Combat can become tedious after many hours.\n-Lack of animated graphics.\n-Bad audio effects.\n\nClosing Thoughts: The time I spent playing the game was very enjoyable but the price might be slightly too high all things considered. Would absolutely recommend picking it up if it ever goes on sale and purchasing at full price if this game's core elements sound appealing to you.","July 24, 2014","true","13.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I definitely recomend playing. Its written very well and the character development is something I enjoyed immensely, especially the the relationship development between Elenor and Karen ;)\nBut if I had to choose the games biggest fault I would have to say it was the way you select how to respond in conversations.\nA lot of the time when interacting with party members your given three choices Joking, Friendy, or Forceful. Oh and Romantic as a forth for some conversations. My only issue with this is you really don't know what you're going to say so you might have to go back and do it over if you don't like the way the conversations is going. At least you don't necessarily have to reload every time to do so. You can use the mouse wheel or pg up/down. Other then that the conversations are still plenty interesting. As for the battles, they wern't too bad. The mages use their aoe spells and your front row can pretty much mop up any thing thats left.

It is fantastic!  The writing is excellent.  If you have any doubts, you should jump on this game when it is on sale.  Knowing what I know now, I would pay full price.  Try the demo first, if you like this style of game, do not hesitate to buy it, as it only gets better.  The store vs inventory management system takes a while to get used to and could be helped by putting two columns of pictures instead of one and making that column scrollable via mouse wheel, and by being able to see store and inventory at same time to better compare items. As it is now you can hover over items in the store to see what they can wear and the changes in stats.  If you play it on hard most of the fights are still fairly easy to win, but there are the occassional boss fights that are difficult. Also you will eventually be forced by the story lines to use most if not all of your characters so you can't just focus on buyng the best things for some of them and only using the ones you prefer.  I have played it all the way through and it took me about 2 days, so there is a lot of content.

The short version: Loren has a solid story with an unusual narrative frame, charming characters, and fun combat, but is bogged down by writing that feels like its own clunky fan-fiction, and stagnant art that lacks much appeal or variety. I want to like it more than I do, though, because it has a great deal of enthusiasm, and tries very, very hard.\n\nIn the game's favor:\n\n-Far and away the best thing in my opinion is the combat, which is run on a fairly straightforward, but well executed turn-based system. While it doesn't take long to figure out the resistances and vulnerabilities of each form of enemy, and the scope of the game itself is fairly limited, the instances are varied enough to keep things interesting, and encourage balanced party rotation at the same time.\n-One of the reasons I bought the game was a review that mentioned how unusual it is for an RPG to position the player character as the support of, rather than the story's main hero. It's a unique narrative frame that raises Loren above the ordinary for me, one which I felt granted the freedom to switch up my own playstyle a bit. Being the story's hero usually precludes making narrative sense of being the main healer/squishy support character in the party. Being the hero's bodyguard made trying on that role feel natural, even as the game leaves the door open to play as something else.\n-The game aims to be friendly and inclusive to all players, and while it didn't wholly succeed for me (explained below), the effort is praiseworthy.\n-The characters are, for the most part, charming, albeit a little bit flat.\n-The story is also charming, though it reads at times a little bit like Xena Warrior Princess plays Dragon Age Lite in Middle Earth.\n\nWhat worked less well, in my opinion:\n\n-The writing itself: while the story and characters felt (for the most part) solid, the prose felt clunky and under-edited, with awkward diction, a handful of spelling errors, and more than a handful of convoluted sentences. The "romance" sequences in particular read like heavy-handed, if enthusiastic, fan fiction, and only a few characters really seemed to have a voice of their own that didn't blur together without the aid of a name tacked above the dialogue.\n-The art in the game was close to a deal-breaker for me. Admittedly, I'm not crazy about the design, but my gripe is less with the style, and more that it felt shortchanged. The repeated character, enemy, and set designs, the half-hearted, limited range of expressions, and the overall utter lack of variety felt very chintzy; if you don't have animation available to you in this very visual medium, what you do have has to make up for it in beauty and background. What I found instead felt like a collection of xeroxed paper dolls without any clothes, and with maybe six postcards to pose them against. Potential party members can be immediately identified by their ability to blink, a quirk that is rendered even more bizarre by being the ONLY animation in the game (unless one counts scooting one paper doll across the screen towards another during violent/romantic encounters).\n-The art and writing, Part II: I hate bringing this up, because I do feel the game tries so hard to be friendly to all players, but... I started out the game and almost immediately shut it off when I realized that not only was Elenor stuck in absurd midriff-bearing armor (something I hear might be altered by the so-called 'censor mode'?), but every woman I encountered apparently shared the same disregard for her innards staying in. Finding one of the first male party members readjusted my thinking from "Ick, this is a bit too male-gaze-y for me", to "Ah, nope, just generally gaze-y". By the end of the game it was back to "Okay, so it's just *mostly* male-gaze-y", because one lumbering, shirtless barbarian does not balance out the Grand Canyon expanse of elf and nymph cleavage I faced, and certainly it couldn't stand against Jul's prominent, perky buttocks splayed across my screen (shout out to Ye Gods of Great Timing for encouraging my husband to come into the room just then). The writing, too, often felt as though it expected me to be more interested in Loren than I was, even as it provides a variety of other optional romantic interests, accommodating multiple sexualities; providing those options is excellent, but the effort is diluted when it feels the game still expects you to like Loren best. I'll only add that one of the potential love triangles involves a mother-daughter pairing, and leave it at that.\n-While I understand that this is an indie project and I want to support it, I wasn't enamoured with the fact that the main game, not content with a large-font, title page ad, introduces two prominent characters clearly intended as party members (they blink and everything!) that are only available with the expansion. It's a cheap move that infuriates players when done by big name developers, and I find it similarly unbecoming in a smaller development.\n\nTo conclude (if you made it this far!): I don't know that I'd recommend this to a friend, as I don't have many that share my love of RPGs that I wouldn't be too embarassed by the writing/art to suggest it to-- but I'd travel back in time to recommend it to myself again when it was on sale last month, as good intentions count for a lot, and I did enjoy it enough to finish, cringing and all.","January 24, 2015","true","21.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The different characters always appear in the same pose with the same clothes, only their expression varies. It's made particularly obvious by the fact that you're always changing their equipment and it doesn't change a thing on their visual.\n- Expensive\n- The story is classical heroic-fantasy. Big bad guy, group of heroes, saving the world. Nothing new here.\n- Steam version is censored (luckily, Steam version isn't the only one)\n\nMay be bad/ may be good:\n- It's a visual novel. Some players like it, some others just hate it. It just depends of the player.\n- A lot of fan-service. Read "a lot of visible skin". Many people complained about it. I personally have nothing against nudity, quite the contrary actually. I admit it's a bit stupid to go fight with huge shoulder plates without protecting the belly, but that's standard heroic-fantasy. The main difference with other titles is that they usually add a layer of fabric, but that doesn't protect from blades either.\n\nThe good:\n- Even if it's primarily a visual novel, it doesn't forget to be a true RPG. The turn-based combats are nothing new, but they are tactical and work very well.\n- The musics are cool.\n- Though the story is a bit dull, the writing is very good and the characters are original and nicely fleshed out. It's actually pretty gripping to read.\n- Probably the best of all: fan-service for everyone. Females in skimpy clothing ? Check. Males in skimpy clothing ? Check. I think it's the first game where I see such an equal treatment. Also, you can play either as a guy or a girl, and whatever this choice, you can romance people from both sexes. Finally...\n\nI actually really liked the game. It's a bit expensive, but for a game with equal treatment in terms of fan-service, I'm more than happy to pay full price. Especially when the game really is fun.","February 17, 2015","true","0.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

What's worth mentioning is that, while the story attemps to show all these inner and social conflicts, the cliche bad guys on the other hand reveal a daunting naivity of the character design.

Didn't expect much, just was happy to have something to kill time until servers came back up.\n\nAnd I didn't touch D3/WoW for a week. Loren really surprised; the story isn't going to win any awards but it is interesting enough to keep you wanting to know what happens next. The party members, while very trope-tastic, are fun and I had several laugh out loud moments between them. Using the demo workaround you can also get the suggestive content back in the game, which is nice.\n\nThe combat is a bit ho-hum. Unless you seriously gimp yourself somehow it's pretty simple to just stack your part with a few "good" characters and breeze through every battle, even bosses, who rarely felt like an actual boss as opposed to a mob with slightly more health. However, I played this game to have a story to engage in, so this didn't bother me.\n\nIs Loren worth 20 bucks? Eh. I think WW deserves 20 for what is put into the game; it took me some 30 hours to beat my first playthrough so there's a significant amount of content which surprised me from the look of the game. However, I don't think I'd personally pay 20 for the game; wait for a sale but when it is on sale definitely pick up Loren!","April 21, 2014","true","31.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Memorable! Hearing these songs will stir up memories!\nArt Style Its very good I enjoyed the style. Matchs the atmosphere and music well.\nStory I thought the story was good. The lore they go into was well done.\nWriting I enjoyed it for the most part but I felt this was the only area the game didn't shine. It was above average.\n\n\nI really can't say too much about the game without giving it away. Loren The Amazon Princess is an interactive role-playing visual novel with a squad based RPG combat system. The game has sex appeal. There are a lot of romance options though I believe its 1 character per playthough... although once you complete the game you unlock a sort of cheat mode which lets you bypass a majority of the battles and speed through dialouge.\n\nI honestly liked the combat. A lot. Playing on hard mode gave me a challange in many enounters. It forced me to grind a little bit and seek out good weapons. I felt the story was very good! A lot happened though it does present itself in a casual way. The author goes to great pains to describe what a character is thinking and feeling or to explain their actions. Sometimes I felt this got in the way. I would have liked the style to be a bit more mature though. Even adult oriented in some places. But I am happy with what I was given All in all, Loren The Amazon Princess will always have a special place in my heart. The DLC is actually really good and I would encourage you to get it.\n\nDownsides? Its expensive. Sure its one guy. Sure he wants to make a living off the game. That's cool. Does not change the fact that its still a little expensive. And the writing issue, as I keep saying... which is not a very large gripe actually. Just the only flaw worthy of discussing a bit.\n\nLoren The Amazon Princess gets a solid 5 out of 5 for me!

This is one of my all-time favorite games and the main reasons are:\n\n1) The characters and storyline.\nLoren's cast is extremely memorable, likeable, fleshed-out and well-written.  You will really feel for these characters.  Some you'll love, others you'll love to hate. ;)  The story is overall nothing you haven't seen before, but the well-done execution and vibrant characters really make it come alive.\n\n2) The replay value.\nThere are tons of branching choices to be made, tons of different romances, and several different possible endings (buying the N'Mar DLC adds even more endings!).  I've had this game for about a year and I still haven't seen every ending, branch,  and bit of plot or interesting conversation it has to offer.  There are a variety of places to visit and things to do, and a lot of little secrets and interesting tidbits you can uncover when backtracking to places you've already visited.\n\n3) The art.\nThe general art style of the game remains as in the screenshots, a sort of blend between manga and Western comic-book style.  Somehow it works surprisingly well, and the artist is very talented at creating gorgeous characters.  You will want to romance these cast members.\n\nI could go on really, but the point is that Loren is a great game and well worth your money!","January 16, 2014","true","0.6"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

I didn't even know I had it until I was bored one day, looking through my games list, and wondered what this game was all about. I say this at the start because I knew nothing at all about this game when loading it up for the first time.\n\nWith that being said: I hate having to read through games. So you already know why I do not recommend this title. I buy books and magazines to read. I buy games to play and be spoken to. I love choose your own adventure books, but I don't like reading in a video game. Sorry.\n\nHowever! I do like the graphics, the story was interesting-ish, and the combat was fun albeit dated. As games go you could do a lot worse. My bigest gripe are the skills. I decided to play as a theif, but none of the theif skills are relevant, unless an enemy is already suffering from a previous condition. And guess what? The theif does not have skills that induce the conditions you need to use the skills you have! WTH's up with that?\n\n\nAfter realizing this was a reading game I decided to keep playing just for the achievements. Nearly 2 hours of playtime and not one achievement. Halfway through I got bored and started hitting the Return key to bypass all the text. Even still I only fought in 3 encounters the whole time. So there's a lot to read, but not a lot to play.

The interface is very bear-bones, and the whole game basically boils down to "fight battle" -> "read talking head story" -> "buy stuff in town" -> "grind a few subquests" -> "fight story battle" -> "dating sim."  Theres nothing other than "in town" screen, "in camp" screen, the battles, and the relationship game.\n\nAll this I'd be OK with normally.  I loved the old Nippon Ichi SRPG's.  The stripped down format can shed off some of the unneccessary drags from rpgs and let you focus on the core of the gameplay.  But with Loren TAP, that's not really such a good thing.  The battle system is a very generic RPG style "front row/back row" style fight, with nothing really new or interesting.  Not only is it unoriginal and is almost completely unanimated, but its fairly easy as well.  I beat the first three bosses, and all of the scrub fights in between, and only ever had someone die once, and they were ressurected by the next turn.  I never came anywhere close to losing a fight.... on hard.\n\nThe story line is mediocre, and the romance/dating sim is lame.  The whole point of a Dating sim/relationship system is to pick your dialog options carefully given what you know about the characters personality.  In this game, you only get the options "Joking", "Friendly", or "Forceful."  And since you don't know what is actually going to be said, its a total crapshoot.  I often picked what I thought would be the right option, only to have my character say something that was the total opposite of what I wanted him too.

I kept at it hoping that it would pick up steam eventually but all I was left with was a simple "Oh, it's over......".  I can not put into words how uninterested I was in this entire game from start to finish! Do not get this game at such a high price. Maybe for 5 bucks but that is it. I'm hoping Loren the Amazon princess 2 will be better but we just have to wait.","May 16","false","12.8"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","0"

It's that the game really fails to balance the amount of talking you do before you can get into ONE actual battle. I easily spend more time reading the game than playing.\n\nThe battle system isn't the greatest thing out there but it works well within the game. Also it can be very quick. So, if you are the grindy type (like I am), grinding can be made very easily and quickly.\n\nAlso, while the artwork is very pretty, it falls misarably into those cliches of big-boobed female with very skimpy and unpratical outfits.\n(because it totally makes sense going into a battle leaving your torso completely open and, apparently, wearing no underwear)\n\nIf this was a $5 game I'd be fine, but it isn't.

There's a heavy focus on reading text to understand/follow what is happening in the story.  Combat is turn-based similar to tabletop card games like "Pixel Tactics" in that you can assign party members to the front or rear row.  Each combatant is qued up on a timeline somewhat like "Dead State" and "Omerta: City of Gangsters".

Mixes up the visual novel storytelling experience with oldschool style RPG battles (think "Legends of Grimrock" for another modern example of this type of battle strategizing), and this really helps keep interest and attention as you progress through the plot. As you work out the skilltrees in the first few hours, the game is already all but begging for a second playthrough in which you'll actually know how to pair the skills well. Normal difficulty sent a few curveballs at me, so I expect Hard will be quite a challenge. My wish for improvement is probably in the game's equipment offerings. The variety in shop inventories feels sparse considering the number of equip slots each character has and the wide-ranging party you're meant to outfit and maintain, and anyway the paltry amount of gold on hand without continuous grinding seems only enough to buy a couple items.","April 1","true","10.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While I was able to play on my tablet, I would stop short of calling this game completely ‚Äútouch-friendly.‚Äù It does use certain mechanics, such as ‚Äúhover‚Äù to see info about items and spells, that are not native to a touch device.  While the information is still accessible, without ‚Äúhover‚Äù the process is cumbersome and often frustrating.  Luckily, installing a virtual mouse/touchpad took care of this problem and I could access everything in the game with ease, as though I was using a real mouse.\n\nLoren the Amazon Princess is, in large part, a virtual novel and the strongest selling point is easily the story.  In fact, I feel it is on par with several AAA franchises, such as Dragon Age and the Elder Scrolls.  The characters possess a lot of personality and I feel I really got to know them through the game's dialog and narrative.  While the game takes place in a modest open world and there are a few side quests, it is never so overwhelming that you lose track of the main story and your ultimate goal.  By the final chapter, I felt my decisions had weight and the lives of my party depended on me making the correct decisions.\n\nThis game isn't all story, however, and the combat is well done.  It is turn based and conducted on a static grid, with opposing parties each having up to three characters in the front row and three in the back.  While the setup is simple, there are enough skills, spells and items to keep the combat dynamic.  I played on ‚ÄúNormal‚Äù difficulty and I found most battles challenging enough that I couldn't just tap-tap-tap through to be victorious.  Strategic planning, resource management and a proper roster were key to coming out on top.\n\nAll in all, I was pleased to find the game had many pros and almost no cons.  It is worth a play if this is a game type you either already enjoy or desire to try out.","February 10","true","31.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Meaning, if you wanted to romance Loren (the Amazon princess), you don't have to play as the male protagonist to do so. (There are two characters of the romance-able cast that are strictly heterosexual and two characters that are strictly homosexual, however, which makes it impossible to gain every possible ending with only one of the playable characters. But hey, more replay value, I guess.) I especially like that a character being bisexual isn't treated as a huge deal. Just a general "oh, hey, you're into both genders". I wish more games (and real life) were as accepting.\n\n*A heads up to people who buy this game though: The game is a pretty solid mix between RPG and dating sim, though it is significantly easier to avoid the romance side of it than say, the Persona games. Vice versa, if you are more interested in the romance elements than the actual RPG gameplay, once you complete one playthrough, you unlock Cheat Mode, which lets you skip battles- should you want to get to a different ending faster.\n\nTL;DR, here's a pro/con list:\n\nPros:\n+The art (whoa, equal opportunity fanservice, what a concept!) More available if you download the Uncensored version...\n+Male/Female protag options\n+Lots of romance options, because of predominantly bisexual cast\n+RPG elements pretty solid: lots of customization, skill trees, a decent amount of armor and weapons to choose from\n+You can save pretty much anywhere in the game if you press Esc.\n+Lots of save files\n\nCons:\n-There's a pretty big spike in difficulty towards the end of the game *coughfinalbattlecough*\n-No CGs or animations\n-Romancing people is pretty...easy. There's literally an option that says "Romance". Though, I will admit, some of the funniest parts of the game are romancing characters that *aren't* people you can end the game with.\n-When your character interacts with someone, you have to choose between "Joking", "Friendly" or "Forceful" instead of picking the actual thing you wanna say. Often times, Forceful makes you sound like an insensitive ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and Joking an insufferable ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, leaving me with Friendly as the only viable option 9 times out of 10.\n\nI'm not saying anything about the price of the game. It may be a little pricey, but the game isn't *that* short, especially if you play on Hard. I also like supporting independent developers. If it's on sale though, and you're teetering on the fence, just go for it.","January 6","true","41.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While I was able to play on my tablet, I would stop short of calling this game completely ‚Äútouch-friendly.‚Äù It does use certain mechanics, such as ‚Äúhover‚Äù to see info about items and spells, that are not native to a touch device.  While the information is still accessible, without ‚Äúhover‚Äù the process is cumbersome and often frustrating.  Luckily, installing a virtual mouse/touchpad took care of this problem and I could access everything in the game with ease, as though I was using a real mouse.\n\nLoren the Amazon Princess is, in large part, a virtual novel and the strongest selling point is easily the story.  In fact, I feel it is on par with several AAA franchises, such as Dragon Age and the Elder Scrolls.  The characters possess a lot of personality and I feel I really got to know them through the game's dialog and narrative.  While the game takes place in a modest open world and there are a few side quests, it is never so overwhelming that you lose track of the main story and your ultimate goal.  By the final chapter, I felt my decisions had weight and the lives of my party depended on me making the correct decisions.\n\nThis game isn't all story, however, and the combat is well done.  It is turn based and conducted on a static grid, with opposing parties each having up to three characters in the front row and three in the back.  While the setup is simple, there are enough skills, spells and items to keep the combat dynamic.  I played on ‚ÄúNormal‚Äù difficulty and I found most battles challenging enough that I couldn't just tap-tap-tap through to be victorious.  Strategic planning, resource management and a proper roster were key to coming out on top.\n\nAll in all, I was pleased to find the game had many pros and almost no cons.  It is worth a play if this is a game type you either already enjoy or desire to try out.","February 10","true","31.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Mixes up the visual novel storytelling experience with oldschool style RPG battles (think "Legends of Grimrock" for another modern example of this type of battle strategizing), and this really helps keep interest and attention as you progress through the plot. As you work out the skilltrees in the first few hours, the game is already all but begging for a second playthrough in which you'll actually know how to pair the skills well. Normal difficulty sent a few curveballs at me, so I expect Hard will be quite a challenge. My wish for improvement is probably in the game's equipment offerings. The variety in shop inventories feels sparse considering the number of equip slots each character has and the wide-ranging party you're meant to outfit and maintain, and anyway the paltry amount of gold on hand without continuous grinding seems only enough to buy a couple items.","April 1","true","10.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you enjoy any kind of tabletop RPG, especially the medieval fantasy ones, you'll love Loren's gameplot: there'll be a great variety of well-described Elves, Orcs, Amazons, Witches, Wizards, Necromancers, Slaves, Dwarves, Dryads and many other typical characters from classic RPG present in Loren.\n\nThe turn-based RPG mechanic of the game is simple and grants lots of fun. A full playthrough has about 10 hours if you aren't a slow reader or thorough RPG player. Sadly for me, as the game progressed, I feel a bit tired of the repetitiveness of the battles and decided to drop the game. Also, the romance mechanic feels a bit disconnected (it's more like optional) from the main plot and reinforced my repetitiveness feeling. That was only my personal experience, but I think the game is pretty good and worth your time anyway.","April 20","true","12.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

One day, your queen Karen disappears without a trace. Her daughter, princess Loren, is determined to find Karen and chooses you as a companion on the journey, mainly because you know healing magic. Along the way a diverse group of able talents joins the search party, and a war breaks out threatening the lives of all inhabitants in Aravorn. And this is just the front face of an even greater threat.\n\nLoren the Amazon Princess is mix of a role-playing game and a visual novel. The story is told through dialogues, where the player has some opportunities to add a bit of personality to the character he/she controls. This eventually leads to some romantic opportunities with other characters in the party of heroes. Some violence is of course needed once in a while with turn-based fights of classical type where some loot can be obtained. The loot can be equipped, or sold in shops where some other equipment can be purchased. Finally, the player and all companions level up once in a while so all standard elements in a role-playing game are included.\n\nApart from the tediousness of levelling up and equipping fifteen-ish characters and the annoyingly generic background music, the game is quite enjoyable. Loren the Amazon Princess is neither pretentious nor bland and I am surprised by the large number of hours I have already invested to finally see the end of the story.","April 9","true","24.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/s4tdlover/recommended/257970/","s4tdlover","Rishoune","http://steamcommunity.com/id/s4tdlover/","31 products in account","Really enjoyable RPG/VN, definitely a good buy if you can get it under $10~$15.\n\nThe story itself isn't entirely new, but playing it from the role of the "sidekick" adds a nice change of pace. Plenty of enjoyable story and good laughs to be had. Romance options are overwhelming and each plays to the strengths (and weaknesses) of how each character is written, so it all feels genuine and makes a good read. Very open to all types of romances. The romance aspect seems nicely woven into parts of the game beyond the romance itself, and has plenty of detail to it that caught me off guard. Playa' at your own risk.\n\nThe art style is nice, good detail. Nothing for graphic-junkies, but has a nice nostalgic feel to it. Combat system is easy to pick up and work with. My first completion was on Normal, and the difficulty was very well done. No super difficulty spikes, but boss fights always felt challenging (excluding once where I was decked out in elements the boss was weak to) and later battles often demanded attention. Music was pretty nice, always fit the mood of the game.\n\nChoice system is nicely done. Nothing overly spectacular, but definitely well done. Some choices reached nearly to or fully to end game. Story has a good variety based on your choices and character.\n\nIs it a good game? Abso-freakin-lutely. Is it worth $20? If you've got the money, yes. I'd highly recommend the Deluxe edition  (especially if you don't want to sacrifice anyone)  . If you can get it for $15 or under, you're doing yourself a crime not getting it. Great props and kudos to Winter Wolves, Loren is very well made RPG/Visual Novel hybrid game that I would like to find and see more games like it. I'd also like a direct sequel, but beggars vs choosers.\n\n(Update May 2016): Having done a few more playthroughs, I cannot put enough emphasis the level of detail that was put into the writing. Even triple-A titles rarely, if ever, have such attention and branching in their stories. Each playthrough always feels different, and even the romance/romances you pursue change and alter nearly every scene. Whether you're an achievement hunter or just love good romance stories, Loren The Amazon Princes is beyond worth it. Even full price, this is a purchase worth much more than what you're paying for. Treat yourself by buying this. You'll never regret it.","February 28","true","70.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
