Like, I don't want to disparage the creative effort of several  dudes who have put out infinitely more games than I have and it's not like the game isn't arguably a more satisfying experience than what you can buy in a vending machine for the exact same price. It's just a perfectly fine game that doesn't really motivate you to do anything besides keep walking left and buying shotgun shells.\n\nThere's no point in fighting the enemies (all of which take three times longer to kill than they should), there's no point in exploring the levels, and zero point in using any weapon besides the shotgun. You can collect points, but once you top up on health kits and shells, there's (shockingly) no point in doing that either. Just run to the left for twenty-five minutes and periodically blast your shotgun at the giants that refill all your health. Eventually, you'll reach the last boss, who eventually explodes in an infinite shower of dumb useless coins like some sort of metaphor for your dumb useless life until you walk into the final Exit door, no better or worse for wear as a human being. Then you find out there isn't actually an exit button and you have to force close the executible, and that's how you end up writing a review as meandering and pointless as this game.\n\nAll that being said, it's a perfectly fine first effort. Better than any of the (zero) games I've actually made! The team very clearly loved what they were doing, as seen in the caring way chunks of viscera bounce along the ground after you commit murder. Plus, you can buy it with the amount of (pointless) steam cards you have clogging up your inventory, and it has at least entertained me as much as the can of Diet Coke I would have bought with those funds anyway. So go for it, I guess. Or don't. Like the intensely apathetic world of Rut Gut, it won't make much of a difference in my life.\n\n","April 21","true","0.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

The simple pixellated and upbeat soundtrack were amazing and super atmospheric.

I use the task manager.\n-When there are two crates one over another and you shot the bottom crate the other stays floating in the air. If the crates could fall...\n-There are not 'Options'. If you can change the controls, volume, etc. the game should become very greater.","May 20","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's no proper exit button, and no controller support.","June 5","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
