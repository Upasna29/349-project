In conclusion, this game is not worth the price tag","January 12","false","0.2"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","26","30","3","2"

Also it appears that the game developers aren't fluent English speakers since there are a lot of mistranslations.","January 11","false","2.2"," 21 of 28 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","21","28","3","0"

Saw a comment by the devs about how this is actually a cutscene and we need to do actions during the cutscene. After several attempts, I managed to work out what was intended - fill the meter by clicking top emp button, keep clicking bottom emp button and hope it works (doesn't always) then keep clicking machine gun button and hope it works. This then brings you into the game.\n\nI died before my first obstable by pushing left and crashing into a wall. I had an option to place my highscore, the flashing icon didn't match the text box. I begun again and pushed escape to see if there were any options, this caused the game to freeze and I was forced to close the game. Many spelling mistakes too.\n\nAn endless runner in which you need to perform an overly complicated, poorly explained and ultimately unecessary opening cutscene and in which you can die by crashing into the surroundings of the screen in addition to obstacles in front of you? I've given up trying before reaching my first obstacle.\n\nNot worth playing until some serious fixes are made.\n","January 19","false","7.6"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","10","11","2","1"

In my opinion keys should be explained somewhat by the " drive " plane.\n\n\nI would say to try it ...","February 29","true","4.2"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

First my problem was a cutscene. I didn't immediately understand what need to do, no tutorial and etc. :( Tried to move ship using keyboard - not work, tried to fire - not work too. I always crash in some power ball. Then, after many attempts, I saw panel with buttons and using method of selection, I find out how complete this cutscene. Now second problem for me - its actual gameplay. I can just pass a few barriers and then I crash. You need always fly fast, because you receive point for speed. So I will not dislike game only through the fact that I'm not so skilled player. Keep in mind, The Great Escape - hardcore game!","March 13","true","2.0"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","1"
