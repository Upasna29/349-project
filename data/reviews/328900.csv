Tough learning curve with an insane attention to historical detail.\n\nI do not know how I missed this game all of these years.\n\n\n","November 7, 2014","true","0.9"," 93 of 95 people (98%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","98","93","95","0","0"

I found it difficult to be attached to them when they're in the hospital all the time.","November 10, 2014","true","0.6"," 44 of 50 people (88%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","88","44","50","5","0"

It resembles Silent Hunter Sub sim with crew managment although if you wish it can also be a hard-core B-17 simulator, down to starting up each individual engine ( the flight physics aren't the most detailed).\nOne problem is that the controls aren''t the least bit intuitive. Imagine trying to start up a B-17 without even having been into one before.\nBottom line, I highly recomend this game to anyone that loves Silent Hunter, B-17's or flight sim fans as this will provide for hours of fun.","March 28, 2015","true","1.6"," 33 of 33 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","33","33","0","0"

Controls are hard but guys if you buy the game, you must either be a die hard 8th AF guy or like realism.

A Joystick is vital to fly the plane, is practically impossible to fly with keyboard.\nIt tends to be repetitive after a couple of missions.\n\nI recommend this only if you are really into flight simulators.","April 23, 2015","true","0.4"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"
