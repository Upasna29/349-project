Here in this little piece of art you'll find so many references to other games and game modes, I haven't expected this at all when I first saw the screenshots. Don't let the graphics scare yourself off, they are part of the game at the beginning and might let you feel like you're back in the nineties.\n\nThe concept is very unique; a bit RPG here, some retro arcade games there, all the references and that filled with funny dialogues and from time to time good music. While you're hooping from one gameworld to another the graphic improves while everything else will stay the same: Shooting and smashing yourself through a horde of different enemies with all the weapons you're able to find in the previous worlds and try to find a way out of the missery your character is in.\n\nThe ending though really strained my nerves. The game begun to stutter caused from many enemies that spawned, often resulted in a gamecrash. It's still in the early access so I hope this will get some improvements.\n\nI really enjoyed the game and felt often reminded to the games I played back in the days. It took me around 5.6 hours to beat the game 100% but it was absolutly worth my time.\n\nGet it while it's in a sale or in a bundle and you won't regret anything!\n\nPersonal rating:\n\n7.5/10.0","June 13, 2015","true","5.6"," 57 of 70 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","57","70","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aprofilehere/recommended/261490/","aprofilehere","Gunderson Mallard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aprofilehere/","2359 products in account","Bedlam should be an incredibly cool game that takes players through a thrilling ride of landmark shooters like Quake, or Medal of Honor while exploring the evolution of video game design. Instead Bedlam mostly just shows us what other great games look like while feeling like a fairly bland shooter itself.\n\nThe journey begins when some gamer, known for technical prowess in shooters, realizes that she is in a game. From there, stuff happens and she has to shuffle around to other games. Bedlam tries to explore various video game genre/subgenres but doesn't ever quite commit. The horror game give you some tighter corridors and zombie enemies, but that's similar to the annoying catwalks that fill out the sci-fi inspired shooter levels, and then pretty much every other level just has wide open spaces but with different fillers (tanks in the World War 2 shooter setting, cottages in the fantasy one). Playing through this game is less like actively exploring different games and more like playing a single game with lots of costume changes, which just comes off as weak. Why does a fantasy game feel like Quake-lite, Medal of Honor have no setpieces, and the futuristic shooter have no interesting weapons? Imagine how something as simple as adding a directional damage indicator when jumping into the Medal of Honor section would have been to communicate growth, or adding a regenerating shield in the future settings, mana and light RPG elements in the fantasy setting, and so on, until the player actually feels the difference in settings and genres. Really, the feeling of movement and how resources are managed would have been an easy way to the chart the growth of shooters. It's these little missing details that really would have made the game shine.\n\nNone of the mechanics or level designs ever grow, which is a real shame. All the different weapons you get feel pretty much the same and seem to have no qualities attached to them: the crossbow shoots a bit lower and sometimes one of the shotguns feels like it actually hurts enemies more up close, but enemies aren't too picky on what you kill them with so there is hardly any strategy or risk involved. Bedlam doesn't exclusively stick to shooters: there are some levels inspired by Pacman, fantasy RPGs, Warcraft, classic and horizontal shooters.\n\nWhat probably feels most out of place is the fact that your character is an absolute bullet magnet. Enemies you can hardly see gun you down with pinpoint accuracy so you sometimes just don't have a chance to even see what killed you before you have to reload and hope that you sprint behind cover fast enough to avoid whatever magic bullets are finding you. Due to level design shifting from bland with dull color designs to a nightmarish mess of ramps and platforms full of holes, the AI gets very annoying. However, towards the end of the game, the quasi-platforming steals the show as the most frustrating aspect.\n\nI feel the ending of the game dragged on for a few hours too long. But it probably only felt like that because I was constantly having to reload due to me missing a jump when I just missed it by, who even knows how much, because I cannot see my feet. Platforming without being able to see your feet is like having to race in reverse, or shoot a gun that always fires off-screen. The jump button was also hit or miss on a controller at times. On top of the inaccurate jumping, the game's platforming sections are all designed like a maze with jump pads that are hard to gauge, alternate routes that lead you backwards, platforms full of holes that will drop you sometimes. This is absolutely one of the most annoying combinations I can even imagine. If anything, this should have been the psychological horror section of the game.\n\nThe concept is certainly interesting, but the mechanics house little creativity at best and are near-broken at worst. You are better off just popping in the games that Bedlam seeks to emulate. The concept and ambition are there, but too much of what should make Bedlam unique is left at surface level.","December 18, 2015","false","7.6"," 75 of 99 people (76%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","76","75","99","7","0"

Initially I was uncertain whether it was a good choice considering that it's got $20 price tag, however;\n- It was overall really really fun, it's buggy but some of the bugs made the game even more entertaining\n- BUT the full game isn't actually available yet, you will reach a sign saying after only an hour or two that says 'end of early access, check for updates’ and a dead end\n\nhttp://youtu.be/kfPwOlYgAlc\nhttp://youtu.be/Qeft_KXzh0M\nOkay to start off with you are are in a world with a theme that borrows heavily from Quake II. I loved that game. You get to play as a Strogg. They don't actually call themselves Strogg but I'm just going to refer to them as Strogg. I was very happy to get to be a Strogg =). I decapitated my superior officer with my salute and off I went. Initially combat wasn't so great. You have a blaster but it's nowhere near as cool as the real Quake II blaster. I found it hard to aim, you need to be very precise and I found it hard to fine tune aiming with the mouse in this game. However after playing for sometime I found aiming easier, so I may have just needed time to adjust. I still think your projectiles need to be bigger, especially your rockets. By the way the rocket launcher in this game has an identity crisis, it doesn’t know whether its a rocket launch or a rail gun lol. I soon found myself in a section playing domination i.e. capture all the points against the AI. That part is a bit of a work in progress, I think they could flesh it out quite a bit more. After taking the points I fought a boss in the next area. It was a cool Quake II style cyborg tank.\n_____However I had trouble progressing through this section. At first it just killed me because it was too strong. Then I was unable to confront it again several times because the guard you need to kill to trigger the boss fight just wouldn't die no matter how many limbs I chopped off of him. So I had to reload and start from the end of the last area a few times until it worked. It also took me a while to discover the chaingun you need to defeat the boss.\n_____Combat started to get more fun at this stage, mainly because there were more enemies. Sometimes you have specific objectives but they can be a little buggy or apparently not fully implemented e.g. at one point I was supposed to proceed to a tower and destroy it. However as soon as I made my way to the tower I was given the next objective without having destroying a thing. Gameplay mainly consists of heading to the next area and fighting through the enemies.\n_____Along the way were some sort of alternate dimension instances filled with purple metallic platforms as well. There wasn't much to these areas but they were interesting locations, sort of like a non-organic version of the alternate dimension in the Half-Life series.\n_____There is one bug at the moment which persistently made the game difficult and apparently it is something to do with the gravity levels. I found that when I reloaded after dying the gravity is for some reason extremely high. You are unable to jump, jump pads a rendered useless and for some reason it creates a really big frame rate drop. Until this bug is fixed in a patch the only way I could find to return the game to normal is by restarting it. This doesn't take long to do, just use quicksave so that you don't lose any progress. There is a bright side to this issue, it causes enemies to do cart-wheels when they die =)\nAfter completing the Strogg act you find yourself in a World War II themed area fighting Germans on your way to church. Unfortunately the game ends before you get to your destination. I never actually saw some of the locations and weapons featured in the screenshots on the steam page.\n\nThe game doesn't look too bad. Obviously it is intended to look like older titles. Make sure you choose the right aspect screen ratio in the display menu. For some reason mine was incorrect by default and I spent the first half hour or so unable to see most of my HUD. Also the game looked a lot better after tweaking this.\n_____Did I mention that I really liked being a Strogg? =) You retain this form throughout the game even during the WW2 section, which was cool.\n_____I found several visually entertaining bugs or unintended features. You can pick up dropped enemy weapons with E and launch them out of the map with left click. You can pick up corpses and flail them about around like Ragdolls. Sometimes amputated limbs of enemies will roll continuously without stopping. I sliced of a Strogg's head and it rolled all the way across a large room bounced off the wall and kept on rolling. Usually the AI is good at aggressively finding you and hunting you down but sometimes enemies spin around continuously or walk around and around in tight circles. If you shoot enemies with the crossbow it takes them to the ground in a low arc and pins them there instead of carrying them at high speed to the surface behind them. Some of the stuff I saw I think should be left as it is =)\n_____The dialogue wasn't always amazing sometimes it was amusing. I found it a bit painful to hear feigned American accents however, especially when I had to repeat that scene multiple times. Some of the sound effects sound like they are straight out of familiar old titles, which was pretty good for nostalgic reasons.\n\nSo yeah I did enjoy enjoy playing this. But I do think $20 is a bit much for what you are getting at least at the moment. I was expecting a full albeit buggy game. Yes I would have preferred not to have been set back so much to buy this game. But I'm not too worried about it personally. However I'm pretty sure it's guaranteed that a lot of people would not be happy to pay $20 for what they would get get in this case.","August 8, 2014","true","19.4"," 58 of 76 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","58","76","0","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashesnbones/recommended/261490/","ashesnbones","Ashes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashesnbones/","2571 products in account","The short: While the core ideas are great, the uninteresting and uninspired environments, terrible gunplay which never improves, ridiculously accurate and frustrating omniscient AI, and lousy jumping puzzles in a game that is incompetent at platforming, all add up to a tedious and frustrating game experience.\n\nThe long:\n\nI really, really wanted to like this game.  The idea of going on a journey through the history of gaming within a game is great and one of the reasons I loved the first 3/4 of Evoland, before it became victim itself to the genre characteristics it strove to make fun of (RPGs).  This romp-through-gaming-history is what also drew me to Bedlam.  Here however, the genres being mocked are early FPS games, which I thought for certain had to be less tedious than the latter parts of Evoland when it reduced down to a grindy RPG.  However, the great premise, witty humor and writing in the early parts of the game, and even the Scottish female protagonist could not save Bedlam devolving into yet another exercise in tedium.\n\nThe graphics and gunplay in the early part of the game is very basic, but the humor of the situation and the voice exchanges between the protagonist and other game characters were enough to keep me amused and interested to see where things would go.  However, after trudging through the levels of this first 'FPS universe', it quickly became apparent that I would have to struggle through the tedious combat and uninspired game environments for longer than I would have liked.\n\nThe second game world that is explored in Bedlam seems even less interesting than the first. Lots of buildings and streets full of nothing but empty cloned rooms and textures.  The only thing really occupying this world is the AI opponents - which themselves are also boring and repetitive.\n\nSpeaking of AI, let me just say this.  At all times, as long as you are within a certain radius of the enemies, they will know exactly where you are, even if that happens to be up 3 flights of stairs or behind cover.  They are also incredible marksmen and will never miss a target if it stands still for even a split second.  This grew annoying very quickly, and while I kept hope that this game logic was just a way to mock early AI systems, nothing in Bedlam's core game behavior ever changed.  Things actually get progressively worse as the enemies gain access to better weapons.\n\nOh and about those weapons!  Alright, don't let anyone tell you there is no such thing as having too many weapons.  This game proves that, beyond a doubt, you should not have access to every weapon you've come across at any point in time.  Not only is it terribly difficult to choose a weapon in later stages of Bedlam due to the overwhelming number you have (especially using a mouse wheel), it is also terribly confusing as to which weapons are more or less powerful than one another.  The developers could have easily remedied this situation by restricting access to weapons that are available on any given game 'universe', or at least removing ones that are similar in power to one another.\n\nAnd now back to the game universes..  I wish I could say that the game worlds that Bedlam visits improve in design, or that the FPS gameplay itself improves, but that would be a lie.  Okay, the one 'low gravity' Unreal-Tournament-inspired level was a bit of fun to play, and actually quite hilarious as the voices of angry teens mocked or reacted to my actions. I'd also give props to the 3D PacMan-inspired level if it was actually any fun to play, but it and the Space Invaders level just feel like early unfinished prototypes that were shoehorned in and wind up feeling just like filler.  Luckily those two non-canon (FPS-wise) levels are over rather quickly.\n\nThe game world that annoyed me the most would probably have to be the 'void' that lay outside of all the game universes you visit.  Its this weird fractured landscape that introduces platform jumping puzzles, and really shines a light on just how bad such a thing is inside an FPS game.  Sure, there are probably one or two first person games that do this relatively well, but they are the exceptions to a rule.  However, Bedlam goes one step further here by introducing a delay between the button-press and the actual jump.  Yes, the character actually takes one extra step before jumping, which meant a lot of falling off obstacles to my death. It wouldn't be so bad if this was done only once or twice in the game, or it didn't reset to the beginning of the level, but unfortunately this mechanic is used and reused and becomes a major problem especially on the final levels.  Learn to save often if you find yourself braving these areas of the game!\n\nAlas, there's not much saving grace for Bedlam.  It has a fun concept. It has good writing and humor in early parts of the game. It has a fairly decent voice actress. And it has one fun level. That's it. Terrible gunplay, AI, level design, and yes jumping puzzles all hamper the experience and make it an overly tedious and frustrating game to play. I'd suggest saving your money or buying this at a discount.","October 13, 2015","false","12.8"," 63 of 90 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","63","90","2","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/261490/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2973 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nBedlam is an original and fun take on the old school first person (multiplayer) shooters from the 90’s (and even before the 90’s). If you enjoyed playing Quake or Unreal Tournament back in the days (you might even play them to this day) then Bedlam is everything you want and more. No need to look any further. Here’s why:\n\nSince this is an Early Access game – and therefore still incomplete – I can’t tell if the final product will be worth your money and time but the first few chapters that I’ve played so far are very entertaining to say the least. I won’t go as far as to say it’s brilliant, but I can’t remember a game that has tried this sort of story before. Not like this, anyway.\nThe basic story is as follows: your character is a scientist who’s volunteering to test some new brain scanning tech. The scan it makes eventually puts you inside a game, but you quickly realize that you can’t get out of it so the scientist is now experiencing the game herself. That’s correct; you are a female gamer, and a Scottish one at that.\nThe story is fairly to-the-point, so you’ll receive mission objectives and you carry them out. The girl will narrate as well, but this is mostly done for comic relief and a bit of a backstory.\nNormally I’d write a whole paragraph about the gameplay, but the game plays like most first person shooters. So there’s a whole lot of shooting involved while completing different objectives. These objectives range from capturing checkpoints, blowing up towers, just plainly killing enemies and even winning an Unreal Tournament inspired low-gravity deathmatch. All made as a nice tribute to some of the older, but still great, games most of us used to play when they were young.\nI haven’t yet played any of them, but there also seem to be a few levels that are a bit different as far as the gameplay is concerned; one of them seems to be a sidescrolling shooter (yup, it’s still all about shooting things). I think it’s a good idea to mix things up a little because not everyone might appreciate and enjoy this sort of repetitive gameplay nowadays. People keep looking for new things and ways to excite them and giving them an old school shooter might not just be the best solution/idea here. But there’s always an audience for things, no matter how silly, so I’m sure it will do just fine.\nBedlam is a game that references a lot of older games but it doesn’t seem to introduce anything truly new to the genre. Don’t get me wrong, because that isn’t really necessary in any way, of course; the game stands outs because of its fun voice-overs and over-the-top action, while it will also let you think back of the times when things were simpler. The Unreal Tournament-like level especially triggered some memories for me. Great times, and I’m certain there are a lot more people who will agree with me here, not just for that level.\n\nThe graphics can also be seen as a tribute with some old-school ugliness in there, especially in the earlier levels, but it gets increasingly better as you progress. It never becomes perfect or beautiful, but it’s all very serviceable nevertheless. Despite its (intentionally) ugly models and environments it all looks very sharp and clean. The developers have done a great job here, even if my review let you think that I maybe didn’t appreciate any of it.\nThe voice acting is charming but the Scottish accent can get a bit tiresome sometimes (no offense to Scottish people ;)). Sometimes it feels like she’s trying a bit too hard but overall I’m very satisfied with how it’s done. The rest of the cast also does a great job here.\nIn short; nothing wrong with the audio-visual experience here.\n\nBecause the game isn’t complete or even out yet, and levels are still being added, I can’t really tell you how long a playthrough will last you. I finished half of the levels in about an hour so I’d say that you can complete this Early Access version in 2,5 hours or so. I’m not sure about this, but I think the final product will last somewhere around 5 hours, maybe even longer.\n\nBedlam is all about bringing you a new old-school experience, and with success. It references a lot of the older shooters from the 90’s while adding some humorous voice acting and levels to complete the package. It might not do anything truly new but if you’re one of those people who doesn’t care about that sort of stuff then you should absolutely play this game. It’s a nice trip down memory lane, no matter what.\n\n[Rating: 77/100]","October 29, 2014","true","3.2"," 29 of 36 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","29","36","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/261490/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3342 products in account","The player assumes the role of Athena, a normal everyday woman who has somehow woken up inside a virtual world of a video game. She makes plenty of self-aware quips throughout Bedlam, ranging from obvious and cringy to downright hysterical. She quickly realizes she's in a shooter from the '90s, and it's not long until she manages to escape through a glitch in the game to be transporting to various other worlds.\n\nBedlam will take players through different time periods and genres of video games, but does eventually become too formulaic. Players will enter a world, complete its objectives, enter an "in between" glitch world, and then move on to the next section. While not predictable in the sense that the new world will be a surprise, the concept becomes rigid and boring.\n\nThere is an underlying story besides "look at the funny parody worlds," and unfolds through in-game radio chatter and hidden sections within each world. It's all based on the book by the same name, which I haven't read, but seems to deal with essentially the same thing. In a way, Bedlam felt like a long winded way of saying "hey, you should read the book." The story is somewhat engaging and certainly well written, but the lack of closure at the end of the game was a huge letdown.\n\nBedlam handles like a first-person shooter, with one or two exceptions, and does a great job of nailing down the shooting mechanics. Each world has a unique set of weapons to acquire, but ammo for each gun is limited to its respective world. This sounds like an interesting mechanic on paper, but in reality the player gets so many guns that ammo is never an issue due to the wide breadth of options.\n\nIn fact, and I didn't think I'd ever say this, but there are likely too many weapons. They all have their small quirks and differences, but all of the shotguns, machine guns, and pistols might as well be identical. The large number of options also makes it a pain to switch between weapons, especially when using the mousewheel. Every number on the keyboard is assigned to a weapon, and it never really felt worth it to memorize what was where.\n\nThere are also platforming sections that take place during the in between glitch worlds. I'm hesitant to even call them platforming sections since the player is literally jumping over small distances from one long rectangle to the next. They are in no way challenging, but I did die a few times, usually because I had no idea that there was no ground in between certain sections. Most of these sections are only there to keep the player busy while radio chatter occurs to thicken the plot.\n\nPerhaps the best part of Bedlam is the "tour" through various styles of first-person shooter tropes. I won't spoil them all here, but all of the classic FPS environments are present, and some that will definitely take players by surprise and have them laughing. Of course, going back in time does have its design downfalls, as some worlds are more barren than anything else, and there's a few instances of poor mission design that will leave players frustrated and anxious to jump into the next section.\n\nThe last level in particular is especially drab. It falls into the classic pitfall of "throw everything possible at the player and see how they do." Honestly, I used the explosive weapons to rocket-jump through just about all of it. Perhaps that was intended, but considering how wonky rocket-jumping physics are in Bedlam, I highly doubt it.\n\nEach world ends with a boss, and they're all impressively mediocre. The big thing shows up, player shoots it a lot. The last boss in particular is tedious, and offers up just about zero challenge to the player. Despite the poor boss fights, the game has enough brilliant small moments to really stand out. After I had completed the game, the things that stuck with me were the tiny segments that used its plot device to its strength and didn't adhere to the obvious formula that it was playing with. I'm confident in saying that there are enough of these to keep the player interested throughout most of the game.\n\nTo accompany the decade-hopping mechanics, the game's aesthetic varies from place to place as well. Most noticeably, the models get progressively better as the meta-titles get more modern. However, things like the health and body armor pickups remain the same throughout every world. It would have been interesting to see the developer also explore how health system evolved as the genre itself did, but instead we get floating health packs that are way out of place in most of the worlds.\n\nThe voice acting, at least, is top notch. The radio chatter is entertaining and very well done, it's just a shame that a handful of times I was forced to read the subtitles because the surrounding noises, like being in a firefight, drowned out the actual voice acting.\n\nBedlam will take players on a jaunt through various first-person shooter worlds, but the problem is that none of them are particularly great. There are some absolutely wonderful and memorable moments strewn throughout the experience, but they are brought down by some poor design in both the missions and boss fights, and essentially the entire last chapter. I genuinely did have some great laughs, and there are worse ways to kill an afternoon, but ironically Bedlam falls prey to many of the same issues of the games it apes.","February 22","true","41.8"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","21","23","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/recommended/261490/","zorder","Zorder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/","1994 products in account","Bedlam was a blast to play. In a time and age where most FPS are designed to appeal to the masses, few titles evoke the sense I had when I first played DOOM or Quake, unless we’re talking about the recent Wolfenstein game. That said, I’m not saying this is comparable with those games in terms of quality and overall production values, but I do strongly believe that this is an underrated gem and so I’d like to express how this game deserves to be played.\n\nIn Bedlam you play as Heather Quinn, or Athena (her nickname). You’ve recently got a new job and soon enough you find yourself trapped inside some sort of videogame. Soon enough you realize the sort of mess you’ve put yourself into and uncover a conspiracy that is placing your digital life in danger. This is what I really enjoy about Bedlam. The game takes place inside various game worlds and is brimming with tons of references that trigger so many memories and filled me with nostalgia so many times.\n\nThroughout the game you’ll play on various different settings, from alien worlds that reminded me of Quake, to medieval villages and a war torn Europe. Each of these sections will give you access to a whole new range of weapons that fit this timeline. This is also one of old school aspects of Bedlam that I really appreciate. The fact that you can have up TONS of weapons and switch between them as you see fit, instead of being restricted to 2 or 3 weapons like in most FPS these days. Weapons range from blasters, a crossbow, a minigun, a railgun, a sniper rifle, you name it, there is something for everyone. Of course, each of these settings will also present you to a new aesthetic and new types of enemies. Therefore, the game manages to keep the levels interesting and fresh by not only changing the graphical style but also the way the levels themselves are designed.\n\nAs you could expect, this is an homage and a love letter to the times when the FPS genre was at its height. In that sense, the game is extremely fast paced, there is no walking, you’re constantly on the move, and you need to be so, in order to not be hit by enemies. The fact that you move so fast and have access to such a huge arsenal made the game a lot of fun for me to play, since different weapons would be more suitable to defeat certain enemies.\n\nThere is only two complaints that I’d like to mention, the fact that sometimes the enemies would get stuck behind walls and other times they’d shoot behind those walls (still hitting me), and the other complaint is related to the hitboxes of props, sometimes I’d shoot over an object while having my crosshair directly on the enemy but the shot would hit the object in front of me. Besides that, it’s worth mentioning that the game is also somewhat short. It can easily be beaten in 5-6 hours (atleast on medium difficulty).\n\nTo finalize, Bedlam was an extremely pleasant surprise. I had it sitting on my library for ages and I’m very glad I went ahead and gave it a go. The soundtrack is mindblowing good and I’m actually sad I can’t find it outside the game. If you’re a fan of first person shooters, especially if you’re a fan of games like DOOM, Quake and Wolfenstein, Bedlam might be worth check out. It is fun, varied, charming, challenging, nostalgic, filled with gaming and geeky references and features a rather interesting and unique storyline.

Oh, and there's a plot about being stuck in a video game world that's being destroyed by glitches and stuff, but whatever.\n\nThe biggest problem with this is that although the art styles are really fun to see in how they differ, the gameplay remains exactly the same throughout. It almost never varies no matter which game you're in, whether it be the Quake 2 knock-off, the WW2 Call of Duty knock-off, the Left 4 Dead knock-off, the Planetside knock-off, the Fantasy MMO knock-off, the Civilization knock-off or the Unreal Tournament knock-off. It's almost entirely consistant throughout, and it's a HUGE missed opportunity. There are a few levels which deviate from this (knock-offs of Pac-Man, Space Invaders and... uh, a generic Shmup), but they're short and barely have time to register before you're back into standard shooting.\n\n...oh, did you notice I mentioned knock-offs? Yeah, you're playing through games 'inspired' by classic games of the genre. This wouldn't be an issue if all the other characters you talk to over the radio didn't mention games that actually exist. They're off playing through Rayman, GTA and Lego Batman, while you're stuck in... generic fantasy land. The references just make you feel like you're missing out on what could have been.\n\n"What could have been" is a perfect phrase for this game, to be honest. It's full of missed opportuties that would have made things infinitely more enjoyable. Being able to use guns from one game in another is neat, but there's no ammo for them so you just won't bother. The AI is consistantly frustrating - they're always amazingly accurate with their guns and as a result you'll constantly get shot before you even know they're there. The sections in between levels are just sort of broken platforms in space which feature some VERY questionable platforming (don't jump on the tiny platforms, you'll fall right through them). And every single section is generic, repetitive and drags on for far too long.\n\nIf there are positives to be had, then it's in the visdual department. The game LOOKS perfect. Every single style of game is fantastically put together and when they do bleed together it usually looks pretty neat. The audio, on the other hand, is much more mixed. The lead voice actress is pretty good (and Scottish, which is a pleasant change), as is the the titular Bedlam, and the villains are suitably menacing. The other characters... not so much. Their acting leaves something to be desired and never really works, so you're pulled out of every conversation they have.\n\nI tired of this game remarkably quickly and by the end I was practically on my knees BEGGING for it to be over. The game has a neat concept but the poor execution and overlong levels means it vastly outstays its welcome. And the absolute kicker is that the game ends on a sodding "Hey, here's a portal, let's see where it leads" cliffhanger. Because, y'know, I wanna play MORE of this.\n\nMaybe if the developers actually tighten the floaty controls and make the different games FEEL different, I could recommend this. As it is though... I really can't.\n\nOh, and screw the snipers who turn invisible. ♥♥♥♥♥♥.","October 21, 2015","false","6.3"," 30 of 41 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","30","41","0","0"

I am a huuuuge fan of Christopher Brookmyre and Bedlam is a really great book, especially if you are into gaming. It's pretty obvious in his books that Brookmyre must have spent several hours in front of a computer screen, playing FPS games.\n( off topic: I'd recommend reading "a big boy did it and ran away"; "pandaemonium" and of course "bedlam" for the gaming references, however all his books are great, witty, gory and so on. One note however, he publishes books under the name Chris Brookmyre: those are really suspensful thrillers, the Christopher Brookmyre books are basically the equivalent to a Quentin Tarantino movie.... just my two cents and end of off topic )\n\nSo I have wanted to get my hands on this games since the moment I heard about it. Now, to be precise, it is still "early access" however the content is very promising so far, and I really love it, there will be more levels in the future.....\n\nI'd like to explain why I really like it. Don't get me wrong here, there are many, many games with better graphics, many with a better gameplay, I'd even say that this is not one of "my top ten games of 2014" IF I only consider the actual "playing" of the game. However, the actual experience playing this game is just fantastic. As somebody who played Quake back in when it was the number one game to play, this one just feels right. It's so full of all the gaming nonsense that was once topnotch in gaming.\nIf you have read the book, the reference to the story are there and obvious and funny, however there is no need to buy the book, if you are just interested in spending some time laughing to yourself and thinking back to the times when you reached secrets by just walking into a wall, or when all the bad guys looked the same, or when the dialogue were full of pathos and kitsch, or.... well whatever...\n\nThe game is full of references to older games, without making of these games, rather making fun with the games.... and Athena kicks ♥♥♥!\n\nThis is the first time I bought an early access game, and I would do it again.... Right now!\nDevelopers when you read this, please turn Pandaemonium into a game.... "a field trip meeting a DOOM scenario..!"

Utterly utterly insane.\n\nI cannot recommend this game enough. It's one of those games you have to play, just to experience it.\n\nI put nearly five hours into this game, and finished the early access in one sitting. I'm genuinely disappointed there's not more to play yet.\n\nThe storyline is... confusing, but I gather that it's supposed to be. I want to see where it goes. I am committed to this wild ride.\n\nThe game is pretty self-aware, ticking off tropes like there's an achievement for including them all, and manages to balance the vast array of weapons from genre to genre and era to era well too.\n\nHowever, the game is not without its faults too.\n\nIn the obligatory sewer level, there is a conversation with an NPC that triggers at a certain point. I was mobbed by zombies and died before the end of the conversation, and reloaded. This time, the conversation didn't trigger, and I spent a full 45 minutes in the sewer, attempting to find an exit that apparently only appears after the conversation has finished.\n\nIn the WW2 level, the enemy soldiers will sometimes run around in circles when you shoot them. I'm not sure if this is satirising dodgy AI, or is actually dodgy AI.\n\nOverall, none of the problems are deal-breakers; and the game itself is full of dark, quirky humour, interesting concepts, and fast-paced, fun gameplay.\n\nWorth every penny.","October 11, 2014","true","13.4"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","19","25","0","1"

Just think it as FPS version of wreck it ralph. The plot of this game is interesting, if you are playing it and think it's boring, just keep playing for few hours and you'll learn what happened to the characters\n\nthanks to this game I knew that main character is Scottish. and I learn something about it. I thought it was Russian, middle east or anywhere else. I think I never heard that accent before. As a guy from non-english speaking country that love to learn culture, I found the accent was "unique" as I lost some words but subtitle does help.\n\nThis game is still early access, and I found there are many glitch also the difficulty is steep.. at first the game is very easy, but the last is very hard, well not really that hard like people says-- it'll be very easy if you are taking glitches as advantages\n\nI think I'm somewhere near the end of the game and I recommend this game if you are a looking for a non-mainstream FPS game that has good story telling. editted : and you are aware this is EARLY ACCESS\n\nEditted 6/15/15 :\nthe core level, is still very buggy..\nthe developer removed FPS text on top left\nI think they are working on several issue as they keep updating the game every week but still I can't finish the beat the core level..

You play as a woman who gets trapped in a video game and as she tries to escape back to the real world, she ends up jumping from one video game to another.\n\nThe writing, humor, story, and voice acting are all fantastic. However, to experience all of that you also have to experience average gunplay, awful level design, a lot of bugs, cheap enemy AI that uses aimbots, among other things. Bedlam is only around 6 hours long with no replay value. And even with its short length, there are several areas of the game that are padded out for no reason.\n\nFor a game that was in Early Access for over a year (let's not forget when Bedlam entered Early Access, it was already 50% finished), this is extremely disappointing.\n\nI did enjoy it because the writing and humor was excellent but I'm not sure most people will be willing to sit through the numerous issues this game has to experience the good.\n\nFull video review:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBp6FWup1-k","April 11","true","8.9"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

That's not a parody, that's just making a terrible game.\n\nWhen the game first starts you're placed in what you assume is a parody of a low budget FPS game, like some russian made starseige:tribes.  It tricks you. You're having fun enough, Jumping around fast, shooting dumb enemies with simple weapons.  It's not terrible, and there's a little bit of humor to keep you going.  Then you change worlds to a WW2 game.  This is where the warning sirens went off. It's not like any WW2 FPS game. It's not wolfenstein, it's not call of duty, it certainly isn't medal of honor either.  Instead I'd have to compare it to a super linear city level from BF1942, where you're (almost) forced to clear out  building after copypasted building of nazi snipers. There's about one joke in this level.  The WW2 fps genre has so many things you could be parodying and pointing fun at, hell, where's the d-day invasion where you're charging the beach? Instead, like I mentioned earlier you just go through bland city blocks clearing out buildings so aimbotting snipers (with no tracers)  don't murder you. It wasn't fun. It wasn't challenging. It was just awful.\n\nI couldn't make it much farther because I realized that the game wasn't going to improve. You get more guns, but none of them are interesting at all.   Did the developers actually play quake or UT?  There's no silly UI changes between levels, there's not even a BLOOD ALL OVER WHEN YOU GET SHOT SO REALISTIC joke in there.  Instead inbetween levels occasionally you might find an ancient image macro that you might chuckle at (or most likely want to facepalm).\n\nThere are a few good jokes in the game, and the protoganist is extremely scottish, but it's just such a bad GAME that none of it is worth slogging through.","October 14, 2015","false","1.8"," 43 of 72 people (60%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","60","43","72","4","2"

Take the mantle of the Doom Guy, Commander Shepard or whoever you want? Then, jump between worlds and get to use arsenal from one game in the other?\n\nWell, that's exactly what happens Bedlam!\n...sort of.\n\nAllowing players to enter games like Unreal, World of Warcraft, World of Tanks, Call of Duty or Halo would be a licensing nightmare for developers. Therefore everything had to be replaced by obvious knock-offs, with real video game titles only mentioned in conversations or overheard messages. This is understandable, albeit a bit disappointing. A cool premise just had to be ruined by copyright.\nStill, we can make our own crossovers for free through mods.\n\nThe idea of game jumping seems to be the main schtick of Bedlam. The game is full of winks towards people experienced in gaming, especially those who know a thing or two about history of games (mainly FPS games, to be exact). As mentioned before, the idea already took one blow because of lack of licensed titles but there is more. The entire game screams "wasted opportunities", as the only thing that really grows is the arsenal from different worlds. Aside from three short segments the gameplay does not change significantly. Even though the environment changes, there is no variety to game mechanics to follow this. Such a shame, this would bring in so much nostalgia!\n\nThe one area in which the player might experience sufficient variety is bugs. The most irritating example include the scenery elements and walls which serve to stop you... but none of the enemies or their bullets - this is especially promonent in the last level, in which the game throws hordes of enemies at you. Another annoying problem can be spotted especially when using sniper rifles. You might see the enemy through the scope and aim perfectly, but apparently the game does not always register the hit. This might have something to do with the weapon range or enemy spawn points - who knows.\n\nOk, that's enough of the negativeness. Time to point out the positives.\n\nThe game still can be quite fun if you want some simple run & gun action, especially if you are a sucker for somewhat nostalgic experiences. Aside from that, the story can be interesting (apparently it is tied in with a book under the same name) and then there is the protagonist...\nShe is really great. At first I had a problem with understanding her (really strong accent + my hearing impediment, not a good combination) but that's what subtitles are for. The more time I spend with her the more fond I grew of her, she's a really nice character. Unfortunately, aside from two NPC whom you never get to meet face to face (or rather avatar to avatar) and rarely get to talk with over the comlink, she's the only interesting character in Bedlam.\n\nThe game does not take itself terribly seriously and likes to make fun of the peculiarities of game communities (like annoying, squealing children in online matches!) and games in general. Once you go in, expect some memes as well.\n\nIt's at times like this when I wonder: should there be a "meh" button aside from "recommend" and "don't recommend"?\nLet it sink in. Ponder on it in your subconscious mind. Answer it in your dreams, then promptly forget once you wake up.\n\nTL;DR The game is alright but it has some problems. Go in if you want some game humour and nostalgia. Do not expect incredible variety and exciting surprises.","February 5","true","13.4"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

This is a game that tries to take old styles of FPS gaming to the front and add a modern sensibility, this usually is a complicated affair because the shooting is the easy part, is one of the most elemental forms of interaction in game design, what usually feels off about this kind of endeavours is the movement, the way you move in the game world is bastly different, if you are old enough you can  remember it, and usually there´s a disonance in what you remember and what you feel playing a game that tries to infuse modern movement in retro shooters and it can lead to some dissatisfaction, there´s some of this in Bedlam too, is unavoidable to an extent, but the game succeds in its graphic presentation and you can find your self smiling remembering old exploits.\nThe acting is pretty good, the weapons feel good to shoot for the most part, there´s some rough edges of course, but the game runs pretty well overall, right now you can easily end the game in under three hours, but the devs are pretty active in the forums and they are adding content, they have announced two more worlds, and are polishing the existing ones, i truly enjoyed my time with it and hope to continue doing it with the next additions, so far no regrets with this game, but remember is early access and if you have any caveats with it you may want to wait for the finished version, i for sure plan to keep playing and replaying it","October 9, 2014","true","8.2"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

If you’re not like me however and you stepped into the world with all of this new spangled ultra-realistic graphics on your plate a) you’re very lucky, and b) you’re very unlucky for you haven’t lived.  Granted these days the “Retro” scene is quite big and a lot of people flock to embrace games I’ve discarded eons ago, but you weren’t there man!\n\nIt was my gaming past which attracted me to Bedlam from the very short demo I witnessed, based upon a novel of the same name by cult Scottish author Christopher Brookmyre. This FPS game sees you take on the role of Heather Quinn (aka Athena) a colleague of Ross Baker (aka Bedlam). Heather is an overworked and underpaid scientist developing medical technology for corporate giant Neurosphere. One rainy Monday morning Heather volunteers as a test candidate for the new Neurosphere brain scanning tech – anything to get out of the office for a few hours.  It’s here it all starts going wrong for Heather as she becomes trapped inside Starfire – the Sci-Fi shoot-em up she played as a teenager – with no rhyme or reason for why she’s in her and currently under fire, she picks up a gun and ploughs on in.\n\nWithin seconds of playing this game anybody that played Doom, Quake, Star Wars: Dark Forces, Duke Nuke’em, Castle Wolfenstein and of course Star Trek: Elite Forces (just) will feel right at home.  That’s clearly a lot of names on the chest but it’s proud to show them and further into the game it even manages to sneak in a UT’99 Homage with the Deathmatch map Morpheus (with trolling Teamspeak teenagers too). This is in amongst the many other nods to the decades of gaming through the years you’ll see.  The generation of FPS from the 90’s (and late 80’s) has been perfectly captured with pixellated blood spurts, limbs falling off and the surrounding maps.  It’s clear that the designers had a love for this era and they’ve set out with a goal and they achieved it.\n\nThe missions though basic occasionally can be a bit of a challenge and make you work for you goal; from domination to destroy the towers to your basic run through the map and destroy “X” at the end.  You do need to keep an eye out for the shields and health packs as the enemy’s fire does inflict significant damage; with no health regeneration you can be quite knackered without the two afore-mentioned items.  Occasionally you’ll come across a bizarre moment like the UT’99 homage when I assumed I was finished a mission. You just have to remember this is part of Athena’s Neurosphere brain scan and accept it.  Occasionally Athena starts talking to herself – singing too – which can be amusing and also help push the story forward.\n\nA couple of things however bothered me about the game – one being the basic pistol seems in the opening levels to be the best weapon in the game for range and damage (minor I know), but the biggest issue I have – one that made me rage quit at one point – is the bizarre autosave the game has.  In this case it saved me at one health before a mob so when I restarted the game I was shot straight away and died.

Plus, the protagonist is an extremely well-voiced Scottish woman, not exactly something you are going to encounter often unless you have a fever dream and mix up the characters in No One Lives Forever 2.\n\nGranted, if your tolerance for "jank" is low, you might not want to check it out.  At least, not yet.  I mean, I think this is still in early access?  It sure seems basically finished though?  Who knows?  It also probably drags a bit too much at the end.

The idea is very cool, the writing is decent, and the voice acting is very cute. But there's a problem: making a game about glitchy games is not an excuse to make a glitchy game. And a good concept is wasted with bad execution.\nAs an actual videogame, Bedlam is a pain to play. I have endured it to hear the story, but it was hardly worth it. The levels are vast, half-empty mazes where you get lost with no idea where to go and keep trying different paths just to end up jumping outside the map or getting stuck in the terrain. I would applause if it was an actual game mechanic, but it's not, it's just crappy level design. The enemies are disappointing, and their animation is so bad that the game itself references it (no, it's not an automatical excuse either).\nBedlam is not a good game, but a proof of its makers' talent and creativity. Buy it if you want to support an aspiring indie developer. If you just want to have a good time playing a game, look elsewhere.","July 10, 2015","false","10.4"," 17 of 27 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","17","27","2","0"

Bedlam fails to create the atmosphere of retro shooters or to even properly analyse 90’s FPSs. The experience hides its own flaws behind the guise of being a caricature. Nothing in this game feels modern, and the badly designed levels and gameplay would’ve been considered poor back in the days of Half-Life. The storyline is absolutely structureless, and features one of the worst endings I’ve ever seen in a game. The actors sound bored, the environments feel lazy and there’s very little to bring you back when this ‘homage’ is done. I wouldn’t recommend this game to even hardcore fans of the genre.\n\nThere’s a decent enough setup within the game’s world. In Bedlam you work for a company that has designed a machine that can import personalities into digital environments, including video games. Your faithful employer decides you’d be best suited entering the fictional world of “Starfire,” an early 90’s FPS game from your youth. These points are the full extent of the story. Sure, you’ll pick up some emails throughout the game, explaining your love of the “Starfire” franchise, but it doesn’t contribute in any way. The story might be one of the most offensively simple I’ve seen in the past year.\n\nCharacters are introduced and are either completely thrown away, built up into nothing, or are clearly the villain; one that turns by their second appearance. You jump from one bad gameplay experience to the next, waiting for Bedlam to evolve or add new elements; but it never does. You’ll travel through a collection of retro shooters in an attempt to escape. Its final level is one of the longest and worst paced finales I’ve ever spent two hours slogging through and ends with quite possibly the laziest boss fight I’ve ever played. I don’t want to spoil anything, but it doesn’t attack you, it doesn’t move, and it requires you to bounce on a jump pad over and over in order to get a shot in on it. Then, the game wipes its hands, leaving you without answers or memories of enjoyment in one of the most unsatisfying endings I ever slammed my keyboard over.\n\nI was really looking forward to playing this game too, because at least on paper the premise seems to work. Evoland 2 did a great job of taking a ton of different tropes and elements from entries in it’s genre, and I really enjoyed that experience despite its flaws. This game however just doesn’t bend these aspects into anything engaging, and ends up leaving the experience feeling as dated as it’s subject. Jumping from space stations on an alien planet to a World War 2 shooter sounds like a winner. It gets even more bizarre when you visit some 2D arcade shooters and even an RTS board with a giant hovering mouse cursor above you. It’s all so delightfully self-aware and inventive. The reason it doesn’t work however is because they didn’t throw any new ingredients into the pot, and it leaves the whole experience feeling repetitive and boring.\n\nYou’d think that with so little attention spent on the story, you might actually get some love from the retro gameplay. It was nice to go back to a non-regenerating health bar, but there’s a reason the genre has evolved. Like Duke Nukem Forever, it does nothing to modernize or even make the experience feel smoothed out in anyway. If it was the intention of the designers to recreate the frustration of unintuitive controls, broken assets and game breaking bugs, well congratulations; you nailed it. Having my gun suddenly stop working in a middle of a firefight threw me into a fit I haven’t experience since I was five years old.\n\nThe game does feature a large assortment of guns and weapons that you pick up from various points in the game. This does provide moments of bliss when you take a flame sword and shoot fireballs at miniature tanks, or shoot a rocket at spooky scary skeletons. It’s interesting having such a wide assortment, but sadly not all of the guns have their advantages, and some will get forgotten when you get a better version later in the game. As I mentioned earlier, if the guns work. And even if they do, you’ll find moments where you’ve laid five shots into an enemy’s chest, only for them to vaporize before connecting.\n\nArt design is all over the place. All the elements feel purchased, like a hodgepodge of different styles and intent. The environments are barren, and lacking diversity outside of the same six assets. This is one area where I could almost forgive the lack of polish, as amassing a ton of components for a 10 minute section would be overkill, but the game does a bad job of hiding its small library.\n\nSound design matches the relic-like qualities of everything else. Music is bland and forgettable. The sound effects are average, and aren’t mixed very well. Probably the most grievous oversight however, is that everyone speaks with a heavy accent through fuzzy and digitized filters. It makes sense, given that many of the characters are off-screen in the distant land of “Liberty City” and “Saints Row”, but I can’t make out anything they’re saying over the static. This forced me to read the entirety of the game’s dialogue, and the constant yammering of actors who have no idea what ‘inflection’ means. The performances are simply atrocious.\n\nFor “parody” to work, there has to have a clear target and its own sense of enjoyment. If it doesn’t, your take on the subject will come across as a cash-in over an entertaining effort. Nothing feels like there was any effort put into it; to engage the player with questions about why games like Heretic worked. If you want to side with the idea that these faults were intended, to match the subject- be my guest. Me personally, I see it as convenient as writing a movie set from the visual perspective of a blind person. You can call it clever- I’ll call it a radio drama with a movie’s ticket price.","October 13, 2015","false","6.0"," 27 of 47 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","27","47","2","8"

You might expect being able to play through the classics of FPS - levels that feel like Quake 2, Medal Of Honor, Halo etc. but instead you will find yourself having the same thought in every one of these: "This is so very loudly a slapped-together Unity game window-dressed as Quake 2, Halo etc."\n\nWhat I mean is that the gameplay is never different from "era" to "era". You always move, shoot, jump and everything as if it's a modern day drag and drop my-first-FPS.\n\nAI is abysmal, in that it is both moronic and also has pinpoint accuracy on you. No, the AI does not improve to match the history of gaming as you play.\n\nWeapons are many, but none are satisfying. For a game that relies so heavily on fighting waves upon waves of tedious enemies, the gunplay is ♥♥♥♥.\n\nDon't let the "Space Invaders" and "Pac-Man" screenshots fool you, either. The implementation is utterly laughable. Feel free to look up a gameplay video on youTube.\n\nThe only reason I played this long, and the absolute best part of the game, is the protagonist - your player character. The voice actress is just amazing. Every line she delivers will make you grin. More games should be voiced by foulmouthed Scottish women. Great voice talent all around, and the writing contributes to this too.\n\nShame that the actual "game" part of the game is so horrible.","February 14","false","5.6"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","2"

Combat is just so so but it  kind of reminds me of some of those oldschool games. The control scheme should be improved, particularly because there are too many weapons and you cannot access them all via single keys. Scottish voices are uncommon in videogames but it does sound somewhat refreshing to hear different accents.\n\nI had a difficult time in platform sections, which were frustrating to some extent but I think that it is not that bad if you keep on quick saving.\n\nTo summarize, I would really recommend this game to oldschool gamers who still love old FPS, nostalgia retro gamers in general and anyone who is curious about the evolution of FPS gaming. People who are more used to Halo, CoD or Battlefield may find it slow paced and the AI too simple. But, as a tribute to some good old games it is great.","April 23","true","14.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Crafty storytelling, tounge-in-cheek video game culture humour, and fast paced gameplay all come together to make a real treat of a game. Now, as the game is still in early access, it's not without a few bugs, but nothing too game-breaking.

Normally I would wait to review a game like Bedlam, which is still in early access, until I at least had put more hours in...but because it's on sale as I write this, at an even better price then the Holiday Sale when I got it, I had to relate that I feel this game justified FULL price within the first ten minutes of playtime, and hasn't since let down, at least for me. It is challenging and engaging, and never feels like it copies too much from any of the games it salutes...it even mentions some by name, yet there is a fresh feel that's fun, exciting and there's still more to come...not to mention I also have a lot more yet to experience with what is already here. Best of all is there are areas, apart from following where the game leads you, that take you into what feels like a whole other dimension, and salute different games altogether, then take you back to where you would have been if you hadn't drifted off the main path. This game, Bedlam, is like a gift that keeps on giving, especially for those who have a particular fondness of first-person shooters and the games that defined the realm. Don't let my hours of play (at the time of this review, less than 2) take anything away from the extent to which I so highly recommend Bedlam...especially if you see it on sale...but it is totally worth the full price, even when in early access. Worth noting also, that even when my aged game card can't handle many of the newer releases, Bedlam looks awesome and plays awesome and adds to my recommendation. If you're going back and forth on whether to go for it, I say go full on, and enjoy Bedlam!","January 6, 2015","true","6.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

So there are sequences reminiscent of Quake 2, Day of Defeat, RTS games, even Pac-Man and other arcade games.  All in all it makes for a fun game where the graphics don't matter too much. And the story is forcefully told by your character, who really pushes the accent.  It's tongue in cheek and has way more cursing than it really seems to need, but for the most part it does a good job mixing the worlds and experiences well.  Except the last level, which feels like it's half as long as the rest of the game combined, and really could have been shortened significantly without impacting the game.  But that's a minor quibble - if you enjoy old school FPS games, this is a nice diversion.

I would not spend 15 euros on it though. 3 to 5 euros? Sure, why not.\n\nIt is full of memes, ancient or recent, references to other games (mostly VERY old games), I cracked a smile at every corner. It brought up so many good memories from the old quake times....if you are too young, you will just not feel the same even though you may have played the old games in the past. Having played those games 20 years ago or 2 years ago, it is not the same, that is why you call it 'nostalgia'. Anyway, I have to argument against one of the main downside the other reviewers wrote about:\n\nI may or may not agree with those who said that the game is always the same from the beginning till the end even though it explores many different settings (arcade, FPS, RTS, fantasy RPG). But well, guess what: the game IS an FPS and it is an indie game, most likely low budget, and making it an FPS was a stylistic choice evidently. Re-creating every sort of game would have been not only a very hard work, but also something that would need to suit the game engine capabilities (level up for RPG, gameplay mechanics for RTS etc etc) so I do not criticize the choice of the developers to make the game look and feel like an FPS even when you are travelling through the RTS and fantasy RPG sceneries.\n\nIn a way it was actually fun to blast my way through minitanks with a giant cursor hovering over my head....\n\nJust a quick hint about vsync: the game has a vsync option that really introduces a lot of input lag. If you are not playing with gsync and want to have vsync activated, force adaptive vsync from the nvidia control panel and set 'pre-rendered frames' to '1'. Don't activate the vsync from the game. You will have a working vsync with almost no input lag.

It is tough for me to make a statement on the price as I actaully did an Early Access demo of the game with a complimentary key in February of last year, but I can see where someone might complain about the pricetag.\n\nFirst off, I really like the story for the game. It is well written and perfectly presented in game format,  Full voice acting throughout gives great character to the different entities in the game, further adding to the quality of the storytelling. Cutscenes are fairly minimal, and most of the dialog goes on during active gameplay. Its about 5 hours of story, so call it 2-3 movies but its also interactive.\n\nThe art is great. Very nice representation of a variety of game types, and the mixture of all the weapons from each genre and era makes for very entertaining combat options. Fighting enemies of different genres and poly counts is also quite satisfying. Audio equally matches the visual fidelity, and the rocket arena is a helluva laugh!\n\nGameplay is quite fun. Playing through the different genre/quality combinations with a fairly reasonable representation of each one helps make sure gameplay matches the story for the area. There's definitely a lot of places where I felt much safer using quick save and quick load to guarantee success, and certainly a few places where the stealth sniper jerks get pretty annoying.\n\nThe one thing that kinda stings the price to value perception is the soundtrack not being available. That, and if you were expecting 20 hours of content, might be disappointed, but this is 100% quality with no filler and minimal things which take the player out of gameplay.\n\nOh and I couldn't use the keyboard for the non-FPS part of the game. It may have been that the gamepad took over for that part, but all I could do was shoot.

These trips through other games is purely aesthetic. With the exception of the side-scrolling 2D shooter they don't emulate the style of the games they're aping. The gameplay feels like a mediocre Quake-like where you're always in these massive sprawling environments that are filled with a lot of cut and paste geometry that are themed after the various fps's I mentioned and sparsely populated with some truly brain dead enemies. The only advantage the A.I. has is the distance from which it can start shooting you, this advantage gets quickly erased based off of the weapons you pick up, specifically the rocket and grenade launchers. That's another issue, you start in a Quake-like and got to the MoH-like with Quake-like weapons. After the MoH-like you're in a Hexen-like facing off against melee enemies with shotguns. It's not a competition, it's not challenging. You just mow your way through some spawn waves and move to the next waypoint. Once you get the rail gun, which has plentiful ammo, it's pretty much over. You can one-shot virtually everything in the game. On top of all of this you can rocket jump without penalty, no self-damage, which puts the A.I. at more of a disadvantage but also allows for some ridiculously fast level traversal.\n\nThe story is kind of enjoyable and is probably what pushed me through the game but I'm glad Bedlam is only five hours long. It didn't overstay its welcome. There's two achievements that I missed earlier to 100% it but I don't think I'll bother to replay the game to get them. Bedlam's not bad but it's something I'd recommend only picking up in a sale.","March 17","true","5.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The controls down to the sensitivity feel great by default whereas I usually have to mess around with that in other games.

The weapons, while there are some you see in other games (which makes sense due to the nature of the game) some are different and pretty fun to mess with.

If you were a child of the 90's and grew up playing PC games, especially FPS, this game is for you.  It ventures through the eras and game engines.  Some of which you'll recognize right away and others not as quick.\n\nI can't really say much more about the game other than that.  It is very intriguing in it's current state.\n\nI'm a little upset to find out this game is based on a novel.  Typically when that happens it means the game is linear.  However it seems that the level design keeps things fresh.  Alternatively, this has really turned me on to the book and I may consider picking up a copy just for a good read.\n\nI do recommend this game, even in early access.  Things look very promising for "Bedlam"","January 6, 2015","true","9.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

From the atmosphere of the game, the main character, the enemies, and the cheesey puns and jokes, it had me enjoying every minute of it.\n\nThe story is fun and easy to follow, if a bit simple, but you'll have no problem progressing through.\nThe retro style in areas mixed with the sudden inclusion of more modern, and then even more ancient games make the game very unique in it's style.\n\nOverall, I'd rate this game a 9/10, as it has me wanting to play through it again and again, and hoping that there'll be a part 2.

The shooting mechanics are very well built and feel amazing when playing.\n\nAnother aspect of the game that I like is the fast movement speed - it makes the game feel much more alive and allows lots more action to take place and the AI's behaviour fits the game perfectly.\n\nOntop of all of the above, the game has jokes in perfect times!\n\nThe downside is that one or two of the voice actors aren't that great, but the majority of the voice acting is spot on.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone without thinking twice, it is a very well built game that plays amazingly.

I started it and finished it in the span of one day.  I couldn't stop playing until I had reached the end.  Was it the best game I ever played?  No.  The story and nostalgia were enough however, to keep me moving through the world.  The gameplay reminded me of my early days of FPS gaming, with nods to Quake, Medal of Honor, Nazi Zombies, and even Planetside.  They also sprinkle in FPS versions of other classic genres.  Some are hits and some are misses but they offer a nice enough variety to break up the game worlds.\n\nPros:\n\n-Nostalgia.  This is probably the make or break point for most people.  If you are not a 90's era gamer, this will not have the same appeal.\n\n-The early story writing is fantastic.\n\n-LARGE variety of weapons.\n\n-Responsive aim controls.\n\n-Lead voice actress does a wonderful characterization with a lovely Scottish accent.\n\nCons:\n\n-LARGE variety of weapons. With so many weapons, it requires cycling even using the number keys.  That means getting the weapon you want or need becomes a chore.  Think texting with a keypad to understand the issue.\n\n-Story writing winds down about halfway.  The humor and characterizations become a bit more predictable as we close upon the ending.\n\n-Platforming segments lead to multiple deaths.\n\nTips:\n\n-Quick save is your friend.  The checkpoint system in the game is unforgiving so do yourself a favor and use that [F5] key to good effect.  It even keeps a couple at a time so you have little chance of quick saving yourself into a corner.\n\n-Health and ammo respawn so make sure you do a run to collect whenever you are faced with a sizable enemy force.","December 27, 2015","true","9.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

This game is one of a kind.\nIt would only be an average rating game if not for so many good ideas. This game feels like a mixture of several FPS games- it takes you to some outer space first, then transfer you to jungles, then back to WWI... I haven't finished it yet probably half way tho, and from the trailer I know there's still a lot to expect-since I saw some pixel games along with other old school games lol.\n\nHowever the shooting experience is not that satisfying. The guns feels the same since they mostly do the same damage(except for the grenade launcher) and you can't save whenever you like and you could die easily if you happened to have a low-health checkpoint. But that's not my case most of the time only had a bit tough time with the Boss but well, anyway it's an indie game.

Not so much.\n\nIt starts well as a generic sci-fi shooter but then it never really develops as it crosses the genres with the slightly floaty handling and high speed movement. It works well as an old-school shooter but as the selling point is cross genres it doesn't really deliver as all we really get is a re-skin of the first level.\n\nIt was a bit buggy as well. I got trapped in a few places and saw some considerable clipping and was fired in the air a few times as well. The level design was ok but the voice acting and script was excellent with well portrayed characters. The difficulty was a little random going from stupidly easy to frustratingly hard often within a single level. You will value the quick save key.\n\nFor a cheap price and if you are fan of Mr Brookmyre it's worth a look.\n\n","November 4, 2015","true","7.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Though buggy Bedlam has quite a bit to offer. Humor and personality abounds from this title and although there are some frustrating aspects (Death or Glory level was a tad too expansive, or was that the joke?) and it is still rather buggy (I am currently invincible as I go throug a survival horror sewer and through the majority of Death or Glory) this game is worth a purchase just for what the title is willing to try out. Starting off in a sci-fi FPS, then to a deathmatch arena, then to a WWII FPS, and I end my current playthrough in the sewers of a survival horror game I can only imagine where it goes next.

All levels are very unimaginative in both visual and gameplay concepts. There are few exceptions with some nice ideas yet usually very poorly executed.\n\nThe element of meta game is the only thing that can make you interested in order to progress in the games as you enter many different levels which are an homage to older games varying from Pac-Man and Space Invaders to Quake 3 Arena and Return to Castle Wolfenstein.\n\nAfter less than 5 hours of mostly dull shooting and running I've reached the final level of the game which I wasn't able to finish. And it surprisingly wasn't because of the mundane level design which is basically consisting of nothing more then purple platforms and swarms of spawning enemies which I later simply stopped paying attention to and just ran trough them envisioning I might be able to finally beat the game but it was because I've encountered a glitch that made me unable to progress any further and practically ruined my previous save files as well. According to the forums I wasn't the first or the last to encounter that very glitch yet developer failed to fix. Only option would be to restart the whole level which may sound as no big deal but the level was so boring and annoying I simply consider life too short to try to beat this game.\n\nEven though I'm a sucker for underdog FPS games I couldn't bring myself to enjoy Bedlam.

The voice acting - when they weren't failing at mimicking accents - was serviceable. And barring the odd need for the female characters to remind you of how much they are totally girls and how much they don't get what they think is proper respect in video games (which does make it seem like the writer has some kind of chip on their shoulder), the dialogue is also serviceable.\n\nWhich leaves us with the actual gameplay, which unfortunately lacking. The game leads you through a series of mockups of other well-known shooters, but what it fails to do is be a worthwhile shooter itself.

Since it's a shooter what you'll be doing the most is shooting things, yet despite that the combat is bad since the enemy hit reactions are non-existent and the weapons pack no punch alongside having extremely lame shooting and reloading (why do the Quake 2 inspired weapons need to be reloaded anyway) sounds. There's almost no music outside a few particular sections which was weird since I don't remember early FPSes being so quiet.\nOne especially annoying thing is that enemy corpses are still considered solid ragdolls so I found myself getting stuck and/or having to jump over enemies I killed.\n\nLevel design is pretty plain and there's not much I can say about it other than the fact that you'll go through extremely typical levels inspired by shooters: there's a bunch of Quake 2 inspired factory/alien planet levels, the obligatory sewer level, and a Medal of Honor war-torn city. They're all exactly as you imagine them to be and there isn't much creativity involved in them. The game tries to have some gimmick levels but they're pretty dull, there's a particular one inspired by Pac-Man which requires you to get every single pellet in a labyrinth while being chased by invencible enemies and it was as tedious as one would expect. Seven or eight levels in I was sent into a level inspired by fantasy games and I had to find a sword. By this point the game was so boring that I had to drop it.\n\nThe only good thing I can say about it is that the dialogue is usually decent. However, sometimes it falls prey to thinking that name-dropping other game titles counts as humour.\n\nI got this for around u$8 and even then I thought it was too much money since there's better games on Steam for that price. You're better off watching a playthrough on Youtube for the story and dialogue rather than wasting your time playing it.

Looked into it as a way to experience some retro shooters, but aside from some minor nostalgia, instead of taking the best elements from them, Bedlam decides to take the worst.\n\n1) Horribly optimized game. I'm running this on a Razer Blade 2015. If you change the resolution, the window size changes meaning that unless I run the game in native 3200p, I have to experience it from a tiny window (NOT fun). Thus, you're forced to run it in your native resolution. Seeing the game's minimal graphics, I wouldn't think this would be a problem, but this game is so poorly optimized, that even on the lowest settings I'm experiencing lag and slowdowns if there's a large area or a large number of enemies, which is absolutely crazy when I can run more demanding games at the same resolution with higher graphics settings.\n\n2) Takes everything bad you know from vintage games. Remember objectives so vague that you don't know where to go and end up exploring a bland, untextured environment for 20 minutes to come across something that says "press enter to continue"? Bedlam has that! Remember enemies that get stuck in invisible walls such that you can't shoot them (even when you literally stand still with a sniper rifle and shoot them in every part of their visible body) yet they can still shoot you? Bedlam has that! Remember levels filled with filler enemies that are nothing more than a waste of your time? Bedlam has a TON of that! Remember platforming sections that are full of boring jumps that take a very long time, but require you to restart the ENTIRE section if you mess up once? Bedlam has those too! Instead of making me remember what I love about vintage shooters, Bedlam stabs them in the back and takes all the WORST elements, and takes out anything meaningfull they contributed to the experience back in the day.\n\n3) It tries to hinge its gameplay on a largely uninteresting story. You find yourself suddenly stuck in a video game, there's a bunch of people just like you that can make glitches to move between the games and there's a force that's trying to prevent them from doing so because it spreads "the corruption" which causes game worlds to stop existing. I don't know why the game thinks that this premise is so interesting that it doesn't need to contribute ANYTHING else to lead to a fulfilling experience, but it definitely falls a bit flat. The characters are relatively likable, but I feel as though their charm relies more on them all having a quirky Australian accent than them actually being fleshed out characters to any degree.\n\nSo what does Bedlam do well? It passes itself off as an indie homage to retro FPS's to an unsuspecting audience incredibly well, while instead taking a huge dump on the history it seems to be trying to raise up.","February 7","false","6.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It starts out pretty alright but later on it just devolves into a boring mess. You start out in an early FPS parody with similar graphics and you're like 'hey, this is pretty alright.'\n\nThe second chapter parodies WWII games and while they were fairly boring in retrospect the level design in this game is atrocious. You have to clear out building after building of snipers and it becomes difficult to continue. Not because the game becomes difficult but because your willpower drains.\n\nAfter this there is one fun part of the game. There is an FPS version of Pac-Man and Space Invaders. The Space Invader parody was meh but the Pac-Man one was pretty fun. I'd actually like to see something like that exist.\n\n\n\n\nNarrative:\n\nThe story is just as poor as the gameplay.

The screenshots looked promising and the game has been updating quite frequently.\n\nMy first impressions was outstanding, what an interesting game. Just starting off in the "simulation" feels like a Quake/DOOM 2 and Half-Life 1 mix with some good humour. The protagonist is funny but her british accent (as well as the other characters) is really f**king annoying. They even spelt Bieber wrong and said a joke claming "Justin Beiber is sh*tty". Yes I said CLAMing, get it? It's funny haha clams instead of claim! Oh wait... that's just a british thing, sorry not funny.\nThose f**king British devs also like to steal other game content/quotes and include it into their game including; Duke Nukem, Call of Duty, MineCraft, BioShock, Grand Theft Auto, Black Mesa (Half Life), Valve Inc., Halo, AND MORE! There's a lot of game cross-referencing. BUT! There is a reason as of why which I will explain under the SPOILERS section.\n\nAnyways, the gameplay is pretty fun. A standard non-ish-linear first person shooter with a lot of collective guns and items hiding around. Strangely if you kill someone and run over their gun you don't pick up the ammo, so you have to look out for them throughout the map, especially health!\nAlot of the characters do have a meaning and reason of being there with deep interactions with the important ones, giving a great story and twist.\n\n*SPOILERS*\n\nOne stage I thought was super funny; "The Rage-Quit Reactor" / Training Stage in the simulation. It's full of little kids that rage and call you a hacker when you kill them, and talk like the typical online children in reality. Lmfao!\n\nThe stage after, set in World War 2 (Kind of like Day of Defeat Source meets Sniper Elite 1). The germans actually speak Deutsche and swear when they die which was pretty amusing. Shooting them with lasers as they look in shock with their Lugers and MP40's. Claiming (or claming? no no sorry Britain not this time) that the American's have super Artificial Intelligence.\n\nSo bascially you're stuck in a simulation and get tossed around different kinds of games. Games that are well known in real life (Quake, Halo, etc.). This is why they reference other games to give it a real-life feel... sounds like hardcore plagerism to me.\nYour inventory builds up with old/new gen weapons so carrying them over into another game which helps benefit against the enemies is a pretty good feature.\nKilling all those b*stard, enemies, that we really don't know much of, yet!?\n\nOverall, besides the annoying and sh*tty typical British voice acting, this game is very pleasing! A great storyline and interesting characters with addicting gameplay. My game although did get stuck at a point where I had to defend a spawn point from the enemies. I did, but the game never recognized that I completed it and was stuck in a loop. Re-loading the game, the mission to defend was never even brought up. So that was game over for me woo I win!!!\n\n7/10","March 23, 2015","true","5.0"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Despite seemingly wishing to be a love letter to past classics, we are never truly treated to the things that made those games great and instead are indulged with but a mention of the matter.\n\nThe guns, for a start, are appalling. Each and every one of them lack any sort of feel and all but one even shoot in the direction they are pointed in. The sniper rifle, in a twist of fate, is one of the least accurate things I have ever attempted to hit a stationary target with. That is if the hit even registers. The accompanying sounds also feel devoid of relation to many weapons, most notably the sword making the sound of rattling chains when swung.\n\nIn addition the movement cannot decide which way it wishes to be so it is stuck in a horrible low gravity, low friction limbo that can grind one to a halt on but a small incline or pebble in the road. It feels worst during the many jump pad sections which have more a habit of throwing up more than forward leaving huge uncertainty of making said jump. Although you never need actually make them, rocket jumps also lack any sort of control. Any sort of explosion seems to just throw force randomly about.\n\nI'd say my final grievance with the game is the main character: wee gamer lassy Athena. Every other sentence out of her mouth is to remind us that yes, she is a girl, and, yes, she does play games, ugh I am so much better than all those silly boys I used to play with being a girl gamer is hard. Lots of name dropping of other games for, from what I made of it, no better reason than to do so and appear hip with the kids. Any dialogue that isnt exposition of the world is a small travesty unto the world.\n\nBut there is an interesting story on it, which is something. Theres a large build-up and very limited character interaction before its just rushed off, spawn deus ex and ♥♥♥♥♥♥"boss"fightend. So actually its not a great story, just a good premise of living in a game world(s) and having to break the system to prevent AI simply over running.\n\nI can only speculate that the book handled it better.

It is very brutal and unfair, with only 1 heath pack that I could find throughout the whole level.  It is a huge level and you can get killed very easily, trying to find anything useful.  There are a ton of empty buildings used to house some enemies, but they only drop ammo and weapons, sometimes...  Other buildings are just empty and are used to lure you to your death from enemies hiding in buildings across from you.\n\nThe biggest problem is the fog.  The enemy can see and shoot you way before you spot them.  Plus your sniper weapon moves a LOT and theirs do not.  They are dead on snipers and they will kill you fast!  Without health packs, it's only a matter of time before you stop reloading your quick save and quit playing.\n\nThen there is the problem of not being able to save during the most intense battle in that level.  IMO, that was a game breaker.  They throw so many enemies at you, it's impossible to get through it without dying.  Then you have to take out a tank with almost zero health!  Even if you back track way back, you cannot save anymore.  It's locked into the "NO SAVE ZONE!!!"  It is a very frustrating experience!\n\nIf you have killed any of the soldiers that are in the "NO SAVE ZONE:, before you trigger the no save feature, and then save your game…  You will have to kill all of the soldiers again, that you lured out of that zone!  It's so frustrating!!!  Again, don't try to lure them out of the no save zone and then save your game.  If you have to reload your save, you'll just have to kill them all over again…  And you WILL have to reload many times trying new strategies, only to die over and over again…\n\nKeyboard bindings will not let you bind commands to some key's!  Why can't I bind Left-Shift?  Kind of the norm these days.  So crouching can be rough.  And you really need to crouch a LOT!!!  Another game breaker for me!\n\nYou also do not stop moving for a second making it hard to judge where you will stop.  This has gotten me killed many times!  Just trying to strafe and shoot is a major chore!   You really need to be accurate and do head shots or the enemy will kill you first!  So movement sucks!  In a FPS, movement is everything!\n\nCollision detection is way off and invisible walls are everywhere. Don't expect to use a vehicle as cover then pop out to shoot.  You'll need to step way away from the vehicle to get past that invisible wall.  I have died too many times trying to kill an enemy 2 feet away and never hit him.  Even with the shotgun!\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=438580301\n\nI really wanted to like this game as I said, I was having fun with the first 8 levels.  I'm stuck on level 9 and will probably not ever play again as I got too frustrated!!!  I may try again when the game is finished, but they really need to fix some game breaking problems for me to play this again.  I'll even change this review if they fix the fog and sniper weapon so I can shoot strait.\n\nEDIT:  I got past that 9th level.  I restarted it and found health packs and armor everywhere.  Maybe the new patch fixed this problem.  Anyway, now I'm stuck in the sewers with no MAP!!!  Silly game IMO...","April 21, 2015","false","5.3"," 11 of 25 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","11","25","0","0"

Its another game that trys to pay homage or compliment video games from the 80s and 90s and again fails. Its nothing more than a reminder that for the most part that era was not very good, i know i was there, so let it be. Let it be.\n\nIn Bedlam you play as a Heather, aka Athena,  a worker for the 'corporation' who volunteers for some brain experiments and then awakens to find herself not only transformed into a half cyborg but transported into the world of video games. Corporate flunky one day killing machine the next as you will fight your way through nostalgic gaming levels in order to escape and learn the truth of what happened. Or will you?\n\nIn the game just like a FPS you will be going from level to level shooting enmies and flipping a switch here and there. Thats pretty much all Bedlam offers. As you enter each level there will be some banter describing the game level which you are about to enter and while some of the games will be recognizeable(Doom, Quake, Halo, COD, etc.), some not so much. One confusing aspect are these glitches that are scattered across the levels. You enter these glithches and they are bascially a large jumping puzzle where you can regain ammo, health or maybe a weapon. None of which you will ever need. My problem with the glitches is they ALL are the SAME. I can understand if there will only be 2-3 scattered thruought the game but there are 1-2 of these glitches across every level. Why did they not make these almost a one opportunity vs. enemies to retrieve a super weapon?  Or take the time to at least make them different?\n\nAs this is a game banking on nostalgia one of the few things it does get right is the speed. Moving around is fast and im guessing well over 100fps but that doesn tmake up for the weak weaponary, sound design and enemies who basically are cannon fodder. But this is the thing, thats excatlly 80s-90s shooters so if they were going for authenticity they nailed it.\n\nI actually was not so down on the game until the last level where it finally broke me. If you take the time time to kill all the enemies and scrounge around it could take you close to 2 hours. It almost felt as if i was transported back to the beginning of the game becasue all you do is repeat everything you have done against the same enemies just in a matrix like enviroment. I finally grew so bored i learned i was able to basically run past a large chunk of the level to get to the end game. Instead of a boss fight you are given a tedious(die easily) jumping puzzle to kill the machine. Dissapointing is a very genourous statement.\n\nIm the first to admit im not nostaglic at all but i do like fast paced shooters today and those that began this crazy hobbey i love. However,  if you are going to make a game today that takes all the ideas from the 80's and 90's and excludes any sort of todays innovations in gaming, then all you are left with is a game from the 80's and 90's. And thats an era that has a long list of bad games that Bedlam has now become a member","March 29","false","9.1"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

The story is very well written and the general feel of the game is nice. There are places near the beginning where the graphics aren't that great, but thats part of the theme. After the few levels the game looks pretty good, not 4k, but good. I would rate this game as a 9/10, the only thing that could be improved is the weapon system, some weapons become obselete further into the game, but you still have to scroll through them to find the one you're looking for and that gets kind of annoying.","May 2","true","6.1"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PangolinTemplar/recommended/261490/","PangolinTemplar","Sprocket","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PangolinTemplar/","504 products in account","TLDR: Read the book instead.\n\nDo you like unerringly accurate hit scan enemies that can nail you from across the entire level? Do you like assets that have hit boxes beyond their visible boundaries *if* the asset itself properly loads in at all? What about enemies that clip and fire through boundaries? Perhaps you're a fan of auto-saves that murder you if you try to load them, focing you to pistol start the level from the beginning? If you enjoy any of these features, then hot damn, do we have a game for you.\n\nBedlam is an interesting concept mired by flawed technical execution. Beyond the aforementioned "features", weapons are bland and have no real impact. A majority of the environments are uninteresting save for the glitch zones. These however quickly overstay their welcome since they are used as giant, empty platforming areas in which to spout exposition as . And then when they decide to put action into a glitch zone during the final level of the game, you'd wish they hadn't. It's a sprawling mish mash of assets and enemies from the rest of the game thrown haphazardly together creating a frustrating, overlong slog. The references are heavy handed, random (LEGO Batman is one of them for chrissakes), and sure to become dated VERY quickly. I *really* wanted to enjoy this game, but ended up finding it disappointing.\n\nIf you still want to give it a shot, I'd suggest letting it get patched and go on sale first.","October 16, 2015","false","4.4"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/muenzz/recommended/261490/","muenzz","Love9","http://steamcommunity.com/id/muenzz/","322 products in account","What a dissapointing clusterfuk of a game. As a person who has never read the book, this just keeps me away from it rather than making me interested in it. Not only did i found the writing rather unintersting, the jokes themself weren't my cup of coffee aswell. What really got on my nerves super quickly was the very heavy scottish accent of basically EVERYONE in this game. I mean, fine, it's based on a scottish book and stuff but this was just painful to my ears after awhile. It also made me care even less about the story, listening to 2 people sounding like caricaturs just doesn't do it for me.\n\nWell, that all wouldn't be so bad if the gameplay wasn't the (probably) most dull experience i ever had in a First Person Shooter. The first level starts out fantastic and you get the idea that this is like Quake, but on a way lower budget. I actually had alot of fun at this part. The setting seemed nice enough and i wanted to see the other worlds.\n\nHowever, after i got to the second world, the World War 2 game, things went down to the bottom of the Earth. Things went on for the rest of the game:\n\n-You get super lazily designed levels, often just a bunch of textures and assets completly recycled put next to another (this was especially terrible in the World War 2 World, where you have to locate 2 keys in order to open a door and progress. Since everything looked pretty much the same i wandered mindlessly around searching every apartment just to locate the key)\n\n-A bunch of weapons which all feel the same (not to mention you get way to freaking many). Some i never even found using myself even once since they sucked compared to most other weapons, some you even get in the first World of the game. Also the Flame Sword made my game lag like crazy, even changing settings didn't help at all.\n\n- The enemies are throughout the entire game the same cannon fodder. The only real variety comes to enemies who are close combat, and those are just as dumb, if not dumber as any other enemy in the game.  What's the point? You get a alot of enemies who don't react to anything, are not really a threat in the first place and will bore you to death as soon as world 2. The bosses are also just a reskin of the first boss you meet, just shoot at it till it dies.\n\n-Hitboxes of enemies don't work alot of times. I had many situations where i fired dead center with the sniper rifle 10 times and he didn't even flinch. However, enemies have no problem shooting at you with any weapon from afar. They instantly spot you once you are in a specific field of sight, and can snipe you easily. This was especially annoying in the last level, because i found myself being shot at only the realize i can barely hurt the enemy snipers.\n\n-This game is a mess technically. Textures appear out of nowhere if you get close to them and dissapear from a different angle. You get stuck on alot of things, including enemy corpses, parts of the level and so on. The game even crashed on me when i switched tabs to check Skype once.\n\n-The worst part is whenever you happen to find a "Glitch" and jump through it. You end up in a weird purple realm, with floating plattforms and a giant bottomless pit beneath. These are the plattform elements in the game, and they are so incredible awful that it downright baffles me on how these even got included in the game. The jumping is super jaggy with a delay in the beginning, meaning you need to time your jump very precisly or you will fall to your death. Deaths here are especially annoying, since the checkpoints are usually at the start of the level, meaning you will probably have to listen to the entire dialoge all over again. Now these level aren't really long, but dying in the end because of the wonky controls and having to try all over again because you didn't feel the need to safe is just obnoxious and not fun at all.\n\n-Whoever put the image macro things in there is super unfunny. That was just painful to watch.\n\nI really liked the idea of this game. I really do. But the execution is done so poorly and without real care that this doesn't even feel like a parody. It just feels like ♥♥♥. And 5 hours for 15 bucks is downright not worth it, even for cheap this game is a questionable recommandation.","November 2, 2015","false","5.9"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

Levels drag on, every weapon feels like a peashooter, badly done platforming in first person, autosaves at the worst times, the damn thing ends on a cliffhanger, and worst of all it tries to poke fun at all the gaming clichés while taking part in them itself without making them fun.\n\nThey have the characters joke about how awful the clichés are, but rather than turn those around and make them clever or enjoyable they just point them out and make you sit there and deal with them. The entire last level is just a platforming section with every enemy and location you fought through earlier in the game re-used in one level. It ends on a crummy boss fight that has a gimmick to beat, and then the developers had the great idea to end their game with a cliffhanger.\n\n"Oh, they're wanting me to fend off waves of zombies, how cliché."\n"...Oh, it actually wants me to sit here for five minutes shooting at the respawning enemies until this portal opens. Great."\n\nThe only part of this game I enjoyed, and the reason I forced myself to beat the game, was for the story, which really wasn't all that interesting to be honest, and the "plot twists" were seen from miles away, since they're once again just old gaming clichés. The main character, Heather, has a really good voice actor, and so do the other characters like Bedlam, but it doesn't save the game from being a generic shooter.\n\nIt reminds me of Eat Lead: The Return of Matt Hazard, a game that did nearly the same exact thing, but in third person. It was also extremely repetitive and generic and forgot that pointing out clichés doesn't make them any better.\n\nI really wanted to like this game, I like the idea of it, it's just executed really poorly. If this didn't have the really well done voice acting this would just be another bad generic shooter.","January 16","false","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The setup is that the player is stuck in video game land traveling through a variety of different first person shooters (and even some other genres too) the protagonist played in the past. It's an homage to the history of the FPS genre, but the games being mimicked are so much better than what's on offer here. The level designs are boring and bare-bones. The weapons are lame and unsatisfying to shoot. The combat is similarly anemic. The whole feel of the game is janky. I do give it credit for one part that gave me a good laugh. There's a part similar to Quake 3 Arena. When an enemy is defeated they accuse the player of cheating or some other typical insult that is very common when playing multiplayer shooters. The story essentially acts as commentary on the genre and its tropes. The problem is that it has less than nothing insightful to offer. The story is full of lame feminist horsesh.t too. So, the game play is slap-dash and generic; and the story is completely forgettable. As far as I can tell, the developer expects us to like this game merely because it references historically popular games. The only thing it does well is that it runs solidly from a technical stand point. That's it. Bad game.","January 23","false","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

WHile I enjoyed the concept and storyline involving being trapped in 90's FPS games I found the actual gameplay lacking. The game has no problem sarcastically pointing out that "those zen levels in Half Life were SO moch fun" while it forces you to do the same tired platform hopping found in 90's shooters. I don't know how many times I fell off a platform while perfoming the same jumping through an empty cyberspace that caps off EVERY level. Aside from that I enjoyed the precesion most guns required (the exception being the incredibly inaccurate ww2 sniper rifle) but I found the the guns lacked audio/visual impact.
