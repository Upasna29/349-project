In PS you are a lion on a mission to become 'lionborn' and rid the Earth of humanity. As you kill more animals and people you'll get higher defcon levels which eventually leads soldiers to try and kill you.\n\n+Decent graphics\n+Simple controls (M&KB)\n+Quite a few different 'enemies' to hunt\n+Once you have got a few kills under your belt civilians will flee from you, sometimes even soldiers run away\n+You can unlock upgrades with one of the currencies you collect\n\n-It's made entirely from assets found in Unity Asset packs, take from that what you will\n-Extreme lack of content, I'd seen everything that's in the game within 25 minutes\n-The game has a twitter feed style interface which displays 'jokes', the jokes get repetitive almost instantly and I found a few of them somewhat offensive\n-Despite what the dev says on the store page this is about as far from a simulator as you could possibly get, it's just another jokey simulator except it's not funny\n-The screaming sound effect gets irritating very quickly\n-Some things don't even soundeffects, such as gunshots\n-Animations are awful and for some creatures, particularly chickens, the animations don't work\n-It's riddled with graphic bugs and glitches\n-It feels like a iOS game, especially with the two currency system\n-One of the currencies is seemingly useless\n-You lose health if you don't eat enough which is a good idea but the health bar goes down very quickly\n-Not much in the way of environmental interaction\n-Only one map which is not only incredibly small but as far as I'm aware it's an unedited map from a Unity asset pack\n-Most importantly I did not have fun playing it\n\nVerdict:\nDon't buy it.\n\nPredator Simulator is a clear attempt at making a game similar to Goat Simulator but sadly it falls flat in a ridiculous number of ways. Unless this gets some major content added and gets its issues fixed I simply cannot recommend this game.\n\n***Written using a free key***\n\nEl K.","May 20, 2015","false","1.3"," 135 of 155 people (87%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","87","135","155","6","14"

Swapped to 'negative' for now. Check comments.\nOne map containing a smallish sized city. Objectives generally involved killing something, complete that and receive another mission. Gradually the 'DEFCON' level raised which increased both amounts and types of enemies that spawned. Killing stuff rewarded gold and gems which could be used for purchasing new enemies, seemed a bit strange.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaS1cOt-eTw\nMore then a few issues with the spawn systems. Sometimes things would vanish, other times stuff just went crazy and stretched everywhere upon devouring it. Need to keep eating things to keep your health level up otherwise you died. After death you can respawn on the same quest (rather then restarting) by using some of the gems collected. Sound was dodgy or amusing, whichever way you look at it, male bums constantly screamed like girls for example. Control wise I actually preferred the kb+mouse but gamepad and keyboard were both fine.\n\nOverall it feels a bit on the cheap side and price should be lower. Won't be hours of fun here, just a short 10-20min bash every now and then to release your inner lion. Small price drop, few tweaks and maybe another level or two in future would go a long way. Will vote up because stuff can be fixed and prices adjusted, but it would certainly be a "sideways" thumb for now if steam had the option.. Cheers folks and happy gaming. :)","May 15, 2015","false","1.3"," 94 of 118 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","94","118","3","8"

' with lenny's face,  or "#Fml dropped my phone on the toilet "  OR  " in russia predators drinks vodka '\nYou know the typical internet fad bs comments that you see that are slightly funny but seriously overused.\nAnd the character description "Console peasant " And what not is just not necessary and lame to be honest, sorry for being so harsh but gotta stay honest\nI also disliked how the characters spawns from under or next to you, looks so buggy.\nAlso when you die you can respawn by spending gems which is lame because thats an Ios game feature ....*sigh*\n\nSo basically after 10 minutes you can understand everything in the game, it gets so repetitive and gives you no actual reason to carry on with it so you'll probably alt+f4 after 20 minutes.\n\n\nSo\nPros - Good controls.\n- Game looks good and the design is not bad.\n- ..... uh .. thats it ?\n\nCons  - no actual content to carry on with\n- completely boring after 20 minutes.\n- the characters keep screaming nonstop and makes you mute it.\n- buggy character spawns and a lot of bugs in the game.\n- Missing features that could'v made the game worth while such as Cards and achievements.\n\nConclusion.\nSeriously, if you have 5.99$ and want to waste it and hate yourself for it then get this game, a 57mb download and 2 minutes of fun and the rest is agony.\n\nI honestly think they could'v made the game price 0.99$, MAYBE then it would have been worth downloading.","May 20, 2015","false","1.7"," 63 of 82 people (77%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","77","63","82","4","7"

Additionally, English is not my native language, so please bear with me ;)\n\nPredator Simulator Review\nYou play a "Predator" and attack and eat animals and people with no real goal, except reaching a high score/"Defcon level".\nTo survive, you have to constantly kill and eat to fill your health. Later, you also have to avoid or fight hunters that want to put an end to your killings.\n\nYou can "roar" to stun (or later damage) anything around you, run, attack & eat. Very basic but enough though I'd love to be able to "jump" once in a while.\nThere are 2 "quests" active at any time which range from "Kill/Eat X of something" up to "Collect X stars" or "Survive X minutes". Those quests - when fulfilled - reward gems and gold. Gold can also be aquired by killing/eating pretty much everything. Gems are used to unlock upgrades and the gold is used to improve them, afterwards.\nBy killing and eating or collecting Stars, your "Defcon level" raises which means you are a higher threat. At some points, new people will walk around the town and stronger hunters will appear.\n\nThe game "ends" when your health bar is depleted though you can continue by investing some gems.\n\nPros:\nFunny idea\nEasy controls\nGraphics are OK for a casual game\nCons:\nThe area you play in is ridiculously small - I mean: Come one! One forest, one small town... that's it?!\nGraphics are glitchy like hell, I've been thrown 100m in the air, walked around with the prey in my mouth and more! This is actually very funny but I still have to list it as a "con"\nAt least one quest is seriously: Collecting X stars often doesn't count the stars.\nStars are extremely rare/hard to spot (some "map" would have been useful - call it "instinct" for "realism" and you're done ;))\nThe sounds are repetitive and extremely annyoing\nThe skills' costs are totally unbalanced, also, there is not much use for gems after you unlocked everything\nSpawns are unbalanced, too. After some time, there are almost only hunters and "Kill 15 supporters" is almost impossible.\n\nTL;DR:\nI got this game for free and for that "price", it's OK.\nOtherwise, I can only "recommend" to get this game if you like trashy games and if it's on sale and there's no way that I can recommend the current version of the game otherwise.\n\n\nBTW: when maxing all abilities, you can read "AWESOM" - well, where's the "E"? ;)","July 23, 2015","false","1.5"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","1"

The price tag wasn't huge, but with as many games as I've played, I know what I can reasonably expect for that price. I posted a short review stating my opinion, to which the developer, GameIndica, responded almost immediately. Combining my input with that of others, he released not one, but two launch day patches which addressed most of our concerns. Any developer who cares that much about customer feedback has his heart in the right place. This alone helped me feel that he more than earned not only my $6, but also a better review. So here's the skinny:\n\nBasics\nThis is a small game about being a lion eating everything that moves. I'd call it more of an arcade game than a simulator. The basic objective is to convince the population that you are as great a threat as possible (raising DEFCON levels) in order to earn the biggest rewards (coins and diamonds)  which you can then invest in upgrades to make your lion more deadly.\n\nVisuals\nThe graphics get the job done, but won't blow you away. The art style is like a children's cartoon show, with bright colors and bobble-headed characters (except also with blood and corpses). Some of the character models are funny enough on their own that they made me smile. Animations are amusing enough, but can get repetitive after a while.\n\nSounds\nThe screams and shouts coming from the NPCs definitely add to amusement factor. Like the graphics, they're cartoony and fun. Though technically not sounds, the little speech bubbles that pop up on screen have some pretty funny memes to offer. The atmospheric sounds do their job nicely, adding a layer of depth without being obtrusive. Music is not present, which is fine by me. I usually end up turning off music in a game like this in favor of internet radio or something. Eating people to the sounds of The Prodigy, for example, is a great time :)\n\nControls\nThe controls are a little wonky at first, but they are basic enough that I got used to them quickly. I strongly recommend a gamepad. Gamepad recognition is quick and easy. Just turn it on at any point before or during play - no menu options to set up. The controls feel good once you've gotten used to them. Running with your lion at top speed (after all speed upgrades) is genuinely fun, and lunging at three or four targets, killing them all, is very satisfying.\n\nGameplay\nOverall, this little game will probably provide you with a few good hours of late night entertainment. This is just the kind of thing I like after a long day and a few beers - light arcade-style gameplay that doesn't require a huge time investment or mental focus. The upgrade system feels a little limited and some expansion of it would add replay value.\n\nOverall\n7/10 - Not a masterpiece, but a fun offering from a new developer. If this appeals to you and you want to expand your library, you'll probably be happy with what you get for the $6 price tag, but if you're on the fence I'd recommend buying it on sale. The developer's quick and positive response to criticism definitely made this into a "thumbs up" review and give me reason to look forward to future releases from him.","May 15, 2015","true","6.0"," 3 of 32 people (9%) found this review helpful","9","3","32","0","11"

I'm going to explain what the best parts are about this game right now!\n\nFirst of all, when you play the game the quality is set to the best one which games don't really do. If you click outside the window in windowed mode then the game will actually pause which I think is a really nice feature to have. It loads quickly (even quicker than modern console and PC games do) and has a nice main menu. The process of getting from the menu to the game is really quick because you are already at the place the game starts at. The animals are easy to kill so you don't have to worry about them that much. The graphics are perfect for the sort of game and the cartoon like physics just make it even better. The controls can be hard to master at first but soon you will be a true lion going around and eating people. One of the most funniest moments is when people sometimes glitch out and their model stretches everywhere which has now been fixed :(\n\nThe hunger makes you think about whether you should go somewhere isolated or not without upgrades. The game play is so great and everyone should play it. Let me reword that: PLAY IT RIGHT NOW!!!!!\n\n(Also why do people not like a review that is positive?)\n\nAs a note: I will not change this review just because a lot of people hate this game. I like it so there is no point to get me to change anything.","May 15, 2015","true","0.7"," 25 of 178 people (14%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","14","25","178","23","21"

It calls itself a predator simulator, but how the game works is anything but it. The entire game is you running around this tiny town biting and eating people/animals. As you kill more, higher level enemies spawn until you die, then you start again. That’s literally the game. You get quests that are “eat this many people”. Oh and you know how lions have to eat every 15 seconds or they die, because you do. Your life quickly runs out meaning you have to be eating constantly. If you want to look around the town or do anything besides continually eat every second you will die like I did. Then you have to start all over again. You get gold but it doesn’t seem to do anything. You have a roar and a bite. You can upgrade powers but it requires crystals, which I never once saw. 5 minutes will show you everything this game has to offer, which isn’t really anything. Guess the developer is a do-uche anyways so I don’t feel bad for speaking the truth on this one.","September 21, 2015","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sounds fun...  If it is done right that is.  Sadly it isn't and here's why:\n\n- There is a bad art style inconsistancy that comes off as annoying after a while.  Think of it as an ice cream sundae with onion bits and raisins in it.  Both have a sweet flavor, but they should not be together.  Realistic lions, stylized animals, and anime people should not be togther unless done right (See SSB4).\n\n- Game models tend to glitch up like cartridge tilting in 007 Golden Eye.\n\n- Memes...  Why did there have to be memes in this game?  The game is doomed to be dated and ridiculed for it.\n\n- Basic video game 101: When the player dies and respawns, they should be taken to a danger-free point or given invincibility for a brief time.  This game lacks that and many lives were wasted.\n\n- Missions start out easy and then the system flat out slows down to a snail's pace due to bad programming.  For example, there is a mission where you have to collect 3 stars.  Not only they were hard to find, any star collected after star 1 did not count.  The Stormtroopers for their associated mission rarely appear.  The toughest enemy in the game appeared more often before I reached the halfway point.  This causes problems with getting lives and upgrades.\n\n- Missions resemblr those MMORPG missions that seem tedious.  Lame!\n\n- The game is just flat out too repetative.\n\nEven if you love the idea of playing a big cat, do not buy this game.","November 14, 2015","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Missions can ask you to find stars around, survive for some time, kill civilians or even eat them. And it repeats. That is the main problem of the game, it's obsolete.\n\nThe map is too small, not enough ennemies, not enough collectibles, not enough skills. In a single gameplay, you will unlock almost everything and see everything. Once you've found everything, you can joke with your friends but that's all.","September 12, 2015","false","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The UI, the currency, the playstyle of trying to get further with each attempt and more upgrades. It's really not suited for PC. Nevertheless it seems interesting at the start eating chickens and avoiding bear (lion) traps then moving into the city to eat people with whacky physics. But that's when the screaming starts. That's going to haunt my dreams tonight.\n\nIt's just not fun. There's nothing to do after 10 minutes of running around listening to the screaming and reading the meme filled "jokes" on the side. Also I have no idea where they got their DEFCON system from because I've never heard of one with so many levels. That's putting aside the fact that DEFOCN levels are supposed to go down to 1 not up to infinity as there is more danger. So much for it being a simulator.","August 18, 2015","false","0.2"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

It was OK until i got to the Chris Hansen boss fight, but EVERY DAMN TIME, he already knows where im going before i get there, and i wind up sitting in that damn chair, in the spotlight answering his stupid questions. CURSE YOU CHRIS HANSEN!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbut in all seirousness, no, this isn't a good game. It's worth grabbing if you get it in a bundle, or for 99 cents or less. It is nothing but a cheap imitation of Goat Simulator, where you are instead a lion, and it does a horrible job of being that. do not buy.","August 8, 2015","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
