It was a lot of fun then, and since then it has had numerous improvements and fixes and extra features added.\n\nIt's a sandbox top down space shooter with both manual and RTS controls and empire management. You can pilot your ship and go bounty hunting, fight pirates, or trade. As you get money you can buy more ships, set up automated traders, build stations of your own, and even start your own empire that can compete with and conquer the AI empires. You can fly your ships manually, or just tell them what to do and watch. In combat you can just give orders to your fleet, or hop around controlling ships willy nilly if you like. Or play a single ship and have the rest following your orders.\n\nWhat I really love about it is what you do actually affects the universe.\n\nIf you're a bounty hunter, you aren't hunting randomly generated quest opponents - you are actually hunting threats to that empire - pirate and other ships (like Swarm) who have been destroying their ships and earning a bounty. You also have competition - other bounty hunters are actively hunting the same list of bounties.\nIf you do trade missions to bring supplies to end a shortage at a station, you actually supplied that station - which will then start producing stuff.\nIf you pirate ships carrying supplies for ship part factories for a faction, that faction will not only be out the ships you blew up in the process - but it will have less parts to build new ships.\nIf you blow up a big military fleet of a faction, that faction will be weakened against both you (if you're running an empire of your own) and other AI empires until it can rebuild that fleet.\nIf you set up stations to bolster a faction's economy, not only will you make money - the faction will be better off.\n\nPlus there is a huge appeal to me with starting as a single ship and working your way up to conquering the map as a faction.\n\nStarting options lets you get into the game how you like it - as a single ship, as a pre-existing empire, and a lot of options in between (like being in charge of a small pirate fleet). You can also select from any of the technology groups in the game, which influences what ships and factories you can build.\n\nI definitely recommend this game. The game has a free version available too to make sure you like the basic premise, albeit with less features (totally worth buying the full version). So give the free version a try - if you like it, buy it.","February 19","true","40.4"," 67 of 78 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","67","78","0","5"

It basically plays like the X series except well its 2D, the pace is faster, and it could use some polish in certain part of the gameplay.\n\nAnyways lets get on with the review! There's not really much to talk about in the intro section.\n\nGraphicsLets get this out of the way first, it uses asset packs from the AI war series.  So don't go in expecting fancy graphical settings and so on. But at least its not terrible to look at for one thing. Ok it might be a little be bad if you're not used to it but for a heavy space simulation game like this graphics would be a little be a little be lower on the list.\n\nSoundJust your average typical synth space music for the ambient that you might want to mute off and put on something else after 5 continous hours of pay because eventually they grate on your ears like cheese grater at the end of it. Meanwhile the average sound effects are just pew pew pew for guns and lasers and muted boom for explosion.\n\nNothing really impressive here but hey it works. Kinda.\n\nPerformanceAnd here's my favourite part of it. You see you can adjust most things from interpolation, resolution, some settings to set compatibility and increase FPS but if you happen to have an anamolous configuration like me the game will be very finicky. As in it will randomly throw out issues at you at random time. I had sprites corrupted, game crashes, spike lags, and so on. It even hates my mobile Radeon graphic card for some reason so I had to disable that and use my intel integrated graphics.\n\nBut when it does work it works very well at 60 fps and almost no lag. But do note the most important part of your configuration will be your processor. The graphics may not be pretty but a lot of process are running constantly in the background and for the largest map it taxed my i5 processort to 100% usage for all 4 core pretty much all the time. Smaller map while... less fun do offer slightly better performances.\n\nThat said it does depend on your final configuration setup so you might get a lot more mileage with it than me with the game.\n\nGameplayThe gameplay in UG is pretty simple. At the start of the game you can choose a list of preset maps [that are pretty resource heavy] or from the randomly generated maps that way less fun than the preset maps but will not set your computer on fire from the sheer amount of background processing. Then you choose your starting type ship type and empire affinity. You pretty much immediately start off as an empire in this game and everybody will treat you as such [even though you might only have 1 ship].\n\nSo assuming you pick the default starting merchant class there are a few things you can do in UG. First you can configure your drone ship to start trading supplies for you autonomously while you lay back and watch as the money increases in the background or you can also do a few jobs while the drone does its job that ranges from killing people, ferrying supplies, to destroying bases and these missions are dependant on which faction and base you pick them off from. Drones [and other ships] can also be set to autonomously patrol, hunt for bounties, and a few other things and task that you can set them with.\n\nYou can interact with the faction and improve your standing with them by doing missions but faction relationship can be improve simply bribing a lot of money if you wish although there's a hard cap to how much you can do this.\n\nMaps are divided into sectors, wormholes provide quick transportation from one point to another while jump drive provide localize instant transportation between close nearby sectors. Late in the game you can make your own wormhole but as of early point you will be most likely be\n\nThe end goal of this game can be freely decided by you but assuming you want to 'win' the game sort of to speak you need to obliberate every factionand come out on top. To do so you need money to build builder ships which will build space stations that allows other factions to trade with you and generate more income. Once you build up a sizeable base you can then start to build military bases and shipyards outside of enemy control point, this will allow you to finally claim a sector for your own and begin your first foothold in conquering the universe. Pumping out fleets of ships while setting their AI, declaring war on other factions and ruthlessly destroying would then be your main objective and at that point you can simply start building your own wormhole that will not allow others to travel into. A true empire so as to speak from a lowly beginning so as to speak.\n\nThat said money isnt too terribly hard to earn and a typical game will just be over in 5-8 hours [I had half the galaxy conquered in 5] which makes it a lot more fast pace that most other space empire simulation game out there. Being a trader only is also viable and fun since you have to acquire bodyguards and make your own trade and space stations to maximise the amount of profit that you will get.\n\nRandomly to mix things up a few random event might happen to you and it is up to you to adapt to their coming.\n\nConclusionAt this present time UG is a completely playable game, you can start from a humble beginning and end as an empire and the speed in which you do so is rather addicting with few downtime in between. That said a lot of things could use a little bit more polish to it which includes the UI, the trade section, more automation stuff, and further faction interaction but that could all come afterward.\n\nFor now its a pretty fun space empire management game [especially the trading screen watching the money go up cha ching cha ching cha ching] and since its feature complete and fully playable at the moment that is all fine for now. Although, people who had never play this kind of game should note that the learning ladder is rather steep but once you are at the top its easy to do a checklist.\n\nForgot to mention, the game does have a built in game editor so you can make up your own sector and adjust parameters for the ships. It's also rather easy to make up your own mod for it if you want to.\n\nScoring Methology:\n-	S-Rank: excellent\n-	A-Rank: very good\n-	B-Rank: solid\n-	C-Rank: satisfactory\n-	D-Rank: inferior\n\nVerdict: B-Rank\n\nCredit:Thanks to meatking and smmoke for your help!\n\nNo drama, Just Reviews","February 19","true","13.4"," 63 of 86 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","63","86","2","2"

The good stuff is : the ability to make ships auto-trade and auto-mine asteroids to start building you a nest-egg for your future empire. Getting this is no problem at all and is very nicely done.\n\nThe combat however is very break-neck speed in my opinion. Big ships that cost quite a bit of money can die if you dont immediately start evasive maneuvers to get out of combat and kite enemies...that is unless you grossly outnumber the enemy, which can take a bit of time, even for small pirate factions.\n\nCouple this with the fact that the game never tells you what weapons do differently than each other(even trying to guess visually is very rough), the one dimensional defense modules that just add shields: which all seem to get blown away with very little effort...and this makes managing a small combat fleet disappointing.\n\nBuilding an empire is fun in this game. You get to build a lot of trade infrastracture that spans the entirety of a galaxy. But the lack of information on which ships have enough cargo room to build can set the player back at least 10-20 minutes of game time if they do not guess right. On top of this, there is a big system of infrastructure required to get ship parts and supply. which is also not that well explained in the game. This really stops you from enjoying the fun nature of this game for another couple of hours.\n\nOverall, this game has potential to be a very fun 2D , real time 4X, that gives us what we want - adventures in a big galaxy on a small scale that lead to massive galactic warfare in the end. But getting to the end is a big pain in the ♥♥♥ and is just not as fun as it sounds when you see what is happening in the game and know what it takes to get there.","February 22","false","3.9"," 60 of 86 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","60","86","2","4"

Another issue is the UI takes some time to get the hang of, and finally the game lacks clarity on a lot of its mechanics which forced me to test a lot of stuff to figure out how exactly some of the game worked but...\n\nPutting those issues aside I love this game, I absolutely love it.\n\nIt's a large 4X RTS where you can play as a single ship or up to an entire empire. You can scavage battlefields for parts, you can hunt bounties, you can be a trader, you can claim territory, colonize planets, be a pirate, bring down empires, build them, create a space industry of your choice with factories ranging from farms to computers, to fire arms, fight rogue AI or space monsters, and a lot more.\n\nYou are placed in a simulated galaxy and then told to do whatever you want, that's what Unending Galaxy is, and it will likely become one of my new favorite games.\n\nAs for the dev they seem great, I've asked a few questions and put a few issues on the forum already and the dev was just about the first person to answer all of them, even more so he's already making changes in the next patch based on a couple issues I had, rare to have that kind of on-point activity.","February 21","true","48.3"," 33 of 41 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","33","41","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lumizeal/recommended/439720/","lumizeal","Luminaire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lumizeal/","292 products in account","This little game actually surprised me.. Quite a bit so.. It's very simple, yet complex enough to be fulfilling. It has done an excellent job of finally satisfying that craving for a simple space empire/fleet building game.\n\nThere are a few things that I feel could have been done better, and i'll cover those second.. But first, onto the positives!\n\n1- Simple and effecient!\nThis is where this game surprised me. I am really impressed with the control and management given to the players in this form. Want to play rpg style with a single ship as your own? Or have a small fleet of escorts? You can do that. Want to play rts style where you tell a few ships, or large quantities of ships to perform specific actions? You can do that too. Want to just sit back, and stare at a spreadsheet and operate your vastly growing empire without directly controlling any ships? You can do that too, All the while not being hassled to mine/farm repetatively for 20 hours before you start your own empire. You can do that right off the bat. Additionally, while you do have control over your own faction ships and structures, civillian activity is present aswell. The structures you build will automatically spawn civillian ships which will act like free-willed npcs to participate in the growth of your empire. Whether that be mining, trading, or even bounty hunting. You do not need to manage them on your own, and there is no loss when they get their little pea shooter box-car bounty-hunter blown up by a dreadnaught pirate.\n\n\nUnending Galaxy has managed to mash all this together in one simple and efficient design where one method of play does not clash with another, all in the same game session. Nor are you required to do one over the other. The controls are simple and straightforward enough, without the hassle of selecting gamemodes or setting things up. Simply generate your world, and off you go.\n\nThe AI works. You can assign different roles and goals for all your ships individually, or in groups, and the optional automation is self-sufficient.\n\nNow. There are a few things that you need to be wary of though. They are not greatly impacting in terms of gameplay, but they may be unappealing to some.\n\n1- The graphics. While this does not hold a huge impact on my judgement for this game (as i've all but been able to see past it all), the game does not use original assets, and the most beautiful visuals are the planets. (Like, really beautiful!).. Some assets are open source assets, which included a ship i used to make my first mod in Endless Sky (That was amusing to see!)\n\n2- Spaceship movement. First and foremost, while I can't confirm this, I feel like the ships use sprite sheets rather than a single sprite rotation system. This means, that while there is a 360 degree turning and piloting mechanism, the sprites do not support directional visuals for all 360 degrees. It feels more like there is a sprite every 15 or so degrees, so rather than seemless turning, it is jolty. This was a huge turn off when i first started playing, but it didn't take long for me to forget it was there.\n\n3- Lastly.. Crashes..\nThat dreaded thing that no one wants to see in a review of a full release game. On the bright side, the dev(s) are still actively patching or otherwise working on improving stability.. As things are now though, I believe i've experienced a crash every 2-3 hours of gameplay.. Admittedly though, i'm extremely tolerant of crashing issues, provided they don't happen every 15 minutes...\n\nOne final note, is that when I first got this game, I was not able to launch it. I was having issues that was ultimately determined to be my AV.. But before that was figured out, the dev was very helpful in trying to get my issue resolved, and even offered that if my attempts to make the game work went past the refund policy for steam, he would send them an exception to allow me to refund it. I'm glad that it was not necessary, as I've had a lot of enjoyment with this game.","March 27","true","37.0"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","1"

Mind that most of my play time wasn't logged on Steam.\n\nIn UG, you're free to pick your goal, map, gamestart and playstyle, or you can jump-in on the default settings and try to take over the galaxy!\n\nOn default, you start with one Transport (Trader) ship and one Cruiser (Combat) ship. This gives you a few opportunities:\n- Automate your Trader (to trade automatically or to mine), and hunt bounties with your Cruiser.\n- Automate your Cruiser (to hunt for bounties or raid ships), and perform trade and missions with your Transport.\n- A few other options.. ;)\n\nThe game is full of such choices. When it comes to diplomacy, you could choose to turn a Galaxy full of hate in one full of peace, or simply turn it all into a free-for-all warzone!\n\nAs you build up your credits as an independent pilot and fleet commander, you'll eventually have enough money to buy a Dock Builder (Construction Ship), which will enable you to start your own empire, produce your own goods, own territory and construct ships for free with the Ship Parts you've produced yourself.\nAnd again, you can choose wether to start taking over other empires through war, backstabbing or diplomacy.\n\nTherefore, the strengths of the game really lie on its freedom, and on the ability to assign different roles to your ships by automating them with different AI modules (Trader, Miner, Police, Bounty Hunter, Military, Pirate Raider, Scavanger and maybe others). Building your empire and evading difficult situations through diplomacy is also fun, and finding different ways to deal with the challenges the game pit you against.\n\nThe problems lie at the fact the game is a niche game. There IS a learning curve, the controls and UI are not 100% intuitive to people who are not used with this genre and, even though the game has a very wide scope, it was and is being developed by a single person - so bugs and issues were probably going to exist.\n\nHowever, the developer has a great habit of fixing critical things first, listening to suggestions and continuously improving and polishing the game.\nAs you may've noticed, there were three patches in the first week after release, and the developer has plans for the future and planned improvements for different areas of the game, and will probably release a roadmap in a few days.\n\nIf you enjoy Sandbox, Empire-Building or Space-themed games, UG is a keeper!","February 26","true","4.1"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dbrnonymous/recommended/439720/","Dbrnonymous","Dbrn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dbrnonymous/","314 products in account","This game reminds me a lot of how the X series games play along with some Distant Worlds and some top down space shooter added in.  It doesn't have cutting edge 3D graphics, but the aesthetic still feels great, the art is smooth yet crisp.  While it does use a lot of the ship assets from AI War, they still manage to feel fresh and don't detract from the value of the game at all.\n\nFrom starting with a full empire to play it as a 4X strategy game, to starting with a small fleet or even a single ship to make it feel more like a sim, there is something here for you if you enjoy these types of games. There are 11 Starting Scenarios, 7 total handcrafted non-tutorial maps, a procedural map generator and a faction customizer which ends up offering a lot of replayability.  You can have a small knife fight galaxy or a huge 1800+ sector sandbox universe plus many other variable to fine tune how you want the universe to ultimately run.\n\nI feel the music is standard for a small indie studio and I feel the sound effects could be better, but neither really detract from the gameplay and they are satisfactory.  Not too much to suggest here as I know how expensive these assets can be to acquire if you want superb and unique non-library music/effects.\n\nTo me, the game is great, I've had quite a bit of fun just trying out different starts and seeing what the gameplay has to offer both on the 4X end and the sim end.  At the basic level, it's very much trade, fight, build, think with the opportunity to play it as a nearly full featured 4X.  I say nearly because obviously some things are missing, like a researchable tech tree.  Your tech is actually pre-determined while setting up the game.  I do not feel that this takes away from the experience whatsoever, but it could for you if you prefer the traditional research trees.\n\nOne of the great aspects of the game is, like Distant Worlds, you can automate a lot of tasks and though it does not reach the level of Distant Worlds, it's not as complicated as that game either so it does not need as much.  For me, it is the right amount.  If you don't like all that automation, you can of course control everything yourself, you can even create control groups and play it as a typical RTS, right clicking your attack groups to wherever you like.\n\nThe biggest common complaint that I see popping up is the depth of the tutorial.  While for me personally, I felt it was fine and was able to easily figure out whatever was not answered in the tutorial simply by playing, I do understand that this is an issue for those not used to this type of gameplay.  It's important to note that this is on the list of things to fix along with the other issues.\n\nAside from the readability of the text font on my screen (which I have been able to work around thanks to some help), I do not have any big complaints about this game that would warrant a thumbs down.  In fact, quite the opposite as you can see.  The sheer fun of the game, the option to play it in different ways, the helpfulness of the developer, and the price (a steal in my opinion), this is a fine entry to the 4X Strategy/Space-Sim market.","February 23","true","18.8"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

The developer released an update 2/22/2016 around 1:30am EST, less than 12 hours after I posted this review. While the resolution scaling issues are not fixed, the update is a step in the right direction and I was able to get the game working at a lower resolution with the external config. I've decided to change my review and cancel the refund request. A developer that pays this much attention to their customers and can pump out a fix within 12 hours on a Sunday clearly cares about their customers, fans, and their game. Whether or not I end up enjoying the game, I'm willing to give my money to a developer like this.\n\n\nThe UI is terrible. I didn't even play the game. I couldn't. The Start Game button was off-screen, unless I changed the resolution to 1024x768 on my 1080p screen. Tried changing to 1920x1080 fullscreen... and 50% of the game was off-screen.

You build factories, you build ships and you can fly them yourself or play it like an RTS, which is fun too. Ships can be automated (to go hunting, trade, mine etc.) so you don't have to do all the micromanagement.\n\nIt still needs alot of balancing stuff to be done. I also miss the option to be part of the existing empires/factions. It seems like you are forced to have your own faction (might be, because I always choose Mogul as my starting scenario).\nHowever, the devs are working on the game and there are updates each couple of days.\n\nOverall it is worth the money, the devs asking for and I'm looking forward to spend more time in this game.","March 8","true","10.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Once a player understands the controls, it is comparitively quick to play compared to other 4X games and yet still has a great deal of depth and a range of options for playability for various styles.    For a person like me who has a lot of personal demands upon my time, this has been a great way to feed my 4X game appetite.    I feel like in my dozens of hours of game play that I have hardly hit the surface of the game on many levels, and yet, the economic system and combat are straightforward and fast.  At times, I micromanage as much as possible while at others, I put my ships on autopilot and sit back and watch the action.    It has the feel of a universe which I am still exploring...and a game which will occupy many hours and days of my time.","February 25","true","201.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Then I set the game to run in Direct X 9 Legacy mode which helped a lot for me and I get barely any crashes at all.\n\nThe good about the game is... if you can run it, its pretty fun. The price tag of 11,99 Euro atm is in my opinion set too high, since the game has still some serious crashes (can still not go to game settings from ingame and have to use the game settings out of game before starting the game to change things). Also the economy and number of ships is not nearly as complex as for example a X-series game (which the game creator is a modder of). I think the game still lacks a lot of content and it could need a more fleshed out economy. Also the battles are a lot too fast... sure there is a combat mod that makes some changes, so that combat is slower and more meaningful than just pewpew boom battleship gone, but I think the core game should also lean a lot more in such a direction, basically more away from that arcady feeling and more to a full-scale 4x where you have a slow build-up and your bases and economy has a bigger meaning. It would be also nice to do more with your own sectors when you have some... as far as it is atm you build stations into your sectors and thats pretty much it... I would like to have more defence structures, maybe even minefields and such... I would like to be able to customise the automated patrolships in my sector (amount and kind of and such) maybe that could be also imbued by adding for example a fleet headquarter for stronger patrols and fighter bases for more smaller patrols or something like that.\n\nAll in all the game has a good idea behind it. The technical execution is not that good atm, it needs quite more polishing.  Also it needs a lot more base game content, sure the game is heavily modable and modders already did come up with smaller mods but to get more people into the game (and more bigger mods in the end) it would be good to lure in a bigger audience with more and of course more fleshed out content. What would also help to make the economy more meaningful... make ship building for the own faction and the AI more complex and as I said combat slower and more meaningful. Give players and AI more tools to protect their assets and add more content in general (would like a lot more ship types like corvettes, cruisers with different niches and something bigger than a battleship maybe to have as a flagship). Thats in my opinion what would help this game a lot and take it from "oh a small nice game that I play for a few hours" to "WOW... and its also heavily modable... I am so gonna make a mod for it and play that game forever".\n\nI know as a user its always kind of easy to point out the weaker parts of a game and say "oh that needs more work" and all. Still keep in mind this is a one man show and he is fixing as fast as possible and will add more content to it as far as I did read on the forums (and I believe him). The game will get there to be that masterpiece we all would like to have, but it still needs time and some deep balancing changes.\n\nSo... why a positive review?\nIf you want to help a dev in getting the game to a broader audience and dont mind the 11,99 Euro price tag you should jump in with both feet. If you have a lot of crashes and graphical odd behavior like me, try the Direct X9 legacy mode, helped me. Also I think you have to see this kind of game here as some kind of early access and not as finished triple A title.\n\nSo If you have no problem to get a game thats not labeled Early Access but should be, then buy... help the dev make it bigger and better with your money, feedback and maybe even mods (as far as I did read he also needs more ship models and stations and such, if you have some or know how to make some, maybe contact him?)\n\nIf you mind buying a game for 12,99 Euro that needs quite some work (not meaning the content and content balance here, but especially the technical side), then wait a while and see how it turns out.\n\nI think the game is worth playing. If you want to have a more polished experience its worth having it on your radar for a while and then jump in.","February 29","true","18.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Events are well thought out, and provide good universe story telling I haven't seen all of them but I hope there are more in future updates. Music is fine I personally am not crazy about it, but I see it's appeal. Stability wise I've run into a crash or an error for every 4ish hours of leaving the game running since the last patch.\n\nFocusing on the 4 x aspects:\nEconomy in the game is modelled pretty well and tied to the questing system and the player feels like you are actually a part of the economy, however some factions feel too player dependant and fail to keep up with other factions unless actively supported. Automation makes it easy to manage your faction and allows you to work on a variety of tasks as the player without having to micro every ship.\n\nI really enjoyed combat, once familiar with the controls battles become much easier but still manage to stay interesting. Combat requires skill, I was able to take down 2 capital ships, a carrier and it's escort with a single fast cruiser, and I have lost player controlled capital ships to fighters.\n\nI recommend tutorials for empire building if you are new to these types of games,I jumped right in because I am used to space 4x games and it took me an hour to figure out that I needed to transfer funds from trades into other parts of the economy to build stations. Empire building is also interesting.\nIf you want to play a rags to riches game and stay fairly neutral, you want to focus on taking an open system as soon as possible peacefully, as the other empires grow fast. However pirates and the antagonst faction grow too fast in my opinion.\n\nExploration leaves much to be desired, which ties into the event/questing systems. More unique events triggered by exploring a certain number of places or finding artifacts, would really serve this game well. There is so much potential for exploration that the dev has not yet explored in the current version, scouting/exploration quests would be really nice.","March 5","true","15.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Using just your freighter to build your space empire is always a great feeling. Utilizing your enemies shipyards to create a fleet to destroy them is always fun. If you can cripple a fleet, it will take a long time for that faction to rebuild their fleet, allowing you to gobble up space.\n\nThe empire management is very tedious when you start erecting stations. You can't take over pirate controlled territories. The colony management is hidden unless you click on literally everything. Actually controlling your forces is tedious and feels wonky most of the time. I easily got my budget wrong by not putting enough money into trading, and it took forever to get a ratio I liked.\n\nI think its a great core game, especially since I dumped alot of time into X2, but it needs to be bug stomped and flesh out the user interface.\n\nThe music is incredible though...great beat to conquer the galaxy to.\n\nI love the game, but it's almost a complete rip off of X2...down to the exact names of the stations.

I take all the aspects worth noting and just discuss them without any bias or long lists of pros and cons. Now, This game is EXACTLY what ive been looking for in modern space sims, This is what so many have wanted and finally theres a game where you can start off as a merchant flying one ship, and eventually play the game like an RTS once youve built a huge empire. Your decisions you make when trading, being a pirate, building stations, it all matters, because you can become a major player on the stage and interact with the other huge factions. Were you a pirate near the federation territory? Well theyll probably declare war on your affiliated faction. The frontlines will move from sector to sector as you see actual soverign territory being claimed by the stronger of the factions. As for the economic side, Im familiar with making money and managing assets but have not had an extremely long and drawn out game to see if it has any kinks, so far, so good in that aspect. The state of the game, is moderately buggy, but its not unplayable. The occasional crashes/freezes happen, but my autosave saves the day and theres already been a number of patches out since release. I could go further in depth about this game, but ill simplify it questions. Do you like X3? Do you wish that X3's universe would actually change? Do you wish you could have an impact on politics after youve become a quintillionaire? Do you want youre grinding as a trader/mercenary/bounty hunter/etc. to mean something?

But, I get way too many crashes to recommend right now.  I love the potential.  I love starting off with nothing but a ship and eventually earning enough money to build your own empire to conquer the galaxy.  I also love that it seems fairly easy to add your own sprites if you so desire, or download and add new mods.  Great plus!\n\nAn autosave does save your game from the semi-frequent crashes though.  The crashes are just too many for me to recommend this game right now.  When that is fixed, then I'll give the thumbs up.\n\n","March 19","false","48.6"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

There is a lot of assets from Tyrian the scrolling shooter game from 1995 (I loved that game, playing till early hours of the morning and so seeing the sprites from it as playable ships was nice) Sadly that is all I have so far found positive about it\n\nThe game has been quite confusing, it is difficult to understand what each option is affecting when setting up a sandbox game. What I really want to do is start a game where each empire starts off with a basic amount of assets and funds then race against them to expand. This is just a personal preference to have and has not affected my view in order to give it a negative rating.\n\nControlling the ships is really difficult, it took me a while to figure out how to have a ship follow and protect you, I tried to find it in the ships own sub menu (because that seems like a more sensible place to have it, most of the control options on each ship are there after all.) What you have to do is select the ship you want to order then click on order ship to follow/protect in the bottom left corner of the screen and then, right click on the ship you want it to protect. This doesnt make sense because right click is what you use to fire your weapons on your own ship and twice it has fired after the order given and I have shot another empire ship and declared war *&%! .\n\nI can go through some of the other flawed aspects of the UI, however I will simply say I do not reccomend this game. Perhaps if it's menu system got an overhaul and it was given a longer tutorial other than a quick 5 min demo of controls and docking/accessing a station then I would give it a thumbs up.","February 21","false","22.3"," 6 of 18 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","6","18","0","0"

What finally caused me to give up was I bought a cruiser to be a bounty hunter, set its AI mode and home system, and it just flew around the system doing nothing.  Its state was "idling" in the assets list.  "Well, maybe I need to manually grab some bounty missions," I thought.  I did, no change.\n\nMy first 8 or so hours with this game were all like that.  How do I do this thing I want to do?  Maybe this?  I think that worked... maybe?  Can't tell.  Wait, why's it doing this now?  I do not understand what is happening.  Maybe Youtube will help.\n\nI also did the tutorial, which was helpful, but it broke at the part where you build a shipyard.  I'd tell it to build, and I'd get the construction icon box thingy, but it disappears after 2 seconds, didn't deduct the price from my account, and never built anything.  After 20 minutes failing to figure that out, I just moved on to the game and didn't have any better luck.","April 10","false","23.8"," 0 of 6 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","6","0","0"

It almost plays like a java game on addictinggames.com or something.  Basically the background scrolls behind your ship and not your ship flying over it.  Add on that you simply fly into the edges of the screen to move sectors and it feels really cheesy to me.\n\nNot saying that some won't find this game fun, but for me, defintately not worth the money.  I'll keep an eye on it and see if it gets a facelift, but as of now, it's refunded to my credit card and yet another reason I'm thankful for refunds on steam now.","February 22","false","0.3"," 10 of 29 people (34%) found this review helpful","34","10","29","0","0"
