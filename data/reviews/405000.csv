I'm glad to say, this gem of a 2d adventure they made is going to make this very easy for me! In all seriousness though, I'm Geist and I aim to be your link to promising, well-made, and seriously fun indy projects! It is my mission to make sure YOU don't miss out on hours of affordable fun by making sure that I highlight the promising games coming out all the time! So with all the introductions out of the way, ON WITH THE REVIEW!\n\nUtopia 9 was the best botched vacation I ever decided to take and I'm VERY glad I did. This challenging, upgrade fueled, mechanic inventing, gorgeous game has hours of fun wrapped up inside if you have what it takes to learn to play by the rules, which take  mere seconds to understand. I was expecting a leisurely (somewhat challenging) stroll through "top-down mayhem" that would take me a couple hours to complete and I don't think I have been so pleasantly disappointed by a game in a long time. It's tough enough to be an addicting challenge that promises to have you cursing every missed shot and cherishing every last drop of human blood you have coursing through your veins... (Don't get used to that) From baseball bats to laser guns this game also has a good selection of weapons to choose from which further enhances the rogue-like presentation.\n\nAlthough the game uses a fairly simple and familiar leveling mechanic (kill mobs, collect "pollen" which serves as XP, and eventually have enough XP to level up and select an upgrade, the game furthers it's devilish "1000 yard stare" straight into your soul by having a randomly populated group of upgrades that are available when the time comes. This means you have to be adaptable, have some foresight as to how you want to play, and careful to choose the most beneficial at the moment.\n\nThe most interesting mechanic to me about this game currently is the mob promotion mechanic that they whipped up to give this game even more original flavor. When a mob kills you (and they will) they loot your corpse and are "promoted" to a much larger and more efficient killing machine through the use of your old weapons. You then assume the role of a new fresh tourist that has to deal with or navigate around the now looming menace that is the monstrosity you just helped create and unleash upon yourself.\n\nIf you have previously enjoyed other games like Nuclear Throne and Teleglitch then this will surely be worth picking up! If you are new to the genre and want to jump I couldn't recommend it enough! Check back in here or on the discussion boards for a link to my upcoming introduction video for the game and livestreams if you want to see more!\n\n\nSCORE:\nCost: 9.3\nResponsiveness: 9.5\nSystem Requirements: 9.3\nGraphics/Art: 9.0\nAtmosphere and Theme: 9.6\nOriginality: 8.7\nReplay Ability: 9.3\nMechanics: 9.0\nMusic: 9.4\nDepth/Story: 7.5\n\n90.6 / 100\n\n*** A Note on scores: These numbers reflect an early access product and are only here to represent my experience with the game.

For an Early Access game, it's already very good.\nIf this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.\n\nWhat is happening in the game:You arrived to Utopia 9 as a tourist, but your vacation doesn't really go as planned. The world is full of enemies, explosive barrels, weapons and other deadly things. You have to progress through the environment to get off this planet to sue the agency that sent you here.\n\nPros:    Gameplay | I really like how the vacation is divided into four parts. You can choose different paths where certain types of weapons can be found. If you get killed by an enemy, he picks up your weapons. You can reclaim those weapons by getting to the same area and beating the enemy who killed you.\nWeapons | You can have one primary and one secondary weapon equipped and two stored for switching. There are a lot of weapons, and each one of them is fun to play with, in my opinion. You can find weapons in weapon crates (which weapon you get depends on the level you're currently in) and from previously mentioned enemies who killed you.\nUpgrading System | After a certain amount of gained experience points, you will have a chance to select a so-called mutation which pretty much just gives you some kind of a bonus. It can be an ability, pickup bonuses, damage blasts and a lot of other different things. You can have approximately 4 to 5 of them in every game.\nGraphics | The game is very colourful and I like how they chose different colours for different weapon types. Although the options regarding graphic quality of the game are not included, I think that this game is not as demanding as some games are so you should have problems with performance. Animations are also made pretty well.\nGame Sounds and The Soundtrack | I really love the soundtrack (you can listen to it if you watch the trailer on the game's Store page) and together with all the game sounds like weapon firing, damage taken, explosions and other things. There's really nothing they could add to it in the final release.\nProcedurally Generated Levels | Every time you start the game, levels are different from your previous round. Nemeses stay on the same level, but level shapes and weapons you can find there are different every time. This provides you with a lot higher replayability. I have to say that even after many hours of playing this game, I'm still not even a bit tired of it.\nAchievements | There are a lot of achievements in this game, which is great. In fact, acquiring every single weapon for the first time grants you an achievement! There are also some achievements for beating your nemeses, traveling to certain stages for the first time and others. I have to say that this is one of the most enjoyable achievement systems and it definitely helps the whole experience.\nLooping | I didn't know how exactly to name this paragraph, but every time you die, your corpse will be shown in later playthroughs. Your crashed spaceships on the crash site will also be stored. I know this doesn't really help the gameplay a lot, but it's a little detail I like.\nSystem Requirements | This game uses an extremely small amount of system resources, which is great if people with weaker computers want to try it out. Loading, however, probably takes a bit longer time for such computers. It's not a big deal, though.\nCons:    Playable Characters | It's far from being a real problem, but I sometimes wish there were a few different characters to play with. You currently only have one, which is fine, but multiple characters would bring a lot more diversity and would possibly require different playing techniques. They could have different stats like speed, shooting rate, melee power and others. Characters could be unlocked by beating the game. Just an idea.\nLinux Support | Well, there isn't any. The developer still has time to build it in, though,as the game is still in Early Access.\nThe final verdict:For an Early Access game, Utopia 9 is extremely well polished and since they're still planning to upgrade certain things, I'm looking forward to upcoming builds to see what more can even be done. I really like the replayability value in this game, which is mostly due to procedural generation of levels. The nemesis concept is also very interesting. It's pretty useful if you got some good weapons in your previous run, but you played really badly, so you have a chance to reclaim those weapons.\nThis game runs very smoothly and uses very few system resources, which is definitely a big plus. Graphics are also surprisingly nice-looking. The soundtrack is, as mentioned, really good and they should probably make a DLC for it.\nIf you're into indie casual shooters, definitely give this game a shot. It's one of the best Early Access games out there and I'll be definitely playing this for quite a few more hours.\n\nGreetings,\nBirdCute\n\nNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes. However, this did not affect the quality and objectivity of this review.","February 2","true","9.6"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

There's a handful of weapons and shields to loot and an upgrade tree masquerading as a series of mutations, neither of which are exactly uncommon for the genre.\nAfter clearing the arrival area of suitcase-wielding purple mutants, you'll find eight stages laid out in front of you, although due to the game utilising a branching path system, you'll only tackle four per playthrough. Be warned, this is not exactly the game that the vibrant graphics sell it as; the lack of health and ammo early on make the opening couple of stages an unforgiving experience that only gets worse if you die, as Utopia 9 dumps you back at the beginning minus your weapons and upgrades, as well as spawning a new welcome party of enemies to jump you before you've even climbed out of your ship.\nThe game gets a lot easier and more enjoyable later on once you acquire more devastating weaponry and there's a nice little quirk where the mutant that killed you gets your gear and mutations, transforming it into a hulking war beast that you must face if you pass through the area again. In this Early Access stage, there's not a massive amount of criticism I can really level at it. It works as a shooter but there needs to be a lot more to the stages than linear roads and a handful of accessible buildings for this to truly stand out.\nFull review in the video below.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f1lzedHOTs","November 17, 2015","true","1.7"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","15","24","3","0"

Ranking right up there with the newly released rogue twinsticks - Enter the Gungeon and Neon Chrome - Utopia 9 has a certian charm that makes it feel unique.  The shooting mechanics feel very solid and are quite satisfying as aliens pop with a gory purple delight.  Add in multiple firearms, melee weapons, mutations, a martian theme, and stylish graphics for the cherry on top.  I'm really diggin it so far.  Another interesting addition becomes hunting down the aliens that have killed your fellow tourists and exacting revenge.  It's tough though because not only do th e aliens use fallen tourists weapons but they also become more powerful and heavily armored with each tourist they kill.  IMO Utopia is only lacking  an endless horde mode set in an open arena.  I believe an arena mode is currently being considered by the devs so one can only hope!  A+ title.","May 8","true","9.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It features some stunning yet cute graphics and some very addictive gameplay.\n\nIt sort of reminds me of Captain Keen meets Diablo, only with ragdoll physics, sick weapons and some great sound effects. One minute you're shooting easy dudes with your pistol, the next you're hammering away at a mini-boss with some crazy laser cannon. Then you're out of ammo and have to beat it with your suitcase. There is also some interesting customisation options with the mutation system. Basically you're turning into an ammo-grabbing juggernaut.\n\nOh, and did I mention. It's very VERY challenging. You start out in a short intro-level and you think "I got this." But wait, because you don't. Somehow even with the most high-powered weapons and body armour these mutants always get me. That's why I like to stun them one by one, just to feel like I'm pawning them for a change.\n\nIf you didn't already, you will definitely want to buy this must-have gem of a game. If this is early access I can't even imagine what the full release will be like.

The shooting mechanics and controls are more like a game like Shadowgrounds than Binding of Isaac, the game I think most people think of when you say "roguelite 2d shooter".\n\nYou are a person who is going on vacation to Utopia 9. However you land to find that everyone on this paradise vacation planet has been infected with mutagenic pollen and you have to fight your way out. There are melee, projectile, energy and explosive weapons that you can pick up along the way. When you die, the enemy who killed you mutates, becomes stronger and also loots your corpse, so on your next run through you have the opportunity to exact revenge and get some of your equipment back.\n\nAs you kill enemies, you gather mutagenic pollen. Acquire enough pollen and you get a mutation, basically a level up where you get to pick an enhancement. Enemies dropping more ammo or "healing" liquor bottles and an automatic retaliation after you accumulate 10 points of damage are a few examples of mutations.\n\nAfter you get to the end of each area you go to a map screen where you choose the next area to go to. The map screen contains information about the choices including weapon types available in the area and whether an npc who has killed you (called a "known murderer") is present.\n\nFinally the devs are very active and responsive, committed to creating a game that players will enjoy. I posted a comment before I even bought the game and was responded to very quickly, with the developer going out of the way to add something to the game quickly based on my feedback. I am not saying that every request will be treated that way, just that the devs seem to be dilligent about responding to comments and eager to please even potential customers.\n\n\nIf you like 2d shooters and/or roguelite games this is yet another fine addition with its own unique take on the genre.","November 27, 2015","true","2.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The game controls well, it has an interesting concept, and it is just fun to play. The game has a strong foundation that could be a great game as the developers work on the game.\n\nThe one mechanic in the game that I am most interested about is the mechanic where enemies will loot your body whenever you die. This is interesting since it makes the enemy stronger and also lets them use the weapons that you dropped. This actually gives you an interesting decision deciding if you want to face them again in order to get back your items or if you want to go down a different path.\n\nThe biggest problem with the game right now is just a lack of content. The game could use some more weapons, locales and enemies to add a little more variety to the game. This is to be expected from an early access game though.\n\nIf the game's concept interests you and you are willing to wait as more content is added to the game I think you could really like Utopia 9.\n\nNote: I received a review copy from the developer.\n\nRead My Full Review [www.geekyhobbies.com]","November 19, 2015","true","0.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The game’s page on the Steam store did, however, did catch my attention and very eager to try this Early Access game out. Before I delve too much further I will admit ahead of time that I am very glad that I did and that I believe this is one that I’ll be returning to along its development journey and will complete once out of early access. UTOPIA 9 is a roguelike action shooter that is extremely polished for an early access game. I’m quickly becoming surprised at the quality of early access games lately. It seems that many developers have learned from the mistakes of others and many are putting genuinely gameplay ready titles up.\n\nThere was one problem that I immediately had with the game. It is not programmed to recognize the trigger buttons on the Xbox One controller. Instead, the game demands that I use the bumper buttons. This problem persists throughout attempts to configure the controller through the in game menu as it simply doesn’t recognize them at all. I much prefer to use the trigger buttons rather than the bumpers as it feels natural. This is a fairly significant annoyance in actual gameplay because these buttons are the primary attack buttons. On the plus side in regards to the controller I was a big fan of the twin stick nature of the game with the left thumbstick used to move and the right used to aim. Despite my complaint concerning the trigger buttons I have to admit that the game controls very smoothly already which I am impressed with given the game’s current state of development.\n\nIn regards to the weapons I enjoyed the range of them. You begin with a standard gun that shoots in a straight line and a suitcase looking weapon – which makes sense given that you’re supposed to be on vacation – that you can utilize to bludgeon your enemies to death. Before too long you find more weapons to add to your arsenal. You can switch among these weapons so that you always have options unless you run out of ammunition in which case you’re stuck with the suitcase. Lack of ammunition became an all too common occurrence for this trigger happy gamer thus an advantage to the game is to be ammo conscious and use it when you feel you have clean shots.\n\nArguably the best thing about UTOPIA 9 is that they’ve implemented something similar to the Nemesis System used in Middle-earth Shadow of Mordor. Whenever a mob kills you it will be promoted but it will also loot your corpse. This promoted mob becomes much larger and stronger than it previously was. From here you must restart the game and build up your character again in order to overcome the now more difficult beast. In theory this sounds harsh because you have to overcome something harder than what you originally died to and although this is true you will become better at the game because of it. Finally, in order to satiate the thirst of the techheads among us the game looks gorgeous and sounds almost as good. It is clear that Whalegun have concentrated on the entire picture when it comes to their game and that’s a good thing.\n\nWhalegun have an early access gem on their hands. I really hope that the game’s development is smooth sailing from here on out. I urge those of you who like the idea behind the game to give it an opportunity to woo you over as I can almost guarantee that you will not forget it.","January 14","true","7.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","1"

The devs have also sprinkled in some humor in there, it is a really enjoyable game and I can't wait to play it more!\n\nI will be making a Let's Play series on it so there will be some gameplay footage available soon, I will share it with Steam to make it easier for you guys to take a look :-)\n\nWHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!!!! BUY IT ALREADY!!!! LOL","February 6","true","0.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Have not played it overly long, but it is fun and I had no problems at any point.  I would say the only thing I would like to see added would be a continue feature.  I went rhough about 3-4 areas and had to take off for a bit, came back and had to start over again.  No biggie, would just be nice.  Awesome job otherwise.","January 14","true","4.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"
