"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nudae/recommended/362400/","nudae","Nukdae","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nudae/","203 products in account","I find this game very interesting, but with a few problems. When you get into a game with someone, either player can leave and come back as they choose, making it similar to email chess. The downside is that this makes it difficult to actually get into a game and finish it. You tend to lose track of the individual games when there's a list of 10 of them waiting for the other player to make their move. I personally don't like this Words With Friends/Draw Something style of gameplay as it can slow the pace of games to a crawl. The option of timed moves or a chess clock, forcing the players to stay and finish the game in a set amount of time would be a big improvement. That being said, when both players are actually staying in the game to completion, it's very, very good. The changes to regular chess that have been made here keep the feeling of playing a chess game, but on a bigger scale. The ability to control groups of pieces at once adds a layer of complexity that is extremely engaging. At the same time, having the pawns engage each other one at a time, trying to open up a path for your other units reminds me of something out of a Total War game.\n\nWhile I am recommending this game, it should be stated that there are a couple of missing features. No way to communicate with other players, and there's no way to look at replays or previous moves in-game. Also, it's possible to put your king(s) in check, which may or may not be intended. The visuals are pretty bland and could probably use an upgrade. But the biggest problem is not knowing if you're getting into a game with an active player. Still, the game is very enjoyable when it gets going.","April 30, 2015","true","9.1"," 19 of 26 people (73%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","73","19","26","4","3"

Right now the game has no AI which really sucks because most people that you play online with are not even playing. Also, it doesn't really give a tutorial for people who haven't played chess before (of which i am not one of them I've played chess all my life). Well, onto the good stuff, Regimental Chess has it where you can move multiple chess pieces at once but of course this has a problem too: you can only take an enemy piece one at a time in the game. Also, another pros to the game is that it is extremely strategic which i what i like in a game. It's about 10 times more strategic than regular chess and  you'll constantly be making strategy tactics (I don;t know about you but to me that's fun). But yeah the most major issue to the game is that there's no AI but i'm pretty sure that if the game designers want people to play they will make an AI at some point... maybe.... Well that is it sorry it was so long its just the way I am try this game out its really fun especially when you have a friend that downloads it also. Have a great day or night or whenever you decide to play this game. Peace out.","May 16, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

Still this game can be improved in a 3D way with complex geomethrics shapes where each flat surface is a regimental chess game and if you solve a sertain tier -lets say the cube one you get to do 1 move on a chessboard in the real world. :) -this idea just got patented :P Im kidding of course. I recomend this game as a inovative experiment in the area of developing classical Chess to the next level.  ;-}\n","March 9","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But looking at it for the first time... It bugged out a lot... It needs some touch-ups on how the hub and transitions go. I played for a little bit and the first game I played bugged out a bit and also The rules are confusing at first. It was fun playing. But I won easily and had no challenge. It needs bots to play against and more work on its own gameplay as well. It should also come with a tutorial scenario to keep player interest up when they join in on the game. Because what I saw with some of the players was they were a bit too clueless as to what was going on and that off-puts players as well I would rate it at about 4/10 It shows promise and I will check it out if it updates. It needs work but could possibly become at least an 8/10 or more.","May 30, 2015","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The concept makes me want to buy multiple chess sets and try to recreate it irl. However, the game itself in terms of the UI and stuff is really bad. There really needs to be a single-player mode, or at least a tutorial in the game where players can experience the basic mechanics of the game. I feel It's rather ambitious to go solely multiplayer on a free-to-play game like this because you can't guarantee there will be enough players playing it all the time. I also really dislike the e-mail style games where people can just not make a move for what seems like eternity and sometimes actually is. Definitely needs an option to have a timer for each move.\n\nI'm voting No on recommending the game but really, if it is developed to do the main things that have been requested in reviews like this it could become an eventual Yes. I'd certainly point this game out as something to watch for the future but not necessarily play right now.","May 29, 2015","false","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The basics of the game are easy to learn if one is comfortable with chess while maintaining a remarkable level of depth and, most importantly, flair.\nA fantastic, if somewhat unconventional, game.\n\n((Also, SHIFT-clicking is evil. Bouncing knights about is hilarious at first, but not the best thing to do in a critical moment. You'll see when you play the game...))","November 14, 2015","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Still this game can be improved in a 3D way with complex geomethrics shapes where each flat surface is a regimental chess game and if you solve a sertain tier -lets say the cube one you get to do 1 move on a chessboard in the real world. :) -this idea just got patented :P Im kidding of course. I recomend this game as a inovative experiment in the area of developing classical Chess to the next level.  ;-}\n","March 9","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
