You flip off the television and the first rumblings in your stomach begins..  You know it's about that time, pushing in the foot rest you stand up and head toward your kitchen.  The rumbling in your stomach gives you a swift kick in the gut just as you pass the threshold to your kitchen.  Walking to the fridge you pop open the door and peer inside..  Just like every other man in history, you stand there for much longer than you should, hoping that the longer you search the greater the chances of something you like appearing.  Like millions of men before you and millions of men after you you shut the door in disgust as nothing you like appeared.  Weighing the options in your mind you realize you're left with the prospect of eating two week old bread, a zip lock bag containing meatloaf from a month ago and some baking soda..\n\nLike the great comedies of old a tiny light bulb goes off in your mind...  bright and flashing.. the idea of hitting up your local burger place flies into your mind.  The food normally goes in one end and out the other in less than an hour but at the very least the cute girl you've been crushing on for the last year normally works the counter around this time  (not that you've gone there enough to know that information).  Maybe this time you might actually garner up the courage to say something other than.. "I'll take a number 1".  Walking casually toward your front door, you grab your yellow windbreaker, the one adorned with a green zombie.  Rethinking your decision you slowly shake your head and decide to grab the leather jacket you got last Christmas but never bothered to wear.  "Welp, now's as good a time as any."\n\nSlamming the door shut behind you, you begin to two block walk to "The Burger Shack".  Walking toward the burger shack you ignore the various screams for help around you.. pfft, "aint nobody got time for helping people besides that, they must be filming a zombie movie or something".  Finally you look across the street and see it, the burger shack, you feel a shutter in your stomach, trying to ignore it you step out into the street, making sure to look both ways.. nothing coming..  you start crossing the street...  Half way across you spy your crush, she's shambling around, her head is bleeding and you see a rather large gash in her neck!  You immediately stop in your tracks shocked at what you see.....   What you failed to notice was the Semi truck speeding down the street to avoid the large crowd of zombies following it..\n\n"Here lies  (Well YOU)...\n\nPlight of the Zombies is a fairly casual strategy/puzzle game.  This game isn't you're typical zombie game, instead of mowing down droves of mindless brain gobblers, this one see's you in the shoes of the hungry zombie.  Going about his business, eating brains, turning human's into zombies and trying to find love.. (OK the whole part about love isn't true, but if that's you're thing, I'd suggest Warm Bodies).  The game is broken down into 6 main stages, with each of those stages having 10 different puzzles to solve.   To finish the stages you need to turn all the human's into zombies, and also collect the brains, many of which are timed, if the timer run's out they disappear.   Trying to prevent you from finishing the puzzles are a slew of different enemies, unarmed human's, shotgun wielders, handgun, etc etc etc..\n\nPlight of the Zombies isn't the type of game you'll find yourself wanting to play for 10 hours a day, but it can be a nice time killer when you have an extra few minutes to kill and don't want to get into a deep game.  The early puzzles are fairly simplistic, but the further along you get, the more complex and challenging they get.  Often times you're left having to employ three, four sometimes even five zombies to complete a task.   The game is a good casual game for people to play now, then put down for a few days and pick up to play without missing a beat.  It's pretty solid in every department, the only issue I found with the game was the pathing of your zombies, it happened more times than I'd have liked to see, but occasionally my zombie would clip into an obstacle they clearly should have walked around, this would cause them to endlessly walk in place until I altered their course.\n\nThis game is recommended to anyone who enjoy's playing the anti-hero, if you would rather destroy the world rather than save it, this one is for you.  It's also for people who like fun, casual experiences that don't require hundreds of hours to learn.  It's a very pick up and play type game.  I'd say this can be enjoyed by gamer's of all ages, kids will enjoy the simplistic nature and goofy zombies, adults will enjoy the complex challenge of trying to complete the stages in the fastest time possible.  Would also be nice to see some achievements added in the near future, but certainly aren't neccesary.","March 6","true","2.1"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","14","15","2","0"

And they die alot as you need to sacrifice some of them to pass levels. Afterlife is brutal... But thanks to them, you can have at least few hours of fun playing it. Your goal is to collect as many "braainz" as you can in each level to be able to pass to another section of game, full of new rules and puzzles. If this is not enough for you, worry not! Collecting brains gives you brain bucks, with which you can buy ton of items to make your zombies even prettier! ( Harvey Hammer looks sweet with pink wings, try it ^^ ) And remember, you're helping a good cause... for zombies of course.\n\n\nAdvantages\nPleasant to eye graphics\nAtmospheric background music that fits game\nIngenious level design. It takes a while to figure out some of those later levels\nSimple overall game mechanics, what makes it more accessible for our younger players\nDisadvantages\nMovement mechanics often glitch when cursor / finger touches some of obstacles\nPrice is not harsh but still could be a little bit lower\nGets repetetive after a while\nIf you find my review helpful or funny be sure to follow Opium Pulses curator page right here for more reviewed games!","February 23","true","2.6"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","0"

I Really like the look and feel of this game, and really the pathing is the biggest downfall of this game.\n\nImagine clicking and dragging a dotted line from your zombie to it's attack point, lining everything up nicely, you get halfway through the map and realise inorder to get the last guy you must zig zag inbetween 8 obsticals placed very close together. You only have one Gaint left and two little guys, there is only the Blonde female with the faster firing 6 shot pistel. You draw your line, it seems like the pathing will be good and then your giant gets stuck on the first corner and your little guys rush out and get killed. Well crap, now you have to restart over. You get to the same point but this time you make sure the big guy doesn't get stuck and now your little guys got stuck on corner 2 and 3, Big guy went down and now the little guys are dead too. Okay restart again. You get to the same point but this time you take 3 minutes slowly drawing the line to make sure that they won't get stuck. They get stuck.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/434070/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Plight of the Zombie is a well designed puzzle game that represents the second foray onto Steam following the mixed reaction to the free to play Firefly Online Cortex which was released in January, 2015. That game was designed to be a short term solution until their much awaited Firefly Online was released. Unfortunately that game has not come out and shows no signs of being released anytime soon as there has been a significant number of delays at this point and fans of the television show have grown tired and frustrated with the developer’s efforts on that game.\n\nHowever, that is not this game – this particular focus is on Plight of the Zombie. It’s actually a pretty solid puzzle game. You need to engineer a route for your zombies around the map in order for them to eat the brains that are scattered around the screen and create new zombies by attacking the humans. Sounds easy, right? Well it is to a certain extent. Those pesky humans hunting you down will pick apart the weakness of your character and eat you for lunch if you’re not careful.\n\nThere are 60 action packed levels for you to solve and the beauty of the game lies in the fact that just as one mechanic is seemingly growing old and you complete one set of levels you get to get a new zombie to star in the next set. For example you start off with Craig who is pretty much your weak generic zombie. He’s really a tutorial mode dude. He’s there to teach you the mechanics. Then you move onto Charlie Chunker whose a big fat zombie who can take a lot of damage before he’s shot to death. His issue, however, is that he cannot fit into small spaces so in order to advance throughout some levels you’re going to have to get a Craig like zombie who can do the work that Charlie cannot.\n\nBy successfully completing levels you’re going to get zombie coins as well as brains. The brains just tell you how well you have done on a level using the gold-silver-bronze system. The coins, however, are the interesting part. There’s a zombie shop in the game where you can buy cosmetic upgrades. These just change the appearance of your zombies but I have to say that it’s a pretty sweet touch to the game.\n\nThe game functions, looks and plays as well as I would hope for. I enjoy the graphics and the cool soundtrack as well. But I am left just a little bit disappointed. Regulars will already know my stance on puzzle games and achievements. They go hand in hand. This is no exception. I’d love for the devs to truly embrace Steam. Please add achievements into your game and consider the Steam Trading Card program as well. Achievements would work wonders in this game. They’ve got the cosmetics store, etc. and thus there are a number of different layers of achievements that should be added. How about some for items purchased from the store, for equipping certain objects onto specific characters on top of those of level completion, etc. It would be a relatively quick process that would add enormous value to the game.\n\nPlight of the Zombie is an already pretty rock solid puzzle game that could be made better quite easily by simply embracing the Steam platform. I do hope that the developers give Steam users an extrinsic award for playing their game. Even without the achievements I would consider the game to be a fairly easy one to recommend for fans of puzzle games.\n\nFor similar reviews and our popular daily giveaways visit http://www.steamified.com/\nPlease feel free to join our wonderful community on Steam","March 9","true","1.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mephistox/recommended/434070/","mephistox","Mephistox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mephistox/","3916 products in account","This casual reverse tower defense game has a very cute aesthetic with simple, yet harder to master, gameplay which has the potential to entertain you for a couple hours.  Even more if you're the "hardcore" type that has the intrinsic need to complete every challenge and gather every collectible.\n\nThe whole game revolves around creating a route for your zombies to mindlessly follow to collect brains and turn every human enemy into a zombie ally, even if that means having to place them into strategically thought out suicidal situations. Different zombie types are introduced at the beginning of certain zones with different abilities to help you complete the zone. Clicking on a zombie to pause them in their tracks adds to the strategy needed to navigate the field as gun wielding humans scan and guard a predetermined area or path. If a zombie falls within their field of view, things can get deadly for the cute zombies and if it was unplanned, it means you failed to think quickly and effectively... most of the time.\n\nIt doesn't come without its own faults though. There are some basic physics interactions for certain objects that your zombie has to plow through to get to a human. This is a neat effect but this is where the minor frustrations begin. Zombies may get stuck attempting to navigate around one of these objects as they attempt to clear a path to continue on their mission. Instead they may find themselves simply kicking or pushing it continuously in front of them before they either get stuck or take a while to find a way around the object. There were also a few times where it was difficult to draw a valid path past some areas due to the size of the opening, but they were few and far between. For a game that relies heavily on this concept, it would be best to fix the zombie pathing issues to make this a solid game.\n\nThe minor frustrations can be overlooked due to the length that it takes to complete each level. They are quick and fun, so if it fails to go as planned the first few times, resetting the level is an instant click away.","March 27","true","2.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I really liked the artwork and the fact that you could earn coins to dress up your zombies. This game made me want to keep every zombie I had "alive" made me sad when I had to sacrifice some for the greater good. Love the artwork and music. The cons are that the game is short and there are only a couple of different types of zombies hopefully there will be more added soon. The zombie can get stuck along the path but once you get used to the zombies radius it isn't much of an issue.","February 25","true","4.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"
