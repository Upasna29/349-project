"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/recommended/80360/","Faudraline","Faudraline","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/","1198 products in account","The Blackwell Deception is the fourth installment of Blackwell series, and it continues to reveal more about the world beyond, alongside Rosa's possibly substantial role of guiding spirits to the next world. We have a case, a mystery and a villain. All is set to pursue the next chapter of the Legacy! The game serves as the triumphant raise of suspense for Rosa's future and a vague epilogue for Joey's ominous background. So far, this is the best game of the whole Blackwell series.\n\nFollowing the events of the Blackwell Convergence, Rosa and Joey keep doing what they do best; now in a professional context. Our little girl has business cards and all: Rosangela Blackwell, Spiritual Consultant. They do not pace the streets of New York in hopes of finding a case anymore. The case comes and finds them, alongside the trouble attached, of course. Following their recent fiasco - and a particularly unlucky trip to New Jersey - Rosa receives a phone call from an old colleague she had, - back from when she was working for The Village Eye - Jeremy Sams. Apparently, Jeremy now works for The City Post as a reporter and needs Rosa's assistance to either make or break the case he's been working on. Unbeknownst to her, Rosa shall uncover a truth so grim, nothing will ever be the same. Not for her, not for Joey... not anymore.\n\nI recall describing the previous games with certain genres in my review for the Blackwell Convergence. I'd like to keep my tradition and describe the Blackwell Deception as the season finale for your favorite TV series. It drives you to the point that you bite on your fingers, expecting for the grand climax you are about to face, then... you realize that there shall be a next season for your questions to be answered, so you are left high and dry, craving for more! The aspects of Rosa's ability, the so-far carefully shrouded past of Joey, their omnipresent yet mysterious bond, the subtext of Madeleine's intentions, the nature of our former villain, the Countess' madness, the presence of a cult tangled with supernatural forces: they are all scattered as bird crumbs for you to follow!\n\nOur already familiar characters now completed their evolution and possess full-fledged personalities. Rosa is strong, real and persistent. She takes shots, makes calls and chases leads just like old Lauren Blackwell did. As a completely differentiating factor, she never dismisses the contents of her own heart. Nothing would make Miss Blackwell a people's person, but Rosa is still a humanitarian. When someone she cares is hurt, it gets personal. Joey, on the other hand, seems more than an omnipresent source of sarcasm and displeasure now. He cares not only for Rosa, but for many others and tries to suppress the haunting voice of his own consciousness to take the next step ahead. He gets involved in Rosa's life aside from their business, more than ever.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, this game is the combination of all others so far. Combining clues interface is back - with Rosa's phone becoming handier - and puzzles get a bit more item oriented. With some attention to environment and some key words that people keep mentioning, you'll flow through the game. Dialogue puzzles are my favorites to tell the truth, making the people that they work on lively, real and deep. This is also the game that you use Joey to his full potential, more interactively alongside Rosa. Commentary and bloopers are joyful options that we anticipate now. Graphics are also at their best display possible for the given art style. The art used for the Void between worlds keeps getting more beautiful in each game, I wonder what Dave Gilbert's team will come up with for the last installment.\n\nAm I creating suspense, or not? Well, this is the whole idea. This whole game is present to create the suspense needed for the last chapter of the series. Countless mysteries are coming to explanation with only the biggest of questions persist, to prepare you to the last big step: the Blackwell Epiphany, the last installment of the remarkable Blackwell series.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","August 24, 2015","true","6.4"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","24","27","0","2"

The game runs natively in 640x480 resolution, but other than the title screen and one unused background mentioned in the commentary mode, all art is point resampled from 320x240. It shows and is such a pity, especially given that the background art used ingame is pre-rendered, so it should be a cinch to up-res it natively.\n\nAlso, the whole medium/psychic bashing was extremely heavy handed. I'm all for social commentary, but there's a fine line between this and irrational bashing and I feel this game crosses it at times. Yes, mediums are con artists. This does not mean they feast on child flesh, drink human blood for breakfast, etc, etc.\n\nSpeaking of crossing the line - Joey has been getting meaner and meaner with each game and some of his lines here are downright abusive. Not sure how to feel about that.\n\nOther than that, another improvement from previous game. Really loved the implementation of commentary mode, and it actually had some good insights into development this time instead of n-th musing about how Dave Gilbert met this or that voice artist. Being able to use phone to look up clues was amazing, since you had to travel to PC apartment to do that in previous games, killing pacing in the process.\n\nSome nice, simple puzzles - nothing akin to Donkey Cart puzzle in Discworld or Cat's Mustache from Gabriel Knight 3, everything was really logical. A few conversation puzzles as well, and few instances of needing to combine clues. Good hint system if you ever get stuck, although I still had to look some things online once or twice - though take it with a grain of salt, since I never was good with actual adventure game 'gameplay' - I play them mostly for story/conversations.\n\nPersonal 'not feeling ripped off' price point: $5","April 2, 2014","true","11.1"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

It's an old school Point and Click graphic adventure, a genre that's lacking nowadays. No need to say it far exceeded my expectations. I hadn't played a P n' C Adventure this good since the Chzo Mythos collection by Ben "Yahtzee" Croshaw. Surely there are other great recent games like the Secret of Monkey Island HD remakes, Sam & Max: The Devil's Playhouse or Hector: Badge of Carnage but they're nothing new. On the other hand, Blackwell Deception is a breeze of fresh air. If I had to describe it I'd say it is a mixture between The Secret of Monkey Island (the boat segment is clearly inspired by the Pirate LeChuck), Maniac Mansion (the supernatural part of the game), Broken Sword (the ambience) and Beneath a Steel Sky (the gadgets Rosa uses, the disco scenario).\nThe characters are well built and the side dialogues make you know them better if you give the effort. By the end of the game you will really care about what happens to the protagonists (hint on a sequel) .\nThe puzzles are inventive and well thought-out even though I would have liked to see more item combinations. The "switch character" system can become a little confusing in the not so obvious bits because you'll need to analyze the effect Rosangela and her "spiritual guide" have in each single object to figure out a solution. There's one particular puzzle where you'll need to click the same object for an indetermined amount of times until you succeed, it's kind of random so you might get stuck in that part for some minutes, but it's really nothing serious.\nThe soundtrack is excellent, the trumpet songs reminded me of Dire Straits final studio album On Every Street.\nThe game has some replay value, you will probably miss 2 achievements during the first playthrough and then you still have the commentary mode to finish.\nI got BD for about 4€ with 3 other games (AVSEQ, Oil Rush and To The Moon) so I consider it was a hell of a deal. Unfortunately I started playing the Blackwell saga from the fourth chapter so I didn't know much about characters' backgrounds/side stories but that's not the game's fault.\nI've bought The Blackwell Bundle from Steam since then. I'd recommend this saga to any Graphic Adventure enthusiast","November 27, 2013","true","7.1"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/idiobrando/recommended/80360/","idiobrando","I DIO!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/idiobrando/","517 products in account","This recommendation is for the whole series. The Blackwell series are a bunch of charming adventure games about a woman that discovers she's actually a spirit medium and with the help of her ghostly assistant is destined to help souls cross to the afterlife. What really makes the games stand out is the writing and characters. The characters are likable and develop over the course of the series, biggest example being the protagonist, Rosa, who starts off as goony social r*tard but as she eventually accepts her family's calling she becomes far more confident and outgoing.  The plots for the games make for some real solid supernatural mystery stories and they even take pages from New York City's history books and actually add some lesser known real people from the city's past into the plot. If you like adventure games definitely check these out, especially because the fifth and final game isn't too far away\n\nI also really recommend Primordia and Resonance, which the developer, Wadjet Eye, help publish. I'd make separate recommendations for them, but I own them on GOG so I can't.","July 23, 2013","true","6.9"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MakoSipper/recommended/80360/","MakoSipper","MakoSipper","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MakoSipper/","3807 products in account","Overview: Blackwell Deception is the forth installment in my favorite point-and-click adventure series in this century. The Blackwell series definitely has a special place in my heart. Deception tells the story of Rosangela Blackwell, a not-so-novice medium, and Joey, a spirit stuck with the Blackwell family, and they both go about solving mysteries in NYC and investigating cases related to ghosts who couldn't move on to the afterlife.\n\nPros:\nDespite having ghosts and all, characters are very realistic, well-developed, deep, interesting, funny, and loveable\nThe story is interesting and solving the mysteries is really fun\nThe puzzles are kept to a sober level of difficulty, but there's no handholding, either\nThe dialogues and the voice acting are really outstanding, I can't stress it enough. And this game has no problems with different volumes like its prequel.\nHas a very interesting mechanic in which you combine clues instead of just items to solve puzzles, and that works really well with the investigation theme. This feature is even improved in this game.\nOnce again, you get to control both Rosa and Joey (whose roll is even bigger now), adding a lot to the puzzles\nHaving the smartphone to do research and call makes the game flow even better than the previous games\nBeautiful, beautiful retro graphics\nBGM is awesome, probably the best so far in the series, or at least as good as Unbound\nCons:\nNo in-game way to change the resolution\nAlt+tabbing and alt+escing kinda screw the game (keyboard stops being recognized, some dialogues get cut down in a split second and you can't listen to/read them anymore), so you'll probably have to quit it and load it again to solve it\nBought on: I got it on a trade for another game key/link I had. Its full price is US$ 9,99 (R$ 16,99), and it's been as cheap as 90% off on Steam.\n\nVerdict: This game is the last game in the series I've played so far (will start Epiphany right after I finish this review). Deception is considerably better, longer, and more clever than its prequels. It's really fun and brings you back to old-school adventure games, while still bringing fresh elements to the table. If you're into classic point-and-click games, you most definitely have to try it! I had played it a few years ago and it was still fun to replay it now. Don't forget to play the other titles first! While you could play Deception as a standalone game, you'll miss a lot if you haven't played them.","January 4, 2015","true","7.5"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","1"

Bravo! I'm glad to finally be able to recommend something from this series-- just wish it didn't take 3 previous flops to get to this point.\n\nAdding more artists to the repertoire definitely paid off. The change in visual style for the 4th installment in this series is refreshing; all my previous gripes with the art (rough animation, bad perspective/pixelation, flat atmosphere) have all been fixed-- and beautifully. The art/animation in 'Deception' is tight, stylish, and consistent.\n\nThe upgrades on sound (FINALLY; a pop filter! ...and proper mixing!) are fantastic. Gameplay is more refined & intuitive; a nicely updated GUI with more preference controls has been added-- even the writing & dialogue/timing are more solid and entertaining.\n\nNewcomers, grab this one! If you're curious about the earlier games, I can only suggest buying the 4-pack Blackwell bundle if Steam offers it on sale again-- otherwise, you're better off watching a "let's play" of the the first three chapters.\n\nThere are multiple references to previous storylines that may otherwise be lost on the unfamiliar in 'Deception'-- but all in all, it stands alone as a fun & original supernatural mystery that any adventure gamer can enjoy.","November 11, 2014","true","10.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The reason being the games were both very similar in nature. As I stated before, the Blackwell Series is an interesting one and as each game progresses, the storyline becomes more and more polished, the art gets better and better, and the puzzles and clue finding get more interesting. In the fourth installment holds true to Unbound and Convergence, but its real strength comes from the best puzzles of the four games. Here are some of the pro's and con's of the game.\n\nPro's: The storyline is evolving into a rather interesting and mysterious one. Rosa and Joeys relationship is fully developed by this point and is quite hilarious. Many more puzzles than the other games and a bit more involved than just left click this object and see what Rosa/Joey will do. I also enjoyed the music and the length much more in this game from the the first two games, it was comparible to the third installment.\n\nCon's: I still hate the art. It is definitely not my style and they just keep changing it from game to game. Consistancy please! And the consistancy between the games is also a little headache. But most of the changes seem to enhance the new game and make you wish they did it with the previous games (Potential Spoilers but not too much: I loved when they allowed the swapping).\n\nI've yet to play Epiphany, but here are my scores of the games.\n\nBlackwell Legacy: 6/10\nBlackwell Unbound: 8/10\nBlackwell Convergence: 7.6/10\nBlackwell Deception: 8.2/10\n\nBlackwell Series: 7.8/10\n\nCheck out my other point and click adventure reviews on my page!","December 20, 2015","true","6.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The graphics have all been updated and improved since the last game, and still the sound and music are top notch as ever. The game does a very good job putting together all the pieces of the story to create a very engaging, emotional and exciting game. I think this game may be the best one out of the whole series so far. Also, thank the heavens that Rosa now has a cell phone with her that she can check e-mails, collect notes and search the internet from any location - instead of the past games where you always had to return home to your desktop computer to do these functions. I suppose it adds a layer of realism as time progresses from when the first games were made till now, and we did not have the luxury of having access to everything at the palm of our hands.","May 14","true","4.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's good to see some more back story in this one to reignite your intial interest in Joey's character and help round out the characters and make them seem more real. The script in this one is great for interactions between Joey and Rosa (banter, as Dave Gilbert describes in the commentary) and the introduction of a new type of threat (besides a rogue ghost) makes it tantilising to think of what the next game will contain. Great soundtrack and visuals on this one, and I do like that they brought back the 'notebook' clue management system with Rosa's phone.

This is my favorite one so far and it has the best storyline of all.\n\nYou have alot of new gadjets to play with and alot less backtracking. It is also alot longer than the other Blackwell games and has some very interesting characters.  The voice acting of the new characters are kinda meh though, I can still hear that cheap microphone noise, but their story is amazing! The puzzles are more complex than the previous ones and it's just enjoyable as usual!\n\nI really like where this series is going and I cannot wait to play the fifth to finish the story! The only real con to this serie was the resolution, which hopefully will be improved in their future games!\n\nAll the Blackwell games are worth playing for their stories, consider the series if you like point-and-clicks!

(me like)\n\nThe story is interesting, but I feel the beginning is somehow comfusing, since you're starting right away on a mission (as an intro) and then the text for the intro pops up. (After that ofc, you are free to play the game). I do believe that If you haven't played the other games, or read this, the intro can be kinda confusing. And you will/can be confused about how to do things or play thie game, since there is no tutorial.\n\nOther then that, the game has some (very) small annying parts, were you have to click _exactly_ at the subject you are suppose to click on. If not, they will tell you they can't do anything about it, and you will be misslead and guided to endless wonder on what you need to do next.\n\nBesides this the story and the "puzzles" are pretty good.

The notebook is again in use, and you can combine clues to form new ones. Joey now has the option to blow on stuff or use his tie on people/objects.\n\nLikes    More content - More cases, beefier plot, more characters, compared to before.\nInteresting story - Partly due to the breadth of the case, there's a lot more to sink your teeth into, and a lot more intrigue.\nInteresting puzzle-solving - You have to resort to some creative and amusing ways to solve certain puzzles.\nA dancing spook! - This was done so well. There's even a gif of it here for your enjoyment (just put on the music yourself), by Attilion.\nReferences to previous games - You don't need to play the previous Blackwell games to understand these, but for those who have, the subtle references were a nice nod.\nInteresting Steam achievements - Admire your collection after you're done playing. Don't look at the achievements list before as there are spoilers.\nDislikes    Inconsistent voice acting - There was this one character that wasn't voiced very well. I forget which one, but recall it being male I think. And Madeline's voice and manner of speaking are also entirely different compared to the previous episode (Convergence). Here she's way too "casual" and not regal enough. I was very disappointed by whoever voiced her here.\nMusic gets too grating - There are too many consecutive scenes with overpowering music. My ears got really tired and I longed for silence, or at least white noise. Music should be interspersed with ambiematic sound; it shouldn't be music for every single scene all the way. The audio environment in the opening case, for instance, was done very well.\nAudio can't be adjusted properly - There are 2 controls for sound: 1 for "audio" and the other for "voice". Bringing down the volume for "audio" brings down the volume for "voice" as well, so if you just want to turn down the music but leave the voice at the same volume, you can't! How pointless is that!\nLess game detail - Compared to previous episodes in the Blackwell series, this one is rather lacking in stuff like easter eggs and "extras". For instance, in previous games, if you had done in-game "Oogle" searches, you'd be able to search for characters and events from the previous games. Now, the in-game Internet search is really bare bones, and only provides you enough content to successfully complete the game. Even searching for other in-game characters yields nothing.\nWorse graphics - Must say I wasn't too impressed with the way the starting scene looked. Somehow, the graphics from previous Blackwell episodes was much better.\nLess animation - Unlike before, characters' faces no longer move when they speak.\nNo "extras"? - In previous games, you could get a password upon game completion, allowing you to access extra content like bloopers, concept art, etc. I couldn't find that anywhere here.\nSummaryQuite a must-play for Blackwell fans. There's more stuff to chew on, given the greater amount of content compared to previous episodes. This episode also marks the start of a new story (the previous having been concluded with Convergence), so things are "fresh" again. There's a decline in the quality of graphics, and I found the music too heavy on several consecutive scenes, but on the whole the experience was still enjoyable due to some creative puzzles and an interesting plot.","April 13","true","8.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I probably should have played the other 2 first before Deception but that's not too big of an issue.\n\nAs someone who has finished Unbound recently, I can see the differences (for the better) that the Developer applied into Blackwell Deception. A few small quirks were improved upon such as being able to move to the next map without having to switch to the Spirit Medium.\n\nI especially liked the format in which the cases were presented in this game. You get thrown right into a case as a 'tutorial' and then given a few more cases that all eventually converge to one larger idea. I am glad that the Developer finally decided to reveal a bit of information on our ghostly companion and did so in a way that would keep players interested.\n\nThe one thing I didn't really like was how the commentary mode had large bubbles showing up all over the screen. I realize that you can turn it off but if you are trying to go for 100% during the first time, it's a little bit unpleasant. I like listening to the commentary but I'm not fond of the bubbles (the bloopers were funny though).\n\nIt also would have been nice if some of the phone features were used more. I didn't need to read a whole lot of mail so that feature felt a bit underused.\n\nOverall the game was an even better experience than Blackwell Unbound. Finishing this title has me excited for the 2 other Blackwell games on my list. The combination of Joey and Rosangela seemed a lot smoother than with Lauren.","January 22, 2014","true","5.0"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

It had a nice story, was on the short side (~4-5 hours for my first play through), and not too difficult.  It did take me a bit longer than previous games in the series though, so it may be a little harder than previous installments. It seems like older style games I remember, where you make choices from short menus in order to advance the story. But if you miss some important points along the way, you'll have to backtrack a bit to get them before you can advance again. Luckily, the story is rather linear and it didn't look like the game could be put into an unwinnable state, so you can keep trying. And there are some achievements, so there's some replay value here to get them and perhaps see more of or a different aspect of the story. Pretty good game.

Enter Joey Mallone, a ghost and spirit guide tied to the female members of the Blackwell family. When Rosa's aunt, Lauren Blackwell, passes after being in a coma for decades, Joey is 'released' from Lauren and enters Rosa's life. Details are revealed throughout the five installments of the Blackwell series regarding the female members of the Blackwell family, how Joey came to be, what happened to Aunt Lauren to trap her in a comatose state, etc. Together, Rosa and Joey seek out and help tormented ghosts trapped in the physical world cross over to "the other side" throughout the series.\n\nIn BLACKWELL DECEPTION, this installment takes place some time after Convergence. Rosa is contacted by her former employer asking her to investigate a case for him. Rosa and Joey soon find out that he has been murdered while investigating a contact he was given by a psychic. Rosa and Joey proceed to solve two more murder cases when the unspeakable happens. Rosa is brainwashed, Joey gets trapped, and the person behind all has a ritual of 'feeding on people's energy' to remain immortal. Rosa, confused by her purpose in life, decides to track down the organization that is behind the ritualistic 'feeder of people's energy' to find something very intriguing.\nNote: DECEPTION was originally released in 2011. An updated version was released in 2013 which changed the original comic-style character portraits to a more realistic style to match the other games in the series.\n\nTo enjoy the story at it's best, the games should be played in order of creation. 1st 'LEGACY' -- 2nd 'UNBOUND' which explores the events and time that Lauren Blackwell and Joey were working together in the 1970s (while Unbound turned out, unintentionally, to be a prequel to Legacy, it should be played after Legacy to not only help enlighten the player as to what happened in the first installment, but also gives the player clues as to what is coming in future installments) -- 3rd 'CONVERGENCE' which takes place about six months after the events in Legacy -- 4th 'DECEPTION' which takes place some time after Convergence -- and 5th 'EPIPHANY', which is the final installment in the Blackwell game series.","August 18, 2013","true","18.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The backgrounds go from hand drawn pixel art to 3d renders, which makes the game look a bit dreary compared to the third game. On a positive note the walking and movement animations are still done in 2d, and improve dramatically. Movement finally looks smooth. The resolution for the UI and text are doubled, and the general feel of the game is much slicker than earlier entries.\n\nThe story continues in a similar style to earlier entries, which makes it feel formulaic. Not bad or anything, it just starts to make sense why it’s the second to last entry. You couldn’t do this for much longer without eroding the goodwill of the audience. As it is, the series is of an appropriate length.\n\nThe puzzles go for a higher level of difficulty here than earlier entries, and unfortunately I didn’t like many of them. When puzzles hit a certain level of time investment, I feel they distance me from the characters and the story. It becomes more of an abstract puzzle solving game than a story. I only felt this to a mild degree, mostly just in comparison to the first three games. I was still enjoying myself, still itching to see what happens next. But just in the distance I could hear it, the voice in my head saying “why am I doing this, what is my life, what’s the point”. You know, the things you constantly hear in your head whenever you play a MMORPG.\n\nHaving one entry be slightly weaker than the others is fine. I expected it to be the first one, not the fourth.

The graphics and audio went over a huge, huge improvement from the previous games, and the puzzles are more item oriented than before… though thankfully the clue interface is back again to make us feel like we are in a mystery game not just a run-of-the-mill point & click adventure.\n\nThough the individual cases really show us how brilliant the writing can be – and they are easily the high point of the game –, sadly the need for an overall plot has its disadvantages.\nThis disadvantage culminates in the last part, where the simple premise turns into a major supernatural conspiracy, which, no doubt, will make up the majority of the next (and possibly) final game.\n\nOverall, the technology behind the game improved a lot but sadly the storytelling is starting to slip.

Fans of the story will love to hear that a lot of loose threads from previous Blackwell games start coming together in an awesome way in this installment. "Everything is connected" indeed! The conclusion to this one is rather unexpected and leaves you with that great feeling that the story you're partaking in is every bit as good as tv or film.\n\nAs much as I have to praise the great-as-usual story in this installment, I unfortunately have to dock this one a few points in the puzzles department. In the previous Blackwell games, the solutions to puzzles have always for the most part made perfect sense, and you could arrive at the solutions very logically. Deception is the first installment in the Blackwell series where I have felt that some of the solutions to the puzzles involve doing things that you are very unlikely to think of doing... or doing things that past experience has taught you would never work (e.g. what you can and cannot do with the neck tie) or involve factoring in a piece of information that has never mattered in a Blackwell game before and so it doesn't even register as something you should pay attention to (e.g. in ONE case and ONE case only, you need to notice what time of day it appears to be based on the sun in the sky when looking at the map menu... I mean, COME ON. It's a menu, and there is ZERO precedent for that and it never comes up again.)\n\nBasically, some of the solutions in Deception rely not only on the information you've uncovered while investigating (as is usually the case in Blackwell) and instead throw in some some one-off, special case thing that adds a sort of secret hitch to uncovering the next lead. And actually, there is one puzzle in the game where you have to perform a set of actions in a particular sequence, but if you do it in the WRONG sequence on your first try, then the puzzle is completely unsolvable.... there IS a way to reset it by talking to a character at a completely different location, but you have no way of knowing that, so if it happens to you, it is extremely confusing.\n\nAnyway, I don't want to harp on about it too long. Suffice to say, I thought the puzzles were a little more flawed than usual in this installment, but still an excellent game, and the story was as good as ever.","May 3, 2015","true","5.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The low resolution is still there, with some minor improvements on the pixelated graphics, but nonetheless it might be off putting for many gamers.

The sprites in particular are (in my opinion) really not great.\nAs I say though, worth it for the story, which is decent. If you haven't played through the previous Blackwell games it's not too hard to catch up on the plot.\nWorth a try if you're a point and click fan.","July 8, 2015","true","11.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

What differs this game from games such as Monkey Island is it offers its audience a deep, compelling paranormal story, partnered with logical and casual puzzles. It features, an episodic telling of medium Rosa Blackwell and her "spirit guide" Joey Mallone. But Deception really kicks this series off with showing an over-arching plot, leaving you wanting more.\n\nTo those that may actually buy all 4 games (which I recommend, as Deception is the 4th game in the series during when this was written), I will warn that the beginning games, especially the first (Blackwell Legacy), is very low budget and quite rough. If you have enough patience and love for a small point-and-click game, I would definitely check this game out, as well as checking the developer's site at http://www.wadjeteyegames.com/.\n\nAlso, check out Gemini Rue and its amazing story-telling and expert execution.","June 7, 2012","true","11.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This provides the player with a means to selectively use it.\n- Players can piece together clues and search for information via cellphone. Innovative and useful.\n- Puzzles are unique and interesting. However, there are a couple that are too far-fetched.\n- Most of the voice acting is good.\n- The soundtrack adds a melancholy mood that fits the tone of the game. A nice touch to the game is the urban nightlife themes.\n- The tutorial level is polished, fun, and informative.\n- Developer commentary is no longer automatic. It has been replaced with commentary nodes.\n- Unlockable gag reels, sound test, and concept art.\n\nCons:\n- The overall plot and its supporting cases are uninspired and boring. The climax is notable for being both ridiculous and cheesy.\n- The cast of the game is weak with few of the characters being likeable.\n\nNeutral Points:\n- Blackwell Deception is a technical achievement within the series.

(Excluding Lauren's game because she's #1).\n\nLike the others in the series this game was a very logical progression in story from the other games and brought new mechanics, but was also different because we no longer had the villain from the previous two and the introduction of something "bigger" (potential games on the way to explore this thread?). But, just like the other games, the spiritual overtones and existential themes are most overpowering in this game and I can't say I liked that. The premise of the story, a medium helping spirits move on, is a fun one to explore and I sometimes wished the developers just stuck to that and its beautiful simplicity without complicating on the whys and hows of the phenomenon.\n\nI really enjoyed the brief look into who Joey was although I can't say I'm satisfied with what I learned... the developers wouldn't need to expound on this anymore because of what was shown which is sad, and the look into Rosa.\n\nI really dislike the new look of the game.

I have reeeeeally mixed feelings about this game. If I was thrown by the change in art quality from Legacy to Convergence (ignoring Unbound as "retro" style), then Deception was a kick off of a tall building onto a bed of spikes. I get that Wadjet Eye is a small publisher with a budget--and they've done exceptionally good work on that budget--but the style changes just within any one of the Blackwell games is at its most difficult to look past in Deception. Only part of it is the more photorealistic dialogue portraits compared to the low-res of the character sprites [and, in particular, to the carryover photos from Legacy, especially], but I had a particularly difficult time with Joey's more gaunt look in Deception, especially since he now happens to look quite a bit like an ex of mine =p But Rosa's sprite... Sorry, it barely even looks like she's supposed to be female. Her face just looks like some kind of misshapen blob, while her portrait looks gorgeous. I had the worst time managing my suspension of disbelief trying to associate the two as being the same character.\n\nOther than those art issues, Deception is a great game! The writing is top-notch, though there were a few walkthrough-worthy points just because I couldn't figure out what would trigger the appropriate dialogue option. About my only solid complaint with the writing is the "middle of a series"-ness, but I suppose that's inevitable in a series with recurring characters.

Everything has improved. You have a cell phone to do research and hold your notes, the game is much longer and has a much more serious and complex story. The pixel art is much more detailed. Combining notes in your notebook returns, which has never been something I liked, but didn't hamper my experience. In fact, the puzzles were really well done-- complex, but clever, and not so hard that I got frustrated and looked up the answers (like I tend to do on every puzzle game I ever played).\n\nAs for the characters, you can tell Joey and Rosa have been together for a while. They continue to have great chemistry, and bounce of each other really well.  You learn a lot more about Joey, which makes me really happy.

Another long night, staying up and trying to solve it. Now, I played I've played the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and now the 4th game  was amazing but  just a bit annnoyed with a few things and leaving me dissapointed in some others. Doesn't mean I didn't find great things about the game as well. First off, how Rosa looked. From the side, she looked like a kids drawing. How she was designed made it seem like not enough time was spent on her look unlike the other games. That goes for Joey as well, but just a little bit less. Joey is another thing though. In all past three games, when you were Joey, you could never leave until Rosa or Laran did. In this one, you could and that made it out of character and confusing because sometimes I would leave as Joey and forget that I left as him in that small amount of time, go somewhere new and when I got there to go talk to someone, I found that I couldn't as I was still Joey. It was annoying as well as how the commentary and bloopers were placed. I noticed that when your on the boat and you progess further on the boat, you notice new bloopers and commentary pop up. What if that happened somewhere else and you missed something, making you spend countless minutes to hours looking and making sure. I believe it was better the way it was in the last three games. There still was and is alot of great things in this game. The story line and plot was amazingly well written. With every turn and progression, you're hooked onto more the story as it is given, keeping you in your seat and wanting to know more of the story line and plot. The art work was beautiful and I still give a hand to Dave Gilbert for wanting to use actual sights in New York in his games. I don't believe they would be the same without them. The end though was the best. A warning. A warning that made me want to continue on (as  if I needed it anyway) and discover what the next game had instore for me. Following after, was the music. Beautiful work. Couldn't have done better myself (even though I don't know how to play anything). Now, as for the game and playing it. Even though it has a few faults of its own (like every other game in the world), it is still an amazing game with beautiful artwork, wonderful music, and a storyline that will have you on the edge of your seat, wanting more.

Her partner Joey will help on her investigations.\nIn Blackwell Deception, you need to find the killer that links between different people that are already dead.\n\nSo the game offers a new way of playing a point & click game, you need to use Rosa & Joey at the same time as a cooperation game to resolve puzzles. Rosa can pick objects whereas Joey can pass through locked doors but can't pick any object.\n\nFinally, great voice acting, amazing story but the game on my comp only opens in 640x480, it's really tiny if you have a widescreen and the dark environment of the game is a little annoying because of the reacts of the characters sometimes. (Always rejecting you, and in a second they become your best friend and even want to make out with you...)\n\nIt seems that the serie doesn't really keep the immersive story, I didn't play any other Blackwell but if you start from the Blackwell Unbound or Convergence it won't change a thing, you will maybe only recognize some characters that come out in another story.","March 15, 2014","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(Excluding Lauren's game because she's #1).\n\nLike the others in the series this game was a very logical progression in story from the other games and brought new mechanics, but was also different because we no longer had the villain from the previous two and the introduction of something "bigger" (potential games on the way to explore this thread?). But, just like the other games, the spiritual overtones and existential themes are most overpowering in this game and I can't say I liked that. The premise of the story, a medium helping spirits move on, is a fun one to explore and I sometimes wished the developers just stuck to that and its beautiful simplicity without complicating on the whys and hows of the phenomenon.\n\nI really enjoyed the brief look into who Joey was although I can't say I'm satisfied with what I learned... the developers wouldn't need to expound on this anymore because of what was shown which is sad, and the look into Rosa.\n\nI really dislike the new look of the game.

I have reeeeeally mixed feelings about this game. If I was thrown by the change in art quality from Legacy to Convergence (ignoring Unbound as "retro" style), then Deception was a kick off of a tall building onto a bed of spikes. I get that Wadjet Eye is a small publisher with a budget--and they've done exceptionally good work on that budget--but the style changes just within any one of the Blackwell games is at its most difficult to look past in Deception. Only part of it is the more photorealistic dialogue portraits compared to the low-res of the character sprites [and, in particular, to the carryover photos from Legacy, especially], but I had a particularly difficult time with Joey's more gaunt look in Deception, especially since he now happens to look quite a bit like an ex of mine =p But Rosa's sprite... Sorry, it barely even looks like she's supposed to be female. Her face just looks like some kind of misshapen blob, while her portrait looks gorgeous. I had the worst time managing my suspension of disbelief trying to associate the two as being the same character.\n\nOther than those art issues, Deception is a great game! The writing is top-notch, though there were a few walkthrough-worthy points just because I couldn't figure out what would trigger the appropriate dialogue option. About my only solid complaint with the writing is the "middle of a series"-ness, but I suppose that's inevitable in a series with recurring characters.

The adventures make up a much bigger story when you play all of them, so don't buy any of these without getting all of them. Make sure to check my reviews of previous Blackwell games, since I'll be making a lot of comparisons.\n\nThe Blackwell Deception is a continuation of the story, but unlike Convergence which resolved many of the plot threads, Deception is definitely setting something up to be resolved later. This game brings back the word-combining mechanic, which I disliked, and decreased use of the search feature, which I did like. The portraits are much more detailed. Too detailed, actually, since they're now a greater resolution than the rest of the game, which has a low-res, blocky charm.\n\nThis game's good, but it's not the high point of the series so far.

Her partner Joey will help on her investigations.\nIn Blackwell Deception, you need to find the killer that links between different people that are already dead.\n\nSo the game offers a new way of playing a point & click game, you need to use Rosa & Joey at the same time as a cooperation game to resolve puzzles. Rosa can pick objects whereas Joey can pass through locked doors but can't pick any object.\n\nFinally, great voice acting, amazing story but the game on my comp only opens in 640x480, it's really tiny if you have a widescreen and the dark environment of the game is a little annoying because of the reacts of the characters sometimes. (Always rejecting you, and in a second they become your best friend and even want to make out with you...)\n\nIt seems that the serie doesn't really keep the immersive story, I didn't play any other Blackwell but if you start from the Blackwell Unbound or Convergence it won't change a thing, you will maybe only recognize some characters that come out in another story.","March 15, 2014","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AnonymousZach/recommended/80360/","AnonymousZach","zrupe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AnonymousZach/","103 products in account","As a fan of the Urban Fantasy subgenre of Fantasy novels, and an avid point-and-click adventure style gamer, I have to say that this is one of the best games I've ever played. This was also the first of the series that I played. While it was the fourth of five I felt as though I was stepping into a good novel in a series as opposed to a chapter in a book. A few characters came in and were introduced as having had a history in past games, but the references were well explained and kept someone jumping in to a game they'd bought in a bundle deal from feeling lost and confused, but rather wanting to explore this history.\n\nThis game has several things going for it but the biggest selling point is the story. The story is outstanding. The characters are well crafted, witty and charming. The plot helps the player easily suspend disbelief. The dialogue all reads as natural. If this were a book I would call it a page turner. As it is, I beat the game in a single sitting. I can barely do anything in a single sitting including sitting. I was kept enraptured by the plot and story. Even when the developers quests began to feel a bit like filler until the final climax (which all games do to some extent or another, particularly those that boast hundreds of hours of gameplay) a new clue to the ultimate villainy was revealed, or some new mysterious and extenuating circumstance would pop up making the pseudo-repetitive task feel important and invigorating the story in a way that I didn't really notice until I was looking back on it.  The overall noir feel to the game and sly tributes to the hardboiled and noir era of film and literature jive perfectly with the stories. Where much modern noir feels forced, especially in some indie games, here it felt right at home and that certain brand of wit was turned against the genre at times for comedic effect.\n\nThis game is well made even though graphically it is almost always charming. The retro pixelated style is at times beautiful but more often some of the details of the background felt a bit lacking. For a small team putting out games in this series every other year, however, this is a forgivable lack and, as I said, it's focus is on the excellent story. The voice acting also leaves something to be desired, but it again doesn't really detract at all.","May 26, 2015","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Gameplay and Story get a rating scale from 1 to 10, and the AV stuff gets a rating from 1 to 5. My philosophy on this is that there are some instances in which a game may not necessarily have that much in the way of gameplay (take Amnesia for example), but the story/atmosphere/whatever it may be is reason enough to pick it up. Also, take the cumulative score with a grain of salt; it's just a numerical feeling about the game as a whole. That's part of why I do these subscores. Also, keep in mind that I'm not going off of school grade based rankings. A 5/10 denotes what I feel to be an average game. Likewise, 7/10 is a game that I think is pretty cool, and something that gets a 2/10 is near-abomination level. Pinning scores to an even further obfuscated rating scale is kinda senseless, but for the sake of my backloggery, I'll repeat again that 1.0-2.7 is a one-star game, 3.0-4.7 is a two-star game, 5.0-6.7, 7.0-8.7, and 9.0-10 are three, four, and five stars, respectively.\n\nAdditional note: This review will be shorter and will be written in respect to the first and second in the series (Blackwell Legacy and Blackwell Unbound), since this is an episodic sort of series.\n\nGameplay: This game kinda reverts to the puzzle design that I'm not so much a fan of that I've talked about in past reviews. That's not to say that they didn't make sense, but I do question the viability of some of them (for example, the key puzzle; I'd have a bit of a hard time believing that a key can fit so easily under the door). This time around, there's dialogue puzzles; a puzzle variety I'm not so much a fan of as oftentimes it comes down to running the same conversation loop over and over until you get the right answer. I didn't really feel accomplished/clever after figuring out the puzzles; I just felt like I would be done rubbing items together for a little bit. That may just be me, but I still stand by what I say in that puzzles just aren't fun in point-and-click adventure games. 6/10.\n\nStory: A bit of a disappointment coming from Convergence. I dunno; this story didn't have the same spark of intrigue that Convergence did. The first half of the game is same old, same old, but the second half does manage to catch a few embers. These few embers aren't enough to create a fire, though. 7/10.\n\nGraphics: Yup, another art style change. As I said in the Convergence review, the same artist worked on Deception and Epiphany, so once I get around to that game, I finally won't be able to talk about that aspect. They've gone for a more realistic style this time, which honestly works best for the game in my opinion. Convergence's comic style was nice and all, but a realistic style does seem like it works better. 4/5.\n\nSound: There weren't really any standout tracks in this one. The soundtrack is still quite good, but it's more of a uniform good. More emphasis was put on ambient sounds this time around. Again, the VAs have good recordings and again they did a good job with it. Even if I did want to punch a few characters in the throat because of their voices and the way they talked. But hey, if they're making me have any emotion, that's a job well done. 4/5.\n\nOverall scores are: 6/7/4/4; cumulative score of 7.0/10. If it weren't for the second half, I'd say that you don't need to play this game at all. However, the ending to the game is a not so subtle lead-in to what's probably gonna go down in the finale. I said in the last review that I probably wouldn't be able to wait the week on average I give myself between these games, but I think I will be able to do that between this and Epiphany.","June 23, 2014","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Very good storyline and game mechanics. It kept me up late at night several times because I just wanted to know how the story ended. The only bad thing I can say about it, is that the story ended after part five. But that is probably a good thing because you do not want to ruin a good story by stretching it thin.\n\nYou play this adventure with two main characters: Rosangela Blackwell and Joey Malone. Part two is kind of a prequel in which Rosangela is replaced by her Aunt Lauren Blackwell.\nRosangela and Lauren are mediums and Joey Malone is their spirit guide. Together they help the souls of dead people (ghosts) that are stuck in this world to move on. Doing so they encounter a number of persons/ghosts who play an important role in the story later on.\n\nJoey is a ghost himself so he can reach places that Rosangela cannot, but he cannot wander off too far because he is bound to Rosangela. He also cannot touch anything so he needs Rosangela for this. This poses some interesting situations in which Joey needs to get Rosangela into locked rooms/buildings.\n\nA very interesting game mechanic is that you have to cross-reference pieces of information. By cross-referencing the right information you will learn new things which will help you to further progress into the game. Some information you have to lookup on the internet (in game) and emails play an important role too in this game.\n\nThe Blackwell series consists of five separate parts:\n\n1. The Blackwell Legacy\n2. Blackwell Unbound\n3. Blackwell Convergence\n4. Blackwell Deception\n5. Blackwell Epiphany\n\nBe sure to play them in that order because it is in fact one big story divided over five parts.","February 7","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After a mediocre third instalment, episode 4 is a return to form. This is the longest one yet (about 4 hours), which gives the story room to develop more deeply. The focus is back on solving cases instead of revealing tedious lore, which is great. It feels like the puzzle design advanced a step here. In some ways it is more predictable ("find the three clues and combine them at the end" sort of thing), but it also feels more streamlined and modern. Each case has a nice cadence, and the overall pacing is on-point and compelling. Great work.","April 16","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you have made it to this game I'm sure you don't need me to recommend them anymore. If not, I do recommend starting with Blackwell Legacy; which is the first one. I rate the series 10 out of 10, you should give them a try.","April 23","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(I have not played the last game yet, however.) Everything about the design and style feels right. It is more streamlined, more visually stunning, and almost twice as long as any of the previous games. It advances the main storyline of the game, although after a long detour, and the storytelling is more action-packed and compelling than before. All of the side-characters have meaningful and complex backstories that the player can sympathize with, and the open-ended nature of your investigations (since you can complete the cases in any order you prefer) makes the game feel bigger than it actually is. Even the last act of the game is very satistfying.\n\nThe voice-acting is more professional than before, although the writing still suffers from occasionally low-quality and cheesy dialogue. The soundtrack, too, follows the high bar set by the composer across the previous three entries.\n\nOverall, there is very little to complain about, aside from the occasional adventure game clichés and frustrations. (The in-game hint system, which certainly is a requisite in any self-conscious adventure game, is mostly good, but sadly unreliable at points.) Almost everything else, from the gameplay to the story, just flows very smoothly, and is a pleasure to play though (AND a second time with the commentary track turned on.) This feels like the Blackwell game that always should have been. That said, I HIGHLY recommend playing through all the 5 Blackwell games in the order of their release.\n\nRating: 9/10","June 2","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
