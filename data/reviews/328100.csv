A very, very bad mobile-port. There is absolutely no challenge in this game. It dosent matter which blocks you move. You will always win by luck even if you try to lose! Because 90% of the enemies do 10-20 dmg on my 500 hp pool and i do about 180 dmg on their 100 hp pool with one simple move. In about 70% of the "epic fights" this happens at the first turn! So you just jump from one loading screen to next, clicking buttons - its nothing more than clicking buttons. Non-existent gameplay value.\n\nIt feels like its done for 5 year old kids. I highly recommend TO NOT BUY!\n(I can recommend "puzzle quest" if you are looking for a rpgish puzzle game.)\n\nEdit:\nAnd there is also this horrible stamina mechanic, which forces you to play an idiotic "click the buttons when the buttons flash up" game and it takes AGES to fill up the stamina bar. Stamina is clearly an mobile-device-mechanic used to limit the play time so you have to wait or spend money to go on. And there are so many other issues... cant believe it... its so far away from being polished, challenging and fun.","November 7, 2014","false","1.9"," 137 of 168 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","137","168","3","8"

The player assumes the role of a police detective whose sister mysteriously goes missing. As you investigate her disappearance you quickly find yourself pulled into quite a unique situation. You become a member, codenamed Gunspell, of a powerful Order that protects the Earth against creatures from the darkside. Yeah it sounds like the plot from one of those cheezy Saturday night SyFy channel movies but bear with me it gets better. During the course of the game, your travels will take you to a number of strange yet beautiful worlds. You'll also battle a large amount of bad guys as well as monsters of legend such as vampires, succubi, ghosts and werewolves...I actually fought a werewolf who was wielding a chainsaw...how cool is that?! Battles of course take place in puzzle format as you attempt to match 3 or more gems on the battlefield to build mana and power for your chosen armaments. There are also a number of available spells, weapons and armors to further enhance your character.\n\nGraphically this game is eyecatching. The gem battlefield looks great and is well animated. The special effects that occur when you make a match 3, cast a spell or use a weapon are vivid and look fantastic. The handrawn art of the characters, worlds and various items such as weaponry is also expertly done. Sound effects are loud and crisp just as they should be in any great match 3 game. The musical score, however, is not so memorable.\n\nI enjoyed Gunspell but there are some minor issues that need mentioning. There seems to be some gameplay unbalances where you find yourself easily defeating one enemy after another, some you will defeat after making only one move, only to get to a certain opponent and find yourself horribly outclassed and losing time after time again. Unbalances like that always infuriate me. Gunspell is definitely not the most polished game in the match 3 genre but it can be fun for a time if you're a match 3 fan. Worth a try but not for everyone.","November 7, 2015","true","5.3"," 41 of 43 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","41","43","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/raixel/recommended/328100/","raixel","raixel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/raixel/","495 products in account","TL;DR\nIn short, the plot is strange/incomprehensible, it seems to have been translated by someone with an 8th grade grasp of English, and it wasnt ported to be used w/a mouse at *all*. The graphics and music are worthwhile and nice. Get it on the Android and play it with a touchscreen, which is obviously how it was meant to be played. Youd probably pay a lot less too. Itd be a great Android game. PC, not so much, especially at the price they're asking. If you're really hard up for a Match3 *and* its at least 50% off , pick it up.\n\nEDIT: Something that annoys me the longer I play. EVERY time you switch screens theres an (admittedly only a second or so - thank god) loading screen. Want to look in your inventory? Loading screen. Meditate? Loading screen. Char sheet? Loading screen. Fight? You get the point... This is completely annoying and unneeded. Maybe the Android needed the constant loading, but this should have been one of those things that was upgraded for the PC port. Especially for $15.\n___________________________________________________________\nEver since I saw Puzzle Quest back in the day, Ive been a fan of match3 RPGs. I have yet to find one as good as the original PQ....and I'm still looking.\nThis one wouldnt be that bad, if it wasn't for some major flaws. For starters, it OBVIOUSLY was built for mobile, and there was no attempt made to port it for people who will most likely be using a mouse, at all!\n\nFor instance, it refers to "tapping" and "swiping" in the help files where it should say "clicking and "dragging". Ok, fine. Thats annoying, but its not that big of a deal.\n\nThe issue is that there was NO attempt to fix things that may not work on a mouse as easy as a touchscreen. The meditation stands out. You meditate to recover stamina, great.\n\nOk, so the way it works is theres 4 large circles on the bottom of the screen, two on the left and two on the right. Little colored balls fall down the screen, and when they hit this shining band on the lower part of the screen, you click on the circle on the bottom which matches the color. That would work great on a phone/tablet you were holding. Mouse, not so much at all. Basically, pick a side, and only click on those two corresponding balls. My mouse is set to very fast, and I couldnt go back and forth from side to side fast enough.\n\nI paid 15$ for a game where its probably 3-4$ on mobile, if that. And the devs were too damn lazy to change the mechanics to work with a mouse?? Sorry, its a pet peeve of mine. If youre going to charge those prices, dont make me think "god, I could have got this on Android, paid less and used the mechanics the game was designed for".\n\nThe graphics are awesome, the puzzles are standard match3, but the plot....\n\nOk, so it throws you right into it. Youre a cop. You go to search your sisters house. She is missing, and her house is ransacked. You are attacked, and then the basic match 3 mechanics are explained, you find a card ledaing to a "shaman store" called strong in spirit. Which turns out to be a gun store where your sister worked. You are given a "magic gun", and then all the sudden youre attacked again, some more mechanics explained (not enough!) and are on a hex grid with skeletons(loot) and weird fantasy enemies. At this point youre on your own.\n\nWha??? I even looked up to make sure this wasnt some manga or anime where this plot would make sense for someone following the series. As far as I can tell, it isnt. I have no idea what the hells is going on. My character seems uniquely unconcerned about being given a magic gun and having strange enemies attack him. Or that his sister worked in a magic gun store.\n\nThe writing is incredibly stilted, seems translated. The graphics, puzzles and music are awesome, and hopefully will override the headscratching plot and failure to even make an attempt to port the game for a mouse. Might be fun if you had one of those touchscreen laptops, but they are asking way too much. I'd go $5-$8 at the most, maybe $10, if they were going to offer sales.\n\nAs it stands at this price and with the lack of porting for mouse, I cant recommend it for the PC.","December 15, 2014","false","3.2"," 35 of 43 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","35","43","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/doomsdayforte/recommended/328100/","doomsdayforte","DF","http://steamcommunity.com/id/doomsdayforte/","936 products in account","I paid $2 for Gunspell as part of a bundle, and it took me around 28 hours to finish the game once.  This is gonna be a long one, so strap in.  CTRL+F "don't recommend" if you want to fast-forward.\n\nHave you played Puzzle Quest?  This game should come off as familiar, and I'll be mentioning it often enough.  Match-3 gameplay, taking turns with the enemy in order to be the last one standing, matching skulls to deal damage, matching gems to power up special attacks, getting EXP and money through matches...it's familiar, but Gunspell does things kinda differently.\n\nGunspell is a mobile game that was ported to Steam, and with the pricetag comes the removal of microtransactions.  You no longer can throw money at the game to get the premium currency or to restore your stamina meter.  It's not entirely free of the freemium scheme, but I'll touch on that later.\n\nI absolutely loved the setting.  The Puzzle Quest series barring PQ Galactrix is set in a medieval stasis kinda world.  You know, go fight some orcs with swords and magic, maybe meet some elves, visit castles and so on.  Gunspell is set in the modern day, and while you're not partying through London or Tokyo blasting demons in the face with guns, you're still using a mix of high fantasy and modern gear.  You can be in a suit of knight armor and have a flamethrower to fight a kobold wearing a hockey mask, or use a giant scimitar while wearing a kevlar vest to fight a dragon, and so on.\n\nI mentioned the gameplay above, but I'll mention what Gunspell does differently.  There are no character classes.  You're just one guy, and you have a number of stats that affect combat performance, but no stats to affect how much mana you get from gem matches--3 mana will always be 3 mana, for both you and enemies.  The game board is also a hex grid as opposed to square, so you can move pieces in six directions, just like PQ Galactrix.  There are only three colors of mana; red, yellow, and blue.  You still need to gather mana, but instead of powering spells, it empowers your equipment.  All gear has passive bonuses, but some can use one color of mana to cause a specific effect, like a piece of armor using 6 yellow mana to boost your damage and restore your health.  Effects aren't entirely tied to gear type, so you can honestly damage an enemy with every slot.  All without giving up your turn.\n\nThere are still regular spells too, but they work like consumable items, and the enemies don't get any of these.  There are four schools of spells between Attack, Defense, Buff, and Debuff, and for the most part, those give you an idea of what the spells will do.  These have a much wider variety of effects, most of which aren't found on equipment.  You can deal direct damage, or damage and destroy a column or change one color of gems to another or erase coins to damage the enemy's stats, among a variety of other things.  You can buy more spells at any time on the map or get them as victory spoils, but at least you can see the descriptions of everything in the shop.\n\nThe story's there, nothing really compelling.  Your sister's gone missing and you stumble upon the world of The Order and the monsters they fight against.  Quests are largely "go here" or "kill this thing" or even "get these items," but each main quest typically has some side quests.  I think there were a whole of two timed quests, so those might catch you off-guard if you activate the next main quest before quitting and one of those pop up.\n\nThe music and sound didn't really grab me.  In fact, the game was so loud that I ended up just muting it after a while.  There are only on/off toggles for both music and sound effects, no sliders.\n\nI mentioned above that there were no microtransactions.  That's true, but elements are still present.  You can't buy the premium currency (gold) but you can still pay it to do things like auto-complete quests or repair your gear or refill your stamina or whatever.  You have a small chance of getting gold after each battle and some quests reward you with gold, and you also get a "login bonus" of it every three days.\n\nThere's a stamina/energy system--you know, one of those "action X takes Y stamina, Z stamina restores every W minutes" kinda deals, often seen in many free-to-play mobile titles.  You start with a set limit that increases when you level up, and everything from fighting monsters to moving on the map screen to refreshing the store inventory takes stamina.  You can pay gold to instantly restore when you run out, or play an honestly slow minigame, or just wait.  It makes sense for those free titles since they have to incentivize players to shell out some money to keep playing, but this is a paid title.  Why is it here?\n\nEvery equippable item has a durability value.  Your gear takes damage just by bringing it into battle, instead of it taking hits from being used.  Naturally, your gear takes a bigger hit if you die wearing it.  The game at least warns you when things are almost broken, but repairing them is up to you.  You either pay a hefty sum of silver (non-premium currency) and resources, or a small fee in gold to fix it back to full.  While you get a lot of gear from fights, valid replacements for the good gear you like may not be easily-found.\n\nYou start with a limited storage for gear and a separate backpack for spells, and you have to pay gold/silver and resources to unlock new slots.  You also pay one or the other to increase your spell levels to use more spells.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing since it sorta acts like progression in other games, but you're then stuck balancing your checkbook between fixing your gear, expanding your storage for gear and spells, and increasing your spell levels on top of buying new gear and spells.  It makes your money count, but you get resources at such a slow trickle that it really feels like grinding.\n\nI had a roller coaster of a time with the difficulty.  I didn't really do well until I figured out "the trick" using spells, but at that point I was at the end of the game and steamrolling everything I met, so maybe that's how you're meant to play from the start?  Otherwise I'd lose fights against "weak" opponents because they'd simply out-heal the damage I was dealing, or they'd wind up taking off a large portion of my health each turn.  Or they'd wind up getting a bunch of extra turns while I was powerless to stop them.\n\nRNG-swinginess is something Puzzle Quest can be guilty of, but I felt it strongly here.  There are three character stats that invoke randomness in battles:  Rage which doubles dealt damage no matter its source, Block which completely nullifies one instance of damage, and Luck which gives a chance for an extra turn when making any match.  Your enemies have these stats too, of course.  Sure, the swinginess works both ways, but it just makes battles annoyingly random, unless you spam spells to make fights effortless.\n\nBut even if I liked parts of the game, I don't recommend Gunspell.  I mean, you're paying $15 for a game that tells you when you've had enough, for God's sake!  And you're paying $15 for just the first part of the game with no indication if the next part will be a free patch, DLC, or an entirely new library entry (if it ever comes).  I didn't play much of the actual free version, but this feels like they just changed how to get the premium currency and nothing else.  You still have to wade through the free-to-play nonsense to get at what's here.  If you wanna check it out, try it on mobile, but don't pay full price for this.  It'll likely be bundle fodder for years to come, so you can probably pick it up on the cheap.  But if you're looking for a match-3 RPG, I'd suggest you start elsewhere.","April 19, 2015","false","28.1"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","16","19","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/328100/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2973 products in account","Gunspell does its best to give us an experience suited for PC users, but sadly fails in doing this. Let me get one thing perfectly clear; there’s nothing wrong with the port itself, but you can clearly see that the game originates from its original platform, the mobile phone.\n\nIf you’ve ever played Puzzle Quest, or basically any match-3 game, you should exactly know what to expect. The gameplay consist of matching three or more of the same gems and where you normally score points by doing this, in Gunspell you’ll be doing damage with these gems. Or you can earn energy to execute a skill. All you have to do is match the correct gems. In this case you have gems with purple ‘hearts’ in them that will reward you with experience, silver gems that will earn you money and skulls that will damage your opponent. The other colors will be used for performing your own moves, like shooting a gun or using a shield. Nothing groundbreaking here, and it works the same way as any other match-3 game. In fact, Gunspell is pretty much a copy of Puzzle Quest and while there are subtle differences the majority plays exactly the same way.\nThe game starts off pretty easy and you’ll be completing quests without any trouble, but after a couple of hours things will pick up and opponents will then sometimes have twice your health, if not more. The difficulty then ramps up, because your enemies can do tons of damage if you’re unlucky.\nLuck plays a big factor in this game because the gems are randomly generated and you never know what you’re going to get. Of course, this also works the other around. But your skills usually aren’t powerful enough to execute more than 200-300 damage, especially in the beginning.\nQuests are generated by following the story. Playing the story usually unlocks sidequests as well, and these can all have different rewards, ranging from experience and currency to items.\nWhen you’re not battling enemies you can use the world map to get to a different destination. There are stashes, caves and portals to find. Stashes reward you with items and portals allow you to travel to other parts of the in-game world to battle even more enemies. Caves are used to gather loot and occasionally fight some more enemies. Using in-game currency you can often banish these creatures, except if that creature is part of a (side)quest, of course.\nWhich brings me to the following: as you may have already read the game originates from mobile phones and it’s obvious that the can was made as some sort of free-to-play game with the option to buy more currency and items with real life money. This version is absolutely 100% free, but you can still unlock and buy things with in-game currency. Your inventory, for both normal items and magic, is limited to one slot by default. You can unlock more slots by buying them. But this just doesn’t work in a PC version and it makes the game feel cheap and, above all, repetitive.\nAfter a couple of hours you probably don’t even feel like playing anymore, because progress is slow and you don’t want to buy every little thing you see. These things should unlock naturally, by doing and completing quests. I don’t want to perform mind-numbing tasks in order to be able to buy better gear. Quest rewards were made just for that. And while defeated enemies also drop loot these items, with the exception of a few, are most of the times worthless.\nIt’s actually painful to see a game like this appear, because it definitely has potential and to this day there are still plenty of people waiting for a next Puzzle Quest (PQII was a-ma-zing !). Just not like this. If it was made with PC in mind then a game like this could be awesome. I’m just saying.\n\nThe graphics are a bit blurry, and seem upscaled, but they’re created with plenty of detail; I was impressed by them. There are some small animations going on from time to time, but nothing big.\nThe HUD is crowded, and there’s too much going on sometimes, but overall it was designed pretty well. Same goes for the soundtrack really.\n\nGunspell could’ve been so much more, but instead it feels like a cheap attempt at making some money. I don’t think there’s a way to fix it now, it would need too much tinkering for that, but I just hope that their next game is made with more respect than this. That is, if it’s coming to PC. Because God knows we all need a new, proper Puzzle Quest game… even if it’s a carbon copy with a different theme.\n\n[Rating: 69/100]","November 16, 2014","true","6.2"," 21 of 29 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","21","29","0","0"

At least they are rebalanced to avoid annoying you as much as in the original version of the game where you had to pay real money to get rid of this nonsense. Well, at least part of them since all equipment is way too fragile. Later on you may found yourself in a situation when you need to repair something after each 5-10 enemies (equipment usually have 20-40 durability points, you have 5-6 pieces of equipment, -1 point after each battle to all equipment, have fun). The game will give you loyalty present every day as many free to play games does even though it is not free to play anymore. Additionally there are a lot of various interface issues which makes it rather frustrating to play. It's not like the interface doesn't work. It does. It just doesn't help to play or actually it standing in the way. Also, I don't understand why this game has to show a loading bar in between everything. Is it so hard to just load these 366 Mb into memory and just keep them there all the time? I can't imagine any modern PC which is not capable of handling this.\n\nBattles isn't fun. Mostly due to one hit killing most of the enemies in the game. Later on you will encounter better enemies with enough HP to survive 2-5 turns and equipped with some items which deals extra damage/effects and may even kill your character if you will deliberately avoid healing yourself. Maybe. Since chain-reactions happen way too often. Most likely you will heal yourself and kill your enemy with one of them. At the same time. Your active equipment can deal some extra damage, but I came to the conclusion that it's mostly useless since base damage is the only important. Damage from 3 skulls usually a few times higher than any of your weapons is capable of dealing. Well, if you want to have some fun and make battles a bit enjoyable then try to deliberately avoid dealing damage with skull combos and use only guns for this purpose.\n\nArt style reminds me pop sci-fi book covers. Flashy but if you look for more than a second you will notice how mediocre it is. Also, enemies and locations doesn't look like they belong to the worlds where you encounter them. It's especially easy to spot in icy worlds.\n\nBackground music doesn't worth to be mentioned. It does exist and that's all you need to know about it.","February 8, 2015","false","3.7"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

Right now, the game gets into a tedious grind at level 7, with unexplained mechanics, tedious interface (that didn't crop up until extended play), odd resource management, lack of storage slots, and way too big difference between levels, preventing me from giving it a recommended yes.\n\nAt its heart, Gunspell is a hex-grid match-3 combat (a la Puzzle Quest Galactrix) where you roam the landscape fighting random monsters and grab treasures (a la Diablo / Rogue), in a story that's reminiscent of Shadowrun with mix of modern tech and magic with fantastical creatures. You're given certain objectives, basically "go there and fight this creature" orders, and sometimes, secondary objectives for bonus EXP.\n\nYou can have up to 6 pieces of equipment, weapon left, weapon right, armor, ring, amulet, artifact.  You can have two one-handed weapon or one two-handed weapon. Many pieces of equipment can be charged with mana (by completing a match of proper color) for bonus effects upon activation. Other equipment adds passive buffs.\n\nYou can also have various scrolls of spells to do additional damage or buff and there are four schools of magic (offensive, defensive, buff, debuff) and you start in level 1 in all of them. How you combat is up to you... more weapon, or more magic?\n\nThe story is pretty simple. You were looking for your sister and found her place ransacked and busted, and her missing. You followed a clue to a certain gun shop, where you're informed that your sister is actually a member of "The Order" trying to keep demons and whatnot from entering our world, and she's missing with her partner in the underworld. A second team of two agents sent to look for them are also missing, and due to HQ ordering a lockdown, you are going in... alone. Along the way, you'll fight a lot of creatures, find a lot of loot, and discover where your sister may have ended up.\n\nThe actual world travel is on a hex grid where the grid has treasure, monster, impassable, or a cave (which can contain further treasure or monsters). There is heavy fog of war and you can only see one hex beyond your own. There are occasional merchants that you can buy things from.\n\nAll in all, sounds very Diablo-ish, yes? But the game balance seem to be off, and that's only evident after extended play.\n\nThe currency for trade in this world varies. Most loot you obtain are sold for silver, which aren't worth much. Occasionally you will discover a gold coin. You'll not likely to have more than 40 or 50 at a time at least under level 10, as you'll end up using them. But you'll have THOUSANDS of silver coins.\n\nBut there's more. You also have to accumulate blue and purple crystals, as well as tokens, for you need them for repairs, upgrades, and inventory slots. Yes, buying inventory slots.\n\nYou have inventory slot... just one. You have to pay for additional ones, and they are relatively expensive. You can pay in silver and crystals, or you can pay gold, and you need the gold for the good items in the shop.\n\nYou have a storage area, with ONE slot. You have to pay for additional ones, again, realtively expensive.\n\nItems wear down after use, and if you let the item drop to zero durability they simply vanish, no matter how expensive the item was. Yet repairs are also expensive, as it takes crystals, silver, and sometimes, tokens. Or you can pay gold...\n\nMost crystals and tokens are gathered by simply exploring, but you get them in dribbles (2 here, 3 there...) and tokens are much rarer. yet you need anywhere between 40-120 crystals to repair stuff or buy inventory slots... And I can imagine the prices going up as I get more slots. Sometimes, the crystals and tokens can be purchased at the merchants, but not always.\n\nIf you fight a creature, they generall drop equipment (armor, weapons, etc.) and scrolls, which can only be turned into silver, and only token amounts. A "fastshooter" you bought for 1000 silver can be sold for... 45 silver, for example. Your typical loot after battle is 50-100 silver.\n\nWhich brings us to weirdness with the merchants. The Order has its own shop, but availability is limited. You're shown only about 6 -10 items, some of them for your level, some of them a level above. You are NOT always presented with stuff you can use or even need, Need a new artifact to replace the one you broke? Tough luck, buddy.  Same with the merchants you found on the map, but they may have more unique stuff than the shop at the Order. You have special tokens to force refresh of available inventory, but obviously you don't want to use it all up too much. And they autorefresh every 12 hours, but chances are you'll run into a different merchant long before then.\n\nThe items can cost silver or gold, and the gold items are typicall 20-40 gold, which is why you'd want to save your gold for the good stuff (usually "legendary" or such) rather than spending them on inventory slots and such.\n\nI think I am boring you with the details, so I won't go into every niggle I have with the game, but suffice to say by level 7, the game has become an endless grind. I started feeling it in level 6 but it didn't fully manifest until level 7. I'm getting minimal EXP (50-150 per encounter) and I need like 10000 EXP to level up to 8. I ran out of crystals (probably on repairing something pretty mundane) and I'm just wandering the landscape, popping through random portals (alternate lands) to pick fights I know I can win and avoid those I can't and backtrack when needed, wearing down my equipment, which makes me go out and look for more stuff... i.e. the grind.\n\nThe game really feels as if it was originally meant as a freemium game where you *can* play without paying real $$$ for "gold", but soon feel like you **have** to . And by adding gold to regular loot drops this imbalance wasn't really addressed that well.\n\nAll in all, if you find this in a cheap bundle (like IndieGala bundle active as of 1/21/2015) go for it, but I doubt you'll finish. It's a little change of pace, but it's hardly a must-play.","January 21, 2015","false","3.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

Weapons have possible passive and active\nabilities, as well as other items you carry with you into battle, and all items\ncan be upgraded.  Resources are fairly easy to acquire, and there is a good\nbalance between acquired resources and cost of items and slots in inventory.\n\nThe game relies upon a combination of luck in the match 3, and having\nthe correct combination of gear, weapons and spells.  There is a steep spike\nin difficulty as you progress through the game, and being keenly aware of what\nspells you have to use, plus the right gear can make the difference in victory\nor defeat.  One thing that separates this from your traditional match 3 game is\nthat you take turns, so you have to think two turns ahead in which\ntiles you match,\nas your enemy can and will take advantage of any matches you set up for them.\n\nThe story is corny an unremarkable, the currency system is balanced, and\nthe game is tactically demanding.  I don't feel my time was wasted in the game,\nbut it isn't recommended for those who enjoy pure match 3; planning\nand preparation\nare needed as you progress, or you will hit a difficulty wall.

If you know in advance this happens then you can get them buy using all your resources exclusively to just get the single achievement.\n\nItems have a finite shelf life requiring repairs and therefore decent balancing of resources, at least in the early and mid game.

It's a half ♥♥♥♥♥ mobile port of Puzzle Quest clone... however, I do find it to be a bit of a guilty pleasure. The combat is ridiculously easy (though some say that the enemies do become more difficult later on), but the puzzles in their simplicity are still quite addictive.\n\nThe plot is barely there, but the world, main character and the enemies are amusingly cheesy in modern fantasy style. It gives me bit of Dresden Files vibes, and that's a big positive mark for me. There are far too few modern/urban fantasy style games, regardless of the genre.\n\nThere is some obvious legacy of the games mobile roots. Namely a limited amount of moves until you need to recharge in some way (wait real time, pay ingame gold, use meditation), and the afore mentioned gold. For me, the move limit means I tend to play in small burst, as recharging is still annoying even though the doesn't have original versions micro transactions. The gold is still too rare, as it's dependent on random drops from encounters (instead of €'s), and meditation frankly sucks on PC, as the methed was clearly designed for touchscreens.\n\nAll in all, Gunspell isn't a great, but it isn't as horrible as some reviewers make it to be. It's an amusing little puzzle game that's fun to play for a bit, but due to its nature works best as such. It's current price is somewhat high for it, however if you can find it for cheap in sale or part of abundle, I would recommend it for fans of casual and/or puzzle games.\n\n6.5/10","January 23, 2015","true","2.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

At first, the game experience was good, as I have been addictive to the 3-match/RPG hybrid genre ever since Puzzle Quest, and this game offers similar elements such as various items, spells and enemies. However, after the first 3-5 hourse, the game became pure grinding.\n\nThis game is a mobile port, with microtransactions originally, and fortunately the developer stated that they have removed the microtransactions and re-balanced the mechanism therefore. The fact is, they did the removal and the corresponding modifications, but it can be hardly called "balanced". You still get too little stamina (used for all your actions in the game) from playing the minigame and too few golden coins from defeating the enemeis (the dropping rate of one single golden coin for one single battle is basically 35%, and you need hundreds of them to buy items, upgrade equipment, and unlock item, spell and storage slots).\nThe items and spells function well and are interesting except that 95% of the items from loot or shops are craps. The item sets refering to other games (Metro, Fallout, etc.) are interesting ideas and worth collecting considering the bonus provided.\n\nMany players complain that the game was too easy. That's true. A few disagree and say that the real challange begins at around level 6. That's also true, partially. When you save enough money to buy the right weapon, the combat returns to the one-or-two-skull-matches-kill-the-enemy pattern until the appearance of dragons.\nThe battlefield, events, missions, enemies lack variation. They just stay in the same way as you see from the very first map, except changes in numeral values. Since the story is practically nothing, the game quickly become quite repetitive. The whole play through felt like the game is forcedly extended to ten times longer than it normally should be.\n\nIn summary, this game is definitely inferior to Puzzle Quest 1, but comparable to Puzzle Quest 2, and I may only recommend it to those who is very addictive to this kind of games and have 1-2 free hours to kill every day.","March 20, 2015","false","16.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

First of all how strong you are is compared to the equipment you have on and you dont really pick out your spells they are attatched to your equipment so theres no real customisation; the only spells you can chose cost cash each time you cast them which can get expensive and you cant always find them.  One thing ive noticed that happens is the computer suggests a move to you after awhile if you havent moved that will set the enemy up for sucess; ive tested it out afew times by skipping my turn and intuitively knowing what their next move will be.  I like the touch of having to repair your equipment though its WAY too expensive to do it so when your item breaks you might as well toss it to the curb.

Unfortunately, I can't recommend this one.\nIt was a hard time deciding for me between recommending it or not, because the game *is* fun - but in the end, the issues outweight the game's fun factor. At least not with the game's current price - perhaps if it was cheaper.\n\nThe issues that need to be addressed:\n- The game feels like a terrible port from its Android/Facebook versions.\n- Mouse control doesn't work properly. Sometimes you're trying to click on something and it won't work, sometimes you're trying to drag the screen and it won't work. It seems like the game has a hard time working amont simple clicks and clicking & dragging. It's specially annoying when you're trying to medidate.\n- While the Steam version of the game has no microtransactions and seems to have removed the Gold cost or wait times for some of the things in the game, it still makes the player run into a LOT of moments where Gold is needed - and acquiring Gold is hard. You can often choose to pay for something with resources or Gold, but the cost in resources is usually too high. Some items in the game can only be purchased with Gold and extra storage spaces can only be purchased with Gold too.\n- The above issue is even worse considering the fact the game is full of limitations. You need to buy extra inventory slots, extra magic slots, buying new levels for your magic types, repairing your items... And even though you don't need to wait for most things, I've gotten to the point where I started having to wait for items to be repaired (or pay Gold to skip the wait).\n- Way too many resources you need to administer besides cash and Gold. More than often, you either have a lot of resources but not enough cash, or a lot of cash but not enough resources.\n- The game's difficulty seems to float around a lot. At the beginning, it barely presented any challenge for me at all. Then it got to a point where it got too hard... Then it became too easy again. It was hard for me to have moments where the game was challenging enough without feeling it was just being cheap against the player. During most of the battles, I just found myself completely ignoring my enemies moves and just getting all the skulls or gems for my weapon I could get just so I could finish the battle as quickly as possible.\n\nAlso, as of right now, the in-game achievements for repairing items are broken - you can fix an item but it won't count for those achievements.\n\nDespite the flaws, it's a fun game - but one I can't recommend at its current price.","January 23, 2015","false","6.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's a puzzle/chance/rpj . It stimulates both sides of the brain and sometimes screws you over . A two player local dueling mode would be a cool addition . Anyways, I'm going to send an e-mail with a clip of this games page to a barback I worked with who likes puzzle games .","January 8","true","9.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Gunspell is a bit more linear, and a lot more customability. I wouldn't have minded other character choices, but the story is based on the character you are. So, that's fine.\n","November 7, 2014","true","5.3"," 24 of 53 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","24","53","0","0"

It is totally a screw up! You find much better games on Facebook or ANY OTHER SITE on the internet, without spending money for it. Games like that are normally filled with spy- and adware just to be placed for free on mobile-app-stores. Don't buy it...even if it is for less than a buck...it really is not worth the money!","March 18, 2015","false","0.2"," 0 of 6 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","6","0","0"
