It did seem this way at first, being perfectly linear and having many of the same spots as the IG. However, later in the game it came into its own with new unique paths and vastly varied challenges (likely inspired more by Geometry), and colourful visuals. I do have some individual criticisms, both good and bad:\n\n- As someone who prefers to use the keyboard, it would be nice if space could instantly respawn the block on death\n- Holding space/mouse should allow continuous jumping in my opinion, just to help the flow of the game. It feels clunky and janky otherwise.\n+ The game is just as frustrating and addicting as I would hope, with you having to learn each section after repeated plays to overcome it.\n- Relative to the above point, this means that the music resets every time you die, so you pretty much only hear the same part over and over again. It would be nice to hear more...maybe with a no-checkpoint mode?\n+/- The music is nice and metronomical, but not all too immersive or motivating.\n- The trail on the block seems tacky, in that it is always full whenever you land. It might appear better if the trails started smaller and got larger the longer you spend on a single straight without jumping.\n- on the subject of the trail, it is already present in mid-air on respawns, and if you collide with and object in mid-air and fall, which doesn't look too immersive.\n- The block doesn't change its angle on inclines/declines, so it appears to be a horizontal block sliding diagonally.\n+/- The different foreground colours and changing obstacle and platform styles are nice, but it would be cool if the background changed with them.\n+ Rolling obstacles and spikes jumping and falling is a really nice touch, and sets a nice challenge and feeling of pace\n\nHere are some specific gameplay issues that I just wanted to air:\n\n- There is a checkpoint around the mid 50,000 score point which drops you annoyingly close to an edge, so (at least when using the keyboard) it is pretty hard to instantly not fall to your death.\n- At around the 70,000 score point, there is a decline with 2 rolling balls. Most of the time both balls will fall into the pit at the edge, but sometimes the second one rolls straight across and literally makes the game...impossible :P\n\nUltimately, the game is refreshing for only being Â£2 and actually feels like how Sonic the Hedgehog should play in some circumstances. The biggest issue is that the generic sequences at the start of the game are still very difficult, and people may lose interest before getting to the more fulfilling and vibrant parts of the game later on.","May 25","true","1.9"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"
