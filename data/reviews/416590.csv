It’s hard enough to make friends in an already unfamiliar neighborhood so what is little Emily to do when she’s in this exact predicament. Perhaps, she’ll find friendship in the most unlikely “people.” With the discovery of three dolls ( well, 1 little girl doll, 1 puppet thing and a clown doll…thing) in her new house’s basement, these seemingly inanimate objects creeps their way into this little girl’s heart and they all become good buddies. It’s a happily ever after, right?\n\nRight?\n\nThen, why was Emily’s parents driven to the point where they felt the need to sequester their daughter and her pals in the basement, where they are out of sight, out of mind?\n\n“They will never take my friends away from me.” -Emily\n\nIt’s strange that Emily’s parents disappear soon afterwards.\n\nWhat? Someone ordered pizza from Emily’s house?\n\nGood luck, pizza guy.\n\n;)\n\n---\n\nGameplay\nThe game consists of surviving a of couple nights inside what seems like a recently vacated house. You play as a pizza delivery man and unfortunately you are now in the company of one little psychotic girl and her possessed dollies. Emily’s three besties chases you around the house for some reason and avoiding them becomes tedious and downright exhausting at times.\n\nWhen the clock strikes midnight, this is the time when Em’s first doll, Kiki, comes out to play. Kiki likes the attention and even if the game tells you not to look at her, you really need to keep your eye on her because she will grab and choke…I mean hug you to death if you avert your eyes away from her. She’s just full of love. When you hear her giggling, it’s best to search around for her so you know which direction she’s coming from and ready yourself for a light jog. This is important when her friendos join the fray later on.\n\nOnce the first hour is over, we are introduced to Mr. Tatters, a cute little clown that loves an audience so much that he’ll kill you if you don’t stick around. Once again, the game will warn you to “Please stay still” when Tatters is around but never believe the warnings, especially when there’s a winky face involve. Tatters want you to stand still and touch your warm, soft…pizza bread. Like Emily, listen for his laugh so you know when to stop and his disappointed groans when you didn’t run away from him.\n\nOh, did I mention Kiki is there? Just pray you don’t get a Kiki spawn at the same time you hear Tatter’s laugh.\n\nThe next hour is with Chester. Marvelous, he is not. Like the previous hours, you’ll have Chester and his other joker friends hunting you down. If you guessed that the game tells you not to run away from Chester, then you guessed right. Definitely get out of dodge. He looks like a puppet…that moves without any help. There’s nothing eventful there, really. Until you reach the next hour and have the three stooges and Emily gang up on you.\n\nThe technique is really simply. Just run around through the house, in circles and never stop running, unless you hear the clown.\n---\n\nDid ya scare me?\nThe scare factor of this game, on the scale of 1-10, I rate Emily Wants to Play a 4 out of 10. 4 being, “the game tries.”\n\nI must admit, the game genuinely creep me out at the beginning. When I saw the unmoving figure of Tatters hunched over by the corner, my “NOPE” senses were tingling. I really thought I would be giving it a higher scare factor score. The introduction of the game sets up the atmosphere really well. However, after figuring out what I should be doing to counter Emily & friends, the urge to fire up Dark Souls so that I can shove my rapier in an innocent undead soldier out of frustration swelled within me.\n\nThe creepy vibe starts to dwindle away by the 20 minute mark. All that was left were the jumpscares, unnecessarily loud ones.\n\nThe game is mostly silent and besides ambient noises like doors creaking open, it stays quiet the entire time. Doors and lights also randomly open/close occasionally, which was confusing at first but whoever is doing that just loves to troll. I think Kiki is responsible for these occurrences…or maybe it was just the wind.\n\n---\n\nGraphics and Technical Issues\nThe game isn’t the most upstanding, graphic wise, but it does its job enough. There are few graphical options to choose from but for some reason, I had a hard time selecting the resolution. The resolution sometimes changes when I (alt)(tab). Clicking my native resolution wouldn’t register. It’s happened only a few times but I thought it was worth mentioning.\n\nEmily Wants to Play crashed about 6x for me in the past 2 hours of gameplay. At one point, I couldn’t even click NG without it crashing. I am also reading in the Steam Community forums that some players are having problems launching the game. It hasn’t been addressed (not to my knowledge) but hopefully it will be in the future.\n\n---\n\nMy observations\nI had my fingers crossed that Emily Wants to Play will keep me on the edge the entire time but that’s not what happened. It got a little annoying and although I was almost terrified to proceed onwards (b/c I saw a clown and a little girl doll..thing), I’m glad I did. I knew annoyance will always triumph whatever fear I felt at the start. I love overcoming obstacles.\n\n---\n\nWrap Up\nIt’s an okay game with a sad story scattered around for the players to piece together. It’s not exactly a FNAF clone since it does have its own thing. If you have an extra 5 bucks lying around and you like quick bursts of jumpscares that will last about 30 minutes then get this game.\n\n---\n\nTL;DR\nPros:\n-The beginning sets up the atmosphere\n- Creepy at times\n- Sounds are timed well\n- Sad but interesting storyline\n- Clown doll…thing\n- Dolls in general\n\nCons:\n- Although the sense of dread was there at the beginning, it flatlines fairly quickly\n- Needless trolling when it comes to the game’s mechanics\n- Crashes\n- Some players are have difficulty launching the game\n- Clown doll…thing\n- Dolls in general\n\n---\n\nIf you stuck around me this long, and if you have the time, watch me fool around in Emily wants to play\n\nEmily Wants to Play Video","December 11, 2015","true","2.1"," 455 of 521 people (87%) found this review helpful 85 people found this review funny","87","455","521","85","35"

Once you figure out the "games" she and her friends want to play and follow their "rules" you can make it through the night with relative ease along with a big tip and a happy ending.  Here are some hints I will give to help those having trouble getting paid for the pizza delivery and satisfying Emily and her friends.\n\nSpoilers/Walkthrough Below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Paper Notes can be picked up and read both on their front and back so turn them over for hints and story lore.  A flashlight can be found in one of the rooms and is needed to finish the game. You keep it even if continuing after death.\nAudio recorders can also be listened to and will provide backstory to the game.\n\n\n2. The game is broken into 7 parts/hours. After a certain amount of ingame/real time passes the clock will chime and move into the next phase of the game. When you continue, the game will resume at the previous hour you reached.\n11PM-12AM is the intro to the game where you get to meet the dolls and explore the house.\n12AM-1AM is playing a game with Kiki (the female doll in a black dress)\n1AM-2AM is playing two games with Kiki and Mr. Tatters (clown)\n2AM-3AM is playing two games with Mr. Tatters and Chester (male doll in suit)\n3AM-4AM is playing three games with all three dolls\n4AM-5AM is playing with Emily alone\n5AM-6AM is playing with Emily and all three dolls\n\n3. During the first hour of the game, the game itself is leading you to a "secret" by opening doors towards the parent's bedroom closet. In the bedroom itself is a note that will explain how to exploit the "secret" that will lead to the basement. Without opening the secret passage, it is nearly impossible to beat the game. Find the correct wall lamp in the room to touch.\n\n4. The white board in the kitchen gives hints on how to play with each dolls, the first three hours are a lie (due to winking face) so you want to do the opposite of what it says. When you hear a particular sound cue in a room, the game is telling you that one of the dolls has entered and you must deal with him/her.  Kiki has a childish chuckle, Mr. Taters has a low sounding chuckle, and Chester has a higher pitch laugh.\n\n5. These are the games each dolls/Emily wants to play and how to deal with them.  Kiki wants to play red light/green light with you being the light post so once you hear her chuckle look for her immediately and stare at her until she vanishes. If she is not in your field of vision she will make it to the light post (you) eventually. You can also run from her into nearby rooms which she may or may not follow.  Mr. Tatters is playing the same game but in reverse roles. Once you hear his sound cue, stop all movement immediately and wait until he goes through another two sound cues with the second sounding like a sigh. Once he leaves the room you may begin moving again. Chester is playing tag and he is "it".  Once you hear his sound cue, run away into another room as fast as you can or he will tag you.  Emily wants to play hide and seek in the dark so once she shows up at 4AM, you are given a timer to find her in the house but luckily it's just the two of you. If you turn on a lightswitch, she will come after you for not playing her game correctly, so the flashlight is needed to proceed. If the timer drops to zero you lose and she will find you instead. Once you do find her and tag (touch) her, she will hide again in the house and the timer will reset. Each room has one possible  hiding spot so continue playing with her until the next hour comes and memorize the locations to save time seaching each room. If you don't find the entrance to the basement you may never get past this part since she sometimes hides down there. Also sometimes she is tricky but hiding in the same spot twice with each timer reset so check it again if you can't find her. Lastly, for the final hour Emily wants everyone to play so now you must continue to look for Emily through the house while dealing with the three dolls.  Run from Kiki (stare her down if you have the time though) and Chester but stop for Mr. Tatters.\nMake it through this and you finish the game.

Well, let us join the game, shall we?Hint: At the end of this review you will find a TL;DR and a video section.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ REVIEW]▬▬▬▬●\n"Emily Wants To Play", a horror indie title based on the Unreal Engine, was developed by Shawn Hitchcock and released by SKH Apps in December 2015. The player jumps into the role of a pizza delivery boy, who had to deliver an order. Strangly, the door stands wide open, so the pizza delivery boy walks in to get rid of the pizza and to gain his payment. The house itself appears to be empty, no sign of a living person whatsoever. Yet, entering the house could have been a great mistake for him, after the door slams shut behind his back. He is not as alone as he thought anymore and Emily and her friends are keen to play with him.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty simple: At midnight Emily's friends, three in number, begin to stalk the delivery boy. In the first hour, a doll called Kinki tries to strike terror into the heart of the player, while in the second hour a grotesque clown joins the weird game they play. In the third hour Chester, a devilish ventriloquist's doll, haunts the house and in the fourth hour Emily will show her face. For each doll the player has to act differently, to avoid the lethal purpose of them. A hint -or may it not be a hint? - will always appear on a board in the kitchen, a key to survive the horrifying hours inside the house. What sounds so easy, turns out to be very difficult to master. While in the first hour only Kinki appears, changes with the second and third hour. Two and in the end three dolls will haunt the player likewise, with three different ways to avoid them. It is not unusual that two dolls spawn at the same time, what can be very unfair if you need to stay and move not at all and a doll appears simultaneously, from which you have to run. This increases the difficulty to a new level and frustrates after the fifth death caused from this problem.\n\nA primary purpose of a horror game is, of course, to frighten its player. Lights begin to flicker, doors slam shut and the flashlight is the only companion in the dark, while the dolls turn off the lights over and over again. The fear factor works just fine at the beginning, when the doll jumps all of the sudden into the face of the delivery boy and screams like the devil. All three dolls do this likewise, just with different patterns. After a while though it gets repetitive, caused from the fact that the player gets used to the always same scream and patterns.\n\nHow do stories in horror films often begin, besides of a screaming woman running around in the woods covered in blood? Right, cursed dolls either found in the loft or the basement and the children, who play with them, turn into obsessed creatures right from hell. The same cliché is found in "Emily Wants To Play", when the family discovered a box with strange dolls inside. Clues about what could have happened in the house are told through drawings from Emily and recorded audiotapes from her mother. Sadly, the hints do not show off what happened to the family besides Emily or why the dolls act this strange. Here could have been a lot more content to keep the player interested, maybe an idea for the future updates?\n\nThe graphics are as great as expected from the Unreal Engine. Everything is very detailed and smooth, what makes discovering the few rooms worthy. Nevertheless, for a house like this, the textures are too clean. Everything looks spick and span, what does not really fit into the gruesome trip inside the house.\n\nTo expressly underline the fearful atmosphere the player just has to listen to the surrounding sounds. Every slammed shut door, laughter from the dolls and creaking makes the hair stand on end, awaiting the next spawn from a doll. Something very important to keep the atmosphere up and well made in "Emily Wants To Play".\nThe controls are working fine and include also a support for a controller. In the tried and tested way the player moves forward with the WASD keys, jumps with space, runs with shift, interacts with e and turns on/off the flashlight with either the "f" key or the left mousebutton. Nothing difficult to master and easy to memorize.\n\nAll in all, Emily Wants To Play is a great shocker for the first 10 or 20 minutes. After a while though, it gets really repetitive and annoying, especially when more than one doll spawns at the same time. The holey story is admittedly very clicheé-ridden but could be a great start for a bigger project. Unfortunately, Emily Wants To Play is not worth a replay and due to the reason of difficulty hard to even finish.\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ RÉSUMÉ]▬▬▬▬●\nI have to admit that this game frighten me in the first 15 minutes. The japanese-like doll Kiki and the ventriloquist's doll Chester always scared the hell out of me, when I had not the knowledge how to avoid these creepy dolls. As soon as I found out the patterns, they just started to get annoying. In the third hour all three are spawning, often two at the time. As I wrote in my review, you can avoid them by acting different against each doll, but when two patterns don't fit together - like staying silent and staring at one and run from the other - the end is quite clear, game over. Also, I wish the story on the tapes would not have stopped so sudden.\n\nHardcorelovers of games like "Five Nights At Freddies" and "Slenderman" will find their joy in this game, everyone else should either wait for a sale or even skip this game.\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ TL;DR]▬▬▬▬●\n[✔] Detailed and smooth graphics, tensing surrounding sound\n[✔] Great gameplay idea\n[✔] Horrifying at the beginning\n[✔] Three dolls with three different scarepatterns\n\n[✖] House incl. basement looks too clean\n[✖] Repetitive gameplay and boring jumpscares\n[✖] Abrupt ending of a very unclear story\n[✖] Very difficult to finish caused from double-spawning dolls\n[✖] No replay value\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ MEDIA]▬▬▬▬▬●\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEwZFQRl-Aw\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=639373872\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you liked this review and want to see more from me, give this review a thumbs up!

Lord knows I've played enough horror games to have already learned how treacherous THEY can be.  But thanks to Emily Wants to Play, I can safely add PIZZA DELIVERY GUYS to my list of creepy, untrustworthy phenomena.  Because apparently it's normal practice for them to go up to the door of a house they're delivering food to, invite themselves THROUGH said door if no one answers, then proceed to walk through every room in the house ostensibly "looking" for someone, even though their attempts to call out for another human being have thus far met with no reply whatsoever.\n\nWhoops...did I say EVERY ROOM?  I meant as many rooms as they're able to traverse before suddenly, inexplicably, and completely without warning getting a jump scare and a return to the Menu screen.\n\nI do appreciate that two of the most influential horror games of recent years have been Amnesia: The Dark Descent and Five Nights at Freddy's.  Emily Wants to Play clearly takes influence from both of these, and places events in a suburban house setting which, as best as I can tell, only has about ten rooms and a corridor or two in it.  I'm especially seeing a lot of comparisons to FNAF in other reviews - big surprise there, given all the fourteen year-olds who think that it's the first horror game ever made - but there's two things which FNAF can boast about having which this game most definitely CAN NOT:  A story, and clear instructions.  Simply put, you're a better mother-♥♥♥♥er than me if you can actually work out what the game wants you to do, and what you have to do in order to survive more than one or two minutes past midnight.\n\nNow, I'm quite, quite sure that we can all rely on the indiscriminating fanboys and fangirls to build upon the "mythology" which is, at best, in its barest of bones in the actual GAME, and I look forward to all the comments below telling me how stupid I am, 'cause "Dont u know that when such-and-such a doll is active u have to do this, this & this in order to stay alive, are you stoopid or sumthin cos its on all the forums and us good playerz know how to do it and I can speedrun the whole game in twelve minitz and ur a dumbass kunt and why dont u lern to READ u stupid kunt..."\n\nHey, you know why I don't read forums to work out how to play games?  'Cause I expect the games themselves to give me SOME VAGUE HINTS as to what I'm supposed to be doing, like, WITHIN THE GAME SOMEWHERE.  Preferably somewhere near the beginning, and with a bit of a learning curve (not just cheap, instant death in the first ten minutes).  Emily may well want to play, but she'll have to tell me WHICH GAME she wants to play first!  Am I playing hide-and-go-seek, where I'm supposed to be LOOKING for someone or something?  Or am I the one who should be hiding, in which case, WHY CAN'T I?  I understand that Outlast wanted me to hide in lockers and under beds...'CAUSE IT TOLD ME SO.\n\nListen up, all you new, rebellious, "cutting-edge" horror devs...something isn't clever and enigmatic just because it's incomprehensible.  That's the "look everyone, I ♥♥♥♥ in a jar and now it's on display at the Louvre" approach to modern "art", in other words.  It's the same as the lyricist who writes a whole truckload of wank and says stuff like, "Well, I don't know what I meant when I wrote it, it's up to the LISTENER to decide for themselves."  Well, you know what?  I'm a little tired, as a gamer, of having to try and work out what games want me to do.  I'm not saying I need my hand held - I'm perfectly happy with games which tell you the bare minimum, and force you to LOGICALLY work things out from there - but THERE'S NOTHING LOGICAL GOING ON HERE!  Why doesn't my pizza guy just leave via the front door?  Or try and jump out a window, failing that?  Or failing even THAT, how about screaming out for help from the neighbours or just shutting himself in a cupboard and crying himself to sleep?  Why does he explore the house FOR NO APPARENT REASON?!  Are all pizza guys really that brave and/or stupid?!?  Aaaaaaarrrrrgggghhhhhh!!!\n\nNow for the part where I justify giving this a thumbs-up, when I'm essentially arguing that this game is nigh-on unplayable to all bar the faithful with far too much time on their hands (or only two games in their library, 'cause their Mums don't give them that much pocket money to throw around).  Firstly, this game IS scary.  Shawn Hitchcock, despite having learned absolutely nothing from his late, great-great uncle about how to create suspense through STORY, does have some mastery of how to create an atmosphere.  Which is always impressive, I believe, when said atmosphere is completely devoid of any CONTEXT.  But the visuals and sound ARE, for the most part, pretty effective, I'll certainly cop to that.\n\nSecondly, as many a reviewer (including myself) has whinged about in the past, there's no "neutral" button in Steam reviews.  It's a thumb-up or a thumb-down, and not only is this game not anything even approximating TECHNICALLY incompetent, but there is apparently - glancing at the forums - a whole cavalcade of people who've managed to get much, much further into the game than I have, so clearly it can be done.  My problem is that I HONESTLY COULD NOT BE ♥♥♥♥ED, when the dev could similarly not be ♥♥♥♥ed trying to give ANY motivation, whatsoever, for my character to do, well, basically ANYTHING.\n\nI mean, it's "not rocket science", let's face it.  Outlast...♥♥♥♥, some big crazy ♥♥♥♥er threw me down to a lower floor in this whacked-out asylum (which I entered because I'm a journalist looking for a juicy story), and now I can't leave the way I came in.  BUT I AM TRYING TO FIND ANOTHER WAY OUT.   That's the first thing they'll tell you in Drama school...your character needs an OBJECTIVE.  Alien: Isolation...♥♥♥♥, I've crash-landed on this space station where an alien organism is killing everyone, I NEED TO GET OFF THIS SPACE STATION.  ASAP.  Emily Wants to Play...hey, I'm just here to deliver pizza, no one answered the door, may as well have a wander around.  Hey, creepy dolls and laughter and ♥♥♥♥, I think I'll stay and explore some more.  Hey, that's really interesting, some strange spooky girl is spider-crawling her way quickly across the floor, I think I might go and say hello...OH ♥♥♥♥, WHERE DID THAT COME FROM?!  DEAD.\n\nSo who's the thumb-up for?  Ninety-five per cent of people who play horror games, apparently...you know, people who write reviews much shorter than this tiresomely long one and just say something about how it was "really spoopy, 11/10, would poop pants again".  In all honesty, it IS a great game, if you just wanna make a fifteen minute Youtube video to show off your best PewDiePie impersonation.  For the 5% of us horror gamers who actually require a bit of story and/or context, it's worth a buck or two at best, on sale, and even then just out of passing curiosity.\n\nEmily Wants to Play is a long, long, LONG way from the worst horror game on Steam, but it's also quite some way off being the best.  The dev might even be one worth keeping an eye out for, should he ever decide to take a proper lesson from the FNAF games and actually EXPLAIN to the player what they're supposed to be doing, and more importantly, WHY.  We horror fans really, REALLY don't expect a whole lot of story and/or logic from our horror games, but the vaguest semblance of either never goes astray.\n\nVerdict: 6/10.","December 12, 2015","true","1.2"," 61 of 83 people (73%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","73","61","83","27","4"

I died, but Isn't it winning if you find her? Vacated bowels.\nIn hindsight a game that takes 10 minutes to "win?" might not be worth $5. Get this game on sale for $1. I think there's about 10 rooms, 3 radios, 2 recordings, 2 creepy dolls, one clown, and 1 Emily. Thats about all the content of this game. Don't get me wrong, what this game does, it does VERY WELL... Standing at the front door and not moving WILL NOT SAVE YOU... Just wait until the clock strikes 12... They are ALL out to get you.\n\nEDIT: The clown is cheap imo. The girl/guy manniquin dolls stop when you look at them. Then you turn away, they get closer, look at them again they stop. This works. This is a good gameplay mechanic. The clown "gets" you whether you look at him, runaway, or anything. This is cheap imo. If you fix the clown to the rules of the other entities, this would be a great game.\n\nEDIT #2: This game is scary as f... Until the 1 hour mark. You die so often, it goes from terror to annoyance. You're not given time to amply explore without dying. Now this might be on purpose since the game is small, but it's still a negative.\n\nDO NOT PLAY THIS GAME if:\n1. You are scared of the dark... She turns out the lights.\n2. You hate clowns.\n3. You hate dolls.\n4. You hate scary sounds.\n5. You're claustrophobic or cleithrophobic or have anxiety.\n\nDO Play this game if you like your heart to stop.\n\n10/10 creepiness/scariness, 5/10 gameplay/value.\n\nSo apparently the clown is supposed to not get you if you stand still. This works MOST of the time. He's in hour 2. If you face the other 2 mannequin Americans they won't get you. But pay attention to creaking doors to know where they are coming from. Survive the night. Until 6 AM I think, and you "win" the game.","December 10, 2015","true","4.6"," 93 of 142 people (65%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","65","93","142","29","9"

I thought it was perhaps due to my play style as spoilered below, but I tried other methods and no, it wasn't. I don't mind if I mess up and have to start again, but losing because it's impossible to hide from the enemies because of the actual game mechanics is exceptionally frustrating, and it makes the game become very repetative very quickly, not that there's a lot of variation to begin with.\n\nThe clock noise loading screen is also incredibly loud and annoying, especially after I realized that it was one of the maybe 6 or 7 sounds in the game. Don't know how I missed the lack of background noise, but there's nothing, which makes it kind of dull. You hear your own footsteps and doors closing but that's it.\n\nhow to play:\n\nfind the three or four story collectable things then stand in a corner with a door to your left and a door to your right\n\nthat’s it\n\nthat’s all\n\nthe girl laughed? turn around\n\nthe clown made clown noises? take your hands off the keyboard\n\nthe puppet made whatever the ♥♥♥♥ that noise was supposed to be? go through one of the doors and then find another corner\n\nit works well until the clown and the puppet spawn really close together because in order to not die from the puppet you have to move but if you do that the clown kills you. Actually though, I think my favourite moment of the game was the first time that happened because it did a glitch where they jumpscared at the same time and the game freaked out cause it didn’t know how to handle that\n\nIf there were more collectables providing more of a story, I might have gone with a thumbs up. Like, what's going on? There were a few tidbits that really could have been expanded on. Oh well. The few collectables in the game actually made the lack of story more of an issue to me, because it felt like there was meant to be a story, but it never made it into the game. That, or they just tried to spoop up the atmosphere with a few scribbles, I guess.\n\ntldr; really repetative, very small area to "roam" (a basement is mentioned in a collectable but there's no basement to go to, so... thanks?), unfair spawning that occurs far too often, no story other than a few tidbits which made it seem like there was meant to be a story but it got dropped, and super annoying sound effects.\n\noh, and it also reset the resolution to 1600x1200 every time i died so that was a treat to change it back every single time","December 23, 2015","false","1.2"," 104 of 162 people (64%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","64","104","162","28","6"

I always thought that for a game made by 1 guy, the models actually look pretty nice.\n\n+ Due to the random nature of the game, this game has some replayability, especially doing 5 am over and over again.\n\n+ The game is fairly simple to grasp. It didn't take long for me to find out what each monster does and how to get rid of them\n\n+ As far as the jumpscares, They are all unique and did get me quite a few times. They even use different sounds!\n\n+ The game is actually difficult (especially in the later levels) Which is good because if it was easy, I bet it would of gotten boring fast.\n\n+ The flashlight in this game isn't a complete joke.\n\n- As far as the scare factor goes, I personally didn't find this game that scary. The only thing that really scares me is chester. I personally dont mind because the gameplay is good\n\n- The story is kinda lackluster. I didn't really find myself getting engaged with it like FNaF for example.\n\n- Whenever you die, you have to restart back at the main menu instead of there being a retry button. Kind of a nitpick, but it kind of ruins the flow of the gameplay when I want to skip the main menu/clock animation.\n\n- I kind of wish there was more. But I guess that is a good complaint to have.\n\nOVERALL: Emily wants to play is a fantastic game for horror and non horror fans alike. I feel like its creepy enough to get into, but fun enough to want you to keep playing. I just hope there is a sequal at some point, and thanks to Shawn Hitchcock for making such a fantastic game. Even if there isn't a sequal, I hope whatever you work on in the future is just as good.","January 10","true","3.0"," 39 of 52 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","39","52","0","1"

As you can see, I haven't played it very much, because it scared the poo out of me!\n\nMost of the derogatory comments I see are 'it's Pewdie-bait' or 'just cheap jump scares' or 'graphics suck'.  And I can give you that last one, the graphics are not cutting edge, it's very much an indie-style game and it shows, lacking a lot of the polish a AAA title would have.\n\nProbably why it's only $5 and not $60.\n\nYes, it has jump scares, but I find them to be very well done.  The first time I crept through the house and saw dummies moving when I looked away, or lights turn out as soon as I left a room, or some little girl-beast crawling behind some furniture causing me to immediately turn around and leave the room and close the door, it scared the crap out of me.  And those aren't 'jump scares'.  That is building atmosphere.  I felt tense, on edge, creepy... and I hadn't even reached the part of the game where the things attack me, yet.  Might be because I play in the dark with my back to an empty room like a pro.\n\nI got so scared I exited the game before anything actually happened to me, and I'm terrified to try again.  This is EXACTLY what a horror game is supposed to do: scare your pants off.  It's not 'just jump scares'.  If you're an Internet Tough Guy or just hard to scare, if things like The Grudge and The Ring don't freak you out, you probably won't be scared by this game.\n\nGameplay is pretty simple, you can look around, move, and right-click to activate stuff.  As the night wears on, different 'levels' of murder-dolls come at you, and each is defeated by differing methods you're left to discover these on your own.  There's a few hints lying around the game world, but mostly you're left to try it yourself.  It's not a long game, it's probably not even that difficult, but for only five bucks?  It definitely delivers on the creepy for that.\n\nIf you're expecting a polished, exquisite product with great graphics and 10+ hours of gameplay and lots of replayability for five dollars, well... you're kind of silly.  Or spoiled.\n\nFor the price, this game gives you exactly what it promises.  So it gets my first ever thumbs up review.","December 19, 2015","true","0.1"," 46 of 66 people (70%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","70","46","66","5","0"

Items which explain what happened are few and far between. Since the back story is communicated in those same items you examine around the house, you will quickly find everything, and will be left with just evading the monsters for the rest of the game.\n\nVery limited settings: Widescreen only options, and no ability to invert mouse vertically.\n\nLater sections will throw you completely at the mercy of the randomly generated monster placements.

But for this game and others such as Five Nights at Freddy's, it's really not  THAT  reductive. A lot of what makes this game scary depends on how easily scared you are. A lot of this game is incredibly reliant on jumpscares, which, for better or worse, is where a lot of horror games seem to be.\n\nEmily Wants to Play isn't that different in that regard.\n\nEmily sure does want to play, but man oh man, she won't be telling you any of the rules.\n\nGo into the basement before you find the secret enterance? She'll kill you.\nTry to pick up the knife to defend yourself at a certain point? She'll kill you.\n\nPROTIP:  The whiteboard in the kitchen lies to you. Do the exact OPPOSITE of whatever it says.\n\n\nTL:DR: Kinda samey with other horror games that have come out in recent years, the atmosphere is pretty good though. $4.99 is the absolute threshold I have for games like this, and you shouldn't pay any more for this. If you can get it at a price drop during a sale, sure, go for it.\n\nI give it a 7/10.","March 12","true","1.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

The lack of ANY instruction other than controls, random spawning items, and the voice acting. It relies on jumpscares in a very cheesy way. You have NO idea what to do and it will take you longer to learn how to play this game than it will take you to refund it. There is little direction, the story sucks, the graphics aren't that great yet demand a lot?\n\nThis game is a mess.

Review may contain spoilers. You have been warned.\n\nFirst of, the game isn't necessarly bad, but the game is pretty terrible based on my own preferences.\n\nPros:\n\n- Creepy at first\n- Freedom to explore\n\nCons:\n\n- Small map\n- Obvious scares\n- Ridiciously difficult to survive (for me anyway)\n- Cliché and uninspired story-line\n- Very basic level design\n\n\nThis is what happened when I played:\n\nI enter the house and start exploring. I see a few scares here and there, most of them obvious onces, like a stalking doll, or a doll that gave me a jumpscare when I walked up to it. Scares every horror gamer out there have seen a thousand times before.\n\nI read a couple of notes from, what I guess is Emily. She feels like her parents never loved her and now she is haunting the house. I listen to a couple of cassettes from her mother that apparently delt with psychological problems, basic horror story settings. Nothing very intresting.\n\nThen, the clock tics and I notice it's midnight. From nowhere, a doll jumps at my screen and kills me. Game over...\n\nI restart from latest checkpoint and decide to move away from the killer doll. Apparently, she followed me and killed me again. Game over.\n\nI restart from the latest checkpoint again, knowing how to deal with the doll this time, or so I thought. The doll only moved when I wasn't looking, so I was constantly looking her way to assure she wouldn't kill me again. I entered a room and closed the door. Apparently, she could teleport past the door and killed me yet again. Game over.\n\nI restarted from last checkpoint again. This time, I decided to pretty much run around so that ♥♥♥♥♥ wouldn't catch me. I ran into a room I had not yet been in. A second doll appeared out of nowhere and killed me instead. This time I gave up and turned off the game.\n\nI died 5 times in less than 10 minutes.\n\n\nMaybe I'm doing something wrong, maybe I gave up too easily, I don't know, but this game was just too frustrating for me. Even without the annoying dolls all around me, the game wasn't intresting. It's way too cliché and offers nothing new to the table, at all. Level design is basic, story is unoriginal, scares are way too overused.\n\n2/10 - Would rage quit again.","December 29, 2015","false","0.2"," 17 of 28 people (61%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","61","17","28","4","0"

The FPS isn't really the problem, Its The Fact that i cannot play the game like i wanted to. Mostly because of how the game runs, If you run it in windowed mode, Its gonna crash and not save your progress, Run it in fullscreen, Let me tell you... you finna smash your computer. In Fullscreen the FPS is HORRIBLE, And unstable gameplay. There's this black bar at the top, which is getting on my nerves. IDK if its my computer or the game, Maybe its my computer. If you set your settings to "High" Don't bother playing the game when a jumpscare happens...\n\nOther Then Those problems, This is a awesome game and i'm looking forward to seeing it grow. :)\n\n--- Если вы хотите игру, которая на самом деле хорошо, и игра, которая даже не открыты.

Главным образом, потому , как игра работает , если вы запустите его в оконном режиме , его собираешься аварии и не сохранить ваш прогресс , запустить его в полноэкранном режиме , позвольте мне сказать вам ... Вы Финна разбить свой компьютер . В полноэкранном ФПС ужасно, и нестабильной игры . Там эта черная полоса в верхней , которая мне на нервы . ИДК , если его компьютер или игра , Может быть, его моем компьютере.

If you liked FNAF then you will definitely enjoy this one. Similar premise except you don't sit in one location like a log. You are a pizza man who is here to fulfill his duty. The catch is that no one is home.. or so you think.\n\nI believe that this game may be a hit or miss. If some big youtubers pick it up then it has some potential. If you are not into the whole FNAF's then you will definitely not enjoy this game. Not a whole lot more to say except that it is definitely quite scary. Big on the jump scares, so beware!\n\nThe verdict so far:\n\nDoes it have replayability value? Yes. You can play with your friends and poop your pants with them together.\n\nDoes it have the 1$/Hr value? Probably, even though I have just done a quick playthrough, there is still much more to do.\n\nDoes it have game-breaking bugs?

Well, that depends, if you are into the whole FNAF-sort of game then you will enjoy this one, otherwise you should pass.\n\nVerdict: FNAF fans: 8/10\nnon-FNAF friends: 6-7/10\n\nThis game is not meant to be a long playthrough, it is meant to be played in short burts, so keep that in mind.\n\nIf you would like to see some gameplay then check out a video I made, it is a quick 5 minute video of me soiling myself:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DT6656-KM40&feature=youtu.be\n\nAnd for those of you who are wanting to push the game/figure out how to beat it, I have a walkthrough for it right now, starting at 1AM.. check it out:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80RswXhRJl4","December 10, 2015","true","2.3"," 36 of 69 people (52%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","52","36","69","5","4"

The first and second rounds were very easy. Most of my deaths from Round 2 and 3 were from Mr. Tattles the clown, due to shaking from anticipation! Round 4 with Emily started out EXTREMELLY HARD because I had no idea on what to do. But after constant playthroughs it turned out to be the easiest round in the whole game. Round 5 has all of the enemies from the first three rounds including Emily. This was awful, but through constant tries I eventually bested it and made my escape! But It takes far TOO long in between rounds which works. It works in the sense that it makes you panic and affects how you handle the game. I do have a small gripe. Upon beating the game it doesn't give you any incentive to replay the game with new modes or heck even challenges! Whether I got scared or my friends did. I had a fun time and for the $4.99 price it's an experience I reccomend!","January 31","true","0.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The devs did a good job making the jump scares very unpredictable and creepy as heck. Their patterns and noises will make you scared poopless and be much more cautious taking correct steps at every corner.\n\nSo, the game does not look super shiny or eye candy but it does not mean the game is bad. Just like the two famous sayings that sum up this game: "Never judge a book by its cover." and "The game is bad it's good."\n\nOverall, the game is pretty good.

But that I mean, without the Music turned up full blast, you notice how bland and darkly contrasted the game itself is, but that's not the point, right?\n\nThe game is actually scary. I played through this not wearing pants and by the time I was done I was wishing that I had some pants to put on to crap in so I had a reason to not be wearing pants. I lasted no longer than 20 minutes, of which about 12 was gameplay. I decided to uninstall it on the basis that my neighbours might file a noise complaint due to my girlish squeals. Not a very manly look for a manly man like myself.\n\nI'd recommend this game as a gift for people you wish pain and suffering on. Unless you are someone who seeks out jumpscare games I wouldnt recommend it. It's not much in the department of an environmental-horror game like that of games like Resident Evil or the Alien horror game as this seems to rely more on reactive frights as opposed to engaging the player with deep story elements allow the player to creat their own nightmare out of the fear they have created themself.\n\nI cant really judge it though, I didnt really las tmore than 10 minutes.","December 13, 2015","true","0.3"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Oh this game.\n\nLike all my reveiws, first the synopsis.\n\nEmily wants to Play is a first-person horror game. You play as a pizza delivery boy, who is on his last house for the night. Upon arrival, the door is wide open and the house seems abandoned, yet the family had just moved in. No one is home, and you enter, desperate to get out of the rain. That's where everything goes wrong. There are creepy dolls everywhere, and a little girl named Emily owns them. Emily is hiding, Her dolls are seeking. They stalk your every move, and If you spen too much time doing one thing, they will kill you. Find Emily, don't die.\n\nFirst, I was bored, and bought this to pass the time. I found myself jumping and screaming the whole game. (i have not beat it yet) It's cheap, and a great play. Hard, but thats ok. Scary, really scary. And the lack of music while playing makes it 10x more terryfing.\n\nStory: 5/10\nGameplay: 6/10 (standard horror click and move)\nGraphics: 7/10\nHorror/scares: 9/10\n\n","December 15, 2015","true","0.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ficktdich/recommended/416590/","ficktdich","Claytonious","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ficktdich/","337 products in account","Like any budget horror game, take Emily Wants To Play for what it is. I will be honest, the first fifteen minutes or so are pretty scary. There is little in terms of guidance on what to expect, or how to play. This uncertainty contributes to an aura of discomfort that is pretty well done with the limited scope of the game. Unfortunately, this discomfort is conditional on a key assumption, namely the assumption that the player engages the game without help from a FAQ.\n\nThe "scare-factor" of the game significantly declines after a few attempts. Without knowledge of the game mechanics, the game can feel like a stochastic whirlwind of scares. Yet, this randomness quickly fades into a discernable pattern. Once the player recognizes this pattern of game play, the game becomes more akin to a first-person horror platformer puzzle game.\n\nRecommended for its vision, but one must be realistic in terms of execution. I don't expect a $5 game to be the pinnacle of game design, so I think that it is inherently unfair to judge it as a more fully developed title.\n\nTLDR: Good for what you are buying ($5). Do yourself a favor and don't spoil the game story/mechanics when attempting to play. A good game to play in the dark alone, or with friends and beer.\n\n","December 23, 2015","true","1.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sniper2568/recommended/416590/","sniper2568","Jeffrey Dahmer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sniper2568/","101 products in account","Very interesting game. Seeing a lot of inspiration from other horror titles like Five Nights at Freddy's (Time system and enemy rules) and some other titles.\n\nThis is not a "collect 8 pages" style game, but instead a pure survival game!\n\n*GAMEPLAY SPOILERS (NOT STORY SPOILERS)*\n\nThe game doesn't give you full instructions, so allow me to explain it:\n\n\n\nThere are four enemies in the game, three dolls and Emily.\nThere are five hours of play, six in total (six is the escape)\nEach hour is roughly six minutes long\nThe order of spawns are: Kiki - Little girl in black (12:00am), Mr Tatters - clown (1:00am/Along with Kiki), Chester - man in suit (2:00am/Along with Tatters but no Kiki), All three dolls - Kiki, Taters, and Chester (3am), Emily - little girl (4:00am/At this hour, it is ONLY Emily, no other enemies), All four enemies - Kiki, Tatters, Chester, and Emily (5:00am), Emily (6am/Will kill you if you don't escape on time)\n\nEvery enemy has its own rules, which are listed below:\n\nKiki: When she appears (listen for her audio que, which is a little girl's laugh) turn around until you spot her, stare at her until she disappears. She will only move (and kill you) if you are not looking at her, so stare at her.\n\nMr Tatters: When he appears (listen for his audio que, which is a demonic, deep male laugh) DON'T MOVE AT ALL, NOT EVEN A FLICK OF THE MOUSE! Stay still until he disappears (when he disappears, he gives a slight exhaling noise, but do not confuse it with any of his other noises). If you do happen to move, he will charge you and kill you.\n\nChester: This is the tricky one. When chester appears (listen for his audio que, which is a high pitch male laugh) GET THE HECK OUT OF THE ROOM. You only have a few seconds to escape the room before he goes into a full on sprint to kill you. Make sure you keep yourself out of situations where he can trap you. Have many exits.\n\nEmily: Emily is going to be the biggest threat. When she appears, a 90-second timer will appear at the bottom of your screen; this is the amount of time you have to find her before she kills you. On her initial spawn at 4am, it will only be you and her, but at 5am the other dolls step in to play. Emily can always be found at any time by falling into the basement, regardless if the game has started or not.\n\nAt 6am, the front door will open and you have only a few seconds to escape before Emily gets you.\n\nMy favorite spot to play in is the living room, it offers many doors to escape from chester, three light switches so you can turn the lights back on.\n\nAt 2am, you will only have Chester and Tatters. A way to beat this night easy is: The enemies will alternate in a pattern, Chester>Tatters>Chester>Taters...etc. Wait at a doorway and listen for chester to spawn, go through the door then turn around. Chester is gone. Remove hands off keyboard and mouse, wait for Tatters to spawn and despawn. Put hands back on keyboard and mouse and listen for Chester to spawn. When he does go back through the door. Rinse and repeat until 3am,\n\nBe careful with Kiki though, I've had her spawn without the audio que and sometimes she spawns in really weird spots.","January 3","true","4.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Emily Wants to Play sees the player attempting to deliver an invisible pizza and being subsequently trapped in the house with a lovely little girl and her three dolls.\n\nThe player must move around, keep themselves in lit areas (preferably) and avoid all the dolls, plus Emily herself come midnight and onward until the early morning. Each doll has a strategy to them, and with all three out it is sure to be fantastically frustrating.\n\nThe pros:\n\n- Pretty nice looking game\n- Sound effects are crisp and add tension as well as audible aids against enemies\n- The dolls being able to interact with the light switches and doors is an interesting idea and used well\n- Hints at a somewhat interesting story here and there\n\nThe cons:\n\n- Jumpscare heavy. This is eased once the player learns the strategies and patterns to each doll, but they are still very much so in your face and obnoxious\n- The opening theme is almost note for note taken from The Grudge\n- Unclear objectives initially. The dolls have hints to them in the house, to some degree, but the rest is essentially left up to the play to wonder about and probably die a few times\n- Story and gameplay aren't really anything all that deep or new\n\nConclusions:\n\nEmily Wants to Play is a familiar horror experience with some interesting mechanics mixed in. While it may lose any tension after the few jumpscares and suffer from a lack of direction, it is a fun little horror game to play through for anyone looking for a decent horror game or a few jumpscares.","January 28","true","0.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I haven't been this jumpy in a long time. The scares in this game are excellent and the concept is amazing.\n\nTwitch LIVE Gameplay Highlight - Twitch.tv/halios00\nLive play of the game - Warning, Language is sometimes pretty strong.\n\nStory\nYou are a pizza delivery guy. You get a call for a large pepperoni with anchovies to a home. Normal order, normal place, right? Yeah, that's what they want you to think. You arrive to a home that the front door is wide open. You peek in and yell to see if anyone is home. That's when your night starts. When it ends, Emily will decide.\n\n\nGraphics\nNot the greatest. I don't believe the developers were going for futuristic graphics when they made this game. They made everything detailed but not cutting edge.\n\n\nSound\n.....yea, they got this one pretty much perfect. God, I hate these noises.\n\n\nSetting\nVery creepy. The house is boxed up here and there, like the family is moving and makes for tense moments when you are trying to move quickly through the house. The home is small but seems huge when a scary moment is happening.\n\n\nMood\nTense and scary. They captured the feeling of uncertainty and the pressure of fighting for your life beautifully.\n\n\nReplayability\nYou WILL lose. And lose. And lose. Then you will start to understand how things work and start to succeed. Once you beat it, it would be fun to go back and show friends or beat again.\n\n\nFinal Say\nThe premise, mood, and general feeling you get from this game is excellent. It's been a long time since I've felt this crazy tension that hits you the moment the game starts and it never ceases. It actually intensifies near the end, when impossible odds are placed against you. This live action Five Nights at Freddys will keep you guessing and jumping until the final credits.\n\n\nFinal Score - 8/10","December 15, 2015","true","2.0"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

There are no real instructions which leads you to discover things on your own. If you don't enjoy jump scares then you don't need to play this game.\n\nWe played this game (3 dudes) while taking turns and watching each other's reactions. It can be fun if you up the stakes with a punishment for losing (eating gross flavoured jelly beans is our personal favorite). For a few dollars and an hour of entertainment for three people, it wasn't a bad purchase.\n\nUnlike FNAF, it can be challenging to figure out why exactly you died in-game. We looked up some instructions in the other Steam reviews which immediately "killed" the game for us. Without any knowledge it can be frustrating and with all the knowledge you're left with a deflated balloon. Choose carefully whether or not you want to spoil the win conditions for yourself.\n\nI personally couldn't see myself purchasing this game for me alone. Unless you're a very enthusiastic indie horror gamer (or you're streaming your gameplay), you may want to skip this short title. If you want a few laughs with your friends together with a few brown stains on your couch then Emily Wants To Play is a solid choice.","December 14, 2015","true","0.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Maybe wait for a sale to roll around to get it if you're just curious but other than that, it's still worth a buy if you REALLY love these kinds of games\n\nKind Of A Con But Mainly A Personal Annoyance:\n\n- after midnight, Emily can randomly appear inside a room as a static model and it seems like she can only kill you when your back is turned (like in SCP- Containment Breach) but other than that, it's kinda disappointing when you discover that you can just walk right up and bump into her so long as she's in your sight.  seems like that'd logically be an opportune time for her to jump at you.\n\nI haven't played long enough to get killed by the clown or the dummy since I chickened out after 10 minutes, but like I said before, I think this game is definitely worth the price tag to at least check out if you like survival horror.","December 11, 2015","true","0.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Very tense, but a bit more polish could have helped.\n\nThe game's objective is essentially to survive a 6 hour stay while avoiding encounters with monstrous dolls that have gained a life of their own.\nInitially very fun and exciting but in the later sections you might suffer with potentially unwinnable scenarios that frustratingly force you to try it over again. You'll have to pray to RNGesus for a decent shot at winning, it seems.\nIt's strangely somewhat similar to 5 Nights at Freddy's in that if you want to reach the end, you need to treat the game strategically and keep your wits about you.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AZJWqU19_k","January 4","true","2.1"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TuxedoVaile/recommended/416590/","TuxedoVaile","Tuxedo Vaile","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TuxedoVaile/","95 products in account","I got a review copy of this game from the developer, and initially I couldn't get the game to run. I shot the developer an email and he replied within minutes and even once we determined that the issue was my computer and nothing to do with his game he still continued to help me. So, off that alone I can easily recommend buying games from this developer.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=572852197\n\nTHE GAME REVIEW! - "If you like FNaF, games of hide and seek, and a good challenge and heart pounding jump scares, this game is exactly what you need in your life then."\n\nAlright, so to start things off I really must say how impressed I am at how well polished this game is. Graphically it stands tall above a lot of other small team indie games, even the level design is pretty well organized. Right out of the door I didn't encounter a single bug or glitch (minus some clipping in one of the closets but this happens to AAA games even).\nThe game does a very good job of building suspense with it's use of sounds and silence in combination with the lighting and constant threat of the dolls.\n\nThe game however doesn't really explain itself all that well and leaves you to kind of figure it out on your own, at least in terms of how you survive anyway. From what I've been able to gather it's like Five Night's at Freddy's in that you need to survive until a certain time, however that sure as hell is not easy becuase the doll's are viciously relentless. This game doesn't want to hold your hand in any way and in a way I kind of like that. Though I do feel that things could have been outlined a bit better in some way or another.\n\nOn another note, even though the sound design is great, the voice over work isn't as much so. Don't get me wrong, we've all heard far worse in the 90's and in plenty of other titles found on gamejolt or even here on Steam. It's good enough to easily write off, but if voice acting is something you truly care about and desire to be strong and good, well, this game might not satisfy you there. In my opinion though it in no way ruined nor should ruin the experience of the game in any way.\n\nAll in all, It's obvious that the developer had vision and knew how to follow through with it. Now having this experience under his belt, I'd love to see what else he can do, especially if he ever could put together a larger team. This game isn't perfect but considereng every angle it's a fantastic and well mad game! If you like FNaF, games of hide and seek, and a good challenge and heart pounding jump scares, this game is exactly what you need in your life then.","December 10, 2015","true","1.6"," 9 of 22 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","9","22","0","0"

However, things take a turn for the worse when the police catch you trespassing on private property and the third portion of the game revolves mainly around defending the main character as the side character Phoenix Justice, to prove Pizza Man's innocence.  The game hits many controversial subjects such as lesbianism and child pornography, in a mature manner.  All in all, this is a great game for those with a little more patience for a more serious game the industry sorely needs.","December 23, 2015","true","0.1"," 15 of 35 people (43%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","43","15","35","28","0"

Visually it looks pretty good. Controls for either keyboard or gamepad are good. As far as what you do, thats up for debate. There is plenty of notes around the house, that give you some insight but no real idea if you are just there to get jumpscared into oblivion or if there is some way to beat it. I thought maybe you had to find Emily's pals before you were killed or maybe you had to get pass good ol' Em in the basement which seems impossible. Or is there a key somewhere that opens the only other door aside from the front that is "locked"?  I recommend to anyone looking for a good scare and/or are into these kind of games. As for the cost, if this is all the game is I would wait for a sale. I got it for a little over $2 because of credits.\n","December 10, 2015","true","1.2"," 3 of 14 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","3","14","0","0"

So in the end, this game should be called "The Idiotic pizza man breaks into a house and gets his *** handed 2 him by a bunch of toys". The story is good but lets face it, the Pizza man was flippin' ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. This IS a good game and a handy tool to get your adrenaline pumping but, come on. You would expect us 2 get a main character that is smart, heroic and has the guts too beat up a few toys. Like I said, A good game, but how about a little character development (and a pizza guy that has the guts too beat the crap outta some toys AND doesn't have a habit of breaking into people's houses after they don't answer the door. He got himself into this one! and at times, I don't wanna get him outta it).\n\nBOTTOM LINE:\ngood game, idiotic main character, and a suprising level of lag. But Still....Try it out.
