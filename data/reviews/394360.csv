I've got almost too much to say about this game and all things considered this review is waay too long. Unfortunately, I've spent so much time playing this game over the past week that I've barely had time to properly express my thoughts. So let's just vomit some english and see what happens.\nTL:DR Version:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9YCij8CoYk\nFirst and foremost, this is a divisive opinion but I did not like the logistic system of hearts of iron 3 at all. Having to connect brigades and HQs and all that nonsense into a working force was a bit too complicated in my opinion. It turned the micromanagement up to 11 when it should've beena 9. Hearts of Iron 2 and Darkest Hour still had supply systems and intense micromanagement but it was done on a simplistic interface and didn't require you to worry about dragging around dozens of HQ's everywhere your soldiers marched. if HOI was turn based, I could see a system like that working but in realtime it feels more like a gimmick to encumber the player.\n\nHOI IV replaces this system with a much more interesting if slightly imperfect system. Now, commanders are given a set of Army and Battleplan creation tools. The process is simple, you select a number of divisions, click the create army button, set a frontline and then have access to offensive plans, garrison plans etc etc. These plans can then be executed by the AI so a whole theater can be conquered and controlled all by a simple click of the mouse.\nWhat's better, if the plan goes awry there is a simple "Stop" button that pauses unit attacks and forces the AI to restructure along the newly conquered territory.\nDon't think this completely replaces micromanagement because you're still able to control units on an individual basis or in selection groups that don't affect the movements and attacks of the rest of the units in the army.\n\nWhile the overall idea and execution are pretty fantastic, there are a few hiccups... like the AI sometimes not advancing even when a front is left completely undefended. This is the most common problem and is generally solved by direct player intervention. Sometimes the frontline drawing tool can mess up causing units to stack up on the wrong provinces, again this can be solved by creating a new Army and resetting your frontline. Other issues include clutter. When multiple armies' objectives connect, the screen becomes easily cluttered by offensive line indicators. In some situations it just feels like you're better off moving troops by yourself.\n\nIn summation, I love the new battleplan system. It really takes a load off of  the player and allows you to just watch your "generals" take control of the war. It especially comes in handy when you are fighting in multiple theaters and at times is an absolute godsend.\n\nAir war has also become a bit more streamlined in Hearts of Iron IV. No longer do you directly control aircraft like your land divisions. Air Wings are given their own panel which shows where planes are, what they are doing, their effectiveness and even keeps track of how many are lost or how many kills you've made. You're probably wondering how this works, well simply put,you assign planes to an air wing which is restricted by type of plane and then you\nassign that air wing to an air region and then rebase them to the nearest air base. Once there, you can choose a mission for them depending on their type, so air superiority, air interception, strategic bombing, ground support and so on. Plans will then conduct their missions as long as they are still alive in the area or until all your enemies are dead. You can customize their behavior to a degree by adjusting when they conduct missions and so on.\nIf your planes are losing the air war in a region, you can even ground them to try and minimize losses until you have the necessary number to fight back.\n\nHearts of Iron IV also changes up the industrial system in the game. In other games you would use sliders to assign industrial capacity to production, consumer goods etc etc. Now, you have 3 different types of factories; First is Civilian Factories which are used to trade for resources, construct buildings and automatically produce consumer goods depending on your country's economic laws. Second you have Military factories which produces all infantry weapons,\ntanks, and airplanes. Finally, you have Naval Dockyards which produce convoys and various naval vessels. While there are more buildings such as the nuclear reactor and synthetic refinery, the primary producers are these three buildings.\nPersonally, I enjoy this new take on production. It allows you to take direct control of production by swapping factory output on the fly as the war drags on. And now because each unit costs up to 3 different resources there is more importance in effectively managing your economic situation... do you trade off construction speed for more KV-1 production or do you wait and build more synthetic refineries? Personally, love this new system.\n\nOn the discussion of production and creation, research has also been changed a bit. Where the Hearts of Iron 3 tech tree decided to create far more options than could ever be researched in one game, HOI 4 has gone back to the Hearts of Iron 2 approach with general research options that unlock new units and technologies the further down you go.\nWhat I love the most about this new research tree is even small countries have a chance to keep up in technology as long as they focus on certain areas. Yes, this means that Mexico can build nuclear weapons by around 1945 if you tech right and have enough research slots.\nSome of you are probably sad and feel like now you can't customize your land armies like you could in HOI 3 because of the simplified tech tree, well there is more customization now then there ever was. For example, in the production panel, when you are creating a tank, or an airplane, you can customize the level of gun, engine, reliability, and armor of your tank using Army experience that is gained in your "hopefully" never ending conflicts.\nThis leads to your tanks having increased utility even if they are a few years behind on the tech tree. It's worth mentioning the national focus system as well as this allows you to customize your playstyle as whatever country you are playing as. For example, if you are playing as the Soviet Union, it gives you bonus towards an anti fascist playstyle or as an anti capitalistic playstyle depending on who you are trying to ally with in the war. National Focus can also give bonuses towards factories, troop recovery rates, research slots and so on so forth.\n\nThe last major change I will discuss is the Create Faction feature of the game. In other Hearts of Iron games, you were limited to three different factions, Comintern, Allies and Axis. In HOI IV you can actually create your own faction... or a preset faction already available. For example, Italy can form the Novus Imperium Romanum or join the Axis, Allies, or Comintern. I played a game as Mexcio where I created my own South American Faction called the Imperio de Sud and proceeded to grab as many south american countries as I could.\nIt's actually a really cool system that makes staging coups all over the world a freaking treat.\n\nTruly, the only flaw or issue I have with this game is that the AI can be strange. It makes a mixture of unrealistically unpredictable and sometimes completely idiotic decisions. Of which I'm sure you will experience. I also feel it should be mentioned that due to some of the AI issues I've experienced, it makes me think that HOIIV is more geared towards multiplayer. Keep in mind that's a good thing for those who get bored with the AI easily. Can't wait to see some additional content and get going with some multiplayer matches.\n\nHighly recommended to newcomers of the IP and veterans alike.","June 6","true","1.6"," 105 of 146 people (72%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","72","105","146","13","4"

Firstly, performance is a nightmare. Once WW2 got rolling really well and a lot of units were getting fielded, and started running amok across my carefully crafted bunkers, I noticed framerates dropping below 20FPS.\n\nWhile this isn’t a game of fluid animations and quick reactions, drops that big are still a big problem and my biggest critique on the title regarding its optimization. It truly starts to chug when things start getting hot on the world map.\n\nThe second issue is not an unexpected one from paradox…and that is that the tutorial is ♥♥♥♥ poor. It barely explains the base UI Concepts and gameplay idea’s while throwing you into the deep end, so going in you can expect to be reading the wiki, watching the YouTube video’s and reading the 30 page manual if you want to get stuff done with any competence.\n\nHaving said that – the game has a ton going for it, outside of the obvious and ever-loving support for the modding scene. My main love for this game is that it allows deviation from historical accuracy if you desire to do so.\nYou can to go democratic Germany? Fascist USA? Japan Allied with America to take out China? YOU CAN! Obviously, you can also go for historical accuracy for the Ai.\n\nFurther, a normally very subpar part of a wargaming title is the graphical representation of the units, combat and various zones of control…. HoI 4 does a phenomenal job using great visual and audio design to convey information about units, compositions, positions, defenses, land type and so on.\n\nIt takes very little time to get an intuitive grasp on the visual side of things and translate that to possible action to can and should take. The game doesn’t trade in mechanical depth in any form for this either, a true win-win situation.\nFurther, while the diplomacy can feel restrictive if you pick a minor power to play with, because you are locked out of many conflicts early on, you can still choose to play an unorthodox pick like The Netherlands or other minor nations, allowing for much more replay ability and deviation from the “norm” than you would have otherwise.\n\nLastly, the depth and complexity you want and desire in a wargaming title is here, and that means proper planning, execution and managing the entire geo-political situation is perfect to a T.\n","June 6","true","22.2"," 124 of 196 people (63%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","63","124","196","6","13"

The music and atmosphere are great and its optimization is really good. The game is challenging, more complex, intricate and deep.\n\nwell, Hearts of Iron is far from Command & Conquer. It has lots of buttons, for starters. HOI is a big, serious series where players take control of any nation to rewrite history, through diplomacy, industry, and force across the entire globe. It’s a big simulation, starting with the war in its historical state but able to diverge massively from history.\n\nHearts of Iron 4 is shaping up well. It's slick and clever, and while there's not much, visually, to the moment that troops clash, the point of conflict in HoI is an almost incidental result of a vast continent-wide engineering effort. It's a game about careful, detailed state organisation and top-level strategy. You pull arrows across the map with a push of the mouse, painting out your strategy with sweeping gestures that give physical form to the feelings of power and control that drive a good grand strategy game.The new 3D look is swish, The old 2D style was practical, sure, but this is proper pleasant.

Or how to increase the reinforcement limit of airwings so you can continue to fill them with the planes you're producing, or how to manage occupied territories and switch occupation methods, etc...)\n\nI feel that for the in-game tutorial to be successful the player should be left with enough information to hop into the game as a major power and have some idea of what they're doing. The fact that the tutorial doesn't cover all types of warfare, land, sea, and air is just inexcusable. Make Jake's entire job working on tutorials with that sweet sweet glaswegian ASMR voice of his.\n\nEither way, I love this game and see myself playing it for a loooong time to come.","June 6","true","46.2"," 20 of 35 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","20","35","0","0"

Been a fan of paradox for years now and this seems to be the most interactive and overall control of the entire war and peace effort much more than ever before. The game may be hard for beginners but tutorials and hints help novice players along the way, and if one doesn't like to wait for action they can start at the beginning of the war instead. The game is fantastic and I had to get it the first day, but my system may not be able to control a game with graphics and overall units that encompass the entire world. The game seems clunky at times, but after graphic readjustments my computer seems to do fine. Also, one thing I noticed right away was a discoloration that covers much of the world, I don't know if its just my computer, but it seems to be a large part of the map with pink, blue, green and red lines that cover a large amount of the world map if you zoom out. This discoloration blots out independent zones that denote country and national colors. Just thought I would add that to see if it's a bug or just my graphics card.","June 6","true","6.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Even at this early stage, I can see it's the strongest WWII simulator around.\n\nStarted as facist Japan in 1936 (I chose veteran/ironman despite having no prior HOI experience), found myself in control of large swaths of China, Korea and a dozen or so islands (as would be accurate for the time). I quickly allied with Germany and Italy who had no trouble arranging terms with me, I now have military access to those countries if I desire. The situation in China seems the most troublesome right now, the Soviets are bolstering their border and Chang-Kai Shek and Mao are still around as opposing factions of China. I do have one ally in the form of Inner Mongolia, a pro-Japan puppet state.\n\nCurrently working on promoting the facist party in the Philipines (itself a puppet state of the US) and building an army to attack both Chinese factions. As Hirohito I'm promoting Chinese border tensions as part of my Japan focus tree.

HOI4 allows for more replayability, as it allows for more alternate history scenarios compared ot HOI3.\n\nThe atmosphere of the game is amazing and immerses you in the world war 2 era. The music, loading screen art, and art style sets the appropriate mood for the game. The graphics are the best Paradox has ever done so far. The interface also feels fluid and organized. The battle plan mechanic is revolutionary - you won't have to tediously micromanage hundreds of divisions like in HOI3, but it doesn't feel like everything has been oversimplified either.\n\nHowever, there are still some flaws. The battle plans can get wonky when fighting in unusual geography. My battle plans were messing up near the great lakes region in North America, for example. Also, there is a lack of map modes and information interfaces in the game. For example, you can't check how much manpower or industry a country has, even if they are your ally.\n\nPros:\n- UI\n- Graphics & art style\n- Complex, but not overwhelmingly difficult to master\n\nCons:\n- Lack of map modes\n- Lack of information (no ledger like other paradox games)","June 6","true","32.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

For one, there's no organic NATO symbols, so one is forced to use a mod for them. The map and units are quite confusing and jumbled because of this. It's difficult to actually tell what's going on in any sort of timely manner. Some of the controls are confusing and jumbled as well. Figuring out how to use air power effectively is a real headache, as well as trying to figure out what to do when one actually wins a war.\n\nThen again, there's a lot of things that are really good about HiO4 as well. The ability to create fronts, armies, and plans for use by one's armies is really cool, but need a little work too. The graphics are really good, as is the sound. Many of the panels are pretty steamlined, but it still seems to be missing some things too- like espionage, and intelligence and the like.\n\nOverall, this is a great start to what can be an amazing game- it needs a lot of work, and there's plenty of room for expansion too!","June 6","true","3.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Compared to the old Hearts of Iron III this game is much easier to manage, less complicated, and less micro managing recquired as well as an addition of very good mod support and a sandbox mode. Another good addition is the changeable governments, it really reminds me of VIctoria II, another great game by Paradox of being able to change your government and then your flag changes and the name changes it is some nice extra spice. But of course some people wish to play railroaded to the historical layout of the whole war which is still possible. Something else I greately enjoy is the fact that there is now casualties counted, in Hearts of Iron III you were really blind about this it just said you have lets say 1000 manpower and it would slowly trickle down but you never knew how many men died but with this there is an accurate manpower pool not just a vague number and casualties so you can see was it worth it? The battle plans are another improvement, in Hearts of Iron 3 there were just there for visuals but now you can actually enact them. The only thing that this game really needs is espionage and I am sure it will be added later as a DLC.","June 6","true","7.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Whoever thought that one up should be shot for treason.\n-Provinces have been clumped together instead of being distinct which is just lazy.\n-Soundtrack literally put me to sleep.\n-Overall the game seems to have moved from the concept of deep immersive gameplay to a more visually pleasing experience (and only in certain respects)\n\nWhich leads me to the pros:\n-Nicer graphics for the "sprites" and map.\n\nSave yourself 50$.-","June 6","false","1.3"," 41 of 85 people (48%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","48","41","85","3","3"

I love Paradox, and HOI has been my favorite game EVER!!! So, to say this, crushes me-- especially since I've been anticipating this game for a year! The best way I can say this is, HOI 1-3 was novel, complex, immersive, and fun. However, HOI 4 is the opposite and tasteless. I really feel like the proper analogy would be comparing HOI 1-3 with Friday the 13th 1-4, both glorious and innovative; and HOI 4 to Friday the 13th: Jason X (Jason goes to space), ridiculous and lame.\nMy favorite developers have gone too far; gotten way off track. Worse of all, I can't even envision a way in which this could be fixed with patches and expansions, because it will still be based off a simple foundation. Humbly, though, I hope I am wrong. Please quit going the road of simplifying and eroding the quality of this once great game, Paradox. I still love you, just not HOI4. I end this by saying, for the first time ever, I have asked for a refund on a game.","June 6","false","2.3"," 14 of 36 people (39%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","39","14","36","0","3"

The key word being "Could".\n\nThe AI is currently very slow and can't react fast enough. Even on hard I was able to take France  four months into the game due too the AI wouldn't react to anything. Also they're not agressive at all, they will sit there and take all the abuse and do nothing about it.\n\nAll though the graphics are much better and the industry system is better, the war system itself is broken and needs to be fixed, also resoruces are broken as well. I was playing as the USSR and I ran out of resources which are natural many times.\n\nI wouldn't suggest buying this until atleast one or two patchs are out. However again, this can be the best HoI to date if they fix it correctly.\n\n(Add on since review post)\n\nI've now played over an hour and I tried to play as USA and Germany (Again).\nUSA is such a slow start, I'm in the middle of the new deal and yet I get a negative modifer on Industry? Also, why isn't there an "New Deal" National Focus? As USA you can't do anything until a war starts, in HoI 2 and 3, you could do whatever you wanted as USA. Here you feel so trapped and it feels the game is forcing you to do nothing. I know the USA was like that in real life, but this is Alt History damnit. Give me a little more freedom on what I want my nation to do!!!\n\nNow my second run as Germany I had the same problems as the first one, but I found out something new. The Planning system breaks randomly. You will make a plan then it's removed five minutes later. OR You try to make a plan, and it for some reason teleports your plan to another part of the front line.\n\nEditing for your plan is very broken, you'll be lucky if it works on the first time...\n\nThis review is up for change as I haven't played that much into the Mid/End Game, this is just my imperssions of the begining game.","June 6","false","2.6"," 66 of 147 people (45%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","45","66","147","7","13"

They will destroy everything they want, they can cross the whole desert in an hour and blow all your destroyers, journalists, diplomats. George you are a cowboy! Stop now! Forget it! Hide bullets in the warehouses away. And forget your daddy. We had one dumbass, he had revenged for his brother and the whole Glory Russian Empire crashed. And another weirdo who had revenged for his grandfather the USSR collapsed after that. And you will repeat these mistakes. Leave your father alone. He has finished his work already. Think about the future of the States, it is collapsing, young people flee from your country. Nobody wants to live in the States, NO ONE! It is a second-hand goods' store. Dollar, dollar, dollar! This is dirty green paper. Soulless! No composers, you have no writers. The whole World listens to Chaikovsky and Dostoevsky. Festivals, sport! Only in Russia. Russia here and Iraq. People love their president here and you are despised. Despised! Your predecessor — Clinton. He had his pants unzipped right in his office! Its all ♥♥♥♥ed up when some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the president's cabinet does a blow-job to mr. President. Is it what the USA is all about? Holy ♥♥♥♥ shall long. What are you doing out there? Monica! Nothing else metters — president, war, Middle East! ♥♥♥♥ suckers all around, handjobbers, ♥♥♥♥♥♥s! George! Watch any cowboy movie look how many dead bodies, blood. Murders here, murders there. Here… I'm talking to you from HERE! Look at the sky — it's Baghdad! Baghdad is not Berlin, is not Kabul. You will never win there as we know local people, we know this president. He is the only one on Earth who tells you to ♥♥♥♥ off. The only one! All others are too afraid in front of you, they stay in the line to bow low before you. And he is the only one who sits there for 11 years. For 11 years he's been resisting you! And you with your "powerful" ♥♥♥♥♥♥ economy, your million soldier army, your fleet and missiles can do nothing. You drop bombs daily, you kill children, while the Iraqi soldiers are ready to fight. You are afraid to send your troops there. And you have been afraid for 11 years, your papa had also feared. The apple never falls far from the tree. You will never win there! This will be your fatal fiasco. Napoleon has lost the Waterloo, Hitler has lost the battle for Berlin and you will lose Baghdad. Baghdad is your tomb. You hear me, George — damn cowboy? You need back to Texas, to your ranch. Drive around your empty lands in Jeep and start learning spanish. And New-York will have spoken russian already. We will send another 10 million of Russians to the States and will elect our own President for the US. And you, George, will get a good cell in the Butirka prison. Do you get me? George, you will never be victorious here. All Arabs and Muslims of the world, the whole eastern Europe, Moscow is against you. Moscow doesn't want this war and our President has clearly told you^ do not fire at Baghdad. Let's better blow up Tbilissi together or Baku, or other cities. We will find other targets on the Earth. The Earth is so large — we can sink Australia into the oceans depths if you like. Alright! Wanna see our missiles? Our weapons now… at night our scientists will change gravitation field of the Earth a little bit and your country will be under the water. 24 hours and your whole country will be under the water of the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans. Think about who you are playing with? Think! You forgot what Bonapart's end, Hitler's end was, all others? You will make a historical mistake, your father won't be grateful to you, forget him, your daddy. Your generals tell you not to start war. Still it is not too late! Today is just the 21th of June 1941! But if tomorrow morning you send your fighters to Baghdad it will be your own tomb, you will die in this war. And no one will bury you as you hit the whole country, the whole humanity. 6 billions people do not want this war to happen SIX! SIX BILLION. You ignorant, do you know how to count? One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six billion. Whole planet is against you. You are the only one who wants war and this ♥♥♥♥ — Condoleezza Rice. She is a half-black ♥♥♥♥♥ who needs a good ♥♥♥♥.

(Or 100th or more probably ;) )\n\nNo, but I'm just happy it's here after more than 2 years waiting for it. I started following the development of this game just after moving to a new country, so you can say I've waited the entire time I've lived in this country for this game.\nJudging the many beta streams it's a worthy succesor to the series I've played myself since HOI2, and there's no way I'm not going to like it. Hence the positive review with 5 minutes played, which for my old computer proved to be a smooth experience :)\n\nEdit: Played the game in multiplayer with 5 players in total for about 7 hours. This nearly without a pause from the moment of release. I'm happy to say that my impressions from the pre-release streams were right. They didn't f it up.\nIt is one of those games where you think: Just one more minute. The game mechanics and interface are very intuitive. Besides an occasional desynch (not as annoying as in HOI3, since rejoining/restarting is easy as pie) this multiplayer session went without a glitch.

Where is the Armenian Genocide? W H E R E!?!?!?!? I must say that I always make negative reviews, if in game is no reference of the Armenian genocide, regardless of genre. Whether it's sims, town planning simulators, action games, RPG, MMO, sports simulators, educational games for kids, anime porn… It doesn't matter. No mention of the Armenian genocide? Well, get a negative review!\n\nI haven't checked whether there is in the game the genocide of the Jews. Probably because I don't care about Jews. Maybe paradoxes added this event in the game, because the Jewish community more influential and numerous than Armenian. And I am very happy for the Jews, if this is so. Do not think that I'm jealous or that I am anti-Semite. I just want to say that we should not forget the small and poor nations, who were also oppressed by the stronger countries. As an argument in favor of the fact that I am not an anti-Semite, I can say that I have all the albums of Judas Priest, and i even went to their two concerts! This is a religious Jewish group which preaches Judaism, like Christian rock, for example? I'm right?\n\nYou know, I have a conspiracy theory... And it is quite logical, does not cost a laugh and speak maliciously. It seems to me that Paradox Interactive specifically avoids this sharp topic. And not because they were afraid of the wrath of the Turkish audience. The reason is that they were publishers TaleWorlds. That is, they are their suzerain. And for this reason do not want to spoil relations with them. But we all know that Germany recently recognized the Armenian Genocide, despite its dominance over turkey. In fact, many countries dominated over turkey, the turks are accustomed to a subordinate position. And all these countries have recognized the Armenian Genocide (France, Russia, Italy etc etc). REPEAT again: even Germany, during First World War ignored the Armenian genocide, it is now recognized him. Even Sweden recognized the Armenian Genocide. Paradox interactive (Swedish company, by the way) – none. And it's very bad.\n\nThe last paragraph. If a miracle happens and the game developers add the Armenian Genocide, it is necessary to make it the images with atrocities of the Turks and touching music. On the pictures and photos have to be the murder scene of men, violence against women and crying children. For music I suggest the compositions of Eric Satie, Wagner, Grieg and Dorcel. All this should cause a feeling of compassion for the Armenians among players. Why I wrote this (you say)? I posted this because in the past games completely ignored tolerance. Look what they have done in the EU4:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/sQbV4nc.jpg\nWHAAAT??? CHANGE CULTURE?!!! But in this game is played are small and innocent children!!! And who they are will become when they grow up? Little Hitlers, Himmlers and Goebbels?! And what they will say, when will be held accountable for their crimes before the tribunal? "We just changed the culture in the provinces."? Are you seriously?!!!\n\nIn conclusion, I want to say one thing: IF YOU DON'T ADD IN THE GAME FULL ARMENIAN GENOCIDE – I DON'T REMOVE MY NEGATIVE REVIEW! THIS IS MY ULTIMATUM. I said everything. Ahh, not - 0/10.","June 6","false","5.9"," 106 of 1,311 people (8%) found this review helpful 270 people found this review funny","8","106","1","270","75"

The AI can get fairly wonky when not using historical focus mode, but in that mode it proceedes as it should. AI is capable of naval invasions for once, and observer mode reveals it is able to make invasion plans before actually declaring war. The move from stockpiled resources to "maintence" resources is dissapointing, as is the continued use of mana, and while I hope someone can mod it back, i imagine it's fairly ingrained into the game's workings, and frankly, I'm tired of mods that make changes without heed of how an AI handles it. All in all I'd probably give HoI4 a 7 or 8, to DH's 9, but still a good entry nontheless.\n\nIf you actually liked playing OOB Spreadsheet simulator, you probably won't like this, but if you were a big fan of HoI2 and derivitives, it will fill the itch of needing soemthing a bit more micro heravy.","June 6","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can control any country from the period of 1936/1939 and decide the fate of not only your people, but the world as a whole. The game takes place in primarily two periods. A "Build-Up" period where everyone is slowly preparing for war, making allies or enemies, and establishing political agendas. Then the "War" period when World Tension becomes so high that nearly every country becomes envolved in some way.\n\nOne of the biggest things i can say negatively about this game is the learning curve, as with all Paradox games. The easiest way to learn is simply to suck it up and watch a youtube guide.

It's like they've learned absolutely nothing since HOIII, besides how to make the map look like a kid's toy. The AI is horrific, the limitations invisible, the bugs are everywhere (Japan sent no troops to Europe in my game, but was somehow able to vassalize Luxembourg, who then swallowed France for me, and there is no command console option to take my provinces back because you need province IDs which aren't available yet) the controls change randomly (some functions you right click for, sometimes you left click, even if it's the exact same function the only difference is a change in interface). Some features are unfinished, for example the national focuses (there should be more than 7 specific ones, come on), the balance is off (France and Italy are powerful in this game, and nationalist Spain is ♥♥♥♥) and other things that you think they would have noticed sooner than they did. I love paradox games, but this is a bit annoying. To be fair, they never have good releases, but then it's fair to give it a bad review.\n\nI'll change it if I change my mind.","June 6","false","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
