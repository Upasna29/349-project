It tries to be in a way a throwback to the Battle Isle series and such games like that, on that level it feels some what similar but for me does not quite hit the sweet spot that those titles hit from an enjoyment factor.\n\nThe game itself I found to be at times hard but only if held off using the reinforcement system but other than a few missions where I feel they might have pushed the difficulty up a bit too high...the rest I considered to be about right for me. Gameplay mechanics they tried to add a few twists to the format that Battle Isle series used and while pulled it off just about I never felt it blew my mind or felt that was much better than the simpler older systems used in the past. Maybe that's more to do with my age than the mechanics themselves though...hard to tell from my own perspective since I am biased.\n\nThe story is predictable and generic but it's adequate though like with most strategy games the gameplay is the major factor in deciding to purchase these type of games rather than the storyline, the cinematic sequences felt low quality but I kind of expected that given how much funding the game got so I can't hold it against them too much. It does it's job and I have seen far worse animation quality in other more popular games. I did not like having to log in to their servers all the time though, the autosave is not great but since you can save anytime you want manually it does not detract from the quality of the game too much.\n\nMusic I felt was nice enough overall or more specifically some tracks were very nice while the rest was okay. The game feels about the right length from a story perspective given you play first one faction then the other follows right after but it could of been longer, the padding of 'cinematics' shown as segments within the campaign were it felt to me a way to disguise how few missions in the campaign there was but if they had hidden the segments (all of them from view) then I would not have noticed if I am honest. It was their visability that made it blatent to me. That has a slight negative effect much like knowing there is only x amount of chapters in a book prior to starting reading page 1 or knowing that your reaching the end of the game which I feel detracts from the experience. Not many people want to know the day the world will end for example, yet games that list every mission or sequence of the game in the campaign menu feels like someone waving a 'the end is nigh' banner in your face all the time.\n\nIf I was to rate the overall experience however, despite it's flaws...it was a positive experience and worth backing on Kickstarter or buying on Steam if I had not backed. But like all games it does have flaws. I would consider this an okay turn based strategy game that tried to recapture the older turn based titles some of us TBS fans loved back in the day but while enjoyable it does fall short on reaching those lofty heights set before it. If I was going to buy a game like this I would still pick Battle Isle Shadow of the Empire over this game and maybe couple others but if like turn based strategy games and was a fan of the Battle Isle series then you will probably enjoy this game. It may not be my favorite game in this style of turn based games but it is worthy of picking up if like that sort of game.","November 26, 2013","true","35.8"," 101 of 128 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","101","128","0","6"

But once the first impression fades away, you realize that it plays worse than Battle Isle 1 or Battalion: Nemesis or even Advanced Strategic Command (these games are either significantly less expensive or even free), The biggest downside of this game for me is that the UI is sluggish and not as assistive as it could be. As you play the game, you realize that it takes quite long, because you wait for something all the time (UI to respond, animation to finish, CPU to make a move). Note that I have a 2.9GHz Haswell i5, so the sluggishness is not about weak HW.\nThe story is not great, in-game popup story dialogs are not something you look forward to.\nThe AI is OK, sometimes stupid, ignoring you while you move around and take an advantageous position, but you are going to be grateful for that.\nI don't recommend buying the game for more than $10 unless there is a significant patch fixing the issues above. The authors had such great examples to learn from, but they probably didn't play the game much. Otherwise they would have concentrated more on gameplay than on visuals.\n\nPatch 1.1 update:\nThe developers have addressed some of the most painful issues, and the gameplay experience has improved considerably, but there is still room for improvements. What now stands out is the passivity of the AI The enemy has much more units at its disposal, but they basically just react to you when you start your offensive. Very sad when you compare it to Battle Isle 1.\nThe game is IMO worth $15 after the patch and the Battle Isle series is well recommended prior to Battle worlds: Kronos","November 25, 2013","false","10.1"," 159 of 216 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","159","216","2","3"

Use this until you get the hang of the game.\n* Capturing buildings will often get you new units. You are probably doing better than you think.\n* Move your units first, then attack. You get a bonus for having multiple attackers "flanking" an enemy.\n* In the first mission, move North as quick as you can, taking the left path and ignore the South East base. Once you take the North East base, the rest of the mission is easy.\n\nGood luck!","May 26, 2014","true","5.9"," 27 of 38 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","27","38","0","2"

The game is very challenging, and while this isn't a bad thing, it makes it feel as if there aren't any options. I am a huge fan of turn based strategy games. My favorite is XCOM ('94) which is definitely a very difficult game. It can be cruel but it's never boring.\n\nBattle World feels like there's only one solution to each problem and if you don't know the right strategy then you're going to lose. It doesn't give you a lot of options. You have very basic units, a basic leveling system and a map. There isn't much you can do to modify your army or change the way of the game. It's more like a puzzle game with the UI of battle isle.\n\nI strongly suggest playing through th demo before buying this game. I didn't have the chance as it was a gift. Also, if you're looking to play online it is a ghost town. Even though ASYNC play is incorporated it's still difficult to get a game going.

It's the Dark Souls of Turn-Based Strategy, and even when you have a grasp of all the mechanics it doesn't make the game much easier. There's no difficulty levels either, so if you were planning on scooting through the game on easy mode that won't be possible.\n\nPatience and persistence are key here. I failed the first mission like seven times before I beat it. That can be disheartening. I had to walk away from the keyboard a couple times and let my levels of frustration lower. What kept me from rage quitting was that I could see exactly how I died in each try.\n\nEach failure, gives me data I can use to win, bringing me closer to victory the next time. That's a good choice on the part of the developer.\n\nThere's a few campaigns and some scenario missions along with hotseat and online multiplayer. There's also a built in scenario maker and the community has built dozens of maps, maybe even hundreds. The quality of those maps obviously varies, but there are bound to be a few gems in there somewhere.\n\nI'd recommend this game for people who like a challenge.

New games in this genre are rare, so I gave Battle Worlds: Kronos a shot. Here's what I think of it:\n\nSingleplayer\n-------------\nDon't get fooled by the fact that the campaign only has 13 missions because they're quite long - I took me approximately 40 hours to get through them. That's not even counting the additional official and non-official singleplayer maps. I'd say there's enough value for your money.\nThe first 3 missions aren't that interesting but then they start adding some new twists. In mission 6 for example you only get a few snipers and have to avoid open battles until you "liberated" enough units from depots. There's more than one right way to achieve your goals - In mission 7 I blew my way through a heavily defended base to capture a truck (the target) only to realize that the sea in the middle of the map froze after a few turns, opening up a shortcut... which was then used by the enemy to launch a massive attack while the bulk of my forces were tied up somewhere else.\nIn another mission you have to sit back and try capturing units from two factions fighting each other until you're strong enough to destroy them both.\nSounds difficult? Well, situations like that can get tricky but it's not as hard as the game itself claims to be. I'm not really an expert in this genre but had no problems to get all bonus objectives/achievements on the first try with far less turns than the game expects you to. As long as you don't blindly charge into the usually superior enemy forces, you're fine.\n\nMechanics\n-----------\nUnfortunately, there's relatively little unit variety - Pretty much standard with few surprises. I like that units gain ranks and with them bonuses or new abilities though. A veteran Bandit (light artillery) for example, can get surface-air missiles. I was complaining that there aren't many tactical options like bonuses for encircling enemy units - turns out there are, it's just not explained very well. I was already in mission 10 when I paid attention to the loading screen which tells you about this. I suppose the manual does so too but who's looking at that, right? :D Well, since I didn't need such tactics, it kinda shows that the game isn't that difficult.\nAircraft need to refuel back at a base after a few turns (which is good), but due to their small fuel tanks I find them to be rather useless. You rarely see them in the campaign anyway (2-3 missions), the main focus is on ground combat.\n\nA.I.\n----\nBad. Doesn't seem to understand the rules which becomes obvious when it doesn't utilize units captured from depots. Never seen it using its factories either. It prefers to cheat - reinforcements just appear out of nowhere. Doesn't seem to know the words "tactical retreat" and, even worse, is very prone to "idiot-bait" - sacrifice a low value unit and the AI will happily swarm it, getting in range of your clearly visible artillery or giving you time to get into a better position.\n\nGraphics\n---------\nImho not really important in this genre, but I certainly won't complain that BW:K looks quite nice. No need for me to explain - since it's turn-based, there's not much difference between the screenshots and how it looks like "in motion" ;) What you don't see, is that the animations and effects of units firing and exploding are also not bad either. Everything just "fits" and resembles the look and feel of the old Battle Isle titles. Just don't look too closely at the animation quality and models during the cutscenes - they're quite bad.\n\nMusic/Sound\n-------------\nI play turn-based stuff in windowed mode with sound/music off, so I don't care. Sound assets are ok though, so is the music. The latter gets repetitive quickly however.\n\nMultiplayer\n-----------\nTurn-based games take ages in multiplayer - I never played one. Checked the community though and it's pretty much non-existent. If you like playing online, it'll be hard to find a match.\n\nVerdict\n-------\nI'm really trying to like BW:K and I do have a decent amount of fun it, but with better AI, more interesting units it could've been so much more. As it is, it's not bad, not great (but could've been, which is kinda sad)","November 21, 2015","true","40.5"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

It’s got plenty of gameplay, online features, and quite a learning curve.\n\nI started off the game immediately by playing a live multiplayer match with a friend of mine, as that’s what I do with most strategy games. This may have been a bad idea, as we both had trouble figuring out what to do for the first hour or so of our game. The game plays a lot differently than what I’m used to in any strategy game, with a lot of interesting mechanics that I’ve never seen before in a strategy game.\n\nThe game plays extremely slow in multiplayer. On top of the fact that the game is turn-based, there’s lack of a turn timer for each player, so, basically, each turn can last an infinite amount of time. Each turn is saved server-side, so one can even leave their current game while another player takes their turn. It took us roughly two and a half hours to complete a single game, partly due to the fact that we both were figuring out the game as we played.\n\nThe game looks great, reminded me of Starcraft, the way some of the units and buildings appeared. There’s also a wide array of available units, including my favorite, the hoverboat (which had a proper name, I just cannot recall it. I believe it was “alligator” or “crocodile”).\n\nA few of the game’s mechanics were a bit difficult to grasp, especially the resource collection. It took me quite some time to figure that one out, and this is coming from someone who plays strategy games on an almost-daily basis. Aside from the slight learning curve, the game was quite fun, even more so in singleplayer, due to the length of each skirmish. I do recommend learning more about the game before jumping right in, however.","January 27, 2014","true","2.5"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

Many maps/missions are quite big and long and that's very cool. The gameplay is rather deep but keep it enjoyable for players not fan of pure wargames. There's a great gameplay diversity along the missions of the campaign.\n\nIt's a genre that disappeared many years ago. I don't suggest try first the old classics because they didn't aged well. And there's no real contemporary competitor.\n\nSo a clue is if you like turn based strategy games with an immediate and strong appeal, not too serious, and not too complex but with a good depth, then you should consider this game with attention, it's a great one in that very large category (Civilization, Endless Space, XCOM EU, Heroes of Migh&Magic, King's Bounty The Legend, Dominions 4, Jagged Alliance 2, Age of Wonders, and more).","November 11, 2013","true","137.7"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

Because of the difficulty curve there is the option to call for reinforcements - at the cost of a lowered score on the map. You may have to try a map several times if you do not wish to use the reinforcements. That means you have to sink in a lot of time to get that map right, but it is worth the satisfaction you get from finally getting it right in the end.","November 4, 2013","true","7.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You'r dropped in a "tutorial" scenario that is poorly executed, and almost every unit in the game is immediately playable. There is no buildup. The scenarios are really long and unimaginative.

This game don't make me happy.  I'm probably naturally pushed towards discontent being that I was a kickstarter, but as far as graphic fidelity I was hoping for, at least, something along the lines of Dune 2000 (which recollection serves me none at all when it comes to when it came out but I'll hazard a guess that it was around 2000).  And I was hoping for gameplay depth at least around the level of Dune 2000.  And as a pledgeman, a reach goal was depth around the level of MAX 1.  Forget setting the bar as high as MAX 2.\nAs the project progressed, I learned that there would be no real base building component to the game and worried about my pledge (not that anybody promised it -- I just dreamed it).  It still seemed like the developers had a passion for mechanics so I stayed interested.\nI might be jumping the gun, and I know for a fact that I have gotten pussified as the years have passed, but such a disappointment.  Like combining the worst of a table top tactics game and a pc game.  You get damaged, you just drive over a tile with a wrench icon.  With maps hundreds of tiles across with instant healing and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI?  Just wander, stumble, shoot, lose, memorize the pattern and try to iterate a better plan.  Nothing pretty to distract you from the mindlessness.  A total derth of emergent behavior.  Not my version of fun and a pledge wasted.\nPostface:  I could have tried to get involved, and had I been ignored I'd have a more substantive complaint.  I didn't.  Just a review of the finished product.  May get more involved in Unsung Story?","February 2, 2014","false","2.0"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Wolffstamps/recommended/237470/","Wolffstamps","Wilk [Curator]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Wolffstamps/","233 products in account","Battle World:Kronos review\nThis game is a very hard strategy which has it's pros and cons, although it seems nice at the beggining, that buff will not last for long. So if you're new to this genre, get out. If you're okay with these types of games, you should probably also get out. If you're a master, welcome to where you're life will turn insanely addicted.\nPlease take to mind, this game is Hard, very hard. I just suck at this genre.\n\nGraphics\nThis is a very pretty game with so many different effects and textures. Think of a stategy game made by Square Enix sprinkled with some more playabilty, less fairness (see Gameplay for details). It's nothing new here, move along if you're into some extreme graphics where you can see close ups of everything that's happening.\n\nGameplay\nThe game stated itself to be 100% fair by a developer. Which I could possibly agree with, although not entirely. On the first level there's quite a big number of enemies, and loads of objectives that take you into the feel of this game straight away, but it's just too fast! The game  does not  teach you about any of the units such as Priest (I still do not know what units a Priest can attack, as a sniper unit he should be able to be used as support), leaving the enemy (computer controlled, knows what all of the classes are used for, layout of the map ect) at an upper hand since it has all of the knowledge leaving you needing to fail many, many times in order to win. It's a wierd angle to play at, but it's surely a new one. Fail to succeed, never thought of that. So it's innovative, but because barely anyone is used to this type of playability, it's hard to pick up any speed, or even get past Level 1 if you suck at Strategy games like I do.\n\nHow realistic is the game\nThe answer in short is, not very, but also is quite realistic. Let's take a war, I should be able to know at least a bit about my units that I put into battle if I'm a commander of a squad, so I will not make a mistake of placing a small pistol airpilot who has crashed, against a giant cucumber-man who has a flaming minigun. That would cause me to lose the war since I didn't know my unit was terrible, or that the other sides' was powerful. This is like Dark Souls where I absolutely need the community to help me figure out who does what in the game, without those guys, I would still be at the first level, looking at my first unit and studying it, which would make me learn who is a good and strong overlord unit, but would take too long, it wouldn't even be fun anymore. Yet I still did that.\n\nPros and Cons\nPros:\nGraphics are pretty\nGood for people who enjoy strategies\n\nCons:\nNot very fair\nThe first level is a bit long, while it should just tell me the basics, to let me know what I'm doing, kill a  few  enemies of all types so I'll be able to complete the first mission.\nA bit costly\nI'd like a little more variety in difficulty\n\nOverall\nA fantastic game which made me a lot more skilled in the genre. Get's an easy 7.5/10. Great game if you're a master at Strategies.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group:  Follow Original Curator Group\nCheck out the Original Network Groups.

The reasons were dicussed well enough. I will not repeat them.\n\nThe Dev's response related to this critism suggests, that they do not see any (design) failures on their side and that they are not willing to intoduce corresponding changes. Well, that's ok - its their game and there seems to exist a certain fan base which favours b]their approach . But hence, this will be my conclusion: Deinstall BW:K and discourage my friends from buying/playing it.\n\nBest regards,\npaxSeb","October 9, 2014","false","6.1"," 9 of 26 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","9","26","0","0"
