In fact, it's the same MacGyver-esque plot device that Valve resorted to when they created the Perpetual Testing Initiative story for Portal 2. Mere coincidence????\n\n... Okay, setting aside the fanman sarcasm, Peggle Extreme is really fun, mildly replayable, and worth trying if you're ever... bored, I suppose.

This is an amazing standalone free version of the smashhit Peggle that will get you hooked for hours upon hours even tho its only 10 stages in this  version.

Now's your chance.\n\nFor those who don't know, Peggle is an arcade-style game, by PopCap Games, in which the player shoots balls at pegs littering the screen, the goal being to hit all the orange pegs. It's a very easy-going game, with simple graphics and music. Which is why it's surprising that Peggle Extreme exists.\n\nPeggle Extreme takes the classic Peggle gameplay and juxtaposes it with imagery and sounds from Valve's The Orange Box. It's kinda weird to see such a laid-back game crossing over with the likes of Half-Life 2, Team Fortress 2, and Portal, especially since the music is the same easy-listening cheese found in the original Peggle. But the gameplay remains intact, and it's well worth downloading, since you don't have to pay for it.\n\nIt only comes with 10 levels and one instructor (Bjorn the unicorn), but there are also five challenges that you can try out. It's a pretty short game, but if you're already a fan, or you've never played any game in the series, this is a great little spin-off to get, especially for free.\n\n7 out of 10.","December 9, 2014","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I assumed that it would be something like Glados mocking you, or the unicorn staring at a head crab. But instead I saw background with the Peggle Masters being set on fire! You'd imagine my surprise at the title screen! I actually got scared. I thought you would be able to play as Glados on a Portal themed level, maybe even the offer of cake. But, I seriously can't look past that title screen. Was the gore really necessary? Couldn't you have  the unicorn stand next to a companion cube or the characters be allies rather than intruders. The gameplay is the same as Paggle with the only change being the backgrounds and using Portals for 2 or 3 levels. Anyway, it's worth a try just expect SOME surprises and not an actual team up. More like a cameo apperance. Anyway, thats my 2 cents","December 4, 2014","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/3483/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Peggle is one of those shareware games that were quite a big thing few years ago, with wacky likeable graphic and simple gameplay, all to fit for the tastes of the wide audience of casual gamers (For example, your mom). And Peggle Extreme goes even more wacky, being a free promotional demo-version with levels taking place in universe of Valve's Orange Box games, with unicorn being the only available character. (who has his head being eaten by headcrab at title screen, scaring some part of casual audience away)\n\nIt's a completely free single player game that includes 10 exclusive levels, as been said, as well as hard 5 challenge levels for people who mastered peggle gameplay, as well as duel, with local multiplayer, where players take turns in shooting ball out. Nope, no Internet multiplayer there.\n\nIt should give you a good taste at what Peggle games are about. The gameplay was inspired by Pachinko games and been made just a bit more skill-based, while still having to guess where the ball will ricochet off. You take control of the cannon on top of screen and shoot uncontrollable ball in direction you choose, after which you are left hoping to get lucky to hit more orange pegs than just one.  You still can try to measure the timing, to get lucky to have your ball fall into basket, giving it back for free, or get one more ball by scoring a as many pegs and bonuses as possible. Out of all the pegs, orange ones, that are randomly chosen each time, are the only ones that you are required to hit to beat the level.\n\nGraphics are random simple 2D cuteness and just randomness, and music is forgetable, aside from use of classic here and there.\n\nAlso, I don't think that it uses any of Steam features, I couldn't even bring up the Steam Overlay. Good thing this game is alt+tab friendly.\n\nPersonally, I think that this game is too much based on luck/guessing/measuring-like-a-robot, but since it's free, you should try it and decide for yourself.","January 5, 2014","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not helping matters is this free ten-level version, Peggle Extreme, released in 2007 to promote both Peggle and The Orange Box.  Previously, only people who purchased The Orange Box had access to Extreme, but now this darkly hilarious crossover on the happy-go-lucky world of Peggle is free for everyone.\n\nAnd if that's not enough for you, they also made a free version of Peggle to promote World of Warcraft (specifically, Wrath of the Lich King).

This version does not hold as many levels as Peggle Deluxe offers but the replayability more than makes up for it. This is a game that can easily be played for a few minutes on the backburner while other tasks take the forefront of your attention. The graphical options are substandard, while the control in gameplay is top-notch. Overall, this is a worthy addition to anyone's library if you're looking for a game to take your attention for a bit.","May 4","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
