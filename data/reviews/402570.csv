"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mal3diction/recommended/402570/","mal3diction","Sobriquet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mal3diction/","89 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nA familiar game yet completely unique\nI have over 7,000 hours of Dota2 played. I invested a fair amount of time in Heroes of Newerth before that and Heroes of the Storm since. And while this game is probably not an ARTS/MOBA, it has a lot of the elements that drew me to the genre.\n\nDespite being turn based the game never feels slow. All players share the same 20 seconds to decide what they want to do for that turn, which keeps the pacing sharp and rewards quick decision making. It is long enough to remove the 'twitch reflexes' aspect from other games, which is a bonus for me as I'm approaching gamer's old age.\n\nThe controls are simple and the mechanics are intuitive. As long as you understand that each phase (Prep, Dash, Blast, Move) is simultaneous within itself it's pretty easy to grasp why a dead freelancer is still able to get off that monster full-team ultimate.\n\nBut like the simplicity of chess, it's just a framework to outplay your opponents. The game is only as easy as the enemy team makes it. That 6-hp Lockwood is definitely going to dash and stay alive, right? So your entire team covers places he can jump to and secure the kill. But he just stands there and shoots you all for massive damage. Mind games and bluffing are front and center in Atlas Reactor and to me that's the core of a competitive game.\n\n\ntl;dr\nPros\n-Crisp pacing within a turn based context\n-Simple controls and intuitive mechanics\n-Complex gameplay that heavily features mind games\n-Very friendly community (for now, best to assume this will diminish as the game grows)\n-Reflexes are irrelevant, but quick decision making is key\n-As far from p2w as you can possibly get\n\nCons\n-Unoptimized in beta (This will undoubtably change as the game moves towards release but I would be remiss to not mention it)\n\n-Plays much better with voice chat, which requires a third-party client like the official Discord server found here[discord.gg]\n\n-Game is very much geared toward 4-stacks. Solo queue can be extremely chaotic, so unless you use the Discord server to find people or just collect players as you go the experience can be pretty hit-or-miss.\n\nIn light of this, my in game tag is mal3diction#5080. If anyone wants to try out the game and wants some company, I'd love to hang out with new players and help shield you from YOLO queue!","May 14","true","151.5"," 62 of 76 people (82%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","82","62","76","7","0"

That's about the longest I've gone without playing a match since servers were last down before the closed beta. Every day is a struggle now. Do I take care of my dog? Do I actually get some work done and make some money? Do I remember to eat more than once a day? Barely.\n\nSince the alpha sneak peek in February I've played somewhere around 1200 matches, and it's never enough. My team won a tournament, and the devs gave us a bunch of free credits. We spent them on a hotel for a few nights so we wouldn't have to play in the streets. I'm always chasing the next high. I dream in prep, dash, blast, and movement phases. The only friends I have any more are the junkies I get my fix with every day in game.\n\nI'm getting the shakes.\n\nEverything hurts.\n\nI, uh, I can't do this any more.\n\nI have to go play now.\n\n10/10.","May 14","true","344.7"," 89 of 124 people (72%) found this review helpful 67 people found this review funny","72","89","124","67","4"

Solid new way of playing a hero based PVP game due to the turn based tactics. It plays like what I imagine Chewbacca and C-3PO were playing on the falcon. Some sort of futuristic chess, where guessing your opponents actions is just as important as deciding your own. This is not a moba. This is not a shooter. This is not like other games you have played.\n\nAll characters come with purchase of the game. Several other titles have taken this model because players dont want to grind to try all the different characters. This may turn some off who were expecting the original idea of a F2P and microtransaction model. however for the price of 2 characters you can now own them all. then any earned currency can be used on loot (cosmetics).\n\nThere is no leveling. All characters are what they are from the start of the match. Every ability on every character can be modified in multiple ways to create a playstyle that caters to each individual. 4v4 battles , First to 5 kills.\n\nI really enjoy this game, and hope it catches on due to the great ideas the devs are bringing. Put aside your prior judgements of Trion and give this a real chance. I did, and got waaay more than i was expecting.\n\nGreat job guys. keep it up.","May 14","true","5.3"," 35 of 43 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","35","43","0","0"

Although it can be compared to other "arena style" games like DOTA and League, I feel as though Atlas is a genre all of its own, mixing arena battle with a turn-based combat very XCOMesque.\n\nThe game currently has 16 "Freelancers" varying from support, to melee/tank "frontliners" and DPS "firepower". Each character has 5 unique abilities. Each ability falls under one of three types; prep, dash and blast. These types (Plus Move) take up the segments of a turn, each taking place during the turn in sequence. Prep abilities trigger first, followed by dash abilities or those abilities that allow your character to do a quick move on the board. The blast phase is the main combat phase that characters dish out their damage. Regardless of how much damage you have taken in the turn, every character gets to contribute to the turn meaning everyone uses their ability regardless of when in the turn they die. As the game progresses from turn to turn, characters battle each other for a 5 kill score with the winners coming out on top (and netting more xp and ELO, the ranking points system)\n\nAccount progression allows characters to earn ISO to purchase new character unlocks like skins, taunts, and special talent changes to abilities. The Season game mode allows you to earn loot boxes for the crafting minigame where you can make XP boosts (GG boosts) new background banners, titles and skins.\n\nOverall the game, being in Beta, has room to grow. The foundation for a fun, competitive arena style game has opened up new directions for a world dominated by MOBA and I feel that Atlas, although NOT A MOBA has a place at the table to represent a unique and challenging experience for those familiar to them.","May 14","true","49.1"," 30 of 35 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","30","35","0","1"

Also played while it wasn't on steam, never took more than a min to find a match also without free weekend.\nThey have just changed business model from f2p to b2p. This means ingame, no freelancer (hero) unlocks or unfair boosts only skins/cosmetics,chat emotes.\nMost of the customization content is unlockable with progress what makes every player different and easy to determine their progress (different: banner,title,character color or ability effect).\n\nIts a turnbased multyplayer strategy game. The game is set two 4 player team against each other and the team who scores 5 kills within 20 combat rounds wins or who has the most after 20 rounds, if they have the same amount of kills the game keep going until one of the team don't have more kills. Every character has unique playstyle,skills/abilityes and they fit well for different combat situations. Its clearly a mind game with nice actions.\n\nI miss a bit of content!\nThere is 16 playable character atm its more than enough to find a playstyle for your self, but i would like to have a "bit" more option.(just a few more not a 100+1)\nFew maps (3). The gameplay is uniuque that makes it enjoyable even after 100 game. Well i know this part sounds wierd but this is interesting because every person acts differently they form different situations and because of this you rotate on the map and you use the same obstacle,wall or corner in a different way fitting to the situation what makes every game different also on the same map.\nYet its enough for me but i hope there will be more in the future.\nNo single player only co-op vs ai or with full ai. A campaing would be nice, but there isn't!\n\nOverall: I like the game sofar i hope they will add more content in the future, it has the potential to become a great game.\nThis is my opinion/experience, every person has different taste if u dont like it i can accept it i will still :heart: this game.","May 14","true","65.3"," 40 of 53 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","40","53","2","2"

The current competitive mode is a 4v4 death-match style arena, with the winner being first to five kills or most kills after 20 turns.\n\nThe concept itself is new and refreshing, and it provides a new and unique alternative to the many moba-like games that are emerging. It is infinitely more cerebral than existing mobas, and the depth of the strategy is far better than any existing MOBA game.\n\nThe game recently switching from a F2P model to a B2P model, which is clear from some of the current designs. However, this is an early access game that only very recently exited alpha stages. The game and model are evolving rapidly, and the developers make a point to interact with the community on a daily basis, going so far as supporting the "official" reddit discord server. A large portion of the changes to the game have come directly from the suggestions of the community. It's rare to see this level of community engagement, even in an early access game. The only company I can think of in recent history that has committed to this level of interaction with the community is Gazillion, with Marvel Heroes.\n\nAs far as the game itself, I have thoroughly enjoyed it. The matches are quick, prediction the enemies' actions is incredibly rewarding, and a single mistake can be catastrophic. Every action  you take and every choice you make plays a critical roll in your success or failure.","May 14","true","114.2"," 35 of 45 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","35","45","3","0"

I personally haven't played very much yet but the time I spent playing during the free weekend thus far has been quite enjoyable. If you are familiar with mobas at all, it has a similar concept in that you will pick a freelancer (hero/champ/etc) and match up with 3 other players to face another team of 4. Combat is ruled by phases, creating oppurtunities to juke, attack, shield, heal, buff and so on. It has a nice feel to it, the tutorial is a little bland but don't give up on it too quick. There is also customization options for each freelancer to give it more of a personal feel without feeling overpowered/underpowered. The game has potential I feel, I'd say give it a shot if its on a free weekend and even if not and you're into tactical gameplay just go on and purchase it.

There's so much deep strategy there, and when everyone's acting in concert it's a beautiful thing. It feels a lot like a MOBA in that sense - each character can do a short list of things, and it's everyone's job to make sure the team is greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nIt's in Early Access for a reason, tho - they do need to work on some polish, and need ways to communicate ideas clearly without typing (because seriously, that time limit?

Each character has skills that activate at certain phases. While the actions of each phase are played out sequentially, they are done at the same time (if one character shoots another dead in Blast, the other character's Blast action still goes off). An action done in a previous phase can affect one done in a later phase (if one character stuns another the Blast phase, the other character's Run action doesn't occur). All choices are made during the initial Decision Phase (allied choices are normally shown). The decision phase has a 20 seconds timer (normally enough to think out choices, without becoming irritating to quick-thinkers).\n\nThis creates a game where success relies on predicting your opponent, cooperating with your team, and tracking you opponent's abilities are essential to success.\n\nWhile the Tutorial explains the basics, it seemed lacking in explaining certain mechanics. It's recommended that a few Practice/AI games be played to gain familiarity.\n\nSo far, I haven't run into any major bugs.","May 14","true","4.1"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","22","25","0","0"

It's a 4v4 team-based, tactics XCOM/chess game. It stresses team work and communication, sometimes when you play with newbies or randoms it can be infuriating, but when you operate well as a squad it's so satisfying. Each game lasts 20ish minutes depending on if the Great Wall of Rampart plays lulz. Graphics were recently optimized even for crappy toaster laptops like the one I have kekeke\n\nWhen people hear Trion, they run for the hills, but this is a well thought-out and executed game. Some people were skeptical for it transitioning from Free-to-Play to Buy for $20 (you receive every Freelancer/Hero forever, I believe this beats MOBAS in that you don't have to grind a ton to get a new hero, it also improved queue times as there cannot be dupicate heroes on a team). But I don't believe there are many $20 games on Steam that even come close to this. This product is more than deserving of the price tag. And it's completely skill based, no Pay to Win BS here.

If you enjoy turn-based games like X-COM, and team based games similar to MOBAs this is definitely the game for you. With 20 seconds per turn to input abilities and movement, it really feels much more urgent than a normal turn based game where you have all the time you need to plan out your strategy. And don't let my in-game time fool you, I've been playing since the Alpha Sneak Peek, and they only just got added to Steam.\n\nThe fact that it's buy to play should not deter you. It's a one-time fee to unlock every character in the game forever, similar to Smite, but you can unlock all of the additional content in the game itself. You never have to pay another cent unless you want to get the skins, taunts, and loot crates faster.\n\nYou'll also see the devs in the game, and often. I don't think I've ever encountered devs in other games that just enjoy playing their own game with whoever they get matched with. They even run impromptu "Dev Killer" events that give out special titles to those who win or lose (though you have to be willing to wear the losing one first).\n\nThis is just a super fun game, and once you find a group of people that you enjoy playing with, it only gets better.

For the longest time my guilty pleasure has been League of Legends, and other than the occasional Visual Novels and incredibly interesting (but also short length) puzzle adventure games, there are tens of games that I never played more than a few minutes/hours.\n\nThen came Atlas Reactor. I was a closed alpha tester then; having gotten a key from stream TheBlueMuzzy (Now AR's Community Manager, bless him) and decided that it looked to really fit my taste. To my surprise and delight, it verily did. Atlas Reactor is a Multiplayer Online Board Action (MOBA - But NOT that MOBA) featuring 4v4 simultaneous turn-based matches with a simple yet unbelievably addictive win condition - get 5 kills before 20 turns, or score the highest amount of kills.\n\nDuring closed alpha its core gameplay has already been largely completed; a major reason why it was an instant love that I've sunk roughly 30-40 hours total into the game. Moreover, it has witty and funny characters such as the slightly insane Zuki (like seriously, for a time I couldn't match Tutorial Zuki with Terrorist Zuki in my head because Tutorial Zuki was actually sane), baby powder Quark, cigarette protagonist Lockwood (for god's love devs, PLEASE do not remove this cigar), OP b*itch Grey (at the time she can deal 600+ damage minimum EVERY GAME even in the hands of a newbie), boulder Rampart (he was so useless then he's like a mobile square of full cover), astronaut Garrison (c'mon, he totally looks like one), troll Grem, super adorable PuP (with 180 max HP then... good days), super standard healer Aurora, Big Bro Titus-Whose-Dash-Was-Better-Then-DEV-WHY-WHY-WHY, infinite healing Rask, Easy-to-die, hard-to-master Asana, and of course, my absolute favorite and eternal love, Nix. Even if the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s nerfed you, THEY STILL WON'T STOP US FROM 800 DAMAGE THE ♥♥♥♥ OUT OF OUR ENEMIES CORPSES, RIGHT LOVE?\n\nOh. Right, I totally forgot about that one completely insignificant and forgettable Free - does he even count as a Freelancer? Random Villager A will be a better name, right? - Helios-helios-elios-lios-os-os... also the dude who copyrights his jokes. He's so lame it's hilarious. More lines please, devs! Just so we can soak in his infinite self-depreciation and feel eternally warm on the inside!\n\nYep, the characters are the 2nd reason why I love AR so much. It's funny, but this is one game that you can replay the same maps 100+ times and not feel bored with it, kind of like how people spent years on Summoner's Rift and still rage at their teammates. The magic is here. Right now the store's a bit of a mess because the devs can't seem to decide what should be made in-game currency purchasable (NOTE: IT SHOULD BE 95% OF EVERYTHING, BECAUSE THE GAME'S MINIMUM $30 NOW) and whatnot, but there's no reason to believe that it can't be sorted out. Between the lines and dots of deception you kill your enemies to entertain Trusts and hope that one day, you can master your own destiny...","May 15","true","191.6"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shadom/recommended/402570/","shadom","Shadom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shadom/","217 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAn honest review of Atlas Reactor.\n__________________________\n\n*As a heads up, I do not have the game installed on through Steam, I have it installed through Glyph. I played the game since it was in its Pre-Alpha stages of development and have continued played since.*\n\n** PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT ATLAS REACTOR IS STILL IN EARLY ACCESS/BETA DEVELOPMENT, THERE ARE FEATURES WHICH STILL NEED TO BE ADDED TO THE AND/OR FINE TUNED. ATLAS REACTOR IS NOT A FINSHED PRODUCT YET! **\n\nAtlas Reactor, an easy to pick up and understand group turn-based MOBA with an interesting and deep depth of strategy to the game.\n__________________________\n\nAtlas Reactor is an interesting take on the MOBA genre, it plays likes a turn-base strategy game while also having the competiveness of similar MOBAs like League of Legends and DOTA 2.  In Atlas Reactor, you control a single character called a Freelancer with in a team of 3 other Freelancers. Each Freelancer have their own unique abilities and ways of playing. The goal of is to beat your enemy teem through one of these win condition; first team to 5 kills (Kills are points on the scoreboard) wins or the team with the most kills by the end of turn 20 wins. A game in Atlas Reactor will only last for 20 turns unless the score is tied by turn 20, if that happens than the game goes into an overtime/sudden death. The first team to break the tie score wins. While in Overtime/Sudden Death, a game can go on past turn 20 (I have had matches which have lasted till turn 30+ before).\n\nAtlas Reactor plays at a very timely pace for all players, but that doesn’t necessarily mean all players play at the same pace. For some players, the games pacing may be to slow for them or way to fast when they first start playing the game. Matches tend to be played in a similar way that chess is played, you are meant to analyze what your opponent is doing to figure out your best way to outsmart them while your opponent does the same thing to you, the biggest difference is that you only control 1 piece which can perform multiple action in the game and you must cooperate with 3 other players (this can be rather rough to do since not everyone is going to think the same way, but that is the of a competitive MOBA). Because of this, the game will likely be harder for some players to pick up and understand than compared to others who have a “knack” for games like this.\n\nThough Atlas Reactor is turn-base, combat is done simultaneously based on the phase of combat. This means all Prep abilities activate during the prep phase, all Dash abilities activate in the dash phase, all blast abilities activate in the blast phase, and all movement is done at the end of the blast phase.\n___________________________\n\nPros and Cons of Atlas Reactor\n\n+Pros+\n+ Unique Freelancers\n+ Good Win Conditions\n+ Simple to pick up with deep strategy\n+ Fairly easy gameplay with a small introductory learning curve.\n+ All Freelancers are free forever!\n+ The only Payed unlockables are purely cosmetic, no Pay2Win advantages.\n+ Able to unlock unique cosmetic content and some purchasable content through crafting in steading of paying for    it\n\n-Cons-\n- The game may be more difficult for some players to understand\n- The game has glitches are problems within matches and UI (the game is in EA/Beta still)\n- Match fluidity varies between slow and fast (matters on how players play the game)\n- Some in game information may be hard to pick up on (Ability Telegraphs)\n- Match experience in dependent on how players play and how team comps are made (a bad experience while playing Atlas Reactor may be cause of people pick characters that they just want to try without knowing how to play them).\n- The games learning curve will very based on a players experience with MOBAs and Turn-Based strategy games.\n___________________________\n\nHere is a quick rundown on why this game is a game you are paying for now and not using the F2P model. Atlas Reactor was originally meant to be a Free 2 Play game, its consumer model with originally designed with that in mind and a lot of the games Alpha/Beta players played the game in its F2P model, but there was an issue with it, the game ended up being rather frustrating to play and develop because you needed really grind a lot of hours to unlock a freelancer(s), a lot of the games development was being used to balance and manage a micro transaction method that was surrounded by people purchasing Freelancers. It clashed with a lot of the games fun dynamics because it would stop players from experiencing the game that other who had all the Freelancers unlocked would experience, this also would cause a problem for upcoming features such as Ranked mode. So, in order to fix this problem, the Atlas Reactor development team decided to go from a F2P model to a buy once and play for ever model in order to keep players on even footing and so everyone is capable of having a good experience in the game overall.\n\nThis change didn’t settle well with me at first, I wasn’t full against it, but I knew that it would have quite a backlash when it came down to people getting interested in the game, a lot of players will immediately disregard the game and not give it a chance because you would need to either play during a free weekend or pay for it. And for now that can be quite a bit of an issue since the game is still being developed and is rather bare bones still, it lacks content… but it will be added more Freelancers and maps will come out as the game gets more developed. So, the game may simply not be interesting enough for people want warrant spending 20 bucks on it… but in the future it will get there.\n","May 14","true","8.0"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","18","22","0","2"

The plays you can make, the mindgames you can pull, and the epic combos you can get off really comes together great.\n\nAnother thing I like is how active the developers are in the community! They're always on discord with us to talk or answer questions, they frequently hold events to face the devs (Who are actually good at the game!) To get special titles depending on if you win or lose!

This game's actually alright. It's not bad, it fits into a niche and it's fresh and interesting in a way that's presented as simple enough to dive into.\n\nIt's one of them competitive team hero-based games except it's turn based strategy combat and the commands are treated as simultaneous (they play sequentially for clarity, if you 'die' to a move you will continue with your orders until the move phase including things that heal you to take you out of death range) and are split into four stages: Prep, Dash, Blast, and then regular moving. And it all plays out into this nicely balanced thing with potential for team synergy (moves are very reliant on skill-shot aiming and requiring positioning co-ordination) and mind games (reading a dash attack by pointing your blast attack in the direction you think they'll try to dodge, etc.).\n\nCharacters aren't amazing but it's not like Paladins or Paragon where they're trying to make serious fantasy characters just like every other hero game there is to see. Here they slap a cool design and a kit together, we don't worry about the plot details, and it generally doesn't bother us. Characters are expressive and rarely follow any kind of well-worn templates; looking at the cast for the first time was very "Whoa hang on what am I looking at?" which spun around into being refreshing. Not strong, but not drab, boring, or typical either.\n\nProgression's a little weird. Characters have pick-and-choose augments to abilities which are super easy to acquire but they're worth different amounts of points and you have to remove some from others depending on how expensive the mod you want is and it's not something you can see until you're hit by it in combat either. And it's not like I want to play around with it, usually the default mods are good enough and suit what I think I need.\n\nWas easy enough to learn and start playing but I've got a lot of picking up and studying to do if I'm to find out how I can improve, it's not apparent from gameplay alone where you go wrong because taking damage and eventually dying is just par for the course since lining up shots is always putting you in harms way one way or another and you only have so many escape plans. That last one's not a flaw of the game design, having difficulty getting better is just a consequence of it in some way.","May 14","true","21.0"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

There's an extensive list of heroes, which each fit into different roles, and you choose one to play. You're matched up into a team of four (or you can gather a group of friends to build a team of your own), and face off against an opposing team. Everybody has 20 seconds to enter their moves simultanious, and then you watch how they all resolve. The first team to get 5 kills wins.\n\nThe 20 second time limit and simultanious turn resolution keeps everything moving quickly despite being turn-based. It averages maybe 40 seconds total per turn, with no more than 20 turns per match. The 20 seconds is enough to keep you on your toes, but is almost always enough time if you're paying attention and know your powers.\n\nOne of the places where it breaks from most MOBAs is that it's very easy to learn all your powers and customization options. Every character has 5 powers, and each power has a set of modifers that can be applied to them to tweak them to your play style. These tweaks are applied between matches, so you have time to read them and choose properly, and when you initially pick a character is generally has some pretty reasonable defaults if you just want to jump into the game. You can also choose three extra powers, called "catalysts", which can be used once per match. The selection of available catalysts are the same for all characters. All of this together provides just enough customization to be interesting, while not being overwhelming.\n\nThe tactical system during a game is also brilliant. The turn is divided into 4 phases: prep, dash, attack and move. Every power triggers on one of the first three phases. Prep powers tend to be buffs or traps (or sometimes debuffs). Dash powers tend to be powers that involve some amount of special movement. Attack phase powers can be anything, but are most often attacks. The movement phase is when you do movement.\n\nThis means much of the tactics is about predicting what the enemy will do. For instance, if you choose an attack power on them, and they dash out of the attack's area, the attack will miss. Unless you can correctly predict where they're dashing to, and attack that position instead. Or, you can use a prep power to lay down a trap that they'll hit with their dash. So much of playing this game effective is getting into the mind of your opponent and guessing what they'll do.\n\nThis is honestly one of the most solid competitive multiplayer games I've ever played. Highly recommended.","May 30","true","0.3"," 23 of 32 people (72%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","72","23","32","5","0"

The simultanious turn mechanic is just what I was looking for in a MOBA.\n\nIt's an awesome value any way you purchase it. Other games of this style are pay to win not Atlas Reactor  .. Although  I went all in and paid $100 for all of the cosmetic things because I love it and the art so much you could get an amazing game for $20 with all of the Freelancers unlocked forever.\n\nThese crazy reviews about "I couldn't even get through the tutorial" and Blah blah blah Trion..  This is a solid game don't pay them any mind.  The game gets so much better the longer you play it which is awesome.\n\nBuy it and come play..","May 14","true","67.7"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

At first glance it might seem similar if you ignore ALL the information about the game. Fortunately, it was an entirely different game, and has become one of my absolute favorite surprises in a long time.\n\nThis is a turn based tactics competitive strategy game. First to five kills, 4v4, but you can make custom games which change up that formula. This a purely PVP game, with no PVE aspect (unless you play with bots). You move on a grid and on each turn you have twenty seconds to decide what to do. Within that time frame, you can see your team mate\'s moves but not the enemies. After the twenty seconds, all turns play simultaneously in a specific order of operations. It ends up playing like a very animated game of chess. Your whole team may plan to attack one person, but before the attack phase is the dash phase, and if that enemy dashes all your teams attacks will still play out, each one missing the shot. Which could place them in a bad spot, or maybe another enemy accidentally dashes into someones line of fire and gets killed.\n\nThe strategy of the game is not the abilities or perfectly placed shots, but correctly guessing your opponents next move or two. This is not a twitch game, which is refreshing. I'm not against twitch games. I've played those my entire life and they are my favorite genre. But this is a nice change of pace. Seeing your team mate's choreographed moves executed as planned and out-smarting the entire team is one of the best experiences I've had in a competitive game in a long time.\n\nI cannot get enough of this game even in this state and I sincerely hope it does well once it comes out.  It needs more players. No pay to win. Microtransactions are only for cosmetics and taunts. Free updates and characters for everyone. This scratches an itch I never knew existed.","May 31","true","53.3"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","17","22","0","0"

(My Steam key was given to me by Trion, but that's because I already owned Atlas Reactor.)\n\nAtlas Reactor takes the turn-based gameplay of XCOM and throws it into a team arena, and tops it all off with a colorful, cyberpunk world.\n\nIf you like strategy games, you'll probably like this. Although it does still require you to be quick-thinking with time limits, but even post-surgery I was able to play without stressing (I didn't do well, but that's to be expected on all those meds).\n\nAs its still beta/early access, there's only 3 maps and 16 characters, only one game mode and no ranked play yet, but the gameplay is so solid that I'm loving it in spite of the option limitations.\n\nEach character has their strengths and are all distinct from each other, with customization on secondary features on their abilities to make them play the way you want - and no one combination seems to be the best for anyone. There's no real team composition meta, either- sure, 1 frontliner, 2 firepower, and a support might seem optimal, but I've won games as and lost games to things like 3 frontliners + 1 support, or 3 supports + 1 firepower. So every match is going to play out uniquely.\n\nThere's also no RNG to get angry over. Abilities do fixed damage, moves happen in certain phases, all there is is your skill and ability to predict what the other team is doing, and communicate with your team on what to do.","May 14","true","63.5"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

Half the time yelling at your friend to click "turn done!" while they ponder out the best move. In this game you only have one character to take care of and a small set of actions but you have to figure it out what to do in 20 seconds.\n\nBig team fights and coordination happen all the time, but because they run in 20 second steps, they don't feel rushed or chaotic. Position and tactics are everything instead of reaction time or APM.\n\nWith the buy to play model, it has the advantages of Dota 2 over League of Legends in that you don't have to risk spending $10 per freelancer for someone you might never be able to play. One time $30 (or less if it's on sale) and you get to mess around with the full roster and find those characters you like best, not the ones that just happen to be available.\n\nIt may not be your game, but check it out on a free weekend.

Buy this game.\nNot looking for that? This might not be your speed.\nShould you give this game a try if you have the option to? Absolutely.\n\nAs a player that has been playing this game since its Open Alpha I feel I can say that Atlas Reactor is a very unique turn-based MOBA that really sets itself apart from any other games in the MOBA genre. If you don't like turn-based combat then you should probably resume browsing for other games on Steam as this is not the game for you. With it's unique cast of characters a new player will be able to find someone that fits their playstyle. Healer (Support), Tank (Frontline), DPS (Firepower) this game has it all. From a happy-go-lucky ball of nuclear energy to a Cold Blooded shotgun totting killer, this game covers a whole spectrum of personalities that add to the fun.\n\nThe gameplay at it's core consists of 4 phases: Decision, Prep, Dash, and Blast. In this order in game it allows for many situations full of outplays that will seperate the skilled from the average. This makes the game fun as you can watch yourself grown and you can learn a lot from one match if you're paying attention. The gameplay never feels repetitive as every game allows for different team combinations and different decisions to change the experience.\n\nThe only problems right now is the small playerbase and the fact that queueing solo is not the best way to have a great experience. The queue times can be a bit long depending on the time you choose to play because of the smaller playerbase, but even then they aren't that long. I've never had a queue longer than 5 minutes. Queuing as a 4 man is easily the most enjoyable way to play this game which is a shame, but it's expected. Friends always make games better. Now if you don't have anyone in specific to play with you can join this  Discord [discordapp.com] and find people in the community to play with!\n\nThe game is definitely worth a try and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a turn-based experience.\n\nIf you want a more indepth look at the game outside of watching streams you can read  this [kbmod.com] article that I wrote about over 2 weeks ago that is a first look at Atlas Reactor. A few things have changed since then, but they don't make the article null.","May 15","true","10.7"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

Outwit your opponent in the Decision phase where you choose your actions, and watch the results play out in the Resolution phase. The controls might be abit hard to grasp at the start, but hey, this game was made by intellectuals, for intellectuals.\n\nIf you're looking for a game that will put your decision and skill making to the test, while delivering insane fun with it, Atlas Reactor is the game for you.

I started playing in alpha and have continued to love playing the game everyday.\n\nThe hardest part of the game is to understand what each "freelancer" can do. (Now that all the characters are avaliable to play from the start, it is much easier to play a character for a few games to understand their abilities better so you can anticipate their next move during the game) Honestly, there is nothing better than predicting your opponents next move and winning the game because of your prediction.\n\nThe strategy and fast pace action keeps me on the edge of my seat. Even as the game time goes on, the kill count goes up (first to 5) and I can feel my nerves raising hoping I made the right choice as the turn undfolds.\n\nIf you want a game that can be different every time you play it, in terms of strategy and team work, Atlas Reactor is for you.

Sure you can play with friends in many games but one that takes it so much deeper in an arena vs other players and not bots is amazing. Sure it makes you mess up from time to time having only 20 sec to react, but that's the beauty of playing games like this.\n\nSure I lost, much in the start, it's to be expected when you try something new. Everything was new to me having no experience with turn based strategy like this one, and it's probably for many more. It was something new, a new element that I've not had to experience against other players and it was such a surge once you got a hang of it, and challenging once other's did too.\n\nMany people compare it to games it has nothing to do with, I can see why, sure it seems maybe a bit like overwatch in some design elements but tonnes of other games does too, it has some elements of mobas but not as much as i'd ever compare it to Dota or LoL, and the same mechanic of turn based startegy all plying out at the same like xcom, but it's this mix that makes it unique and even more so for being an early access.\n\nFor me this game is samazing, it's something different yet familiar and having an already wide variety of abilities I belive it will turn out great if more people would get to try it, spread it to more places, letting there be more free time for testing without buying it.\n\nToo be honest I tried this game because it seemed like owerwatch and the wait for it was getting on me, and this game have been so amazing that the urge for other games wait have gone down and the urge for this game's development high.","May 14","true","29.2"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/moriak/recommended/402570/","moriak","moriak","http://steamcommunity.com/id/moriak/","305 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game is a lot of fun.\n\nIf you would like to take a break from the fast-paced click-fest action of DOTA-like MOBAs, RTSs, FPSs, etc., if you're getting older and your reaction times aren't what they used to be, if you're having health issues (e.g. wrist injury) or you just enjoy the tactical side of turn-based games you should give this game a shot.\n\nNow, it is not a "true" turn-based game in a sense that opponents take turns. In AR each turn is simultaneous. Each turn plays out in 2 phases (or modes as they call them) - Decision mode and Resolution mode and these 2 phases happen to both teams at the same time.\n\nFreelancers, as the heroes are called in AR, have 4 standard abilities (with at least one ability that has no cooldown) and an ultimate ability that can be used when your Energy reaches 100. Energy is gained from landing your abilites, passively each turn and you can also get a buff called Energized which increases Energy gain.\n\nThe turns play out in two phases (modes) as I have mentioned before.\n\nDecision mode - in this phase the players (on both teams) have 20 seconds to plan their actions for the turn. Each turn you can use one ability and move a short distance or you can use no ability and move twice the distance. There are also some "free action" abilities which can be used together with a standard ability. Each ability belongs to one of the three ability categories - Prep, Dash or Blast. This determines when exactly the ability will be used during the Resolution mode. After 20 seconds the next phase begins.\n\nResolution mode - in this phase the planned abilities from Decision mode play out in a specific order - Prep, Dash, Blast and finally move.\n\nPrep abilities are mostly heals, buffs, debuffs, traps, etc. and are the first abilities used in this phase.\n\nDash abilities allow your freelancer to reposition before the Blast phase if you are in a bad spot and want to avoid incoming damage or you just want to get into a better position for the next turn. Some Dash abilities also deal damage. Not every freelancer has a dash ability.\n\nBlast abilities are used last and are mostly damage with some of them also having a debuff (knockback, slow, etc.).\n\nAfter all the abilites are used the freelancers execute their planned movement (unless they were crowd controlled) and the next turn begins with the Decision mode.\n\nOn top of their abilities each freelancer has access to three Catalysts - think League of Legends' summoner spells (not exactly but good enough for comparison). Catalysts are picked before the match and each player can choose only one Catalyst from each ability category - Prep (3), Dash (3) and Blast (2) - number in brackets indicates the amount of Catalysts to choose from. All players have access to the same pool of Catalysts and Catalysts are single use only. Catalysts' effects include buffs, teleports, heal over time or cooldown reduction. Some Catalysts are "free action" and can be used together with standard abilities, however, you can only use one Catalyst each turn (even if you have multiple "free action" Catalysts).\n\nYou can play the game Solo (with bots as teammates and opponents), Co-op (with players as teammates and bots as opponents) or Versus (PvP). I can't give any feedback on matchmaking but the queue times are fine IMO.\n\nSo far there is one game mode - team deathmatch. The match is limited to 20 turns and whichever team scores 5 kills or has more kills than the other team at 20 turns will win the match. If the score is tied then there is a sudden death mode which ends when one team has more kills than the other team at the end of a turn. If you die during the match you will have to sit one turn out and you will be respawned the next turn. Ability cooldowns and ultimate charge persist through death.\n\nMaps are rectangular in shape with various obstacles that can be used to break line of sight or to gain cover which reduces damage received from some abilities. There are also zones which make your freelancer invisible to the opponents (brush), however, if you use any ability while in this zone the zone becomes ineffective for one turn. There are also spawn points for "buff orbs" which grant various benefits when picked up.\n\nThere is a cash shop in the game which turns a lot of people off, however, there's no real advantage that you can gain by spending RL money (AKA P2W). In the shop you can buy skins, taunts, boosts and loot "chests". Taunts and "chests" can also be purchased with in-game currency which you receive for finishing matches and doing contracts (daily quests). Boosts can also be crafted (crafting is too early in development so I won't be going further into details).\n\nRegarding the development team and such, I realize Trion does not have the best track record but this game is quite rare and I'm really enjoing it so I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. The devs also seem to be quite responsive to feedback.\n\nPS: I am in closed beta and and I don't use Steam to launch the game","May 16","true","0.3"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

This is a unique MOBA experience. It's turn based, but very tactical and team synergy can be amazing. With well coordinated teamwork you can set up and destroy one of your opponents in 1-2 turns. With the four phases, you have so much more to think about in terms of what you do and when you do it. You find yourself wondering what the opponent is going to do non-stop throughout the game. You often have to predict what the will opponents will do, while at the same time watching what your teammates are doing and selecing your own actions; all in one minute!\n\nIt's paced well, and matches don't last longer than 15-20 minutes on average. For a game in early release it feels finished, despite not having a lot of content. I guess the only downside to me is there is one game mode, and a limited number of charatcers. You end up facing the same character as yourself very often, but they already have the next lancer schedule for arrival so it's going to grow quickly.\n\nFor $20 this game is worth it, and as it continues to grow it's only going to get better.","May 21","true","102.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

The gameplay is a hero-based, 4 vs 4, turn-based combat. Everyone inputs their moves, having 20 seconds to do so. Then, all the actions resolve simultaneously, according to a clearly defined priority list. So it is possible to dodge an attack that you know is coming, but if your opponent predicts your dodge, he can attack instead the new location you are moving to.  The maps are well made, the champ design is great, and the game has good art, music, and sound. Game balance is constantly evolving but is currently in a good place, where almost all characters are viable.\n\nThe unique feature about the turn based combat is that it is fully deterministic. There is no random chance for crit or miss, or random effects on skills, so the outcome of a battle fully depends on your ability to outplay your opponent.\n\nThere are three main ways of doing that: You can keep information hidden from your opponent by utilizing fog of war, predicting the moves your opponents will do and reacting to them, and making moves that are not predicted by your opponent. For example, if you know that all your opponents expect you to dodge to safety, they might not even attack you. What better time to stand still and unleash your strongest skill?\n\nI've played over 100 hours of atlas reactor and the game is still very fresh. It's more fun playing in a group, so bring your friends or check out the free discord server and have fun!","May 14","true","45.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

(And yes, I've played League for 6 years, Dota, as well as Hots) Atlas Reactor found a way to eliminate the long drag of 'ally turn vs enemy turn' by evolving it into one phase where both sides' actions play out. That does mean, however, that you cannot undo actions like you could in normal JRPG's- but I feel this adds more to the strategic side of the game and becomes one of its strengths. I don't have many friends.. well I don't have many friends.. but I don't have friends who are into this type of game, but boy do they love to watch the gameplay. I was hesitant to pick up the game once it turned from F2P to P2P until I realized there really is no other game out there quite like this one. Will I enjoy it? Hell yeah. Is it a MOBA-killer?

It is confusing at first but each 'freelancer' has their own special unique abilities that really change up the game. There are three phrases in each round. Prep, which allows for freelancers to support and heal other allies, set traps etc. Dash which allows for freelances to latch onto enemies, or dash away from shots that will come in the blast phase. Blast which is where the majority of damage is lashed out with bombs and shots, and explosions and bites, etc.\n\nAtlas Reactor has kept me busy during this free weekend with quick 15 minute games that I feel could be longer. The matchmaking system has some improving to do as I get matched up with some of the best players in the game when I am brand new and noobish. The sensation of hitting an enemy where you didn't think they would be is a great one too. Guessing is a big part of the game and the late-game is where the suspense is at its fullest.\n\nI'd recommend it for $20.

In actual fact, AR is really fun and is really well paced!  I've played solo and up to a group of 4 friends,  and even when we lose its really fun.  Each character ("freelancer") is really well balanced and fun to play.  Combat plays out like an advanced chess game where to be most effectual you need to predict enemy movement, coordinate team attacks, and manage your own team health.\n\nThe best review I can give here is that I've lost hours playing AR.

(So yes, there is respawning.) Each character has a unique basic attack, 3 other moves typically with a multi-turn cooldown, 1 ultimate the fills up from using your moves, and then 3 non-character-specific one time use moves. Each turn you will use 1 ability and 1 move (or 2 moves). The other players will be making their moves simultaneously and everyone has 20 seconds each turnt o do so. Games are typically under 10 minutes.\n\nOK, so how well does this work? Pretty well. There are some UI improvements to be made, but all in all the pacing is excellent. Skillful play is rewarded. Like MOBAs, knowledge of the game and characters is extremely important. You can also somewhat customize the skills of your character which can help solidfy your strategy in a premade group. The characters are fairly unique and people will certainly get attached to particular 'freelancers'. There are only 18 characters right now so the roster needs to grow before launch. But the gameplay is more than solid. It's refreshing, it's unique, and it's well done.\n\nThe biggest concern is the size of the playerbase. Right now queue times are fine, but $30 will be a steep price to pay when this game launches. I think this is worth $30 since the characters are all included (like Overwatch). However, it looks too much like a F2P game from the outside. And it's a unique concept which can sometimes find trouble taking hold. I think this game would do much better with a $20 price tag (like Rocket League). But I digress. The game is currently free for the weekend and while queue times are fine now, it's not exactly overflowing with players.\n\nSo do I recommend this game? Yes. You should play it. It's a fun game that blends XCOM and MOBAs into a unique package with a couple twists. Is it worth $30? Well, that's always going to be subjective. But for me, the answer is yes as long as the population is there.\n\nEDIT: Changing my recommendation to a negative. Trion recently removed /all chat from games without any community discussion. There's no toggle or other options. It's just not there. This may not be a big deal to some but decreasing multiplayer interactivity is a huge pet peeve of mine. I suppose that's what I get for supporting Trion.","May 13","false","19.9"," 16 of 26 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","16","26","0","6"

This is an amazing game of decision-making, reads, and predictions. The UI is solid, the character and art design is familiar but has it's own uniqueness, and the microtransations aren't invasive (despite Trion's reputation).\n\n\n\n\nNow onto the long review.  I figured I'd TL;DR first since people hate reading a ton of stuff.  I an ex-Quake pro, Street Fighter FGC member, and have been competitive in any game I liked that I could (Legend in Hearthstone, diamond in Starcraft II, plat in LoL).  This game fits right in there with the legends of competitive gaming, easy to learn, tough to master.\n\nAnyone familiar with Xcom's mechanics will feel right at home here.  All turn's are simultaneous, moves are resolved as such, games are quick (15-20 mins), matchmaking is fair and as fast as you'd expect from any game (higher ELO you get, longer it takes).\n\nMicrotransations:  What makes or breaks any game.  At the 20 dollar pricepoint, this game gives you access to all current and future characters.  This decision was made as I undertstand, to make sure people always had access to the games main content.  In-game currency is used to unlock the majority of the other vanity content, and it's easy to acquire and it feels like you're always making progress in the system.\n\nThe game's lore is tied in well to the "Seasons" content and it feels like you have a good grasp of what's happening in the  world of Atlas, although this aspect of the game doesn't interest me much.\n\nThere are part's of the game I have gripes with; most of which are non-gamebreaking bugs\nthat the developers have been vocal about getting squashed.  Also, the community support from Trion and it's developers have been absolutely top-notch. (In what game can you just PM a developer and get an instant response?).\n\nAll and all, I highly recommend giving the game a try, whether it's through a refer a frend code or otherwise.  Just ask a streamer for a code I'm sure they have plenty to hand out.","May 14","true","33.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It is classed as an arena game like Dota mixed with XCOM, but from what I have played it feels more like a new unique game whilst still taking elements from games like the above mentioned.\n\nI am not going to get into it in high detail, but there are 16 different characters to play from, each varying from the other and each with different roles. It is supposed to be focused a lot around teamwork, and if people work and plan moves together than there will be much better results than not. I think that the best thing about this game is that it already has a lot of content as devs said "With 16 Freelancers, 3 maps, versus, co-op, and single player modes, and a Mod system to allow you to customize your Freelancers abilities, the game already offers a ton of depth and replayability." and since it is in beta there is a lot of room for growth and for the community to develop.\n\nAll in all, I think that this is a really fun strategical team based multiplayer arena-like game, although since I am not one for strategy games I will probably not be picking it up unless friends get into it. However if you do enjoy strategy games then I would recommend this, as it has a co-op mode, online PvP mode, and several single player modes, at least one game mode everyone is bound to enjoy.","May 16","true","0.7"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","2"

Fun and addicting gameplay\nAtlas Reactor is a turned based game unlike any of it's kind from before.\n\nI've probably logged well over 50+ hours from alpha/beta alone, sadly it doesn't show on Steam :(\n\nIt looks to use concepts from other successful games such as league of legends (Champion system with 3 normal abilities and an ultimate) with a tile system like Final Fantasy Tactics (tiles on the ground but with different gameplay elements.) Each of these tiles can have various powerups as well (Extra Damage, HP regen, or Increased travel distance) The game lasts a set amount of turns, OR until one team has killed the enemy 5 times. So let's break it down into the four types of abilities the game offers.\n\nTurn 1\nJust briefly here, it's not really a phase. It applies to everyone. This is solely a movement phase. You choose on the map where you want to move, all other abilities are greyed out for this turn.\n\nTurn 2 and beyond\nThis is where things get interesting. Every character is offered numerous abilities with various powerups/mods you can apply to them. There are FOUR different phases/types of abilities the game employs in a specific order:\n\nPrep Phase\nThe prep phases occurs before any other action takes place. For example, some characters place mines on the ground or launch a nuke into the sky that will show where it is going to land. These prep phases occur before anything else happens and usually will activate at the start of the next turn with a few exceptions, but anybody can see them take place.\n\nDash Phase\nI like to call it the dash phase. This is where you make dem crazy jukes. You're in somebodies line of sight, barely any hp left? Well you can use your dash ability (lets you move BEFORE the attack phase. Read below) and you can dodge the attack causing them to waste their turn, sometimes dash abilities can even cause damage to really let you gain the upperhand. You can also use this strategically to block predictable incoming enemy attacks for your allies.\n\nAttack Phase\nWhere ♥♥♥♥ goes down. Literally. Everyone uses your attack here, but it's always planned out before hand. So if you choose to use an attack on somebody, but they've qued in a dash already it's going to miss. That's how the game works. BUT... If you predict where their dash is going to go... You can REALLY screw them over. This is where the complexity of the game comes in, and seeing how dashs also have huge cooldowns, counting turns is also a great idea.\n\nMovement Phase\nFinally the movement phase, at the end of the turn you can move your character. Remember in prep phase that tactical nuke we sent out? Well if you place it correctly, you can screw them over by having them walk into it at the end of this turn.\n\nIn a nutshell the game goes Prep>Dash>Attack>Movement ALWAYS in that order.\n\nFeel like I've been rambling for awhile, so I'll sum up the game in a tl;dr with some pros and cons\n\nPros:\n-Multiplayer so you can play with friends\n-User friendly and easy learning curve, but for higher tiers of play expect to start counting cooldowns, planning attacks out carefully, and knowing what other characters do\n-Interesting selection of characters - Theres a champion for everyone whether it's a tanky champ, support, or dps.\n-Very good voice overs\n-Not pay to win. You get a free champaion rotation, and every champion is purchasable via a "Ingame currency" you get after every match similar to league.\n-Bot matches for people that don't like PvP\n-Good art - fun looking maps\n\nCons\n-Online - some games you will have an ally disconnect\n-Some characters might feel OP. I don't consider this really a con since once you learn, it's actually quite balanced.\n-Not very many maps, but already confirmed via their live stream more will be released\n-Smallish champion pool, but more are coming\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nThis game is hella fun. It's really addictive and I've enjoyed it a lot. I can't think of anything thats horribly wrong with the game besides the obvious facts of playing a game online. Give it a shot and you won't regret it at all!\n\nFinal Rating: 9.5/10","May 13","true","0.2"," 23 of 40 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","23","40","0","1"

This RPG style mechanic allows players to plan one (or more) actions to be executed during the turn and a move. The sequence of execution is particularly clear (Prep , Dash, Blast and Move). This simple mechanic allows for a lot of depth in the gameplay as it introduces the notion of outplay.\nPrediction is as important as your actions in this game, which is what makes it an interesting game (and the execution is spot on, allowing for serious outplay and bluffs).\n\nThe idea of a simultaneous turns makes the game pace particularly not slow as one would expect. The "decition" phase, where you plan your move, is pretty on point with the 20s timer and the resolution phase (spectating the outcome of the turn) is also very well executed that it is entertaining to watch.\nAnd here is where the details come to play, the freelancers (heroes/champions) all have quotes that mesh in really nice to add this interesting spectating feel.\n\nThe "taunt" mechanic is an example of the good little mechanics that are executed quite nicely. A taunt allows you to decide to play a short clip for everyone (friendlies and enemies) before you execute the ability for that turn (taunts are associated with abilities). Taunts act as a stylish bragging/confidence boost for instance taunting a prediction attack before it is executed adds much style to the basic mechanic. It is always nice to see someone taunt and miss their ability though. This adds a new dimension to the player.\n\nThere are other basic mechanics like cover/last seen but those are best found out after playing for a while and add some depth to the game.\n\n\nLastly, regarding the B2P model, I think the game is worth the money invested, very solid concept, splendid execution and most of the things can be crafted in game for no extra money.\n\nTL;DR Great concept, perfect execution, worth the price tag. Interesting little perks and mechanics that add depth. Kept me playing for the entire time I have been trying it out, which is not very often for most games I play (and I played most MOBAs and MMOs and a lot of RPG and RTS games).\n\nNo excuses for bad latency, and you start outplaying from the very first turn.","May 17","true","62.3"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

It's like XCom meets Heroes of the Storm.\n\nYou have the turn-based combat of Xcom with the Hero selection and abilities of HotS.\n\nSimultaneous action selection (preperation/dash/blast/movement) mean you have to anticipate the enemy team's actions, and it cuts down on waiting for the turn phase to complete drastically.  You only have to wait 20s in Co-Op and PvP mode before the next turn.  AI only mode means you get a whole 60s, if you're trying to learn a character or get a feel for the game.\n\nMy only concern is if the entrence fee is going to gate the game from a large playerbase.  It is, after all, a predominately PvP arena-like game, and you need a large base of players to keep queue times short.  I'm a bit curious why they didn't go for a F2P model, and offer a hero pack at $20 to start.  [shrugs]\n\nI'm going to enjoy this free weekend and decide to risk the investment over it, but I highly recommend everyone interested to get your feet wet for free while you can.\n\n[UPADATE:  I pulled the trigger and picked up the 20$ package.  I'm just... enjoying this game on  too much. It scratches an itch I didn't really even know I had.]\n\n9/10 - Innovative, unique in the market, and a general good time, especially if you can grab some friends to join you.

In just a blink of an eye you'll no longer after to worry about that naggy wife, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ boss, or dirty kids anymore... Because it'll be 50 years in the future. Seriously, time flies playing this game. Matches feel barely minutes long instead of the ~20 they normally are. Hours pass by and before you know it, it's 3am and you absolutely have to sleep before that amazing 6am shift.\n\nAtlas Reactor was a godsend to me. I love video games, especially games like LoL, but they're always just a smidge too fast for my reaction time. I excell at games where I can take just a second to think before I make a choice, and Reactor has mastered this in the best way possible. Simultaneous turns! Not only does it give you a window of time to calculate a move, think about what your opponent is doing, and try to predict their dash/move phase, it keeps the game moving at a still rapid pace. This takes a lot of the mechanical skill of moving your fingers lightning speed away, and increases the ability to play a good head game. Like a very fancy game of chess.\n\nThe characters are diverse, no two are exactly the same. Every role (support, frontline, firepower) are all very fun to play. Normally I shy away from support/tank roles, favoring DPS, but each character has a way to be a firecracker. The art is stylized in a very fun and interesting way, and the voice acting is on fleek.\n\nThe future is bright for this game.

I tried it for the weekend and was immediately hooked. It is unique. Intense, fast-paced matches that require strategic thinking instead of twitch reflexes.\n\nThink Xcom + lol or dota + pokemon.    So basically, you have champions you pick from, and all of them have QWER abilities specific to each + 3 generic spells that anyone can pick from (just like summoner spells in lol).\n\nWhat happens next, is a 4v4 strategic-intense elimination match. It is round based, so you pick your moves and proceed to the resolve phase, where everyone sees the result of their actions.  Its like deciding what you want to do in a board game and seeing everyone's decisions at the same time.\n\nWhy is this fun? First of all, it aint slow at all... turns are damn fast and there is alllloooot to take notice. So in a way, it has the strategy thinking of starcraft with the positioning and prediction of Dota styled mobas.\n\nTrion world is experienced in online games and usually come up with cool unique ideas. The achievement system, skin system and things that you can work on here, are just increadible. It aint just about the battle, but growing your account, getting titles, frames, banners, different taunts, unlockable-achievement-based skins (something other games could use..)\n\nFor its uniqueness amidst the ever growing, repetitive, generic mobas, this game is DEFINETLY worth it!\n\nPortuguese\n\nJogo muito bom e viciante. Unico, intenso, rapido e extremamente estratégico. Não precisa de reflexos ninjas ou 300 apm, pra ser mt bom aqui.\n\nVocê escolhe um heroi (igual a dota e lol) que possui QWER e mais 3 habilidades genéricas (alá summoner spells) e parte pra uma arena que parece um jogo de tabuleiro.\n\nVocê escolhe seus movimentos  e tem um tempo mttttt curto pra isso e ve o desenrolar da luta.\n\nVocê tem que prevê aonde seu inimigo vai estar, se ele vai se mover ou ficar parado, se você vai ser atacado ou não, olhar seus cooldowns e o movimento dos seus amigos. Apesar de não precisar de reflexos rapidos, você irá precisar de um pensamento muito estratégico e veloz.\n\nEsse jogo com toda certeza, será um e-sport. Vale 100% o preço dele, não é pay to win e opera igual a Lol, com skins.\n\nVocê ainda pode pegar títulos, fotos e skins com achievements.... Sim skins com achievements... algo que os demais mobas poderiam ter tb...\n\n9/10\n\n\n\n","June 5","true","21.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

Tutorials are very good, rules are simple and yet complex.  Fun factor was top notch, graphic smooth and well drawn, and they managed to integrate 4v4 turn based game into a seamless experience.\n\nConclusion:\n\nI may change my mind later, since I've only played 1.5hr so far, but from what I can see I have a pretty good feeling that I will like this game and continue to play for foreseeable future.\n\nIf you liked XCOM, then chances are you'll like this game.  It's still Early Access but doesn't feel like it at all and more importantly, it's a well made game.  I highly recommend this game.","May 20","true","17.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Not for everyone, but very well done and alot of fun.\n\nI've always been a fan of games like XCOM, Final Fantasy Tactics, Disgea, and such. Atlas Reactor takes that joy to the next level. Fun characters mixed with assassins or realstic characters create an entertaining atmosphere, with cartoon graphics on some characters and just guns and explosions on others.\n\nGame wise, the true trick of doing well is predicting what the enemy players will do. Not always easy with people, but very rewarding when you pull off 50+ damage in one turn. No single charecter currently feels OP, and every charcter feels unique, bringing their own play style to the board.\n\nLike any MOBA, try a few charecters before you give up on the game. Found I hate playing a couple charcters, but LOVE a couple others.\n\nGive it a try. Might just be the MOBA for you.","June 4","true","5.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I love Atlas Reactor and highly recommend it to anyone that likes tactics and strategy games!  Each turn in every ~20 minute game contains a variety of complex choices which result in an unending variety of results. You can take this decision matrix to the next level by grouping up with your friends and creating a team composition to pull of big combos and counter your opponents.\n\nI also enjoy the mods for your abilities which are simply unlocked by playing a Freelancer - the differences that they apply adds more depth to gameplay and longevity to characters.  The devs have made a smart decision by applying a buy to play model for this game since it allows them to focus on game balance and future content instead of a microtransactional economy,\n\nThere will be plenty of content to boost their bottom line via alternate animations for abilities, taunts and cosmetic skins.  In my opinion this game has unlimited potential and has uncovered a new space for competive gaming.  If you do try it out make sure to stop by the Atlas Reactor Discord server to chat with people and party up with voice comms.

Atlas Reactor is a turn-based strategy game with a top down perspective similar to XCOM. The game is 4v4 deathmatch oriented game, it could be considered a MOBA but it does lack your standard towers and minions though. The game has switch to a buy to play format instead of a free to play like most MOBAs but I feel that it does suit the game better, my only complaint would be that skins cost money. They did say skins could be unlocked through actual play though. One of the the best thing about the game is the community, There is a very active discord for the game run by Kiwi and Maltroth. Then there is the community manager Muzzy who spends alot of time listening to what we all have to say. The game features multiple different characters and roles like most MOBAs and is set in a scifi setting. The game is higly addictive and I really do enjoy it, I honeslty havent played a different game since I picked this up.

Other turn-based strategy PvP games are either card-based or are only 1v1 with each player controlling a whole team, such as Aerena or Banner Saga: Factions.\n\nEven though the game is currently in Early Access, the base game play is rock solid. The 20-second duration of the decision phase creates a sense of urgency and tension and keeps match durations reasonable. You can sit down for a single-match bite-size play session of around 20 minutes.\n\nThe developers have been taking player feedback into account as they continue to build upon the solid foundation and have been making measured balance adjustments. Two new Freelancers and a new arena map have been added since Beta began and there are many more of both in the pipeline.\n\nIf you dig turn-based strategy games as well as team-based PvP then Atlas Reactor is all win.

Pop™ Shill","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SmileyBMM/","128 products in account","Product received for free\n\nEarly Access Review\n\nTldr: With unacceptable business practices and already shadey price structure. This game seems to be another Trion cash grab. Except unlike the other ones, this isn't even good.\n\nThis review is not going to mention gameplay, whilst I have thoughts on it, I could not stomach enough hours to have a complete viewpoint.\n\nAtlas Reactor is another game made by the infamous Trion, if you are unaware of this company stop and read to reviews for Trove (another game they made). This company seems to not care about the consumers, and only sell to people who haven't heard of Trion’s terrible practices.\n\nHowever the main beef with this game lies in the technical and graphical aspects of the game. This game has absolutely terrible performance, which is odd, because Trove was an incredibly solid game tech wise. With an Evga FTW 750Ti I was unable to hit passable frame rates, being one of two games to have that be the case. Also loading screens were at times longer than Fallout 4 (Not a game to be compared to when loading times are involved). Even weirder, I frequently encountered various small and big gripes on the technical side of things, something Trove and Rift did not have. The first weird quirk I dealt with was the game opening two instances, a weird but forgivable issue. The next was the fact the game launched in laptop resolution windowed, non maximized and uncentered, more than ok if this issue didn't happen every time i launched the game. The third was crashes with no explanation, just a windows game encountered an error message. In fairness, Trove did have this last one, but only on OpenGL (and was even fixed).\n\nHowever the most egregious problem on the technical side is the options menu. Never before have I seen such an abysmal set of options. The first issue with it is the fact there’s only 2 audio sliders, sound and voice oddly absent even when they should be in the game. Also you have to drag from the slider point, no click to go to where you want. The graphics are just low, medium, high, full screen mode, and resolution. For a game with this level of complexity, this is unacceptable, more so when this company should know better (Trove had a pretty solid set of options). Even more of a problem, there are no tooltips, thus I am unable to tell what the options even do.\n\nHowever let us say the technical problems are fixed (which I doubt), this still leaves another problem as well; graphics and art style. This game follows the cell shaded style of games like Borderlands 2 and some cartoon elements like TF2, however the style ends up looking sloppy and unpolished. The art almost looks like someone picked it solely because it can excuse the poor graphics (which it can’t), and is what's considered the new trend in the market. Which brings me to my next point, this game just looks like it's trying to hop on every trend and see what sticks. Sci fi cartoon cell shaded colorful hero based skin-fest game with abilities, sounds like a mouthful but sums up this new trend, and this game ticks all the boxes, It feels like it's trying to fit with this trend, because that's what people want now.\n\nThis still leaves graphics, this game looks like it would fit right in graphics fidelity wise with Borderlands 2, a game that came out in 2012. The graphics are dated, with old looking menus and antique animation. However the real problem (and the one that made me stop playing) is the heavy handed use of blue. It’s everywhere, the menus, the grid, highlights for attacks, the allies info, it’s all blue. If this game allowed me to change colors (hint hint) I wouldn't care, just a quick menu change. However we are stuck with this, and it makes the game harder than it should. Players may not be able to tell what's part of the map, where the grid is, or where attacks go when it all starts heating up. It starts to get pretty crazy and with not enough tooltips or color changes, it makes it crazy when it doesn't need to. This isn't going to be a problem with people who have played the game enough (and isn't as much of a problem to people who play games like this). The thing is, this is a problem that shouldn't exist, someone, somewhere should have stopped and thought “Maybe it shouldn't ALL be blue”. This also makes the game more confusing to watch, especially if you lose track of the easy to blend in cursor.\n\nAll in all, gameplay aside, I just couldn't get into the game. With a heaping of problems one after the other my patience wore out, if you are a casual video game player, avoid. If you are willing to slog through the problems to maybe understand the potentially good game, be my guest. However I think I shouldn't have to do so, and as such, won't.\n\nEdit: Some have said Glyph (the launcher for this game) is spyware, I have no clue if this is true, but thought people should be aware that's a thing.","May 13","false","1.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

This is certainly true in the gaming sphere where a successful new genre IP will eventually be mimicked to ad nauseam. Some happen over night (FNAF clones) while others, in the case of the MOBA genre, have taken years to mimic the addictive Warcraft III custom map Defense of the Ancients (which also had clones to ad nauseam.) This time around, we have a MOBA wrapped in a couple layers of turn based sheets with Atlas Reactor. Is this attempt to deviate from the standard three lane, mob fest the shot in the arm the genre needed or simply a failed experiment? Regardless of what it is, I will commend it for trying something different.\n\nWhen I first saw this game, I was quite pleased with the aesthetic. The humor they tried to attach to it does not hold up, but the simple designs stand out thanks to the bright color schemes. Characters are diverse from your standard humans to robots and some bizarre aliens. Particle effects and lighting are not as up to par, but the character animations look fluid from movement to ultimate attacks. It does not have a lot of moving parts, but it is easy on the eyes.\n\nThis game took a giant risk utilizing turn based elements and it will be a deal breaker for a lot of players. You have four phases that all characters act out even if killed: prep for traps, dash for emergency movement, battle for attacks and then movement. Each character plays out there actions even if they are killed and can even be healed as long as the health recovered is more than the damage received. This is where the majority of the challenge settles; anticipating where a enemy will move, where they will attack and who they decide to gang up on. A simple dash phase can be the difference between a well executed team effort or a narrow escape to disrupt a perfect kill. The problem is with the waiting that is involved after selecting the round action. You need to watch every move until everyone has gone, which can make anyone impatient. If someone is killed, they must wait a full turn (the turn after they are killed) before they can respawn on the map in a random location. The first team to kill five or have the most kills at 20 rounds (or most in overtime) will be deemed the winner. If you play strategically though, you will find it can be a ripe challenge to get even three kills by the 20 round mark.\n\nMicro-transactions are forgivable for a free to play game that is fully released, but if I paid $20 to access the game and then discovered lot of it is in the store, I would be rather disappointed. This is not so much B2P as it is B2A (buy to access). The content on offer is rather slim too with just a handful of maps and around 20 characters, which thankfully have skills you can swap out (after unlocked) to change up the gameplay style a little. As it stands now though, there is not enough on offer to qualify the price tag.\n\nThis game is an online title, so the game is only worth it if you can play it. There have been several times I have played only to have my entire team drop out at once with half the enemy team doing the same. Online queues felt rather long, even with the free weekend. I decided to talk with some players outside of the game client to see if this was normal before it came to Early Access and was told that was the case. It just arrived on Early Access recently, but a game with this small a community can make finding matches a pain.\n\nThe options menu left much to be desired with only the broad option to set low, medium or high quality and decide if you want full screen or windowed. Volume options, profanity filter and chat options exist, but there really is nothing to incorporate Antialiasing or V-Sync. It could explain why the graphics appear slightly bland on appearance. Frame rate drops occurred from time to time as well, mostly during dash phases when multiple characters were sprinting at the same time. Loading screen freezes also happened to activate while loading into the game using the client, which required a forced shut down of the program. It could certainly be worse, I will give the developers that.\n\nIt is always a positive step for developers to try new things, but it doesn't mean the attempt will be received well. The game has an interesting and challenging approach to a genre over saturated to death with routine and meta builds that eliminate the fun required for a game to be great. That said, a game also needs to be worth the price of admission and at this point the game just isn't worth the $20 entry fee. You are also forced to use a third party service that was more trouble using than removing thanks to my anti-virus (not using Avast) labeling it as a threat. It has a great idea to work off of, but it is ultimately a non-recommendation due to technical issues and cost. I will eventually try this game again in the future, so hopefully then it will be ironed out and have a larger community.\n\nPros\n\n- Visually pleasant to look at\n- Challenging tactical gameplay\n- Tutorial, Solo and Co-op with bots (plenty of options to learn instead of throwing in blind to the wolves)\n- Varies skills and abilities to unlock to allow characters different play styles\n\nCons\n\n- Micro-Transactions (You paid at least $20 dollars)\n- Connectivity issues, frame rate drops, partial loading screen freezing\n- Extremely slow combat, a lot of downtime waiting for everything to play out\n- Very thin amount of content\n- Options and Settings offer little adjustment\n- Online community is small, queue times are long as a results","May 14","false","9.8"," 37 of 77 people (48%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","48","37","77","2","3"

It plays well with a solid gameplay idea, however the roster of characters is small as the game stands. The game's 4 phase turns with simultaneous turn taking provides for faster and more action packed gameplay that causes you to have to think on your feet and predict what your opponents will do next. The gameplay is solid and nothing seems imbalanced from my short playtime. The playerbase is small (Which isn't really an issue but games can take long to find). The payment model is wonky, the game isn't bad for the $20 price model but at the moment I don't see why they strayed from their original plan of F2P with paid for heroes. I think the playerbase would strongly benefit from this and I would more easily be able to form a team to play with. As it stands the game is far more enjoyable with a group as that is the only way to use actual strategy and tactics. I would give the gameplay a 9/10 based on originality and solid mechanics, but the game as a whole gets a 7/10 from me based on payment model alone.","May 13","true","5.6"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","2"

It's highly addicting and outplaying your opponents in win or lose scenarios never felt so satisfying. Current game mode is first to five kills or most kills by turn twenty. If you are tied, the game goes into sudden death where if one team gets a kill on a turn and the other side doesn't, they win. If you both get a kill it stays tied and the game continues. This has lead to some pretty intense matches and I'm glad I made my purchase.

Also for $60 price option you could just get XCOM 2 instead, which also has robust SP and MP offering. $100 price option is insulting. I'm also skeptical that this will go F2P with heavy microtransactions.\n-Ugly fake borderlands art style. Borderlands looks great. Borderlands inspired games often do not.","May 13","false","0.1"," 20 of 75 people (27%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","27","20","75","2","0"

It isn't worth the install when so many better games by better and more reputable companies are out.\n\nMoreover and the biggest worry should be that this game is published by Trion.  The company responsible for the worst launch in game history today, Archeage.  Also the company who allowed rampant hacking and did nothing about it.  Especially if one bought in game currency.  It was almost as if Trion promoted or sanctioned the rampant hack to force ingame purchases and to steal from their customers.  I really wish they had gotten investigated. They probably tarnished the name of the great TV show, Defiance, and helped lead to its end... I am sure this game will be another cash grab with many dissatisfied customers wondering what happen to their hard earned money.  Look Trion up on the Better Business Bureau sometime.\n\nAnyway, Trion more than any company I have ever seen, deserves boycott.  Let this one pass, buy Overwatch or anything else for that matter, and let Trion fall on their stupid faces.","May 14","false","5.4"," 16 of 68 people (24%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","24","16","68","0","2"
