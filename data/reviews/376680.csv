The visuals are very nice, the music is appropriately "Renaissance-esque", and the play is fairly fast paced, with a match able to be completed in anywhere from 20-30 minutes, or perhaps a little longer if the players need to think about a particular action.  As a game, it's fairly light due to this, what many groups would call a "beer and pretzels" game, something to warm the group up for a proper, all-night kind of board game.  Despite that, it remains very fun and entertaining, if a little light.\n\nThe downside to this digital version is the poor AI.  Once you've wet your feet on them, you're really going to want to move on to multiplayer with your own group.  Being only about 30 minutes per match, it's perfect for laughing, chatting, and passing the time until your entire group is on, and players are obviously going to be a much greater challenge.  The AI doesn't truly understand how to counter-play an opponent by taking gems he will need in the future, or how to hold on to valuable gems, and generally just goes for the highest point cards they can, when they can, or take "freebie" cards if they're available.  Their poor play will leave you itching for a real contest.\n\nThe other downside is NO online play, it is against AI or local hotseat only, which I don't feel the need to go into further detail here.  TRAGICALLY missed opportunity there.\n\nThat aside, everything else about the game is pretty much flawless: if you've played the real card game, the digital version basically just removes all the tedious counting out your gems, depositing them back in the bank, reaching over the table to grab from the gem pile, etc, i.e. the administration stuff, and leaves you with the actual fun part of the game, playing it! And at $5 bucks, it's a steal.  No online play means you really don't need to buy copies of it for your friends, since they have to come over to play anyway.\n\nOverall, a great digital adaptation and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for something small and light (not to mention light on the bank account!) to fill in time until you can start some heavier gaming for an evening!\n\nTL;DR version:\n\nVisuals: 8/10 - Slick, polished, glittery, and makes you really feel like a Renaissance gem merchant!  Wish the card backgrounds had a little more tie-in with their gem bonus, but hey, the actual game has that too.\n\nSound: 7.5/10 - Fairly generic "card swish" sound when you play cards, or "plinking" sound when you turn in gems.  The Renaissance-era music in the background is heavy on the harps and lutes, and it's nice for a while but eventually I turned it off, as it does get to be pretty repetitive after some time.\n\nMechanics: 9/10 - Works flawlessly without any bugs or glitches, which is of course a bare minimum, and is exactly representative of the real card game.  I wish you could turn off the animations though, after a while, the slow-ish speed of the cards moving around gets to be a bit grating, but hey, it could be worse: you could be dealing with your sweaty friend sitting at the table next to you reaching over you to grab cards!  That said, the hotseat only nature of it means you may have to deal with your sweaty friend anyway :/\n\nAI: 5/10 - Very poor AI, with them making some plays that left me scratching my head.  They don't really watch for their opponents' plays, and instead play pretty much solitaire-ish.  This leaves them very open to exploitation by a decent, or even newer player.  They will go for nobles, when they have the chance, but don't have much of a game plan past that.\n\n\nOverall:\nSingleplayer: 7.5/10\nMultiplayer: 7/10 - The game plays out like the real card game, minus all the real card game fuss and mess.  Excellent work here!  My only regret is that it is local play ONLY, no online capabilities, which was a real missed opportunity, seriously, what kinds of game DON'T have online play these days?","September 18, 2015","true","2.8"," 27 of 27 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","27","27","0","3"

I'm really glad that I picked up the computer version.  The game seems to be one of those elegant games that are easy to learn, but tough to master.\n\nThe idea is that you collect gems that you can use to purchase cards.  Cards give you bonuses towards purchasing other cards, but also can give you victory points.  To be fair to the person who goes last, the game ends at the end of the round whenever a person accumulates 15 victory points.\n\nYou also can earn 3 victory points by gaining a noble -- whenever your total bonus matches the numbers on a displayed noble, you earn that noble (assuming no one else has beaten you to him).  Earning a noble also gives you a gold gem, which is like a wild card.\n\nThe game is certainly casual and light, as strategy games go.  But it's fun.  If you want a strategy game that you can spend 15 minutes or so playing, to kill some time now and again, but will still satisfy your brain, then I highly recommend it.","January 27","true","52.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CelJaded/recommended/376680/","CelJaded","CelJaded","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CelJaded/","84 products in account","A visually faithful, if sometimes flawed rendition of Splendor that still delivers a heady fix of strategic card-collecting from the comfort of your PC.\nThis fairly recent mobile port by developer Days of Wonder is a direct translation of the competitive multiplayer strategy card game from designer Marc André and publisher Space Cowboys.\n\nPlayers assume the role of Renaissance era merchants as they seek to secure cards that represent the various mines, cargo ships and bazaars responsible for the acquisition and distribution of their valuable gem stones.\n\nThe first thing that strikes you about Splendor - other than its rather fantastic artwork - is just how simple it is for a novice to jump into the game. It's fast to learn and the equally swift pace of play gives it an addictive 'one more go' sensation that's hard to resist.\n\nDespite its inherent simplicity, there are some interesting layers of strategy bubbling beneath the surface and although it might take you 5 minutes to pick up the basics, it will likely take another 5 hours before you'll really begin appreciating the most efficient paths towards victory.\n\nLike most "Euro" style board games, Splendor features very rigidly defined mechanics at the expense of theme, but what helps it succeed is the variety of strategies that you employ from session to session.\n\nSpecializing in a specific type of gem, or "buying all the greens" for example, could be a legitimate approach should the initial setup feature several high-scoring cards with a suitably steep emerald cost.\n\nAlternatively you might decide to downplay the importance of the expensive tier 3 cards entirely and balance out your purchases as equally as possible in order to attract the lucrative noble cards into your tableau.\n\nIt's even possible to play an opportunist role; collecting as many gem and gold tokens as the limit allows whilst waiting for the other players to reveal the cheaper bonus cards that will allow you to maximize your profit margin.\n\nYou won't ever get into the feeling of being an actual gem dealer, as Splendor is more a game of numbers than anything else, but the wonderful artwork from artist Pascal Quidault certainly does a good job of making each card evocative of its period setting.\n\nReputedly inspired by Anglo-saxon artists, Quidault effortlessly breathes life into what could easily have been a very sterile game with his various illustrations of appraisers, expeditions and Renaissance settlements giving the production a certain level of authenticity and class.\n\nMuch of what I've said above translates into the Steam version very well. The high definition UI and card graphics successfully remain true to the original game and there's some added value in the form of crafty AI opponents, achievements and a handful of single player challenge packs.\n\nSimilar to chess puzzles, the themed challenges in this digital version are an interesting addition that task a player with striving towards a particular goal such as earning a set amount of points in a limited number of turns or collecting a combination of cards without the assistance of added gem tokens.\n\nWhilst the difficult challenges in this sense do provide a satisfyingly "thinky" experience, it has to be said that there's really not enough of them.\n\nThe easy challenges by comparison - which sadly represent the bulk of the pack - are too often dull and repetitive affairs that sometimes don't even present you with a failure condition; usually meaning that you simply need to collect points aimlessly until reaching a preset amount.\n\nSome of the nuance in Splendor's flow of play is also lost when playing against AI opponents. I haven't played the original board game itself, but I can easily see the potential that exists for blocking competing players.\n\nThis is not a game of direct interaction, but the competition over resources is sorely missed in the digital version as AI players mostly seem to ignore your efforts in favour of building their own point-accumulating engine.\n\nThere's no online mutliplayer included in the digital rendition either, although there is a hotseat multiplayer mode for up to four players as well as leaderboards for those players who are willing to register an account at the publisher's website.\n\nPerhaps the most jarring facets of the Steam version though are the rough edges brought about by its port over from mobile devices.\n\nSome of these gripes are minor, like the multiplayer section which is still named "pass and play" (instead of the more traditional "hotseat") and the menu dialog which asks you if you wish to "exit the app" instead of "exit the game".\n\nOther problems are more severe however, like the fuzzy or sometimes missing text on the challenge menus, the overly repetitive music and the lack of difficulty settings for the AI players.\n\nThe Steam store page is also inundated with customers reporting crash-to-desktop errors and I can attest to experiencing a dreaded CTD once myself when trying to start a new game from the main menu.\n\nThese problems certainly make this Steam version a disappointment at times, but I don't feel that they're serious enough to deter from the strength of the original game's design as it's that strong on the basis of its own merits.\n\nRead the full review at my blog »[www.celjaded.com]","December 2, 2015","true","8.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's a pretty good one at that.\n\nGameplay, to be simple in explaining, is picking the cards and then playing the best you can. All luck is based upon card draw, which is just like having dice (no matter how much European gamers insist otherwise). There's some strategy involved in play, and sometime you have to change it up in challenges. Otherwise it can be kind of the same thing over and over.\n\nThere's no online mode to square off against real, live players with different strategies. So you only get AI opponents, and they pick one of three ways to play. That's a minus overall, though to be honest the people who do play these type of games competitvely online tend to be fast, non-talkative and cut throat, which is kind of strange for a game over cards. But the randomness and good AI make up for that limitation.\n\nI got this on a sale price on Steam, but I like this sort of thing and probably would pay full price for it. It's certainly cheaper than really buying the cards and having to convince someone to play. It's easiness and short game play are a plus, and the computer takes care of the card set up and scoring points for you.\n\nAll in all, I'd recommend it if it sounds interesting to you and is on any sale, and wholeheatedly even at full price if you're a fan of European-style board games.","January 7","true","22.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
