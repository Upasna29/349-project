It is a minimal, abstract platform game. Aside from that, it is a really cool platform rhythm game. The levels start out "simple" the music isn't too complicated. As you get to checkpoints, more complex rhythms are put into the soundtrack and these make other things happen: blocks appear and disappear, shapes grow and shrink, static fields jump, bouncy floors activate, gravity shifts. Paying attention to the music and how it affects the level is crucial to finishing. At the end of each level there is a boss fight. Each level the boss fights get more complex.\n\nOnce you have finished the game three mirror levels open up. One wrong move and you fail - you must complete the entire level without dying. And all the patterns are backwards. Yeah right.\n\nFun but short platform game.","April 5, 2014","true","2.8"," 64 of 66 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","64","66","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stumpo/recommended/242820/","stumpo","Stumpokapow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stumpo/","2598 products in account","140 is a very short (~45 minutes or so, maybe less) platformer with ultra-minimal geometric graphics, a little reminiscent of Thomas Was Alone with even more of a commitment to visual minimalism and trashy, angry-psychadelic graphics. What sets it apart is that the platforming is built around rhythm elements, much like something like Beatbuddy or Sony/PSN's "Sound Shapes". Basically, as you go through the levels there are timed obstacles, platforms, and other mechanics that play along with the dirty, dub-step / glitch electronica that comprises the music. Periodically you will collect an orb which you bring to a set point, which causes the colour palette, sound, and mechanics to shift. At the end of each of the three levels is a boss which functions kind of like a shoot-em-up-ish genre. If you die, the screen dissolves into analog TV fuzz as the music glitches out even further and you respawn at the nearest checkpoint.\n\nCheat code: If you want to make the game easier, go slowly and count out a beat. Mostly the rhythm patterns seem to be 4/4 or 8/8 so if you can count the beat in your head you'll be able to crack the code no problem.\n\nWhether you feel like you'll get $5 out of such a short game is up to you, but I found it to be a great experience. Often times when I died, I chuckled in spite of myself because I found the rhythm mechanics very clever. I especially liked the bosses.\n\nBecause of the emphasis on music, I recommend headphones--certainly you would find it very difficult to play without audio.\n\nHopefully this review has given you the information you need to try to decide whether or not this is for you.","July 6, 2014","true","0.8"," 40 of 43 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","40","43","0","0"

Everything in the world moves to the beat of the music, effectively you could probably complete parts of this game with your eyes closed; judging it by the beat of the music. I did really enjoy the plat-forming of this game though, I just wish that it was longer with some more mechanics added in.\n\n\nAudio - 8/10:\nThis is where the game really shines, like I said before, everything in the world is tied in with the music, it all flows really well and the music itself sounds really bloody cool as well. It's techno-style music... Kind of hard to describe but below you'll find a Gameplay and Commentary on my channel so you can hear it there anyways (Coming soon...).\n\n\nOverall - 8.0/10:\nEven though this game was very short I really enjoyed it, the sound absolutely makes this game what it is and the visuals just look really crisp. The developer(s) obviously knew what kind of game they wanted to create and they made it. I'd say it's more of an art piece than a game!

Nothing was impossible and it was all enjoyable due to the soundtrack and visuals. In my personal recommendation, if you have $5 to spare on this game, you should probably buy it, if you don't have the 5 dollars, it's been on the humble bundle a few times and its not super popular, so you could probably pick it up from someone for very cheap, if not free from a friend. The best way to explain this game is fresh and relaxing. Which doesn't come very often in puzzle/platform games.\n\nOnly true regret: the game is very very short. would've been angry if it was $5, but I spent $1 on a bundle.\n\nSo now the standard game rating:Story: 8/10 (Nothing is over complicated, but at the same rate you could argue no story.)\nGameplay: 10/10 (Beats affect the game, and has a few creative elements to it. Plenty of challenge and timing, and perfection.)\nPresentation: 10/10 (Simplistic style, but all in all, very fitting, very fresh.)\nSoundtrack: 10/10 (these beats don't get old.)\nReplayability: 9/10 (Has a frustratingly hard set of mirror levels, which reward you with very rare achieves. separates the good from the mediocre.)","September 28, 2014","true","1.6"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","27","31","0","1"

In the platforming you have to go from point A to point B to dodging and using objects in the map. The game has in total 3 levels with each of them having 1 endboss. The endbosses are pretty challenging and really let you know you have to focus on what is happening on screen but also to the music that you hear.  What I like about the game is that it explains itself with no text, using only music and the world itself. This really helps the minimalist style. As you progress through the game, you can really hear and see that the levels are getting harder and have to think about what you are doing. The game is well designed, so when you die you know it is your fault. The music is also fun to listen to.  I first played the game on okay-speakers and later on a good-headset. The difference in enjoyment was huge. So I would recommend good audio equipment while you play the game.  Steam says the game took me in total 104 minutes.( I have to say that I left level 2 partway through once, so I had to start from the beginning of level 2. So the games doesn't save your checkpoints in a level. ) After you complete the main game you also unlock all the levels in mirror mode where you don't have any checkpoints. This can be fun for people who are searching for a challenge but I am not interested in playing it. All in all, the game was fun but felt too short for me. I had hoped the game had more harder levels.\n\nIn short: A nice, but short, minimalist style platformer where music is the key.\n","November 1, 2014","true","1.7"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","18","19","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TrevorJr/recommended/242820/","TrevorJr","Trevor Jr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TrevorJr/","356 products in account","This is a challenging platformer with some of the best music I've heard in a game since things like 'Sword and Sworcery EP' and 'Fez'. The music itself as well as some of the visuals are quite reminiscent of 'Fez' although they are very different games.\n\nWhen you first open the game, you are treated to the music straight away. There is no menu or text, other than the large '140' in the middle of the screen. Upon pressing any button you are thrust into the game itself, still with no instructions. This isn't a game for those new to the platforming genre, but those who have played the simplest flash game will easily be able to understand what to do.\n\nEach level of the game has it's own music to match the obstacles present there. You will need the music on, as all the obstacles are synced up to the beat and mastering the rhythms can mean the difference between life and death. At the end of each level there is a boss, it will challenge the skills you have learnt through the level leading up to it. These bosses aren't the typical 'fights' you may be used to from other games, but I find them to be fairer and more challenging than most.\n\nI absolutely adore the visual style of the game and the way it matches the music so well. The simplest touches can effect the game massively and when you first play it can be overwhelming, especially when you die. The patterns in the background that seemingly dance to the music fit the rest of the levels perfectly and aren't distracting or annoying, even when you are stuck on a particularly difficult section.\n\nOverall this is one of the best platformers I have ever played, the controls are extremely responsive and I never felt like I died because it was the game's fault. For the price there is the perfect amount of content in my opinion. With just enough challenge and variety to give you a few hours of gameplay, and even more if you want all the achievements.\n\nI would give '140' 5 stars, 10/10, 8/8 or whatever rating system you prefer, I love it. I will certainly be buying the soundtrack and I hope a sequel will be made one day.

Usually, the normal part can be blasted through in no more than 2 hours, and then you'll be presented with the ending sequence. If you're not paying attention to the game's "menu" afterward - or if you're not interested in the mirror stages challenge at all - you're seriously missing out. The 1-life nature of the challenge will force you to sync your mind with the rhythms, and that's when the true nature of this game really shines.\n\nIn-Depth Comment\nThere exists typically two types of platformers: one that tests your intelligence and one that tests your reflexes. 140 belongs to the latter type which I loathe and usually refrain from buying at all, but the inclusion of strongly rhythmic elements has made this game far more approachable than other sadistic titles in the genre. Most of the obstacles in particular act in tight concert with background music loops and aren't influenced by user behaviors, eliminating a lot of luck factor commonly observed in other reflex-based platformers. For the 3 mirror stages I was able to master each one within a 1 ~ 1.5 hour timeframe, making steady and perceivable progress in memorizing the level each time, thanks to the aid of the strong beats.\n\nAt the end of each stage there's also a "boss fight", featuring obstacles that react to user behaviors. This introduces certain degree of randomness into the play - while all the bosses still act with patterns, the boss fights can become a major source of frustrations in the mirror stages due to their reflex-centric nature. The only mirror stage boss I was able to get in one go was the final (3rd) one - the only boss that isn't actually influenced by user behaviors and thus the easiest to beat providing that you've done your homework (though the fight still remains highly intense). I found it immensely helpful to spell out the next pattern loudly and assertively as if I'm countermoving the final boss with my incantation, and experienced tremendous relief and satisfaction as my final word sealed the fate of the boss with all the well-timed rhythms and musics. Priceless moment.\n\nAll in all, this game is very challenging but was nicely designed in a way to prevent it from becoming a torture. It certainly ain't gonna end up in my list of top games, but it's a quality one nonetheless.","December 13, 2015","true","6.4"," 23 of 30 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","23","30","0","1"

It's simple elegance pervades every corner of the experience, to the extent it almost manages to push gameplay entirely out of the picture. The basic shapes and purposeful use of contrasting colors invokes comparisons to Mondrian, with a calculated simplicity and conspicuousness that elevates the presentation from rudimentary to a captivating example of minimalism. Moved by the beat of a reserved yet distinctive audio track, the experience feels alive as you move through levels, perfectly in sync with each other as if performing an elaborate dance.\n\nIn this way, you are something of an outlier; awkwardly progressing through areas you ought not to be in. This creates an odd sort of disconnect between the gameplay and the atmosphere, as while both work wonderfully together to create a brilliant rhythm based platformer, their is just something off about all of it that left me somewhat unsatisfied over the whole affair. I enjoyed every second of the one hour experience, but I also feel no need to spend anymore time within the game.\n\n140 is undeniably a very cool game, one which demands a closer dissection of its elements than you would assume at first glance, the core of which is incredibly tight and polished. It made me think and left me feeling smarter for overcoming its challenges, but as the small side project of a single developer it is, it shouldn't be expected to have the amount of content or range of mechanics to feel like a fully fleshed out concept. It's an experiment, one that succeeds at what it attempts while prompting you to dig deeper into its refined define, but that is all it is and expectations should be set accordingly before entering its psychedelic world.","July 7, 2014","true","0.9"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","17","22","0","4"

It mixes a rhythm game with a platformer, where as it goes on you'll need to use the abstract but enjoyable electronic music in order to time your movements.\n\nVisually it's extremely simple, but surprisingly appealing and even beautiful at times. Screenshots absolutely do not do it justice. I feel the slick animations in time with the music and sound effects, particularly in the boss encounters, raise the visuals above what you'd expect from such simple assets. Even the way the character morphs between shapes while jump and move is brilliant, even better than the squash and stretch animations of Thomas Was Alone.\n\nMechanically I felt the game did an excellent job at throwing new ideas at the player constantly, while giving concise organic lessons before throwing them into something more difficult. Each of the 3 bosses I fought had that small learning period as well. The checkpoints are frequent and I was rarely frustrated. It seems some players aren't even aware of the "second half", as they only appear if you go through the main menu back into the game, and go just further to the right than you had to go the first time. These 3 extra levels seem to be identical to the original 3, but mirrored left to right, using different color combinations, with permadeath... I didn't realize it the first time I tried the first mirrored level, until I died and spawned back at the intro. I decided to give it another crack and I was able to complete it without dying on the next try. The level of stress shoots through the roof, as the whole level becomes as tense as the hardest sections of the game. I don't really enjoy that level of difficulty, specifically the concept of punishing failure with repetition, but in this case it's not really extra content, so it can be safely skipped if you're not up to it.\n\nMy playtime so far, beating 4 of the 6 levels was just shy of an hour, but I quickly fell in love with it's simplicity. It doesn't match the charm of Thomas Was Alone, or the unbelievable visuals of FEZ, but it's damn good for what it is. It runs flawlessly at 120FPS at 1080P, but it probably supports higher resolutions as well. I played with a keyboard rather than a controller because I honestly just started it to see it, but it hooked me and I ended up beating the whole thing in one go. Pricing is up to the buyer, but I'd say it's certainly worth the asking price on a moderate sale, or in one of the dozen bundles it's been in.","June 19, 2015","true","0.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

You play as a square, and your goal is to get to the end of each level (3 in total). The only controls are left/right and jump, so it's not exactly complicated, nor are any of the jumps particularly difficult. What makes it interesting (and marginally challenging) is the timing of the jumps - you are typically tasked with jumping on or through obstacles that appear, disappear, or move in time with the music. Once you figure out the pattern of a particular area, it's pretty easy. The soundtrack is your typical indie-electronica type music, but suits the game well. Visually, although it is very simple, the look is pretty cool and even hypnotic at times (it looks like an Atari 2600 game on acid). The game only takes about 1 hour or so to complete, so keep that in mind when contemplating a purchase. If you like indie platformers or rhythm-based platformers and don't mind the price-to-length ratio, give it a go. Otherwise, if you're on the fence, I'd say wait for a 50% off (or more) sale.","August 22, 2014","true","1.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FallenAngelEyes/recommended/242820/","FallenAngelEyes","FAE","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FallenAngelEyes/","847 products in account","This game took me completely by surprise. I recently picked it up in the Humble Eye Candy Weekly Bundle, in which it was included for its aesthetic. I hadn't read anything about it yet, so I decided to just fire it up and go in cold. What I ended up playing was one of the best games I've ever played that uses music to engage the player with the gameplay mechanics.\n\nThe game's pretty good about ramping up the difficulty moderately, introducing new stage mechanics at a decent pace. The only time I really felt it was at all unfair about it was the boss fight at the end of Level 2, which seems to just involve guesswork if you don't know the pattern already. The rest of the time, my deaths were due to my own mistakes, either getting off rhythm or trying to rush too soon. Getting a feel for the rhythm of the music is crucial to successfully navigating a level and completing the boss fights.\n\nThe visuals are minimalist, but colorful, with the backgrounds pulsing in time to the music as the stage elements change. The bright palette is in stark contrast to Limbo, which was directed by the developer of 140, and it fits well with the electronic soundtrack (which I'll likely be purchasing).\n\nThe game was fairly short, as I finished the main levels within a little over an hour. There are additional levels which are mirrored versions of the main ones, but they're without checkpoints. I'm not sure I'll ever be able to finish those, but they're an option for those looking for an even greater challenge.\n\nI'd advise using a gamepad if you're more comfortable playing platformers with one, even though the controls are very simple (just directionals and jumping). As you can imagine, it's unfortunately not a game I'd recommend for anyone who has difficulty with hand/eye coordination.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed this game, especially at the price I bought it at, but even at its (low) full price, I'd still recommend it at its short length, just for the simplistic brilliance of the way it melded gameplay and music. Even though I probably won't be able to finish the challenge levels, I'll probably go back to play through the old ones just to re-experience them.\n\nIf it's playable for you and you're a fan of platformers or music games, definitely check it out.","July 14, 2014","true","1.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

The game requires you to jump and roll your way through a series of timing-based challenges, all of which are set to the throbbing, toe-tap-worthy beat of the game's Electronic Super Joy-esque soundtrack.\n\nYour goal throughout each level is to collect dual-colored orbs and then return them to various checkpoints. Each returned orb causes the level to fluctuate, activating moving panels and changing the game's color scheme. To collect each orb, you'll be faced with moving blocks, grey-matter platforms that kill you on contact, and tricky tests of your ability to time impressively challenging jumps. However, the levels provide plenty of checkpoints, saving your progress before each threat you face.\n\nThe end of each level features, like most games, a boss. The boss levels of 140 are the only times when your otherwise peaceful shape is armed with a weapon: a beam that shoots out of your shape automatically in time to the music's beat. Boss levels are long, creatively designed levels that require you to avoid projectiles while also correctly timing your attacks, making them often frustrating (but, in the end, rewarding) moments of the game.\n\nThe only noticeable downside to 140 is its astonishing lack of true save points. While there are several checkpoints within each level that you can return to when you die, exiting out of the game entirely will cause your progress in each level to be lost. Therefore, each level must be beat in one sitting, otherwise you'll simply have to start completely over next time you come back to the game.\n\nDespite this, the game is both fun and challenging and, if you manage to make it through all three levels, the end will unlock three extra bonus levels that allow you to play the first three levels backwards without checkpoints. This added challenge adds a few extra hours of gameplay—I have to assume, since I've never been skilled enough to play the bonus levels!","December 3, 2014","true","2.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

None of the challenges were at all satisfying to complete.\n\nSuper Meat Boy-style finesse is rarely required--just basic timing and a LOT of waiting. Many of the levels are designed to make gracefully darting through them impossible: for every second you actually spend moving or jumping, you'll spend a second waiting for a platform to materialize or move or deactivate, because it wasn't set correctly when you reached it. With such bite-size levels and challenges, these constant five-second mandatory pauses become grating, and clash with the music, which has a tempo and rhythm that encourage a sense of constant motion.\n\nAs for the art style? Eh, it's inoffensive, not great. It's going for a sort of pseudo-De Stijl look: each level contains lots of blocks of two arbitrary colors, with slightly different values for different level assets. The music might be tense with warm colors, or softer with cool colors, but that's the extent of the game's tonal consistency: the level mood jumps around from somber to exciting to chill with no real rhyme or reason. What is this trying to make me feel?\n\nWell, I certainly felt bored.","July 16, 2014","false","1.1"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

I played through a few levels, and found the rhythm parts up to the first boss a bit tedious.  It mostly involved waiting for a downbeat, and wasn't as exciting as a rhythm game should be.  I thought it was warming me up for better rhythm antics, but I was wrong.  Instead, it was warming me up for a terrible "boss", where you're micromanaging a "gun" that only shoots on every fourth beat, while trying to survive bullet hell.  Ten minutes of levels that are so easy that they border on tedious, and then it just throws you into "f***-you" hardmode.

The platforming gameplay is as shallow as one can imagine, your only actions consisting of jumping and moving (always at a fixed speed). Since the whole game revolves around stage hazards following musical rhythms, you always progress at the pace of the levels, waiting for the right time to advance. Boss fights are a little more interesting for deviating from the main game in different ways, though you are still a slave to the game's music-based mechanics in those.\n\nOh, and you can beat the main game in 1 hour. It's like, three stages long, and after the end you can replay mirrored versions of those same stages without checkpoints (you can't get much lazier than that with hard modes). That's about the entire game for you.\n\nThere's nothing broken about 140. It's just that it's boring, unfullfiling and has as much content as miss south carolina's skull. For the price it charges, you can get way more interesting games around gabe's funhouse.","January 10, 2015","false","7.1"," 22 of 39 people (56%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","56","22","39","4","2"

It's brief, and it's easy, but it is wonderful.\n\n140 is a simple platformer that is almost entirely about executing basic rhythm puzzles.  The levels are alive around you, and as the elements of level design move they create sound, stereo positioned relative to you, that participates in the music.  That music in turn guides you through the game's obstacles which comprise it.\n\nAt the same time, it is an aesthetic delight that plays with color and shape just as much as with sound and rhythm.  There is some replay value in the traditional sense in the form of mirrored versions of the three levels that remove checkpoints, but I would play through the game again anyway just because I like it.\n\nThe entire structural idea of moving past half-spherical ports embedded within the ground, finding an orb, returning to a receptacle, watching the world become washed over by the colors contained in the orb, and seeing that new environmental mechanics have come to life and are contributing to the music is absolutely enchanting to me. It just captures my imagination so vividly.\n\nThe fact that the orbs emit micro versions of the music that they will add before they have been integrated—and exhibit behavior similar to the level element that will come to life with that sound—makes it even better by providing thematic and logical consistency.\n\nJust one of many things that I love about this gem of a game.\n\nInexpensive and well worth experiencing.  I hope you'll pick it up.","November 10, 2013","true","4.1"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

Players however, will fondly remember this game as both a visual and musical marvel. Despite being relatively short, the game remains challenging and enjoyable with oodles of replay value to boot. I can confess to having completed three playthroughs myself - one of them probably under the influence of something.\n\nPlayers will be in awe of the minimalistic and colourful visuals, as this is a game that is indeed rife with aesthetic beauty. One stage of a level will be coated in an abundance of pastel colours, while the next will feel as warm as a summer's day in Dubai.\n\nThe music is dynamic to the extent that it feels like a living, breathing, entity. Fortunately, for fans of electronic music like myself, the progressive house soundtrack will melt your ears and have you floating away like you were having the best heroin trip of your life.\n\nThe gameplay is wholly unique in that it utilizes the ancient greek theory of Synesthesia in it's gameplay design. Platforms will move and enemies will shoot in time with the music like a well rehearsed play. In fact - this feature is the key to completing the game, as paying close attention to the music for cues, will signal when to traverse a platform or blast a ball of oppressive static into nothingness.\n\nThere are slight issues with the lack of a pause feature, framerate issues on lower end systems, and not being able to change the settings in the game client itself and only from the launch window. Fortunately, none of these are even anywhere close to ruining the game's integral experience.\n\n140 is a relatively cheaply priced game, suited for stoners, contemplative thinkers, and sensory junkies looking for a quick and potent fix.","July 20, 2014","true","3.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Once you finish the game, you can replay it in difficult mode. But I would like to add that at this level, you won't be able to use checkpoint location or even save.

I was pleasantly surprised to find that there wasn't much variety to the soundtrack so it quickly fell off and became boring. Though, it did slightly change...you can still feel it being recycled.\n\nThe graphical choice was probably more so due to lazyness, lack of imagination, time restraints, or even budget. Either way, this kind of style has been done before. Despite the fact that graphics obviously don't make the game...the devs could at least tried to do something new with it. (I do like the equalizer, though. That was somewhat nifty.)\n\nGameplay is straight forward. However, it becomes almost tedious. Your timing has to be absolutely perfect otherwise, you're going to have to hear the annoying static sound along with a checkpoint set back. At least there's checkpoints...\n\nThough, I do not mind pinpoint precision. Games like Super Meat Boy and Electronic Super Boy require such. But...they have more of a satisfaction to it once completing levels and a better soundtrack.\n\nI do understand that soundtrack and graphical choice are matter of opinion. Nevertheless, I believe that only goes to an extent.\n\nIf you're interested in this game; I suggest waiting for a pricedrop. It is definitely not worth $5 with the amount of OTHER indie games you can get for that price. Or, you know...get Super Meat Boy or Electronic Super Joy.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/meridin/recommended/242820/","meridin","Typhoon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/meridin/","516 products in account","140 is about as minimalistic as a platformer can get. It makes other minimalistic games look complicated.\n\nThe entire game is made out of the three most basic shapes: circles, triangles, and rectangles. These shapes are all colored very simply and don't even have any texture (except for the grey static that kills you). There's a reason no artists were needed to develop this game; calling the graphics in here "art" would be a bit of a stretch.\n\nHowever, what saves this game from being as boring as its graphics is the exceptional soundtrack. After all, it's a rhythmic platformer, so the music better be good, since it's essential to the gameplay. Fortunately, the music is great, and it fits the gameplay perfectly.\n\nIronically, for a game that has such an amazing soundtrack, you won't find an official OST anywhere. This is because the music is truly part of the gameplay, and so it's not as simple as just playing one long sound file in the background like most games do; the music is affected by what is happening in the game. The result is that the music you hear will vary slightly each time you play the game.\n\nUnfortunately, that means we are left with no soundtracks to listen to, apart from the title screen and level select music, which are probably the only real tracks you can listen to without actively playing the game. To listen to any of the music that plays during the actual game, you'll have to settle for watching videos on YouTube. An unofficial OST put together by fans can be watched here. While these videos are very well done, it's such disappointment to have no "real" tracks for each of the three levels.\n\nAnd yes, you heard that right; the game only has three levels. Each one takes about seven minutes to run through, maybe 15 if it's your first time. That's means there's less than an hour of gameplay for the entire game.\n\nBut what about the mirror levels? Well okay, there are actually three more levels after you beat the first three, but I'd hardly consider them new levels. They're literally exactly the same as the first three levels, but reversed (instead of moving right, you move left). They have no new content, no new music, and no new bosses. It's just the same thing over again, except that this time, you move backwards. Oh and one more thing, the mirror levels have no checkpoints at all.\n\nAnd that's the reason only about 2% of players have actually completed the mirror levels: no checkpoints means that one mistake will send you all the way back to the very beginning. At this point, the game turns from fun into frustrating. I guess that may appeal to some hardcore gamers, but for most people, it's not worth their time doing something that isn't even fun.\n\nI really wished there would be more levels; having only three is just pitiful. After you beat the third boss, the game looks like it goes into a "3D" mode for a bit. That could've been a cool way to start off the next levels. Too bad it didn't.\n\nAs much as I wanted to write a positive review for this game, because I loved the three levels it did have, I simply cannot recommend a game that has so little content. Minimalistic design is ok, but minimalistic content is not.\n\nTL;DR: Great game, but there's not even an hour of content (unless you're a masochist willing to play the mirror levels, then there's a few more hours of frustrating content). Now I know $5 isn't very much, but neither is <1 hour of gameplay. If the game had an OST bundled with it, then it might be worth it. But sadly it doesn't.","April 25, 2015","false","5.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zaphite/recommended/242820/","zaphite","Zaphite","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zaphite/","486 products in account","140 is a rythm platformer that is generally enjoyable but ultimately falls short of being a better game due to its very short length.\n\nThe Good:\nThe art style is very simplistic and consists almost completely of basic shapes, but is still appealing and the background and other objects in the game move and interact with the music. The music is upbeat and works well with the rythm aspect of the gameplay, which consists mostly of timing your jumps and some puzzle solving in order to progress through the level. As each level progresses the music gets more complicated with different sounds that in turn correspond to platforms and hazards in the level, so that you can use the music and sounds to time jumps and plan movements. The controls are great and work perfectly with a keyboard, which is what I used to play.\n\nThe Bad:\nThe biggest downside is that this game is extremely short, I managed to complete the three levels in the game in under an hour. This game is $5 and the amount of content provided is not enough to constitute the asking price. After completing the three levels there are 3 more versions of the levels that have increased challenge as you only have one life to complete the whole level, rather than having many checkpoints like in the first three levels. This is better than nothing but personally they become a bit too difficult with only one life and is still not enough content for $5.\n\nAlthough it is a good game, I would definitely recommend purchasing this game in a sale. I got it in a bundle for a greatly reduced price and really enjoyed the gameplay it offered despite it leaving me wanting more, which could at least be considered proof that the gameplay was engaging.","November 13, 2015","true","1.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It does have a twist to it, rather than it just being insanely difficult. You have to use the background sounds and music to time your actions. The great advantage of this is that, unlike other "hard platformers", it isn't just one massive kaizo trap that needs you to do trial-and-error. It is theoretically possible to use the music cues to complete a level in a single run (which is a challenge unlocked once you complete the game).\n\nI think the way the game used this mechanic was very well executed. The level design is simple enough that you don't get distracted by every little thing, but it doesn't look boring, (which is a problem in a lot of "minimal design" type games these days). The syle is reminiscent of Thomas was alone, with simple geometric shapes and flat colours.\n\nDefinitely a game worth playing if you're into the hard platformer types, but probably worth avoiding otherwise.","November 15, 2015","true","1.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I just played this game from start to end this evening, and I'm totally blown away. The amazing soundtrack is still playing in my head, which is also a quite important element of the game. The soundtrack I mean, not my head. The graphics are very enjoyable as well. They fit perfectlly with the music, and they're both super tight, crispy and geometric. And the colours are  beautiful. I would say that this has been one of the greatest game experiences I've had. Another great thing about 140 is the difficulty. It's not easy. The last battle in 140 (no spoilers) was one of the hardest moments I've had in gaming. It's difficult in another way than most puzzle platformers, because you have to really be in sync with the rhythm and in the end you have to kind of split your brain in two in order to win. At least that's what I experienced. That made it very satisfying to finally beat it in the end, after I'd done it over and over and over and ended up in a more or less meditative state of mind.\n\nSkip this paragraph, if you haven't played the game and don't want a spoiler. I haven't beaten the mirror part of the game yet. That's the one with no checkpoints. And I don't think that I'll be able to, at least not the third (or sixth) level, it's simply too hard. I've beaten games like Megaman, VVVVVV and Metroid 2, but at least they have save systems all the way through. Hopefully I wont miss too much by not beating the mirror part, it seems to be the same as the normal part, but there might be surprises. Hopefully I'll find out one day.\n\nThe next thing I do after writing this review is finding that soundtrack. I've heard that it's made by Bjørn Svin, who's a really cool Danish electronic musician, but it's hard to find any info on it. The game is Danish, I'm sure of that. It's made by some of the guys from Playdead behind Limbo (which is also a seriously amazing game). And one last thing: Remember to play this game with the best speakers or headphones you got in your house, it deserves it.\n\nEdit:\nThe soundtrack is not by Bjørn Svin, as I've been told. It's made by Jakob Schmid, who's also from Playdead. Here's his soundcloud:\nhttps://soundcloud.com/schmid\n\nI found this nice little article about the game that tells about the people behind it. One of the graphic designers apparently made a music video for Bjørn Svin, so maybe that's the source to the misunderstanding. Here it is:\nhttp://aiaiai.dk/blog/140-the-rhythm-based-minimalist-platform-game\n\nAnd here's a thread in which he's promised to write, when ever he is done with fine tuning the soundtrack (on the last page there's also a link to an unofficial soundtrack made by one of the commenters):\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/242820/discussions/0/792924412012466475/","January 6","true","2.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cublikefoot/recommended/242820/","cublikefoot","cublikefoot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cublikefoot/","2402 products in account","Full review: http://www.cublikefoot.com/review/140-cub-game-review/\n\nI’ll admit it, 140 surprised me. I’ve played quite a few platformers in my time, but this… this was an experience. In a nutshell, 140 is a very minimalistic platformer set to the rhythm of upbeat electronic music. It is quite challenging at times and requires “rhythmic awareness” in order to pass the levels.\n\nGamepaly is where 140 shines. I had a lot of fun with the various platforming mechanics of this game, some of which I’ve never seen before. It’s interesting that your one enemy is this “static” and, upon touching it, your immediately reset to your last checkpoint. There was one segment where the static was forming into blocks that the player had to jump on, but, in coordination with the beat of the song playing, these blocks would shrink back to a smaller block. The catch here was that while the block was shrinking or enlarging, it would be static. This mechanic was used effectively in the third level, the last level. I did notice that the last level seemed to ramp up the difficulty quite a bit, compared to the pace that the first two levels were going at. The last boss “battle” was utterly brutal to complete and required quick acting, or you’d have to restart the fight. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but the difficult should have been panned out better over the three levels of the game, instead of throwing it all into the last level. The game also has another mode, which I was told is “hardcore” mode. I played a bit of this mode, not knowing what to expect. Upon death in hardcore mode, I was kicked to the main menu of the game. In order to beat hardcore mode, you’ll have to go through it all without dying. Yep, that sounds hardcore enough for me, a little too hardcore. I was unable to complete hardcore mode and quit after five or six tries. Overall, the gameplay was challenging, unique, and kept me entertained.\n\nThe graphics of 140 might turn a few people away, but I assure you, they fit very well with the gameplay. I’m glad the game was chosen to have this minimalistic style, its been my first exposure to an art style like this. The vibrant colors and the varying shapes of the player sparked my interest in the game to begin with, well, along with the fact that the music was awesome too. When idling, the player remains as a square, when moving, a circle, and, when jumping, a triangle. These shapes fit well with the task that they’re assigned to now that I think about it, square remains flat and is not easily moves, circle can roll, allowing movement, and the triangle allows for easy landing opon a surface. The background seen in the game appears to follow the beat of the music as well, which is quite nice. Overall, minimalistic graphics = win.\n\nThe sound and music in the game was very catchy, working very well with the other aspects of the game. The game even won an IGF award for excellence in audio, which was well-deserved. I believe that the title of the game is also derived from the BPM of the music playing, I found quite interesting. I’m probably going to go looking for the soundtrack after I write this, if it exists. Anyways, the audio was excellent! Nothing much to say about the controls here. I used an Xbox 360 controller during my playthrough. The game has only a few actions: move, jump, and exit. In my case, an analog stick, the A button, and the pause button. Very simple, nothing needing changing here, easy to understand controls.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pN7M00auP0","November 25, 2013","true","1.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/novalinnhe/recommended/242820/","novalinnhe","novalinnhe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/novalinnhe/","425 products in account","140 is a deceptively simple-looking 2D platformer, where you play as a silently morphing geometric shape attempting to collect all the shiny things and dodge all the obstacles. Pretty standard platformer fare, although the little twist on this one is that everything moves to the beat. I enjoy myself a good rhythm game - here's lookin' at you Space Channel 5 - so it's a pet peeve of mine when a "rhythm" title has nothing to show for it other than a few elements moving to a basic pulse. From the screenshots I assumed 140 would be a prime example of that, but was proven wrong almost as soon as I started the first level.\n\nThere is no screenshot in the world that can truly demonstrate how flawless the rhythmic aspects of this game are. Everything responds to the music both technically and visually, whether it's the way an object moves, how it changes aesthetically to "describe" a sound, or how the background music morphs, builds and fires off as you plunge further forward. It also offers a whole lot of rhythmic complexity, so if you were expecting to breeze through by counting 1-2-3-4 then brace yourself - we're talking tied notes, dotted rhythms and syncopation with this one. Finally, I especially loved some of the fantastic audio-visual moments that this game offers up, which I won't spoil but can guarantee you'll love seeing if you happen to be musically minded.\n\nGetting worried that I'm talking about music and rhythm a lot? I wouldn't worry too much. The game is still playable if you find it hard to clap in time; it just means that certain obstacles will feel much, much harder to get through as the answer almost always involves just listening. Thankfully, the default levels come with unlimited deaths and generous checkpointing, so as long as you aren't aiming for every achievement you'll be fine.\n\nSo, the final verdict? 140 is a solid testimony to the rhythm-crossover genre, and I would recommend it to anybody who enjoys a rhythm game. I'd also give it a try if you're just looking for something a little different to play, as I'm not sure I've ever seen a game like this before. However... the second I post this review I will be uninstalling the game and never playing it again. Funny considering I'm singing such high praises of it, right? Yeah, well - you know that little 'as long as you aren't aiming for every achievement' disclaimer I made in the previous paragraph?\n\nI have every achievement.\nNever.\nAgain.","July 7, 2015","true","5.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","2"

On the surface the idea of a side scrolling platformer that goes along with the beat of the music sounds fantastic, and I was really excited to play it.\nThe unfortunate side is that because of the way the level reacts to the music, your actions and button presses need to actually be off beat with the music the vast majority of the time. This really breaks the flow of the game. I had to try platforms again and again because my brain automatically assumed my actions would need to go along with the beat, but often times that led me to my death.\nI enjoyed the music, and the visual style was pretty cool, but in the end the frustrating timing ruined it for me.","February 23, 2014","false","0.9"," 16 of 30 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","16","30","0","1"

Instead of just doing things in rhythm, you need to really grasp how everything going on around you ties in with the music, then move through obstacles using that understanding.  Sometimes it seems like you're not going to make it, but if you've listened well, things will fall into place right as you need them to.  140's minimalism really puts the focus on the music and gameplay as well.  You're never left wondering if you need to pay attention to something.\n\nThe only downside, as others have noted, is that it's a pretty short game. There are six levels, and the last three are basically harder versions of the first three.  It almost makes the game feel like a proof of concept, though a very enjoyable and well-executed one.  If there is ever a more developed follow-up released, I'll buy it as soon as I find out about it.\n\nOverall, I'm glad I bought it, and recommend it even at full price ($5 as of this writing).

Most people don't like this game because of how short it is, but it put it this way: If somebody hears a song, and they love it, then naturally they want to hear it again. Once they're tired of the song, they take a break, then later they just might want to hear it yet again. 140 is a game that revolves around sound. It's like a song that you listen to that goes at your pace, and if it gets stuck in you head, then you (naturally) want to hear it again, so you decide to replay a level. If this goes on long enough, the game won't be short at all, it will actually last for as long as you want it too. I really enjoy this game, and the price seems just fine for me.

Rhythmic awareness is required to overcome obstacles controlled by an energetic, yet melancholic electronic soundtrack."\n\nThe description of the game says everything. I love this game, makes you wanna replay it almost every time.\nThe main game itself is short, though the unique puzzles makes it really fun to replay. The boss battles in this game is also truly amazing. Had a blast with all of them, and I spend most of the time replaying it over and over because I can't get it over with. The level transition is also pretty amazing. It keeps the gameplay smooth and fluid. For a game made using Unity, seeing this makes me wanna develop more games in Unity. And I'll probably be using it for future Ludum Dares. Great game, great engine, a must buy if you love games like this\n\nThe Music is fantastic. I'm really looking forward to the OST release. It syncs so well with the levels, and it's the core function of the game which is no doubt an actual "rhythm platformer". The platforms will sync well with the music. I recommend using headphones when playing this.\n\nThe best part of the game is the mirrored/inverted levels. Basically it's the same levels as the main ones but it's inverted and there's no checkpoints. So it functions like a no-death run. Considering how difficult the puzzles/platforms are, it requires quite alot of skills to beat them. You'll feel great when you beat one of those levels.

That's probably a great way to enter it, because it turns out it's actually a well crafted little platformer.\n\nLike many other great platformers that strike a balance between challenging, inventive, and not too long (VVVVVV, Thomas Was Alone, Limbo all accomplish this in different ways), 140 is a very nice little game.\n\nThere is a sort of rhythm component, in that the music will assist you in timing a jump or move just right with the soundtrack. But aside from that, it's just simple, clean, and nicely honed gameplay that makes this game definitely enjoyable. The jumps feel weighty and good. The responsiveness of a stop is very comfortable.\n\nThe charmingly inventive character is a great touch. A square when you're still, a circle when you're moving, and a triangle when you jump, with nicely flowing animation between shapes. The simplicity really works in favor of 140, rather than against it.\n\nThe only part of the game configuration I'm not a huge fan of, is where save-points exist. Only after you complete each grouping does the game save. I'd love to take a break and come back to the final stage for example, but I have to play the several levels beforehand each time I want to get to that level for example. Not a dealbreaker in a game of this size and scope, but annoying if you can't devote enough time to completion of a group of levels in one sitting.\n\nThe game isn't much more than a few hours (you can play it through the first three stages, then in reverse direction back through those same stages). But those are well made hours, and only the final stage is really punshing (for me it's equivalent to a mental tongue twister, which I find too frustrating to see through). I didn't finish it entirely, got to the final level, and maybe I'll try again one day, but I don't know... The remaining 90% of the game though is worth the time.","July 12, 2014","true","1.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It doesn't sound like anything special but its execution is excellent. Controlling the game is easy. Your low speed and high acceleration make every move easily predictable. Every challenge is layed out before you in a way that allows you to almost instantly know what to do to overcome it. There was never death that I felt was unfairly due except perhaps for the bosses. However, even those really were my fault. The feeling of unfairness just came from how overwhelmed I was by them on the first try.\n\nEvery motion in the game apart from yours is set to a steady rhythm. Obstacles move in time with the music and platforms appear on-beat. You are a geometric shape that changes as your state does. A circle while moving on the ground, a triangle while airborne and a square while standing still. Every level consists of simple, timed platforming during which you must, at regular intervals, collect a little pick-up (whose movement represents a mechanic you're about enable) and take it back to a specific point to progress. Each level culminates with a boss. All of which are slightly different but are all basically about avoiding obstacles thrown at you as opposed to the ones you jump at in the platforming sections.\n\nThe music is sort of recycled for use throughout the entire game. Specific elements of it are only heard when particular mechanics come in to play so it's not always entirely the same but it's definitely not a different song. Again, the exception to this is the bosses. They come whith their own musical flavours. Consistent with the rest of the game but separating them from the platforming sections and each other. This all works in the game's favour. The music feels a part of the game's design and it helps you play. It's also awesome music.\n\n'140' is very short, consisting of only three levels each taking around 20 minutes on the first try. The game does offer replayability to you through a mirror mode in which there are no checkpoints. I can easily see only a minority (although not necessarily a small one) being drawn in by this since, once you've beaten the game, you've seen and conqured every challenge. What more is there to do? Well, this "hard mode" poses its own challenge by asking you to remain consistent in your abilities for an entire level. Fail and you must start from the beginning. Even if you reach the boss.\n\nPersonally, I liked this. I seems a solid enough goal to aim for seeing as you know what's coming is simple timing and fairly easy platforming. Even the bosses aren't as fraustrating a second time. If the game hadn't set this challenge for me, I might not have decided to try it but since it did, I gladly took it on.\n\n'140' is an enjoyable distraction. If you liked things like 'Thomas Was Alone', 'Element4l', or 'Limbo', you could probably get into this.","July 6, 2014","true","7.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

There is no tutorial but the aim is straightforward: collect small, circular objects to unlock the next stage without making contact with the static (you'll die and get blasted by a quick dubstep drop if you do).\n\nThe rhythm-synced puzzles are unique and steadily increase in difficulty as you go along. "Bosses" mark the end of each level and are appropriately challenging. There are save points before most (if not all) of the puzzles so there's no need to worry about redoing the entire level after a death; if you quit in the  middle of a level and close out of the game, however, you will have to restart the stage. The controls are simply the directional keys and the set-up options should ensure smooth play on any machine.\n\n140 is an indie gem that warrants a play by any lover of challenging platformers. Though the levels may be somewhat short, mirror mode will keep you occupied for the times those beat-'em-up/FPS/hack-and-slasher what-have-yous just won't cut it. Snap this up at half price and entertain the little masochist in you.\n\nNOTE: 140 features bright colours and quick-moving, flashing, and/or warping sequences.

This all works in the game's favour. The music feels a part of the game's design and it helps you play. It's also awesome music.\n\n'140' is very short, consisting of only three levels each taking around 20 minutes on the first try. The game does offer replayability to you through a mirror mode in which there are no checkpoints. I can easily see only a minority (although not necessarily a small one) being drawn in by this since, once you've beaten the game, you've seen and conqured every challenge. What more is there to do? Well, this "hard mode" poses its own challenge by asking you to remain consistent in your abilities for an entire level. Fail and you must start from the beginning. Even if you reach the boss.\n\nPersonally, I liked this. I seems a solid enough goal to aim for seeing as you know what's coming is simple timing and fairly easy platforming. Even the bosses aren't as fraustrating a second time. If the game hadn't set this challenge for me, I might not have decided to try it but since it did, I gladly took it on.\n\n'140' is an enjoyable distraction. If you liked things like 'Thomas Was Alone', 'Element4l', or 'Limbo', you could probably get into this.","July 6, 2014","true","7.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

That's probably a great way to enter it, because it turns out it's actually a well crafted little platformer.\n\nLike many other great platformers that strike a balance between challenging, inventive, and not too long (VVVVVV, Thomas Was Alone, Limbo all accomplish this in different ways), 140 is a very nice little game.\n\nThere is a sort of rhythm component, in that the music will assist you in timing a jump or move just right with the soundtrack. But aside from that, it's just simple, clean, and nicely honed gameplay that makes this game definitely enjoyable. The jumps feel weighty and good. The responsiveness of a stop is very comfortable.\n\nThe charmingly inventive character is a great touch. A square when you're still, a circle when you're moving, and a triangle when you jump, with nicely flowing animation between shapes. The simplicity really works in favor of 140, rather than against it.\n\nThe only part of the game configuration I'm not a huge fan of, is where save-points exist. Only after you complete each grouping does the game save. I'd love to take a break and come back to the final stage for example, but I have to play the several levels beforehand each time I want to get to that level for example. Not a dealbreaker in a game of this size and scope, but annoying if you can't devote enough time to completion of a group of levels in one sitting.\n\nThe game isn't much more than a few hours (you can play it through the first three stages, then in reverse direction back through those same stages). But those are well made hours, and only the final stage is really punshing (for me it's equivalent to a mental tongue twister, which I find too frustrating to see through). I didn't finish it entirely, got to the final level, and maybe I'll try again one day, but I don't know... The remaining 90% of the game though is worth the time.","July 12, 2014","true","1.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In fact, it has the appearance of a passion project coded over a few weeks' work in XNA, and that's exactly why you should love it. (That's about the right origin story too, it was made by one of Playdead (Limbo)'s coders afterhours.)\n\nMore importantly than any of that fluff however, and the core of this game's experience: its audio design. It won that IGF award for good reason; the music is great, the sounds are entrancing, and everything audio is well-implemented. Collecting items, landing on platforms, and nearing the game's checkpoint-like floating objects are all incredibly unique, rewarding, and expertly-crafted. The game plays well - as someone else suggested, its similarity to Bit.Trip Runner ends at the conceptual: this game gives you more control, and feeds back more information to you. You really do have more control, to take things at your pace, to screw up as you will.\n\nThe game is short and sweet and well worth the $2.50 I paid. I figured it was going to be quite short, but I've already spent quite a decent amount of time with it (more than my short attention span tends to spend on games) - if you like electronic soundscapes and platformers, you'll like this one.\n\nIt is very minimalistic/barebones however.

It doesn't sound like anything special but its execution is excellent. Controlling the game is easy. Your low speed and high acceleration make every move easily predictable. Every challenge is layed out before you in a way that allows you to almost instantly know what to do to overcome it. There was never death that I felt was unfairly due except perhaps for the bosses. However, even those really were my fault. The feeling of unfairness just came from how overwhelmed I was by them on the first try.\n\nEvery motion in the game apart from yours is set to a steady rhythm. Obstacles move in time with the music and platforms appear on-beat. You are a geometric shape that changes as your state does. A circle while moving on the ground, a triangle while airborne and a square while standing still. Every level consists of simple, timed platforming during which you must, at regular intervals, collect a little pick-up (whose movement represents a mechanic you're about enable) and take it back to a specific point to progress. Each level culminates with a boss. All of which are slightly different but are all basically about avoiding obstacles thrown at you as opposed to the ones you jump at in the platforming sections.\n\nThe music is sort of recycled for use throughout the entire game. Specific elements of it are only heard when particular mechanics come in to play so it's not always entirely the same but it's definitely not a different song.

But it turns out you dont need those things if you got good music and a game worth playing. I think some of the negative reviews might be from the games simplicity but the programmers werent lazy, they just knew what the game needed and what it didn't. The gameplay is based off obstacles that are in sync with the beat of the music. The more "in the zone" you are the better you'll be able to time your jumps and your movements. The music really makes the game and is best listened to loud enough to properly enjoy it, or at least use headphones because the music really is half the game. The game progresses in difficulty nicely, and there is a boss battle and the end of each level.

I had the most trouble with the first boss, which took me roughly 5 hours to beat with a somewhat older computer, but don't let that put you off!

In fact, it has the appearance of a passion project coded over a few weeks' work in XNA, and that's exactly why you should love it. (That's about the right origin story too, it was made by one of Playdead (Limbo)'s coders afterhours.)\n\nMore importantly than any of that fluff however, and the core of this game's experience: its audio design. It won that IGF award for good reason; the music is great, the sounds are entrancing, and everything audio is well-implemented. Collecting items, landing on platforms, and nearing the game's checkpoint-like floating objects are all incredibly unique, rewarding, and expertly-crafted. The game plays well - as someone else suggested, its similarity to Bit.Trip Runner ends at the conceptual: this game gives you more control, and feeds back more information to you. You really do have more control, to take things at your pace, to screw up as you will.\n\nThe game is short and sweet and well worth the $2.50 I paid. I figured it was going to be quite short, but I've already spent quite a decent amount of time with it (more than my short attention span tends to spend on games) - if you like electronic soundscapes and platformers, you'll like this one.\n\nIt is very minimalistic/barebones however.

Heard something called that before? You may be ready to write this off already, but please read on:\n\nIn 140, every single object in the game relates to the soundtrack. Every single voice in the soundtrack has a corresponding physical manifestation in the game world. This tightly woven relationship is the core of 140, and what makes it so brilliant and euphoric to play.\n\nLevels are split into layers or sections, and their progression reminds me a bit of Rez. The anticipation while one layer of the world peels away and another, more complex layer, is put on top. I love that transition!\n\nThe graphics are simple by design. They are often called "ugly", but I find the palettes were chosen with care and nothing grates. Your primary focus is on listening to the world and figuring out how to traverse it using the auditory hints.\n\nIf you love brutal/precision platforming, this is for you.

There is no tutorial but the aim is straightforward: collect small, circular objects to unlock the next stage without making contact with the static (you'll die and get blasted by a quick dubstep drop if you do).\n\nThe rhythm-synced puzzles are unique and steadily increase in difficulty as you go along. "Bosses" mark the end of each level and are appropriately challenging. There are save points before most (if not all) of the puzzles so there's no need to worry about redoing the entire level after a death; if you quit in the  middle of a level and close out of the game, however, you will have to restart the stage. The controls are simply the directional keys and the set-up options should ensure smooth play on any machine.\n\n140 is an indie gem that warrants a play by any lover of challenging platformers. Though the levels may be somewhat short, mirror mode will keep you occupied for the times those beat-'em-up/FPS/hack-and-slasher what-have-yous just won't cut it. Snap this up at half price and entertain the little masochist in you.\n\nNOTE: 140 features bright colours and quick-moving, flashing, and/or warping sequences.

If you’re into deep medi or minimal dubstep, then 140 then definitely check this out. As someone who listens to and mixes a lot of minimal dubstep, I didn’t even have to try to figure out what 140 means. The music basically has a meditative, dark, bassy, and psychedelic feel to it at 140 beats per minute. I highly recommend **subwoofers, quality speakers with great bass**, or quality headphones during gameplay. I always cranked up the volume to really feel the music.\n\n140 really forces you to exercise different parts of your brain simultaneously. That’s what made it tricky yet interesting for me. I had to focus on direction, shape, timing, and sometimes memorization all at once. You basically have to find equilibrium in concentrating on all of those aspects.  However, it is easy to accidentally focus on one thing just a little too much. You’ll see what I mean when you get there. That last segment of the third level almost drove me insane!!! I literally felt like I was going crazy with those rotating arrows. I probably was. I loved and hated it at the same time. It felt psychedelic!\n\n140 was developed by the same designers of Limbo. I sort of had the feeling due to the similar simplicity of the visual design, which I really admire This balances well with the simplicity of sound. 140 is a two-dimensional design comprised of a circle, triangle, square, and rectangle. The developers kept color theory in mind, as different colors or lack of colors went well with the tone of the music. The colors are flat, but chosen in such a way to balance well with the music.\n\n140 is more complex than it appears. The deeper you get into each level, the more rhythmic concentration is required to complete each level.  If you’re musically inclined and have appreciation for minimal dubstep, you’ll probably really enjoy this.\n\nAs you progress through the game, so do the rhythmic sounds. They begin with a simple low frequency samples, then get layered with more beats as you encounter different segments of the levels.  Within these segments, there are various obstacles that animate to the beat of the rhythm.  As the beats layer, so do the obstacles. This really kept me locked in.\n\nHowever, this is also what made it tricky. As I was feeling the sounds, I had to stay focused. I’ll be playing and sometimes I wanna start dancing or nod my head to the beat. There were times when I had briefly memorize a beat or move in a rhythmic manner to overcome obstacles. This is why I think it’s helpful if you’re musically inclined and/or you pay close attention to the sound of music. The slightest wrong movement can throw you off. So it’s important to really listen and observe what the obstacles are doing and where you’re located. Also pay attention to patterns.\n\nAlso, as someone who gets distracted easily, I really had to force myself to stay concentrated. I actually think this is a great exercise for anyone who wants to improve their focus.\n\nHOWEVER\n\nThink twice before completely exiting the game in the middle of a level (holding ESC). You will only be able to start from the beginning of the level(s) once you completely escape. So if you’re playing Level 2 and you escape in the middle of Level 2, you will have to start at the beginning of Level 2 once you reopen 140. However, it the levels after you surpass each one (there's only 3 levels).\n\nLuckily, you can continue after your last checkpoint if you didn’t completely escape.\n\nYou also cannot pause.\n\nAs annoying as that was, it kept me playing and forced me not to give up so easily. This has really sharpened my concentration and I hope they release more levels or some kind of addition.\n\nLet me know how it goes if you guys start playing. It's a fair price too.\n","November 7, 2013","true","14.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is brilliant in just about every regard. It involves jumpy shapes and procedurally generated music.\n\n\nMusic - 25/10: Yes, it's that good. The entire game revolves around the music. All the puzzles in this game are based on the fluctuations the music is going through. Everything is really seamless; if you're just listening to the audio and you die somehow, it honestly sounds like part of the song even though it's very harsh static. The music also only progresses when you do, which in my opinion is one of the best things about the game - and it always sounds so seamless when it does. And besides, the "drop" that happens when you progress to the next sequence of a stage is one of the most amazing sounds I've heard so far.\n\nArt - 6/10: The art style is a bit like Thomas Was Alone, but not quite as nice. It's basically just a bunch of rectangles and circles and triangles. Nothing much. However, there are some really tiny details, like the jump and the level progression sequence. It does have a sort of odd charm to it though, which is why I'm giving it a 6 and not something lower\n\nGameplay - 8/10: You're essentially just trying to navigate your way through a series of obstacles and static-y square things. Nothing too special when considered by itself, but when you add the music to the equation, it's phenomenal. Everything changes based on what's going on in the music, for example, platforms will start moving as a new sequence is added to the ever-changing song. Really, the only negative is that the boss battles are a bit more trial-and-error than actually puzzle based, but honestly that's not a bad thing.\n\nPrice - 10/10: At $5, this game is a steal. Hell, I wouldn't mind if I had to pay $15 for it; it's just that good. If you're still not convinced, get it on sale when it's somewhere hovering around the $3/$4 range. You'll be glad you did.\n\n\nOverall Rating - 9.5/10: This isn't so much of a game as it is an experience. The music is so much more than brilliant, and the gameplay and art style works fantastically well with the concepts it's working towards. The only downside I would say would be the shortness of it all - it only has three "stages", but they're all intuitively designed and great fun to play.","December 4, 2013","true","4.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has a very progressive gameplay, orchestrated by an awesome soundtrack. There's a lot of good ideas, and I was really amazed everytime I came across a new game mechanic.\nBUT it lacks content, and you can finish it in regular mode in 1 hour (Only 3 levels, each one with a boss at the end).\nThere's a mirror mode, which is kinda hard since all checkpoints are desactivated, but it's still the same levels you've already done.\n\nSo, it's a very intense but short game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/242820/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","140 is a very "primitive" platformer, if not for the seemless implementation of the music into its level design.\nIt's great to see such a concept used this well and while simple, and very short, it's almost perfect it what it does.\n\nBeware, I beat the game in about 1 hour. After that, you'll have an added challenge which I'll try later, but it does not seem to add much to the game, except for the challenge. (More on that later)\n\nThe game has 3 level, each with a Boss Fight in the end. 3 levels may seem waay too few content, but it's not quite like that. Basically, you'll unlock parts of the levels as you progress. You can see it as 3 chapters, but every level is integrated in the same space, which is essential in this game!\n\n\nAs usual, presentation!\n140 has a very minimalist art style, with psychadelic color schemes, and even some glitchy-ness to it. It's not your typical "2D retro pixelated graphics" that lots of game are using. Not at all. This game stands on its own, even regarding the art style.\nIt never gets too intrusive, presenting all the information you need very clearly.\nI really liked it! Besides, the background also pulses in sync with the music, so it adds to the whole "atmosphere".\n\nIt's hard to talk about its music without talking about the gameplay at once! All I can say for now is that I enjoyed the music for this game. It's pretty much electronic dance music, but there's more to it than that.\n\nAs I said before, it's a primitive platformer. Well, kind of.\nAll your character does is move to left and right, and jump. The jump time it also always the same, no wall jumping, no double jumping, no gliding, nothing of the sort. It's as simple as it gets.\nWell, how can you still make an unique game with that?\nMusic!\n\nSimilarly to Beatbuddy, this game uses music to its full potential. Every obstacle in the game is coordinated with the beat of the music, which makes this game all about timing.\n\nAnother game you can take in mind is BitTrip Runner (and the BitTrip franchise in general) regarding how it does its music. You're given layers of the songs as you progress through the game. It starts off with a very simple beat. And it builds on it, introducing new layers with the new obstacles. And it works perfectly!\n\nI've been interested in how music can be integrated into gameplay for a while, and this game is a really, really good example!\n\n\nAnother noteworthy aspect about 140, is the way it teaches you about every obstacle. It never throws something very complicated at you, before explaining what it does, exclusively through gameplay. And music, ofcourse!\nSometimes, you'll hear a new melody in the background, and you'll immediately know that you have to look for something around you. And you'll usually be presented with a very simple obstacle, to give you a general idea of how it works. Only then, come the bigger challenges.\nI never found it frustrating at all. It was a bit too easy, maybe, due to the very forgiving checkpoints (which I don't exactly mind). But if you're fond of challenge due to the lack of those, do not fret!\nAfter you beat the game, you'll unlock 3 new levels. These are the previous 3 levels, but mirrored, and without checkpoints.\n\nEvery big level, is made up of smaller levels. Each time you complete a smaller "level", something else will start moving, and with it comes a new layer of music. And that's pretty much how the game works. You just keep going to new areas until you reach the Boss fight.\nIt is indeed very simple, but also very effective! The way you need to pay attention to the rhythm of the music to overcome challenges, the way even the background contributes to that, it all comes together and gets you very in tune with the game. It's surprisingly immersive, and has a very good flow!\n\nAnother thing I've found great, was the Boss fights! There are only 3, but they play really differently to one another. They're almost minigames, and reminded my of something like SuperHexagon. The surreal visuals, coupled with the music, and twitch gameplay... yeah.\nBut it's good! And it's not actually like SuperHexagon, only those elements. They're also timing based, and they do a great job of teaching you on the fly, with each phase getting progressively more complicated.\nIt really does follow the design of the rest of the game. They start out simple, presenting you how it works, and then they'll challenge you, all through the game, without any words.\n\nOne nice addition is also how they end the Boss Fights. After the crazy colors spinning around, and the hectic music from the bosses, it suddenly stops. You're back into the Hub world, where everything is silent and grey. It's a very well timed break to the flow of the game. Well done!\n\nI could see it being frustrating if the Boss fights are also a necessity to beat the Mirrored levels, without checkpoints, but I can't hold the game responsible. Its main content is accessible to everyone, and the rest is there to people fond of the old-school approach, I'm totally OK with that!\n\n\nAll in all, despite its length (again, 1hour, maybe even less, if you rush through it), this work is very, very well done. From its presentation, to its level design, and how it merges music and gameplay... I can't see much to complain about.\nI'm really surprised about it, great little game!\nIf you're a bit skeptical of the 5€ it costs... Well, maybe wait for a sale. But seriously, get this game and try it out, if you're into rhythm games, or platformers. It's definitely worth your time.","July 21, 2014","true","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It does have checkpoints within levels, which is always helpful with jumpers where death results from missing a platform in a jump.\n\nDid like the overall feeling of the game.  Not sure it is the work of art some reviewers claim it to be, but it is a very solid action platformer.

It's a rhythm-based platformer, but not in the way Bit.Trip Runner is. Runner (which I thought was kind of crap) is not so much of a platformer as an auto-runner where you have to do platformer-ish things in time with the music. 140 actually gives you full control of your character, while the elements of the levels (e.g. moving platforms, traps, etc.) move in time with the music. It manages to be not just a gimmick and important for getting a feel for the timing of some of the more evil things they throw at you later in the game, some of which are rather clever and made me happy in the same kind of way first playing Super Meat Boy did (which I still need to go back and finish one of these days).","December 22, 2013","true","1.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lyrit/recommended/242820/","Lyrit","Lyrit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lyrit/","167 products in account","To simplify what I think of this game, I'm splitting it into two major paragraphs: the first about the game and its first half, the second about specifically the second half of the game.\n\n140 is definitely a simple yet charming platformer, and although some may be turned off by such simplicity, I personally find it nice. The graphics, although minimalistic, represent the playing field and hitboxes well (so you don't have any "that shouldn't of hit me" moments) and have a nice colorful vibe. 140's graphics are like abstract art, and you'll either love it or hate it. As far as sound goes, the music was very enjoyable and fit the game very well -- up-beat with a strong rhythm. After playing the game, I legitimately wanted to find loops of some of the game's music online. In gameplay, 140 is as simple as its graphics, which again may either be a plus or minus to individuals. As a straight-up platformer, I personally find 140 great: it's not too hard, but it's not too easy, either. 140's platforming definitely takes some practice, but it's nothing impossible, and you really feel like you master it as you play it. The only bit of simplicity in 140's nature that I find disappointing is its shortness; discluding the second half of the game, which will be spoken about in a moment, there are only three stages, and they can be beaten in 1 to 2 hours. Although they're long and unique from another, I still feel like there could have been more stages.\n\nThe second half of the game is, again, a major deciding factor for what people think of this game. For those who aren't in the know: after beating the first three stages in 140, you can play the "mirror" stages. These mirror stages are literally just the first stages again except inverted (you go left instead of right, which makes no actual gameplay difference) and with no checkpoints (meaning you must do the entire stage and boss without dying once). I've always been picky about adding difficulty by simply removing checkpoints, and I feel that this second half of the game is directly on the line of what qualifies as good or bad in regards to this. I stand by my point that repeating sections of a stage that you've clearly mastered is only a time waste, and the mirror stages are definitely guilty of this; however, I have to admit that, upon beating the last mirror stage, I felt genuine excitement and achievement (Get it? Because there's an achievement...?). From the first half to the second, the game spikes in difficulty only due to the lack of checkpoints, and although it can be repetitious to redo the whole stage if you die, it is also incredibly rewarding to beat it. Even after beating all of the mirror stages, I still feel like having more unique stages would be far more enjoyable than just repeating what was already given without checkpoints; however, those with a strong urge to master the game might get some extra time and enjoyability out of the game via these stages. Otherwise, the mirror stages may feel unnecessary as an element to the game.\n\nIn total, after having beaten all of the game, I recommend 140. The only gameplay I would question is the second half of the game because of its easily repetitious gameplay (from restarting a whole stage over if you die). The overall atmosphere and style of 140 can only be praised or spited, and I, for one, fall into praising it. It was short, admittedly, but it was also sweet.","March 28, 2014","true","6.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tonakai/recommended/242820/","tonakai","Tonakai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tonakai/","293 products in account","Music is often used to set the feeling for a game. In horror games you can rarely be sure if what you hear is harmless ambience or the playable character's sanity (or your own) going nuts. In action games, the battle music vary from epic choirs to hard rock, but the goal is to make the player FEEL the battle - with intense and up-lifting sounds, as if something large is behind the sounds.\n\nRarely music is made for other reasons than that. 140 seeks to experiment other variations, and that it has definitely done well.\n\n140 is a rhythmic platformer game where the music guides you. It tells you how the environment warps, either for your favor or to kill you. Every time you catch one of those fleeing, round music machines and drag them to a check point, the world changes. The color theme changes, and the music gets a new addition while enhancing the already existing soundtrack. An another part of the level has now been unlocked, either by formerly static objects starting to move or you suddenly going all anti-gravity. Whatever happens, the new instrument in the concert that is 140's changing soundtrack tells you how do they work. Just don't forget that the music doesn't tell you when to jump!\n\n140 was mainly developed by a person also involved in LIMBO. While playing the game, I could really feel the fact when failing the outwardly simple yet mind-bending timing requiring platforming.\n\nThe game includes three stages with one boss for each. The boss fights are the moments where you REALLY get tested! And if after clearing the game once you still seek a challenge, you might want to try the mirror worlds, where you get only one attempt to clearing each level.\n\nIn other words and in short, despite the game being short and looking simple both graphically and gameplay-wise, it still manages to bring in fresh experiences with well thought-out design. It's a kind of a game that you have to play to understand its worth.\n\nHowever, as much as I want to blurt out fancy phrases to describe 140's greatness, it's still a short game. One can easily finish this game in one to two hours. But is that such a bad thing? I got the feeling that this game was experimental, and a well thought-out one, if I may be so shameful as to re-use my early wording. The price is also a good measurement of the game's length: the full price is a meekly $5, and every now and then I spot that it's on sale with 80 % off the price.\n\nIn short:\n- Simple yet challenging, but still doesn't make it seem like it's impossible\n- Fun boss fights that differ from usual platforming, even within this game itself\n- Graphically fluid and simple\n- The music, along with being used in a new way, is also pretty good 'n catchy!\n\nIf you thought platformers can not have anything new to offer, that everything has already been done, this game proves that there is still a lot to be done to reach that point.","October 18, 2015","true","9.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The first and second levels were really fun, and I liked how the music tied into the game.  The levels would change in time with the song so you could time your jumps accordingly.  Once I got to the third level, though, the game got really annoying.  It didn't seem like the levels were really in time with the music anymore, instead they beat to their own drum (which you couldn't hear).  It just ended up being spawn and die over and over.  One of the problems I have with the game is that if you are standing level with a static area (a kill area basically) you will die, even though you aren't actually in it.  This gets really annoying in the third level when you have to time your movements with these boxes expanding and contracting.  Another thing that I noticed is that your character always moves the same amount and ignores how much you move the left stick (on an xbox 360 controller at least).  It seems like it ignores anything <50% and treats anything >50% as equivalent to pressing A or D on the keyboard.  This also is really annoying when trying to deal with those expanding boxes.  So in short, if you want to have fun for like 60 minutes, go buy this game.

In Bit.Trip Runner (1&2), music is made by you dodging things in a static fashion. You are making the music the game wants you to make, by playing a "dodge the obstacles" running game. In BeatBuddy, the music dictates your movement, and the sound just happens around you. It's just part of the environment.\n\nBut in 140, the music doesn't force you to do anything. You don't need to listen to it to play the game, and you can move how you want. All of the obstacles, though, follow specific rhythms, set up by specific instruments throughout the music. You don't need to listen to it, or pay attention to it, or count the measures as you play. But if you hope to win, you're going to want to.\n\n140 doesn't force you into a game of Simon with a metronome. It presents to you the music, and you'll need to be deeply in touch with it to get through the game. It shows you that the bond between player and music has enormous benefits, and rather than building that connection for you, it gives you the tools to build it for yourself.\n\n140 is the first true rhythm game in a long time. It's the first one I've played where you actually need to understand what rhythm means. And it's a fantastic experience.","August 18, 2014","true","7.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There are three chapters, with each chapter having different objectives. You control a object that can shape shift between a square, triangle or circle. The goal in each chapter is to keep moving forward, collecting items and activating switches and platforming along the way. As you progress through the chapter the music will change. Some of the platforming can be challenging and can take a while to get right. One complaint is that there are no save points during chapters (only inbetween chapters) so when you quit and resume your game, you have to start at the begining of the chapter you were on. There are a total of 3 chapters for campaign as well as 3 challenge chapters which will test your skills.\n\nTo be a successful rhythm game you have to have good music. Does this game have good music? Well, yes it does. Audio is electronic pop which is not iritating to listen to.\n\nGraphics are presented in a 2D fashion.

If you've played LIMBO before, you're already familar with this creator's ability to marry simple controls with extremely clever level design. That same concept applies here. The style of this game is also oh-so appealing: It's an ode to retro gaming that still proves to look entirely modern. The electronic soundtrack—especially that infectious tite screen music—also nalls this ideal perfectly.

There are three chapters, with each chapter having different objectives. You control a object that can shape shift between a square, triangle or circle. The goal in each chapter is to keep moving forward, collecting items and activating switches and platforming along the way. As you progress through the chapter the music will change. Some of the platforming can be challenging and can take a while to get right. One complaint is that there are no save points during chapters (only inbetween chapters) so when you quit and resume your game, you have to start at the begining of the chapter you were on. There are a total of 3 chapters for campaign as well as 3 challenge chapters which will test your skills.\n\nTo be a successful rhythm game you have to have good music. Does this game have good music? Well, yes it does. Audio is electronic pop which is not iritating to listen to.\n\nGraphics are presented in a 2D fashion.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/recommended/242820/","thetitaniumdragon","TheTitaniumDragon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/","776 products in account","140 is a very short platformer game for the PC with a simple but distinctive aesthetic.\n\nStory\n\nThe game has no story.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe gameplay is mostly fairly simple, but really has two modes; there is the gameplay during the levels, and the gameplay during the “bosses”.\nThe levels are all full of fairly standard platforming elements; moving platforms, “spikes/lava” which takes the form of static, and various other simplistic elements. The game does mix these up somewhat, with blocks which trigger other blocks to appear or disappear, expanding and contracting blocks which hover in place but can crush the player, blocks which temporarily turn themselves into ground which will kill the player if they touch it, and, in one level, brief, periodic periods of anti-gravity, where the player will fall up (but cannot jump off the ceiling).\nThe game is quite brief, consisting of only three levels of increasing difficulty, and checkpoints are frequent – a very necessary feature in the third, quite difficult level of the game. The player must periodically retrieve floating orbs and bring them to platforms to transform the level in order to continue on their way through it, and each time the level grows deadlier and more complicated, until they have reached the end of it.\nAt the end of every level there is a boss of sorts, though in reality they are merely segments of very different gameplay. The first one is a fairly traditional boss which shoots at the player from above and splits in half every time the player shoots it with a little hovering shooter which fires automatically every few seconds, requiring the player to time their presence underneath the boss to harm them. The second one has the player navigating through an environment which feels like they are racing down a narrowing track as an enemy whose touch means death zooms back and forth past the player. The third and final one has the player trying to defend themselves from enemies, pointing their blaster at them before they attack; as the player only has one shot per group of enemies, they have to make it count. This last one is quite frustrating as it plays heavily with interface screw, first by making it so that the blaster rotates either 90 or 180 degrees before firing (in a predictable pattern), and secondly, by shifting around the entire screen and thus giving the player only a very tiny amount of time to react. This was the most frustrating part of the game, and was a poor design choice as it felt very awkward rather than like a fun puzzle.\n\nGraphics\n\nThe game has a very simple aesthetic to it; everything in the game is a geometric shape of some sort, and the player themselves turns from a triangle to a circle to a square depending on their movement and actions. Even the music is very simple, the game being silent at first, then gradually building up a more and more complicated soundtrack which beats in time with movements of objects in the environment.\n\nFinal Summary\n\nThe game is decent overall, but it is very short, and the third “boss” is quite obnoxious as the game experimented with interface screw in the place of interesting gameplay. On the whole the game was not terrible, but given its very short length, with the entire game likely taking no more than an hour to beat, and the frustrating final “boss”, there’s not a whole lot to recommend beyond its aesthetic.\n","November 6, 2014","false","1.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","2"

The degree of col♥♥♥♥♥♥ varies by level, but most of my experience was wrought with eye strain. For a very short game like this, you don't want a headache to be your lasting impression on the player.\n\nBeneath the pain is a fairly enjoyable precision platformer. The game doesn't have any real 'puzzles,' aside from figuring out where you need to go and not flunking the jump (which happens often), but the integration of the music is the real selling point. Hitting a checkpoint adds a new instrument to the soundtrack, and a new mechanic to the level tied to that instrument, and the mechanic is then used to progress.\n\nIt's a very compact experience, taking only an hour or two and sticking closely to its minimalist aesthetic. However, the levels really drag on; there are only three of them, and if the game runs you two hours, that's about 40 minutes per level. It's not too bad at first, since the checkpoints are quite frequent and there's hardly any delay to respawning and trying again. If the game ended after the third level, with no extra content, this would be an overall positive review; however, completing the main game unlocks a set of 'mirror levels,' and the game falls apart then.\n\nFirstly, the mirror levels invert all the colors, leading to even more obnoxious color palettes than before. Then you replay the same levels, butmirrored - an interesting idea, except now death starts you over from the beginning. Of what might be a 20+ minute level. Which will end with some sort of bullet-hell boss. And good luck spacing your jumps if you're trying to defend your eyes from a painful assortment of hot pinks and sun yellows.\n\nYou need to learn these levels deeply, and practice them often, and dedicate lots of time to completing them. This is the core problem with this segment of the game: it is a 1-2 hour experience that then demands significantly more commitment in order to 'complete' it. You don't HAVE to finish the mirror levels, but if you uninstall it then, have you really "completed" the game? Since you need to complete the mirror levels to unlock all the achievements, it suggests the devs don't think you've won until you've gone through that hell.\n\nIf you are content to play only half the game, you probably won't regret it. But overall, 140 does not respect the player's time, and as a result I won't recommend it.","June 29, 2015","false","2.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The music helps drive the player into moving and jumping at the right times, to over come obstacles. The music is quite smooth and soothing electronic tunes. Nothing too extreme.\n\nIn each of the levels, you're main objective is to go along and acquire a small floating ball, which starts to follow you after you've bumped into it.

New areas are accessible, static objects start to move and even the gravity can change.\n\nThe best part of this game, in my opinion, are the boss fights at the end of each level. Each one is well thought out, and brings a challenge to the player fighting them.\n\nIt's quite a short game, around 45 minutes to an hour, if you just want to play the base 3 levels.\n\nYou'll get a lot more time out of the game if you choose to do the 'advance' levels, which are mirror worlds of the first three, without any check points.

Minimalist abstract art and design at its best. Every puzzle is unique and rewarding. As I played I became more and more aware of the music until I was relying on it to progress.\n140 is a game with no filler. You must use everything you're given to solve the puzzles. But at the same time, this game is not your enemy trying to make you fail while you battle against it to win (like in most games e.g. your typical shooter or racing game), it is there to guide you through by teaching you as you go. When a new element is introduced in a puzzle game, so often I am just left to figure out myself what to do with it. In 140, you are subtly shown the mechanics of new elements before you must interact with them. This allows the player to always feel confident and in control. As the complexity and difficulty increased at just the right pace, I began to find some puzzles had a bit more too them than they seemed. I would have to watch as the elements reacted to the music and learn their patterns. Some of the puzzles may take you a minute or two to complete, but you are never confused for more than a few seconds. It’s the perfect mix of mental and physical skill.\nIf you’ve enjoyed games like Thomas Was Alone or The Impossible Game you will probably enjoy this.\n140/10\n","July 4, 2014","true","2.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"

A simple indie game for simple indie people.\n\nThis couldn't be further from the truth...\n\nI've just spent an hour getting passed what I thought to be the "last" level. Turns out, I'm only half way there. But my first playthrough was an enriching experience. The feedback loop the player recieves in the form of a changing soundtrack serves as an indicator of progression, and encourages you to keep going. This background mechanism combined with levels that layer on their complexity with each checkpoint the player completes, demonstrates a subtle mastery of game design and player psycology. 140 could have gone down the route of asking the player to hunt down the next check point, hiding them in places that require a good quarter of an hour to forage for - or a couple of minutes looking at youtube videos - but teh developer's focus on "here and now" gameplay, where reflexes matter more than cunning, make the game instantly accessible and addictive.\n\n140 is neither music game nor platformer: it surfs a gorgeous in-between. It doesn't require an instantanious on-tap supply of rythmic ability like titles such as Bit Trip: Beat or guitar hero. Essentially: you can play 140, and everyone will find it wonderfully challenging and fulfilling.","November 15, 2014","true","1.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Color that world with neon shades, sharp geometric landscapes and bind it together with minimalistic tech-house music. A world of stark beauty and remarkable simplicity; the player exists as a transforming piece of geometry - a square, triangle and circle altogether.\n\nThe geography of this flatland is not inert though. Environments comes to life in synergy with the music - music that is dependent on the player's progress in each of the three vistas. Can't make that jump? Well, the backing-track is probably missing an instrument; escorting a mysterious, floating orb to a docking station will add it to the soundtrack. Obstacles that were previously laying stubbornly static will come to life, rhythmically shifting all the way.\n\nGlide, jump, roll, and shoot - 140 is an auditory and visual delicacy.\n","January 4, 2014","true","3.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Don't get me wrong, this game provides an interesting and unique experiance; however, that experiance is not increadably unique, nor does it last more than an hour or so. There exist other rythem-based platformers on steam, many of which are worth the money you spend on them. If you already want to buy this game, you'll probably enjoy it. Hell, if you know nothing about this game you'll probably enjoy it, but at the end of the day you'll be stuck with 3 (or 5, after the sale) bucks out of your pocket and a completed game that has no replayability. There are many other games you can buy for the same amount that will exceed this game on those terms.

Not that this is a bad thing, but for what this game presents itself to be is rather boring with little to no replay value. The gameplay is rather weak and doesn't have much to sustain the player's interest. Although it is easy to tell the angle of this game is not gameplay but through the atmoshere and music. I have to admit the biggest redeeming quality of this game is he music which is quite good, but doesn't help in the department of pulling yourself through the game. The game is very short, clocking in at an hour at most, and feels like more could have been done.

Theres no story in 140 but the game is amazing none the less. 140 consists of three stages and three reverse stages. In the game you go throught enviroments to get a ball that unlcoks a portal to the next level which changes the colour and the music of the part of the stage. The game Also has a simple art style that works. The game has boss battles at the end of each stage which all of them are a great challenge. The game also has a mirror stage that increases the difficulty and makes the game insanely difficult. Now for the bad. The game is incredibly short. Many of the extra hours are because of the tought sections of the game. The mirror stages will grant you a longer time of the game because theyre pretty difficult. Overall 140 is a fun and cheap game that i suggest you check out. 140 is a great platformer also has a great soundtrack.

It isn't worth that much, even if it is only 5 bucks. The game is fun, and very interestingly designed.

My play time since then has been the mirrored versions of those levels. The mirrored versions are literally exact mirrors of the levels you already played, so there isn't anything really new or exciting.\n\nThe only difference is that dying in the mirrored levels returns you to the main area and you have to restart the level all over. If anything, that leads to a pain in the ♥♥♥ more than fun replay value.\n\nSo, initially, the game is enjoyable. And I would recommend you try it out. But get it for as cheap as possible. Spending 5 bucks on something I beat in 30 minutes and haven't really enjoyed since left a sour taste in my mouth.\n\nAgain, the time I played was enjoyable and intriguing.

You are expected to know to hit the up arrow twice, then you have a square on the ground. There are no options that I can find, so the controls are set as the arrow keys. When I was finished, I couldn't leave the game because I wasn't told that to close the game, you need to hold the escape key.

And when you do get bored, or rage quit, because you've played one section 20 times over, because that millisecond screws you over, guess what? You'll have to play the whole level over again to get back to that point!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/joe40001/recommended/242820/","joe40001","joe40001","http://steamcommunity.com/id/joe40001/","138 products in account","I almost never take the time to write a review of a steam game, most steam games I'm simply pleased with but not blown away, occasionally I'll write a positive review of a steam game I absolutely love. However, I don't believe I've taken the time to write a negative review of any steam game before this, so take all that into consideration when reading this review.\n\nDO NOT BUY THIS GAME\n\nForgive the caps lock but I had to be clear, this game is a very good example of what people mean when they call a game "indie" as a pejorative. Is it lazy? Yep. Is it self congradulatory? Yep. Is it overpriced and exploitative in design such that it takes a lot of time to beat just because of bad game design choices? Yep.\n\nThink what you will about "miminalism" but time and time again the indie community has shown that they believe it to mean "getting away with being lazy by calling it an artistic choice". This game uses solid colors like crazy, they aren't "beautifully rendered" solid colors, they are just solid colors. In every area of game design aside from the music (which is decent) this game cuts corners on production.\n\nFirst of all the mechanics consist of little more than basic "avoid hazards, time jumps". The hazards are a lazy static design. Honestly, this game looks a whole lot like what a game would look like if you set out with the idea of "making the game requiring the least amount of effort to make and charging the most money you could get away with". And you might suggest this is cynical or baseless, but think of this: This game does not have an options screen. You can adjust window size before playing but once you are in, you are in. Why doesn't this game have an options screen? Pretty much every game in the past 20 years has had an options screen, but for some reason this game is "above having an options screen".\n\nWhat nerve the developer must have to think so highly of this game. And now, for the coding, this game could be coded by most decent coders in a week or two. That's it! Compare that to a game like "The Binding of Isaac" a game with so much more depth and variety that most programmers couldn't even code or imagine. And take note, both games cost the same amount. That's the biggest insult is the price point. This game has THREE LEVELS. That's it, and how does the developer pad out the game with "additional content"? He adds THE SAME THREE LEVELS again but with the X axis inverted on the level.\n\n"Mirror mode" is acknowledged as incredibly easy to do, it's one line of code most of the time, inverting a level can be done in under a minute, it is absurdly easy, that's why some games have it as a "cheat code". Here, the almighty genius of a developer thinks so much of his game that he thinks these 3 inverted levels without checkpoints constitute "new levels".\n\nWhat really irks me though is that somehow some people seem to be buying into this game. Read the reviews, I can't wrap my head around it, are we really such sheep that this passes as a quality 5 dollar game? I can't imagine all those reviews are real, I don't want to believe I live in a world where so many people could be such suckers. This guy is selling the video game equivalent of snake oil and people are gobbling it up.\n\nTo everybody who loves this game, I have a suggestion: You can play games of superior quality like this online FOR FREE, google kongregate or newgrounds, or google some game jam like ludum dare where people make games in literally 3 days and the top 200 entries for any game jam will be better (and less lazy) than this game. AND they will be free. I know for a fact that this developer has made more than enough money scamming people with "minimalist" game design. The least he could do if he was going to be a lazy game designer is make it pretty. LIMBO is a pretty unremarkable game gameplay-wise, but at least it looked like the art took more that 2 seconds to make.\n\nBy this point I'd estimate most people have tuned out this review because it's quite long, but I had to make it and I had to make it long because I feel that passionately. Most of the indie game design community are very kind and selfless people they want their audience to enjoy their game. Here is the most damning thing about this game, and I truly believe it:\n\nI don't think the developer cares if you like their game, only if you buy it.\n\nI truly believe that, I got this game on some hefty sale and I still feel like I was ripped off. There are so many games of this and better quality online for free, this game has no art production value, very little innovation, and ONLY 3 LEVELS. It's a platformer with no art assets and only 3 levels that costs 5 bucks. Do you think a developer so selfish as to try to peddle such a scam of a game deserves any of your money?\n\nPlease do not buy this game, if for no other reason than to teach developers that they should care about their audience and not take advantage of them. Keep the indie community a better place by supporting good developers and not giving money to lazy exploitative developers such as this one.","June 14, 2014","false","2.2"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

The music is just straight up bad, and minimalism is used as an excuse for glitchy lo-fi tunes. In a good music based platformer you should feel like everything is moving naturally, and you should be moving in time with the beat. This game has you pausing to wait for a platform to reset constantly. And if you're a nanosecond off you will die.\n\nThe game also has 3 boss fights, each one more frustrating than the last. 1 is a bullet hell shoot, except you can only move slowly and jump, 2 is dodging an enemy that moves about .3 seconds before the beat, and the last one is like a rhythm game where you shoot in four directions...except that your aim moves away from where you are shooting ON PURPOSE, in addition to your targets moving at total random.","January 3, 2014","false","0.9"," 4 of 19 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","4","19","0","0"

You can cover the three levels in an hour, after which you can attempt to do them in mirror mode w/o checkpoints. This is the real test because when playing the levels for the first time, you can die as many times and therefore the importance of keeping the beat/rhythm may be lost on you. But when you play the levels in mirror mode, where every death sends you to the START of each level...you will learn how important keeping the beat is.\n\nIt is fairly priced for what it's worth.

It's a  very short  platformer with super minimal, but nice graphics.\n\nPros:\n- Once you beat the game once, it' gets difficult a second time. Similar to Super Meat Boy\n- Great soundtrack\n- The minimal graphics really work for the game\n- The concept and design are super abstract which keeps the game really unique\n- Great video style\n\nCons:\n- Difficult at the end (to each his own)\n- Requires headphones for the soundtrack to be sucessful\n- Extremely short maybe 2 hours of gameplay\n- Slightly repetitive\n\nOverall: Excellent indie game that could've been longer. I'm sure some people's reviews would change when that happened. The soundtrack and uniqueness of the game will keep you playing until the end. For $5 or less if it's on sale, the game is probably worth it just for the experience.\n\n\n\n","December 31, 2014","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not including the three after-levels, there are three levels in total (which I'll admit is too little) and they all have a little end boss which is very much not little at all. They are all challenging and will test your rythem and twitch skills to a very full capacity. The game never uses text or dialouge, everything is explained in game and the game trusts your intellect and instinct enough to figure it out yourself.\nAnd it does a damn good job at it.\nNothing in this game is based on luck. You'll never feel frustrated at "The game" (and if you do, you're wrong) because every time you die, it's on you.\n\nGameplay: The game is really tight (However there is less than a split second difference between when you push the jump key and you jump, which never ruins anything but cannot be truly called "tight" for this reason) and the quirks and mechanics of the game are all explained by playing it. Your own experience with this game will depend on your paitence, rythem skills, and ability to perceive and predict your enviornment. If you're used to games that hold your hands and tell you where to go and how to do what you need to do, and you don't want to play any other kind of game, then you will not like this. If you don't have a high pain tolerance, you will not like this game. If you aren't paitent, you really won't like this game.\nAnd that's okay, just don't bash this game for being "Luck dependant"\nAlso, this game has the hardest final boss I have ever played ever.\n\nAudio: Being a guy who makes music himself, I can appreciate this game's music well. It isn't at all complicated (I don't think I've heard a level with more than 6 tracks) but it all flows together perfectly, and the feeling of putting an orb in it's place and hearing the song get more complicated is perfect. The levels are heavily (but not totally) influenced by the music, and in some cases, you are too. I just wish this game came with the OST, but that is not something I can fault the game for.\n\nGraphics: No screenshot you will see of this game will do it justice. Almost every screenshot of this game will make it look like a bloody Atari game, and I agree, still, this game is very, very ugly.\nBut, you put it in motion and everything changes.\nEVERYTHING.\nThe way the (completley geometric) shapes change, to the beat of the music is wonderful, and the fludity of the world makes it feel alive, even if there are no human constructs in the world.\nIf you don't want to buy the game for the graphics, at least watch a video, perhaps that will do it more justice.\n\nAll in all, I would give this game a very high, (As in the only reason this game didn't get a 10 is for a few very miniscule gripes) 9/10. Would eat again.\n","November 26, 2014","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

On one hand, the various challenges and gorgeous visuals all tied into the beat of each level is implemented perfectly, offering a blissful yet difficult platforming experience that will leave a nice impression. On the other, even with the 5 dollar price tag, paying that much is a stretch for the little content provided. Consisting of only 3 levels, each about 5-10 minutes in length, 140 is stretched out through its increasing difficulty and bosses, which can last multiple times longer than the levels themselves, even with generous checkpoints.\n\nThe game shines brightest in the platforming sections, implementing the mechanics I've mentioned before and having a smooth difficulty curve that is never unfair, as you always know when it's your mistake. The first two bosses as well are decently balanced and don't take long to adapt and beat, even after a few tries, but it is the third and final boss that felt more of an excercise of frustration than any sort of challenge.\nThere is a method to the third boss' madness, but you have to adapt to a lot of variables to beat this one, even after you finally wrap your head around the constantly changing mechanics after every checkpoint.\n\nBeating this boss provides no payoff either, as there is no new content following, nor a nod to your accomplishment outside of the standard steam achievement. You do unlock mirrored versions of all three levels, which could be fun if they didn't turn off checkpoints. Getting all the way to a boss only to die and lose all your progress and gain elevated blood pressure is not my idea of fun. If you're excessively masochistic and want to have an awful day, go for those challenge levels, but otherwise 140 is a nice surprise that has some nice shining moments, even if it never lives up to its potential.\n\n","November 20, 2014","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It took me a little over an hour to beat the three levels (no doing them again in mirror mode with 1 life only does not count as adding extra levels) but the boss fights were quite interesting. Art style is both pretty and pretty basic, gameplay is very simple and the difficulty is not too bad. A few parts of the game are irritating such as the final form of the final boss but you should be able to beat it in one sitting.\n\nWould buy for $0.33 and 1/3rd of a cent\n\n\nPS: Their is no pause button or ingame menu, hold ESC to close the game.","July 4, 2014","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Similar to Super Meat Boy\n- Great soundtrack\n- The minimal graphics really work for the game\n- The concept and design are super abstract which keeps the game really unique\n- Great video style\n\nCons:\n- Difficult at the end (to each his own)\n- Requires headphones for the soundtrack to be sucessful\n- Extremely short maybe 2 hours of gameplay\n- Slightly repetitive\n\nOverall: Excellent indie game that could've been longer. I'm sure some people's reviews would change when that happened. The soundtrack and uniqueness of the game will keep you playing until the end.

I would describe 140 as a rythym platformer.  You are a shape (which changes between circle, square and triangle) and you have to navigate the world and platforms to get these little balls and put them in these pits.  It sounds simple but the cool part is the techno music playing on each level.  The platforms and obstacles in each level move to the different beats in the music.

It's quite the experience to play this game with headphones on or surround sound speakers - atleast it was for me. The game itself consists of 3 levels with 3 additional Shadow levels which can be played after you've finished the regular 3 levels. While the normal 3 levels are filled with checkpoints, the Shadow levels aren't - they're hardcore. If you die, you're out.\n\n140 is a game that heavily relies on its awesome soundtrack.

An original idea, that Jeppe Carlsen (Creator of Limbo as well) worked out in an amazing and unique way, because this is probably the one and only time that this idea will stay unique.\n\nI really enjoyed playing this short but powerful game.

Generally these features come in the form of timed jumps and moving to specific beats given by the background tracks.\n\nI personally found these concepts unique and enjoyable but what let the game down for me was its lack of content. There are only three 10-20 minute levels (six, if you include the inverted levels) and there is a disturbing lack of instructions or information about anything going on when you begin the game (to be fair though the goal is easy to pick up once you get started).\n\nIn terms of story, well... there is none... but the gameplay and audio are the two aspects in which this game shines. You can tell that the musician that produced the upbeat soundtracks and catchy sound effects spent a lot of time perfecting it for the game.\n\nThe controls are quite smooth and handle well, this makes the difficult parts of levels somewhat more tolerable (especially the bosses).\n\nIn terms of replay value, you have the opportunity to play the three original levels again without checkpoints for a real challenge but apart from that there isn't really anything else to do in the game.\n\nI would suggest getting this game if you feel like something different from your average platform game and have a decent hour or two to spare but apart from that I would give it a miss. I feel bad about rating this game negatively but I felt it didn't live up to the expectations I got from reading about the game before I installed it.\n\nRating:\n\nStory = N / A\nGameplay & Controls= 3/5\nGraphics = 3/5\nAudio = 4/5\nReplay Value = 2/5\nDifficulty = 3/5","December 9, 2014","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

People have different tastes, of course, but for lovers of puzzles and those who don't mind a bit--only a bit because this game isn't THAT difficult--of mental workout, 140 is a winner. Screens are simple, colorful--you might even wanna snap a couple of them and use them as wallpapers on your HD LCDs (I did)--and reverberate with pulsating beat music. Game's beat music is the key to way forward, because you will need to time your moves in rhythm with these beats. Puzzles are intelligently crafted and made me laugh in amazement when  I figured them out. There are, in total, three levels, and at the end of each level, you are challenged with a boss screen. The third level, however, has two boss screens, the last one of which is a disappointment since it is solvable with a fixed sequence of key presses however many times you play it. I like this game in particular above many other puzzlers as it doesn't test you on how fast you are at your keyboard, but instead challenges your patience and alertness by offering you unlimited time for each puzzle piece. 9/10.","September 14, 2014","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I could not be less sceptical about this game before I got it but after playing through the game (I play offline so my play time seems short) I can reccomend this game highly. The mechanic of puzzle platforming to the beat of the music seems very gimmicky but its used to great effect. The change in beat and varying puzzle mechanic keeps the game fresh even to its later levels. Some of the puzzles are a bit tricky but what good puzzle platformer doesn't have hard sections to challenge your skills? Pick this game up for a short entertaining time that you will definitely enjoy.","August 22, 2014","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is basically the same as "The Impossible Game", in the sense that it's a aesthetically minimalist platformer in which gameplay is based upon rhythm, although you actually get to control your minimalist avatar.\n\nSo you'll jump your way through 3 levels based on the background music plus 3 bossfights. While the bossfights can be quite challenging, the rest of the game is fairly easy, although I imagine that the 3 additional stages where you have to get through without dying once can be quite challenging depending how well you can deal with rhythm, but I as a musician have no trouble at all.\n\nThe actual levels can be beaten in less than an hour which is just way too short for $5, but since I've bought it at a Humble Bundle sale for $0.33 I can let that slide. Still I feel that for what it is, it could've easily been a free flash game on Newgrounds or Kongregate. It's just so incredibly insubstantial, there's no narrative to engage you with, just raw gameplay that while competently executed in the end becomes somewhat repetitive since there's really no incentive for me to play it again and again. Stuff like FEZ at least had a kind of atmosphere that you can soak in based on its art and music where you can just simply leave it running, look at it and relax, but 140 doesn't offer the same appeal. And the reason I bring up FEZ is because there's actually a quite lengthy part of that game which is also based on timed jumping and rhythm, but it is enhanced by the rest of what the game can offer.\n\nSo in summary, it's one well executed idea that can be beaten in less than an hour for $5. If you feel that justifies the cost then go ahead, but I can say I'm glad I waited for an opportunity to get it cheaper because I would've felt ripped off at its regular price.","August 22, 2014","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The objective is to gather multi-colored orbs and bring them to these half-circle zones nearby. Each orb adds more complexity to both the soundtrack and the level, and opens up more of it. While the controls are pretty simple, some of the platforming does require perfect timing. Platforms move and/or disappear in time with the music, which actually helps, because it allows you to work out the timing required.\n\nAt least in the first three worlds, there's no penalty for death. You simply start back at the last checkpoint. I'm not sure if that continues on. It can be kind of frustrating, since some of the timing does need to be precise, and the boss fights can take a few run throughs to work out the pattern.\n\nI enjoy the music, which is pretty beat-heavy electronica. I do think this is one of those games that would not be kind to anyone with any sort of photosensitivity; the visuals aren't quite neon, but they do tend to change and flash with regularity.","September 19, 2014","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Only reason I decided to play it was because it was at the top of my list of games and was had controller support.\n\nIts a very simple game but I think that worked perfectly well considering how little there is to figure out and how short it is. All you have to do is listen to the music to work in your timing to jump. The music is awesome as well. At the beginning of each level the music starts off simple but as you progress in the level, an extra beat is added and a new feature is implemented that matches the new beat. Over all it made for gameplay smooth and entertaining.","April 29, 2015","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Don't quit the game unless you really want to. Also, there are 6 achievements, the first three are for playing the first three levels, and the last three are for playing the game in reverse. Literally, on the other side of the starting screen is the first three levels to be played again, but mirrored. If the game saved I would play through this another time mirrored, but I won't.

And i was surprised to say the least. Firstly, i LOVE the music, it's Techno/Minimal and you have to use the beat of the music to your advantage, because you need to have precise timing in order to complete the level. The levels interconnect without you noticing it (in terms of loading time), the colors change and the music (don't quote me on the music though).\nI also have to add that I'm not really into Jump'n'Runs or other indie games with that style, but I really enjoyed 104. Sadly, after 1 hour, the game had already ended. I hope they publish an editor of some kind and allowing mods/levels.\nI payed 3,34 €, and for that price I highly recommend it. I'd also recommend it for the full price of 5€, because it's a different experience.

Platforms will appear, grow, shrink, move, blink out of existence, or become deadly to touch at the beat. Walls and hazards will rhythmically turn on and off. It's really very cool. You are an entrepid little monochromatic shape braving the dangers of the three levels and overcoming the bosses at the end of each. If you manage to beat them all, you will be granted an even more challenging adventure (and seriously, the last boss is a huge jerk. Like, really really mean.) I just beat the entire game (and unlocked all achievements, which was nice), and it took me about 6 hours, which is impressive considering if done perfectly, you could probably do the whole game in less than 15 minutes. I think it was worth the money spent.\n\nI love the simplicity of the game's graphics, controls, and objectives, I love the precision and timing involved, and I love the music for this game! The only thing I can think of that I don't like about this game is what happens when you die... I die a lot, and every time it happens I jump out of my chair... If you like heart attacks, seriously pick up this game.\n\nAs a final note, this game is on sale ALL THE TIME. you can either wait and grab it for $1-$3, or support the dev and maybe help them get more games out by paying full price, which I recommend.","September 13, 2014","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

People have different tastes, of course, but for lovers of puzzles and those who don't mind a bit--only a bit because this game isn't THAT difficult--of mental workout, 140 is a winner. Screens are simple, colorful--you might even wanna snap a couple of them and use them as wallpapers on your HD LCDs (I did)--and reverberate with pulsating beat music. Game's beat music is the key to way forward, because you will need to time your moves in rhythm with these beats. Puzzles are intelligently crafted and made me laugh in amazement when  I figured them out. There are, in total, three levels, and at the end of each level, you are challenged with a boss screen. The third level, however, has two boss screens, the last one of which is a disappointment since it is solvable with a fixed sequence of key presses however many times you play it. I like this game in particular above many other puzzlers as it doesn't test you on how fast you are at your keyboard, but instead challenges your patience and alertness by offering you unlimited time for each puzzle piece. 9/10.","September 14, 2014","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I could not be less sceptical about this game before I got it but after playing through the game (I play offline so my play time seems short) I can reccomend this game highly. The mechanic of puzzle platforming to the beat of the music seems very gimmicky but its used to great effect. The change in beat and varying puzzle mechanic keeps the game fresh even to its later levels. Some of the puzzles are a bit tricky but what good puzzle platformer doesn't have hard sections to challenge your skills?

This is basically the same as "The Impossible Game", in the sense that it's a aesthetically minimalist platformer in which gameplay is based upon rhythm, although you actually get to control your minimalist avatar.\n\nSo you'll jump your way through 3 levels based on the background music plus 3 bossfights. While the bossfights can be quite challenging, the rest of the game is fairly easy, although I imagine that the 3 additional stages where you have to get through without dying once can be quite challenging depending how well you can deal with rhythm, but I as a musician have no trouble at all.\n\nThe actual levels can be beaten in less than an hour which is just way too short for $5, but since I've bought it at a Humble Bundle sale for $0.33 I can let that slide. Still I feel that for what it is, it could've easily been a free flash game on Newgrounds or Kongregate. It's just so incredibly insubstantial, there's no narrative to engage you with, just raw gameplay that while competently executed in the end becomes somewhat repetitive since there's really no incentive for me to play it again and again. Stuff like FEZ at least had a kind of atmosphere that you can soak in based on its art and music where you can just simply leave it running, look at it and relax, but 140 doesn't offer the same appeal. And the reason I bring up FEZ is because there's actually a quite lengthy part of that game which is also based on timed jumping and rhythm, but it is enhanced by the rest of what the game can offer.\n\nSo in summary, it's one well executed idea that can be beaten in less than an hour for $5. If you feel that justifies the cost then go ahead, but I can say I'm glad I waited for an opportunity to get it cheaper because I would've felt ripped off at its regular price.","August 22, 2014","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Honestly the closest I think I've ever played to a true rhythm platformer and that's what makes it so strong; the rhythm elements are well-implemented and the level designs use them effectively without ever unfairly. The game's honestly not too difficult to clear normally, though the reverse stages certainly present a bit more of a challenge. The bosses also tend to break the mold of the game, though they're not too challenging once you figure out strategies for them. The minimal graphic style I'm neutral on; doesn't detract from the game but doesn't add to it either, it's just there and I'm fine with that.\n\nOverall though, a neat little game that I'm glad I played.","July 25, 2014","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you like electronic music and music/rhythm games, this is for you! In short, 140 managed to provide me one of the most immersive and memorable experiences I ever had in gaming. Let me settle down and tell you about it.\n\n140 is a minimalistic and abstract platformer rhythm game. There are no lives, menus, tutorials or hand-holding: it's just left, right and jump. The levels are composed of platforms and blocks/obstacles with different properties that respond to the "periodic nature" of the music/rhythm, comprising of minimal dubstep with a subtle hint of chiptunes. (At places, it reminded me of Krafwerk). Listening to the music/rhythm is essential to figure out how the obstacles work, enabling you progress. This discovery involves some trial and error, also because the game is a bit challenging, but there are frequent seamless checkpoints that almost immediately respawn you when you fail. As you progress along each level the music and rhythm patterns become more complex, making for more complex obstacle sequences, which creates a sense of momentum and exhilaration as you successfuly understand and manage to execute how to get past an obstacle. At the end of each of the 3 groups of levels, there is a "boss", which is more challenging but also spectacular and rewarding.\n\nThe overall design of this game is nothing short of brilliant: the music and visuals/blocks are synergistically woven together; the platforming elements and obstacles nail the sweet spot between recognizability and making you pause a moment to observe and think; the flow and pacing are perfect and the aesthetic, both in visuals and music is the definition of minimal beauty. Because everything revolves around the rhythm of the music, the game subtly demands that you get into it and "feel" the rhythm, which in turn gradually makes the experience more and more immersive as you "attune" yourself to it. Looking back on this, I think it's truly a remarkable feat of game design. Managing to beat the final "boss" was immensely rewarding: it made me feel like it was an epic end to a most amazing adventure. Digital bliss.\n\nBecause "dying" hurts the flow of the music, I felt the game instilling me a desire to play without errors on further playthroughs, and mastering this game and being able to finish it in one go withouth dying would be a truly special achievement. You could try just that: after finishing the game you unlock a special mode where you can start from the beginning with the levels mirrored horizontally and, if you die, you start from the beginning...\n\nThere are only two minor concerns worthy of note. Firstly, the game is somewhat short (it took me about 1h to complete? in one sitting) and left me wanting more. Secondly, the final "boss" is quite difficult and I suspect will frustrate some people because it involves not only realising the pattern but also using very fast eye-hand reactions.\n\nHowever, there is something very special about this game, so minimal and yet so complete.","July 5, 2014","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Each time you complete a segment you save at a checkmark, which makes it less painful when you fail over and over again. Some people may struggle with the timing or precise controls required to complete some of the challenges, but I wouldn't call any of them impossible.\n\nMost objects on the screen, besides your character, are simple squares. It doesn't get much simpler than that, but somehow it works. The graphics are vibrant and trippy at times, moving and changing colors to match the electronic music. The music by the way is fantastic! As you complete chapters and other key parts of the game the music will shift to reward the player with some awesome sounds.\n\nMy only complaint is that the game took me less than 90 minutes to complete. When you complete the 3 main acts (which takes 1-2 hours),you unlock the same 3 acts, but in reverse and without checkpoints. This should provide me some extra play time, but I'm certain that I will get frustrated and give up without the checkpoint handicap. So for that reason, the game doesn't have much replay value and the campaign is short, so I would only recommend this game if you find it on sale for $1-2.","July 15, 2014","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

On one hand, the various challenges and gorgeous visuals all tied into the beat of each level is implemented perfectly, offering a blissful yet difficult platforming experience that will leave a nice impression. On the other, even with the 5 dollar price tag, paying that much is a stretch for the little content provided. Consisting of only 3 levels, each about 5-10 minutes in length, 140 is stretched out through its increasing difficulty and bosses, which can last multiple times longer than the levels themselves, even with generous checkpoints.\n\nThe game shines brightest in the platforming sections, implementing the mechanics I've mentioned before and having a smooth difficulty curve that is never unfair, as you always know when it's your mistake. The first two bosses as well are decently balanced and don't take long to adapt and beat, even after a few tries, but it is the third and final boss that felt more of an excercise of frustration than any sort of challenge.\nThere is a method to the third boss' madness, but you have to adapt to a lot of variables to beat this one, even after you finally wrap your head around the constantly changing mechanics after every checkpoint.\n\nBeating this boss provides no payoff either, as there is no new content following, nor a nod to your accomplishment outside of the standard steam achievement. You do unlock mirrored versions of all three levels, which could be fun if they didn't turn off checkpoints. Getting all the way to a boss only to die and lose all your progress and gain elevated blood pressure is not my idea of fun. If you're excessively masochistic and want to have an awful day, go for those challenge levels, but otherwise 140 is a nice surprise that has some nice shining moments, even if it never lives up to its potential.\n\n","November 20, 2014","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Shortness of a game is sometimes very relative and this is one of those times. When you have a game, that offers entertainment on this level all the way, you really can't put the concept of "how long it takes to beat it" on a high pedestal. Quality over quantity.

Not as unforgiving as Super Hexagon as I've seen others compare it to. A disadvantage is that there's no soundtrack included/released, as this very much a core reason why it's great, if you're into lofiish electronic music. It's VERY short though, only has taken me about an hour to complete all the 3 regular levels and one of the bonus stages. It will probably be more challenging if you have less experience with music games, platformers and following a rhythm, since I also mastered Bit Trip Runner, but I don't think it will take you that much longer to get as far as me.

Instead of rushing through (which will certainly result in several deaths), most sections of all the levels almost REQUIRE you to pause and wait for the path to become clear. In some ways this is enjoyable, as it emphasizes the mental reasoning over twitch reflexes, but it can also come across like driving down a highway and hitting every light red; even if there is absolutely no rush, it gets frustrating.\n\nEverything in the game is responsive to different track sections that the player activates to progress through the game, but the caveat to this is that while the level is perfectly in time with the music, this actually requires the character to move OUT of sync with that same music. Instead of jamming to the beat, you're really jamming in counterpoint, almost like you are actually fighting against the track. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but for those who have grown up on or mastered DDR, Guitar Hero, Elite Beat Agents, or even games like Audiosurf or the Bit Trip series, will find themselves getting a number of annoying flase starts when they try to move to the music and match it's timing.\n\nThe controls are smooth, and incredibly simple. This could easily translate to a smartphone, using the gyroscope for movement and a single button press to jump, or the bottom half of the screen split for left and right movement, with the entire top half of the screen as a big jump button that the thumb for the inactive direction can press.\n\nIt only has 3 levels, which are then recycled into mirror levels that strip out all the checkpoints for extra challenge. There are "Boss battles" and I really enjoyed the first and second battles for these, but the final boss battle made the mistake of increasing its challenge by making it the player's ability to control their avatar more difficult, instead of making the boss smarter, tougher, or less predictable.\n\nDue to the small size, lack of opportunity for quirky/creative acheivements (all the current steam list that are merely "beat X level" even the hidden ones) that would add to replay value, I wouldn't really recommend paying more than $2 - $3 for it, preferrably on something like a humble bundle sale that would let you get it for multiple platforms. All the same, I DO recommend it.\n\nWhat this game really needs is a mixer level, that would let the player gather together and manually activate all of the different track section they had been able to aquire. This would easily add $2 to the total I'd be willing to recomend.","May 26, 2014","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you like electronic music and music/rhythm games, this is for you! In short, 140 managed to provide me one of the most immersive and memorable experiences I ever had in gaming. Let me settle down and tell you about it.\n\n140 is a minimalistic and abstract platformer rhythm game. There are no lives, menus, tutorials or hand-holding: it's just left, right and jump. The levels are composed of platforms and blocks/obstacles with different properties that respond to the "periodic nature" of the music/rhythm, comprising of minimal dubstep with a subtle hint of chiptunes. (At places, it reminded me of Krafwerk). Listening to the music/rhythm is essential to figure out how the obstacles work, enabling you progress. This discovery involves some trial and error, also because the game is a bit challenging, but there are frequent seamless checkpoints that almost immediately respawn you when you fail. As you progress along each level the music and rhythm patterns become more complex, making for more complex obstacle sequences, which creates a sense of momentum and exhilaration as you successfuly understand and manage to execute how to get past an obstacle. At the end of each of the 3 groups of levels, there is a "boss", which is more challenging but also spectacular and rewarding.\n\nThe overall design of this game is nothing short of brilliant: the music and visuals/blocks are synergistically woven together; the platforming elements and obstacles nail the sweet spot between recognizability and making you pause a moment to observe and think; the flow and pacing are perfect and the aesthetic, both in visuals and music is the definition of minimal beauty. Because everything revolves around the rhythm of the music, the game subtly demands that you get into it and "feel" the rhythm, which in turn gradually makes the experience more and more immersive as you "attune" yourself to it. Looking back on this, I think it's truly a remarkable feat of game design. Managing to beat the final "boss" was immensely rewarding: it made me feel like it was an epic end to a most amazing adventure. Digital bliss.\n\nBecause "dying" hurts the flow of the music, I felt the game instilling me a desire to play without errors on further playthroughs, and mastering this game and being able to finish it in one go withouth dying would be a truly special achievement. You could try just that: after finishing the game you unlock a special mode where you can start from the beginning with the levels mirrored horizontally and, if you die, you start from the beginning...\n\nThere are only two minor concerns worthy of note. Firstly, the game is somewhat short (it took me about 1h to complete? in one sitting) and left me wanting more. Secondly, the final "boss" is quite difficult and I suspect will frustrate some people because it involves not only realising the pattern but also using very fast eye-hand reactions.\n\nHowever, there is something very special about this game, so minimal and yet so complete.","July 5, 2014","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I bought it a long time ago on humble when it was on sale. It took me like an hour and half to complete. It has primarily 3 levels. To complete each level, you have to pass a series of smaller obstacle avoiding courses and capture a ball-thingy and take it back to the capture point (think of it like Capture the Flag mode, where you have to capture and take the flag to a capture point, except in this case, the flag is a ball).  The game primarily relies on following rhythm to jump and/or avoid obstacles. The soundtrack is pretty awesome, I wish I could get it outside the game. All the puzzles have rhythm which once you get a hang of is a breeze to complete. Fortunately, the game does not end there. With in each level, the rhythm and obstacles change often enought to give you some challenge.\nIn all there are actually 6 levels, (3 main, 3 repeated excepted tougher levels). The difference is that the three main levels have checkpoints spanned over levels to give you a chance to resume if you screwed up. The 3 repeated levels do not have checkpoints so you have to finish them without making a mistake or you will have to start over. As I said, the 3 main levels took me like an hour and a half tops, so its a very short game in that sense.\nAlso warning, this game has colours flashing like crazy so if you are prone to having seizures or headaches, I would recommend avoiding this game. I had occasions where my head would suddenly hurt from all the bright colours flashing on screen.\nAll in all, its a decent pick if you get it on sale. Its definitely worth the hour or two you spend on it.","November 28, 2015","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game has a very interesting premise, but the execution is poor. The result is infuriating and tedious trial and error that saps all life from the game. Consequently, it isn't nearly as fun or interesting as the trailer makes it out to be; and though the music is good, even *that's* not as fun or interesting as the trailer makes it out to be. This game *very* quickly becomes a chore; every so often I forget how unenjoyable it is, and launch it. I rarely play for more than five minutes before I remember why I don't like this game. Which is a shame, because I really wanted to like it.\n\nThe game is also too short and minimalistic for me to condone the price. The three sudden death "mirror levels" you can access after completing the three basic levels make it longer, but they're too boring, repetitive, and frustrating to really matter.","November 21, 2015","false","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's got a VERY forgiving autosave system with infinite lives, so you won't get overly frustrated if you happen to hit a spot where you get killed a lot.  If you have any experience with platform gaming at all, you should breeze through the majority of the game, including most of the level bosses.  I personally found the end boss a bit annoying since the pattern shifts were making my head implode, but it was still good fun.  Worth a buy for the music in the game at the least.  Since it's got a really short play time from start to end (30-60 minutes) even when you count failing on the end boss multiple times, I'd wait for a sale to grab it.","December 31, 2013","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Think about precision platformer, with moving elements synced with the background music beat. Think about an entire game exploring this concept.\n\nEach new challenge shows up only once or twice, so the game never feels repetitive. The developer chose to make a short game (about 1 hour) instead of artificially increasing its length by repeating the same things over and over, which is a great decision in my opinion.\n\nFor hardcore gamers, there are also achievements for completing each stage without dying.","December 31, 2013","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's polished, innovative, clever and it leaves you feeling satisfied with the experience. It consists of three levels of rhythm based platforming that increase in difficulty with a "boss" at the end of each level. This is what took me around 45 minutes to play and was very well paced. After you complete that half of the game you unlock a second half which is a modified version of the first half but with everything mirrored and with no checkpoints so you have to start from the beginning if you make a mistake. This hardcore mode is a nice addition for people who enjoy the game and want to perfect their own gameplay vs. this small but perfect game.","December 27, 2013","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As you navigate your polyhedron through the stark landscape, the obstacles shift in time to the music, and often contribute to the building soundtrack. It's hard to explain how well this all comes together to pull you into a trance while you try to jump and dodge traps, pits, and moving blocks. The boss fights really step up the game, and put a spin on the fundamentals learned through each of the game's 3 levels.\n\nWhile 140 runs a bit on the short side, it more than makes up for it with style, clean and engaging gameplay, and a brilliant music-game interaction. Absolutely worth a few bucks if you like any of the words above.","January 1, 2014","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
