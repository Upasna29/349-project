This makes the original Windows game look like a joke. The number of strategies you need to use to solve the puzzles is incredible and gives the game far more depth than Minesweeper. The only reason I wouldn't recommend this game is if you could not beat the original Hexcells. The puzzles here are brutally difficult, much harder than the original, and some may take you hours to figure out. If you're up for a challenge, you'll find that this game truly hexcells.","July 6, 2015","true","12.0"," 40 of 42 people (95%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","95","40","42","10","0"

In fact, I played it three or four times over!]\n\nHexcells Plus is everything I am always looking for in a puzzle game, distilled to a deceptively simple interface. Though comparisons to Minesweeper are not unwarranted, these comparisons miss a crucial difference: in Minesweeper, the final moves often (and annoyingly) come down to chance, debasing all the carefully planned moves you'd made before should you--at the end of a long game--happen to click a mine.\n\nIn Hexcells (and Hexcells Plus), however, the game gives you JUST enough information to never, ever have to guess. But you will often spend many, many minutes searching for and debating your next move. While the game provides various clues as to where you can find Hexes and numbers, it does not (at least past the first few levels) make this obvious (as it is in a game like Picross, for example, where every column's number of squares is provided). It only provides clues for a limited number of columns, rows, sections, etc.; based on this, and based on tricks you'll pick up and teach yourself as you go along, you'll have to very carefully make your next move.\n\nAnd this is the crucial difference: any mistake you make in Hexcells is your own fault--thus Hexcells corrects an unfortunate norm in the puzzle genre. So, between chess-like demands on your every move, between the security of knowing the game will not force you to guess, between the pleasing visuals and soothing ambient soundtrack, Hexcells Plus is one of, if not THE, best puzzle games I have ever played, and I play many.\n\n5/5","February 19, 2014","true","1.9"," 39 of 43 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","39","43","0","0"

If you thought the first game was too easy (and let's face it, that surely includes everyone) then this is the real game right here. The first Hexcells only gets interesting in the last few levels; well, Hexcells Plus starts off from that point, so it's logically a much better game. The concept is simple: find which cells are occupied and which are empty using surrounding clues that tell you how many occupied cells are in a row, how many occupied cells are adjacent to each occupied cell, and how many occupied cells are found within a certain radius of an occupied cell. It looks like Minesweeper at first glance, but it's far more interesting than that. Some of the later levels here get pretty tough, and there are times when you find it difficult to believe that it's possible without guessing, but then suddenly you'll spot a line of reasoning that you've missed and a few more pieces of the puzzle fall into place.

You had to find the mines and avoid them by marking them. It worked with some clues, since numbers gave away how many mines are close by.\n\nThe Hexcells games are very similar to it, but they are not working in square blocks, they come in hexagon shape and often remind of chemical combinations when you open the next level. These shapes make it sometimes hard to figure out what is going on and in later levels you get extra clues for the lines of hexagons and stuff like that.\n\nplaying Hexcells is fun in a kind of weird way. Even if you don't want to make your math homework, you sit down to "calculate" the grids, but it is not that much math anyway, more like drawing lines from dot to dot.\n\nLater versions of Hexcells (Hexcells Plus & Hexcells Ininite) are basically the same thing on harder levels and Infinite includes an Endless-Mode that let's you play levels created by chance. Start with the normal game and get infected, this game is addictive and you should consider buying the complete pack right from start.\n\n\n10/10 I think I've seen more hexagons than a beekeeper did\n","May 28, 2015","true","7.0"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

Also, it does feel irritating if you make a mistake towards the end of a level after having spent 20 minutes on it, especially if you're after the Perfectionist achievement without cheating.\n\nAnyway, the puzzles are hand-made and some actually almost made me laugh out loud when they revealed some perfectly composed, might I say beautiful, hint as to how the blue hexes are set.

At the time of writing that review, I was unprepared to spend another few dollars on Hexcells Plus. One day Hexcells Plus was on sale, and I figured I should give it a shot, and I'm glad I did.\n\nThis game is certainly an improvement on the first one and I enjoyed it a lot. The puzzles are a bit harder and some present an actual challenge, particularly if you are disciplined and refuse to let yourself make a blind guess.\n\nGameplayThe concept of this game is intriguing, adding a few levels of complication and being much more accurate in the solution than Minesweeper is. No guesses are required, everything can be figured out with logic and enough persistence. Harness your inner vulcan!\n\nSome of those complications I mentioned include: cells are hexagons, there are more numbers (rather than just being on the cells they are also found on columns and rows), there are different sorts of numbers (some mean that a string of "mines" are all adjacent, others that "mine" strings are interrupted by a gap).\n\nControlsVery simple - right click and left click. Still no option in game to change which button does what, but you can change it at game launch. However, by now I've become mostly accustomed to them and didn't make too many stupid mistakes by hitting the wrong button.\n\nStorylineNo storyline, doesn't need one.\n\nSoundRelaxing gentle zen echoie noises. Also, when you click a cell you get nice tinkling chime-like noises. I don't know why that makes it more satisfying to click on cells, but it does!\n\nGraphicsVery crisp, clean, and clear. The numbers are reasonably large. Some puzzles form an interesting overall image or pattern, and overall, the puzzles come across as well designed.\n\nPros+ crisp clean graphics whose job is to be functional\n+ simple controls to grasp\n+ more interesting concept than random old Minesweeper\n+ improvements over the first game\nCons- still a fairly short game\n- the option to switch the mouse button actions is outside the game\n\nHelp Me Help YouIf you did not find this review helpful, I would really appreciate your constructive criticism - tell me why it wasn’t helpful for you.

While Plus technically has the same exact number of puzzles, it will last you a whole lot longer--there are new mechanics that make the game far, far more challenging than the first. The same basic gameplay is still here: it's kind of a mashup of Minesweeper and Picross, and it's incredibly satisfying to logically work out all the solutions.\n\nIf you played the first game, there's two new types of tiles. Black hexes can have a question mark on them; they serve to severely limit the paths one can take to fully solve the board. These end up being an effective way to resolve the primary issue with the game's structure, in that it is otherwise far, far too easy to finish puzzles. The second new mechanic is blue tiles with numbers--the number represents how many blue hexes are present within a two-tile radius. They're great additions; I found them to be a pretty clever way to expand the basic structure of the game.\n\nIt's absolutely wonderful to have a sequel that provides more of what I enjoyed while also resolving every issue I had with  the initial entry in the series. The first Hexcells honestly just feels like a prototype after playing Plus; I'd still recommend it, but there's no reason whatsoever to play it if you've skipped to Plus.

While the latter is true (if you like the game), the first part isn't; Hexcells Plus is frustratingly difficult.\nI'll argue that the game mechanics have changed, and it's straight up not as fun as the first game.\n\nLike in chess, you have to be able to think a couple of steps ahead, but if you're unable to do that to a sufficient degree, all hope is lost. If you've played (Microsoft) Minesweeper on 'Advanced', you'll know the feeling of having to guess at least once per game. In Hexcells you'll be guessing a lot and that is frustrating as hell.\nThe game does give you some leeway in regards to the number of mistakes you can make, but while I could make it to the end of Hexcells in about 2 hours, and achieve a perfect score with some determination, I have given up on making it further than the 5th 'World' in Hexcells Plus. There is no difficulty setting, nor a hint system.\n\nIf there is some sort of system to solving the game (other than what is taught in the first few levels), I certainly haven't been able to figure it out, and the game hasn't led me in the right direction.\n\n(Edit: To clarify; the puzzles are 100% solveable by logic and time spent (unlike Minesweeper), but you'll be guessing a lot if you find the game difficult, as I did. This was an unexpected change from the first game, which I found to have a reasonable and enjoyable difficulty level.

This game was pretty fun. The puzzles are pretty neat, with math and logic being the primary factors. For me, it was a fairly relaxing way to spend an evening.

Because of this, you are really needing to memorize the patterns since the occasional question mark instead of a numeric hint throws math and logic out the window.\n\nSo...what I did was finish each puzzle and unlock enough points to progress to the next set on y own, until I was able to finish the game (which took me around an hour and a half or so, then went back today with a guide and got each one perfect for the final achievement.\n\nI would have given this game about an 8.5 out of 10, but the cheap moments sort of work to nullify actual logic and math thus defeating the actual purpose of the game, and so I knock this down to a 6 out of 10. Still a good game, but the random moments force you to rely solely on memorizing the puzzles that have the question marks (this will make more sense when you play it by the way) rather than the intended math and logic. Had they left that randomness out though, this would have been a near perfect puzzle game. Still, I recommend it.

The developer definitely put in a ton of effort making these puzzles - there's always times where you'll get completely stumped for a few minutes, then suddenly notice something you didn't earlier! The game is extremely addicting; I kept getting an urge to play the next puzzle immediately after finishing one!\n\nThe game does have its flaws, though. There's a special blue numbered cell that creates a highlighted area when clicked on, but that area is white on a white background, which led to me making mistakes more than just a few times. That really ruins your current puzzle, because getting more than 2 mistakes makes you lose your perfect puzzle status, which I went for!\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend this to anyone who even remotely likes puzzles and Minesweeper - it's an extremely unique game with calming music and an ambient atmosphere! :)\n\nOh, and check out Rock Paper Shotgun's review if you haven't yet!","June 22, 2014","true","7.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I mean, I get that the puzzles don't require you to guess. That much has been pounded into my head thirty times per discussion board thread. And it's been proven to me to a degree that I accept. Okay. The puzzles don't require you to guess.\n\n...who cares? They're not fun.\n\nI think that the main reason I don't like these puzzles is because if I'm stuck, there's nothing I can really try. What I mean is that the puzzles are completely binary - every space only has two possible choices. So if I'm stuck and I decide that I want to make a guess, I can either guess left click or right click, and my guess is either correct, in which case I know the answer, or it's incorrect... in which case I know the answer. There's no exploration of the puzzle. If I'm stuck in this game and don't want to automatically give myself the answer to the part of the puzzle I'm working on, my only option is to literally just stare at the screen.\n\nLink-A-Pix is a good example of an interesting puzzle because while it only has a single solution, it allows me to try many things without giving parts of the puzzle away to me for trying them. If I'm stuck, I don't have to just stare at the screen - I can try to connect the 9s in one place a different way to make room for something else, or I can pick a different 9 to connect to altogether, or I can even completely erase a small section and redo it to see if it makes room for something I haven't connected yet. Link-A-Pix is not at all binary - when I'm stuck, I can actively search for the solution to a single piece of the puzzle without it being handed to me if that guess is wrong.\n\nOf course, Sudoku is another great (and probably way more popular) example. How many of you guys have come to the end of a Sudoku board and realized "Oh crap, something's wrong here"? That's because Sudoku cleverly gives you options and ways to mess up without giving the answer away if you do mess up. Can you imagine if putting a number in the wrong place revealed to you the right number to put in that place? It would be silly because you wouldn't be able to try anything without parts of the puzzle being handed to you every time you make a mistake. And yet, it also only has one solution, and can even be solved without ever guessing.\n\nWith Hexcells, I can't very actively try anything - I can sit and stare at the same material until one little piece jumps out at me, and then I can sit and stare at the same material some more. Spending hours just staring at the same obscure clues over and over again... is just not fun. I don't find the puzzles to be engaging.\n\nI really don't care if you disagree with me. I'm not saying the game was poorly made - like you've all said a million times, the game has logical solutions that do not require you to guess. Okay. I still don't think it's fun. And who seriously recommends a game on Steam that they don't think is fun? I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to pretend that reviewing games is an objective process. No amount of fact can make me like Hexcells, or recommend it to someone. I just simply can't do either one.\n\nSo, I guess I'm the lone negative review. UPDATE: Yay, a couple people agree with me, I'm not alone anymore.","June 4, 2014","false","1.5"," 21 of 38 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","21","38","0","0"

At least, if you're still interested after the first one, which won't take you long to get through.\n\nThey're both magnificent.\n\nHexcells is often compared to Minesweeper and that's quite apt (also, Sudoku), but where Minesweeper usually devolves into frustrating guesswork, the puzzles in Hexcells are finely crafted individual pieces that (as far as I can tell) always contain just enough information to solve. So often, when the combination of elements that unlocked some part of the puzzle finally revealed itself to me, I would not just feel the wave of satisfaction at my own accomplishment, but would find myself nodding in appreciation, seeing how carefully that whole side of the board was put together.\n\nAnd despite Hexcells Plus containing some incredibly tough puzzles (I have one level left to do at the time of writing), perhaps the aspect most worthy of raving about is that they're both such calming games. The gorgeous ambient soundtrack is...gorgeous, and the developer has enough respect for his puzzles to not add some forced layer of pressure like a time limit. The pace is then whatever you need it to be - for me, the harder puzzles in Hexcells Plus were often a "leave it on all day, have another look at it in half an hour" pace - and I love that.\n\nTaken together (and they should be, because Hexcells is almost just an introduction to Hexcells Plus), these form a really marvelous little game.","February 20, 2014","true","2.9"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

I took around 8-9 hours to complete the game, and it's been a long time since I've felt the same level of satisfaction that I did when I finally beat the game.\n\nThis is an excellent, excellent puzzle game and I cannot recommend it enough. Those familiar with Minesweeper or logical principles can probably feel free to jump in here without having played Hexcells., Those less familiar may want to look into Hexcells first, but keep in mind it's effectively "easy/intro" mode - it'll probably take around 1/10th the time to complete.","July 25, 2014","true","8.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This can be both a good and a bad thing. Because of the higher challenge level, I strongly recommend you to first play the original Hexcells.\n\nGame has changed little from the original Hexcells. User interface (UI) is exactly the same as before. Just like in Hexcells, you have to deduce whether hexes are blue or black based on simple rules similar to Hanjies and Mine Sweeper. However, the puzzles are completely new. The sequel adds one new mechanic: now blue cells can also have a number on them that dictates how many hexes in two cells' radius are blue. Still no guessing is required at all: everything can be logically deduced.\n\nMusic has changed a bit but it retains the ambient theme from the original.\n\nJust like in Hexcells, there are 36 well-designed, challenging puzzles. Unlike Hexcells, the challenge level jumps up very quickly, and the further you get, the longer the puzzles will take to complete (assuming you are not guessing and strive for perfection). Coming straight from Hexcells it's alright but starting out it would be a bit too much. Especially the new mechanic of numbered blue cells can make it difficult to understand what's going on, though the UI has a convenient helping function to keep your thoughts straight. Unfortunately at least I had to resort to the infamous "try and exclude" deduction strategy way more often in this sequel than in the original game, so the puzzles can drag a lot longer. The lack of saving option within puzzles can become a drag if you find yourself in a hurry.\n\nI still recommend Hexcells Plus to anyone who liked the original Hexcells and was left craving for more. The upped difficulty level is more hardcore though and I can't emphasize this quality too much. For me the game took some 10 hours to complete fully, while original Hexcells was just a 2-hour stroll. If you want a smoother difficulty curve and a more pleasant a sequel considering the difficulty level, you should skip straight to Hexcells Infinite that also finally adds saves and random levels.\n\nIn that effect Hexcells Plus shares many problems of its predecessor: it has limited content that lacks replayability after being completed and saving feature before that. However, it also shares most of its virtues: well-designed, albeit (perhaps) too challenging puzzles (when compared to the original one) with pretty much perfect user interface and audiovisual outlook for its game type. For challenge's sake it continues from where Hexcells was left so in that effect it is also a fine sequel for the puzzle enthusiast.","May 28, 2015","true","10.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I almost never use walkthroughs for these types of games, but one puzzle had me stumped for so long that I had to resort to it once.\n\nThe puzzles themself are brilliantly designed, and it's clear that the developer put a large amount of time into making sure they were of the highest quality.  The ambient music in the background is wonderful and calming; it also adds to the wonderful experience this game provides.

The board starts with an oddly shaped field made of orange hexagons. Mines are marked by left-clicking a hexagon, turning it blue. Hexagons are revealed by right-clicking, showing the number underneath if you click correctly and shaking the piece and adding a tally mark to your mistake count if you're too hasty in your decisions.\n\nUnlike the original Minesweeper, Hexcells is a much more complex game involving a board marked with various different types of clues that give the player hints about how many mines are in each column or in the surrounding area of the board. Hexcells Plus expands upon the original Hexcells by giving players an additional thirty-six puzzles to complete with a couple of added gameplay elements. These elements include the dreaded ?, a marking that denotes a hexagon that has an unrevealed amount of mines around it, as well as numbered mines that indicate how many mines are in a two-piece radius surrounding the hexagon.\n\nUnfortunately, the addition of ? hexagons adds a somewhat frustrating element to an otherwise well-balanced game. I often found myself encountering large walls of ?'s that split the board in half, preventing me from continuing on without making a few risky clicks based off some logical guesswork. Altogether, I found Hexcells Plus to be fun, but slightly less enjoyable and more frustration-inducing than the original Hexcells (although that, perhaps, might have been caused in part by the ridiculously long span of time I had been playing Hexcells for by the time I reached some of Hexcells Plus's more challenging levels).\n\nNonetheless, Hexcells Plus is an engrossing way to spend an afternoon. Hexcells Plus can be seen as an expansion to the original Hexcells, adding thirty-six new levels for players to complete, or it can be played as a standalone experience, with the basics of the original Hexcells being explained in the earliest levels of Hexcells Plus. After completing the set of levels contained in Hexcells Plus, be sure to check out the original Hexcells or the inexhaustible Hexcells Infinite, which includes a rather effective level generator and the ability to play user-generated content.","January 1, 2015","true","13.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Remember how fun it was finding those hidden mines, and how you could feel your brain scream "NOOOOOOOOOOO" whenever a mine would pop its stupid head up and kill you? Remember how immensely frustrating it was when it was entirely impossible to solve levels without guessing?\n\nWELL, NO MORE! Hexcells to the rescue.\n\nHexcells is very similar to Minesweeper in that you have to use various clues and reasoning to find the hidden blue cells on each level, but unlike Minesweeper, Hexcells' soultions can ALWAYS be reasoned, and if you're doing it right you will never have to guess.\n\nThe levels start out easy, with simple rules and puzzles, but new tricks are added just regularly enough to fully grasp, and before you know it, you'll find yourself scanning through 15 different criteria to find the 1-in-100 blue cell to start a level off. It's very satisfying.\n\nSpeaking of satisfying, the puzzles here never seem overwhelming or too tricky. Take my opinion with a grain of salt (since I have always loved games like this), but the level of difficulty in these puzzles was just perfect, and while some levels did force me to stare at them for a while, the solution was always there somewhere just waiting for me to grab it.\n\nThe Hexcells series is really 3 games: Hexcells, Hexcells Plus, and Hexcells Infinite. They each have different puzzles, and they are each worth getting, but Hexcells Infinite is the one to get if you're on a budget. It has the most advanced puzzles, and it includes a random level generator, so you can literally play to your heart's content. All 3 of them will slowly progress you through the mechanics of the game, though, so don't feel like you will be overwhelmed if you jump right into Infinite.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that the random levels in Infinite are mere pale shadows compared to the premade levels (they are often quite easy), but for fans that cannot get enough and don't want to go back to the guess-fest Minesweeper, they can be a lot of fun.\n\nI highly recommend this game. If you're a fan of logic-based puzzle games, you can't go wrong with any of these 3 games. The prices are cheap, and the series is rather unique. If the devs could have just tightened up the infinite level generator ever-so-slightly, this game might be the only game I've rated to pass Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons.\n\nScratch that Minesweeper itch, my friend!","January 21, 2015","true","0.6"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Minesweeper fit to a hex grid with some additional clues/rules is how this game plays. The basic numbers reveal how many surrounding areas need to be marked, just like Minesweeper. There are also clues for total number along a line of the grid, and the blue hexes tell how many are to be marked within two hexes away. Clues can be clicked to highlight the region they apply to. Around a number, curly braces mean that number is touching/contiguous, while hyphens mean they are not. Throw in only one ambient track, and that is the game. It consists of 36 puzzles which took me 16 hours to "perfect," which seemingly allows one mistake.\n\nIt's good this is the case, as the clicking is opposite that of Minesweeper. It can be changed, but I say stick with default for consistency of marking lines and blue hexes, which cannot be changed. Also, when a puzzle is solved, the results screen instantly comes up to cover the puzzle, which limits solving-satisfaction. The game can save three profiles, and for a given Steam Achievement to register the game must be restarted and your profile reloaded.","May 13, 2014","true","16.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A minesweeper style puzzle game, which has hexes and 36 levels of non-randomized logical puzzles.\n\nit isn't revolution of some sorts. It's just "more of puzzles". Same logical "there is always a way". Still have to figure out a path to victory based on all info that hexes give you as you clean the field. Still same ambient soundtrack and graphics. Just 36 more levels?\n\nWell, here is a catch: it's not 80% tutorial, unlike Hexcells. It still introduces elements, for new players, but does it quickly, and then sends you to figure out the challenging puzzles, varied and with "aha!" moments. THE real game of Hexcells.\nOh, and it introduce one new element, where some blue (mines) hexes show the amount of other blue hexes in a big radius, as a number. Yay, not just new levels.\n\nOh. And new players, do try not to just cheat and get the map of the non-randomized puzzles by just clicking on everything and then replaying level perfectly. It's more fun to figure it out by yourself in a honest way, restarting as soon as made a mistake.\n\nSo yes, definitely pick this Hexcells Plus, possibly skipping the Hexcells, if you don't want to get whole bundle! It really is the meat. Though, Hexcells Infinite, the last in trilogy, is as good too, check that one out.","January 13, 2015","true","21.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

As the other reviews will tell you it's a mix of Minesweeper and Picross played on a Hex grid instead of a square one. And that's just the start of it, with additional rules introduced slowly that will definitely keep you challenged.\n\nThis is the first Hexcells game I've played, even tough it's the second one in the series, because of this the puzzles might have grown harder a bit faster than you might be used to in a game (I know I had to get used to it). I assume Hexcells introduced the basics at a more leisurely pace, however Plus also starts with these basics and assumes no prior knowledge of how to solve these puzzles.\n\nAll in all there are 36 puzzles, which range from "engaging" to "fiendishly hard". Later levels are unlocked by playing earlier levels and doing well on them (rated on number of mistakes made, there is no timed element).\nThere are some points where I feel the game could have improved, primarily a mid-level save functionality and the ability to mark black cells as done (or have this done automatically), but these are small issues that do not detract from the entertainment.\n\nA solid game that I recommend to anybody looking for a puzzle game that doesn't follow the same tired concepts.","October 5, 2014","true","20.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's a bit like minesweeper but without the frustration of logically impossible puzzles, and it's honestly much more fun and interesting.  It's simple to understand the basic rules/tricks but levels can definitely be tricky. Luckily there is always a logical next step based on the clues you get such as "there is 2 blues touching this hexagon" or "there are 3 blues in this column and they are all touching each other". The clues get more subtle as you go on, and by the end you need to combine multiple clues and always be considering what clues have now become relevant with your latest move.There's not a huge amount of puzzles, but the quality of them is good and the solutions/levels are nicely varied.  It's already a low price and in the sale it usually drops by a good margin, so it's definitely value for money whenever you decide to pick it up.\n\nAside from new puzzles, there's also a few new clue types compared to the first Hexcells game, if you liked the first you will like this too.","October 17, 2014","true","21.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

While the original was a fun, challenging, and relaxing puzzle game, Hexcells Plus throws that away in favor of making it frustratingly difficult. The introduction of new mechanics was a good idea, but so miserably executed that it sucked out every bit of fun that the original had. Most of the "puzzles" near the end were just guessing.\n\nIt comes with the same amount of content as the original for the same price, but totally isn't worth it.

Needless to say, it takes a lot more brain power for this game than the previous one.\n\nI am not going to remove my old review because, let's face it, first impressions are everything in a game. My first impression was that this game was horrid and had lost it's original appeal with the removal of the logic needed to solve the puzzles. Truth is, I had to look a lot harder than I originally did to find the logic to solve the puzzles. It's not so straight forward, but rewardin' when you find it.  The game took me roughly about 9 hours to complete, with several of the puzzles I repeated to do it without mistakes.\n\nDo I recommend it? If you don't like game that require a lot of thinking, this may not be the game for you. It's a lot more difficult than the previous, which, as you can see, can be frustrating if you can't figure out how to see the small hints needed to solve the puzzle. If you're in for the challenge, go for it, but perhaps wait for the game to be on sale.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you liked Hexcells, Hexcells Plus is going to infuriate you. Hexcells is like Minesweeper with logic, but Hexcells Plus is like Minesweeper with less logic and more guessin'. In the first few levels, I was reduced to guessin' in order to solve the puzzles. By 3-1, I didn't even get have way through the puzzle without having to guess.\n\nUnlike Hexcells, Hexcells Plus has become more of a guessing game. Sure you can get the first couple quite normally, but eventually, you reach a point where you are just stuck. No matter what you look at, there is nothing that can help further your advances in the level and you are stuck with making a guess. Multiple guesses, even.\n\nIt's another 30 levels, but they throw the later level things from Hexcells a lot earlier and add other additions, such as ? hexagons. But I could not make it past World 3 without gettin' up and punchin' a wall due to the amount of guessing I had to do.\n\nHonestly, this game just made me really angry. I do not recommend it. I recommend Hexcells, but not Hexcells Plus.\n\nIf you believe that it's still a game of logic, by all means, prove me wrong! I really would love to see what I'm missin' with these puzzles.","February 24, 2014","true","9.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Once you've completed each level they have about as much replayability as a solved sudoku. The game itself takes about 2-3 hours to solve and yet another hour to master (solve without making any mistakes at all). So far so good, it's more or less the same thing as picking up one of those puzzle books in the book store. A fun short collection of puzzles.\n\nMy problem is that, unlike a book, the game forces you to solve the levels in a certain order, where the "harder" ones are locked until completion of the first ones. That in itself might not have been so bad if it wasn't for the fact that the game just DELETED MY SAVED PROGRESS.

I have played the original Hexcells and quite enjoyed it, getting perfect on each level. While I liked the first game my only problem with it was the few occasions where the game forced you to guess, with literally no way to logically figure out a puzzle without risking a mistake, and having to try it again if you were going for perfect scores. Hexcells Plus claims to be more difficult, but I feel this isn't due to any real increase in difficulty, but due to artificial difficulty, particularly directed towards players who try to get perfect scores. I've finished the first three worlds, halfway through the game at this point. There have not been any new mechanics which make the game more difficult introduced, but I believe every level so far I have had to restart due to being forced to take a risk and failing. There is no logical way to solve the puzzles correctly on your first try, and the game turns into repeating levels over and over while trying to remember what to do with the spaces that have no way to be figured out. If you look at more traditional, non video game puzzles, there is usually a way to solve them without resorting to guesswork. This would have been easily possible with Hexcells Plus but the developers chose not to so they could artificially enhance the sense of difficulty. I really don't understand how this game has gotten so much praise when it's such a terrible sequel and none of the levels are well designed.\n\nSummary: Levels force you to guess rather than using logic, very poor level design overall compared to the first game.","February 26, 2015","false","1.8"," 0 of 9 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","9","0","0"

Whereas the first game might have a valid complaint of being a bit too quick and easy to complete(I acquired all acheivements in about 3 hours), it helps set up the foundation of game 2, in which the difficulty curves up must faster.  This game also continues to add a few new rules to change up the gameplay and increase the difficulty.\n\nThis game is for you if you enjoy a mixture of minesweeper and logic problems, especially if you are wanting a somewhat greater challenge over the first game.

If you haven’t played the first Hexcells, then you should either play that before playing Hexcells Plus, or just play Hexcells Inifinte (the last part of this review will cover that more).\n\nWhat I will go over is what’s new and different to Hexcells Plus compared to the first game in the series. The short answer: not much. Hexcells Plus is basically the next series of levels after the final ones in the first Hexcells game. It does re-introduce the mechanics found in the first game, but its difficulty has a sharper spike, and it’s (thankfully) quite a bit more difficult to complete. It only has 10 more levels than the first game (making a total of 36 in Plus), it takes quite a bit longer to complete than the first did, Plus in more in the range of 8-10 hours, as opposed to the scant 2 of the first\n\nNow, what’s new about Plus? Well, it introduces two new types of cells to the game. Vacant cells that have a question mark instead of a number in them, simply not indicating how many adjacent cells contain hexes. The other type is a blue hex that contains a number, indicating how many blue hexes are within a 2 cell radius. These two mechanics add a lot more difficulty to the game, and overall make it more enjoyable.\n\nThat added difficulty spike is also why my two criticisms from the first game are even more noteworthy than before. Those being: 1). An option to save your progress mid-stage to resume later, something I once again get around by taking a screenshot to glance at when re-doing my progress if I need to stop playing before I can complete a stage. 2). A way to test out potential solutions without actually applying them yet (essentially like Picross’ overlay feature). This would be far more useful here than in the first game given the more complicated puzzles, and needing to look at how all the different numbers indicating hexes interact with each so that you can determine which cells have hexes and which do not.\n\nNone-the-less, Hexcells Plus is still a fun puzzle game. If you’ve already played the first game, then this one serves as a fine continuation to it, offering what is essentially a hard mode. If you’ve not played any Hexcells games, then either pick up the complete pack when it’s on sale for under $3, or get just the third and final game Hexcells Infinite, as it offers a level generator, so it offers more gameplay, if you only want one.","February 25, 2015","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Mr. Brown, excellent job.\n\nThis is, as far as I'm concerned, a perfect logic puzzle game.  The graphics are clean.  The rules get explained once and you're on your own with the elements.  There are a few more hint types.  They won't get introduced all at the same time, but by the last two sets of worlds you're on your own and the puzzles are not easy.  However, every puzzle has a logical solution.  You do not need to guess at anytime.  If you figure out the logic they will build on those methods.  If you randomly guess you can win and derive zero enjoyment from the game--or, you can be the wacko like me, who every time I made a mistake I restarted.  I was determined to figure it all out and I did--but there were some puzzles that took me a few hours to get through--and then I'd see the new method I was supposed to use, or the set of clues I overlooked and then the puzzle would get solved in another 10 minutes.\n\nIf you like logic puzzles, this game is for you.

Hexcells Plus is far more difficult than the original and for me, that sapped some of the fun out of it.  I LOVE the original Hexcells and recommend it wholeheartedly.  It's a casual, relaxing little game that introduces you to some new puzzles that will stretch your mind a little by challenging you to think in a new way.  A lot of people compare it to Minesweeper, with the major distinction being that you never have to guess in Hexcells.  You can reach the solution to each puzzle with logic alone.  The difficulty curve on the original is great and most likely the whole way through you're going to have a smile on your face and feel enough of a challenge as new methods are introduced.  Is it going to leave you wanting more?   More than likely.  That's where Hexcells Plus comes in and why I was really looking forward to it.  Did it provide me with more Hexcells? Yes.  Did it give me more of the Hexcells I love? No.  The new puzzle solving techniques introduced in Hexcells Plus, although a logical progression, take it too far.  What the original Hexcells has in common with Minesweeper (other than searching a grid to mark empty and occupied tiles) is an addictive simplicity.  In Hexcells Plus, by making things more complicated to up the difficulty level, some of that charming simplicity is lost and sorely missed.\nBottom Line - Hexcells Plus is not simply more Hexcells.  It will most appeal, I think, to people who felt the original was too easy.  I thought the orignal was just right.  Hexcells Plus isn't a bad game by any means and I'm happy to support the developer but it's hard not to compare it to the original and be a little disappointed.","May 4, 2014","true","21.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are even a few times when you'll have to make a connection between two clues, but for the most part you won't go outside the realm of 1 or 2-step logical inferences. If you like logic puzzles, if you enjoy spending half an hour looking at the same thing thinking to yourself "I don't know what to do...", if you want to relax with a calm, quiet brain teaser accompanied by a faint sedate atmospheric audio, or if you just already played the first one and need another set of puzzles to work through, this is the game for you.","May 8, 2014","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I went straight on to Hexcells Plus...\n\nTo give you an indication of the difference in difficulty, Hexcells Plus took me around 20 hours to unlock and perfect every level, without any guides or external assistance. The majority of that time was in a couple of levels in world 5 and a couple more in world 6, which had a particularly large number of hexes to be found - I was going for perfects first time round on every map, so any time I made more than 1 mistake I restarted straight away!\n\nI thought that the step up in terms of difficulty from Hexcells to Hexcells Plus was a good amount. The introduction of an additional mechanic was a nice feature as well.  If I had any issue at all, I'd say that the difficulty could have been ramped up more evenly between each world.\n\nWould strongly recommend this for a logic/puzzle game fan. As with Hexcells, the interface is crisp, clean and responsive too... so even more reason to give it a go!\n\nI would advise playing through the first game to get yourself up to speed naturally on how all the mechanics work as well, but it's certainly not a requirement to play Plus.","April 4, 2014","true","31.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Players are presented with an orange grid comprised to hexagons and it is up to them to determine whether these cells belong to the blue pattern or not (black cells). The black cells not part of the pattern have a number in them to indicate how many blue cells are adjacent to them, thus providing a clue as to how to proceed.\nAfter completing a puzzle the player is awarded blue hexcells based on the amount of mistakes made; these in time accumulate to unlock one of five new areas - allowing you to complete more difficult puzzles. Some areas also introduce new clues and rules to help you, making the puzzles more complex over time.\nNew additions for the puzzles include blue cells with a number that denotes how many other blue cells are present within a two-cell radius and black cells with a question mark, making it impossible to know whether there are any adjacent blue cells.\n\nAlthough similar to Minesweeper as mentioned, there is a key difference: there is always a logical next step. You never have to take a gamble so if you feel stuck, take a step back and focus on another area.\n\nWhy I recommend the game\nHexcells Plus is a very simple puzzle game in its visual design. The menu is simple and provides the players with the option of turning the ambient music on or off and selecting one of three save slots. The same can be said for the puzzles themselves; a grid of hexagons on a white backdrop. To me this is good design, as I'm here for the puzzles and that's where the focus clearly lies.\nThe puzzles themselves are interesting and more difficult than the original Hexcells, which is a plus.\n\nHowever, multiple problems I had with the original game are also present here. For instance, it is still not possible to erase a save slot so starting completely from scratch is not an option if all three slots are in use.\nMy biggest problem with Hexcells Plus is that, like its predecesor, there is no option to save mid-puzzle forcing you to either finish it or redo the part you already completed next time.\n\nAll that being said, as I have recommended Hexcells and this game is an improvement with the new rules and harder difficulty, I would encourage those interested in puzzle games to give this one a try.","August 30, 2015","true","23.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you haven’t played the first Hexcells, then you should either play that before playing Hexcells Plus, or just play Hexcells Inifinte (the last part of this review will cover that more).\n\nWhat I will go over is what’s new and different to Hexcells Plus compared to the first game in the series. The short answer: not much. Hexcells Plus is basically the next series of levels after the final ones in the first Hexcells game. It does re-introduce the mechanics found in the first game, but its difficulty has a sharper spike, and it’s (thankfully) quite a bit more difficult to complete. It only has 10 more levels than the first game (making a total of 36 in Plus), it takes quite a bit longer to complete than the first did, Plus in more in the range of 8-10 hours, as opposed to the scant 2 of the first\n\nNow, what’s new about Plus? Well, it introduces two new types of cells to the game. Vacant cells that have a question mark instead of a number in them, simply not indicating how many adjacent cells contain hexes. The other type is a blue hex that contains a number, indicating how many blue hexes are within a 2 cell radius. These two mechanics add a lot more difficulty to the game, and overall make it more enjoyable.\n\nThat added difficulty spike is also why my two criticisms from the first game are even more noteworthy than before. Those being: 1). An option to save your progress mid-stage to resume later, something I once again get around by taking a screenshot to glance at when re-doing my progress if I need to stop playing before I can complete a stage. 2). A way to test out potential solutions without actually applying them yet (essentially like Picross’ overlay feature). This would be far more useful here than in the first game given the more complicated puzzles, and needing to look at how all the different numbers indicating hexes interact with each so that you can determine which cells have hexes and which do not.\n\nNone-the-less, Hexcells Plus is still a fun puzzle game. If you’ve already played the first game, then this one serves as a fine continuation to it, offering what is essentially a hard mode. If you’ve not played any Hexcells games, then either pick up the complete pack when it’s on sale for under $3, or get just the third and final game Hexcells Infinite, as it offers a level generator, so it offers more gameplay, if you only want one.","February 25, 2015","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Players are presented with an orange grid comprised to hexagons and it is up to them to determine whether these cells belong to the blue pattern or not (black cells). The black cells not part of the pattern have a number in them to indicate how many blue cells are adjacent to them, thus providing a clue as to how to proceed.\nAfter completing a puzzle the player is awarded blue hexcells based on the amount of mistakes made; these in time accumulate to unlock one of five new areas - allowing you to complete more difficult puzzles. Some areas also introduce new clues and rules to help you, making the puzzles more complex over time.\nNew additions for the puzzles include blue cells with a number that denotes how many other blue cells are present within a two-cell radius and black cells with a question mark, making it impossible to know whether there are any adjacent blue cells.\n\nAlthough similar to Minesweeper as mentioned, there is a key difference: there is always a logical next step. You never have to take a gamble so if you feel stuck, take a step back and focus on another area.\n\nWhy I recommend the game\nHexcells Plus is a very simple puzzle game in its visual design. The menu is simple and provides the players with the option of turning the ambient music on or off and selecting one of three save slots. The same can be said for the puzzles themselves; a grid of hexagons on a white backdrop. To me this is good design, as I'm here for the puzzles and that's where the focus clearly lies.\nThe puzzles themselves are interesting and more difficult than the original Hexcells, which is a plus.\n\nHowever, multiple problems I had with the original game are also present here. For instance, it is still not possible to erase a save slot so starting completely from scratch is not an option if all three slots are in use.\nMy biggest problem with Hexcells Plus is that, like its predecesor, there is no option to save mid-puzzle forcing you to either finish it or redo the part you already completed next time.\n\nAll that being said, as I have recommended Hexcells and this game is an improvement with the new rules and harder difficulty, I would encourage those interested in puzzle games to give this one a try.","August 30, 2015","true","23.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

About half-way through the game, it throws yet another curve ball with a new, well-implemented mechanic where players now work with the knowledge of how many hexes are within two spaces in any direction of a given space (the game thankfully provides a visual aid for this mechanic).\n\nThe puzzles here are much more challenging, many of them significantly more complex than anything in the first game (and are actually harder than many of the ones this game's sequel, Hexcells Infinite, offers). They take quite a bit of patience and care to complete without making a mistake (I finished the first game with all perfect solutions in three hours; Hexcells Plus took me close to twelve).\n\nThe same issue with replayability exists in this version of Hexcells. Because the puzzles are always the same, there is little reason to play them again beyond trying to complete them without making a mistake. It is also possible to learn the patterns without doing the hard logical detective work, making those replay attempts for a perfect play a bit less satisfying.\n\nEven with this issue, Hexcells Plus is still more of what made the original Hexcells a triumph: the same brilliant mechanics featuring well-crafted puzzles and an ambient soundtrack that keeps players relaxed yet focused. Only this time it will push the brain even more.\n\nI recommend Hexcells Plus to anyone who enjoys a good logic-based puzzle - though I strongly recommend finishing the first game before taking this master class in puzzling.","June 28, 2015","true","11.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

On the whole, though, I'm all for it!\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the game, it's very similar to Sudoku, which more people are probably familiar with. The big difference is that you don't have the same structure in every game; instead, you get levels with vastly different layouts.\nThere's never a need to "guess" or risk a move that might be wrong. If you combine the information at each turn, you'll find at least one correct move.\nEach moves reveals more information, which forms the game cycle.\n\nThe first game was too easy. Why? Essentially, because you always had a group of valid moves at each turn. This meant that, even if you missed one or two, you could easily make significant progress. This time around, there's a new mechanic: '?' tiles. These don't reveal useful information.\nMany people have reacted negatively to this, but it's not as bad as it seems. I would even say it's necessary, to increase the difficulty.\n\nThis way, you lose the number of valid moves, so you need to combine the more subtle information you get to reach the answer. With bigger levels, information is quite sparse, and you can get some really tricky puzzles.\n\nThat's basically what Hexcells Plus does that its predecessor did not. The last game was fairly easy, while some of these puzzles can take you tens of minutes, if not an hour.\n\nStill, the game is still fair, giving you at least one valid move, if you're carefully looking for it!\n\nThe biggest "fault" I find with this new tile is this: the previous game was surprisingly replayable! Since you always had several moves to make, you could choose very different paths to the solution. Each new path seemeed almost like a new level... which made a puzzle game replayable!

I went straight on to Hexcells Plus...\n\nTo give you an indication of the difference in difficulty, Hexcells Plus took me around 20 hours to unlock and perfect every level, without any guides or external assistance. The majority of that time was in a couple of levels in world 5 and a couple more in world 6, which had a particularly large number of hexes to be found - I was going for perfects first time round on every map, so any time I made more than 1 mistake I restarted straight away!\n\nI thought that the step up in terms of difficulty from Hexcells to Hexcells Plus was a good amount. The introduction of an additional mechanic was a nice feature as well.  If I had any issue at all, I'd say that the difficulty could have been ramped up more evenly between each world.\n\nWould strongly recommend this for a logic/puzzle game fan. As with Hexcells, the interface is crisp, clean and responsive too... so even more reason to give it a go!\n\nI would advise playing through the first game to get yourself up to speed naturally on how all the mechanics work as well, but it's certainly not a requirement to play Plus.","April 4, 2014","true","31.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a fun twist on what is essentially minesweeper and nonograms.

Whereas the first game might have a valid complaint of being a bit too quick and easy to complete(I acquired all acheivements in about 3 hours), it helps set up the foundation of game 2, in which the difficulty curves up must faster.  This game also continues to add a few new rules to change up the gameplay and increase the difficulty.\n\nThis game is for you if you enjoy a mixture of minesweeper and logic problems, especially if you are wanting a somewhat greater challenge over the first game.

This game can be completed with pure logic and process of elimination, though the difficulty curve on this additional content is much steeper. If you're up for the challenge, then go ahead! It's definetly worth the price. Here is my original Review for "Hexcells".\n\nOriginally posted by Enix:A compelling puzzlegame, as an obvious big brother of Minesweeper.\n\nContent\nMany puzzles await your solving. Go through different levels of difficulty and solve all of the puzzles to get to 100%. Can you get every one with no mistakes?\n\nHexcells (apparent from the name) adds new dimensions to the classical game of Minesweeper: More adjacent fields to one hexagon as well as border numbers, which indicate how many fields of the pattern are in a line/row/diagonale. Each boder number can indicate different things, everything is explained within the game. No need to rush things. You are now thinking outside of hexcells.\n\nSound & Music\nShallow but fitting background soundtracks and sounds. Nothing special, but that wasn't needed here. The soundtrack and soundeffects change every once and a while when you complete a puzzle.\n\nGraphics\nDon't expect anything here. The game is primarily a puzzle game, so no high end graphics or effects. The design does its deeds and fulfills its task. Visuals are never irritating and do what they need to do.\n\nWeakpoints\nSometimes, portions of the soundtrack are a little too high-pitched in my opinion. This can get annoying, if you are not used to hearing the same sounds over and over again. They are adjustable ingame though, from soundeffects only to completely mute.\n\nConcluding Thoughts\nGreat puzzlegame, compelling, challenging, tricky but fair. Nice soundtrack, nice sounds, simple gameplay yet sometimes mindwreckingly hard. Don't worry, if you are the enthusiastic puzzle type of gamer, you will get used to loving this game!","August 23, 2015","true","14.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you found the original Hexcells too hard, stop here because this sequel is a LOT more complex and harder. The original took me a little under 2 hours and wise nice and smooth to get into the system.\nThis however is in another league, it took me almost 12 hours to complete. Of course you can always guess your way through it, but there's no fun in that. The brilliance of this game lies in the fact that all puzzles can be solved by simply using logical thinking. There's never any guess work needed. On the downside, since there's so many variables to keep track of, it sometimes takes prolonged staring at the screen to figure out what move is next.\nWhich is also part of the greatness in the system. You sometimes have to hop from the left side to the right side of the puzzle or from bottom to top in order to make the next step. A nice change from doing things linear.\n\nAlso the game comes with a new smoothing soundtrack, a bit calm spacy tunes with no lyrics. Keeps you very focused (at least it did for me) but it can get a bit dull when you're stuck for a longer period.\n\nAll in all a worthy sequel, much much harder than the original but highly recommended if you're into logical problem solving or puzzles in general. If you dont want the spend too much get all three games in a package, or if you simple want to test out if this game is anything for you, start with the original.","January 2","true","13.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All of the first opus's flaws are corrected, basically. The music doesn't become annoying anymore after a few minutes. The OST is made of great, relaxing tunes that get you through the puzzles. The game doesn't feel like a big tutorial but like a real game now. Of course, it's all based on simple math and logic, so it's still easy as pie. The first four worlds are a breeze and are merely an introduction to worlds 5 and 6, where the real challenge awaits. No real difficulty, no traps, no vicious designs though. You just need to look closely at the board, to watch every number, every line, every intersection to figure out how to go further.\n\nAll this game needs to be perfect is an Undo button. How often did I have a "mistake" because I accidentally clicked the board (two "mistakes" in a level and you're basically playing for nothing)! On the other hand, it's kinda good, gives you a bit of stress, makes the game feel more hardcore.\n\nBottom line: if you like Minesweeper (or games like Kakuro or Sudoku) you're gonna LOVE this. Still a bit much to charge 3 € for it, especially since there are only 30 levels and basically zero replay value (I've seen many free games with more content than this one), but for a short game it's relatively original, a solid concept, and lots of fun. Your pick. If it's on sale though, you HAVE to get it.\n\nLet's ignore the price, and give it a nice 7,5/10.","October 5, 2015","true","30.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

On the whole, though, I'm all for it!\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the game, it's very similar to Sudoku, which more people are probably familiar with. The big difference is that you don't have the same structure in every game; instead, you get levels with vastly different layouts.\nThere's never a need to "guess" or risk a move that might be wrong. If you combine the information at each turn, you'll find at least one correct move.\nEach moves reveals more information, which forms the game cycle.\n\nThe first game was too easy. Why? Essentially, because you always had a group of valid moves at each turn. This meant that, even if you missed one or two, you could easily make significant progress. This time around, there's a new mechanic: '?' tiles. These don't reveal useful information.\nMany people have reacted negatively to this, but it's not as bad as it seems. I would even say it's necessary, to increase the difficulty.\n\nThis way, you lose the number of valid moves, so you need to combine the more subtle information you get to reach the answer. With bigger levels, information is quite sparse, and you can get some really tricky puzzles.\n\nThat's basically what Hexcells Plus does that its predecessor did not. The last game was fairly easy, while some of these puzzles can take you tens of minutes, if not an hour.\n\nStill, the game is still fair, giving you at least one valid move, if you're carefully looking for it!\n\nThe biggest "fault" I find with this new tile is this: the previous game was surprisingly replayable! Since you always had several moves to make, you could choose very different paths to the solution. Each new path seemeed almost like a new level... which made a puzzle game replayable! That was great.\nThis time, that doesn't happen (not to the same degree, anyway) simply because you have less options.\n\nOverall, this is just as great as the previous one! The mentioned disadvantage is undermined by the fact that it's more challeging, and thus brings something new into the formula.","October 22, 2015","true","12.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

" marks, etc... But the one thing that makes the Hexcell games shine is the level design! Unlike minesweeper, the levels are not random but designed. Because of this, you'll never encounter a case where you have to take a random choice and have 50% chances of winning. There will always be a path to the end of the level and we you get stuck, it's more both frustrating and motivating because you know there is a path to find.\n\nHexcell Plus introduce some features that were not present in Hexcell and is a nice improvement on the difficulty. Hexcell was easy for me untill the end of the game but Hexcell Plus got harder sooner. I even had to replay some puzzles at least five times to get the perfection.\n\nIf Hexcell was too easy for you but fun enough, this might be more entertaining. A fun minesweeper inspired puzzle of average difficulty!","January 26, 2015","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Seranth/recommended/271900/","Seranth","Seranth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Seranth/","1189 products in account","A logic puzzle that is like a combination of Minesweeper and Kakuro. Simple design & graphics, fitting music. You have numbered tiles that tell how many adjacent mines there are. And later on there are numbers outside the grid that tell how many mines are in that column. The Plus edition adds numbers inside mine tiles that tell how many mines are within two tiles. You use the information given to get through tiles and eventually uncover the whole area. There are no game overs (so you can continue on despite guessing or making mistakes) but you can do the puzzles without guesswork. However, this game is noticably more difficult and requires much deeper reading of possibilities than the original title.\n\nThe controls are pretty simple (left click to mark as a mine, right click to reveal). You can also right click on column numbers/mine numbers to hide them. It's not very obvious but you can access the menu/restart the stage by clicking on the word MENU on the top left corner.\n\nI enjoy logic puzzles and these kept me entertained for a several hours (I spent a good amount of time just thinking about the problems and eventually got hints from people on the forums).\n\nThere is no save option (like in the original title). However, I found it a lot more annoying in this game because each puzzle requires a lot more time to solve. A physical sudoku or crossword puzzle on paper can be put away for later but this game clears all progress when you leave. I ended up taking screenshots of my progress so I could start from where I left off. [Edit: Hexcells Infinite allows you to save progress]\n\nIf there aren't saves because of save abuse (for perfect levels), then saves could be automatically deleted after they're loaded. And it seems like the devs could make it beyond the power of copy+paste if they really wanted to combat save abuse.\n\nOn a side note, misclicks sometimes ruin runs for a perfect score. I just repeated the puzzle but it could be nice to have an option that requires two clicks instead of one for those prone to misclicking.\n\nA pretty big step up in difficulty from the original Hexcells, I think it has risen a few steps above casual and into the enthusiast level of difficulty. If you like logic puzzles like Sudoku/Kakuro you should try the original Hexcells first. If you enjoyed Hexcells and are looking for a new and harder challenge, this will probably be your cup of tea.","January 6","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As you progress through the levels, you are also introduced to some new mechanics accompained by a tutorial level to make sure that you understand them. Because the puzzles are carefully and wonderfully designed, you never have to guess your next move, but finding it gets hard in the later puzzles. The interface is clean and the sound effects are cool. Hexcells is easy, Hexcells Plus gets harder in the second half and Hexcells Infinite steps back a little at the beginning, but in the end offers the most challenging puzzles. It also comes with a seed-based puzzle generator, adding 999,999,999 additional puzzles (even if they aren't hand crafted, they're still good). My recommendation is that you get and play all three games in order, but if you can only pick one, pick Hexcells Infinite, it's main levels difficulty is nicely spread not to mention the puzzle generator.","January 7","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Correctly uncover all tiles to finish the puzzle. But various other visual clues have been added to the mix, such as: digits telling you the number of blue hexes in a row or column (or diagonal); numbered blue hexes indicating the amount of other blue tiles in its vicinity; question marks hiding information from you; and other intersting hint systems that let you deduce the locations of blue tiles without resorting to luck.\n\nAs far as I know, it is always possible to deduce the tile locations using the hints given. No more of these 50/50 chances that occur all to frequently at the end of a game of Minesweeper. And mistakes are allowed too, you can continue the puzzle even after clicking on a wrong tile. Though you need to keep mistakes at a minimum to unlock everything.\n\nThe presentation is clean, simple and slick. Cool visual aids are provided that help you easily identify all the tiles of a row, or all the hexes in a 2-tile radius around a numbered blue hex. These are particularly useful in big and unusually shaped puzzles (unlike Minesweeper, the shape of the grid varies from puzzle to puzzle).\n\nThe electro-ambient music is also very fitting for a game that requires your full concentration. Notes are played each time you click on a tile, merging beautifully with the ongoing music. It is a detail, but it certainly adds to the experience.\n\nAll in all, if you like this kind of puzzle game, you cannot pass this up.","January 20","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It doesn't have many levels (only 36) but it's something like 5-6 hours of entertainment (I didn't finish it yet).\n\nLevels are great- it's really amaing that puzzles with this level of complexity doesn't required any guessing (only one level for first 30 that I solved required guess (but maybe I didn't saw something)).\n\nIf you think that you'll like this game (from screenshots and description) - you will :)","May 4","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a well crafted little puzzle game with a range of challenging but beatable puzzles. I picked up Hexcells, Hexcells Plus and Hexcells infinite as a pack in the sale for around 3 Euros and I am extremely happy with the purchase. Hexcells took me around 2 and a half hours to fully complete, whereas Hexcells Plus raises the complexity of the puzzles and took me probably closer to seven hours (although I do like to take my time). Overall I would definitely recommend it if you like logic puzzles like Sudoku.\n","May 3","true","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Great, creative puzzle game that's way more than just Minesweeper with hexagons. Sometimes you might get stuck, but you never have to guess; look a little closer, and the clues lead to the next step.

Becomes more oblique with having to remember what everything means, but at least numbers in blue hexes are more intuitive than different bracketed numbers. Still fun, similar soundtrack to the original (tolerable but ignorable) and generally addicitive, though with puzzles that require even more of a hunt to find the number you haven't completed yet (because there are more numbers to sort through).\n\nIf you liked the first, get it, if you didn't don't bother. Start with the first game regardless as it will show you what all three games are about. They go on sale often enough, and the discount for getting all three isn't significant enough to not try one before getting the rest.","May 21","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Casual.\n\n(this is a copy of my review for the first itiration of the game)\n\nThis is not a logic puzzle, there is *definite* 50/50 moments (like minesweeper) that you just have to guess. This can get frustrating if you've gotta catch 'em all, but I advise adjusting your mindset, because this can be a peaceful release of a few minutes here and there.\n\nPlay it like a cross between a nonogram and minesweeper. You can unlock all of the later levels if you just screen shot your current one (before finishing) and go again, so don't stress about that error, and retry in a second to ensure you have enough blues to unlock the later levels. You don't have to high score it, just unlock the later levels, so do enough to do that and you're good :-).","May 26","true","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
