In my humble opinion its one of the best strategy games ever made. just ignore the metascore. many german magazines rated it higher than rome 1.\nand i dont understand why people here think this game is simple. it is actually pretty complex and provides loads of statistics and data to the player - some of it maybe a bit "hidden" for the superficial players. like already mentioned, the land battles can be very challenging, even for experienced armchair-generals -but i dont consider this to be a bad thing...at all. Also this game had sea battles long before the tw-series and they still look fantastic. but the best thing about this game is still the music. especially the tracks that play during the map-mode are incredibly beautiful. check this one out guys, you won't regret it. for 3 euros its a steal.","April 12, 2014","true","2.5"," 108 of 122 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","108","122","0","6"

When I did look into it though, the information  was already enough to sway me into buying, hearing that it was a similar to the likes of Empire Total War. This however being a budget title, very cheap, and well did not take too much of a computer to run. That’s the basis of what convinced me to buy it, currently having  quite a weak laptop to run games on, so I gave it a try.\n\nWhen you first get into this game, it does take a while to progress through the campaign, its often very confusing at the start as-well. You can start to see the elements in which are similar to Empire TW, but do notice that its clearly not as good, which brought this game down for me. As I said earlier, it takes a while to actually do anything in this game, and so need to be patient, keeping it calm in the early stages. Im going to be honest, you attack anyone early on, your going to get f***ed up pretty easily. Once you have an army etc, it gets interesting, you can trade, form alliances, but that’s pretty much it. While playing this game it always felt as if I was playing a decent title though, graphics are good for the age, but you do have to realise that this game really is just for those who cannot run Empire. I would not purchase this game if I had Empire Total War there in my library, I just wouldn’t! Its for people who like a good RTS Strategy game, but may not have the option of good gaming rig to play them games on. But at least there is an option for players, a decent strategy title like Imperial Glory, requiring little to run really. Its ok for that set of aspects.\n\nIt takes a while to experience any kind of glory really, but its a great option for those who like a good rts game, its a game that can run on just about anything.\nOverall:\n\n+ Decent Graphics\n+ Professional Look\n+ Easy To Run\n+ Gameplay Is Pretty Smooth\n\n- Feels Like Second Best\n- Lacks In Storytelling\n- Not Going To Win Any Awards\n\nGood 7.5/10\n\nThat goes it for my short Imperial Glory Steam Review\n\nThanks,\n\nThe-Sentinel-Gamer","September 6, 2014","true","7.7"," 44 of 52 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","44","52","0","3"

This title has about 10 years old and for a game made that long ago, is one of the best strategic games i ever played ! So, i got this game for free in some giveway from a retailer website. Got it cuz i already played alot of Total War series and i´m really into this historic and strategic games.\n\nAt the beginning it didn´t suprise me and was kind of boring actually, cuz i was used to other kind of game rules and gameplay (from Rome Total War mainly). After a couple hours playing i really got into the athmosfear of the game and i started to enjoy it.\n\nIf you compare this game with Total War series, you rly can even do more things in this game than in the Rome Total War ( I compare it with RTW cuz both were made/launched around the same year ).\n\nHere you can have ships/nautic battles, while in RTW Battles like that are just automatic, while here, in the battle contact, soldiers mix themselves and you dont even know who´s dying if you don´t look at the number of troops, RTW has move battle consistency, better options and gameplay and a bigger map.\n\nI must also freeze the map rotation issue, while in Total War series you get a different battle map every time you move, in this game, the map is only 1 per partition (region) what, in my opinion is not a big of a problem, just a small detail.\n\nThe graphics are pretty good for a game that was made 10 years ago, with nice details, what deffenitely provides you a good gameplay.\nIf you are thinking about playing this game online with other people forget it, you won´t find anyone to play with (i speak for myself cuz i live in a small country and in a +or- remote location but maybe you have lucky).\n\nOnce again, you can totally compare this game to Empire Total War due the historic timeline. If you ever played a Total War title and enjoyed it i totally recomend this game to you, its a rly good option to TW series, you should give it a try !\n\nIt is a really nice game and for 5eur it´s completelly worth, even tought you can it cheaper in promotions...\n\n7/10\n\nPS: Sorry about some english mistakes, i think everyone gets it","August 19, 2015","true","18.0"," 36 of 41 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","36","41","0","0"

If you are seriously struggling with the Hardcore RTS games like Total War for example. And want an easier and less frustrating experience. This game is for you.\n\nIn Imperial Glory you control the major superpowers of that era. And basically it boils down to two options. a Score victory or Total Victory. If you know what these two options are then this game should be a piece of cake. Plus the tutorial mode really helps out fresh RTS players to understand the basic controls of how to manage your empire. The User Interface once the game starts is simple to understand, plus all of the options tells you which key on your keyboard to press for a quick look around.\n\nThe battles in this game are once again, easy to understand.

It's easier than the others, it's fast, like, if you are in college or something and you don't really have time, a battle would take like 10-15 minutes, and it's very cheap. However it is old and some mecghanics are outdated but it's a really nice experience. So, let me finish, if you are a newbie and want to try Total War Napoleon, Empire, Rome, Shogun, or Men of War and Company of Heroes series, I'd suggest that you should try this game first. It's easy to understand, not very complicated.

If you have ever played old school strategy games its just like that. Its like Medieval one if you have ever played it. You get to play as five factions france,Britian,Prussia,Austria,Russia. there are many other smaller factions such as spain,ottomans,portugal,hanover,egypt,sweden and so on. I have to say though that I am kinda sad that you can't play as spain and the ottomans because they are two of the bigger small factions in the game.  This game can be very hard in the early parts of the game because if you invade one of the smaller nations other nations will come in and fight you and you wont be able to hold all of them off because you don't have the military to fight them, So pick your battles carefully. The way you get allies is by throwing money at them and getting them into your alliance that way, Once you have reached 100% likeness then they will join your faction. they can get liberated by having a enemy nation take their capital back. The ingame battles are nothing to brag about, their okay but if you spam a lot of cav you will win the day, there still fun. The only thing that makes me mad is that I feel like the whole game is being rushed and that time flys way too fast! and smaller nations join bigger nations way too soon, but that is just what I think. I know that there is a bug where after you win a battle it crashes so I would look up the fix online before ♥♥♥♥♥ing about it here on steam. I would also like to say there are a few mods on the internet that help fix the OP militia who can just into hand to hand combat and destroy your whole army xD Other then a few of these things its a great game and I love it so much, I wish there was a world war one mod for this game because I feel like it would be so good. Last words though is this is totally worth the five dollars or less, Its like you got yourself a sub just try it out and see if you like it. But really someone make that mod idea, I will give you idea and ♥♥♥♥ just please....Someone take up the sword and do it!","February 23, 2015","true","31.8"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","18","20","0","0"

This was my first game I played, purchased the CD.  Its pretty straight forward, no complications.  When I saw this on Steam, snapped it for $4. and some cents, It has multi-player but I have not used that aspect?  So can't comment!  But the game is very addictive, with plenty of action.  You are given several countries to lead.   If you have never played game, don't choose, Austria.  It is the most difficult country to defend because it is surrounded by enemies.  Which love to gang up on the about the first 3-4 turns of the game.  Once you have played the game and get the hang of it, try Austria.   Each country or empire has a special strenght, the British, their Royal Navy and industry.  France, professional armies and cannon.  Prussia, military tactics.  Russia, population and plenty of territory to retreat from their attackers!   Plus u get to gobble up all of the secondary countries!  But watch out, they may be allied with a more powerful empire or two.    The key is to develop your country as quickly as possible and form alliances with others in order to survive!  Plenty of action, naval battles, army battles,  foreign policy action, trade, industrial growth and political structure.  All must be monitored and nutured in order to afford those huge armies and navies.  You can even foster political unrest in other countries, once you develop a huge budget!

The people needed a good, strong leader, and because of reasons, they thought that I would fit the bill.\n\nI started doing what any person would do, spending all the money on a military, opening up trade routes, and scamming other countries into buying my "quality" materials that I was only to happy to get rid of. (we were a bit overstocked on them)\n\nIn attempts to increase government/military quality, I decided it might be best to forget about educations and hospitals to focus on more important things. Trading and Diplomacy.\n\nAs my diplomacy skills went up, I wanted to be better friends with the surrounding nations, so I gave France ten bucks to strengthen our relationship. They were not amused, and it backfired on me.\n\nWith that out of the way I decided that the best move from here was to wipe Denmark of the face of the map, for the sole reason being that it was there. I put my troops on a ship, and once I could convince them to swim to shore, I had to make a bunch of allies so I could march across other peoples land on my way to Denmark.\n\nI attack. It was a hard fight in the mountains, and we sustained heavy casulties, but we drove them back. VICTORY......until they brought in a bigger, meaner army for reinforcments and then gave me a whoopin.\n\nWith my army crippled, and thus my country, I threw in the towl. Well played Denmark, well played.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn all seriousness, I bought the game on sale for 49 cents. I don't think it's quite as big,  detailed or complex as some of the newer Total War games, but it seems easier, which is good for RTS newbs like me. With that in mind, and you don't mind outdated graphics, then you might consider giving this a try.

I had never played any of the total war games until steam had a total war weekend, and although I definitely would choose to play a total war game before i'd choose to replay this one due to the wider maps and stronger gameplay, this game does not lag behind. I'm not sure who developed this, but when i play Total War Empires, there isnt a single element of the game that doesnt lead me to believe that Total war blatantly plagarized this entire game. For being made 3 years before Rome and about 6 years before Empires, Imperial Glory beat the Total War series to the punch in Naval RTS. I see no significant difference between the Naval element of this game vs Empires Total War's Naval battles, except maybe asthetics. Even at 5 bucks this is a bargain, but if u're pinching pennies, this goes on sale often at anywhere from .99 to 2.99.\nAgain, if ure a fan of the Total War games, grand and/or real time strategies, BUY THIS GAME.\n\nPros:\n-Almost entirely Identical to total war empires minus injuh and amrika.\n-Flawless integration of RTS in this Grand Strategy\n-Fantastic Retail price\n-up to 100, 12 turn years of game play\n-Had Naval RTS 5 years before total war (Naval engine feels identical to that of Empires Total War)\n-Graphics more than adequite\n-Diplomacy is WAY more comprehensive than Total War games. In Total War Empires I felt like i could easily cheat the other nations with bribery and fake diplomacy. For instance, if i was at war with a nation, all it would take is a little cash to get a peace accord signed, which meant i could go and conquer a few territories of a nation and then afterwards i could get a peace treaty signed and keep the countries that i conquered, and generally, they wouldnt do ♥♥♥♥ about it as long as our diplomatic relations are set at "peace". In Imperial glory, I couldn't put anything past the AI and i had to genuinely practice good diplomacy to earn the trust of my fellow emperors, otherwise they reigned hell down on me. This, I think, is something Total war has never been able to master.\nCons:\n-No india or america theatre\n-RTS is somewhat limited by comparison to Total war, but not so much that u want to skip the battles. Here are my complaints of the RTS:\n=limited map diversity\n=less comprehensive defensive features\n(The next one is sort of a pro as well)\n=Occupation is a prolonged process. it takes many turns to annex a nation and requires a considerable amount of troops to do so. In retrospect, Total war adapted their own version of this by letting the people rebel throughout the game which i think makes it easier to play. So basically, this game is more challenging militarily speaking\n\nEDIT\nOH!!! and I have win 8.1 and it did crash a couple times, however the autosave is super frequent. i never lost my place the few times that it did crash, and furthermore, the crashes that i had in Total War weren't any less frequent. I've been reading a lot of the neg reviews, and it seems the only consistent complaints are the crashes. Seriously, dont let that prevent u from buying this game, especially if u like the Total war style grand/rt strategy genre at a really really really cheap price. Imperial Glory was the framework that TOTAL WAR based their games on. dont wait for the movie, read the book. Total war is the movie. Imperial Glory is the book.","October 29, 2014","true","133.2"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","10","15","2","0"

A friend got this game for me, while it was on sale for 59p. For it's age, Imperial  Glory can still compete with other, more modern games of its type. Though the graphics are not the best, the game mechanics are in many respects better than the likes of Empire and Napoleon Total War. If you have played either of these, you will be well aware than when two units clash in melee, it is not uncommon for several men from each unit to be doing nothing while a few others fight and the rest get in the way looking for an opponent. Well Imperial Glory, now 10 years old, actually doesn't do that. It was really good to watch the intense melee with everyone taking part. Though indeed the kill moves, and graphics cannot compete with the likes of Empire and Napoleon Total War, it was a nice part of the game that i really enjoyed.\n\nThe sound effects and general playstyle is very similar to that of Napoleon and Empire too, but from my short playtime, it is a lot faster and seems a lot less buggy. I like how the lines all fire pretty much at the same time, but the reloads are a bit too fast. I found the interface a bit tricky to work out, but i soon got the hang of that and everything was fine. Formations cannot be changed merely by right click and dragging the unit across the map, as you can in Empire and Napoleon, at least i couldn't get it to work like that.\n\nUnit sizes are pretty small which realy is the bggest downside to the game, and it kinda kills the realism, but really its fast paced and relatively easy playstyle really does make it a game still worthy of some respect, in many ways better than most games from the Total War series.","November 27, 2015","true","0.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

And the game gave me every kind of experience, I wanted: building fleet, founding colonies in Northen Africa, landing troops in Crimea, setting maritime blockade upon enemy's trade and hunting for his fleet etc, I really liked it.\nAdvantages of this game are:\n- developed political activity, that plays major part in the game;\n- good macroeconomics, that doesn't take much effort to held, but wouldn't alloy you to neglet it, and allows you to make some economical pressure on opponent;\n- very good global naval strategy realisation, which was the main reason for me to play it.\nThe only disadvantage I could recall after finishing the campaign is the battles, I have to play when I didn't wanted to, because of unfair battle auto-calculation.

Managing an empire in this game is a lot more smooth than Total War, as there are more resources to manage and control. Building and recruiting units are pretty straightforward and easy to understand. The combat itself is quite lacking compared to other strategy games, but for the price it is worth it. The battles are at a much smaller scale than other games that are similiar, and the terrain of battles in certain areas is basic and never changes. The naval battles are well done for the price of the game, and enjoyable if you know what you are doing. The only thing that is bad about the game is it crashes about every 3 battles and you have to redo everything since your last save (including the battle it crashed on) when this happens. The crashes happen regardless of what computer you have and can get really annoying. Other than the crashes i have no problems with the game and find it enjoyable. I would reccomend this game for its current price and am surprised at how well it was developed.

It is missing very basic things that all games like this should have like a balanced combat system, functional diplomacy, and even unit replenishment. (Unit replinishment can only happen late game if you choose a certain tech tree). The A.I  always plays defensivley in battles and it usually crashes after battles. The game has very little variety with only 5 factions to play as that all are basically the same. The A.I constantly sends offers to trade for unessicary things like food for all your money. If you deny them this deal, than you get a relationship hit with that country and after a few turns of that than they declare war on you. If you want to start a war, be ready to fight the whole map, because even your own allies will betray you and fight against you because "reasons".

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KetsaKunta/recommended/277450/","KetsaKunta","pencil [N.W.A]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KetsaKunta/","377 products in account","CAMPAIGN MAP\n\nImperial Glory takes aspects from the early Total War game Shogun, using the exact same troop movement and province control on the campaign map. The unique feature of moving your troops anywhere in a province as long as you only move to one province per turn. Moving a unit stack to a new province will simulate your men gathering supplies and getting ready to move out, thus you cannot interact with that unit again until next turn. That includes the transferring of units from barracks to armies, or armies to armies. In order to take over provinces you must move your army which consists of 3 units to the target area to immediately take it over. If an enemy army is stationed in that province you will begin a battle at the beginning of the next turn. If the targeted province is the capital of the country that you are at war with, you will begin seiging that province for however many turns depending on the quality of units you have.\n\nRESEARCH TREE\n\nThe research tree is mandatory to advance in the campaign, without any technologies you will only be able to recruit Militia, which is the most basic melee based infantry unit. Advancing in the research tree allows you to build barracks, cavalry stables, cannon depots, and other economic/cultural buildings. In order to gain a constant flow of incom you must research the trade technology to unlock trade routes to friendly countries. It is a pretty standard research tree compared to any other TW game.\n\nDIPLOMACY\n\nDiplomacy is kinda limited to the research tree as well as everything else at the beginning. You only start with 4-5 options for diplomacy until you advance further into the campaign. I'm not a big dimplomatic player anway, so I won't go further into detail.\n\nOPTIONS\n\nThe options have some variety to the graphics and sounds, the only thing I really consider not up to my standards is that the resolution doesnt go up to 1920x1080.\n\nBATTLE MAP\n\nThe battle map is very similar to a Total War game, you play as the commander using a birds eye view of the battle field to direct your troops. The troop deployment is more similar to Shogun and the actually troop manuevering is more alike Real Warfare. The combat is a very simple representation of early 19th century warfare. The front rank of line infranty are the only sprites to actually fire their weapons, while the rear two ranks sit in reserve. Obviously this would not really be the case but due to game limitations its understandable. Militia units are the most basic units that are recruitable from the very start of the game. They are only limited to melee and are sometimes very over powered, because they have more melee strength than line infantry, probably to simulate the larger numbers. The UI in the combat map makes it so you do not have to use any hotkeys if you do not want to and that is fine with me. The AI is pretty... not good to be honest. The Infantry would rather engage in melee than engage in ranged combat which can make things a little iffy strategy wise.\n\nMore will come when I continue to play the game.","September 9, 2015","true","0.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

It is most similar to  Empire: Total War , taking place in the same time period, 1700-1800. Being released in 2005 for pc and 2006 for mac, you would come to expect this game to be unapealing, especially with larger franchises that are so similar, but that is not the case. Here I am going to explain why.\n\nImperial Glory brings to the table many things that I have yet to see in a game of this style before such as population based recruiting, and missions that can give you many bonuses such as buildings being built instantly or elite units. The graphics and audio may not be the greatest, even for the time it came out, but we all have to remember that graphics and audio don't make a game.\n\nThe gameplay is where this game really shines in my eyes. Though once again similar to Empire: Total War in this aspect, it is very unique, in some ways even better than Total War. The map phase of the game, which is only in Europe, has far fewer provinces than Total War, this allows each game to be much faster and more action oriented while adding a less strategic depth making the game easier to grasp. All units are relatively small making the combat more strategy focused, though still not too difficult.\n\nPros\nUnique gameplay\nEasy to grasp\nGood replay value\nFast paced\nCheap\nNon-Linear\nDecent AI\nUnique Resources\nCons\nBad graphics and audio\nLittle to no players in multiplayer\nNot the best option\nIn the end this is just a cheap version of total war, but note,  cheap . It's a good game to buy for a few hours of fun and is well worth $5 or less, but best to buy it on sale for best value.","July 25, 2015","true","6.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nablet12/recommended/277450/","nablet12","♥♫Nablet™®","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nablet12/","161 products in account","Imperial Glory is one of the best RTS games i'd say, If you're a fan of games like Age of Empires or Divinity Dragon Commander or anything that's like that then this is your game.\n\nFor a game that's from 2005 it's still quite a blast, i'd play it for about 3-4 hours non stop and for a game like that, it's quite an achievement.\n\nAlright i'll start by saying you need to play this game for ATLEAST more than 5 hours to COMPLETELY understand how much content it has, at first it does indeed look ugly and really half-♥♥♥♥♥ with it's fair share of bugs but it's really fun, though one of the really annoying things is you can only play as one of 5 europian powers, and there's about 15 or more civils so it feels like that's been completely ignored or just rushed at devoloupment.\n\nAnyways you have two ways to play the game, A "Total Victory" type of campaign where you HAVE to unite the entire map, as in just fight every single dude who says no, or just buy every single country (except for capitals which you can't buy :<) till you get the entire world in your hands, or a "Score Victory" where you just have to get the most score. (just build build build and spam peace everywhere.) and the other way is to play one of the four battles that are all related to France and Napoleon at the early 1800's which is a bit of a shame really.\n\nThe "Total Victory" is pretty much the best way to play the game, it has the most content and would take you about 15-25 hours to complete atleast one campaign with that way.\nSince it's the best way i'll start by explaining it, first off you pick your civil, then you have one of three ways to completely dominate a country/civil, One way is just buy everything they have till they only own their capital, Then just invade that. There's also a "Peaceful" way to completely annex them via just building newspaper offices and consolates and loads of other buildings to force them to like you all the way till they give you everything they have (units - land - resources) This way is gonna cost you ALOT but it's really worth it, and of course it's worth it later on since you get like 4000 gold each turn which is abit overpowered but still is fair since you really need gold at all times along with other resources. Third way is to go with a large army with/without help of anyone else and just try to completely destroy your enemy, I'd go with peaceful since the A.I generates a big army in somewhat of a short while.\n\nNow i would NEVER recommend speedrunning this game as it's also kind of impossible, i'd say just try to get as many allies as you can and build a strong civil.\nAt first gameplay feels abit slow and also earning resources is abit slow but you quickly improve yourself same as the A.I.\nAlso the A.I devoloups quickly same as you and it fights somewhat good in battles it feels like you're not fighting an A.I, still you can get an edge over it so i'd say that's good enough.\n\nSo i said alot of things and overall the game is really good but let's start talking about the bugs and the annoying things that we all hate.\nFirst off like i said above ^ the first things you notice is there's not that many battles and or ways to play the game which feels like the just rushed it and also you can't play as every single civil.\nAnd when i said map/world map, the world isn't complete. It's mainly europe and north africa and west asia so it's really not that much, and there's not that much attention to detail, ottoman empire has just 3 territories and all of them are REALLY large, then next to it is just Egypt which feels like there could be way more attention to detail there.\nAlso when the A.I hates you, they literally hate you, they'll completely deny EVERY single political related crap you send except for improving relations with SO many resources or buying territory/land from them which also feels like they lacked detail there.\n\nAnyways to just not make this longer, Overall the game is great for a 2005 one, If it's under $10 i'd say it's a must own but more than that then it's not worth it unless it gets updated and adds more polish and attention to detail. (mind you the high/ist resolution is 1024x768) so i'd give it a 7/10","October 7, 2014","true","23.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Game in general is good , combat is so cool and clashes between units is awesome , map is huge , there isn`t any story , and it is expected, you just have to win all battles and take every territory. It has few modes like historical battles which are cool. Graphics for 2005 game are very cool , game is slow very slow at some times but it gets better after 1 hour of playing.

It is very simple, and I understand that it could definantly do with alot of simple improvements, such as range of the cannon (which is suprisingly short), and perhaps some more military diversity (There is just 4 land army unit 'types' in the game) which are your horsemen, light infantry, Infantry,  and cannons. Ships are just the same.\n\nBut this game is old, very old, made in 2005. Shouldn't be too suprising that some of these things are missing. And crashes, too, it's definantly not meant to run on modern computers. But it's still a good game, you don't have to be the world's smartest genius to win the game, and neither do you have to conquer the world with all-powerful military might. There is a score win system in the game, which I like after playing a game such as Empire: Total War where the only real way to win is to shoot everything that isn't you. I mean, Empire, not a bad game by any means, but I think it could have gone with some diversity when it comes to winning.\n\nSo, really, I think this is a good game and while it does have problems because of it's age, it's still a good, simple game, plenty of enjoyment out of it.","September 18, 2014","true","5.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Every time I tried a new one, I was provided with little to no direction in the way of tutorials and felt very lost in the game. I found this one on sale and picked it up. I played through the three tutorials and they explained the game in very good detail. The game runs really well on both my desktop and laptop, with compatibility settings for Windows 98/ME. The graphics are simple enough that it runs well on older PCs.\n\nI am thoroughly enjoying this game. It is easy to grasp and a lot of fun with endless replay value. I am sure that it is not one of the "top" RTS titles out there, but for its simplicity and tutorials I am very happy with it.

You can decide between two different modes: The (in my opinion) better mode is to conquer whole europe, the second mode is to get as many points as possible until  the year 1800 (not sure if really 1800 or some other year). You can decide between 5 different countries: Prussia, Great Britain, France, Russia and Austria. Every country has it's pros and cons. For example: Great Britain is an island so you have to build ships to get your troops to another country or Russia has many forests so it's easy to get some wood to build hospitals, barracks etc.\nAnother cool thing about this game is the Sympathy-system: If you attack another country without declaring war, teh other countries will then start to hate you, but if you declare war with a country, they will "forgive" you (except the country you're attacking of course :P).\nSo that was a short review about this game. Imperial Glory has many more features which i can't list in this review because it then will get about 5 pages long.\nI hope thsi review was helpful for you!\nP.S: I forgot to mention something: When you're getting to the end of the game, meaning the stage when you have conquered nearly every country, the game wil start crashing when you have finished a real-time battle. it can only be "fixed" if you let the computer fight against the invading country. It will not get fixed, but then you can fight about 3 battles without crashing, but then it will keep crashing again and you have to let the computer fight. Eidos published a Patch 8 years ago, but it doesn't do anything.\nThat's really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and I only bought IG on Steam because i hoped that the Steamversion is a fixed version.\nBut hey: the way to the bug is really fun :)","April 14, 2014","true","12.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Wasn't expecting too much, except a few hours of distraction for this reviewer (who is a big fan of the Total War series). The AI is pretty limited and the battles didn't provide any real opportunity for the use of tactics. In fact, it was really just a slug-out between both sides with success down to the quality of your troops, as opposed to the use of terrain or manoeuvres. My biggest gripe is that after fighting for control of a faction's capital the game always - and I mean, always - crashed. This became very frustrating because even when I knew I could win control I would have to leave it to autoresolve to decide the outcome. The decision would usually go against me. It got to the point where rather than fight any battles, I autoresolved about 80-90% of matches rather than waste half an hour of fighting only for the game to crash on the end battle save. I eventually completed the game but it felt like a hollow victory. So, OK for 97p, I guess, but there are better (if more expensive) ways of spending gaming time.","August 1, 2015","false","37.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

So, here it goes again.\n\n\nAlot of people say Imperial Glory is alot like Empire: Total War, or Napoleon: Total War, and let me start off by saying it is NOTHING like the two of them. Matter of fact, it's way worse then them.\n\n\nI'm going to split this off to diffrent sections. Due to I have alot to cover.\n\n\nGameplay/Timeline: Imperial Glory takes place in, before, during, and after the Napoleonic Wars era in Europe, and Northern Africa. There are tons of nations/factions in the game, such as the German States, the main coalition nations, such as Austria, Prussia, The United Kingdom, and Russia. The game features an awesome variety of nations, such as The Ottoman Empire, to Poland, to Egypt, hell, even to Morocco! But. There are only 5 nations playable. Yep. 5. Out of tons on the campaign map. France, Prussia, Russia, The United Kingdom, and Austria. This game is not one at all for variety. Every nation has amsot the exact same units. Two Skirm units, Three Line Infantry units, 5 Cavalry units, and I think 6 Artillery units. These conclude of the basic Horse Howitzer/Cannon, to normal cannon/howitzer, including Rockets. And Cavalry, Hussars, Lancer, And heavy cavalry units. The gameplay in IG can be really cool, or really bad. Buildings, and other cover areas are just straight up BS and OP. If you put a unit in a building, they will never die from fire, one guy infront will keep getting killed, over, and over again. Not anybody in the main building, while you can slaughter the opposing unit. This is a major problem in the campaign, which I wll get onto in the next section. Anyway, the combat is awesome if you get to go head-to-head. Your units fire in volleys, that don't take long to prepare, but to fire. Loading in this game is really fast. Matter of fact, a bit too fast. Rather then in NTW or ETW, they don't ram the ball 20 times in the barrel, but only about 3 or, 4, then, they take aim. And aim, and aim, and aim, and aim, and then fire. Whilst being annihilated in the proccess. It looks awesome, but it dosen't work at all. Your units may be able to fire a max of 2, 3 volleys in out-numbered. Also, they never aim where they're firing, this can be a problem with cav. One time, a group of lancers was charging head on to my Fusiliers, so, they aimed at the cav, I thought, "Good, they'll get wrecked!" I look back 30 seconds later, completley annihilated. It turns out they were firing at a unit that was to the LEFT of the cav. GG, G ♥♥♥♥ing G. Artillery is useless as-well. The cannon balls neven bounce. They will like, once and stop.. It's really annoying when you have to line a cannon next to fusilers, to do any damage. The cav also is OP as hell. They can decimate 4 units with 2 cav units within seconds. No chance to react, or anything. The melee on here is also awful. The animations are awesome, but, you can;'t run from melee! It's pretty much suicide, melee charging. Also, on a micselanious note, why does every guard unit look like the French Old Greneadier guard?\n\n\nCampaign: Oh boy, if this game was a peice of ♥♥♥♥, the campaign would be the dihoreah filling on top. This game has an AWFUL campaign. With only 5 facion playability, you'll get bored really fast.if you're not into the nations. And, the things that ruin the most are faction dimplomacy, and battle AI. If you dare declare war on the smallest of nations, it will cause a WW1. Nations will flip out, and send massive armies to you. I invaded Morocco, and literaly, every nation but 3 declared war on me. OVER MOROCCO. Do you think WW2 Started because Italy invaded Etiopia? NO. Because people wouldn't risk their country over a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ african province, would they? And, if anybody declares war on you, people do ♥♥♥♥ all. Batavia was my ally, and Spain invaded, so you know what they did? Declared war on me. MY ALLY BETRAYED ME THAT I HELPED BEFORE. And, anytime you engage in a battle, the ♥♥♥♥ing AI hides in a house/farm, and refuses to move. Dosen't matter if you're attacking, defending, or both. You're in for a loooooooooong game.\n\n\n\nMeh. That's about it, nothing much else in the game. Maps are awful, graphics are too, Even for a 2005 game. 2001 Games have better graphics. But I don't care about that. Meh.\n\n\nFinal Verdict, for Imperial Glory is a 3/10. Awful game. But, still can be fun I guess","May 10, 2014","false","4.0"," 16 of 37 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","16","37","0","1"

Tried one battle and knew this was a waste of time, money, space and memory. This game follows the same game play style as Empires: Total War, but Empires is like, 100 times better, maybe a 1000 times better. Let me re-enact a battle in words so you get to see all the problems with it:\n\nI choose to be Prussia against Austria. On a quick battle, it automatically brings up a castle in England. But you can select where you fight. Not wanting to fight in England, I choose some field(I forget the exact name.) It has some hills, mostly plain, with some lonely farm house on a hill. Also has a creek. My general begins rallying the men to fight valiantly and send the enemy running.\n\nI setup my troops behind the creek, daring the enemy to come across the creek, while also giving my cannons extra protection, knowing they have long and short range abilities. I setup my infantry and calvary in strategic positions. "Ah ha" I think "I have the best advantage on the battle field"\n\nSo the battle begins, and I have my cannons start firing on the advancing enemy....until I realize my cannons aren't firing cause they aren't in range of the enemy. So I move my cannons away from there nice, strategic positions, and start firing on the enemy advance, until I realize Im not hitting anything, except the ground to the side of the enemy advance.\n\nMeantime, I begin getting my calvary and infantry ready to engage the enemy, Austria. Now, in war games Ive played with calvary and infantry, its ALWAYS the calvary being the tougher, harder, more armoured units. They take more punishment in battle, the infantry lesser. Thats cause the horse makes them stronger. Even in history. Read about historical wars. Calvary units were tough, armoured, and designed to wreck havoc on the enemy. Thats why I like to mix in calvary.\n\nSo, when my calvary and infantry meets Austria's calvary and some infantry, both sides immediately lose soldiers, at a very rapid rate.\n\nMeantime, most of Austria's infantry is coming towards my cannons, who, despite the infantry charging closer, and directly in its line of fire, is hitting the enemy troops 1 out of every4 shots, or so.\n\nTo skip ahead, my loss's are so heavy at an alarming rate, Im sending all my units that are my "reserves" for later in the battle just to ensure Im winning! All the while, trying to keep some units to protect my pretty much useless cannons, hoping though that my cannons could cause some damage later on.\n\nMeantime, my cannon units have left the cannons to duel it out with there swords.\n\nFurther east down the creek, my troops have won the battle there, with like 1 or 2 units left to defeat. Sadly, I have a ragtag group left of what was an impressive group of units.\n\nMy cannon guys defeat the enemy troops there and can once again fire the cannons.\n\nTo skip to the end, I win the battle, losing an outrageous amount of troops, my cannons couldn't hit the broadside of a barn, the Ai, march's there entire army, trying to outflank you. Unless they're defending a castle or fortress. Oh, and on the main menu, its dated a 2005 game. Yes, you saw right. 2005. It'll be 10 years old next year. In 10 years, alot happened, including better games coming out. I'd recommend Empires Total War over this game. Empires has similar gameplay, more factions, and more realistic cannons, battles, sound effects, everything. If your new to RTS games, or looking to get into them, you may like this game as a starting place to learn, but I'd recommend Age of Empires 2 for that. If your a RTS veteran or looking for a new game, I'd like to stick a big sign up now that says, BUYER BEWARE","June 20, 2014","false","1.7"," 6 of 17 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","6","17","0","6"

Try as hard as you can by land and sea to take the world for yourself using modern wit and Industrial Age military hardware in an effort to survive and re-write history one invasion at a time. You'll find a vast research-tree and diverse array of units from basic people/militia to advanced warriors that cost an arm and a leg and take a few turns and fortunes to make... but there are something like 12 turns in a year so your biggest gear-grinder will be developing the income for those expansionist ambitions of yours. You are not the only one with big dreams on the map by far though. The AI will generally do its best to rip you a new one, which maximizes replayability from the very beginning.\n\nGLITCH WARNING:\nI did experience one glitch. I call it the post-battle crash glitch. You can resolve this by selecting "run in compatibility mode" in a setting screen pertaining to the game file either in "C" drive or in the "properties" menu. After selecting Compatibilty Mode I've had zero crashes and can actually enjoy the game now.","February 23, 2015","true","51.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And for the most part, that is sadly true. There isn't as wide a selection of tactical options, the units of different nations are all reskinned and renamed versions of each other, and the graphics are not nearly as good. Artillery shoots through your own ranks if you can't get it on high ground, which is usually impossible, and you can't even group your units. Despite these many and serious flaws, Imperial Glory does have a few redeeming qualities. It's low graphic requirements mean it can run on old or non-gaming systems. Empire is so poorly optimized that even new rigs often can't run it well. Imperial Glory is also cheaper. The campaign map, which uses figurines to represent armies on a paper map that looks like it is from the time period and sitting on the desk of you, the general, is a great touch. Battle can be grand in appearance and tense, if you don't mind the lack of ability to use artillery. Overall, I would only recommend this game to someone with particular imterest in late 18th to early 19th century warfare, and who can't run Empire: Total War.","March 6, 2015","false","17.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However in contrast the way the AI reacts to all the events is so astounding it had me sweating and rethinking alot of strategies. It was fun to actually find a game where diplomacy and trading could play such a larger role in you wining battles in the future. For insance, i was playing as france, and england and austria where slowly overtaking my claim to batavia and hanover, 2 of the most strategic gateways into france. Having sighted a military option initially taking over spain and portugual, i realised by now my armies where exhausted and thus austria and england pounced, having my armies streched thin\n\nThis is where the game truely took form on the battlefield games, having set maps for each region, tatical plays and strategic desions intertwined perfectly. Battlefields where so much fun with better formationing than empire and better unit balancing rather than throw a massive jumble of pointless troops in the mix, the game never ended up as a giant cluster♥♥♥♥ battle like all my empire games do\n\nShip battles felt more like duels rather than big worm fights as most historical ship battles took place, having manoevering tatics more and more decisive overall\n\n10/10 reconmend\n\nsry for any spelling or grammar errors :)","March 15","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hotax/recommended/277450/","hotax","WTF 3 finals 1 day PogChamp","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hotax/","732 products in account","In today's grand strategy market, Imperial Glory is basically just a poor man's Empire/Napoleon Total War. However, when this game originally came out in 2005, those games didn't exist. At the time Imperial Glory was a pretty good grand strategy game set in Europe and northern Africa from the last 1700s to the early 1800s. Even today that is mostly true. Imperial Glory does suffer from some compatibility problems with newer operating systems, but for me those were all fixed by running the game in compatibility mode for Windows XP SP3.\n\nGraphically the game does definitely look dated. That being said, that doesnt stop the real time battles from still being large impressive set pieces. The turn based campaign map lacks the realistic birds eye view from the newer Total War games but it still depicts the game world pretty well in my opinion. The player gets a "Risk" like map that looks like a real general's map in some army camp with little board game pieces to represent armies and navies (yes there is also naval warfare).\n\nGameplay should be very similar to those familiar with Total War games. It consists of playing as either Russia, Prussia, the UK, France, or Austria in a massive campaign to take over all of Europe. There are also smaller NPC empires such as Spain and the Ottoman Empire. The UI has aged well over the years. Though it might seem daunting, the game is actually quite simple and the tutorial teaches almost all that is required. This game is no Europa Universalis or Crusader Kings.\n\nThe real time battles are also basically what you would expect from a grand strategy game. It plays almost the same as a Total War game except for one huge missing factor which will turn off some players. For some reason Pyro Studios never thought that it was a good idea to include a unit morale system. Thus your units feel more like automatons than actual human beings. They will literally fight to the death when outnumbered 20 to 1.\n\nThere are also historical battles which follow the conquests and defeat of Napoleon and multiplayer/bot skirmishs.\n\nSo in conclusion, this is a game I recommend to anyone interested in a poor man's Total War game that has a somewhat humble presentation, yet does not have any game breaking bugs *cough* Rome 2 *cough*.\n\nLastly I love the soundtrack","May 1","true","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
