Have played both Mincraft and TF2 for 1000's of hours and this combines the two in the best way possible. Takes a little time to learn how to defend your base in the most effective way.

First of Let me say that this is far from an Ace Of Spades rip of or fancy reskin. Anyone who plays for a decent amount of time will be able to confirm that.\nBlock N load is all about team work, and preperation, But it also features fast paced combat requireng strategy and planing inorder to achive victory over your opponents. The team that wins will be the team that works together, plans together and  adapts to the enemys movements.\n\nBlock N Load is unique in that before combat begins, both teams get time to build defences to protect there objective. Building walls, radars, traps, turrets and the like can all help defend your precious base. Working togetehr is key to build an epic defence that will have your enemies stuck at the front door. Failure to build an effective defence will alow your foes to walk all over you. By doing this the game forces you to think carefully and be a bit creative in how you plan your defence. Its up to you to find a way to defend it as long as posible to give your team more time to attack.\n\nOnce the batle begins things heat up quickly. Battles can be fast paced and frantic and require quick thinking inorder to out wit your opponetns. Getting the high ground and working as a team to flank enemies is highly effective and landing a killing blow feels awesome and satisfying.\n\nAttacking the opponents base can offten be tricky and some times rather challenging. Especialy if its well fortified, yet there is a huge sense of Acheivment when you are able to open it up and watch it come crashing down. Blowing up a defensive line with a well placed bomb or mortar fells great and satisfying. I even caught myself shouting "KABOOOM!" (Ive been plaing lots of Demoman on TF2 latley, sue me) once when a well placed bomb of mine took out there wall along with 2 of there turrets and health and ammo staions, allowing my team to charge in and take out the remaing defences before going for the objective.\nWinning a match feels SO good and the satisfying sound of the enemy base exploding just puts the cherry on top.\n\nThere are several diffrent characters to try and all of them have strengths and weaknesses. A good team will have a mix that alows for both good defence and offence. A team that neglects one or the other can still win, but chances are they may strugle if they do not plan out their strategy well. Each character feels useful and unique and each plays in very diffrent ways. This alows for players to experiment and find characters and strategies that match there preferd play style or to branch out and try new and diffrent tactics that they would normaly avoid otherwise. At the moment there are 6 playable characters but there are more on the way and hopefully this will lead to new and exciting ways to play.\n\nWhile I have done nothing but praise the game so far there are a few issues that have disapointed me duing my 100+ hours of gameplay. The controls do feel a ♥♥♥♥♥ chunky at times and the jump mechanics do take a fair bit of getting used to, especialy if your used to playing games like TF2. Do not be suprised if you find yourself acidently jumping off a leadge to your death. There are also a few anoying bugs that still remain unfixed despite the game being out of beta, thankfully none of them truly ruin the game and they sould hopefully be on their way out soon.\n\nIt should also be mentioned that new players will most liekly strugle at first as they try and learn what works and what dose not work, when it come to attacking and defending.\n\nOverall this is a really fun game that alows for good team based combat and strategy. Players who like to rely on there brains as much as there skill will probably have a lot of fun at this. Just be sure to give the game a chance and you will most likely enjoy it.\n\nI Highly recomend you give this game a shot. Its fun, its clever, its well balanced, its action packed, and its highly enjoyable.\n\nGet in there and have some fun.\n(What the Block you gona do?)","May 4, 2015","true","177.6"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","13","19","2","0"

Once you've learnt a class you begin to feel like a master with them, knowing how and when to use your guns/abilities. Each class has their own blocks and special block to use, these give them an edge in battle whether it be defensive, offensive or supportive.\n\nEach class (some more than others) takes time to master, I really enjoy this side of gameplay due to it's rewarding nature of bonuses at level ups and new skins (as well as being able to destroy your opponents).\n\nMatches and Maps\n\nThere is a happy pool of maps to play on and you are given a choice between 2 when you join a lobby. Each map is unique and takes time to learn. As said for the classes, new maps are also being added.\n\nA slight negative is the regional servers; with the EU server I have been experiencing lag and not even being able to get into games, because of this I've had to play on NA servers despite the high ping.\n\nGameplay\n\nOverall it is very smooth, the movement is simple and enjoyable because of the rate at which you scale the maps, when learning this can be annoying at times (sprinting and jumping at someone and then flying over the edge of the map) but you'll soon pick it up. The gun play is great, each unique with different ranges and block damage.\n\nThis leads me onto the building/destroying side of things; the fact I would enjoy this game if the maps weren't interactable has to say something (a good something) about the gameplay, but being able to do this adds an unimaginable amount of creativity.\n\nSummary\n\nTo conclude; Block N Load has been a breath of fresh air for me in the FPS genre, it's large range of potential for future competitive play and continous updates makes me really want to stick around and see how everything turns out.\n\nMy final opinion on whether you should buy this game is: Yes, and if you used to play Minecraft and TF2: Hell yeah.\n\nNegative reviews...\n\nPlease take into account when reading the negative reviews the hours of game time and when they were posted. In most cases the player has very little time played or the review was made when the game was in beta. To be frank, I believe this game deserves at least a "very positive" review status.","May 10, 2015","true","34.4"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","13","19","0","0"

Support characters. Attack Charaters. Defense Characters.\n\n\nHonestly, this game is much better than people let on.\n\n8.6/10\n\n\nRECENT UPDATE:\nThe game has been updated to be free to play. I also have like 100 more hours under my belt. Here is more review info.\n\nYou can play as the heroes in the free rotation, but once they leave the free rotation, you have to buy them with either A) gold, or B) platinum. Platinum can be bought with real life money, and gold is gotten in game. BUT! BUT BUT BUT! It isn't pay to win. Characters are just that, characters. No characters are better than others, they all excel in different situations.\n\nThen there are perks. Perks can ONLY be bought with gold. Perks upgrade characters (they have downsides too tho) and give them better offensive, defensive, and hero roles. AKA: if you're good at this game, you get better.\n\nThis also brings a lot more uniqueness into the game.\n\nEXAMPLE: Just because someone is Nigel (the sniper) doesn't mean you'll know how to counter him  right away. He could have a gun damage upgrade or a fall damage upgrade.\n\nIn the game are skins, to add even MORE variation to your choices. Skins can only be bought with platinum, but holy crap they look good. Devs did a good job on them.\n\nAlso, if you bought the game when it was p2p (like me) you got a bunch of skins free and all the starter heroes unlocked.\n\nThis game is a few skins, a new gamemode, and a new hero away from being the best multiplayer teamwork-oriented fps game out there.\n\nI have re-earned my faith in JagEX.\n\n8.9/10\n\nI realize now I'm being way too "HOLY ♥♥♥♥ THIS GAME IS GOD" so I'll list some cons as well.\n\nPROS AND CONS:\nPros:\n\n+most characters feel balanced, and all have great skill ceilings.\n+most maps are great, and it's rare for me to say "not this map again" when playing\n+I have a bad computer, and the game runs well at low settings. You HD 50 gb ram PC master race people will love that.\n+game is constantly being updated with new heroes and skins, as well as bug fixes\n+daily challenges add an extra goal to gameplay and gold earning.\n+very high character customization. First you pick a hero, then perks, then blocks, then skins. Every hero can feel different with different setups\n+devs are actually listening to the community\n+large userbase, not too long of a wait when joining games.\n+all guns feel different and fun\n\n\nCons:\n\n-now that the game is f2p, heroes aren't free. You have to pay gold, which is earned through playing games, to buy characters. This is ok, but the problem is that new players will always be the same characters.\n-A few characters need nerfs and buffs.\n-ranking system is completely broken. You get placed with noobs even at gold rank. They should fix this.\n-some maps are badly designed, in my opinion. Like "Block". "Block" is a multicolored map where being a skill character is necessary to win, really.\n-cubes can be damaged by stuff that isn't your tool (guns, explosives), but devs said they'd patch this. Will remove this once fixed.\n-lower ranked players are toxic, and immature.","May 4, 2015","true","176.9"," 599 of 668 people (90%) found this review helpful 129 people found this review funny","90","599","668","129","12"

If I had to compare Block N Load to another game, it would be kind of a mix between DOTA/LEAGUE with Team Fortress 2 characters, and the freedom of Minecraft all mixed into one.\n\nThe battle maps in this game are very diverse; there are multiple playstyles you have to incorperate into playing each map. By allowing contant map rotations, it is a very refreshing game that has lots of replay value.\nThe characters in this game are simply amazing. Each character has their own unique set of tools for the job. Each one is valued in its own way. I've found that playing with a team with everyone having completely different characters, are the games that win the most.\n\nCONS:\n- BALANCING    While there are many different types of characters to choose from, only a select few are currently viable. Engineers are almost essential to a win, while playing the Sniper class proves to extremely hard to win with. There are Cogswheels in almost every game because of how strong they are. I would love to see more balancing of characters in order to give more streamline gameplay.\n\n-- RANKING SYSTEM     Block N Load has a ranking system. However the problem with this system is that it is completely one-sided. A player can only progress forward in terms of rank, and never drop ranks. To put simply, the ranking that a player has simply reflects the amount of time they've put into the game; not actually their skill level.\nI would love to see a ranking system with both ups and downs in order to have more of a competitive environment.\n\nOverall Block N Load is am amazing game worthy to pick up and try. There are only minor issues, but I'm sure those will get sorted out with time.

This means I have a larger knowledge of the game and it's issues than most reviewers, but I possibly also have a more mild opinion on how serious an issue is\n\nSo what is Block'n'Load? It can be described as a combination of TF2 and Minecraft combat combined with parts from LoL.\nIt can also be described as a rethought spiritual successor to AoS, and the first great creative shooter.\nFinally, it can also simply be put as possibly the most tactical FPS to date.\n\nThe issues I have seen quite a few reviews by peoples who haven't really played the game, and I'm going to start by clearing up some of them:\n\nThe controls are clunky\nAs a part of implementing a building aspect, the controls are slightly different from a normal shooter and generally, the entire game has a somewhat steep learning curve because it is very different. This is not necessarily a bad thing, it took me about 5-10 matches to adapt to the controls, and both the official tutorials as well as the steam guides written by the community gives you a good insight into the game.\nSimply: It takes slightly longer to learn, which some free weekenders are crying about.\n\nIt's too expensive! It should be F2P!\nNo. First of all we did ask for them to lower the price in the beta:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/299360/discussions/0/620703493333496110/\nAnd they did lower it:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/299360/discussions/0/620712364037811307/\nThey seemingly lowered the price of the game based on player feedback. Kudos to them! Now about the game being F2P? Just pay the price already. Here are a great thread about why it should not be F2P:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/299360/discussions/0/620712364038776156/\n\nThe argument for F2P is that we get more players. That is the only argument besides greed from players, which doesn't count. Also, amongst the extra players will be a lot of griefers, trolls and new players who haven't gotten into the game, which is indeed an issue as shown above. The free weekend showed this, and no current players want F2P because it straight out makes the community worse.\n\nJagex\nYeah, that is apparently an issue. You simply see players of previous titles, especially AoS, who come and simply haunt Jagex by disliking the game without giving it a shot. Have Jagex actually improved this time? The game is great, the CM's, map creators and developers play from time to time and they are great and fun peoples.\n\nSo give them a chance, the game really deserves it\n\nIt is slow\nThat is another aspect of the building. For building to be of use, the characters move slightly slower than most shooters and all of them have a ton more hp than usual. Again, this both a pro and a con. It allows for a lot more tactics and strategy, and getting the jump on someone or a lucky shot does not mean an instakill. A headshot from the sniper class deals 60 damage, where most heroes have 100 hp. It also prolongs fights, which actually grants a lot more action at a time. Still, if you want more mindless twitchy shooters that have been around for ages, wait and then buy the new map pack and graphics overhaul of CoD when it comes.\n\nIt is tactical\nWhich means that you need to rely on teamwork, and can't have peoples fooling about. This makes you very reliant on random teammates, and like other games, this can cause frustration. Be aware that you will rarely be able to carry an entire team here, and that it is possibly best played with two or more friends.\n\nThe introduction of ranked should largely separate the more hardcore players from the casual ones, but be warned that this is not a game that is casual. You have to focus and pay attention, and it is not something that you can relax while doing. Again, this is a pro and con, and it is up to you if it is for you or not. There has been speculation on a more casual and chaotic gamemode, but it will problary not come too soon.\n\nYour pretty base won't last\nDespite being a creative minecraft-like shooter, do not expect to be building pretty castles. This is what AoS really were criticised for, making the building element very chaotic and not being able to create anything pretty because it was blown up in seconds. In a fashion, this is the same. You can be creative with your base, but in a cold-blood tactical way and not aesthetically. Even if it doesn't get blown up, the game usually doesn't last more than 1 hour, and then it is also gone for good.\n\nA map creator might be made though, so then you can create pretty things, save them, and then blow them up repeatedly\n\nOnly one gamemode\nThere is only one gamemode as of yet, and while it is a good gamemode it can get slightly monotone. They plan to introduce more gamemodes in the future, though.\n\nDoesn't run on a potato\nWhile it isn't badly optimized, the requirements sort of resemble those for AAA titles. Why? Same reason you can't just set off 100 nukes in Minecraft, there are just a ton of block updates, and here you have a server running 10 players who are using explosives while also having something that needs to accurately calculate bullets and plenty of other things. Graphics are also noticeably better, which also bumps the requirements a bit.\n\nIn short, if your computer is half a decade old, don't expect it to run well, even if it is a voxel shooter.\n\nThe strong sides\n"No game is the same"\nThe creative aspects allow for an extreme amount of tactics. There are not only a couple camper spots on a map, you can poke a hole in a wall and shoot from there, so you have to constantly improvise and you will never be able to master the game. This is the aspect of the focus point "No game is the same", and while it might not be entirely true, it is more true than any other FPS.\n\nYou don't really need to be a good shot\nFor a lot of the guns you don't need a super aim, and playing the game tactically is much more important. An example is from the reveal at Insomnia, where a team of LoL players beat a team of BF players.\n\nCommunity is good so far\nWhile there are a lot of rookies who wander a bit about trying things out atm because it is launch, the community is pretty good. Other than that there are several bands of veterans from the beta who team up in 5 man groups, and while playing with competent friends is fun, this can cause some very uneven games. But otherwise the game has seen few griefers, trolls and teamkillers.\nThe core of the community gathers on the official livestream (Twitch.tv/blocknload or hitbox.tv/blocknload) and you should be able to find friendly players to play with and veterans who will give you advice there or on the forum.\n\nBalance is good\nIt is always up in the air for discussion and there are several threads on the forums discussing it at all times, but the developers have been balancing things well so far, and while it will never be perfect, it is good so far.\n\nGraphics are good enough\nI didn't like them at first either, but after a couple games? They are good enough. It's some mix of Minecraft pixels style and the TF2 cartoon style and it works well to both provide good performance while not looking horrible.\n\n\nFinal Score So you want a number to use to compare it to other games? How about I just paint it out directly?\n\nThe game is in my opinion the best shooter to date because of the building aspect, which is implemented so well and allows for so many tactics, a much more varied gameplay and that you constantly have to improvise.\n\nIf you play FPS, Minecraft(or alike), Moba or RTS I would recommend you to try it. Otherwise not, because the game introduces you to a lot of unknowns, and its best to have some experience from either of those genres.","May 6, 2015","true","103.7"," 252 of 315 people (80%) found this review helpful 31 people found this review funny","80","252","315","31","17"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WildRandomIdiot/recommended/299360/","WildRandomIdiot","Aviansie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WildRandomIdiot/","69 products in account","Well, I've never written a full-blown Steam review for any game, ever. Even if it's really good or really bad, I don't normally have the motivation to do so. That changed when I started playing Block N Load.\n\nIt's a spiritual successor to Ace of Spades, which was bought and remade by Jagex. Unfortunately, that alone would turn quite a few people away, because Ace of Spades didn't fare very well. However, almost all of the problems people had with Ace of Spades have been fixed up here.\n\nThe game is relatively simple: You get to pick between six classes (more will be coming in the future), including an insane scientist, an evil robot, and a Mexican ninja. Games are two teams of 5 versus 5, where you have about six minutes to build defenses and traps to protect these large machines called cubes and your team's base, then when time's up, the game starts and you can raid your opponents.\n\nThere are tons of different blocks that do different things. For example, my personal favorite is the fake block: It looks exactly like a connecting block, but when the opponent steps on it, it breaks away and he or she falls hopelessly into your trap, which could be bear traps, caltrops, sentry guns, poisoned dart-shooting tiki heads, or you could even make them fall off the map entirely. Another block is the Force Gate: You and your teammates can walk through it like there was nothing there, but your opponents cannot; they'll have to go around or destroy it. The variety of different blocks allow you to attempt to set up an impenetrable defense (although NOTHING is truly impenetrable!)\n\nThe strategies required in this game are far deeper than you might expect. Just throwing bear traps everywhere won't cut it. You need to think about where your attackers might approach or where to place radars and respawn pads. Since nearly everything in this game can be destroyed (including all the blocks and items you can place), you have to hide them away where the enemy can't find them. In addition, occasionally a powerful weapon called the Blockbuster will be sent in, giving you shielding and increased cube/base damage for two minutes... unless your enemy gets it first! Because the Blockbuster is only given to the team that can get it first, it becomes a frantic race to the center of the arena to grab this powerful item.\n\nSo, what are you waiting for, Blockhead? Come on and give it a go!\n\nBy the way, a tip for new players: Although it seems like a good idea, do NOT cover the cubes/bases with blocks. Trust me on this. You'll just end up giving any attackers free cover.","May 9, 2015","true","697.7"," 102 of 124 people (82%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","82","102","124","13","4"

It makes you work with your team and the way you play is determined by the character you picked. Every character is well balanced. You get supplies by breaking blocks, the longer it takes to break the more supplies you get. Also I found the maps to be so fun and beautiful. Over all I really like this game it’s so much fun, but it’s not perfect.\n\nCons:\nThe flaws are that if you are new you may find it hard to go against those that have played longer. This could be that they are better, but most likely it’s because the games leveling up system is broken. If the person played longer than you did with a character, their character gets to wait less to reuse their ability “F key” than you along with other benefits. Also if you’re looking for a match and find one, but it’s already in progress three things could happen.\n1.)	You join and see that the game barley started and have fun.\n2.)	You join and see that you are about to lose.\n3.)	 You don’t join and may get penalized from playing for some time.\nYep, the game will penalize you for not joining a game which most likely is about to end. Also when the games over you have to leave back to the main menu in order to look for another match. So, this means if you had a close game and wish to have a rematch, will too bad you can’t.\n\nThe game requires to be very tactical and work as a team. Also on average a game may last you 20-35 minutes so make sure you have time to play and have some fun.

All gameplay elements are well balanced, and tie together incredibly well. In the context of pure gameplay, there is little you can say against it. It is the best game I've ever played, and that likely won't change for a long time, I'm certainly a candidate for being the #1 fan.\n\nCurrently the biggest problem is the playerbase. It is quite low, and slowly diminishing. I'm sure the developers will be looking at ways to pick this back up. If you'd use a USA, or UK server, you shall be okay, but otherwise I'd suggest not purchasing the game. Queues may take a little longer than other games due to the low playerbase. However, if you're in a long queue, please do not leave, it creates a perpetuating issue that is only solved by players being patient.\n\nThe game handles high ping as well as it can with client side hit detection, however it heavily affects other elements of the game. Anything above ~150 and you likely won't enjoy the game to it's full extent.\n\nThe community has a whole is a pretty positive one. There will of course be those who aren't, but they are a minority. Please try to encourage this trend if you play. You can also find many discussions on the forum to openly speak about the game with other players.\n\nIf you find yourself being beaten by experienced teams constantly, please do not give up the game. Instead, try and improve, or wait before queuing to try fight another team. It is a problem, but one that is not currently solved. Just try enjoy the game regardless.\n\nThe game is essentially free of any game ruining bugs. There is quite a lot of bugs, however you will experience almost none of them during regular gameplay and they have little to no effect. These bugs will be fixed eventually. Do not consider this an issue.\n\nCheaters/Hackers are not an issue. You'll see the occasional one, however they'll be banned, and the game is VAC enabled. Don't expect them to ruin your overall gameplay experience.\n\nThe development team historically was quite responsive to players, however this has lately diminished, but this shouldn't deter you from the game. They also do regular live streams on Twtich and Hitbox.\n\nYou should try out the demo that is available, it lasts forever, and gives you three characters to play. All characters are balanced, and the game is not pay to win in anyway. You can fully enjoy the demo, though I encourage you to purchase the game if you enjoy it.","July 16, 2015","true","500.3"," 40 of 52 people (77%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","77","40","52","5","4"

You can pick up this game for free at the official block n load website, so price complaints shouldnt matter at the minute. This game, despite the fact that its blocked based and an FPS, its almost completely different. The game feels a lot like a moba, but it isnt, so dont let that statement turn you off. you must defend from 1 to 3 bases depending on the map, like tf2 control points except you cant camp back. You must destroy the all the enemies bases to win, and there is five minutes at the start to build your defences. This game allows for a lot of creativity and is pretty good when you get down to it. Jagex have learned from thier mistakes as they just recently made an update that fixed almost all problems i had through character balancing and bug fixes. This is a brilliant game, but sadly i also do not approve of the price for this title.

So read some reviews and most aren't complete enough to be fair. So here it is a honost review:\n1. It's a free game so you can't complain a lot about it.\n2. Its is fun. The quality of this game is high especially considering it is free.\n3. Unlike what most people say, it is not pay to win. I never payed a dime, got all the heroes. You will earn a lot of money, but you got to play to earn it. Some heroes are cheap some are more expensive.\n4. There is no best hero. It is more important how you play with you hero. This game is not a FPS where you goal is to kill as many players as you can. You need to be smart. Every hero has a weakness and a strentgh. It will take a few hours to find them. So once again, you just need to play. When a hero is to strong, the developers will make him weaker within weeks after release.\n5. Amount of players is a real problem. On average you need to wait 2min before every game. Not a huge problem, but you would think that given the quality and fun there aren't wait times.\n6. Great support! We get new heroes and updates all the time! In terms of support it is the same as ARK, so just awesome.\n7. I noticed that most players whom are complaining are actually the players who are just not that good. They fight hard but not smart. Like you will notice.\n8. Strong learning curve. The game is easy, but it will take some hours for beginners to understand it. After that, with every new hero you will need some hours to master his skills. This game does not only depends on skills but also tactics.\n9 One huge problem is that people will during the match. The problem is, when a player leaves there is no side effect for the other team. Meaning they got a extra guy. Also people will leave when your on the loosing side, while a game can change within seconds.\n\nConclusion: I think this is a must have game. It is fun, free and has great support. You would be stupid not to try it out. Is it perfect no... But how many EA games did you buy that last year that were unplayable, XD.","May 26","true","251.6"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","19","20","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VinceRowe/recommended/299360/","VinceRowe","Vince","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VinceRowe/","350 products in account","========================================\n\nVince Rowe ReviewsSaving the Industry one Game at a Time!\n\n[YouTube Link]   [Curation Link]\n\n========================================\n\n\n\n7/10 - subject to Beta.\n\nLet's get the main problem out of the way - it's made by Jagex.\n\nSo after their previous tripe of a game, an FPS voxel based shooter - Ace of Spades where they ruined a perfectly good game, they release this, an FPS voxel based shooter and surprisingly, it's actually quite good!\n\nSo let's start with the story, there isn't one - that's all.\n\nThe graphics are alright, they have a cartoon feel to them, vaguely reminds me of Team Fortress 2, but for some reason, my FPS goes to **** so I have to play in the lowest settings, not that actually matters to be honest, I kind of like the worst graphic settings, looks like Eldtrich.\nOverall, graphics are alright, nothing really in the "wow" factor, but it compliments the game none-the-less.\nOne big problem though, the view models are bloody huge! Seriously, they cover over 25% of the screen and there is no way to tone it down, it's distracting, annoying and insanely ugly - this needs fixing immediately.\n\nNow comes the gameplay right?\nWell, it's fun, but don't think Ace of Spades (The original free version which is now called Build'n'Shoot - see any similarities?) Because firstly, throw out the idea of twitch shooters, it's nothing like CS:GO or even the original Ace of Spades. The characters have a large amount of health, that or the weapons don't do enough damage... Overall, you aim to be keeping your cursor on someone for a good 5 seconds, the closest example I can think of would be Super Monday Night Combat. The guns are quite fun to use, there's a lot of diversity between the different classes and the weapons they possess, hitting someone with a shotgun point-blank takes off a good chunk of their health, and the health bar gives a nice amount of feedback to the player.\nThen comes the actual blocks and building, you get 5 minutes at the start of the round to beef out your base for the upcoming battle, I found the best strategy was to make your Generator/Core i.e. the goal as open as possible, it's insusceptible to ranged attacks and half the time someone tries to box themselves in with your Generator and it makes them impossible to kill while they whale on your base. With all that said, the blocks, sentries, destruction is in a very good position, somewhat similar to the old Ace of Spades game.\nSo now, it's the about the players. It's set to be a 5v5 battle, like your typical MOBA genre nowadays (I'm including CS:GO in this genre now), and it as a result it gives a really good balance between havoc and peace - me being the defender type of guy (With sentries and all), I like it, quite a lot and yet still allows for the execution of tactics, rewarding teamwork and a generally friendly atmosphere to the game.\n\nSound? Well, in all honesty... It's quite shoddy... In fact, seems to be inspired by the original Ace of Spades, perhaps even ripped from that game. I would like to see it have a little more work put into it mind you.\n\nAs for replay value, well, it's a lot like a CS:GO or League game, the bare essentials of each match are the exactly the same, but the way it plays out can be slightly different, there are a lot of tactics you can dish out against the enemy which does spice up the game a lot. Overall, there are a lot of maps, maps are extremely easy to create anyway (Hopefully they release some sort of public building tool if they haven't done already - TF2 it up or something), quite a lot different strategies you can put into play, and a few characters (Hopefully more to come though, I don't know what their say is on that) but yeah, it's got quite a decent amount of re-playability. However, for some reason, you only get the choice between 2 maps at a time, it doesn't give you all the maps to vote for... In addition, if they have no intention to introduce new characters then it will become stale quite fast, and in addition won't be able to suit all players and their personal play style.\n\nNow for my opinion, I think it's good, surprisingly good, I expected it to be a another pile of trash released by Fagex, but to my surprise it wasn't. I actually enjoy playing this game, it's fun with other people and feels quite competitive when it comes round to it. It can become tense at times, especially when you're the only one at base defending off their entire team.\nAs a whole: Yes, I would recommend this game, it's in Open Beta at the moment (At the time of this review), and it's free to download and try out, then it will be pay for when it's finally released. It's an Old Fashioned Beta where you give them feedback, without having to pay for the game in advance. If you're interested, get into the Beta (FREE), if you enjoy it - buy it and support the developers.\n\n\n7/10 - subject to Beta and any changes that take place from now until official release.\nAt least it isn't Ace of Spades.\n\n-Vince\n\n\nLink to my YouTube Channel.\nLink to my Twitter Page.\n{LINK REMOVED} Link to my Blog.\nLink to my Curations.","December 15, 2014","true","135.2"," 96 of 154 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","96","154","0","6"

Digging feels balanced, e.g. sneaky tunneling can be countered with radars, heavy defence with explosives and so on.\n\nPacing is medium to fast - feels more dynamic than, e.g. TF2 for me. Maps are not big, you can quickly get to fights, build respawn pads and respawn is quite short. Individual contribution to winning can be big and satisfying.\n\nThere's a room for mastering and skill - map control, shooting (headshots), movement (two-block-climb-jumping), deciding when to attack or defend. There is some depth and learning curve is gradual, you can start with just shooting and assaulting the front lines if building is too much for you from the start (tutorial shows just the very basics, unfortunately). The interface is intuitive and informative.\n\nCurrently ranked matchmaking (is there matchmaking at all?) is not available yet so you get very randomly skilled and behaving people (I haven't noticed any serious griefing yet though (EU server)).","May 2, 2015","true","63.4"," 40 of 57 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","40","57","3","0"

In my first review I had 244 hours total. Now I have 1,115 hours. Hopefully that shows how fun this game can be. But there are a ton of things both right and wrong with Block N Load. First of all The game has a horrible tutorial so don't even bother with it. The playerbase is usually helpful to new players but when players with over 1K hours keep getting games with new players they can become quite hostile. There are 4 regions to play on Oceania,Asia,Europe,and North America. The game has a bundle of fun mechanics and skins and perks and great voice lines and visuals. Now as before where I was very new to the game a lot of my attitude has changed but most still reamins the same. The game has potential. There are a lot of problems. But in my opinion the Fun Filled moments are worth most of the hard times. I've had more fun than ever possible playing this. I've also had the most frustrating times of my life in this. But i've also made friends that I absolutely Adore and Love to play with every day.

It’s an elegant genre blender of sorts which combines the sandbox building aspect of Minecraft with the team based first person shooting of Team Fortress 2. And while it has its setbacks, Block N Load is a clever Team based shooter which is sure to deliver at least of few hours of quality content.\n\nThe premise here is simple, each team has its own generator cube, which they have to protect while attempting to destroy the other teams. However it gets a lot more interesting than it sounds. At the start of each match the teams get five minutes to fortify their half of the map and build defences. After that time is up, the big force field at the centre of the map goes down and all hell breaks loose as the two teams attempt to attack each others base. The best thing about Block N Load is that there is no one single definitive way to play, in fact this is a game which rewards creativity and where no two games are quite the same. This is where the Minecraft aspect comes in. The entire map is fully destructible, allowing the teams great freedom of approach. For instance I learned early on that a frontal assault is rarely the best option, as the short ten second respawn timer makes it hard to push the enemy team away with brute force. Therefore what soon became one of my favourite strategies is simply digging a tunnel across the map and to the enemy base, and then destroying it from underneath. The same ingenuity applies to the defensive aspect of Block N Load. This can be anything from digging trenches to building walls to creating some highly elaborate traps. For example in one game I managed to dig a giant ditch next to our base, and put bear traps at the bottom. Afterwards I filled the top up with dummy blocks, which would collapse underneath anyone who steps on them, sending them falling to their death. And there really is a great sense of satisfaction that comes from building a defensive structure or trap, and then seeing your plan work out, as the enemy falls for the trick.\n\nThe base building aspect is certainly Block N Loads strongest quality, as it embraces creativity and rewards clever tactical decisions. That said, I would like to have seen more different blocks and materials in the game. There is a nice selection on offer here, with some blocks being specific to certain classes, but it would be quite nice to see a little more, as when selecting the materials I wanted to take into battle with me, there wasn’t really that much I had to leave out. It would be a lot more interesting if more blocks and material types were provided, as that would give the player much room for experimentation, therefore meaning a greater sense of replayability in the long run. Speaking of classes, there are six of them, and they each have their own unique weapons, abilities and materials. Jagex did a great job here in differentiating all the characters, and making all of them feel useful in their own right. For instance the medic, which is very much a support character, can heal friendly players and provide them with ammunition, while the big robot class can put down extra respawn points, something which can prove game changing if placed in the right location. There is a lot of emphasis on teamwork here, and a team which is working together is obviously more likely to end up victorious. That said, due to the small team sizes, five on each side, individual contributions can and do make a huge difference to the games outcome, making each player feel a lot more important in their own right. This does however carry a certain problem. Due to the importance of each player in the team, if one player leaves in the middle of the game, the enemy team will automatically have a huge advantage. And this does happen far more than I would like it to, partly due to the fact that block and loads matches are certainly not short, and can easily drag on for 30 minutes or more. As a result I feel that there should have been a system similar to Counter Strike Global Offensive, whereas players can punished for leaving mid way through a game. All Block N Load currently does is politely ask you to finish the game for the benefit of your team, but frankly that is not enough, and I would prefer model where you will be temporarily barred from playing if you abandon your team.\n\nBlock N Load is at its best when both teams are utilising all the tools at their disposal, and when everyone is using their brains to outsmart the enemy team, the game can prove to be extremely fascinating to play. Newtons third law applies fairly nicely here. "For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction”, and a good player is not only one which can employ good tactics on his own, but that can also predict the movements of the enemy team, and take appropriate measures to counter them. The actual first person shooting is however mediocre at best. It is helped by the fact that all classes have different weapons and abilities, however I would have liked to see more on the side weapon variety here. Each character has their own unique primary and secondary weapon, however that is it. What I would have like to see is maybe an extra few class specific weapons to be unlocked later on, something which would increase both the gameplay diversity when in combat, and the general sense of replayability. But Block N Load is indeed at its best when its played more like Minecraft and less like Call of Duty. I already mentioned that a frontal assault is perhaps one of the worst and least successful strategies to employ, and thats not helped by the mediocre FPS mechanics on offer here. Instead its the sandbox base building that carries that game, and provides it will a good sense of replayability, as no two games are really ever the same. One of the most fascinating parts of Block N Load is simply looking at the strategies which other players have come up with, and then replicating them at a later date. When going into the enemy base, I was always curious as to what sort of defences they managed to build in those first five minutes, which could be anything from turrets to minefields to elaborate networks of trenches. The replay value is also propped up by the different maps, of which there are currently five. The sandbox nature of the game means that each map comes with totally different strategies, both defensive and offensive. They all offer different possible routes, both above and under ground, rewarding those that are able to think outside the box.\n\nDespite its silly tone, Block N Load, is a clever team based shooter which rewards player creativity. It strikes a fine balance between uncontrolled sandbox chaos, and genuinely satisfying team based action. You can currently pick it up on Steam for 15 dollars or 11 pounds, and to be honest I think thats a reasonable price to ask for what you are getting, as at the very least Block N Load will provide you will a few hours of chaotic entertainment, while at best you might fall in love with its open ended sandbox nature. As a final verdict I would recommend Block N Load to FPS fans wanting something a little bit different.","May 6, 2015","true","5.6"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","18","21","2","0"

You also get a FREE COPY of Ace of Spades!\nIt's similar to AoS beta but feels more finished and it's still in beta ;)\nThe graphics are pretty decent, even in very low. (Specifications changed and now it's hard for me to run it ;-;)\n\nThe main game mode that exists for now is a sort of destroy the flag and it's pretty fun. There are a variety of classes and my favourite is the minigun guy. (Robot)\n\nAce of Spades failed a bit with its building, but this game makes sure you spend some time to build and create defences for your base. I doubt Jagex will make the same mistakes again! Also, people say other team mates don't work properly and mess around horribly, well, you can report them and perhaps kick(?) them, like you could in AoS.\n\nI'm not too sad I bought it because I can still run it pretty well on VERY LOW, however, it'll be great with a decent computer and not a laptop. If you really don't want to spend $15, you can wait for the basic version to release which will be around the same price, so may as well get it now! After all, a FREE copy of AoS :P\n\nHowever, always report team killers and sentry destroyers of your team and there are now speed hackers. While the dev team is trying hard to get rid of them, the easiest way is to report them, getting them stuck onto a 2 hour loading queue with other hacking noobs.\n\n[EDIT: Sorry, the AoS copy was only for Beta purchases. For $10, it's a good TF2-like game. Great updates and new characters still coming out so far out of release.]","December 16, 2014","true","163.6"," 51 of 80 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","51","80","0","1"

But is it any good?\n\nBefore you say anything like, "peoplz da spawnn camppd me" or "ozzer team 2 gud 4 me" or "team killz arez happeninz!", the game is in beta. The game is in BETA. So, things won't be perfect. There will be spawn campers. The ranking is unfair at this current time. People do occasionally team kill. It happens.\n\nThe main problem with the game is that nobody understands it's still in beta. The only reason it's out right now is because they need feedback from us, the players, to help them create a great game. They are not near completed yet. If you just give Jegex a chance, they'll finish the ranking system, where you can play ranked matches so you play against other people in your skill level. Give them support, don't hate because it's not there RIGHT NOW.\n\nAnother thing I see people complain about is the merit system. Whenever you team kill, blow up your team's base or just troll in general, nobody sees the troublemakers get in trouble, they just assume nothing happens and get mad. Oh boy, are they wrong. There is an entire team dedicated to stopping this kind of thing happening. And when it does happen, and the criminals get caught, there are punshments. Real ones.\n\nLast thing I wanted to talk about. The game's population. It may seem like a lot, but only after waiting for ten minutes do you get to actually play the game. Every game requires 10 people to start, and every one of them needs to be active to accept the rules when they join the game, or you must wait for LONGER, as the people who don't accept get kicked. Once enough people like you purchase Block N Load, or even try out a beta key for it and start playing, these problems will be resolved.\n\nAnd I can assure you, as soon as this game goes out of beta, it has the chance to either crash terribly or be the next Team Fortress Two. In the end, it's up to you. Do you want to play the game and help them steer it to become a better game, or ignore it altogether.\n\nThat's all I wanted to say, and I hope this helped to some of you in some way.","January 28, 2015","true","469.4"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","20","25","2","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lapoonie/recommended/299360/","lapoonie","Lapoonie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lapoonie/","123 products in account","5 Reasons Block N Load is Amazing and Creative\n\nBlock N Load is the game that I’ve been craving. It’s incredibly addicting, fun, and easy to jump into and blow ♥♥♥♥ up. I’m just going to jump right into it to convince you to splurge 15 dollars on this great game. Normally not a fan of Jagex (never liked Runescape or played any other games), you can assure I’m not biased. I’m basing this list solely on what I’ve enjoyed through playing the game.\n\n1. Superb Matchmaking\n\nFinding games in Block N Load is quick! I often found myself getting put into instant-queues that were great when I didn’t feel like waiting or alt-tabbing for an extended length of time (I’m looking at you DOTA!). For a game with a relatively (hopefully growing) player base, this is very exciting.\n\nPerhaps my favorite thing about the matchmaking is that you can choose to queue into games where players have rage quit abandoned their teammates in the middle of a battle. It works great for both parties–for those who need team mates and for those who want to get into a match remarkably quickly.\n\nIn these situations, you get a chance to become a hero to your team mates and freshen up a stale game. You very well might be the tide to turn the battle around! In fact, I noticed that happening in certain situations. We would be steam rolling the enemy, and a new player would show up with a unique perspective (and class) and make things interesting for both teams!\n\n2. Sweet Class Balance and Diversity\n\nWhen I was first playing the game, I often found myself wanting to be other classes or have other blocks–while I was playing my own. If I lost, I had a feeling. “If I just would have had this tool, then we could have won.” But then as I played the game more I began to get a deeper understanding of the blocks you can choose in the game and each of the classes strengths and weaknesses.\n\nEach one of the classes is restricted to individual blocks that they can build. I think this is a great ruleset in that it forces players to diversify their played classes and playstyles to a particular class. For example, while the ninja class doesn’t appeal to me–it’s fancy fake blocks, and snares do. Each class has something cool about it, and very strong as well. Because of that, it keeps things very fresh when switching from class to class.\n\nEach role also feels well pitted up against other classes. Sometimes matchups (like sniper versus ninja) tend to feel a bit “rock-paper-scissors”, but a big and compelling part of the strategy in the game is knowing where to position yourself on the map against your opponents. You’ll often finder snipers obsessing over towers, ninjas digging tunnels endlessly, and engineers protecting giant caverns with their turrets. In this game, everyone becomes their role, which is surprising and sometimes hilarious. I had a sniper insisting we leave an island solely for him (even if mining the island would give a universal 1000+ resources to the entire team!). Oh yeah, did I mention that the physics in this game let you mine huge chunks of a block mass by cutting out the base and letting gravity take things down? You also get the resources too!\n\nThe “Rambo” guy as I like to call him is the jack of all trades (and my favorite) as you can build him either offensively, defensively or both. The engineer specializes in amazingly high defensive maneuvers. The sniper and ninja class both act as pure damage classes with specializations in short and long range, with tricky traps in both arsenals. I  wanted to give you some examples of the differences between classes, but I don’t want to give an in-depth analysis of every class because part of the fun is exploring them yourself!\n\n3. Clear but Fair Objectives\n\nOne of Block N Load’s greatest strengths is both how it takes from MOBA games and how it changes concrete MOBA dynamics. This time there is three towers, and you can’t skip towers–instead you have to kill them in sequential order (similar to other MOBA games). The three tower system (sometimes different on the maps) create significant momentum in games and provides different routes and playstyles. Did your first defense fail? Perhaps try a different approach for your protection of the 2nd node.\n\nAnother strong element in the game is the focus on teamwork and strategy. In a lot of MOBA games, one player often snowballs. However, while Block N Load doesn’t necessarily punish players who do well, players never reach that sense of frustrating godliness that they do in other MOBAs. If the team bands together to take out a particularly strong set of turrets, that player who built the turrets will have to start over. There aren’t items, or levels, just blocks, and lots and lots of explosions.\n\nYou’d think this would make the end game boring, but the game works through a resource gathering system that encourages constant growth. The more blocks you destroy in the map, the more formations/traps/buildings you can build. There’s no ceiling for your ambition (which is another thing MOBA games lack–only six items at a cap, or a maximum level).\n\nThe game match length and momentum feels fantastic. The longer games feel tense in the end, and if a team coordinates well–sometimes incredible comebacks can happen.\n\n4. Good Community Game\n\nI’ve met a lot of cool people playing Block N Load. The game demands communication. Thankfully there’s great voice support in the game to encourage great teamwork (for some reason it doesn’t tell you who is talking or that you are, but this is easily remedied by asking the player or making sure others can hear you!).\n\nLike I said before, people can’t ever leave a game in a sense–since they are always replaced by someone else. I’ve found this is a massive increase in team morale and the people I’ve seen trash talking (only a few I can remember) usually leave and are replaced with a more competent teammate.\n\nWhy can’t other games do this? Well… Remember how I said classes can’t snowball and there isn’t any items? So when someone joins a match fresh, they are on the same level as everyone else (of course without all of the setup blocks and level knowledge). No one wants to join a League of Legends game feeding from the start.\n\n5. Weapons and Mechanics\n\nShooting in Block N Load is great. It feels a bit arcadey but more realistic than say TF2. Sometimes the guns don’t feel powerful enough, but enemies have health bars and numbers come out which makes it very easy to tell the damage you are doing and how effective you are at doing it.\n\nSniping people isn’t so much about one shot one kills, but more about taking bonus headshot damage. The shooting feels a bit similar to Borderlands 2. All of the weapons also have great hitboxes and range, and it’s incredibly satisfying to shoot at someone hiding behind blocks and do damage to them (I love the rocket launcher).\n\n\n\nWell, that’s my top 5 reasons to play Block N Load. I just recently picked up this game on steam and have already clocked an impressive amount of play time. It has great addicting gameplay that borrows from objective and team style MOBA games but also combines the creativity inherent in games like Minecraft.\n\n\n\nSource: http://www.news-loot.com/2015/05/06/5-reasons-block-n-load-is-amazing-and-creative/","May 4, 2015","true","79.2"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","17","21","2","0"

It's not crazy hard to pick up a new character.  Too many game make it impossible to use another role because the knowledge ramp to get into it is too massive.  Here I found that I could be adequate with just about any role (ninja did take me slightly longer to get good at) without needing a month of practice.\n\n3.  I usually don't like voxel based games because it just seems like an excuse to be lame on the art in many case.  NOT HERE.  It's really quite beautiful and there are tons of funny details that make me chuckle along the way.  Not to mention the most important thing is the characters and they are epic.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/premiumfootwear/recommended/299360/","premiumfootwear","Gaige","http://steamcommunity.com/id/premiumfootwear/","141 products in account","Block N Load is a fun game with a fun formula. I'm writing a positive review because I love this game to death, but I'm going to focus on the negatives here.\n\nIt has a steep learning curve, there is a lot to learn about how certain blocks work and how they should be placed, and the game does little to teach players how these mechanics work. It can be offputting to newcomers because of this. Even worse, there are players who treat beginners with open hostility (something that is relatively common amongst competitive shooters). The game has a small playerbase too, so the time between matches can be long.\n\nSince the game went free to play, characters must now be bought in order to be used, aside from whichever three characters are on free rotation. There are some characters that are difficult to use for newcomers, and yet they will still be on free rotation at times, essentially leaving a new player to learn both the game and a complicated character at once. It can just be too much. Thankfully, the game does give new players a little spending money, which is more than enough to buy a balanced hero that is easier and more fun to use. The game doesn't give much information in regards to which ones those are though, so without some advice it's tough to know who's worth starting with. Players on the discussion board are usually willing to give such advice though, so if you're considering playing this game, feel free to head over there.\n\nLooking past those negatives, Block N Load provides an experience unlike any other out there in regards to shooters. Essentially a spiritual sequel to the game Ace of Spades, Block N Load let's the player destroy and build blocks on the map. With a good roster of characters to choose from, plenty of fun can be had in this game. There is strategy in both building up your own defenses, and then working on how to take down the enemies. If you're willing to put in some time to learn this game, then it really does deliver. Just be prepared to deal with a rocky start as you get used to the game.","April 12","true","423.0"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

The correct term is "ispiration for something original".\n\nBlock N Load combines a full class-based team FPS experience with a blocky 5v5 MOBA game, where you can build and reinforce your base AND destroy the enemy's. Each class has its own perks, and each one of them brings their own weapons and special blocks to help their team. All roles can be fulfilled by anyone, but some are better than others at certain tasks. All classes are balanced and competitive. Heck, you can duel as any class with an opponent and you'll always have a hope to win! There are no instakills in this game, if you want to bring down your opponent you gotta earn it like a pro.\n\nWork as a Team! Only teamwork will lead you to victory!\nUse your preparation time wisely! Build a base, earn resources by destroying blocks and demolishing entire structures with gratuitous laws of gravity! You'll need a lot of resources to build and reinforce, especially the Defensive classes.\n\nAttack the enemy from the sides, the underground and the sky. Dig trenches and secret passages. Demolish the enemy's base with bombs and artillery barrages to help your digging tools. Place special structures behind them to allow respawning directly in their base and spying their movements... or build an entire base in their base, complete with turrets and mines, to make their lives hell! Hard as hell, but worth it!\n\nDefend your base with mines, radars, turrets and lethal traps. No enemy must infiltrate your base unseen. Invaders must die!\n\nCamping in an isolated corner won't get anything accomplished. Your kill count doesn't count. What matters is that you either defend your base OR attack the enemy base.\n\nBalance means victory! Avoid using classes of which your team already has 1 or 2. Only certain classes can place certain blocks.\n\nSo what are you waiting for? Block in and give those Blockheads what's coming to 'em! Block Block Block!

First of Let me say that this is far from an Ace Of Spades rip of or fancy reskin. Anyone who plays for a decent amount of time will be able to confirm that.\nBlock N load is all about team work, and preperation, But it also features fast paced combat requireng strategy and planing inorder to achive victory over your opponents. The team that wins will be the team that works together, plans together and  adapts to the enemys movements.\n\nBlock N Load is unique in that before combat begins, both teams get time to build defences to protect there objective. Building walls, radars, traps, turrets and the like can all help defend your precious base. Working togetehr is key to build an epic defence that will have your enemies stuck at the front door. Failure to build an effective defence will alow your foes to walk all over you. By doing this the game forces you to think carefully and be a bit creative in how you plan your defence. Its up to you to find a way to defend it as long as posible to give your team more time to attack.\n\nOnce the batle begins things heat up quickly. Battles can be fast paced and frantic and require quick thinking inorder to out wit your opponetns. Getting the high ground and working as a team to flank enemies is highly effective and landing a killing blow feels awesome and satisfying.\n\nAttacking the opponents base can offten be tricky and some times rather challenging. Especialy if its well fortified, yet there is a huge sense of Acheivment when you are able to open it up and watch it come crashing down. Blowing up a defensive line with a well placed bomb or mortar fells great and satisfying. I even caught myself shouting "KABOOOM!" (Ive been plaing lots of Demoman on TF2 latley, sue me) once when a well placed bomb of mine took out there wall along with 2 of there turrets and health and ammo staions, allowing my team to charge in and take out the remaing defences before going for the objective.\nWinning a match feels SO good and the satisfying sound of the enemy base exploding just puts the cherry on top.\n\nThere are several diffrent characters to try and all of them have strengths and weaknesses. A good team will have a mix that alows for both good defence and offence. A team that neglects one or the other can still win, but chances are they may strugle if they do not plan out their strategy well. Each character feels useful and unique and each plays in very diffrent ways. This alows for players to experiment and find characters and strategies that match there preferd play style or to branch out and try new and diffrent tactics that they would normaly avoid otherwise. At the moment there are 6 playable characters but there are more on the way and hopefully this will lead to new and exciting ways to play.\n\nWhile I have done nothing but praise the game so far there are a few issues that have disapointed me duing my 100+ hours of gameplay. The controls do feel a ♥♥♥♥♥ chunky at times and the jump mechanics do take a fair bit of getting used to, especialy if your used to playing games like TF2. Do not be suprised if you find yourself acidently jumping off a leadge to your death. There are also a few anoying bugs that still remain unfixed despite the game being out of beta, thankfully none of them truly ruin the game and they sould hopefully be on their way out soon.\n\nIt should also be mentioned that new players will most liekly strugle at first as they try and learn what works and what dose not work, when it come to attacking and defending.\n\nOverall this is a really fun game that alows for good team based combat and strategy. Players who like to rely on there brains as much as there skill will probably have a lot of fun at this. Just be sure to give the game a chance and you will most likely enjoy it.\n\nI Highly recomend you give this game a shot. Its fun, its clever, its well balanced, its action packed, and its highly enjoyable.\n\nGet in there and have some fun.\n(What the Block you gona do?)","May 4, 2015","true","177.6"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","13","19","2","0"

Once you've learnt a class you begin to feel like a master with them, knowing how and when to use your guns/abilities. Each class has their own blocks and special block to use, these give them an edge in battle whether it be defensive, offensive or supportive.\n\nEach class (some more than others) takes time to master, I really enjoy this side of gameplay due to it's rewarding nature of bonuses at level ups and new skins (as well as being able to destroy your opponents).\n\nMatches and Maps\n\nThere is a happy pool of maps to play on and you are given a choice between 2 when you join a lobby. Each map is unique and takes time to learn. As said for the classes, new maps are also being added.\n\nA slight negative is the regional servers; with the EU server I have been experiencing lag and not even being able to get into games, because of this I've had to play on NA servers despite the high ping.\n\nGameplay\n\nOverall it is very smooth, the movement is simple and enjoyable because of the rate at which you scale the maps, when learning this can be annoying at times (sprinting and jumping at someone and then flying over the edge of the map) but you'll soon pick it up. The gun play is great, each unique with different ranges and block damage.\n\nThis leads me onto the building/destroying side of things; the fact I would enjoy this game if the maps weren't interactable has to say something (a good something) about the gameplay, but being able to do this adds an unimaginable amount of creativity.\n\nSummary\n\nTo conclude; Block N Load has been a breath of fresh air for me in the FPS genre, it's large range of potential for future competitive play and continous updates makes me really want to stick around and see how everything turns out.\n\nMy final opinion on whether you should buy this game is: Yes, and if you used to play Minecraft and TF2: Hell yeah.\n\nNegative reviews...\n\nPlease take into account when reading the negative reviews the hours of game time and when they were posted. In most cases the player has very little time played or the review was made when the game was in beta. To be frank, I believe this game deserves at least a "very positive" review status.","May 10, 2015","true","34.4"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","13","19","0","0"

He has a rivet gun (Shot-gun) but the damn thing is extremely inaccurate and when you do hit, everyone completely out damages you almost instantly. He can place seven sentries, but none of them are any good. They all have a painfully small health pool and do almost nothing for damage against everyone other than another tony.\n\nDefending is much harder for the simple fact that they always tunnel in on the cube (What you must protect) completely bypassing the tony's sad excuse for a defense. what you end up with because of this is a messy cesspool riddled with holes of variours depths and tunnels going 9,0000 different ways, which makes defense all but impossible because without spending a good portion of the round smoothing the area around the cube out, there's no point behind placing sentries or traps or anything else for that matter. If they were to removed the digging aspect when near cubes, that would be fine.\n(I like the buliding aspect, not a huge fan of the digging. it's annoying to deal with.)\n\nThis game's version of the spy, while very strong (He's an infiltrator with a small health pool, if he's not dealing hefty damage, there's no point behind having him) at times feels too strong. that's manily because he "teleport" anywhere on the map with ease and the moment he takes too much damage he can just "Teleport" out of harms way.\n\nNigel, this games version of the sniper, is... okay? he can head-shot (For a lot of damage, but I don't think it flat-out kills someone) is odd in the sense that he has no-scope, making longer range marksmenship nearly pointless (A sniper that can't snipe all that well, Sounds really stupid but hey.) which leads to him being played more as a CQC class, which because his rifle has no scope, he does quite well with.\n\nIn TF2 you can phase into and out of players on your own team, in this game it's the reverse. You can't phase out of your own team( Is a utter nightmare when a newer player follows you down a hole and you want to go out the way you came in.) but you can phase into and past the enemy team, which makes CQC at times literally spray and pray. (Most likely why Tony's Shot-gun is utterly worthless, which it is. It's something even the "Vets" mostly agree on. it's too weak and too inaccurate to be his sole means of self defense.)\n\nTony can buff his sentries (At a cost of chewing through his ammo) to deal arguably greater damage, which is fantasic on paper because of how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ his sentries are on their own. However, you have no idea when your sentries firing on someone or being fired on when you have seven of them scattered across the map. you can repair them also while someones firing on them, but the range of his repair tool is sad. you tend to take spash damage when a cog or sarge is spamming at it, but most of the time it's pointless to even bother fighting off cogs/sarges due to their higher health and greater damage out-put. even if you can catch one low on health, you'll most likely still lose due to how lack-luster the rivet gun is.\n\nTony can not place respawn pads, which is odd because that would give him a greater offense role. (Setting up forward bases would be much easier.)\n\nThe respawn rate is... Bad would be a compliment. (34 seconds... Just let that sink in for a moment. Thought 20 seconds was bad, I feel sorry for you.)\n\nMap sizes are quite nice though, would prefer if each side got seven players, but five is alright.\n\nSarge (This games version of the soldier) is pretty worthless all and all. Because a tony can place health and ammo packs, Sarge can't. If you haven't unlocked Cog yet he's okay in a very loose way. But the moment you get a cog, do not bother with Sarge. Everything Sarge does, cog literally does 10X better.\n\nAll of this aside, the game can be something that can go toe-toe with TF2, just not right now. A few years time, this game might be something truly good.","October 3, 2015","false","61.3"," 36 of 64 people (56%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","56","36","64","9","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kappa1237/recommended/299360/","Kappa1237","Zeus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kappa1237/","20 products in account","So,this is my first serious review on a game.  Pros  : Great F2P figure,every hero is obtainable with gold. Only skins require real money. -Great graphics,it looks really detailed. Well,seems here I ran out of ideas xD. Cons: Community(a part of) really rude persons,griefing destroying your traps , turrets, mortars etc. Some will even team kill you,but only with some specific weapons/traps for example Rolys Cannons or Sarges Rocket launcher,C4 and grenaded. Yes,I reccomend this game,its really addicting and worth giving it a shot.Okay so I feel like editing this a little bit and adding something describing every hero there is (cheapest to the most expensive) Sergeant Sarge Stone:Sarge is a really good close range - mid range with his rocket launcher and LMG. His c4 is more of a troll block dont get me wrong.... lets move on to Nigel Purdy Longshott: For new players,I reccomend building a sniper tower. It will help you out to take out enemies. His tiki head is good in tight places,as of you cant get easily out. Also beartraps work best with fake blocks. Anthony Tony Turreto:Tony is a good choice if you want to defend,his turrets are hardly destroyed and can even be fixed. His rivet gun,is essentialy a shotgun,nothing more. As that is his only weapon,it is not reccomended to go attacking with. next hero with a bigger price tag: Cogwheel:Cog is preety good for starters because he has high health and high DPS makes him a great choice for attacking since hes a tank. OP Juan Shinobi: Most people recognise him as op but hes okay,he isnt that game breaking. He is a mobilty hero so he is good for attacking. Doc Eliza Doolally: This crazed doctor is really powerful with its Toxic Ball launcher and Chemical grenades. Her hero block,the miasma mine is good also in tight places(just like Nigels Tiki Head) she is good for both defense and attack. Moving on to the next heroes. Lets start up with Dream Genie: I find her more of a troll class because her weapons arent that effective she is good in the attack because she can play tricks on the other teams defense and its a good way of infiltrating in the enemy base without getting hurt. Sweet Science: Well,havent played with him alot but i got him on the free rotation. he has some abilities just like Juan to teleport and stuff and he is good at point blank range with his gloves. The gravity well isnt that effective since u can destroy it before it catches you but maybe you get killed in the process. Astarella:Also, I havent played much with her but i can say she can be very annoying but very effective if played well. And last but not least the most expensive characters. Vander Graaf:Also,havent played much with him but i can say he is a considerate option in the defense,but i find him underpowered.. next is Kira Chan: Havent played at all with her,but she is good in both attack and defense. The SMGS are great at close range and the Kitty Launcher seems like its Sarges RPG but comes with a grenade detonation mode. Yuri The Yeti: He is good at camping at the base with a big pile of ice because its his ammo resource,the snowballs can be deadly if you have good aim and the snowthrower is preety much useless(does 2 damage lel) and moving on to Roly Poly Fat Fat: I like this one alot,she is great. Even though i cant aim for days with her cannons she is still alot of fun. The cannons have a one shot then if you want to deal heavy damage they can be fired at once(but have to wait 1 second before you can shoot them again) The Booster is good for getting supply drops first and if you cover yourself in the enemy base I reccomend to use the toxic fumes because the enemies will get caught in them and then die. And last but not least Kreepy The Clown: I think he is great at range with the gloves also at point blank range with the other use of the gloves. The banana is ok,you can use it as an obstacle for the enemy team or  as a grenade. His Special ability is preety useless,next to the avalanche. Im preety much done now explaining every hero,if you want further explanation just write down the comments. IF you actually are reading this now. Buh Bye! Oh and I have to add a con,sorry I had to :p,but there are some server problems out there,it just freezes.","February 9","true","104.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

I've been playing a bit recently because it went free and it has drawing aspects, but 70% of my matches are unmatched pain from broken mechanics, and having a team of snipers all being played by what I presume are five year olds. Buckle in this will be a long one.\n\n\nPros:\n\n-Pay model is fair on free players and doesn't seem to provide any real advantage other than you can select other heroes who will eventually appear on free rotation anyway.\n\n-In concept the gamemode is nice, building a fort and trying to break into the enemies can offer interesting strategies and meta game.\n\n\nCons:\n\n-No time limit and players rarely doing anything asides from sitting at base killing with no attempt to hit the objective leads to games that last for well over half an hour which is absolute hell.\n\n-You can't change classes, while this isn't an issue in mobas which this takes some ideas from, the classes are so unbalanced and heavily countering that certain strategies being enacted by the enemy will prevent you from doing anything productive if you didn't pick the right class for the situation. In other words expect to be locked in long frustrating deadlocks that you can rarely escape from unless your teammates assist you.\n\n-They won't. They won't even attempt to destroy the objective 90% of the time.\n\n-No class limitations, this means it's not uncommon to see every other player on your team lock into a half an hour or longer match playing as nothing but the sniper class. For a game that has such an attempted focus on the objective this pretty much guarantees that you will lose the match after a long grueling deadlock.\n\n-The community is mostly children. Most people who you play with in a class locking objective centered game have no strategic thoughts going through their heads, they will not pursue the objective, they will rarely help defend if you need it, they will float around, often go afk and block a respawn point, and prematurely leave the game part way through regularly. When they do stay, they will not listen to you if you ask them to attack the core or defend.\n\n-Squad size is limited to two players, so you can only bring one friend with you to endure the cesspool of other people who will make up your team.\n\n-Sentry spam. If you are up against a semi-competent engineer this will make life hell if you are the wrong class, they will plant sentries inside your base, all around theirs, and all throughout the map and choke points. Without a good team (see previous points) you will most likely not be able to stop the spam from progressively getting worse. Sometimes an enemy team may have two or more engineers so getting through their defenses (since you will be doing this alone) will be next to impossible.\n\n-Children like Snipers. Most of your team will be snipers. The enemy team will often have multiple snipers. They do what you'd expect, camp, do a lot of damage, they're everywhere and they are frustrating to play with and against when there is more than one. Also if you get into close quarters with one and say, minigun them in the face, they will sprint away at full speed with zero speed impediment and go camp a healing station.\n\n-On that last point, walking speed is fairly slow, but many classes (sniper included) move at warp speed when they sprint, so many people will camp, chip off your hp, you'll lower theirs faster, and they will then warp out of a fight to go camp their health station right next to all of their turrets, or they'll hide in their base. (yeah, it's one of THOSE games.) If you pick the wrong class, expect to be encumbered the entire game without the means to pursue these people.\n\n-Enemies will get a health pack when you die so you cannot knock down their hp that much for teammates because they will heal right up and continue camping their sentries or any other number of annoying things that they will continue to do for over half an hour.\n\n-If you want to dodge an enemies shots, stand as close to their gun as possible. This works in reverse when enemies come right up to you because due to the shoddy way this game is designed it becomes abnormally difficult to hit targets.\n\n-The voice acting will drive you insane. (at least you can turn it off)\n\n\n\nTl;dr, Reach into your ♥♥♥ right now, and pull out a fistful of your hairs, this is a much more painless and fun filled experience than playing this game with its community. Why? Because it's quicker.","October 5, 2015","false","14.2"," 50 of 91 people (55%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","55","50","91","18","8"

(Setting up forward bases would be much easier.)\n\nThe respawn rate is... Bad would be a compliment. (34 seconds... Just let that sink in for a moment. Thought 20 seconds was bad, I feel sorry for you.)\n\nMap sizes are quite nice though, would prefer if each side got seven players, but five is alright.\n\nSarge (This games version of the soldier) is pretty worthless all and all. Because a tony can place health and ammo packs, Sarge can't. If you haven't unlocked Cog yet he's okay in a very loose way. But the moment you get a cog, do not bother with Sarge. Everything Sarge does, cog literally does 10X better.\n\nAll of this aside, the game can be something that can go toe-toe with TF2, just not right now. A few years time, this game might be something truly good.","October 3, 2015","false","61.3"," 36 of 64 people (56%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","56","36","64","9","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kappa1237/recommended/299360/","Kappa1237","Zeus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kappa1237/","20 products in account","So,this is my first serious review on a game.  Pros  : Great F2P figure,every hero is obtainable with gold. Only skins require real money. -Great graphics,it looks really detailed. Well,seems here I ran out of ideas xD. Cons: Community(a part of) really rude persons,griefing destroying your traps , turrets, mortars etc. Some will even team kill you,but only with some specific weapons/traps for example Rolys Cannons or Sarges Rocket launcher,C4 and grenaded. Yes,I reccomend this game,its really addicting and worth giving it a shot.Okay so I feel like editing this a little bit and adding something describing every hero there is (cheapest to the most expensive) Sergeant Sarge Stone:Sarge is a really good close range - mid range with his rocket launcher and LMG. His c4 is more of a troll block dont get me wrong.... lets move on to Nigel Purdy Longshott: For new players,I reccomend building a sniper tower. It will help you out to take out enemies. His tiki head is good in tight places,as of you cant get easily out. Also beartraps work best with fake blocks. Anthony Tony Turreto:Tony is a good choice if you want to defend,his turrets are hardly destroyed and can even be fixed. His rivet gun,is essentialy a shotgun,nothing more. As that is his only weapon,it is not reccomended to go attacking with. next hero with a bigger price tag: Cogwheel:Cog is preety good for starters because he has high health and high DPS makes him a great choice for attacking since hes a tank. OP Juan Shinobi: Most people recognise him as op but hes okay,he isnt that game breaking. He is a mobilty hero so he is good for attacking. Doc Eliza Doolally: This crazed doctor is really powerful with its Toxic Ball launcher and Chemical grenades. Her hero block,the miasma mine is good also in tight places(just like Nigels Tiki Head) she is good for both defense and attack. Moving on to the next heroes. Lets start up with Dream Genie: I find her more of a troll class because her weapons arent that effective she is good in the attack because she can play tricks on the other teams defense and its a good way of infiltrating in the enemy base without getting hurt. Sweet Science: Well,havent played with him alot but i got him on the free rotation. he has some abilities just like Juan to teleport and stuff and he is good at point blank range with his gloves. The gravity well isnt that effective since u can destroy it before it catches you but maybe you get killed in the process. Astarella:Also, I havent played much with her but i can say she can be very annoying but very effective if played well. And last but not least the most expensive characters. Vander Graaf:Also,havent played much with him but i can say he is a considerate option in the defense,but i find him underpowered.. next is Kira Chan: Havent played at all with her,but she is good in both attack and defense. The SMGS are great at close range and the Kitty Launcher seems like its Sarges RPG but comes with a grenade detonation mode. Yuri The Yeti: He is good at camping at the base with a big pile of ice because its his ammo resource,the snowballs can be deadly if you have good aim and the snowthrower is preety much useless(does 2 damage lel) and moving on to Roly Poly Fat Fat: I like this one alot,she is great. Even though i cant aim for days with her cannons she is still alot of fun. The cannons have a one shot then if you want to deal heavy damage they can be fired at once(but have to wait 1 second before you can shoot them again) The Booster is good for getting supply drops first and if you cover yourself in the enemy base I reccomend to use the toxic fumes because the enemies will get caught in them and then die. And last but not least Kreepy The Clown: I think he is great at range with the gloves also at point blank range with the other use of the gloves. The banana is ok,you can use it as an obstacle for the enemy team or  as a grenade. His Special ability is preety useless,next to the avalanche. Im preety much done now explaining every hero,if you want further explanation just write down the comments. IF you actually are reading this now. Buh Bye! Oh and I have to add a con,sorry I had to :p,but there are some server problems out there,it just freezes.","February 9","true","104.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

I've been playing a bit recently because it went free and it has drawing aspects, but 70% of my matches are unmatched pain from broken mechanics, and having a team of snipers all being played by what I presume are five year olds. Buckle in this will be a long one.\n\n\nPros:\n\n-Pay model is fair on free players and doesn't seem to provide any real advantage other than you can select other heroes who will eventually appear on free rotation anyway.\n\n-In concept the gamemode is nice, building a fort and trying to break into the enemies can offer interesting strategies and meta game.\n\n\nCons:\n\n-No time limit and players rarely doing anything asides from sitting at base killing with no attempt to hit the objective leads to games that last for well over half an hour which is absolute hell.\n\n-You can't change classes, while this isn't an issue in mobas which this takes some ideas from, the classes are so unbalanced and heavily countering that certain strategies being enacted by the enemy will prevent you from doing anything productive if you didn't pick the right class for the situation. In other words expect to be locked in long frustrating deadlocks that you can rarely escape from unless your teammates assist you.\n\n-They won't. They won't even attempt to destroy the objective 90% of the time.\n\n-No class limitations, this means it's not uncommon to see every other player on your team lock into a half an hour or longer match playing as nothing but the sniper class. For a game that has such an attempted focus on the objective this pretty much guarantees that you will lose the match after a long grueling deadlock.\n\n-The community is mostly children. Most people who you play with in a class locking objective centered game have no strategic thoughts going through their heads, they will not pursue the objective, they will rarely help defend if you need it, they will float around, often go afk and block a respawn point, and prematurely leave the game part way through regularly. When they do stay, they will not listen to you if you ask them to attack the core or defend.\n\n-Squad size is limited to two players, so you can only bring one friend with you to endure the cesspool of other people who will make up your team.\n\n-Sentry spam. If you are up against a semi-competent engineer this will make life hell if you are the wrong class, they will plant sentries inside your base, all around theirs, and all throughout the map and choke points. Without a good team (see previous points) you will most likely not be able to stop the spam from progressively getting worse. Sometimes an enemy team may have two or more engineers so getting through their defenses (since you will be doing this alone) will be next to impossible.\n\n-Children like Snipers. Most of your team will be snipers. The enemy team will often have multiple snipers. They do what you'd expect, camp, do a lot of damage, they're everywhere and they are frustrating to play with and against when there is more than one. Also if you get into close quarters with one and say, minigun them in the face, they will sprint away at full speed with zero speed impediment and go camp a healing station.\n\n-On that last point, walking speed is fairly slow, but many classes (sniper included) move at warp speed when they sprint, so many people will camp, chip off your hp, you'll lower theirs faster, and they will then warp out of a fight to go camp their health station right next to all of their turrets, or they'll hide in their base. (yeah, it's one of THOSE games.) If you pick the wrong class, expect to be encumbered the entire game without the means to pursue these people.\n\n-Enemies will get a health pack when you die so you cannot knock down their hp that much for teammates because they will heal right up and continue camping their sentries or any other number of annoying things that they will continue to do for over half an hour.\n\n-If you want to dodge an enemies shots, stand as close to their gun as possible. This works in reverse when enemies come right up to you because due to the shoddy way this game is designed it becomes abnormally difficult to hit targets.\n\n-The voice acting will drive you insane. (at least you can turn it off)\n\n\n\nTl;dr, Reach into your ♥♥♥ right now, and pull out a fistful of your hairs, this is a much more painless and fun filled experience than playing this game with its community. Why? Because it's quicker.","October 5, 2015","false","14.2"," 50 of 91 people (55%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","55","50","91","18","8"

BnL is trying to have a fine balance between letting a player enjoy base building such as placing blocks, traps, turrets and other gadgets around within a certain time limit, before all hell breaks loose and the big wall is removed. At the same time it is allowing first person shooter fans to have fun just shooting anything and everything, blocks, traps, turrets, players and so on.\n\nWhether you want to focus on building defense, traps and buildings using blocks then you can contribute that way. If you want to go in gunning, then you can do that. If you want to stay behind and snipe, you can do that too. Maybe you want to sneak around and climb up the walls, you can do that too. Perhaps you want to mix it all up, you can do that too.\n\nAll in all, it offers a great variety and strategy when playing. If you don't care much for team play you can still have fun just playing lone wolf, gathering resources by breaking bricks and using them to put out lots of firepower in turrets or just traps, even intel such as radar.\n\nIf you are terrible at FPS but always wanted to have fun playing an FPS this is your chance to still be a team player, contribute and even end up first in your team...even if you lost the match. As you rack up points also by destroying bricks and placements while building new things. So killing alone might not be sufficient anymore.\n\nSo if you enjoy building, placing out things, sneaking, sniping, gunning, running, climbing, jumping, digging, healing, being random, trying to be creative or figure out new ways to combine the different classes you all play as a team who have access to different equipment, to create a new way to attack, defend or just be crazy creative while bombs and gunshot is flying around...then so be it. Do that...\n\nIt's a great game. Play it...\n\nClasses - Standard equipment + unique equipment for the class you choose. Level them up, get bonus and more powerful buffs...\n\nCome on, go on....I know you want to play it...","April 29, 2015","true","55.1"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","13","21","0","0"

You should buy it if you enjoy:\n\n- a tactical shooter in which mindless run&gun is punished by an increasing respawn timer and various devious traps that the enemy team builds\n\n- coordinating with friends to pull off crazy stunts\n\n- shooters where you don't die instantly but instead have the ability to balance for screw-ups by tactics and coordination\n\nYou shouldn't buy it if:\n\n- You like to run and gun and think that teamwork is for sissies\n\n- You feel like a 40 second respawn timer after 40 minutes of match is too long (the respawn gets longer the longer the game goes on. To prevent eternal games)\n\n- You value solo-play. The game is best when you work together with your team mates. This goes all the way down to your character class selection. The team can't be all Ninjas, so you should be prepared to pick something useful instead.\n\nIn general this game is great fun. The graphics are vibrant, the gameplay is very polished and overall balanced. The game rewards playing smart and punishes mindless stupidity.

It is amazing to see the almost weekly changes to maps, classes, weapons in an attempt to provide a great gameplay experience.\n\nGood luck,keep going :)\nThis game has a bright future ahead of it <3","March 18, 2015","true","398.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

You can play with every other users, on every maps. Try it before you buy it ! ;) Also a pack (5 players) is available if you have any friends that are willing to play with you.\n\nPros (+)\nIncredible freedom with blocks, it feels good to model the battlefield ! You can dig holes to make traps, create bridge, sneak around below thanks to tunnels, create bunkers. This is great to use your creativity to defend and attack !\nThe devs are quite present (especially on reddit), and listen to the complaints as well as the questions of the player. (You can find a discussion I had with them on reddit, search for ArthurCP). This feels great to be able to contact people from within !\nThe characters available are quite different and each bring something powerful and different with them ! From the turret makers to the very mobile ninja, and also a robot making mortars. You're sure to find a character suited to you !\nDevs plan to add more characters, more blocks for MORE FUN!  Cons (-)\n\nLack of players sometimes but not a big issue in my opinion, didn't really felt the lack of players. You might have to wait a few minutes to get into a game. Jagex (the company that own the game) is making a lot of marketing to help onto that.\nJagex do not have a great reputation in the gaming world as they ♥♥♥♥ed up some games. But seems like Block N Load is a completely different story (AT THE MOMENT, 26/06/2015).\nSome issues with the matchmaking, that allow team of multiple experimented players against casual/new players. This lead to a very bad first view of the game for the new players.\nEven if there's negative points, I highly recommend this game as it's skill rewarding (creativity, time to learn some "construction" such as bunkers, etc.) and I find the atmosphere really enjoyable !\n\n","June 26, 2015","true","300.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I honestly cannot remember the last time I had so much fun playing a shooter.\n\nGraphics:\nThe graphics look much more like TF2 than Minecraft, but are unique to themselves. Though there are blocks, many of them are not cubes. There are all shapes and sizes.  It looks sleek and modern, not retro at all. There are also nice shadow and lighting effects. The style works for the type of game it is. In the heat of battles, blocks fly everywhere from explosions going off all around you, which adds to the experience drasticly.\n\nGameplay:\nFirst and foremost is the unique ability to break or build anything. It adds a layer of strategy not found in most shooters. Defenses do not have to be complicated to be effective, though complicated desings can work if applied correctly. It takes a lot of time to develop good strategies for building on each map.\nOnce the match begins, after the build stage, you can do just about anything. Digging under a base is as viable as building over one. As others have said, unlike in Minecraft, there is gravity, so you will not be able to build floating bridges.\nEach character feels really unique, and you really need one from each of the 3 categories to be successful (usually).  The weapons in this game are SOOO satisfying. A combination of good sound effects and visual effects makes each one pop, and landing a shot, no matter the weapon, always feels good. Each character also has a special ability, which, for most characters, offers support for yourself and all surrounding teamates.\nTeamwork is key in this game. You need to use text or voice chat to tell eachother what you are doing, and make sure to plan attacks ahead of time. Running in wildly is not an option in this game, even for the tank class Cog.\n\nRight now there is only one gamemode: Destroy the Base, but the developers are going to have more ready for launch in less than a month. I am hoping for a Payload type mode, where players place the tracks for the bomb train to follow.\n\nDespite just one gamemode, I have yet to become bored, thanks to well designed maps that offer good variety. Player map creation is another planned feature to be looking forward to.\n\nOverall I would HIGHLY recommend this game. It has something for everybody, even those who don't usually like shooters. I hope that this game will continue to expand and grow a healthy community once it is released in a few weeks!","April 5, 2015","true","74.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Shows that they really put effort into their game.\nAround Christmas, they had an event where you had to play 20 matches, to get a Tony skin (Tony is one of the playable characters).\n\nI love the quick combat and the variable combat in this game. Want a new way to go? Dig down and dig away! "Dig your way to victory!"\n\nRate? 8/10. I would like to see more small maps, rather than big maps.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wunbrow/recommended/299360/","wunbrow","Wunbrow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wunbrow/","189 products in account","I tried this game only because of the free weekend offered on Steam.  Its a Minecraft-ish, tower defence/attack, team FPS.  After playing a few games I discovered I really liked it so dished out the cash and bought it.  At the start of a game each team is closed off to prepare their defence of the cubes.  This involves building/destroying walls, setting traps and adding defences.  Once the "curtain" drops the game starts in earnest and you will have to defend the cube against the other team as well attack their cube.  You can do this by running in gung-ho, sneaking around the defences or tunnelling in from below.  Sometimes you get stuffed with a rubbish team and you are doomed from the start but to be honest I still enjoy the gameplay.  There is a variety of pre-set characters who are cartoonlike (in fact very Borderlands) but very well drawn with amusing one liners (which do start to get annoying and can give away your position).  So yes I will give this a positive review just because I have had my £10 worth out of the game.  There are more updates coming as well as a new character.\n\ni really really like this game, HOWEVER the queue times are not acceptable.  So I have changed this review.  I quite regularly queue for 5 or so minutes, finally get in a game and then the 10th person doesnt accept.  You then find yourself at the start of another queue starting at zero.  Also if you do get in a game, you may play a game where one cube is destroyed and you get an ♥♥♥♥ in your team who just wants to give up so continually spams Surrender.  If you fail to agree, he/she will then just type abuse and then eventually when you refuse to give up will then attack you and your defence and assist the enemy team.  Then to make it worse at the end of the match they vote you as a bad player just because you want to play the game.  It quite often takes 10 minutes to get in a game so I never want to surrender no matter how bad my team.  The down vote by the "♥♥♥♥" player then affects your queue times negatively.  It is such a shame that the queues are so bad and the fact that the kids get to vote against your willingness to play when it looks like you are losing.  Therefore I cant recommend it any longer.  A great game but ruined by really long queue times.","May 12, 2015","false","94.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wunbrow/recommended/299360/","wunbrow","Wunbrow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wunbrow/","189 products in account","I tried this game only because of the free weekend offered on Steam.  Its a Minecraft-ish, tower defence/attack, team FPS.  After playing a few games I discovered I really liked it so dished out the cash and bought it.  At the start of a game each team is closed off to prepare their defence of the cubes.  This involves building/destroying walls, setting traps and adding defences.  Once the "curtain" drops the game starts in earnest and you will have to defend the cube against the other team as well attack their cube.  You can do this by running in gung-ho, sneaking around the defences or tunnelling in from below.  Sometimes you get stuffed with a rubbish team and you are doomed from the start but to be honest I still enjoy the gameplay.  There is a variety of pre-set characters who are cartoonlike (in fact very Borderlands) but very well drawn with amusing one liners (which do start to get annoying and can give away your position).  So yes I will give this a positive review just because I have had my £10 worth out of the game.  There are more updates coming as well as a new character.\n\ni really really like this game, HOWEVER the queue times are not acceptable.  So I have changed this review.  I quite regularly queue for 5 or so minutes, finally get in a game and then the 10th person doesnt accept.  You then find yourself at the start of another queue starting at zero.  Also if you do get in a game, you may play a game where one cube is destroyed and you get an ♥♥♥♥ in your team who just wants to give up so continually spams Surrender.  If you fail to agree, he/she will then just type abuse and then eventually when you refuse to give up will then attack you and your defence and assist the enemy team.  Then to make it worse at the end of the match they vote you as a bad player just because you want to play the game.  It quite often takes 10 minutes to get in a game so I never want to surrender no matter how bad my team.  The down vote by the "♥♥♥♥" player then affects your queue times negatively.  It is such a shame that the queues are so bad and the fact that the kids get to vote against your willingness to play when it looks like you are losing.  Therefore I cant recommend it any longer.  A great game but ruined by really long queue times.","May 12, 2015","false","94.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","1"

I honestly cannot remember the last time I had so much fun playing a shooter.\n\nGraphics:\nThe graphics look much more like TF2 than Minecraft, but are unique to themselves. Though there are blocks, many of them are not cubes. There are all shapes and sizes.  It looks sleek and modern, not retro at all. There are also nice shadow and lighting effects. The style works for the type of game it is. In the heat of battles, blocks fly everywhere from explosions going off all around you, which adds to the experience drasticly.\n\nGameplay:\nFirst and foremost is the unique ability to break or build anything. It adds a layer of strategy not found in most shooters. Defenses do not have to be complicated to be effective, though complicated desings can work if applied correctly. It takes a lot of time to develop good strategies for building on each map.\nOnce the match begins, after the build stage, you can do just about anything. Digging under a base is as viable as building over one. As others have said, unlike in Minecraft, there is gravity, so you will not be able to build floating bridges.\nEach character feels really unique, and you really need one from each of the 3 categories to be successful (usually).  The weapons in this game are SOOO satisfying. A combination of good sound effects and visual effects makes each one pop, and landing a shot, no matter the weapon, always feels good. Each character also has a special ability, which, for most characters, offers support for yourself and all surrounding teamates.\nTeamwork is key in this game. You need to use text or voice chat to tell eachother what you are doing, and make sure to plan attacks ahead of time. Running in wildly is not an option in this game, even for the tank class Cog.\n\nRight now there is only one gamemode: Destroy the Base, but the developers are going to have more ready for launch in less than a month. I am hoping for a Payload type mode, where players place the tracks for the bomb train to follow.\n\nDespite just one gamemode, I have yet to become bored, thanks to well designed maps that offer good variety. Player map creation is another planned feature to be looking forward to.\n\nOverall I would HIGHLY recommend this game. It has something for everybody, even those who don't usually like shooters. I hope that this game will continue to expand and grow a healthy community once it is released in a few weeks!","April 5, 2015","true","74.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

You can play with every other users, on every maps. Try it before you buy it ! ;) Also a pack (5 players) is available if you have any friends that are willing to play with you.\n\nPros (+)\nIncredible freedom with blocks, it feels good to model the battlefield ! You can dig holes to make traps, create bridge, sneak around below thanks to tunnels, create bunkers. This is great to use your creativity to defend and attack !\nThe devs are quite present (especially on reddit), and listen to the complaints as well as the questions of the player. (You can find a discussion I had with them on reddit, search for ArthurCP). This feels great to be able to contact people from within !\nThe characters available are quite different and each bring something powerful and different with them ! From the turret makers to the very mobile ninja, and also a robot making mortars. You're sure to find a character suited to you !\nDevs plan to add more characters, more blocks for MORE FUN!  Cons (-)\n\nLack of players sometimes but not a big issue in my opinion, didn't really felt the lack of players. You might have to wait a few minutes to get into a game. Jagex (the company that own the game) is making a lot of marketing to help onto that.\nJagex do not have a great reputation in the gaming world as they ♥♥♥♥ed up some games. But seems like Block N Load is a completely different story (AT THE MOMENT, 26/06/2015).\nSome issues with the matchmaking, that allow team of multiple experimented players against casual/new players. This lead to a very bad first view of the game for the new players.\nEven if there's negative points, I highly recommend this game as it's skill rewarding (creativity, time to learn some "construction" such as bunkers, etc.) and I find the atmosphere really enjoyable !\n\n","June 26, 2015","true","300.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

With it's catchy music, unique art style and competitive multiplayer, this game brings a lot of fun and friends to your PC. Each character you choose has a totally different fighting style and Silhouette, they each have a role to play on this team based multiplayer. Pick the wrong character setup and you may not do to well so choose wisely.\n\nYou are a 5 man team facing another 5 man team with your own side of the map. Once the match begins you have a few minuites to prep your base by setting up traps, reinforcing things or building anything you can think of that may help win the game. During this time you cannot see or go to the other teams base, once the timer hits zero each team is free to attack. You may still build after the timer but you will have non friendlys attacking you at any time. The way to win is to attack they enemies cube, a small square genereator looking cube. Depending on the map chosen in the beginning by voting, you may have up to 3 cubes to destroy.  Once one of the two teams destroys all of the cubes it is game over where you can look at your stats before heading back to start a new mach.\n\nI fell in love with Block N Load. It's refreshing to see something new on the market with a great community including friends from all over the world. Everyone is there to help you because they need you in order to win. The devs are very good at responding to any questions, concearns or just to chat occasionally. I find myself not wanting to stop playing even when I need to. Every game I find myself on the edge of my seat as I get into fast paced battles with other players seeing who can outsmart our destroy the other.  Each play is different and the game can change and flip at any moment, you will find yourself stuck fighting and defending untill one team breaks through enemy lines taking you and your cube down or vise versa. That is what makes me love this game, that is why I reccomend this game. No other game can you laugh, fight, and sometimes cry all in one match.","January 12, 2015","true","592.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There's different ways of trying to win a match. Also finding the perfect way to defend your base will probably be a long road.\n\nThe private matches are fun party games to do when you're with a bunch of friends and looking for things to play together.\n\nThe hero-system reminds me of League of Legends, you can choose from a bunch of heroes that all have different abilities. As far as I assume they will be adding more heroes over time(?)\n\nOverall I think this game is good fun!","October 20, 2015","true","15.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There's different ways of trying to win a match. Also finding the perfect way to defend your base will probably be a long road.\n\nThe private matches are fun party games to do when you're with a bunch of friends and looking for things to play together.\n\nThe hero-system reminds me of League of Legends, you can choose from a bunch of heroes that all have different abilities. As far as I assume they will be adding more heroes over time(?)\n\nOverall I think this game is good fun!","October 20, 2015","true","15.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

And now Im just telling everyone to not buy the game.\nThey have nerft the character a bit like how many degrees his attack reaches, and that when he teleports he would only release a cloud of smoke instead of a cloud of smoke and a bomb.\nBut the bomb is still there.\nHere I am ranting again...","June 19, 2015","false","145.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Block n load is also one of the only games on steam to not have 8 year old Russians screaming ♥♥♥♥ BLYAT down their mics and telling you about what they did with your mother last night.\n\nUnlike games like Dota and League of legends block n load always ends up with  a different map than how it started. Yes fps games will have them covered in blood and some console commands show where bullets hit but in this game the map is sometimes unrecognisable after a showering of mortar volleys and several extra hills of yuri's snow.\n\nSo if you have not yet pressed the download button 'JUST DO IT', cause it will 'MAKE YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE'.

Now it is free to play and my level has reset I find myself in matches with people who know nothing about the game, this basically shows you that the game is reliant on team play (which is good) sadly if you effectively defend but your team for some stupid reason doesn't attack then you can't win. Or if you are good at attacking yet your team suck at defending your cube is destroyed before you manage to destroy theirs.\n\nOverall maybe one day it will be cook but as for now I doubt ill be playing this game again.","October 4, 2015","false","64.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Perhaps I can argue that I bought Ace of spades and deserve to get this for free? D:\n\nJust so you guys know, I was one of the people who was horribly let down by Jagex's fantastic butchering of Ace Of Spades which left me unsatisfied and .

With no dedicated fanbase of origin like Ace Of Spades, they took some neat creative freedom, making a MOBA-styled shooter with building integrated into the gameplay. Gameplay can have a lot of variety, as one can shift between offense and defense pretty quickly! using the same character! Destructive items are limited by the fact that they cost a lot of "blocks" to build and take awhile to do so, discouraging griefers from just spamming bombs as they would have to gather the resources  to break blocks by digging a ton first.\n\nOnly nitpick I have right now is the time it takes to find a match, but that's presumably due to the game being in beta and weekend-long windows that the devs have been leaving for public testing. It's also a bit difficult to use the weapons in combat as there are no bots one can train against to help track moving targets, so it's reccomended you bring your 1337 tracking skillz to this game from other games.\n\nOverall, a very enjoyable and chaotic game!","April 26, 2015","true","16.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","2"

Not only do you get the game but some AMAZING skins and ace of spades. Jagex may have made some mistakes in the past but they're really bringing it back with BnL. This game gets tweaked  and updated so often and they are always adding new things, like how  recently they added 3 new characters. Also, there are loads of things to come such as new maps, characters, and even gamemodes!\n\nWhat I like about BnL is that you can play really casually or you can go hardcore if you want. Also, it's not violent compared to other FPS' and has a lot of variety. Like their motto says, no game is the same, and this  is completely true. BnL is a like a mix of TF2  and minecraft.

The gunplay is competent, but it is difficult to switch between weapons quickly. Charecters have a small amount of lines they spew out all the time, but at least they say somewhat humorous stuff.\n\nMy only real complaint is that keybinding isn't compatible with all keys on the keyboard. For instance, I can't bind crouch to shift.\n\nAll in all, I think Block N Load is a fun shooter, and is worthy of your time and money.\n\nDon't forget...\n\nBuilding is awesome.","January 3, 2015","true","150.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fuufuuuu/recommended/299360/","Fuufuuuu","Yuba","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fuufuuuu/","70 products in account","Now, I wasn't expecting much from this game. Another competitive block-building fps, we have hundreds of those on the market as it is. What really made me doubtful was that this game is being developed by Jagex, the very same Jagex that took Ace of Spades and made it an abomination. However, Block N Load surprised me. It takes all the good parts of all those cube-based fps and mashes them all together a giant... Well... Block!\n\nIf you have ever played Team Fortress 2, you may notice that this game is VERY simialar to the Fort Wars gamemode. It pits two teams of five on either side of a giant wall. You start with a certain amount of block points, and destroy blocks to make more. These teams must hurry to build their defenses with the resources given before the wall goes down. Once the wall is down, each team must fight through the opposing teams defenses to destroy three cubes in order, and they win. Sounds simple, right? Wrong! This game is clever, and allows you to create virtually any devious defense or trap in your base. There are a decent amount of maps atm, and more to come.All of this means that the gameplay is always changing, and you must overcome the obstacles of the enemy team while maintaining your OWN defenses.\n\nThe game has a variety of blocks you can create, like the commando's more offensive C4 block, or the scientists defensive miasma mine. Some blocks can be used to chain combos that can do massive damage to your enemy. Me and my friend once placed a bunch of fire traps underneath fake blocks. Right when the enemy walked over my fake blocks, they fell into a fiery death. It is very satisfying to combine your blocks with other players so that combos like these can happen, teamwork like this is a very good thing in Block N Load.\n\nClass balancing IS influenced in Block N Load, which is a huge plus. Each class has their own special block that only he/she can create. For example, the more defensive class, the construction worker, can create turrets. A more offensive class, the ninja, can create a ninja nest to teleport to. This means that each class has their own specific roles, whether it's defensive or offensive. You can't have an entire team of ninjas and expect to defend your base well. On the other hand, you can't have five construction workers and attack very well, either. These are only two classes of six in the game right now, I'm just using them because their good examples.\n\nNot only that, but the game looks surprisingly good under the circumstances. Most block-building fps have dull graphics, and look... Well... Gross. This game has nice looking visuals, great particle effects, and a pretty atmosphere. The models are cartoony, but in a neat way. Block N Load just looks well polished overall.\n\nTheir are only a few cons I can think of. As of right now, there's a lack of weapon diversity. Every class has the same loadout everytime. This isn't MUCH of an issue, it's just that it can get boring after a while to be the same class with the same weapons and abilities everytime. There's also only one gamemode, which also isn't too much of a problem for me at least. Yet, I can see the game getting more players if these problems were taken care of, as this one gamemode may not fancy to everyone. It IS in beta, so these problems are prone to change.\n\nOverall, I really enjoy Block N Load. It's a fresh new experience, with fun that will last a long time. If you need a new fps, I recommend giving this one a try.","December 15, 2014","true","2.1"," 15 of 28 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","15","28","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fuufuuuu/recommended/299360/","Fuufuuuu","Yuba","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fuufuuuu/","70 products in account","Now, I wasn't expecting much from this game. Another competitive block-building fps, we have hundreds of those on the market as it is. What really made me doubtful was that this game is being developed by Jagex, the very same Jagex that took Ace of Spades and made it an abomination. However, Block N Load surprised me. It takes all the good parts of all those cube-based fps and mashes them all together a giant... Well... Block!\n\nIf you have ever played Team Fortress 2, you may notice that this game is VERY simialar to the Fort Wars gamemode. It pits two teams of five on either side of a giant wall. You start with a certain amount of block points, and destroy blocks to make more. These teams must hurry to build their defenses with the resources given before the wall goes down. Once the wall is down, each team must fight through the opposing teams defenses to destroy three cubes in order, and they win. Sounds simple, right? Wrong! This game is clever, and allows you to create virtually any devious defense or trap in your base. There are a decent amount of maps atm, and more to come.All of this means that the gameplay is always changing, and you must overcome the obstacles of the enemy team while maintaining your OWN defenses.\n\nThe game has a variety of blocks you can create, like the commando's more offensive C4 block, or the scientists defensive miasma mine. Some blocks can be used to chain combos that can do massive damage to your enemy. Me and my friend once placed a bunch of fire traps underneath fake blocks. Right when the enemy walked over my fake blocks, they fell into a fiery death. It is very satisfying to combine your blocks with other players so that combos like these can happen, teamwork like this is a very good thing in Block N Load.\n\nClass balancing IS influenced in Block N Load, which is a huge plus. Each class has their own special block that only he/she can create. For example, the more defensive class, the construction worker, can create turrets. A more offensive class, the ninja, can create a ninja nest to teleport to. This means that each class has their own specific roles, whether it's defensive or offensive. You can't have an entire team of ninjas and expect to defend your base well. On the other hand, you can't have five construction workers and attack very well, either. These are only two classes of six in the game right now, I'm just using them because their good examples.\n\nNot only that, but the game looks surprisingly good under the circumstances. Most block-building fps have dull graphics, and look... Well... Gross. This game has nice looking visuals, great particle effects, and a pretty atmosphere. The models are cartoony, but in a neat way. Block N Load just looks well polished overall.\n\nTheir are only a few cons I can think of. As of right now, there's a lack of weapon diversity. Every class has the same loadout everytime. This isn't MUCH of an issue, it's just that it can get boring after a while to be the same class with the same weapons and abilities everytime. There's also only one gamemode, which also isn't too much of a problem for me at least. Yet, I can see the game getting more players if these problems were taken care of, as this one gamemode may not fancy to everyone. It IS in beta, so these problems are prone to change.\n\nOverall, I really enjoy Block N Load. It's a fresh new experience, with fun that will last a long time. If you need a new fps, I recommend giving this one a try.","December 15, 2014","true","2.1"," 15 of 28 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","15","28","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheRealSybre/recommended/299360/","TheRealSybre","Sybre","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheRealSybre/","122 products in account","This is a very interesting game. It takes MOBA style objectives in order to win, FPS style shooting, Minecraft style building all bundled together into one game. When first entering a game you have 5 mins to build with blocks. The goal of the game is to Protect your "cores" while attacking the enemy's. Within these 5 minutes you have to build fortifactions, and maybe a setup to build into No man's land. When this time is up the barrier that blocks you disappears and you attack. Every character is uniquely designed weapons wise. The medic has a gun that arcs balls, a robot with a chaingun, a soldier with a m60, a hunter with a sniper (scopeless), a ninja with shurikans, and an engineer with a shotgun. While these characters are interesting I do have to admit certain guns are directly more powerful than others. The sniper rifle can be used in CQB and is generally better than the Medic's "bubble gun". In certain times it can even trump the shotgun that can only be used in close quarters. While the chaingun does do fast damage. With that said maybe these classes aren't right for me since I use cogwheel the robot tank mostly. With all that said, this game plays well and is a lot of fun.  However I came along with some issues.\n\nNumber 1: The game can be VERY slow. As in the two teams just defend and no  one tries to make a move. I've been in many hour + games.\n\nWhile this is mostly the player's fault, it can be resolved with a timer ticking down or some sort of penalty.\n\nNumber 2: If you get stuck with a new player, you lost.\n\nThe game has a video explaining what to do, and it doesn't explain well. A hands on tutorial would be best to fix this\n\nNumber 3: If one person leaves, you are at a serious disadvantage and have a way greater chance at losing the game.\n\nLike issue number 1, this is more player's error, but can be fixed with a severe penalty. Leaving a game because you died once is no reason to make your team lose.\n\nNumbner 3.5: There are as many AFKers as people that leave too.\n\nOnce again, have a penalty for AFKing, or make it easy to report these players\n\nNumber 4: This game is no way worth the price it's being asked. It's a fun game, but not a $30 fun game.\n\nMaking this free to play with skin sales or making it atleast $15 cheaper would make it worth it. At least what I'm shown isn't worth $30\n\nCurrently playing the beta, I'm going to recommend this game as it is tons of fun as a free game and I completely respect that it's a game in beta. However if these issues aren't addressed, I can't recommend it. With all that said the biggest issue is the pricing point + the ingame marketplace where you must pay for skins. With that said, this game can be very interesting with time to come.","December 31, 2014","true","6.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jabutosama/recommended/299360/","jabutosama","WilleMaruz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jabutosama/","57 products in account","This game is FPS. If you are good at other FPS's, you are still nothing in this game.\n\n[h] What is this about? [/h]\n\nIt is about 5vs5 game where you usually want to destroy enemy core cube. There is 3 characters in free rotation, but total of 12 in total to play with in the moment I post this.\nYou can buy characters with either in-game money, which you get from playing game and once-a-day resetting small achivements, such as kill 3 brawn-class heroes or build 3 dynamite blocks. There is also this better money which you can buy with real money, which can be used also for purchasing heroes. Each class also has skins which you can buy with it, but real money makes you no better player than other.\n\nEach class is different, and by different I mean by A LOT different. Sniper can only fight seriously from range, ninja brutally murders anyone in melee range and engineer keeps itself alive with turrets. So this game has 12 heroes whose all have this much difference. But each class have blocks, the building is important for all classes. For engineer it is the whole life, but ninja needs ninja nests which he can teleport into with his ability and sniper again can build tiki towers which can work as personal defense, or for greater good, for defending the core. Build, Build, Build.\n\nThe video in startup of the game tells much. You have to watch it to understand many things in first place, but there is perfect line picked from there:\n\n"If you can't get there, go over it. If you can't get over, get under it. "\n\nThis game is about strategy. You have to plan how to defend, or you will lose. You will know how to counter a defense to win in first place. You need to know how classes work in order to do anything useful with them or even counter them. Killing only slows enemy team, but never stops them from acting.\n\nTo this all, you need to know how to shoot. It is important, but it only is only partion of total image.\n\nIn it's finest this game is a strategy game. I would say it to be mix of Minecraft, Team Fortress and League Of The Legends.\n\nTo make FPS gamers sad,\n[h]You need to know these to be good[/h]\n* how to defend\n* how to counter as many different defenses as possible\n* teamwork. TEAMWORK.\n* knowledge of all special blocks\n* know how to use class\n* know all the classes by look and voice, it it important\n* know how to counter any class\n\nIf this didn't scare you enough, well, I can't tell how this game works by typing letters here. You must see it.\n\n\nNot recommended for devoted CoD or CS players. Game is too complex. You need more than gun and reflexes.\n\nRecommended for Minecraft or Tf2 players. Game shares many core ideas like 3D building and required teamwork.\n\nMust-have for ones who would like to see Minecraft, Team Fortress and League Of The Legends together.","October 25, 2015","true","121.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

A gun that lobs mini shields that cover a small radius for a short while.If an ally is in it he will be shielded,if an enemy is inside he will receive damage.\nSecondary-Force gun.A gun that can attract or repel enemies.\nClass block-Shields(obviously).These shields are one sided and can soak up tons of damage.\nActive skill-Grants shields to allies in a certain area that soaks up a certain amount of damage before depleting.\nPassive skill-Part of damage taken is turned into health.\n\nThats all I can think of now.Hope the developers see this!\n\nEDIT:The hamster is a tad bit too OP.Should really nerf it.","October 9, 2015","true","17.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Is very fun and i would definetly tell my friends about this game. But one small problem. Prices of heroes (in coins, platinum is ok) is very high and overpriced, should be a little easier for newbies to get the heroes, by that, I don't mean Nigel, Tony, Sarge, Eliza, Juan or Cogwheel but heroes like Astrella, Science, Genie, Vandaar, Kira and Yuri, but other than that, the game is great!","October 28, 2015","true","140.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Figure I'd give this a try too.\n\n\nLaunch game. Get all set up with character and watch loading video. Hey, looks hopefull!\n\nClick lanch game.\n\n25 mins later it queus me into a group. Ok, new game with small playerbase I figure. Lets see how it plays.\n\nJoin ingame, figure out how to procede to gear out my character with zero instructions it gave before hand, not too bad you can figure it out I figure. Players start harrasing other players who couldent figure it out fast enough... Well, there are allways gonna be a**h**** in games, nothing new right?\n\nFinaly get in match. Start building up defences... Fall to my death because teammates are leveling everything.... Well, at least there is block physics right!?\n\nStart building again with bumpers to jump up high. Teammates start placing blocks to block bouncers....  ok..\n\nStart to play game, typical fast paced shooter. Nothing new or out of the "norm" of other games. Linear maps that force player interaction which is good.\n\nTeam gets rushed with in 2 mins. Surrender on screen and team surrenders. 25+ mins of waiting, over in under 8mins (including 5 mins of initial build time).\n\nGet to scoreboard. Figure, "Well, it was just a bad round, happens in anygame, lets try again!"\nOk, so how do we get into the next round? Looking... Looking... Looking.... Seeing everyone "discconect" one by one... Realize, you don't get another round! You don't requeue... Only one button, return to menu to start this "fun" series of events over from the begining....\n\nWell, that's enough of that. The way it seems now, this game is not gonna get enough player traction to go anywhere. Then, noticed the price they will try to sell this for... I would have been dissapointed at the $9.99 mark. But $30.00? WOWZA.\n\nGL to this game. In its current state, its gonna need all the luck it can get.\nFinal verdict. Get the beta for free and give it a try as long as you can bear it. Perhaps things will improve as time goes on, as is the point to Beta's.\n\nIf nothing changes... I wouldent even think of spending money on this.\n\n\n***TAKE 2***\nIf you would like to hear how the second round went, scroll to the top of this review and re-read.","February 25, 2015","false","1.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It was implemented a while ago that the game was free to play and after that is exploded. Essentially it is a online block based stratergy shooter game, It is a very broad game with about 14 hero`s to play as with different skins and abilities - so one hero will be right for you. You play in multiplayer and there is a chat and voice chat to communicate with fellow teammates and you can also play with steam friends. Overall you defend your base and attack the other team - sounds simple but hours of fun to be had. This is one of the best games ive found in steam that is free to play and several youtuber have played it - boosting its popularity. However theese things may avert you from the game for some people:\n-Purchases- You can buy things in game to get new heroes, skins and abilities.\n-Cube style graphics- If you dont like this style and flow of a game it may be a deterrant for you.\n-Trollers- Really this is anyones nightmare, in this game there are ways to break other peoples hard made defenses and even kill then which is very annoying, however you can report them and the Block N Load team are very supportive and helpful if there is any issues.\n\nThings I like:\n-Smooth gameplay- You dont need a high spec computer to play this, a regualr laptop will do fine.\n-Child freindly- No graphic voilence, blood or rude language, completely clean.\n-Variety- You can play as loads or hero`s and have different upgrades to add you own personal spin and skins to make characters look new. Also lots of maps to play.\n-Creators, welcome!- they have recently released a new editor map feature to allow people to customise their own maps and unleash them to the steam workshop for other to enjoy.\n-Play with friends- You can play with freinds you have on steam and freinds you have on the game itself. Also you can make a private game so only you and your freinds can join.\n-High quality sound effects and graphics- They sound quality is supoerb even on myu laptop speakers and the graphics are near the top for this new cube style.\n\nOverall this is an amazing game and everyone should try it. 10/10 from me.","December 26, 2015","true","174.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I mean the added extra stuff and they were keeping it in a pretty safe place. Now it's F2P and I don't think it's going to last a lot of time. I'm giving this a positive grade since the game was really good before F2P and I would love to see it leave the devastating F2P era. You can see from my hours that I do have some knowledge and I know the game well enough to judge it. No, I'm not buying platinum bars, I'm sorry but I bought the game when it was 13E so no, I'm not willing to give anymore money, instead give me the chars for free. I know that this F2P thing is to attract people but Jagex you already had the demo, wasn't this good enough?\nOverall this game was pretty ok, if they remove the F2P (which is obvi the same thing as the demo for people that didn't buy the game before + they have to spend 10E in order to buy 3 characters and also each one of the new chars costs 8E , *are you out of your mind?*) I think it's going to be more stable since it will attract back older audience.

Each week, three characters are free to play, and during that period, they cost less. Currently there is around 15 characters.\n\nThe gameplay is simple.Two teams of five, drafted with the matchmaking system od LoL.Few minutes when the teams are blocked from each other, this is the time to construct your defenses and set up a special offense strategy(like digging a straight tunnel right under the surface, just to place a respawn pad below the enemies base), then the game starts, time to shoot each other, destroy the enemies defense and base, while defending yours.\n\nYou need teamwork, much.Most people of the growing community understand that, but there are some kids raised on CoD and BF, who think their defense is supperior and everyone else just blocks them(some kid actually started remowing my turrets and radars from the places i placed them, just to get angry when i rebuilt them.), or think they will win the match by running and gunning(no, that does not work).\n\nThe graphics are good, for the style of the game, but it has pretty big requirements.The sounds are good.\n\nI have only encountered one bug, when i, with the sniper class killed 3 enemies in short range combat with my revolver, because i did'nt take any damage until i was in prone.\n\nYou get XP and money VERY slow, which might be annoying to some people.That goes for the game in overall, its kinda slow.\n\nThe devs are amazing, they give the players every opportunity to express their thoughts, and they actually listen.\n\nThere are some problems, like the game is very much based on offense right now, and there are some very OP ways to win(digging a tunnel, building over the map and stuff like that.\n\nSo thats it.A good but still developing game of its kind(compared to many abominations), with a developing community, some bugs, and somewhat high requrements.I would say its worth a shot, its free after all.Beause its still in development, this might change in the future, but right now this game is just amazing.\n\nI give this game 9.5/10.

Honestly, I find myself playing it more than any other game on my computer and I have at least 50. It doesn't take a high performance computer to play. I play it on my laptop with 40+ FPS.\n\nThere are interesting characters and skins. The many blocks, gadgets and defenses are absolutely awesome. There's a very tactical method to the game. If you just go in blindly shooting, you probably won't get far. A lot of the time you have to sacrifice kills for winning.\n\nOver-all, I love this game. A very beautiful blend of FPS and Minecraft (not in a bad way at all.) The only issue is some minor pay-to-win elements but it's nothing to be too concerned about. Just needs some balancing, in my opinion.","October 14, 2015","true","38.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It feels like Jagex realy took down the game's quality in an attempt to make this game more widely available. I mean, we used to have all heros and the only problem I can think of is a semi-long que time, not to mention the fact that most people had to pay $30 for this, and are only compensated with a $10 premium package. But with the addition of having to buy heros, perks, and other things, it seems that this once great game is going to freemium purgitory. However, the game is very innovative and fun, especialy if you're a fan of minecraft or TF2. overall, I would give this game a 7.8/10 for the new updates. Please Jagex, if your reading this, make some sort of change for everyone who is very dissapointed, who bought the game and are now disgraced by the fact that they have to share a que with unskilled free-to-play players who only make the game that much more frustrating. I would recomend something like a server for premium members, or even better, a remake of the origional.","October 1, 2015","true","90.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sure, some characters take time to learn, but the game is always about team effort and composition.\n\nThe stages are enjoyable, comprising of small ones with 1 cube to big ones with 3. A lot of them also have good spots for hiding e.g. respawn pads in enemy territory\n\nWhen it comes to matches, they always differ from one another; for example, I could end up with a bad team in one match, losing really badly, and suddenly have a skillful one in another, winning with a big margin.\n\nI'd say, this is one of the most unique FPS games I've seen.

I mean the added extra stuff and they were keeping it in a pretty safe place. Now it's F2P and I don't think it's going to last a lot of time. I'm giving this a positive grade since the game was really good before F2P and I would love to see it leave the devastating F2P era. You can see from my hours that I do have some knowledge and I know the game well enough to judge it. No, I'm not buying platinum bars, I'm sorry but I bought the game when it was 13E so no, I'm not willing to give anymore money, instead give me the chars for free. I know that this F2P thing is to attract people but Jagex you already had the demo, wasn't this good enough?\nOverall this game was pretty ok, if they remove the F2P (which is obvi the same thing as the demo for people that didn't buy the game before + they have to spend 10E in order to buy 3 characters and also each one of the new chars costs 8E , *are you out of your mind?*) I think it's going to be more stable since it will attract back older audience.

You get to use 3 characters for free, in a cycle (think league of legends). This doesn't do anything but make the characters you got good at disapear until they're back in the cycle or you buy them with either a) in game currency htat takes a while to earn or b) your own money. This is stupid. It doesn't add anything to the game and just messes up what could be a fun free-to-play game. I want free to play, not fee to pay.\n2) no single player with bots. this means if you have bad internet, don't buy this game.\n3) as of this review, there's only one main gamemode - classic, in which you defend your core and attack the other teams core. it need a capture the flag mode or something else to make the game better.\n4) respawn times feel a tad to long, with them being between 10-15 secconds usually, it rips you out of the action and makes you just sit there\n5) needs better server selection and more server capabilities. look at tf2 with its excess of server type, with different add-ons and plugins that make the game last a lot longer.\n6) skins can only be bought with real cash. your money takes ages to get anyways, let me buy a skin for my character\n\n\nall in all a decent free-to-play game that sadly falls flat 7.5/10, would reconmend but because its for free and has a decent concept behind it","October 24, 2015","true","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Different characters, different abilities, all having their own unique playstyle,movement animations,weight, size.  dialogue. which is something i find very refreshing when playing with some good friends with good team coordination.\n\nTeamwork, or atleast communication is absolutely essential for having an effective outcome and it encourages players to tailor their strengths to compensate the weaknesses of their teammates and vise versa. metas are starting to form and deform as this game gains new players everyday and its a thrill to observe.\n\nI highly recommend this game for anyone who likes to put their reflexes to the test aswell as their creativity.","October 20, 2015","true","151.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jabutosama/recommended/299360/","jabutosama","WilleMaruz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jabutosama/","57 products in account","This game is FPS. If you are good at other FPS's, you are still nothing in this game.\n\n[h] What is this about? [/h]\n\nIt is about 5vs5 game where you usually want to destroy enemy core cube. There is 3 characters in free rotation, but total of 12 in total to play with in the moment I post this.\nYou can buy characters with either in-game money, which you get from playing game and once-a-day resetting small achivements, such as kill 3 brawn-class heroes or build 3 dynamite blocks. There is also this better money which you can buy with real money, which can be used also for purchasing heroes. Each class also has skins which you can buy with it, but real money makes you no better player than other.\n\nEach class is different, and by different I mean by A LOT different. Sniper can only fight seriously from range, ninja brutally murders anyone in melee range and engineer keeps itself alive with turrets. So this game has 12 heroes whose all have this much difference. But each class have blocks, the building is important for all classes. For engineer it is the whole life, but ninja needs ninja nests which he can teleport into with his ability and sniper again can build tiki towers which can work as personal defense, or for greater good, for defending the core. Build, Build, Build.\n\nThe video in startup of the game tells much. You have to watch it to understand many things in first place, but there is perfect line picked from there:\n\n"If you can't get there, go over it. If you can't get over, get under it. "\n\nThis game is about strategy. You have to plan how to defend, or you will lose. You will know how to counter a defense to win in first place. You need to know how classes work in order to do anything useful with them or even counter them. Killing only slows enemy team, but never stops them from acting.\n\nTo this all, you need to know how to shoot. It is important, but it only is only partion of total image.\n\nIn it's finest this game is a strategy game. I would say it to be mix of Minecraft, Team Fortress and League Of The Legends.\n\nTo make FPS gamers sad,\n[h]You need to know these to be good[/h]\n* how to defend\n* how to counter as many different defenses as possible\n* teamwork. TEAMWORK.\n* knowledge of all special blocks\n* know how to use class\n* know all the classes by look and voice, it it important\n* know how to counter any class\n\nIf this didn't scare you enough, well, I can't tell how this game works by typing letters here. You must see it.\n\n\nNot recommended for devoted CoD or CS players. Game is too complex. You need more than gun and reflexes.\n\nRecommended for Minecraft or Tf2 players. Game shares many core ideas like 3D building and required teamwork.\n\nMust-have for ones who would like to see Minecraft, Team Fortress and League Of The Legends together.","October 25, 2015","true","121.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

It feels like Jagex realy took down the game's quality in an attempt to make this game more widely available. I mean, we used to have all heros and the only problem I can think of is a semi-long que time, not to mention the fact that most people had to pay $30 for this, and are only compensated with a $10 premium package. But with the addition of having to buy heros, perks, and other things, it seems that this once great game is going to freemium purgitory. However, the game is very innovative and fun, especialy if you're a fan of minecraft or TF2. overall, I would give this game a 7.8/10 for the new updates. Please Jagex, if your reading this, make some sort of change for everyone who is very dissapointed, who bought the game and are now disgraced by the fact that they have to share a que with unskilled free-to-play players who only make the game that much more frustrating. I would recomend something like a server for premium members, or even better, a remake of the origional.","October 1, 2015","true","90.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Nine characters, somewhere in the range of 15-20 maps, and each character also has a selection of different building blocks/traps/explosives/etc. they can pick from. Each match feels different due to the variety of approaches you can take such as tunneling underneath, planting a respawn pad behind your enemies base and having your entire team flank them, or just blowing everything up with a rocket launcher. The only downside is the small community, which makes it hard to learn or find tutorials on advanced techniques such as the best cutting locations for each map (where you cut the bottom blocks of a large structure to make it fall down and earn bonus blocks for your team).","June 27, 2015","true","78.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Another Minecraft clone?” which is what I first thought. At first glance, this game seems to lack any originality. It has voxel-based (cube) graphics, building and breaking, and guns. Be that as it may, I promise, if you play even ONE online game; you will experience the depth of the game. This game is in reality, a team oriented, hero-based, base-building, FPS. Your team of five is tasked with destroying the other team’s base, while at the same time, keeping them from destroying yours.

Another Minecraft clone?” which is what I first thought. At first glance, this game seems to lack any originality. It has voxel-based (cube) graphics, building and breaking, and guns. Be that as it may, I promise, if you play even ONE online game; you will experience the depth of the game. This game is in reality, a team oriented, hero-based, base-building, FPS. Your team of five is tasked with destroying the other team’s base, while at the same time, keeping them from destroying yours.

The community routinely bounces ideas off of them, and they very often implement their suggestions. If someone's OP, they fix it.\n\nAdditionally, each character has a serious amount of depth to them. Personally it's taken me dozens of games to get competent with a single character, and even then you still learn something new every game. Would definitely reccomend in its current state as a fast tactical shooter best enjoyed with friends.\n\n8.5/10","December 21, 2015","true","63.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Think Yetis, ninjas and scientists. The only disappointment i have is my rank being reset i went from silver 3 to bronze 5, but i'd like to stress this is not very common and i'm still the same level, so I don't realy mind. I have high hopes for this game as it's not a pay to win and i hope  it never will be.\n\nThe gameplay is superb, but each character has multiple playstyles and this takes getting used. My personal favourite is the  ninja "Juan" and i owe him my highest number of kills.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AppleArmy987/recommended/299360/","AppleArmy987","AppleArmy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AppleArmy987/","22 products in account","This is an absoulutely amazing game and I have locked around 107 hours on this - a must play. It was implemented a while ago that the game was free to play and after that is exploded. Essentially it is a online block based stratergy shooter game, It is a very broad game with about 14 hero`s to play as with different skins and abilities - so one hero will be right for you. You play in multiplayer and there is a chat and voice chat to communicate with fellow teammates and you can also play with steam friends. Overall you defend your base and attack the other team - sounds simple but hours of fun to be had. This is one of the best games ive found in steam that is free to play and several youtuber have played it - boosting its popularity. However theese things may avert you from the game for some people:\n-Purchases- You can buy things in game to get new heroes, skins and abilities.\n-Cube style graphics- If you dont like this style and flow of a game it may be a deterrant for you.\n-Trollers- Really this is anyones nightmare, in this game there are ways to break other peoples hard made defenses and even kill then which is very annoying, however you can report them and the Block N Load team are very supportive and helpful if there is any issues.\n\nThings I like:\n-Smooth gameplay- You dont need a high spec computer to play this, a regualr laptop will do fine.\n-Child freindly- No graphic voilence, blood or rude language, completely clean.\n-Variety- You can play as loads or hero`s and have different upgrades to add you own personal spin and skins to make characters look new. Also lots of maps to play.\n-Creators, welcome!- they have recently released a new editor map feature to allow people to customise their own maps and unleash them to the steam workshop for other to enjoy.\n-Play with friends- You can play with freinds you have on steam and freinds you have on the game itself. Also you can make a private game so only you and your freinds can join.\n-High quality sound effects and graphics- They sound quality is supoerb even on myu laptop speakers and the graphics are near the top for this new cube style.\n\nOverall this is an amazing game and everyone should try it. 10/10 from me.","December 26, 2015","true","174.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Firstly unlike a lot of free games here's no pay to win which will please lots of people everything is unlockable over time apart from the skins and cosmetics which you need real cash for. Paid players who bought the game before it was free get character unlocks and skins as a reward for buying the original. Block n Load in my opinion is in the top ten best free to play games on the Internet or Steam. It's primary a shooter but has some Minecraft building mechanics and 5v5 game play like a moba which I'll explain below.\n\nThis game is simple but great though you need to get through your first 20-25 matches before you start getting team mates who know how to play and want to improve and learn the meta. Early on people clearly have no idea how to play, they troll a lot and argue and make stupid decisions which lose matches quickly. Low level players think they are playing team deathmatch game and generally do stupid ♥♥♥♥ so expect 10 hours of frustration before the game comes into it's own.\n\nOnce you hit match 25+ or above half of those lowbies carry on playing and get better and the others leave. Things get very fun once the competitive players remain and only the core community who understand the game are left.\n\nMatches in general can last between 10-30 minutes and some occasionally an hour when teams are very well matched on the bigger maps. I love jumping on with a friend or two and found teaching new friends to play was nice and easy as there's a tutorial video and you can make custom games. What I enjoy most about Block N Load is some games are a long tactical slog where as others are rush rush rush and lots of killing and carnage with a quick win or defeat. One match you might be dug in on a stale mate and others you push early and gain the upper hand for a quick victory.\n\nBlock N Load certainly feels like a moba mixed with shooter mechanics and Minecraft block placement. It's matches feature 5v5 gameplay, choice of loadouts, cool skins and there is a kind of meta for each champ some are attacking and others defending play styles. There isn't any minions or skill trees like you'd get in a moba but your base is effectively the nexus or objective.\n\nAs you can see from the pics and vids it uses Minecraft like voxel graphics and engine which suits it nicely. It runs very well and is stable I never experience disconnection from their servers or get lag at all I've played ona 4mb connection and my home 70mb fibre. The combat is first person shooter like where you shoot other players with a small selection of weapons and fit out your character with perks and building objects but the moba element is basically two teams attack and defend each others cubes (Nexus) trying to destroy it to win.\n\nThink DOTA/LOL but without minions, no buffs and there's no number based combat or pointing and clicking.\n\nJust a side note I have never ever seen a hacker on this game either!\n\nSo basically to explain a match or the core game play a you get a build phase/resource gather phase which is normally 5 minutes to prepare your cube defence. After that a shield wall goes down and you battle until one team loses all their cubes (some maps have more than one).\n\nThere's not much else to say it's build then fight and then either win or lose. Games can be pretty intense and action happening all the time. My only complaint is the game should force at least one player to play an engineer or defensive class as sometimes you can lose a match in character select and build phase if no one on your team can build decent walls, traps or turrets.\n\nThe game can be won or lost in hero selection and in build phase if a player disconnects or leaves they are replaced very quickly, this is a great feature.\n\nBlock n Load is the best voxel based builder and shooter game out there!","September 18, 2015","true","163.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its a great game to play with your friends. If you want to have fun and just mess around and build i dont recommend this game for you but if you want to get competitive and work as a team to win this is a perfect game to you. Some people think of Minecraft the first time they see it, why you wonder? Probably beacuse you use blocks and you build with them. Minecraft and Block n Load are like two different worlds. Minecraft go creative do whatever you want. In Block n Load you can be very creative but in a different way. Maybe in minecraft you build a really nice castle you and your pigs can live in while in Block n Load you build a strategic base with maybe cool traps and defences. Before you buy Block n Load you probably wanna find somone to play with. It can get a bit repetitive at some times but there are many different maps and actully alot of events with maps and new playable characters in a limited time. Dont judge from if i do a thums down or thumbs up. I recommend the game to people who like strategic, "creative" and wants a game to play with your friends :).","May 11, 2015","true","389.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not sure the $30 price will ever be justified based on what I've seen. Even $20 is steep imo. Gifted by a friend, can't say I would've bought it.\n\nNow onto the game. Don't let the animation fool you, this game's not just for kids. There are tons of different strategies you can use and the different classes make for a relatively fresh experience everytime you play. Especially when you have 5 people who have half a clue what to do, it can be very fun. But....\n\n- needs a TON of balance work\n- you can just play as Sarge and spam rockets to win\n- the tank class isnt even a tank (a mortar cant blow up a sandbag?)\n- the ninja can spam endless throwing stars\n- you can't leave a match\n- achievements are bugged\n- you can't votekick or replace a player, so an afk usually means a loss\n- no voice chat, super important for a game like this\n- too many viable cheap, trolling options for easy, boring victories\n- map design in general needs work, and more maps added\n\nI understand the game isn't fully released yet, and hopefully the game has an active dev team that is aware of most of this. I could certainly sink some hours into this game.\n\nI'd say keep an eye on it, and look for updates/reviews.

All these people giving it negitive reviews, complaining about queue times, you have to remember that the game isnt released, its not the devs fault if there arent a lot of people playing. At the end of the day, i really enjoy this game, its true every game is different. It totally reshapes your thought process, it is something that we havent seen executed well, and i think it has a lot of potential.

Not sure the $30 price will ever be justified based on what I've seen. Even $20 is steep imo. Gifted by a friend, can't say I would've bought it.\n\nNow onto the game. Don't let the animation fool you, this game's not just for kids. There are tons of different strategies you can use and the different classes make for a relatively fresh experience everytime you play. Especially when you have 5 people who have half a clue what to do, it can be very fun. But....\n\n- needs a TON of balance work\n- you can just play as Sarge and spam rockets to win\n- the tank class isnt even a tank (a mortar cant blow up a sandbag?)\n- the ninja can spam endless throwing stars\n- you can't leave a match\n- achievements are bugged\n- you can't votekick or replace a player, so an afk usually means a loss\n- no voice chat, super important for a game like this\n- too many viable cheap, trolling options for easy, boring victories\n- map design in general needs work, and more maps added\n\nI understand the game isn't fully released yet, and hopefully the game has an active dev team that is aware of most of this. I could certainly sink some hours into this game.\n\nI'd say keep an eye on it, and look for updates/reviews. Personally I wouldn't pay $20-30 for it right now.","December 29, 2014","true","14.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I think one of the most important things to remember about this game is that it is in beta, sure there are glitches and problems, but thats why you are playing a game in beta, thats why it isnt released. All these people giving it negitive reviews, complaining about queue times, you have to remember that the game isnt released, its not the devs fault if there arent a lot of people playing. At the end of the day, i really enjoy this game, its true every game is different. It totally reshapes your thought process, it is something that we havent seen executed well, and i think it has a lot of potential.

Shooting and movement interaction is somewhat unique, you can move across map and up ledges very rapidly though you move very slowly while actively shooting, seems to simultaneously make positioning very important for the shooter while allowing enough fast movement for others to close into better range quickly, and also allowing for rapid escapes.  Its somewhat unique but i think the system works well here.\n\nEven if not a shooter player at all, the building portion of game is just as important, and you could just focus on mining / setting traps and not fire a gun all match and still be pretty helpful to your team.\n\n","May 4, 2015","true","863.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You can lock down a custom mode game with a friend(s) and train or strategize your gameplay for Casual or Ranked modes.\n\nMultiplayer - Lots of fun with a decent group of people (or at least a group that's forgiving/helpful and not jumping down your throat). Games start pretty quickly in the Casual mode but the new Ranked mode takes up to 30 minutes to get a game together. Hopefully that is resolved with more people playing this game. Built-in voice chat that works fairly well too.\n\nMaps - Quite a few maps to choose from and battle on. A good variation with all sorts of stategies for each and more maps being added fairly frequently.\n\nHeroes - Fun to play and a playstyle for anyone. More heroes being added and they've been very well balanced. There's no set team and most times you can play what you want with hurting the team too much. Communication is key; type or speak call outs and strategy in-game.\n\nOverall - I love this game. Great game, very addicting gameplay. So much fun to strategize building your defensive (and offensive) blocks then go after their cubes (bases). If you're looking for a comparison, as most posts claim, Minecraft combined with Team Fortress 2. I bought the skin pack purely to help the developers out and get more people playing this game. I suppose the skins are kinda cool too. =P\n\nIf you pick up the game, feel free to add me if you're looking for a buddy to group with.

Add on some strategy for the icing on the cake, and you've got Block n' Load.\n\nThe game stays true to the "No game's the same" line, as every time the teams are different, and thusly the strategies change from map to map and team to team.  One time, I played against a five-player team made entirely of Cogwheels.  Other times, the teams can be perfectly balanced and equally matched to the point of one destroying the other's cube as they watch their own cube blowing up.  We BOTH lost!\n\nThe controls and climbing can and probably will feel clunky to dedicated FPS players, as they're a bit odd.  Optimization COULD use some work, but it was made with Unity, which is not brilliant for optimization.\n\nAll in all, I would recommend for anyone who wants something a little different in the FPS department.\nTony and Nigel FTW!\n\n(Sidenote: This is my first Jagex game, I cannot really give a yay or nay about them since I haven't been around for them ruining Ace of Spades and other stuff I hear them getting ragged on about.)","May 11, 2015","true","110.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

I do recommend this game to all the people who are thinking if to buy it or not.\nThe best is to play with friends or people from forums, who are up to speak on teamspeak or other talking program for the best results !\nThis game requires teamwork and each 6 characters (1 will come out soon, 2 in the future) should communicate with each other and support with its tool, special abilities and other ways, so you should choose 5 people team carefully ! For each map you should choose different tactics if to dig under and blow up the base - or try to infiltrate and create spawning points at the back of the enemy base and rush the cube !\nReally nice gameplay, easy to play, requires the strategy and coordination together with other team mates.

Well i say NO game is EVER the same. TF2 is a gem and games that say they are like tf2 are just saying they a multiplayer objective based FPS with a cartoony style. TF2 is so much more than this, you could give a thousand more tags.\n\nThis is not minecraft ethier, minecraft has a very strong indie style and is very customisable, this game just uses the block mechanic and there are a thousand games that do also.\n\nSo what makes Block N Load not like any other game, it's because of its way if posing the matches, the way you have a build time and you need to defend and attack .\n\nBut what some people may criticise but i think is what makes the game awesome is gold system and the way you buy heros and level up and get perks, if these systems weren't in place i would have played 1 round and went, this is because i play to level up and get enough gold to get the next hero or a new perk it's great and keeps you coming back for more because when you unlock a new hero it's not like you got a new skin or new rank you now have a WHOLE NEW playstyle to play around with.\n\nI love this game and unlike most new multiplayer FPS’s there's always a match running for you to jump right into. Download for FREE now and make sure you block and load.\n\nHave fun!!\n\n\n\n","October 27, 2015","true","35.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

I do recommend this game to all the people who are thinking if to buy it or not.\nThe best is to play with friends or people from forums, who are up to speak on teamspeak or other talking program for the best results !\nThis game requires teamwork and each 6 characters (1 will come out soon, 2 in the future) should communicate with each other and support with its tool, special abilities and other ways, so you should choose 5 people team carefully ! For each map you should choose different tactics if to dig under and blow up the base - or try to infiltrate and create spawning points at the back of the enemy base and rush the cube !\nReally nice gameplay, easy to play, requires the strategy and coordination together with other team mates.

Shooting and movement interaction is somewhat unique, you can move across map and up ledges very rapidly though you move very slowly while actively shooting, seems to simultaneously make positioning very important for the shooter while allowing enough fast movement for others to close into better range quickly, and also allowing for rapid escapes.  Its somewhat unique but i think the system works well here.\n\nEven if not a shooter player at all, the building portion of game is just as important, and you could just focus on mining / setting traps and not fire a gun all match and still be pretty helpful to your team.\n\n","May 4, 2015","true","863.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I've also been on the losing end of those moves haha.

Then soon after, the free to play update came out. I did not care much for the update but what got me was the poor amount of compensationt hey gave for people. Instead of letting us still get all current and future heroes they give us a skin pack and tell us we now need to purchase future heroes. A skin pack does not compensate the amount spent to pay for it. What makes things worse is this attracted the FTP crowd of children that make communities so much worse. These kids jump on anything they can find that looks good and is free to play and just make the community ♥♥♥♥. For example now instead of balanced teams which were easy to coordinate with reasonable people everyone wants to be the sniper and God help you if you try to tell them otherwise. Kids like snipers kids want to be mlg so they pick the kit they think will make them mlg. These kids focus on setting up their little bases to camp and snipe from mostly leaving the core exposed. 90% of games I have played the only person building defenses was me. I would also like to add the complete lack of looking for the objective as all these kids do is go off on their own and try to get as many kills as possible. It almost feels like there is no objective at all other than shoot the enemy snipers. The only way to counter this stupid strategy is to dig under the map and crawl your way to the cores which they NEVER try to defend. This game used to be fun with mutual defensive builds and tactics to get in but now its just dig under the snipers and win this game quickly turned from fun action to how much longer am I going to dig my way through this game. I am extremely disappointed the way the developers screwed over everyone that supported the game when they paid for it and let the community fall to the FTP kids that kill all FTP communities. If you want to play this game anyway after reading the review I recommend planetside 2, first person shooter in which people actually DEFEND THE BASES AND PUSH AT APPROPRIATE TIMES. the kits are also free so save the grind.","November 9, 2015","false","6.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

The digging and building both work very well, and the shooting is fun. I don't think the shooting is anything revolutionary, but it's not bad by any means. The classes feel relatively balanced.\n\nAdding minecraft mechanics to a shooter doesn't actually add too much. It's an interesting concept, but there really isn't much it adds in terms of strategy (and it adds very little to shooting). There needs to be so much more done to really be tactical and deep.\n\nThis game does all those things needed. While the game may only look like a shooter with minecraft mechanics, it uses those mechanics and many others to create a game all about tactics, resource management, and most of all deception.\n\nThat's a very nice summary, but explaining why the game is about those things can't be done in a paragraph. The objective in this game is to defend your team's cube while destroying the enemy cube. There are so many strategies that both sides can use.\n\nMaybe you'll charge in and try to hit their cube with your shovel, maybe they'll have mines waiting for you. Maybe they'll dig under your base and try to disarm your traps, maybe you'll see them on your radar (which you have to set up, and can be destroyed) and dig down to them and throw some grenades in their tunnel. Maybe you'll try and sneak behind their enemy lines and set up a spawner so you can attack from a better angle, maybe they'll use radar to find and destroy it. Maybe they'll put down radars on your base to try and find your radars, and destroy yours, or you'll see them and stop them. Maybe you'll have a teammate set up some mortars and try to get close to call in a mortar strike on their defenses, maybe they'll send in a teammate to find and destroy the mortars. Maybe you'll build a bridge in the sky above their defenses, put a bomb down, and then destroy the block under it so it falls, maybe they'll dig out whatever's supporting your skybridge before that happens (blocks can't just float like in minecraft, they'll basically ragdoll if they're not attached to the ground at least through some other blocks touching it).

The digging and building both work very well, and the shooting is fun. I don't think the shooting is anything revolutionary, but it's not bad by any means. The classes feel relatively balanced.\n\nAdding minecraft mechanics to a shooter doesn't actually add too much. It's an interesting concept, but there really isn't much it adds in terms of strategy (and it adds very little to shooting). There needs to be so much more done to really be tactical and deep.\n\nThis game does all those things needed. While the game may only look like a shooter with minecraft mechanics, it uses those mechanics and many others to create a game all about tactics, resource management, and most of all deception.\n\nThat's a very nice summary, but explaining why the game is about those things can't be done in a paragraph. The objective in this game is to defend your team's cube while destroying the enemy cube. There are so many strategies that both sides can use.\n\nMaybe you'll charge in and try to hit their cube with your shovel, maybe they'll have mines waiting for you. Maybe they'll dig under your base and try to disarm your traps, maybe you'll see them on your radar (which you have to set up, and can be destroyed) and dig down to them and throw some grenades in their tunnel. Maybe you'll try and sneak behind their enemy lines and set up a spawner so you can attack from a better angle, maybe they'll use radar to find and destroy it. Maybe they'll put down radars on your base to try and find your radars, and destroy yours, or you'll see them and stop them. Maybe you'll have a teammate set up some mortars and try to get close to call in a mortar strike on their defenses, maybe they'll send in a teammate to find and destroy the mortars. Maybe you'll build a bridge in the sky above their defenses, put a bomb down, and then destroy the block under it so it falls, maybe they'll dig out whatever's supporting your skybridge before that happens (blocks can't just float like in minecraft, they'll basically ragdoll if they're not attached to the ground at least through some other blocks touching it).

TL/DR: Buy it if you're a casual gamer, but if you hate the thought of losing through things which aren't necessarily your fault, this isn't for you.\nFirstly, there are many positive attributes to this game. These are: a good blend between building and combat, with what ultimately feels like two substantial halves, some good map diversity, and an enjoyable experience that can either end in 5 minutes of mayhem, or 30 minute long sieges with ridiculous defense lines. Both of these present their own challenges, and ultimately enjoyable experiences.\nHowever, the game falls down in both its players and design elements. Firstly, I have found the community to be less than helpful, with toxic players often weighing down games. Beyond this, a lack of rating results in you often being saddled with players far below the average level. Characters suffer from being unbalanced, and the game itself has issues with queue times and a limited pool of players.\nI think this game has potential to evolve into something great, and would personally say buy it, but given Jagex's record, dont expect them to listen to community advice anytime soon.

If you are a competitive person like myself, you will have a hard time enjoying this game. Also there are many people that just spam the chat since there are no restrictions. Once again if you are competitive like me - I hate to lose lol - then you might have a hard time enjoying this. I do really like the game, and think that when it grows and gets more people above the age of 12 then I will enjoy it more, however at the moment it is either AFK's, people that have no idea that there is even another team, and spammers. I recommend it because I see the potential that it has and can't wait for a little bit better community.","December 17, 2014","true","24.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Plus, people who payed for the game don't get any new characters, (Yuri, Kira Chan, Kreepy, etc.)\n\nGold and Platinum are the stupidest things ever... That's all I have to say about them.\n\nTHE SERVERS ARE HORRIBLE, I GET CONSTANT LAG SPIKES AND HIGH PING.\n\nDon't even get me started on character balance...\n\nThose are just a few of the reasons that I feel ruined the game.\nThis is all my opinion so don't flip out.\n\nTL;DR: the devs ruined the game and unless they fix it, I'm not changing my review.","March 29","false","41.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","4","7","3","3"

To get this!\n\nThis game is made purely for the enjoyment factor. You build, destory, defend, and attack. Each character has their own special loadout to take with them. Plus the tutorial is very simplistic and easy to understand.\n\nIf this game does support gamepad (Which i think it does, i could be wrong) i highly recommend getting a gamepad controller it will make using the controls a lot more eaiser.\n\nI recommend it.","April 30, 2015","true","0.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","5","9","2","0"

Plus, people who payed for the game don't get any new characters, (Yuri, Kira Chan, Kreepy, etc.)\n\nGold and Platinum are the stupidest things ever... That's all I have to say about them.\n\nTHE SERVERS ARE HORRIBLE, I GET CONSTANT LAG SPIKES AND HIGH PING.\n\nDon't even get me started on character balance...\n\nThose are just a few of the reasons that I feel ruined the game.\nThis is all my opinion so don't flip out.\n\nTL;DR: the devs ruined the game and unless they fix it, I'm not changing my review.","March 29","false","41.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","4","7","3","3"

I remember when I used to play Ace of Spades, before Jagex bought the rights to it. I loved that damn game! I was REALLY bummed out that the creator, Ben Akoroy or something like that, decided to sell it to the ♥♥♥♥♥iest company that he could think of. How could you put so much time and work in to the game, only for it to be wasted and absorbed in to the trash heap, and then use the same game, only now it's covered in dog crap? I can confess, I was not thinking of the amount of things that Jagex ♥♥♥♥ed up, RuneScape, and now AoS. Even if you liked the new AoS, who the hell were you gonna play with? Servers on that game were empty, and now it's even MORE empty! I bet I can't even find ONE damn server that doesn't have the game mode "Classic" or "Zombies", and is full! Yeah, that's how much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t I put up with Jagex. Fortunately, I don't have to put up with that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t anymore.\n\nSUMMARY: Good game, has several bugs, but these can be easily fixed with a build or two.\n\nPROS: Great idea, good elements (Blocks, traps, etc.), very fun as it's never possible to have a perfect building strategy, and as it states,  "No games the same".\n\nCONS: Few bugs, voice actor is not bad, but could be SO much better.\n\n8/10\n\n- The Nerd","December 15, 2014","true","5.1"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

I remember when I used to play Ace of Spades, before Jagex bought the rights to it. I loved that damn game! I was REALLY bummed out that the creator, Ben Akoroy or something like that, decided to sell it to the ♥♥♥♥♥iest company that he could think of. How could you put so much time and work in to the game, only for it to be wasted and absorbed in to the trash heap, and then use the same game, only now it's covered in dog crap? I can confess, I was not thinking of the amount of things that Jagex ♥♥♥♥ed up, RuneScape, and now AoS. Even if you liked the new AoS, who the hell were you gonna play with? Servers on that game were empty, and now it's even MORE empty! I bet I can't even find ONE damn server that doesn't have the game mode "Classic" or "Zombies", and is full! Yeah, that's how much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t I put up with Jagex. Fortunately, I don't have to put up with that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t anymore.\n\nSUMMARY: Good game, has several bugs, but these can be easily fixed with a build or two.\n\nPROS: Great idea, good elements (Blocks, traps, etc.), very fun as it's never possible to have a perfect building strategy, and as it states,  "No games the same".\n\nCONS: Few bugs, voice actor is not bad, but could be SO much better.\n\n8/10\n\n- The Nerd","December 15, 2014","true","5.1"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

But again, it's in beta so you have to expect it to be under optimized and unbalanced. I usually play as Nigel, the Sniper and I find that his primary weapon (Nellie) is very underpowered. I also feel that the Ninja (O.P. Juan Shinobi) is way too overpowered as it two hit kills (and sometimes one hit KOs) most of the time and is very mobile. So far from what I've observed, the community isn't too nice or educated about the game. Alot of people attack their teammates as they do not know that there is "Friendly Fire" and they destroy their own bases and do not know the actual objective of the game. I feel that the game is poorly optimized (in terms of smoothness and FPS rate) but of course, it is a beta. One thing I hope that does not happen is a pay to play or pay to win game, in which you need to buy the game (although I may buy it - if the game is updated and new content is added that makes me want to constantly play the game) or pay for microtransactions to gain an overpowered ability in the game.\n\nAll in all, it's a good game but it still needs a lot of updating.

The servers are horrid. I had a 23 ping on the server (on average[US server]) and everyone else was lagging around like their getting their internet off of a dead raccoon.\n\nThe Balance: There basically is none. Leveling up grants you more power basically. So a new player will have no chance of beating a higher level player.  As you level up, you gain access to more abilities such as lower active cooldowns, more uses on your active ability, and so on. And not to mention that you have to be level 6 to get access to change what blocks you can use. That might not sound bad, but here's the thing, those blocks have more heal, plus there's an actual bomb that you can use to destroy blocks. You'd figure that everyone would have acccess to it, right? Nope, you have to be level 6 to get it.\n\nBut wait, there's more. One would think that if you're new, you'd go against other new players, right? Wrong, you get thrown in with higher levels, so have fun trying to play a game where everyone who's played longer has abilities to destroy you instantly.\n\nThe "heroes": They're okay at best, but the only way you can do anything to kill enemy heroes is pay to get better ones.\n\nOn the topic of paying: The game has a P2W (Pay to win) system. You can pay for new, powerful heroes that will just destroy everyone else and there's nothing you can do about it. The IGC (In Game Currency) you get is literally nothing after any match making it so you have to literally grind the hell out of the game to even afford someone new to play. Yes there is a free rotation, but you still have to buy someone to play as no matter what (unless you wanna live off the rotation for the rest of your life).\n\nLast words: The game it's self is an "ok" game, it's just that all the bull ♥♥♥♥ that they just packed in makes it literally unenjoyable to play. The leveling system breaks it, the pay-for-perks system breaks it more, and the heroes that just destroy everyone else just puts the final nail in the coffin.\n\nA game may only be as good as the player, but when the game has too many broken aspects, the game is the bad one, not the player.","November 6, 2015","false","1.0"," 13 of 25 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","13","25","0","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Doa_Gaming/recommended/299360/","Doa_Gaming","Legendary Matt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Doa_Gaming/","118 products in account","I had the opportunity to play this game at RuneFest, a convention for RuneScape which is one of Jagex's most-known achievements in its game history, before it was even mentioned to the public. Right then I knew it would be a fun and casual game and not something that requires too much time.\n\nThe concept is brilliant and the amount of teamwork needed makes it a great game to play with friends. Alternatively, this also leaves you prone to being teamed up with people who could care less and just do their own thing. Luckily, I haven't experienced the latter and have actually seen a good amount of willingness to teach and help players that are newer to the beta.\n\nThe only concern I have is that Jagex is going to be charging a price for this game according to the description. If this is the case, this game will fail, just as the several games that Jagex has tried to make before it. There is no way I would pay more than $5 to play this game the way it is. It's too simple and too casual to invest more than that. If you want to gain $$$ then add skins (like you are doing) and possible even characters but try to stay away from pay-to-win mechanics (which unfortunately you are also known for in RuneScape, your most successful game).\n\ntl;dr Not worth paying more than $5 for, a fun and casual game, has potential, hopefully Jagex gets it right this time.","December 17, 2014","true","4.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's really good that you can select your blocks instead of giving different blocks on different classes. For an early acces game i give it 9/10. Got it for free and also played with the developer.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Doa_Gaming/recommended/299360/","Doa_Gaming","Legendary Matt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Doa_Gaming/","118 products in account","I had the opportunity to play this game at RuneFest, a convention for RuneScape which is one of Jagex's most-known achievements in its game history, before it was even mentioned to the public. Right then I knew it would be a fun and casual game and not something that requires too much time.\n\nThe concept is brilliant and the amount of teamwork needed makes it a great game to play with friends. Alternatively, this also leaves you prone to being teamed up with people who could care less and just do their own thing. Luckily, I haven't experienced the latter and have actually seen a good amount of willingness to teach and help players that are newer to the beta.\n\nThe only concern I have is that Jagex is going to be charging a price for this game according to the description. If this is the case, this game will fail, just as the several games that Jagex has tried to make before it. There is no way I would pay more than $5 to play this game the way it is. It's too simple and too casual to invest more than that. If you want to gain $$$ then add skins (like you are doing) and possible even characters but try to stay away from pay-to-win mechanics (which unfortunately you are also known for in RuneScape, your most successful game).\n\ntl;dr Not worth paying more than $5 for, a fun and casual game, has potential, hopefully Jagex gets it right this time.","December 17, 2014","true","4.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Imagine if you take the previous game, actually have a reason to build due to the build up round, have the classes system from Team Fortress 2 and quite a few block puns. The only thing that may turn you off is probably the £23 price tag since as of this review there's not exactly much in the game but this was only the beta i've played so it may change once the full game releases.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Doa_Gaming/recommended/299360/","Doa_Gaming","Legendary Matt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Doa_Gaming/","118 products in account","I had the opportunity to play this game at RuneFest, a convention for RuneScape which is one of Jagex's most-known achievements in its game history, before it was even mentioned to the public. Right then I knew it would be a fun and casual game and not something that requires too much time.\n\nThe concept is brilliant and the amount of teamwork needed makes it a great game to play with friends. Alternatively, this also leaves you prone to being teamed up with people who could care less and just do their own thing. Luckily, I haven't experienced the latter and have actually seen a good amount of willingness to teach and help players that are newer to the beta.\n\nThe only concern I have is that Jagex is going to be charging a price for this game according to the description. If this is the case, this game will fail, just as the several games that Jagex has tried to make before it. There is no way I would pay more than $5 to play this game the way it is. It's too simple and too casual to invest more than that. If you want to gain $$$ then add skins (like you are doing) and possible even characters but try to stay away from pay-to-win mechanics (which unfortunately you are also known for in RuneScape, your most successful game).\n\ntl;dr Not worth paying more than $5 for, a fun and casual game, has potential, hopefully Jagex gets it right this time.","December 17, 2014","true","4.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

In the preparation phase, you only have so long, and need to hurry. In the actual battle, you won't even have that luxury, you'll be building walls, placing bombs, and even establishing a forward base as bullets fly overhead and artillery is tearing apart the world around you, and you'll never know whether or not someone might sneak up on you while you're building and knock your block off (pun intended).\nAs soon as the game's free to play time was up, I immediately purchased it and haven't looked back.\nThe only major problem with the game I've encountered is the fact that my account is level 90 (currently the level cap) and can still get paired with four level 0s, which means certain defeat for your team no matter how good you are. This could be easily fixed by only pairing people of similar skill levels, though the exact method would be up to Jagex.\nUnlike what many others have said, I have to disagree with the opinions on the overall community. Though there are plenty people who take me back to my Modern Warfare days, it's pretty tolerable, and not TOO common for me to make any major complaints. It could use some improvement, but so long as you're not too thin-skinned, you should be fine for the most part.\n\nI'd highly recommend this game to most everyone, and will continue to play, myself.","June 27, 2015","true","666.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"
