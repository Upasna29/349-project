On the way she finds a pretty bad damaged camper but it does not look like an accident. You watch for survivors and you find a little girl who is talking about a „monster“ and that she misses her mom. Shortly after a big crow is attacking you and takes the girl with her. Shocked and confused you decided to save her and her parents and you start your journey through the mysterious Ravenwood Park next to the camper.\n\nLike a detective you have to find hints and to solve puzzles. You have to find your way through 55 beautiful and spooky locations. You can collect your hints on a blackboard (which is really well drawn with handwritten notes). Besides there are also other small objects you have to find for some achievements. Oh yeah there are 36 achievements and they are not that hard to get. So it’s a good game for achievement hunters! :p If the puzzles are too easy for you, of course you can choose a higher level of difficulty.\n\nReally the story is so exciting that I found myself actually wanting to solve the mystery and I couldn’t stop playing it! The graphic is really good and I enjoyed watching the cutscenes + scenaries. Also the music is well chosen for the locations and gives always the right feeling.\n\nSo all in all the game is totally worth the money and I highly recommend this game for everyone who enjoys spooky games, good animations and who is interessted in an exciting story!","June 16, 2014","true","10.5"," 47 of 48 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","47","48","0","5"

Once I started the game I had no intention of sitting there for the 4 hours that I did. I found it kinda relaxing and the story was actually decent. I found myself actually wanting to solve the mystery and paying attention to the story. The puzzles aren't extremely hard and there is a casual mode if you are having trouble. The graphics were decent in the cutscenes and sceneries and the voice acting was even played out pretty well. All in all I enjoyed it and am getting ready to play the new part I just unlocked.

Enigmatis 2: The Mists of Ravenwood is quite the treat, vastly improving in many areas from the first game in this series, and adding even more goodies to give a unique flavor to this game.\n\n=Complete Review=\n\n=The Story: 4/5= Once again, I can't say too much about it so as to not spoil it. However, what I can say is that it certainly expands greatly upon the story and background of the first game. Giving you insight in to what the purpose of the murders are. You start off two years after the first game, hunting down a lead for the culprit from the last case, only to find yourself attacked by a monstrous raven made of shadow and mist.\n\nThis time, unlike the last one where you had almost solved the mystery before you began, you start on square one in the thick of a supernatural mystery to be solved. With a mission to save the family of a little girl you witnessed being taken by the beast, you must use your wits, and your perception to find clues so as to find who's the culprit behind it all... And how to stop them before it's too late for the family.\n\nAnd, once again, like the last one, you get a bonus after you beat the first game, to get a glimpse in to the past of the life of a surviving victim of the tradgedy. I've yet to play this part myself, but if it's anything like the last game, it's definitely going to be a moving part of the story.\n\n=The User Interface: 4/5= Now, when I played the first game, I was left very impressed with the user interface. But, that's not to say that there wasn't flaws with the interface. However, in the sequel, it seems that those flaws have been taken care of. Not only that, but with the inclusion of new goodies to play with. The map is now separate from the journal, meaning you don't have to go through the journal to reach your map anymore, which did get annoying in the original.\n\nNot only that, the investigations board has definitely been improved, as you now have a mysterious friend to bounce ideas off of, and to discuss conclusions and thoughts to. Which also allows you to reach your friend easier to turn in pieces of a much bigger puzzle, to learn even more about the story.\n\n=The Gameplay: 4/5= The hidden object puzzles are a bit more interesting this time around, so to speak. With more involvement in putting things together to collect them, and putting things together to unlock other things you need. Which, it does give more gameplay for those who want more out of their HOG experience. Sadly, the hidden object scenes are a lot more scattered than the first. But there's a lot more puzzles and plot to make up for it.\n\nHowever, for those who are not exactly good at finding the objects, or get stuck, there's the option to play a pair-matching game instead to collect the items. Which does make things a bit easier if you have an item you just can't find, and you don't want to, or can't use a hint.\n\nThere are achievements for fully playing the game one way or the other, so if you're like me, and you like getting all the achievements in a game, you're gonna need to replay this one a couple times to get all the achievements, unlike in the first where I was able to get all the achievements in one solid run. Which, can be a good or bad thing, depending on your view.\n\nThe puzzles in this one are very nice, and there are maybe one or two that are sort of recycled from the first game, but it's done so in a way that makes sense for the game. The puzzles in here are pretty plentiful, and well done in my opinion. There are some that are definitely difficult as well, so be prepared to put your grey matter to use.\n\n=The Graphics: 4/5= Keeping in with the last game, the items are properly fixed on to the scene, looking like they actually belong in the same setting as the background. But, this time around, the graphic quality of the characters and cutscenes have improved a lot since the first game. Characters don't look quite as awkward when they are speaking, and characters actually move their head when they talk.\n\nThere are a couple problems though. Rarely, the characters mouth tends to look weird, and drop in quality when they are speaking, not as much as the first game though. Also a bit of a problem regarding the little girl's expression not always matching the situation at hand: Looking neutral/happy when she sounds worried, or is scared, so on and so forth. It's not a major issue, but it is something that could use a little polishing.\n\n=The Music: 2/5= Sadly, this is where I have to give a bad score. This is not because the music is bad, no. But because from what I can hear, most of it is recycled from the first game. There are some original scores in there, but the main themes are the recycled ones. But, it's not overly bad of a offense, considering that the music score of the original did well on setting the ambience of the game. Still enough that I'm gonna have to give a 2 for instead of a 3.\n\n=The Atmosphere: 4/5= The first one's atmosphere was amazing, and this one? It may not have the darker, doom and gloom look to start, but it definitely does a good job on making something feel 'wrong' with Ravenwood park. Don't take the first little segment of the park as the real deal, as things definitely get darker. Which matches the storyline pretty well in my opinion. Things do get quite a bit more creepy and gross in thisgame, and it has more jumpscares than the last, so it's definitely not for the ones who are for more lighthearted HOGs.\n\n=TL;DR/Pros & Cons=\n\nPros\n- Richer plot than the sequel.\n- Improved mechanics from the sequel.\n- More puzzles!\n- A new way to deal with Hidden Object Scenes.\n- More achievements!\n- Better graphics and cutscenes.\n\nNeutral\n- Achievements will require you to play at least twice through the whole game.\n- A different atmosphere that doesn't make it a 'cut and paste' of the sequel's style. Good or bad, depending on if you preferred the feel of the original.\n\nCons\n- New pair matching minigame takes away from the HOG concept.\n- Reused music from the first game.\n- A few errors with how the mouth looks when characters are talking.\n- A bit of overuse with some of the jumpscares.\n\n=The Conclusion: 8.5/10= The game is a great installment for it's genre, and is a lot more story-driven than the first game. I definitely would suggest this series, and this developer for those who like games of this genre! And I eagerly await the sequel to this game to know what happens next.\n\nThank you for your time, and for reading my review.","June 25, 2015","true","15.1"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","0"

For a puzzle game, I did not find it very challenging or frustrating, but that can be taken as a good thing for some. Overall it was a nice experience.\n\nHowever, on the note of the "horror" aspects of the game, I would say it's more along the lines of a "spooky" game rather than a "horror" game. Does that take anything away from the game? Not at all! I still found myself enjoying every minute of the creepy areas and little spooks that popped-up through my playthrough.\n\nMy only negative remarks are for the voice-acting and the facial animations. I feel like this could have done better with simple text and expressions rather than the acting and psuedo-animation. But I never felt drawn-out of the adventure because of them, so they should not be considered a deal-breaker.\n\nOverall an enjoyable game that I can easily recommend.","June 5, 2014","true","4.2"," 23 of 29 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","23","29","0","0"

I could also lock the inventory. Naaah - changed from 7 to 8! :)\n\nStory: 8 / 10 - slighty less interesting than the Maple Creek story (begging was amazing, the mid game poor and  end game - very good)\n\nMusic: 10 / 10 - this time it was pure perfection\n\nHOG: 4 / 10 - ... yea... One thing I could skip all HOGs and play some memory instead and the second - it was SUPER easy when I wanted to have a harder ones... This is a wrong direction :(\n\nPuzzles: 3 / 10 - I wish I could make it higher than before (4) because there were muuuuuchh more of them. Unfortunatelly - they were SUPER easy, instead of 2 maybe 3 of them which was average. Sum: +2 for amount, -3 for much easier tasks\n\nUsing items puzzles: 6 / 10 - again! I wanted to give more because there was much the puzzles of that kind and I felt much more joyfull solving them... But unfortunatelly - there were TOO many situations, where I had few items for prize / prise (~?) something (crowbars, knifes, sticks, brenches, etc.) but NOPE - YOU MUST DO IT WITH ANOTHER ITEM :I\n\nLocations: 5 / 10 - It started really good, oh man! Really really good! But more and more time I played it, it wasn't interesting, shocking or atmospheric for me. And most of the times - I didn't need to go back... :/ It was just move forward and forward...\n\nEnding: 10 / 10 - Shhh... It's a secret :) I can only tell this is a GOOD direction! :))\n\nProtagonist: 8 / 10 - YES! I demanded and I got it! In Ravenwood there is so many of our hero, so we can finally get to know here a little bit more! We could be her!\n\nLogic: 7 / 10 - it was ten minus two, for YOU MUST PRISE IT WITH ANOTHER KIND OF CROWBAR! and minus one for few little amuzing situations\n\nDuration: 8\n\nDLC: 4 / 10  - boring, boring and again - boring. Again it was short and had many HOGs inside, but I finished it just for sake of 100% completion and for ending expansion.\n\nAchievements: 5  - It was really hard to rate this detail. Collection illusions and butterflies was a challenging task.\nI don't know about butterflies, but illusions collection had at least one situation, where you could gather it only once per gameplay. Guess what - I missed one of them...\nThere were also a bad achievements. Like - complete the game second time to get them - I did the HOG ones first time so the second (and unwanted) playthrought was pointed towards memory-game cheevos. And my sad one illussion.\n\nImagine my frustration when I missed the one illusion at the begging, where there is no way to go back to that state.\nTHE DUCK!!\nI tried to start the story again - ... but I COULDN'T!!\nSo I created the another detective account~ and finish the game... second time... and hurray - I am still missing the one achievement - "collect all acheivement" one.\nDUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCCCKKKKKKKKKK!!!!\n\nFortunatelly - within my THIRD gameplay - I only needed to get memory (again..) and the one illusion I missed durning first playthrought.\n\nIn summarize of this damn achievements: I give it 10 and I give it 1. So let's say it is on 5.\n\nOverall: 86 / 130 (66%)\nPersonally I would give this game 60% too.\nIt would worth for me 70-75% in ratings, but because of my 100% completion addiction - I need to finish it 2 times (3 times... ) which was super frustrating...\nAnyway - I DO recommend it :)\nAnd I still can't wait for part 3 of the series! :>","April 13","true","13.2"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","17","19","0","0"

I bought a bundle with a bunch of them in it because the bundle was really cheap and I thought most of the games in it looked cool. I'm going to have to play through it twice more to get 100% (I kind of switched back and forth between hidden object and card matching the first time though) but that's okay. It's not going to be difficult to get 100%, as long as I play while I'm not distracted by screaming kids.\n\nSpeaking of kids, the boy enjoyed watching me play and he helped me with a couple of hidden object puzzles, so it was a pretty decent way to distract the kids, because Sunny got into watching me too.\n\nOverall, not a bad game, with good music and decent graphics, a decent storyline, and puzzles that weren't too easy or too difficult.

Believing the elusive Maple Creek Preacher is involved, she goes there.  While driving through a remote part of the redwood forest overlooking the coast she is nearly hit by a black cloudy flying "thing" before encountering what appears to be an accident scene involving a family camper.  No accident, as it turns out when the black cloudy raven with red glowing eyes attacks again to retrieve the girl child who escaped the first time.  Drawn both willingly and cautiously into the dark sinister world of Ravenwood Park, (most probably an unregistered and unheard of tourist stop about the past lumber industry), she once again encounters dark and evil forces at work as she thrives to rescue the captured family.  Old friends, new friends and a lethal enemy.  Be warned, friends are only enemies with mutual goals.\n\nGameplay: Hmmm....I must digress slightly here.  I will compare this to Enigmatis: Maple Creek first, since generally fans of a particular company will play the sequel (or more) even if they hated the previous game if they like the company that made it.  (Or there was spectacular advertising,)\nFirst of all Enigmatis: Ravenwood plays so much easier then Maple Creek.  Artifex Mundi turned the volume down on the horror and suspense but upped the creepy and supernatural elements, yet left all the mystery, anxiety and urgency.  Like that or not, this game is PG, not PG17, and I for one thank Artifex Mundi for doing this.  Even the few jump scares (mostly at the beginning) were not that bad.  Though I must say there were some truly terrifying and horrifying scenes in this game.\nThe second thing Artifex Mundi did was stop being "jerks" in the hidden object scenes.  ("Jerks" by my definition make find clues in hidden object scenes so hard or so obscure the find clue is nearly impossible to locate.) Thank you for that too.  Ravenwood plays like a dream compared Maple Creek in that aspect.\nThird thing:  There is a no-penalty fast travel map.  Thank you so much.\n\nNow just about Ravenwood, well almost, since it retains the same investigation "evidence board" as the first game.  The "evidence board" is where our detective places all the clues she finds and groups them together in circles concerning a certain subject like identity, location, crime, suspects, etc.  This is a clever mechanism for storytelling and informing the player what has been and still needs to be accomplished, as well as subtly reminding the player this woman is a resourceful detective.  (In my opinion she is just as resourceful as Macgyver.)  If this series continues, I do hope they continue using this play strategy, it is very different from other games.   One even gets an achievement for finding all the evidence, and another for conditionally placing it correctly.  Now that is clever.\n\nThe Hidden Object scenes vary from straight find lists with the added extra twist of locating the object first such as in a drawer or pouring a glass of wine from a bottle, to what I call shape picture puzzles.  (Those are the puzzles that show a shape that must be found first then used, such as the shape of a key which once found opens something.)  Not so easy to be simple (They did not overcompensate from Maple Creek.) but not so hard the gamer rage-quits either.  Just good even average on the difficulty level.\n\nThe actual puzzles are easy to understand and relatively challenging.  I do believe I noticed that as the game progressed the puzzle challenges slowly increased in difficulty as did actually finding all the pieces of the puzzle.  By the end of the game as the game scope narrows the player frequently has an empty or near empty inventory.  For me it increased the "felt" urgency as if I could actually be late and "not save day".\n\nThis game (probably due to the age) introduces the alternate hidden object play I have come to think of as one of Artifex Mundi's signatures.   Instead of doing the hidden object scene, one can play a matching game instead.  (This is Mahjong in the Nightmares from Deep series).  Unfortunately this also requires a second playthrough if achievement hunting.  I really wish Artifex Mundi (or any game developer for that matter that forces a second playthrough) allowed the other set of achievements (play all hidden object games or play all alternate games) to be gotten by the playing all the hidden object scenes in the extras as one or the other.\n\nThere are two sets of extra find objects.  One the "Illusion" objects that even though they fade in and out, do so rapidly and are quite large.  It is very hard to miss these.   The Illlusion changes from well maintained to decrepit abandonment, which is in keeping with the Ravenwood game theme.  These are kept track of in the notebook at the back, which is a very nice touch.  The second set are the "Ethereal Butterflies"  These are easier to miss 1) because they are smaller and 2) the gamer gets distracted.  Make sure to get them before moving on, there are one or two the gamer can not go back for.  These are not conveniently kept track of either.\n\nOverall, a good game and I hope the series continues since the ending was left open.","September 7, 2015","true","17.2"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

That's correct, in this game (in addition to the ability to outright skip puzzles) you can opt for a match-2 game if HOGs just aren't up your alley.  However, just comparing the two, it's clear that the devs put way more time and effort into the previous, seeing as each HOG is unique as well as visually pleasing, while the match 2 game is just the same exact game repeated ad nauseam.\n\nIn addition to that, almost every aspect of the game has improved from its predecessor.  Better voice acting, clearer interface, a nice extras/options menu, and MUCH better puzzles/deductions outside of the aforementioned HOGs/Match-2s.  The storyline is still pretty mediocre and as for the "plot twists", anyone with half a brain could forcast them from 10 minutes into the game.\n\nIf you're after some simple ol' sleuthing and hidden object finding, this game is probably one of the best of the market, as long as you don't expect a lot from a well-worn storyline.","December 15, 2015","true","17.9"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

However, a giant raven seems to be interested in you and in the little girl hidden in an trail involved in an accident. When you woke up, everything seems normal but after discovering a prisoner in Ravenwood, you're thrown back to a world of darkness...\n\nEnigmatis 2 is the follow-up of the events in Maple Creek, where you stopped a priest in his way to eternal life. However, Hamilton, the detective investigating his lover's disappearence since 30 years ago, disappeared with the dagger. Now, two years after, you're still searching for them, as you fear that the preacher will not stop and that Hamilton is still out for spilling his blood. However, here, you have to save a little girl and her parents from a terrible fate. A prisoner will help you in your deductions and tell you the story of these disappearances. The plot is well-written and because Ravenwood was released on Steam before Maple Creek, I hadn't any clue about the twists happening later because I didn't have these references. It means that Ravenwood works perfectly as a stand-alone and that you don't need the previous story to understand everything (in reality, in Ravenwood, you'll get the whole picture of the situation). Seeing how the plot ends, it's clear that it's missing a third chapter and I hope to see a sequel one day.\n\nAs for the gameplay, it's the standard one: use items, find them, clear hidden objects scenes, solve puzzles. However, in addition of that traditionnal gameplay, you can find for hidden objects scenes two ways to play them: shapes and words. Also, the return of the investigation board is also a nice way to keep being focused on the case and to unlock new objectives. Generally, these deductions will grant you more questions to ask to the prisoner and he will give you also items needed to advance. Finally, Enigmatis 2 doesn't suffer of a problem of navigation, like I had in Maple Creek. You don't have to fear a misclick now.\n\nThe graphics are also quite good. I really liked the switch between an illusion world and the reality. Too bad it's only happening once. But you can find leftovers of it thanks to objects changing forms in the scenes. And given the fact that you need to find them for an achievement, it's quite amusing to hunt them down. Another good idea was to make some statues "alive" (eyes moving, head turning, etc...) to strenghten the feeling of being watched, so that you're not at ease at all in this desolation. However, contrary to Maple Creek, which was a town, here, you're in a national park, surrounded by nature and cabins.\n\nThe soundtrack is as usual good and the voice acting is perfect. I've nothing to say there.\n\nSo in other words, Enigmatis 2 is an excellent casual adventure game, delivered by Artifex Mundi themselves. The game is really worthy of a purchase at full price but Artifex's games are often discounted in the weekly sale or in bundles. If you like their work, you'll love Enigmatis 2.","April 19","true","12.5"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

Yes, it is technically a hidden object type game, but there's variety in the types of puzzles.  You can do hidden object minigames or mix it up with a type of two of a kind card matching game.  There are standard point and click adventure elements, very nice graphics, decent sound and voice acting, and a story that's not too shabby.  The story was decent enough that I was a little bit disappointed that the first one in this series wasn't available on steam.  There were numerous references to events that happened in Enigmatis 1, which is not available on Steam at the time of this review.\n\nThis version of Enigmatis, which is actually the Engimatis 2 collector's edition, contains both the main story (about 4 hours long) and a side story that's maybe 1 hour long.  The side story adds a bit of back story to the main, so don't play it until after completing the main game, as it will spoil the few twists in the tale.\n\nMy personal opinion on this game, as with all games, is that fair pricing depends on the value you feel it brings.  This game has very little replayability as it is story based with little variation in puzzles between playthroughs.  The story is relatively short, but it is a great example of a short, casual adventure game.  I recommend it, but I wouldn't pay more than $6-7 for it.","October 1, 2014","true","5.6"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

I am not the usual casual player but what i am finding is their is talent abound in the industry everywhere. Why can a casula title narrate an entertaining story from start to finish and yet all the money AAA throws out cant come close to what this exceeds, baffling.\nAs for game play Enigmatis is your basic point and click adventure where you will mostly be finding a piece to unlock another piece that will eventually unlock another piece. Its all good and for the most part simple, none of the puzzles were difficult and there is a hint system built in if you get stuck. The world itself is set in a theme park and is beutifully created. The music also is excellant as it strikes the mood and tone perfectly. The only gripe as i first stated is it is B movie materaial but the lead actress voice acting is horrible, no emotion whatsoever.\nAnother great couch and laptop game that will keep you entertained and wanting to see the story till the end.\n\nPositives\nReally good story telling and writing.

It also has all the usual negative:  no saves, and a forced second run to get all Achievements.

Some of the greatest I've played through are Zak Mc Kracken and both parts of Syberia. Enigmatis seems to be a great one of these genre. I've played only a hundred minutes but still am at the beginning of the game. The storyline seems to be consistent, the graphics are unique, held in a comic style, the music supports the great athmosphere. While audio is available in english only,  the subtitles are german (localised).\n\nActually I find the game to be a good chance to improve my english language skills while listening to the talk of the characters.\n\n\nThe puzzles - at least till now - are quite easy, if not to say obvious. The story might be scaring for a younger audience.\nSo far I am happy with this buy and I hope this game will be even more tricky in the future.\n\n\nWell it took me 6 hours to complete the game. I have to say the story was great also the athmosphere and cinematics. The music was good but a bit repetitive, although there are different tracks. I give this game a 8/10 rating.\n\n1 point less for the quite short story (I have not yet played the bonus level yet you unlock after the main story)\n1 point less for the quite simple quests compared to others like Syberia and other adventure I have played in the past.\n\nAfter all this game is still a great buy. I only paid 3.24 € because of a discount I unlocked from some steam collective cards. This was also the reason how I learned about this game.\n\nI would be happy if anyone that actually plan to buy this game and played it till the end would rate and comment my review here.","July 12, 2014","true","8.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

No longer am I just looking for miscellaneous objects, I am actively engaged with the characters, and cannot wait to find out how I will MacGyver them out of their difficulties!\n\nThe major let down of this title is that it is a sequel, and the first game is not available on Steam.  This is slightly frustrating.  I have not played the original, titles Enigmatis: The Ghosts of Maple Creek, however, after playing this, I am pretty sure I know the ending of it, which is a shame.  That being said, you can follow the story, and there is definitely no need to have played the predecessor to enjoy The Mists of Ravenwood.\n\nThe only another negative aspect of this game, which is more of an annoyance, than a real criticism, is that the main protagonists voice acting is, at times, a little on the poor side.  However, the other characters are voiced to a much higher standard, and overshadow this minor flaw.  Besides, she actually does not speak enough for it to become annoying, except for in the case of the word “Sweetheart”.\n\nThis game is a gem among hidden-object game.  Its quality is something I have come to expect from Artifex Mundi games, the developer seems focused on these types of hidden-object-puzzle-adventure games, and more often than not makes them well.  Excellent stories, backgrounds and characters are always included.\n\nWith three difficulties, (though I would advise avoiding the lowest setting, as those helper sparkles will jump out on you just for taking a sip of coffee), steam achievements, collectables to find and a bonus story to be unlocked there’s a bit to do here, but nothing is overly frustrating.  All puzzles can be skipped, hidden-object areas can be replaced by a matching memory game, and there is the standard hint function to assist.\n\nOverall, if you love these types of games, you really really should play this game.  In addition, if you have never tried anything in this type of genre, this is an exceptional example to get you started on.","September 16, 2014","true","11.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I have played just basic Hidden Object games in the past, that did not include a story line, point and click, or other puzzles. This game, was amazing. The graphics were surprisingly good, story line kept me interested, and the puzzels were not -overly- hard to solve. I played through on Casual, and it lasted a good 6 hrs. Of course, due to not knowing there were certian things I should be looking for in order to achieve certian other goals during game play, I missed a few things. No worries though, you can always go back through and replay on different difficulties...granted, the story line doesn't change, you just don't get as many hints/clues.\nI would reccomend this game to anyone who likes hiddeen object games or puzzle games, and won't mind that there is a story line involved.\nOver all, I give this game a 10/10! :)","November 2, 2014","true","6.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I'm completely in love with it, though I must admit I'm a huge fan of Hidden Object Games and Point and Click adventures. Even so, this still is one of my favourites to date.\n\nThe game looks positively lovely, every new area entered is another masterpiece. I'm excited about things like birds flying away when hovering over them with the cursor and bushes moving in the background. The sounds (background and general gameplay noises) are amazing and the voice acting is pretty neat!\n\nThe horrorish atmosphere is perfect, be sure to put on a headset! It's a neat blend between horror and casual, especially for a scaredy cat like me. I love mysterious settings and creepy legends but am usually too scared to play them. Psychological Horror and jumpscares really are the end of me, so this is a nice way to get my creepy fix without it ending in being too scared to go to bed at night.\n\nThe puzzles aren’t very difficult but left me pleased when solved nonetheless. The Hidden Object parts of the game aren’t too messy or crowded with items, you can actually see what you’re looking at. You can also switch it up for a Card Matching Memoryish thing, if you’re more into that. At the beginning you can pick a difficulty, making the game harder if you’d wish to do so. I played it on the easiest setting because I’m a huge fan of plots and getting attached to the characters and wanted to focus on that for my first run.\n\nI'm on my second playthrough now, to get all achievements, and I'm still amazed by everything just as I was the first time half a year ago! Recently the first game of Enigmatis (Ghosts of Maple Creek) was released on Steam and I’m simply dying to play that one too. (Yes, I’m aware I’m not playing them in the right order but that didn't really bother me. I just want to play all games by Artifex Mundi!)\n\nTL;DR One of my favourite HOG Point&Click games.","November 5, 2014","true","12.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Note: When I played this game the first Enigmatis was not available on Steam yet.\nWhen playing for a long time scene transitions start to take longer instead of being instant.

The story is interesting, the voice acting is decent, and most importantly, the puzzles feel engaging and relevant to the story. The character animation is the standard "possessed animatronic robot" level, but you don't have to see too much of it. Secrets and collectible objects hidden here and there really motivate you to keep an eye open for the little details. I was pleasantly surprised by this game. I started playing it as a time killer, but found myself really drawn in to it in a way I hadn't with other games of this genre.\n\nMy one complaint is the final achievement which you win "for getting all the other achievements". What it doesn't say is that it isn't referring to Steam achievements, but in-game achievements (which are the same as the Steam achievements). Why does this matter? Because you have to get them all on a single profile. I finished the entire game a second time (on a second profile) and got all achievements only to find I still don't have 100% completion.

Honestly though if you are in it for the gameplay, as with most HOG games, it is very easy to pick up without having bothered to play the original title and the story does not really get affected to much if you have not played the first,  I just feel that playing both titles made my experience richer.

I am hoping there will be a sequel, but at the time of this posting there does not appear to be.

I loved how all the hidden object scenes were clear and objects are genuinely difficult to find at times but I like a challenging game where I have to work at it.

Some puzzles were easier than others but I didn't feel the need to tear my hair out. I also love that there is an option to either play hidden object or mahjong within the game. Everything about this game was exciting and I couldn't wait to finish it if I'm honest. The desire to find out what happens at the end was just too much and I needed to know! Lol.

It's colourfull, the graphics are decent (even the cutscenes) and the pace is whatever you want it to be.\n\nYou can see that the developers made a fair effort to make your journey through this game as pleasent as possible. Letting you skip cutscenes, decide wether you want to go after collectables or not, fast travel to areas you have been before, letting you skip puzzles if they take you too much time/effort and having a hint system that works well.\n\nNot that the puzzles are particularly hard. They're actually quite easy. Yet, not so easy to where you don't need to think at all to solve them.\n\nIt all takes place in a bright mystical forest where you as a detective stumble upon some events that clearly need investigating. Without spoiling too much; you come across a campervan that looks like it's been in some sort of crash. When you go inside, you find a little girl hiding. As she tells you what evil has happened to her, you soon feel compelled to help out.\n\nThe characters aren't really memorable and the story isn't great, but the game does a great job in making you want to discover the magical forest and the puzzles that are within.\n\nIf you are looking to spend some time clicking away without having to think or strategise very much, this is a great game.\n\nBuy if:\n\n- On sale. I got it for under 5 euro's, which I think is good value\n\n- You want to play a relatively easy point and click puzzle game\n\n- You like bright colours and butterflies (when you play the game, you'll know what I'm talking about)\n\nDon't buy if:\n\n- You're expecting Myst-like difficulty\n\n- You think it's scary/horror (it's not, even though they advertise it that way)\n\nPositives:\n\n- Nice graphics, bright colours, clearly has some effort put into it\n\n- Well designed, fast travel, good hints system, can skip puzzles and cutscenes\n\n- Easy, but not a total cakewalk\n\nNegatives:\n\n- Voice acting not always great, especially the main character feels like she's just reading out loud sometimes\n\n- Story feels flat\n\n- You spend a lot of time looking for parts of things to make them open and give you other parts for other things. --> Gets a little repetative after a while","June 6, 2014","true","5.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The graphics are lacking in some areas but the constant puzzles and hidden challenges like finsing butterflies and illusionary objects make the game more interesting and keeps your eyes constantly busy, this game also allows for an option between a search and find game and a matching cards game which i thought was also a good option to have when looking into a wider user. I think the game ended quite badly however and would've liked to have seen a more thorough and bigger plot twist in the end as it was rather predictable throughout.","June 14, 2014","true","4.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The puzzles are logical, and the overall difficulty scalable, with hints available. I was very impressed with the imaginative storyline and the immersive atmosphere. The game is much more story-driven than puzzle-driven, so I never got bored with it. The artwork is well done, and the voice acting engaging, though the number of voice actors limited. Overall, this is an excellent buy in the $10 and under category.\n\nI would caution that the story is probably too dark for young children.","June 15, 2014","true","6.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Not to mention beautiful yet creepy scenery. Enigmatis: The Mists of Ravenwood delivers on all fronts. The pictures are easy to see, so you're not spending a long time squinting trying to find hidden objects, and if you don't like those they have find and match mini puzzles instead. Even the animated scenes are pretty decent. Even the voice acting was good! For me the game did not get repetitive at all. The only thing I wish I had done was check for the first game before I played this one.

The mini puzzles were fairly easy and with 2 different ways to complete the hidden object sections you're never stuck searching for that last item you just can't find. The story was well done and kept me engaged the whole time, wanting to uncover more of the mystery. The only negative was that I didn't realize this was a sequel and the first game isn't available on steam yet. I will definitely play more games by this publisher, although next time I'll up the difficulty as casual was giving me too many hints.\n\n8/10","August 17, 2014","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The plot's actually fairly decent though a bit clichéd, there's a lot of puzzle variety and object scene variety as well. Some of the sequential "find and use" puzzles, some where you have images of what you need to find instead of names, some standard hidden object puzzles, it keeps things interesting. A lot of the standard puzzles are Artifex Mundi usuals but there's a few decent, interesting ones in there too. I'm not a fan of the pair-matching game that's used as an alternative to the hidden object scenes though, it's actually more tedious somehow.

Though a bit compressed, you get to jump to one place from where you can reach a few other locations. I prefer a spot on the map for every location.\n\nThe story here is interesting, though the twist is a bit obvious. I kept saying to the game, "It's the Priest." but would it listen? Also, the background rubbed me the wrong way. I don't mind obvious myths put into games, I do mind myths put into games that far too many people world-wide think are real. Makes it look like the game claims it's real.\n\nThe hidden object games are just right for my taste (medium difficulty), no endless searching for the last invisible object. I also like that you return to previous spots to find more objects from the same clutter. I think for once that part was the most fun (what with all the other things I complain about).\n\nThe puzzles are ok. Got a bit used to ever the same kind by now, though, the novelty has worn off a bit.\n\nThe pair matching as alternative to the hidden object games is a bit weird. Other alternatives I've seen were more fun. I hope they don't put this one into other games. (Playing through again for that was no fun, just a chore.)\n\nI don't like the achievements at all.

The longer you play without exiting the game and restarting, the delay between scenes gets longer and longer.  I've played several Artifex Mundi games and have enjoyed them.  The enjoyment of this one was tainted by poor performance towards the end.  I hope they fix it for future players.  Just be aware of it if you want to purchase it.  My suggestion would be to exit the game and restart after you get about halfway through.  I don't want to mention any spoilers, but you can get an idea that you're roughly halfway through since there is a pieced together narrative that you have to collect tokens for.  When you have collected about half of the tokens, do yourelf a favor and exit the game.  Restart it and finish the story.

There is alot of positives, but most of them the first one have as well. It's still a good hidden object game, with good sound and great artwork. The puzzles are quite good as well, but he experience as a whole was a little disappointing, because I can't help to compare it to the first Enigmatis game. The game is still good, just less of everything. The game was several hours shorter than the first one for me, because the puzzles was easier, and I feel that it's a shorter game overall.
