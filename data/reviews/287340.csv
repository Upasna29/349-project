CMR 2 was/is an AMAZING game, a benchmark for rally games at its time that has aged exceptionally well. How hard could it possibly be? Take that game, port it to a modern engine, maybe nix a car or two and replace decals if you can't get hold of the same licensing deals, and you've got a great game, done!\n\nBut no...\nThis game manages to be so basic, so stripped down, that it barely even qualifies as a racing game, let alone something that should be mentioned in the same breath as CMR 2.\n\nCars: CMR 2 had over 20 different cars. This game has 4. Yes, four.\n\nCourses: CMR 2 had 8 countries/courses. This game has 3. Yes, three... To make things worse, the Australia and Greece courses are basically the same gravel track. The Corsica Course is 100% tarmac. That's it. All races are in daylight, no rain. Compare that to CMR 2, where you had rain stages, night stages, snow courses, mud courses, hardpack and loose gravel courses, etc...\n\nControls/physics: Pretty much any jump will send you into a barrel roll. There's a glitch that appears pretty often where while climbing, the car will suddenly "snag" onto the track like it's a piece of fabric, and lose all momentum. Wonder how many hours has been put into playtesting...\n\nMore problems:\n- The cockpit view. MY GOD. You'll have to see this one for yourself... I'm dead serious, the Sega Daytona USA arcade machines had more detailed cockpit graphics! CMR 2 for PC came out in 2000 and it had a fully detailed cockpit for each car, what the hell happened here?\n- If you look at actual PC (not console) screenshots of CMR 2, this game does not look better in any regard, it actually looks worse... much worse. Much worse than a game from 2000...\n- Absolutely no pre-race tuning, which was a major part of CMR 2 and was pretty much obligatory to get good times at courses. But I guess it wouldn't be neccessary in a game like this anyway, where the courses are as varied as peas in a can.\n- At this point mentioning the lack of replays, additional game modes etc is pointless. This game would still be a steaming turd, with or without more content.\n\nMultiplayer: nope.\n\nController support: if you have anything more exotic than a 360 pad, you're out of luck as there are no remapping options.\n\nPlease, DON'T repeat my mistake and buy this.","July 31, 2014","false","2.3"," 605 of 650 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","605","650","2","10"

They've removed Finland, New Zealand and UK/Wales.\n\nThey have the original CMR 2.0 on PC already running on DX6-ish, why is it so much of a task for them to update to DX11 or lower and improve the textures/resolution?

Well, I have to recognize that has been achieved. You can play it... at least the parts you can...\n\nMegabazillion tracks... errr nope: The original game brings us 9 countries, (Kenia, Finland, UK, Sweden, Australia, Japan, Corsica, Greece and Italy) each with twelve stages. This rip only brings Australia, Corsica and Italy. By now, The game duration's been cut to a third.\n\nMegabazillion rally cars... errr neither: The original game places us behind the wheel of 24 rally cars, counting WRC, B group and various paint schemes. Here there are ONLY FOUR STINKY CARS. Content reduced to a fifth.\n\nThen, the controls. I'll agree Colin McRae wasn't the most realistic rally game in history (we have RBR for that), but at least you can figure out what is driving a WRC. Here, the controls are almost random. The car cuts gas in the middle of a straight without any reason at all, and the turns are divided into two: you did it or you didn't (There's no way to negotiate a drift)... Basically, I found out that I can't drive the car as I want (as in the original), but instead I have to learn how the game wants me to drive it.\n\nAnd then, the graphics... well, even worse than the original (the internal view is worth a shot, don't miss it), plus the scenary has been cut to a size that looks more like you're playing Gran Turismo 1.\n\nIn a nutshell, don't set your hopes any high: It's an awful port, ripped everywhere, and almost unplayable.\n\n(Traducción al español)\n\nComo desgraciar un buen juego:\n\nTeniendo el Colin McRae Rally 2.0 original de la época, lo que esperaba era poder jugarlo completo en el PC que tengo ahora sin tener que andar haciendo experimentos. Bueno, hay que reconocer que eso si se ha logrado, Jugarse, se puede jugar. Lo que se puede jugar...\n\nPistas a go-go... pues nó: El juego original nos permitía correr por Kenia, Finlandia, UK, Suecia, Australia, Japón, Corcega, Grecia e italia. Este rip no trae mas que Australia, Corcega y Grecia. De momento, la duración del juego se ha reducido una tercera parte.\n\nCoches de rally a go-go... pues tampoco: El juego original nos pone a los mandos de 24 coches, entre WRC, Grupo B y esquemas de pintura variados. Aquí no hay mas que CUATRO APESTOSOS COCHES. El contenido se reduce a una quinta parte.\n\nLuego ya está la cosa de los controles. De acuerdo que Colin McRae no era el juego de rallies mas realista de la historia (para eso está el RBR), pero por lo menos te podías hacer una idea. Aquí los controles son prácticamente aleatorios. El coche deja de acelerar de forma incomprensible en medio de una recta, los giros son una de dos: o entras o no entras (no hay posibilidad de negociar un derrape)... En resumen: me he encontrado con que, en lugar de conducir como yo quiero, tengo que aprender a conducir como el juego quiere.\n\nY los gráficos... pues muy justitos. Comparados con el original son incluso peores (la vista interna del coche es digna de ver), y encima han restado profundidad al escenario de una manera que parece que estés jugando en gran turismo 1.\n\nEn resumidas cuentas, no te hagas ilusiones: Es un port horroroso, recortado por todas partes, y prácticamente injugable.","July 31, 2014","false","10.8"," 139 of 153 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","139","153","0","1"

Harsh terrain, realistic and believable damage to your car as you make stupid mistakes, and a fairly competitive AI that makes it a nice challenge all-in-all.\n\nThat isn't this game. This game is a mobile port. It isn't (at all) what it tries to advertise itself as. Handling is simplified, damage is merely cosmetic at best, the terrain looks horrible. Remastered is a term many low-resolution games use these days to try and bring these experiences to the modern PC, but Colin McRae Rally doesn't manage to do any of it.\n\nIt lacks features that previous games in the series. You can't customize your car's behavior before a stage. Repairs are fairly unneeded as they don't impact gameplay, and fixing the "engine" costs the same amount of time as fixing the "suspension" or "wheels".\n\nThere isn't much else to say. This game was trading on good memories of the Colin McRae series and it's just a cash grab. It's lame, it doesn't feel like a rally game, and overall it's a perfect example of what is happening to Steam's storefront where publishers and developers have no shame about what they try to do with their advertising.","August 1, 2014","false","0.1"," 122 of 141 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","122","141","0","3"

This is not that game.\n\nWhat we have instead is a stripped-down version with less cars, fewer stages and fewer set-up/repair options which was previously released for mobile devices. Between purchase and writing this review the store description has been updated to reflect this, but it still leaves a faint glimmer of hope that this might be something better. Don't be under any illusions  - you're paying to play the mobile version with better controls on a bigger screen.\n\nIn fairness to Codemasters, this is at least a competent driving game. The cars handle at least as well as in the original, with noticeable changes between surfaces. Car damage does affect performance, but the scaled-back repair interface takes away most of the decisions in choosing what to fix between stages. There are only four cars available to drive (three of which must be unlocked by completing events), but they recreated as well as possible in the engine.\n\nUltimately though, I can't recommend this.

I start the career mode, struggling to figure out how to increase the difficulty, no you can't the "championship" is split up into several championships, where the AI starts off super easy in the first and then gets progressively harder towards the last championships. To add even more insult the first three championships are just based on their respective countries, i.e. Australia is the first championship and Greece is the second. Then they will "Mix" it up a bit and add a championship with all three countries stating "it’s time to test your skill on more difficult changing terrains!" no all they did was make the AI slightly more difficult to beat. Where the AI is concerned it is clear that for each championship they just have a set time to beat which obviously gets harder as you move onto the next championship. Secondly they start the race at 40MPH (so during the later championships you are just playing catch-up) and clearly do not suffer from car damage and hairpin turns, because from start to finish their progress bar moves at the same speed. Next is the damage system! I crash into a tree full on and my car is fully repaired for the next set of races, I cut a few corners and I have no time to repair my car properly resulting into the next two races being a challenge to stop the car from blowing up. Last the sound is ♥♥♥♥! I constantly hear screeching as if I’m sliding on tarmac even if I am playing on a DIRT road, when wearing a headset it will give you a right bloody headache. Codemasters, can you just tell us what the AI target time is on the last championship? If I know then I won’t need to keep on this repetitive ride of going through the same championship over and over and over again, I can just do a time trial. It’s a good thing that this was marketed as "based on" and not a remake, otherwise I would of had a refund, the only way this would be worth the money is if Codemasters threw in the original CMR 2.0 and give us the rest of the game! Where the funk are the other countries? Only three!. The game does have its plus points though, it works well with an Xbox 360 pad and if you handbrake around a bend you get the satisfying sound of the handbrake clicking!","July 31, 2014","false","6.9"," 33 of 40 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","33","40","0","0"

It's clear the game has seen little to no effort put into it by Codemasters, and there are just too many games better than this to waste your time with it. Even once I'd adjusted the setup of controls to make it more playable, I found I just coudn't be bothered. It's uninspiring and dull, and the menus are about as slick as a car stuck in mud.\nPlay one of the Dirt series or even Xpand Rally before this. Don't give Codemasters the idea that their ports of mobile titles are acceptable.\nNew score: 3, and game deleted, even if it doesn't take up much space.\n\n[original review]\nI've gone for a tentative Yes here, despite me kind of only half liking it. If you buy it and try it, you're getting a useful insight into mobile gaming ported to PC. You're also getting one of a few sparse rally games available for PC these days, and for that, it does hold some value. Just make sure you buy it cheap!\nI had already bought this on Android and it didn't last long before I deleted it. In hindsight I do wonder if I'd merely missed a config screen allowing you to adjust sensitivity, and in the case of PC, dead zone too.  For my first couple of goes on PC, it was horrible with a 50% deadzone meter and maximum sensitivity. The car would barely turn for most of the stick's travel, then suddeny lurch, makign it twitchy an unresponsive at the same time. Wholly unpleasant. However, step the deadzone down to a few notches off minimum, and reduce the sensitivity to about 35% and it's a different animal; it feels to control much better.\nThere are still issues mind... such as the controller being useless in some menu screens so that you can't actually select the Proceed button; or when up becomes down and vice versa.\nOnce or twice too when driving what appeared to be a rock and incident free stretch of track, the car would flip like it'd hit a big rock, causing confusion and delay as you roll the car and often end up facing the wrong way.\nIf I was to rate this game out of 10, I'd go for a 6. Which kind of puts it just above average and worth a go.

I suppose I should mention before anything that this is purely a mobile port taken straight off the app store and shoved into Steam for what I can only assume is a quick bit of money making. The price itself isn't all that bad and if you don't have an iPhone/iPod etc. and you want to play this then fine, but go into it with the certainty that it is a mobile port, the feel and style of the original seemingly lost to the pages of gaming history.\n\nTo get the full experience you'll need to play through championships to unlock other cars/rally's etc. Not a bad mechanic in itself but this game makes it feel like such a chore. First the AI is humorously slow, on my very first attempt i beat them by a minute and a half (and while I may be mistaken I couldn't for the life of me find any option to up the difficulty). Secondly there is no sense of speed while driving, I remember the original leaving me on the edge of my seat, sweating trying to work out what just happened. This just left me feeling like I was stuck in traffic during a long drive home after an exhaustingly long day of work. Now it is perhaps worth noting that my experience and therefore memory of the original may have been skewed by a 6 year olds sense of wonder and far too many Smarties, but I am not quite yet senile so I doubt it is that skewed.\n\nIt has some positives, like the version I played on an iPod I was impressed by the audio, each time I passed some fans I got a little kick out of the cheers and sounds of horns but alas this kick fades way before I reach the next cluster of my adoring groupies. The handling is average for a mobile so as far as you approach the game expecting that it’s not too much of an issue, though I still feel like I have more chance of power sliding driving at 40 KM/H in that traffic I mentioned (I feel like the game has assists enabled but no way to turn them off…).\n\nAnd that I feel is as good as any point to leave this review on, what is a pretty good mobile game somewhat unsurprisingly makes an entirely dull PC game.

Graphics might have been decent in early 2000s. Sadly it came out in 2014, meaning that it is not somewhat acceptable nor decent.\n\nThis is NOT a remake of original Colin McRae Rally, no matter what the game's store page implies. Instead it is a mobile game by the same name ported to PC. It looks like a mobile game, it sounds like a mobile game, it definitely feels like a mobile game, and it has the complexity and realism of a mobile game. So it is a mobile  game. And not a very good one either.\n\nI especially "like" how the game engine has trouble handling jumps. Weird things often happen when your car becomes airborne. Like your car attempting to do an aileron roll for no apparent reason, or being stopped by an invisible obstacle when landing. Though I would say that the game engine has trouble not just with jumps, but with pretty much everything related to driving. Controls are unresponsive and most of the time playing feels like you are driving a brick around. A somewhat weirdly behaving brick.\n\nAnd I absolutely "love" the fact that most of the objects you see on the road are completely static, which means that either they are sprites and you go through them without any physical reaction from either the car or the object, or they seem to weigh couple of metric tons regardless of size or material, stopping the car instantly. That is so 1990s. I guess you could call that retro.\n\nAlso the amount of content is minimal with just few different rallies, and there is no replay value at all. Really.\n\nVery much NOT recommended.","November 16, 2014","false","4.9"," 23 of 34 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","23","34","0","0"

First of all, despite all the buzzwords you are fed about it being a "HD Reboot" and "Based on Colin McRae Rally 2.0", DO NOT BE FOOLED. It is not the original, nor is it 2.0. It is simply a port of the mobile version, generously referred to as a "Reboot".\n\nExpect: Bare-bones graphics, dismal damage engine that is somehow worse than the orignal CMR on PS1, forward-facing sprites, indestructible shrubbery (Robert the Shrubber would be proud), a draw distance that gives the impression that somebody is physically drawing the terrain slowly with a blunt pencil, handling that makes you think that you are in fact driving on retextured damp tarmac, A bad taste in your mouth as the money leaves your account, Nicky Grist.\n\nDO NOT EXPECT: Fun, a wide variety of cars/locales (FOUR, that's right FOUR cars and FOUR countries...), HD Graphics, a game worthy of the name, a feeling of accomplishment, willingness to continue playing past ten minutes.\n\nDo not treat this title as a true PC release, as the description and media samples on the store page try so hard to portray, but as what it is; a port of a mobile game that wasn't even that spectacular as a mobile game.

It also only has 4 drivable cars, the Ford Focus, Subaru Impreza, Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution and the Lanica Stratos. Whether more tracks and cars will become available later down the line, I don’t know.\n\nThe menu design is rather clunky and is clearly designed for a touch screen device and there is no tuning section for your car and no replays after each race. There is however a section for repairing your car after 2 rally stages although as far as I can see the damage on your car does little to how you perform during a race.\n\nAs for the racing the controls are okay, the graphics are also okay however some of the textures such as the walls can look very ugly, alot of the sprites also look fairly blend eg. Crowd members and trees. To get round this there is quite a bit of motion blur which does make the game look smoother at times.\n\nThe pyhsics of the game are also okay but not great. There is some visual damage to your car when you hit objects, but this could be improved massively. There are also inconsistences in the track I found myself getting caught on flat bits of land and getting flung up into the air with no real reason.\n\nFinally the speed, when I first started the game I thought I hadn't set my car up correct because it seemed so slow. In many rally cars you find yourself in constant battle to keep the car under control, however here you can hold down the gas/acceleration button for the majority of the time without having many issues.\n\nSo my thoughts this game is okay at best, but it could of been more, should of been more. It should have brought back the old school Colin Mcrae Rally 2.0 memories. But this game simply doesn't live up to that title and that’s a shame.\n","August 2, 2014","false","4.1"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

However, in a rally game with Colin McRae in the title it’s a bit hard to not see the true potential that has gone to waste. The description of the origin of the game tell no lies, it’s a port of a mobile game so we are aware of what we can expect in terms of visuals and weather effects, sound, and so on. However, there is some information that not only I do not agree but I also find it to be a bit misleading.\n\nThe description of the game mentions different types of surfaces. While this may be true, aside of road and off-road I didn’t see any other variations. There is no mud, no heavy dust, no snow or wet tracks giving you a very limited window when it comes to variety. Speaking of variety, the number of cars you can drive is really small, only four are available. This is a very low number for a rally game and to make it worst you need to unlock them if you want to race with them in the championship. The four cars are the Ford Focus, Subaru Impreza, the classic Lancia Stratos and the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VI. The sound is as important for me as the visuals and if you are a racing fan you will want to have those crazy sound engines screaming for the next shift but once again you can’t expect such thing in this game, which is fine for a mobile port but insufficient for a PC game.\n\nIn the end I played the game and got most of it, however there is not much to see and do which makes you search for better alternatives. The final line from the Store description ends with a bang but I’m afraid to be a really misleading sentence. It says “The Classic Rally Experience Races on PC and Mac” and I couldn’t agree less. This is not true at all no matter how big or small you are into racing games.\n","December 8, 2015","false","5.9"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","2"

I see particulary the icon wirh the Focus and the colin|mcrae|Rally, i hold my breath and think, "damn, is that a sort of remix of CMR2.0, the best rally game i ever played, the one which sometimes i play with my PS3?".\n\nI look at the description, based on CMR2.0, 30 levels, 130km, i was like "finally, i will be able to play to a proper rally game on my pc", a real one not like all the recent rally game in which you have gymkhana, a caravan, sponsors every where, thousands of different races, a "story" in which you have to become the best, drive like ken block (even if i like some of his videos) doing circle and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t on a parking lot and drive on a real rally stage 5 minutes every hour. There's some other rally games, but they're never good.\n\nSo, the price should have been a little warning, but for a (very good) PS1 game HD remake i thought it wasn't so much. So i bought it, launch it and first "shock", the soundtrack in the menu, not the one i know, whatever, i'm not here for that, i want to play, less menu, no car settings, ok, ok, if they keep the essence of CMR i'm ready to lose a few things...\n\nI start to drive, gearbox in manual, like the good old times, and few minutes after i thought, maybe it's me, or the Xbox one controller, i haven't the same feeling than before. I continue to drive, in order to be sure, and finally the conclusion arrive. The cars seems to never manage to accelerate properly, i never goes further than the fourth gear and 120km/h, in fact you can but only in straight lines, the handbrake isn't very present, the physics of the games seems clearly far of CMR2.0, i was able to take corners sideways on the old game and the cars really gives the impression that you were doing it (the camera was helping too), here you can slide but, it seems to be difficult fot the car to slide when in place, when you turn, the cars slow down too much, you can't really make it slide very long.\n\nSo if you consider buying this game while thinking to CMR2.0, forget it, clearly codemaster shouldn't have evoke CMR2.0 in the description, that's miles away (in the wrong direction) of it. It's a disappointement to see that the name of a good rally games, is used to promote a cheap one.","August 2, 2014","false","5.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

There are not a ton of cars or tracks. This is a port of the mobile game which is a low budget arcade racer. If you are okay with all of that then you will most likely enjoy this game.\n\n- The graphics are outdated but get the job done. A lot of the assets seem to be taken straight from the old CMR games.\n- The audio is decent. Most of the audio seems to be from the old CMR games as well.\n- The physics are extremely arcadey. The cars are pretty slippery but in a fun way.\n- The AI drivers (Colin McRae specifically) seem to be immune to car damage. Always going full speed while you're car is chugging along. This is more noticeable towards the end of the game because there are more endurance events. It is all about damage management while going as fast as possible.\n\nI really enjoyed this game and would recommend it to arcade race fans and rally fans. I had no idea this was a mobile port until I was halfway through. That didn't stop it from being fun.\n\nThere are a ton of terrible racing games on Steam that cost much more than this, I'm not sure why people are so down on it. For $6.99 I have little to complain about.","May 20, 2015","true","14.7"," 83 of 155 people (54%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","54","83","155","7","5"

This is a ported mobile version of the game. The game control mapping is horrible because of the lack of effort in putting in place game-pad remapping code.
