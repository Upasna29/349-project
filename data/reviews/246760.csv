The battlefield in this game offers a variety that might be overlooked at first glance, but it's that what makes it much better than HoMM or King's Bounty, at least in my eyes.\n\nThe battles in the games previously mentioned tend to become dull and repetitive after a while, and I grow tired of the game and don't touch it for a long while. But in the case of this game, the battles are always quick-paced and focused. You can't just fiddle around wasting turns, you have to move and so does your opponent. Planning before the battle is as important as the fight itself.\n\nAnd that's just talking about how the fights go. The music is simply wonderful and the art is very well-polished. Still, it's a turn-based combat game, so it's a niche game on its own, but for a cautious turn-based player such as myself, this game has delivered much more than it promised.","July 3, 2015","true","152.5"," 111 of 128 people (87%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","87","111","128","5","0"

The original review was written between a quarter and one third of the way into the campaign.]\n\nIn my opinion, Legends of Eisenwald is first and foremost a turn-based squad level tactical combat game with a character development system that is focused almost exclusively on combat. The game ships with a campaign that tells a single story from the point of view of one of three possible protagonists. Your character will level and you do get to choose how your character develops in terms of the game's combat mechanics, but that is pretty much it. There are no game mechanics to provide any real character depth; and the story is very linear. NPCs with any real character are few and far between. The members of your army (really just a squad) are interchangeable generic constructs. I don't know why the devs even bothered to give them names. Thus (and there will be more below), I don't see how one can think this is an RPG in any way.\n\nI am going to judge this game largely on the merits of the default campaign as that is what one experiences as neither of the two items in the Steam Workshop (7/5/2015) speak to me. The game's fundamental combat mechanics are easy to grasp, but there is plenty of depth. This is not unfamiliar territory if one has played game franchises like Heroes of Might and Magic or Warlords. Just know that Legends of Eisenwald is not a rip-off of those other games; it is its own game. Overall, I have no complaints with the combat mechanics or the skill tree for the knight. The tactical combat is the game's strength; and, if that is enough for you, then you may enjoy this game. However, the game's liabilities are significant enough that I can't recommend the game in its current form.\n\n[There is an a scenario in the Steam Workshop that looks interesting]\n\nPoints to get out of the way early:\nUse descriptive names for your saved game files as you are probably going to need them. I know I've done a fair bit of backtracking, and I wouldn't have been able to do so as easily with the default saved game file names.\nWrap-up side quests before completing the main quest(s) in each chapter. If you don't have good save game files, there is no going back to previous zones to complete a side quest once you finish a chapter. Obviously, if you use a saved game to go back and complete a side quest, you are going to be forced to replay the chapter ending event(s). For me this is a relatively minor annoyance, but that may not be how others feel.\nThe journal and notes system does not allow you to refer back to previous chapters as far as I can tell. There are two problems here. First, there is information that one would like to refer to from previous chapters. Second, the quest and journal system does not capture all the dialog that it should to eliminate the need for a custom note feature (which does not exist in this game). Thus, one has to use another application outside the game for taking notes. Alt-Tab or play in a windowed mode; or posses perfect recall!\nThere is too little documentation for the game. Yes. The devs did post a useful User Guide and a series of intro videos. However, this is not what I mean by documentation. There should at least be a text file that systematically lists and describes all skills, equipment modifiers, etc. There isn't one. For example, there are branching skill trees for NPCs, but there is no right-click or mouse-over to explain what they they are and you can't look ahead in the skill trees to know which one seems the most interesting to you. Thus, one is forced to save the game. Try one option, and read what it does. Then you load the save game, select the other option, and read what it does. The same is true with equipment with special characteristics. Want to know if a "rugged" helmet is worth the hit to initiative? Save game. Buy item. Equip item. See what it does (sometime it is still not clear what an object does). This is the opposite of fun - it is tedious and boring; and it is a waste of my time.\n\nSpeaking of tedious and boring, there are quest objectives that require one to hit just the right spot in order to trigger a necessary event. Now I don't mind this much when there is the occasional quest that involves discovering something that should be hard to find. However, it is another matter when it comes to obvious things or when it occurs too frequently; it is maddening when one is well aware that one is wasting time trying to find the correct pixel to stand on for an event to fire. Once again, this is tedious and boring; and it is a waste of my time. Worse, it takes one right out of the story . . . and there is too little of that as it is. Yes. I would dispute that the campaign is "story rich". With almost every quest I am left wanting more story.\n\n[The maddening "find the pixel to stand on" theme does not exist in later chapters (and is limited to two instances in the early chapters), and is replaced with a slightly less annoying mechanic. Specifically, one has to hit a series of waypoints in the correct sequence. I found this annoying because I had gone off and done some exploring and grabbed some castles in advance of the story line. Thus, I had a pretty good idea where I was supposed to go in the quests; but I still had to follow the sequence of waypoints nonetheless.]\n\nLegends of Eisenwald has an interesting story to tell, but there are few opportunities for role playing and most of those opportunities are ruined by the story. Specifically, circumstances will dictate your options and your actions. One is given few real choices as the story unfolds; and there is little point in attempting to role play as, more often than not, you will be railroaded into only one course of action no matter what you do. Your only real choice is how you develop your combat skills. Thus, Legends of Eisenwald has a story to tell; but it is not your story. You are merely a puppet. In some regards, this is a very medieval point of view; and, if this was a conscious decision on the part of the devs, then they have succeeded in conveying that world view.\n\n[By the end game I was on rails; no choices at all.]\n\nThere are major missed opportunities with the campaign from both a reward and historical perspective. There was an opportunity to better distinguish between true followers, feudal levies and mercenaries - particular in terms of the transition between chapters; but the opportunity is squandered. Also, a player might expect to be rewarded by being able to carry gains forward from one chapter to the next, but this is an expectation that has not been met in my game. This may be down to a lack of skill tree depth for NPCs or perhaps it is a necessary concession to play balance. In any event, there will be unexplained losses of inventory and members of your squad between some chapters - the game doesn't even offer a simple dialog box with a plausible story for the losses. One is left to make-up one's own story to explain what came through and what did not between chapters.\n\nI am at that point in the game where I am deciding if I am going to continue playing Legends of Eisenwald. I've completed several chapters; and, if the pattern holds for subsequent chapters, I think I know what to expect; and there is not enough on offer to justify taking significant time away from other games. I've done a little back tracking through my save game files to see if I can see where things might have gone differently, and I'm fairly certain that I've not missed anything obvious. Too bad. I'll monitor future release notes in the hope that better things are to come . . . as, to this point, I definitely feel like I paid too much for the experience currently on offer. That said, I suspect I'll keep chipping away at the campaign as I do enjoy the tactical combat portion of the game.","July 5, 2015","false","96.2"," 316 of 425 people (74%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","74","316","425","11","27"

I liked the graphics and I loved the Middle Ages feudal setting. I put it on my Wishlist and when it went on sale I bought it.\n\nMy first play, however, didn't quite go as expected. It wasn't that I disliked it. It was just that I had a bit of trouble understanding some of the game concepts. I stopped play after an hour or two and moved on to other things. About a month later I decided to try LoE again, but not before I watched some gameplays on YouTube. There I learned about right-clicking and stopping time. Right clicking on my troops allowed me to study their specific attributes, blessings, curses, etc. Stopping time limited the characters on the world map to move only when my army moved. Those two simple things completely turned the game around for me.\n\nI'm sure glad I gave it a second chance. I believe that I've invested 60+ hours in it so far and I know that this game is one of my all-time favorites. (For the record, Number 1 on my list is the Heroes of Might & Magic series 1-7, and number 2 is the Spellforce series 1-2.) This game is unique, but has a number of elements, especially combat, which reminds me of the Disciples series (another favorite).\n\nSome might complain about the amount of text, but I really believe that the developers went out of their way to make an interesting story. My only small complaints are the vague information provided for a number of quests and the re-use of the same face for multiple characters.\n\nAnyway, a long review, but I HIGHLY recommend this game. If you enjoy turn-based strategy, the Middle Ages, and think that you might like taking a castle by force, collecting money from your serfs, and building up a strong army to take out your enemies, pick-up LoE.","February 18","true","139.9"," 47 of 51 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","47","51","2","0"

You return to your lands only to find your former vassals at war with each other, bandits ravaging the lands and strange pagan cults arising.\n\nLegends of Eisenwald promises a fresh new look at old-school RPG and turn based strategy glory, long forgotten in today's big releases. You are to assemble a team of capable warriors, healers and priests, manage their equipment and upgrades and lead them to victory against the many foes now scattered throughout the lands. You go through various chapters of the main story, all taking place in different areas, most of which pretty darn big. Lots of castles, villages and taverns bid you welcome and offer mercenaries or information, ruins and bandit hideouts offer their ill-gotten gains to whoever is brave enough to demand them back.\nFor most of the game, you will be controlling your personal army of 12 soldiers (at max.), following the main quest. This alone will allow you to go down different paths, with a little bit of open-world feeling thrown into the mix. When returning to your old vassals, they will ask you to deal with their respective neighbours for them, and it is up to you who to side with. Apart from following the story, a healthy number of sidequests will beg for your attention. Some may offer unique treasure, others might get you a valuable companion. If you played Mount & Blade, the campaign-map will feel very familiar. Each army is represented only by one token character and the time goes by in a flash (adjustable).\nIf you meet with a hostile army or enter an enemy settlement, battle will commence. Here is where the turn based strategy part advertised by the game comes into play. It is your task to organise your soldiers on a field of hexagons, with melee characters in front and support in the back. Based on every character's initiative-value, they all take turns going at each other. Some units have special abilities, some may buff your troops or curse the enemy.\nCombat is done well enough, though hardcore-fans of the days gone by might find it lacking in depth. Apart from different stats and abilities, your equipment plays only a minor role and will not even change the physical appearenace of your soldiers. Upgrading them feels like a somewhat sterile and uninteresting process. Quests are generally very straight-forward and come with exact map-markers, so friends of complex storylines might not get their money's worth here either.\nOne major problem with the game: It is still in development, as the Early Access tag suggests. I experienced a lot of crashes and graphical glitches that have yet to be fixed.\n\nEisenwald has an interesting setting. The music is atmospheric and the aesthetics are fitting. Also, work on your pronounciation-skills for German words, as "Eisenwald" is only one of many.\nIs Eisenwald worth buying? Maybe not so much at this point, but at the very least it is worth to keep an eye on it. If you want your nostalgia-nerve tickled, this might just be the thing for you.","October 11, 2013","true","1.5"," 68 of 88 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","68","88","0","5"

Most people assumed that this game is an old school RPG game (as it is announced) and judged accordingly. If you want to categorize a game like this it simply falls somewhere between the Heroes series and Disciples series.\n\nI don’t usually write any reviews on games but in my opinion this one is particularly wronged by too many people. The early access version is 6-8 hours long to beat on first playthrough but there are people who played it like 40-50 hours and then disliked it on so many levels which is odd.\n\nAt this stage this game deserves at least a 7 out of 10.\n\nPros:\n-Good graphics\n-High quality sound and music\n-Good controls and camera mechanics\n-Simple yet sufficient tutorial as a part of the campaign\n-Good story telling\n-Manageable army and battlefield size\n-Simple yet fun to play battles.\n-Good blend of side quests\n-Challenging AI both in strategy map and battles\n\n\nCons:\n-Some bugs and crashes which may hopefully be fixed before full release\n-Quest tracking is very unclear, some won't update as you progress, you have to read through the quest that you are on several times before you can figure out what to do.\n-Throws you in too deep and leaves you in the dark too soon.\n-Camera can’t be unlocked in strategy map (always fixed on your party)\n-no minimap (going between the map and strategy map is tiresome at some point)\n-very slow levelling\n-Lack of restart level option (VERY important to have.)\n\nOverall most of the cons are agreed upon by too many people but most of them can be fixed, polished or added before the full release of this game. As far as I can track the developer team is highly interested in what people think of their game and active on the Forums. So I believe that they can release a way better final product at the end.\n","October 14, 2014","true","30.6"," 41 of 47 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","41","47","0","0"

Then along comes a game that reinvigorates you all over again, makes you sit up excitedly, totaly engages you in it's world , story and characters, and fully restores your faith in gaming as the ultimate escapism.\n\nLegends of Eisenwald is that game.\n\nAfter many hours of play the one thing that stood out for me was the writing, it's excellent. The low fantasy type story reeled me in and held me in it's grasp right from the beggining. Many games stories are judged in the first few hours of play so it's critical the player is kept interested. How many games have tried and failed at this test in the past ?, hundreds?. LoE, however, has no such worries. Without revealing too much on the story, as others have done in previous reviews below, it's safe to say that LoE is an excellent and believable knight errant type story set in medieval Germany. No voice acting opens the players imagination more and i honestly feel it's the best writing in a game i've had the pleasure to read for a long long time, it's the games crowning achievement .\n\nThe turn based combat , character leveling up, game economy, items etc is deep and addictive. You can spend a long time purchasing the right armour, weapons, medallions, rings and potions etc and just as much time balancing it all between your team of soldiers, archers, monks and healers to ensure success in battle.\n\nI cannot add more than others have already said about this game other than it's one of the best RPG's i've played in a while. It's totally engrossing, a diamond in the rough, a gem of a game i sincerely recommend to the discerning gamer.\n\nAnother positive is the effort made by the developer to engage the players to guarantee an enjoyable experience. I don't remember seeing a problem that wasn't fixed speedily or a forum post or comment that wasn't replied to by the developer. The input from Aterdux from day one of development right up to now has been nothing short of tremendous.","July 22, 2015","true","89.2"," 37 of 43 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","37","43","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/doc_rock2/recommended/246760/","doc_rock2","Doc Rock","http://steamcommunity.com/id/doc_rock2/","485 products in account","I went into this Early Access game made by a development studio i had not heard of unsure about its content and a bit skeptical about its quality, but soon after I began playing all these doubts were put to rest. I suddenly found myself deeply submerged into the game and all it has to offer. Legends of Eisenwald is a true strategic RPG game that skillfully combines the heroic elements of  old-school role-playing with tactical turn-based combat and presented in a medieval setting filled with unique legends and folklore.\n\nIn this game players will create their hero from a selection of three initial classes and then recruit a small army to travel throughout the realm fulfilling quests, investigating myths and legends, and conquering castles among other things. LoE is still very much Early Access and there will certainly be more changes made. However, this game is entertaining and playable in its current state and offers a lot of nice features.\n\nOne of the most interesting features in this game is the concept of changing how the turn-based combat takes place. Unlike other games, Legends of Eisenwald has decided to remove movement points from combat in order to streamline it and make it more dynamic. I like knowing that one strategic movement or action can ultimately determine the outcome of a battle regardless of strength or numbers. Of course, there are lots of weapons, items, and spells typical to any RPG game that will also aid your army in battle. There is also an upgrade tree for improving your units as they gain experience along the way. The user interface is minimal and easy to use. Gameplay speed can be adjusted and there is an option to auto-play battles at any time. The developers have even included a level editor that will allow more content to be added by the community.\n\nBeing Early Access also means that the game still has a few drawbacks though. There are still a few bugs in the game so I recommend leaving auto-save enabled or save your game often. The game includes a function to send error reports and crashes directly to the developers when a bug is encountered. However, this is also somewhat buggy and does not always work as intended. Also, the game still lacks the lustrious shine that a finished product has. While the artwork and graphics are very nice and full of detail, there is still no "wow" factor when it comes to battle animations. There is a ton of lore in this game that is scripted well, but the english translation is not very good  and can be confusing to read at times. One would think that this would have been picked up and sorted out through the beta testing community but currently it has not. Some voice acting would also enhance this game tremendously, but i'm not sure it is even being considered. Still, this game is an overall delight and it will definitely improve before its final release.\n\nThe Good:\n=======+  High quality artwork and music\n+  Good storyline campaign with tutorial help\n+  Solid game content offering many hours of play\n+  Difficulty options that challenge players\n+  Many customizing options and items for units and heroes\n+  Adjustable game speed settings\n+  Minimal requirements allow older systems to work\n+  User interface is simple and convenient\n+  Level editor included for the modding community\n+  Steam Trading Cards and Achievements\n+  Active development team\n\nThe Bad:\n======-  Text translations (english) need a lot of work\n-  Bugs and game crashes still present\n-  No controller support\n-  Battle animations are dull and boring\n-  No voice acting or cutscenes/strictly point & click\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n===========Legends of Eisenwald is an entertaining game overall and considering its still in Early Access beta there is still a strong possibility that the game will be even better upon completion. While it still needs a lot of polishing and there are still a few scattered bugs in the coding, I still enjoyed it tremendously and would recommend it to fellow strategy/RPG gaming fans. With the right adjustments and improvements this game could become an instant classic.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","March 5, 2015","true","223.5"," 36 of 45 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","36","45","2","0"

I cant understand where to go. You have to stand in the correct places on the map after finding them for the story to continue.  Often times its up a steep mountaintop with no clue of a road.   In the first level everything you built up to gets taken away.  Then there is a troop chasing you so your time to escape is limited and the troop is undefeatable that follows you to each new scenerio.  Other things are...what you would expect to complete in tasks is unfulfilling and a waste of time.  The only thing I like about this game is the battle mode.  But, you dont have all the characters equipment available in towns and often thrown into 3 or 4 battles one after another when you would expect to win.  You have little to nothing to manage with and not much going on.","July 30, 2014","false","50.6"," 170 of 273 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","170","273","0","4"

It's a unique blend of role-playing and strategy, in a historical medieval setting with supernatural elements.\n\nI particularly like the amount of customization and choices you can make. I made three playthroughs, one with each of the characters (Knight, Baroness and Mystic), and each with a different driving force (honor, profit, revenge) and despite following the same general storyline over the same 5 or 6 maps, so many of the details differed that they felt distinctly different. It also made me realize how much I missed on my first playthrough, by not exploring enough, or not paying enough attention to rumors in taverns, etc...\n\nSome people seem to think the combat is simplistic and lacks strategy, but I beg to differ. There are so many variables that you can play with that affect the outcome of the battles. Party size, positioning, items, weapons, terrain, whether it's day or night, whether you're inside or outside. Getting good at using all this to your advantage will save you a lot of money on healing. ;)\n\nAnother issue that people have with this game is the fact that your party and/or money get reduced between the maps. Personally I liked the challenge of each map, figuring out when to do what and how to get strong enough to take on the hardest opponents (or lure them into a forest at night so they couldn't fight on horseback). It also invites you to do side-quests which will yield useful rewards like powerful items, cash or people joining your party.\n\nAside from perhaps the last map, where you return to part of a previously visited map, every map has it's own distinctive feel, which ensures that the game never feels repetitive.\n\nIn short, I whole-heartedly recommend this game. I have to confess that I was originally put-off by the (in my opinion) relatively high price tag and waited until it was on sale. I now regret this, I would have gladly paid the full price. Especially if you see the amount of effort the devs put in this game and the way they respond to every, even minor, question. To make up for that I bought the Knight's Edition and Season pass despite already owning the first DLC, because I feel such dedication should be supported!","January 26","true","190.8"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","26","29","0","0"

For all turn based lovers this game has a lot of potential but still a lot to improve.\n\nPros: Great weapons & armours, graphics is good, original story.\n\nCons: Move around in combat is not easy, if you are not moving for the kill you should stay put. Skip a turn for one unit, is only avalilable once per battle. And the worst of all, leveling up is extremely hard since the exp gained per battle is average 2 points, when most of the characters (Depends on the class) is 120, 150 to level up. And you have to ditch your party each chapter, what makes even harder to level up.\n\nConclusion: If you are like me, who wants to be a part of this game from early start and is confident that is going to improve, I would defitely recommend buying, however, If you like final version of the games and do not have patience to deal with some bugs and changes (Part ot getting early access) then wait for the final review.","December 19, 2013","true","21.2"," 37 of 48 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","37","48","0","0"

Straight to the point right? Simply put, it's very similar to Heroes of Might and Magic (specifically 6) and Disciples except tone down the Fantasy about 5 notches and put it Medieval Germany. There are extensive upgrade trees for each unit with a very "figure out where to go" and "how to win" mentality in the game whilst still being very story driven. Graphically, the game is very pretty with a great soundtrack (I love good in-game music) that really works to immerse you in the world. It's definitely a good example of an Early Access game that was released a decent finished product on Steam compared to the garbage island levels of crap EA games that never finish or run out of funding (ie Spacebase DF-9). Of course, there are still some problems with the game but it's most nitpicky stuff that only someone like myself (who is so far up his own ♥♥♥) would actually point out... like equipping items doesn't change your appearance. You know? Stuff like that. Summed up, I really like the game and I can't wait to log some more hours in LoE.\nVideo Gameplay and Opinions:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVvMeGqAmis","July 7, 2015","true","1.5"," 32 of 40 people (80%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","80","32","40","11","0"

Enjoyable, good story. The changes needed are mostly in cost and management. The xp cost to level is very high, leveling is very slow and after 30 battles you may not even get to level 2 with anyone in your army. Healing is also very expensive, this is a huge detriment to party management. If no cost change would be done then I  would allow healers in your army to heal between battles as well. Currently there is no between battle skill use. If a healer can heal during battle why not in between? Whether it be a limited use between battles or a certain number per day. Lastly on the negative side, you lose all equipment in your inventory and all gold when you leave the starting scenario. You arive in the second scenario with nothign in your inventory and 600 gold. This was bothersome as I had 2000 or so gold and about another 600 gold in eqiupment in my inventory, a fix to this would be excellent. For now be prepared, get the best equipment you can get and put it on your character not in your inventory. Characters do not change appearence other than horse and weapons/shield would be fun if they did. There is no way to customize character looks as well.\nOn the positive side, The combat is tacitical and you have to pay attention to whats coming up and how characters are moving on the battlefield. A small mistake can cost you. The fact that you can equip all characters in your army is very nice, although I would like to see graphic changes as you equip items other that just weapons. This allows you to customize how an army fights and changing a few weapons can have drastic effect. The graphics are very pleasent and easy on the eyes, game play is easily understood and controls are easily dealt with as well. The story is interesting and the game as a whole is engaging. The game has minimal fantasy element and this is not detrimental to the game at all. I would recommend this game for those that want a game you can relax and enjoy with.","February 15, 2015","true","11.3"," 33 of 42 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","33","42","2","0"

The graphics are rich, the music is excellent, and the writing is extraordinary.  Very immersive storyline, and I have found the character development is both challenging and rewarding.  This is not an 'action rpg', and the combat does not play like an action rpg.  Successful combat is more dependent on thought-out strategy than hack-and-slash.

It's a medieval low fantasy world where magic and the supernatural are present but pretty rare and low key compared to a more typical dnd-esque environment.\n\nCombat works similar to the older Disciples games where you have front and back lines meant for melee and ranged/support units respectively. The initiative stat determines the order in which the units act. Unlike in Disciples, units in LoE can actually move though options here are limited to attacking the nearest unit or using an ability or potion. There's a good amount of tactical options in terms of how and when you attack (there's a wait command), how you use your abilities,   how you build your squad and such though, imo, gameplay here is not as detailed or engaging as in Expeditions: Conquistador or Battlebrothers for example.  For one terrain plays no role in LoE except in terms of unit positioning. There's no traps, obstacles, "high ground", no attacks of opportunity or flanking (except for a specific "rogue" unit). There's a few unit types that fight better in difficult terrain and mounted units have to dismount in forests and buildings but that's it and it rarely comes into play.\n\nOn the strategic level LoE plays similar to King's Bounty. You move around in real time fighting, trading, conquering, training, completing quests, etc. One nice part of LoE compared to Disciples or Expeditions: Conquistador is that each of your soldiers has their own inventory allowing you to customize their loadout with certain restrictions depending on unit type. Your men and women also level up and "evolve" into new units with a few branching choices available. You can pick between 3 hero characters representing the usual melee, ranged and support roles.\n\nLoE allows you to capture castles and various other locations to earn money over time and you can leave units in castles to be trained and level up on their own. However LoE isn't really a strategy game like Heroes of Might and Magic and like in King's Bounty the world is fairly static in the sense that it generally waits for you to act rather than actively trying to destroy you although there are roaming enemies that will harras you and capture some of the locations. This means that once you have positive gold income you could technically place some units in a castle and just leave the game running for hours while gold and xp accumulate. This makes some of these strategic elements feel tacked on and redundant, like LoE is trying to stradle the line between King's Bounty and HoMM but doesn't quite make it. But in the end it doesn't really hurt the game and there's no actual need to grind this way.\n\nStory elements seem to be very much derived from medieval folklore as well as pagan and Christian religions which adds to the game's down to earth, low fantasy feeling. The writing is pretty verbose and there's quite a bit of lore and stories to read in-game which can sometimes contain clues for quest solutions or secret items. Since the writing is so grounded in real life history and myths many fantasy geeks might find it too mundane or boring. Personally I found it charming and a refreshing break from the usual high fantasy stuff but I'm also someone who always reads in-game books and lore and enjoys text in general.\n\nOverall while I certainly wish combat had a bit more going for it and the strategic level was either better fleshed out or further streamlined (basically either KB or HoMM style) it's certainly a fun game for fans of turn based tactics. Just keep in mind I said tactics, not strategy.","August 25, 2015","true","69.9"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","20","21","0","1"

By sticking to a well-defined set of rules of limited engagement, the developers have effectively created their own version of tactical chess. Recall in chess, not every piece can move as it might like, but they have very restricted types of movement in how they can attack (a pawn can only move forward, usually one space, but must attack diagonally).\n\nThis game is similar except any movement is the result of an attack, and not purely done in and of itself. The movement, when it occurs, is well defined and can be anticipated. Having these kinds of limits makes this game distinct from other games like King's Bounty and Eador, Masters of the Broken Realm, which are both great games in their own right. In this respect, I would argue, less is actually more, in terms of the depth this game provides. I really thought Eador was extremely tactical until I played this game, and decided this one had a more "mature" type of strategy than the you-can-move 1, 2 or 3 spaces kind of games.\n\nI believe the overwhelming reason to buy and play this game is to, in essence, play a new type of low-fantasy tactical chess based upon a 36-hex board. This game has all the tactical depth that chess does given in how it works. It may not be balanced, or fair, or even easy to grasp in terms of what this game really is, but it is a gem in its own right.","August 12, 2014","true","129.0"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","21","24","0","1"

It seemed too simplistic (i.e., there weren't going to be enough tactical options). however, I ended up liking it a lot and found the beauty in it's simplicity. It's quite different from any other turn-based strategy game I ever played; sometimes your options are limited but that just has to be taken into account when planning your strategy (the worst thing is when you are forced to knowingly send one of your soldiers into a vicious counter-attack).\n\nUnfortunately, you will sometimes have to endure walls of text. And let me be clear I have no problem reading text in my RPGs. When it's well-written, I like it just fine. But some of the many legends in Legend in Eisenwald (usually encountered as rumors in taverns) are… shall we say, needlessly verbose. They just go on and on and on. And while they are usually somewhat interesting and may even play an important part in the main story, I feel that many of them could be cut in half without losing anything substantial.\n\nSome other things I wasn't crazy about:\n\n*At the end of most chapters, you say goodbye to most, if not all of your soldiers and their gear.. That means all of the units that you worked to build into powerful army will be gone and you'll have to pretty much start over building your army in the next chapter.. leveling up peasants and buying basic equipment.\n\nI understand that this probably done for game balance reasons (and in particular, to give you incentive to conquer enemy castles, which allows you to hire additional units)…. nevertheless, its very irritating to lose all your veteran soldiers and their gear, and the game usually gives very weak rationale for this (e.g., someone tells you that a large force will attract too much attention so you can only take two units… But then as soon as you get the next chapter, you'll likely recruit more troops ASAP). I would've preferred if the game was balanced to take more of my units with me… You spend a lot of time rebuilding your army in each chapter, and while that can be fun for awhile, it inevitably feels like busy work.\n\n*Moving across some areas in the game can be pretty painful… I constantly experienced misclicking as it's seldom clear where you can and can't go on each area... Lots of twists and turns. It would have been nice if you could double click on a point on the map and have it plot a course to the destination… Instead, you have to actually see the place you want to go to, and since your field of view is so small, you will have to constantly rotate the camera to try to see whatever town or building you're trying to get to.\n\n*There were a few instances where enemies respawned. I could understand if they were vampires or something, but no, there in one chapter I remember regular enemies coming back to life and retaking the castle.\n\n*There were some instances in the game where my character makes some morally questionable choices that I would not have liked to do… There's perhaps a couple times in the game when you can make a choice, but for the most part your character is going to complete their quest by any means necessary. It's a bit frustrating in a role-playing game when things like this are decided for you… In the final chapter in particular, it seems my character acts based on a decision I made several chapters ago..\n\nThe final chapter dragged on a bit as you have to clear a bunch of castles, but I found the battles to all be rather easy (except the final battle which had an insanely powerful enemy).\n\nOther than that, I really liked the game overall and would recommend giving it a shot if you want to try something different. The music is fantastic and the combat / character class progression system is simple, yet effective.","September 24, 2015","true","91.0"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","16","17","0","1"

I like the mixture of Germanic setting and low-fantasy:\n* The story and quests, whilst at times do get a bit confusing (get ready to do a lot of wandering around), are pretty interesting in a "figure it out by yourself" kind of way.\n* The combat is different to most games, but by no means "bad". It's actually pretty good in Dark Souls kinda "git gud" way.\n* But my main issue is that sometimes the descriptions in quest logs aren't really that useful and are written in a (sometimes) convoluted way. But I suspect that's because English isn't the devs' first language, so I guess it's understandable. But, still....\n\n\n*** MINOR SUB-QUEST SPOILER***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, in one quest early on, you have to find a wealthy merchant who is involved in some grave robbing by a (quest description: watchtower casting a shadow on a rock by a southern gate).

I spent 15min running around looking for it - even went to the south of the main town from which the merchant hails.

Much of the strategy takes place before a battle ever begins. Who gets which item, which row to place your units in, and who goes on the flank. Never before has initiative been so important. Support units are no longer a bonus, they are a real strategic necessity.\n\nNotice how every game of M&M or King's Bounty turns into a combat grind that keeps you from finishing the game? You will not get that here. Combat is quick, and you no longer spend half the battle jockeying for position. I don't know about you, but that combat fatigue eventually wore me down, and I always eventually found my desire to play the game diminish as the thought of another half hour battle almost had me in tears.\n\nEnjoy strategy and combat that does not dominate the game. Here you get a well written story, with many hard choices and a real touch of human nature where good and evil are not always easy to distinguish.\n\nThe developers care about this game to a degree which sets them apart from most other games. Legends of Eisenwald is a wonderful game, with a compelling story no strategy fan should overlook.","October 18, 2014","true","60.7"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","19","24","0","0"

If this is true we can assume that not all gold glitters. Well, this game could be gold, but it doesn't glitter.

Some of the things I don't care for are:\n1. You can't just move a characted into a defensive battlefield position, he either attacks or skips.\n2. You have to pay for certain party members but you are expected to upgrade them. It is difficult to run an efficient party if you are trying to build up players but need to manage their time in the party. let me fall in love with my characters over time rather than shuffling them through, or else I don't become attached to them nor do I care when they die.\n3.

Well, it's definitely good. But that's from a fan's point of view, especially considering I played their old game; Discord Times, and loved that just as much. So from an analytical view of the game, what do I think?\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay is quite interesting. You have troops you can hire for gold, but they don't cost much due to castle support. This essentially tells you how many troops you can support without paying them. Then you have the mercs. Troops you can hire for a bit more gold, but you have to pay them per day to keep them around. Expensive, but they can be high level units or simple peasants, so you get what you pay for with them.\n\n- Equipment\nEquipment is definitely interesting, but you should know the scale of things. The better it is, the more gold it costs. However, the market you get them at does have an effect. Purchasing equipment at a merchant pier will cost you loads more gold than if you purchase it at a rural market, but this also affects the quality of the items. Merchant piers cost a ton for their items, but their often high quality, and really powerful in your effort for domination while rural markets aren't as costly, but the quality is lower too. However, it's not so low as to completely dismiss it, for a fight can be won with a simple pitchfork, if the odds are close.\n\n- Units\nTalking about equipment and such and yet not covering the units? What kind of monster am I? The units are simple and basic at first glance. Recruits, hunters, female healers (I've forgotten their names) and religious men. That about covers it. However, each unit can upgrade a number of times. Recruits can become veteran pikemen or infantry sargents, hunters can become hard hitting crossbowmen or incredibly nasty sargent archers, and the religious lot can become incredibly useful at healing or buffing your other units, if you choose to send them down that route. Each unit can be manipulated and upgrades to your desire. I nearly forgot the nobleman however. He's the unit that you want to upgrade for knights, paladins and other very nasty units. However, due to being noble blood, he costs an utter fortune for healing, and upgrading him takes a fair while, and a lot of effort.\n\n- Story\nI can't really say much about it, other than it's quite good, and each action that happens in the storyline, as well as for your character itself makes sense. I won't spoil any of the storyline since it's quite good, but I will tell you this much: Your actions define this story. It's not a simple walk in a park down a narrow hallway, you have options. Be sure to pick what you think is right.\n\nOverall scores\nGameplay: 8/10 - Could definitely be improved in some areas, but at face value, it's definitely good.\nVisuals: 7/10 - The game looks quite pretty but I do notice some performance issues in heavy forest.\nSound: 9/10 - This is truly brilliant music in my opinion. The opening music is fabulous and the sound effects fit in with every swing of a sword. Small improvements could be made to where each sound happens but other than that, spot on.\nStory: ?/10 - It's a really good storyline, with multiple branching areas and different ways you can do things. It's truly brilliant.\nFinal score: 8.5/10 - Due to this still being an early access game, there will be errors and issues abound. I've run into several crashes over the course of the development, and it's annoyed me every single time. But talking with the developers and their view for this game, they are definitely working on it. I hope this turns out to be a brilliant game on release!","April 7, 2015","true","43.1"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","17","22","0","0"

Totally loved it. Here's a little summary.\nThe game is a tactical RPG. The story in short is basically you're the son/daughter of a Count on a trip to visit a friend of your father's. After playing the tutorial map, bad things happen and you set on a quest of vengeance/discovery. The flow of the game is similar to Heroes of Might and Magic with a Disciples combat style, the flow goes that you play several isolated maps (scenarios) connecting the story like in HoMM. Also like in HoMM, when you finish a map, you leave all or most of your accumulated troops/money/equipment behind and start the next map with your main character (more experienced) and little else.\n\nCombat can get a bit to get used to. Many times you'll be thinking like it's an RPG and ask 'why can't I do this, doesn't make sense!', until you realize combat is more like chess. In chess you don't ask "why can the Queen move 7 spaces at once and the King only 1? It doesn't make sense!', it's just the rules of the game, and when you realize the tactical combat is a mini-chess match, it all clicks. When you get a new combat screen, see (your and your enemy's) troops composition, their position and combat order, you need to figure out a way to win the battle, and to do so in an efficient way. One of the challenges of the game is the 'war of attrition', as resources are many times restricted, winning 'pyrrhic battles' will soon leave you broke and unable to afford healing your troops before the next battle, so you have to learn to find the efficient way to win.\n\nThe game has plenty of choices and consequences. Do you want to betray this guy for a quick solution or take longer and help him? There may or may not be consequences to every action, and those consequences may or may not be immediate (some things happen as a result of a decision you made 4 maps ago). It's more for flavor though, you won't "lose" the game if you made the 'wrong' choice (since really there is no right or wrong), but it's nice to see things reflecting choices you had already forgotten you made.\n\nThere isn't much for character customization, remember this is NOT an RPG even though it resembles one. You can be one of 3 classes, the 'skill tree' is very shallow, and they all share 2 of the 3 branches, so only one branch is class specific, and it only has some 5 or 6 nodes total.\n\nYou can have up to 11 additions to your group for a max total of 12, these range from infantry guys (which can be specialized as defensive, offensive, pikemen), noblemen (which can be specialized as mounted knights or double-wielding duelists), ranged guys (which can be specialized into double-shooting archers or armor piercing crossbowmen), healers (which can be specialized into pure healers or witches) and finally religious men (which can be specialized into pure buffers or holy warriors). Don't get too attached to them as most if not all of them will be gone after each map. Your companions are basically chess pieces.\n\nIt's also moddable, there are already some user created maps out there that I haven't tried. I wonder if users can also create full campaigns or just scenarios, hope so! If not, the wait for me may be too long for a sequel.\n\nTotally recommended!","July 15, 2015","true","68.0"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

The combat system is new to me (possibly similar to disciples 2 or discord times but I haven't played any of those games) though similar to HoMM but different in a good way. Instead of collecting stacks of units which quickly becomes a chore each unit represents only one man, you are limited to having an army of at the most 12 men, but more frequently 6-9 which means every man is important. I would say it's just enough options to feel like I have a choice yet not so much that it would be overwhelming to keep everything in mind. The character development is really slow, I've seen it described as "glacial" but it fits the game, I wouldn't say it's a bad thing (though I must say I liked the short 3x exp period right after launch).\n\nYou can certainly do a lot worse for this price (whatever it is, think it was around €28 when I got it). When you're done with the main story there are scenarios and a scenario editor, not to mention the main story can be played with 3 different classes for the main character, there's plenty of value in here.","July 5, 2015","true","66.9"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","15","20","2","0"

Advancement is stupid slow, you feel like you're not getting anywhere.  On the Lahnstein map the enemies just kept spawning no matter how many you kill, and healing is a nightmare thing you have to do after just about every battle or you're screwed.\n\nOn top of that, I finally, after several hours of playing, get to the second map.  Guess what?  All my loyal friends, all my gold, everything except what my character was carrying on his person just disappeared and I had to start building a new band of merry men from untalented dimwits all over again.

All of it is fun for "slow gamers" that enjoy beliaveble late middle-age atmosphere, chatting with outstandingly deep characters, unique style battles where every detail matters.\n\nAfter some time I gave up trying to figure up everything myself, running all over the map again and again, searching the right person at the right place at the right moment to trigger the right event. Luckilly, after some effort I found an excellent  walkthrough [www.playground.ru] translated to english.

Beautiful artwork and music really helps create the world.\n\nSmall elements of fantasy really add to this game, as anyone who studies history will know, many people were very superstitious during this period. Legends, myths, magic and real history were often intertwined in the peoples pyche.\n\nIn summary, a great game from a small committed studio.

Basics are that you move a group of troops around (some melee, some ranged and a few support) and fight other troops to gain gold and xp for your army.\n\nThe troops are individual fighters and you will have (including your hero) around 5 to 7 most of the time. The strength of your army does not come from having a horde (thousands of the monster X like in HoMM) but rather from recruiting a select few and leveling them up (choosing permanent sub-classes) and giving them good gear (that can have a huge impact on the individual fighting capabilities of each troop.\n\nThe game is heavy on story and rpg-elements (optional quests) that press the game onwards, so expect to read about interesting things happening in the world and make choices that affect the flow of the story based on what you read. All the story elements and rumours (from inns) also hint at interesting things that may or may not be actual hidden treasures and bonus elements/fights on the maps you are on (or will get to), which makes paying attention to the stories you encount a joy. Often some strange rumour will lead to you finding something fun hidden on a mountain or in a forest somewhere if you visit at just the right time of day and with the right things in your pockets :)\n\nBest of all is the way the developers reimagined the fights. They have the following rules for the fights:\n1) There is no action for moving a troop -- it has to be part of another action\n2) All troops MUST do an action every round. For most this means you HAVE to attack.\n3) All melee attacks MUST be at the troop nearest you. So take this into account before you move your melee off to one side exposing your flank.\n\nIt makes for interesting fights that don't just rely on the computer doing stupid things (like in HoMM) while you defend and kite.\n\nThe only issue I have encountered so far is that when recruiting you cannot see the upgrade tree (the classes a troop can develop into), so you do a bit of save scumming to circumvent this interface problem.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who likes a good story mixed with interesting tactical fighting.","July 18, 2015","true","14.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","4"

They had completed the game numerous times and couldn’t get enough of it. It had been a game that I had personally considered prior to the request but as a title that was released prior to our launch but not meeting our 2014 or earlier Steamified Revisits period was a game that I had personally placed on the backburner. However, I can honestly tell you that I am thankful for their recommendation.\n\nOne of the first things that I want to say about games such as this one is that it is one that I can leave playing in the background and can dedicate short periods of play to it at a time. There are a lot of games that you really have to be dedicated to playing rather than having paused for periods of time. As a lone hand at Steamified I don’t often get to play games through to completion before having to make their feature. In some ways my nutshells are a first impressions plus (several hours of gameplay rather than completion) and so I feel a bit like a full time employee who would like to get through a massive list of games when its not a reality unlike say someone who works for a publisher and is paid full time to play new release games through to completion – sometimes multiple times – before writing on games. Titles such as Legends of Eisenwald are perfect for me. I can write and work around playing them. Games that constantly need attention (e.g. multiplayer games) are at a disadvantage in my life right now.\n\nBut that means that the content that I need to play needs to be engaging. I need something that I can feel a part of albeit for a brief period. This game was perfect in that regard. I found myself involved in its world immediately. This is a game that immediately pulls you in and grabs you. The manner in which the story is told, the narrative, the characters backgrounds and the status of the world are all conveyed in a thorough manner. I had no trouble in jumping in and out of the game at any point throughout the first six hours of the game.\n\nThis isn’t necessarily a game that you’re going to be expecting great graphics and sound from yet everything is at a level that I can appreciate. It’s more so the gameplay and the turn-based combat that needs to be top notch and it is. I thoroughly enjoyed the various strategies that I employed and tinkered with throughout the early game. The story telling was also exceptional. Obviously people are going to make comparisons to the Might and Magic franchise and the King’s Bounty games and I believe that the story is stronger than both. The setting being the Middle Ages and European history is a strong point of differentiation for this game and one that it conveys to the player extremely well.\n\nLegends of Eisenwald deserves your attention if you have yet to play it and are a fan of the genre. It represents solid value for money given the amount of work that has gone into every aspect of the game.\n\nFor more reviews and our popular giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com.\n","May 2","true","9.5"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

It's fairly heavy on unit customization and RPG elements.  Unlike games in the same genre like HoMM, you can hand your footman an axe and he'll use an axe, a spear and he'll use that.  The units level in the typical fashion as other games, gaining more power, but you can customize their gear, and thus their role and fighting style along the way.  All in all, a fun little strategy RPG that definitely stands out as being unique in a crowded genre.","January 10, 2015","true","29.9"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","14","21","2","0"

I’d compare it a little to Witcher II with the level of depth and detail.\nThe backstory has been well thought out, and you really feel like you are playing a role in a larger plan.\n\nThe rumors, and stories you hear and read about in the game are interesting, and I've read each of them. Usually in a game like Skyrim, I'd read a few, and then just skip the rest. The stories all tie in very well with the game and atmosphere, the writing is really top notch. There are some typos, and some bits that did not translate well to english, but you'll still catch the meaning.\n\nThe combat system is easy to grasp and enjoyable. The rules are simple, but you must make use of some strategy to maximize the damage you can deal to the enemy, and prevent yourself from taking too much damage. Injured party members can be healed with spells, potions, and local temples, but those all cost money, and money is sometimes difficult to come by.\n\nIf you play the game, read some of the forum post stickies as they offer additional insight into the game mechanics. There are also some YouTube videos that show some easy tips to follow. For instance, it was not until chapter 2 that I realized the map could rotate! The right mouse button is your friend in this game. RMB everything and see what it shows and does.\n\nOne of my favorite parts of the game is the inventory system when you go into a market or store. It is just like most games with a buy/sell system, but if you click on a party member, the store items rearrange themselves and turn different colors. It is almost like each party member has a wishlist of the equipment they want. If you have the money, buy the green stuff at the top pf the list! This is so much better than reading and comparing stats between multiple weapons to determine if a certain sword is better than a certain heavy mace.\n\nMy least favorite part of the game WAS starting over at each chapter. I say WAS, because now that I know to expect it, I can prepare for it. Sure, you lose your awesome party members that you trained from a lowly peasant to a war steed riding knight of death, but you get to do it all over again, and this time you’ll make even better choices. There are a few times when you get to carry over two party members, so you don't always have to start fresh.\n\nI finished the game in 54 hours. I'm planning to play through again and see if I can find some of the stuff I missed on the first playthrough.\nI got stuck at one battle in the game (chapter 4?), and was unable to go any further without cheating. I'm sure this is because I'm not great with the combat tactitcs yet. The developer put some combat scenarios on his site to go through, and I'm unable to beat the first one... Supposedly it took the developer several tries as well, but I've done a dozen variations and keep getting wiped out.","December 29, 2015","true","54.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

It's set in medievel Germany and is more reality based, with "low" magic, mainly healing and buffs, no conjuring demons or firing huge bolts of fire, and your opponents are human knights/ men-at-arms/etc (at least so far through the middle of the 3rd scenario).  The quests are varied and a number have multiple options for resolution. T he artwork/graphics are appropriate for the game/setting, while the music is great.  The skill trees are not complicated, maybe too simplistic for some people, and skills are generally passive or applied automatically in combat (I would have preferred a skill tree that gave me a choice of different attacks in combat) but the system works.\n\nMy main complaint is tha some of the quests are too obscure.  You do need to talk to people, and you really need to think about what you need to do and who might be able to assist you.  But some quests have multiple stages and triggering one stage or another turns into a pixel hunt on the map because you have to be exactly at X point  (or pretty close to it)to trigger the next stage.  This is just frustrating, once I get in the general area, the nex stage should trigger, don't make me pixel hunt.\n\nThe other complaint is that in the main game you move from scenario to scenario, and with each move you lose the troops you raised, trained and equipped in the prior scenario.  You also lose money and anything in your inventory other that what you have equipped.  It works in the game but if you aren't expecting it, you'll wonder what happened.  That said, I would have preferred carrying over troops - it's kind of frustrating to build them up through battle only to loose them when  moving the next scenario.\n\nAll that said, despite the things I don't like, I'm enjoying the game.  The story is interesting, the quests are varied, and the location/period is pretty good.  Overall, a thumbs up.","August 2, 2015","true","105.9"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

I am fond of playing it. It has really enjoyable story, however, there are some who claim opposite point of view. It is surprising how few people think obvious quests would be desirable think hard about what it would entail. Simplification is the way to bored game play. There is not any quests in this game which have no logical solution, however, only thing that you should do is be attentive and collect all gossips in taverns.\n\nThe idea that hero should hold his/here comrades to the next level is ambiguous. I agree, it is hard to lose your high-leveled team mates, but all the time storyline give us solid arguments why it would be. In my opinion, it is a feature, and, of course, good game design decision. Anyway, the greatest developers achievement in this game is that they create an  medieval atmosphere when you feel like a small fish between nasty sharks, and this is awesome.\n\nHowever, it would be irrational to dismiss problem like main character level-upping out of hand. I think, ability tree and interminable feeling of improving are inextricably linked, that the essence of the RPG game. Probably, vast majority of players would be eager to see bigger ability tree with more branches even if every single level-up be less effective, rather than when it small.\n\nI urge anyone who love RPG games with enjoyable, original story and tactical battles to play it.\n","August 3, 2015","true","89.8"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

Also, the quest system is truly old school. No hand holding walk in a theme park here. (perhaps a tad bit too cryptic sometimes but that might just be me being a little slow ..).\n\nThen you got the combat mechanics : If you're a Turn based fan like I am, this game is quite the treat. Look quite simple at first but reveal its subtlety progressively as you're making your way through some hard fought battles and therefore more satisfying victories. In more than 60 hours I played in the main campaign, at no point the combats felt tedious, actually I was always asking for more !..\n\nDon't let its indie game looks deceive you, this one is a gem ! With devs who not only crafted a solid game but are very dedicated to insure their players get the best of it, through support on the forums and quick patches on very little number of issues (encountered the first one after some 40 hours of playtime), big editors should take example !..\n\nNow I just cross my fingers this "little" wonder generates enough revenues for its authors so they can expand it in the future.

Great combat system that feels more like battle chess than DnD.  The story is alright so far, the lore is interesting enough that I didn't just ignore all of the sidequests.  The day/night cycle was a surprise the first time I saw it, with shadows stretching and shrinking as the sun moved east to west.  Really cool, very beautiful.  I also enjoy that unlike some similar games, they give you full control of the camera's rotation, but keep the camera centered on your party, so your eye of God advantage is somewhat muted while you can still fully appreciate the visuals.\n\nThis being an early access game, there are a lot of bugs that make it difficult to advance the story.  So far I've made note of 22 major bugs that either cause ctd problems, or are effecting quests so that workarounds are required, or are completely disrupting advancement progress.  This is quite a large number of problems for a relatively short play time.  There are also many minor bugs as well, from corrupt textures and spelling errors to even some Russian dialogue that hasn't been replaced yet.\n\nThe dev posting on the game's steam forum mentioned that they aren't proud of the UI, but work is being done to improve it.  I'm really looking forward to seeing the work done to it, as its probably the game's largest non-technical weakness.  It's not very intuitive at all, the map is functional but clunky, quest markers sometimes mislead you and accidentally doing part of a quest out of order can make the journal quite confusing.\n\nI bought it at the sale price, and I feel like I've gotten some very good value for my investment and recommend others who are interested to to buy it while it's cheap as well.  If I'd paid full price for the game, I'd honestly regret not waiting until it was complete.  I look forward to keeping track of the progress of Eisenwald as the game comes closer to a full release, as it has potential to be a dark horse that will really surprise and delight many old school fans of this genre.","August 10, 2014","true","8.5"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

Just because it's Early Access, I like how the game is going and whatnot, and I want them to continue improving!\n\nGameplay: this is a hardcore RPG. Turn based, Hex based combat, upgrade your characters, and their equipment, take castles, and cities. It's pretty good. It's a good user interface, gameplay works well. It's really addictive. I'm only on the third chapter, but I'm looking forward to the rest. This game is going to be HUGE!\n\nSoundtrack: My wife often asks me who's playing with the soundtrack on this game, excellent music.\n\nI don't really have anything negative to say about this game. It's early access so yes, there's the minor bug here and there, but it's extremely playable, and really good. Anything I have issue with, has been said already, and will be addressed in future updates. The dev's are pretty awesome on working on what the players say.

But as of the comment left bellow, i have revisited and played some more.\n\nOld Lag Issues: 10/10\nMy main original issue has been resolved and i can now play the game without lag from what seems to be a graphics setting issue. I hope the game devs put an option in thier load gui to choose graphics card use. This may resolve people issues when starting the game on a laptop. But at least the problem is now fixed. Thanks Devs.\n\nGraphics: 6/10\nThe game does look nice in its design, but could definitely use some polishing thoughout. As it is just released i will give it time to improve. cliffs looks somewhat smudged and the water to land merge is rather simple. On the other side the tree foliage is nicely seperate and there is a fair amount of drtail in the buildings.\n\nCombat System: 5/10\nThis is left me lacking with enthusiasm to be honest. You have three rows and each row can only have on it specific types, melee front, range middle, support rear. The middle and back row are not movers and the front row have nowhere to move but forward. This system could be completely revamp with larger battle areas maybe 3 times bigger and have a rang for bows that wasnt the entire map. Thus making the combat system a little more idepth and challenging. As it stands a fair amount of similar games do this aspect of combat far better.\n\nQuesting: 6/10\nThe quests are you average thing in the game, go here do this go here kill that. Nothing i havn't already seen but i do realise that sometimes its hard to be completely original in this area, in this type of game.\nMap controls: 6/10\nOver all the point and click aspect of the game is a little confusing to start with due to its click to start click to stop settings. Most other games deal with a click to start and then a click to move the way point. Although annoying at first i did get used to the feel. Maybe some refinement in this area wouldn't go a miss.\n\nThe Inventory: 7/10\nPritty standard type inventory, items are easy to find and the drag and drop system isnt anythign to shout about, but it does do the job and it will not inpeed your gaming with an over confusing interface.\n\nThe Map and Journal: 6/10\nPritty standard map holding all standard map icons. The relevent is displayed when needed. I would like to see some better design on the quest identfying features. A highlight of the area in regards to the quest itself would be nice. Maybe a colour on the map when you hover over he quest or a blip of some description.\n\nCampaign Map: 6/10\nThe campaign map follows your character through the world an although this is a nice thing, it would be good to be able to detach the camera for a look around the world.\n\nShortcut Keys: 5/10\nQ and J for quest and journal page press once to open and then again to close, great. doesnt work for inventory, I opens but doesn't close. Just an observation on this point.\n\nOverall: 6.5/10\nMostly a positive experience with this game and im sure it will get better as development continues and people create things in the workshop. I do hope however the developers dont use this as an excuse to leave the game in its current state. Or slow down the development to a snails pace.\n\nBut after my current play though i can now say that i can recommend you give the game a try with a score of 6.5 / 10","November 7, 2014","true","2.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cosmicengine/recommended/246760/","cosmicengine","Cosmic Engine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cosmicengine/","309 products in account","https://youtu.be/-ZdnWlWLF-4\n\nThe combat is a simple turn based hex system that simply requires you to attack and defend. The combat is the biggest let down of the entire game. Unlike most turn based combat games, you don’t have freedom of movement. Instead you can only move when you want to attack a target. There’s no tactical positioning or moving your units out of range of archers. All that is every required in combat is a few simple clicks and while there are unit abilities and some spells, there is very little in terms of actual tactical depth. The sheer lack of freedom of movement in the combat can really hinder you at points, it means you can’t have your spearman on the right flank just move over to the left to defend against a mounted foe, instead the enemies closest to them, even if they are a couple of hexes away must be cleared out first.\n\nThe over world works in real time, as you move so do others, time can be stopped, slowed or sped up at convenience. The overworld brings back found memories of the Heroes of Might and Magic series, legends pulls it all of well, with great landscapes and graphical assets. While the movement is slow, the developers have done a good job of making the world look alive. Characters have different routines, which are also affected by quests and the day/night cycle. For example, if you’re hunting down a thief, it’s likely you won’t find him during the day. Instead you’ll have to lay in wait, fast forward time and wait for him to come out at night. The movement is fairly slow on the overworld which can get pretty irritating when you’re trying to catch up with a certain character.\n\nThe questing in Legends is a mixed bag of both relatively ok quests and some that are fairly tedious endeavors. The major issue for me was the lack of any meaningful choice system in the game which I certainly felt was due to the lack of creativity quest wise. The majority of main quests consist of running around to talk to a few people and a fight and that’s it, it’s all pretty much rinse and repeat after that in various forms. Questing in legends provides a shallow experience, there’s really very little depth to it, however what it lacks in quality it makes up in quantity. There’s a lot to do in the game and some of it I had no idea what I was supposed to be doing. This was thanks the vague quest instructions, which don’t get me wrong, I love figuring things out for myself and dislike games that hand hold the entire way through, however the obscurity of the quests were bad and artificially elongated quests that would have otherwise been very short, it also adds artificial difficulty to simple things.\n\nNow like I mentioned the games story isn’t bad if you can forgive the odd writing at times. However with there are a couple of uncomfortable moments by modern standards in there such as some remarks against Jews that certainly could be considered as Anti-sematic, do I think the developers are racist? No of course not. It’s clear they tried to reflect the times however the small remarks to other races add nothing to the actual setting and story and could have gone amiss.\nGraphically, Legends of Eisenwald does well, it’s not terrible to look at and the character models are done fairly well. The character animations look off and janky on occasion particularly in combat. The art style of the game could have done with a little more color as everything is done in a dark shade of color with little actual vibrancy. It’s not that a darker tone is bad, it’s that mixed with the shallow mechanics, it makes the game look bland and ugly in places, when it doesn’t need to be. The most disappointing side of the art was the lack of character assets with soldiers all looking like clone troopers from star wars. Each character looks of that class looks the exact same, for example three monks are identical clones which breaks any and all immersion when in combat. The soundtrack of the game isn’t bad but doesn’t particularly stand out in anyway, the only thing that did stand out about the audio was the few bugs that would cause the audio to go off.\n\nOverall Legends of Eisenwald has a lot of content but lacks any depth to its mechanics. It’s rough around the edges but does hold a certain charm to it. It’s certainly entertaining and packs plenty of hours in there to get your monies worth. I think people looking for an RPG with more depth to progression, combat and certainly a better quality story may wish to wait for a sale before buying Legends","August 19, 2015","true","11.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There are also a few translation errors, but those are a bit minor. Only improvement I can think of right now is the expansion of the quests. A few of the quests have a 'choice' option but as you progress the choices are made for you, forcing you to do something that you otherwise would not have done in gameplay.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sebathius/recommended/246760/","Sebathius","Sebathius","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sebathius/","366 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI'm very mixed about my review, especially since this game is in early access level and in the middle of being worked on. I really REALLY want to like this game and my pros almost outweigh the cons but after careful consideration Ive come to the conclusion that overall unless they make some drastic changes to the game, I wouldnt in good conscience recommend it. Now its not a very expensive game, so maybe its still worth trying it out and finding out if you can ignore the major cons that pushed the scales out of balance for me. My review is purely informative, though I have to admit the game's frustration level outweighed my objectionable standing.\n\nWhile this game looks much like Heroes of Might and Magic and Kings Bounty in how the combat system looks and overall map systems are designed and played, the combat you would expect and how static buildings are handled are very different. If you are looking for another version of M&M or Kings Bounty, This game is not it.\n\nCombat takes place with single units instead of mass groups, and limitations on how many units you can have are based on how many castles you own. The castles only other benefit is that if you are attacked while in a castle, before your army is engaged the opposing unit gets wounded based on its level and defense. Siege equipment is not present at this time in this game at all.\n\nSo far from I have seen, you have a starting base of six units you can have (including your hero) and you get an additional unit per castle you own. For example, if you have one castle you can support one hero, two foot troops, two archers, a healer, and a priest. Im going to break down what the units are like in Pros (because I do like their versions) and other ideas the game excelled and is severely hampered by below.\n\nPros and Cons:\n\nPros:\n\nMakes great use of the German historical background and some of its mythos. It really tries to immerse you in that culture of the medieval dark periods in its campaign.\n\nThe art and music is by far enticing like few games out there and makes great effort to keep in the tradition of Germanic arms and equipment of the time period.\n\nEquipment is very easy to understand in terms of bonuses they apply to your units.\n\nThe Tutorial slowly integrates you into the functions of the game rather well.\n\nUnits consist of Melee, Ranged, Healing, Buffing, and limited Magic classes that really well integrate into the historical setting.\n\nUnits promote into different options and provide interesting additions to your game, each unit can be customized with gear.\n\nWhile combat is predominately a "Con" for me in this game (see below), it does make sense that the front line limits melee from engaging in the secondary and tirtiary line of defense. I sincerely wish games like King's Bounty and M&M had that limitation in their games as well.\n\nThe Journal is very useful though it could be better streamlined when giving you notes in "Additonal Information" on where to find quests..I stumbled around a lot trying to find some locations that are not immediately available unless you find yourself close to them.\n\n\nCons:\n\nMovement in combat is a happenstance; Melee units are directed by the computer towards specific targets. a Melee unit cannot move just anywhere on the hex board, they may delay their action to move them to the bottom of the turn line once, but hereafter MUST engage in units directed by the computer with no other alternatives. If they do not have skills that they can use instead (for example, if you have a peasant that would most likely die if he engages with another by himself) he must engage since he has no other skills to avoid that engagement. A unit's only other move instead of to engage into combat (outside of skills like parry, counter strike, as an example), is to retreat one or two spaces from an already engaged fight.\n\nHealers, Mages, and Ranged Units cannot move except to retreat from a melee unit. They can only do their functions such as attack or heal, they are rooted to the spot otherwise. There's no moving to a better position in this game at all, and when suggested to the developers that this is a weakness to the game, they were steadfast that this would never change, as it would require a complete rework of the programming.\n\nThis may be a condition of the early access situation, so this one is not a severe con since it can be reworked or streamlined, but it should be mentioned. Sometimes healers will not have certain targets available to heal, regardless of how wounded the unit may be. Ive contacted the developers on the topic and I was assured the game is working properly and that most likely the unit was trying to buff the units instead of healing them since as healers are promoted they get multiple spell options. This was not the case but by the response I was pretty sure there was no point in discussing the matter anymore (especially after the pointless conversation to cover movement in combat).\n\nThe Market has a major limitation in that you cannot take something that your units are wearing and swap it out for something else. In order to upgrade, you must first buy the item you want, leave the market, switch items, go back to the market and then sell the item.\n\nIn the second chapter of the campaign game, four different leaders ask you to destroy two of their opponents for them to help you. One of those leaders sits in the large town and is not accessable in order to destroy that opponent. You can take his castles and land holdings but it will not count towards destroying him unless you confront him as well. Once you declare war on him, he will no longer be accessable.\n\nThe campaign in the third chapter is rather punishing. You are limited to jump through obstacles that require you to wait on other enemy units (which I dont want to spoil it for you, so Im being perposefully vague here) and at the same time are run down by an impossible adversary that requires you to keep on the run. After trying to play that section as specified by the game by its rules, I finally gave up when that impossible adversary showed up.\n\n\nIn conclusion, at this moment while I believe the game has extreme potential, unless they make changes to the combat system I cant emphatically suggest or recommend such a game system...especially since a game like this is anchored around its combat system. The campaign is nothing without it. If changes occur during development of course Ill be happy to come in and redo my review when (or if) that happens.","August 14, 2014","false","16.0"," 26 of 51 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","26","51","0","6"

As mentioned by many here the game is completely shallow and in no way compared to any 4x games out there. At the strategical level there is no empire building at all. You have one wandering party you control with simplistic recruiting. There are a few wandering mobs to fight.\n\nAt the tactical level there is no depth. Even ignoring the lack of spell effects and other graphical elements there is no combat gird that you can use. You have no control over where your units get positioned in battle and really it matters very little anyways as there are no deep game mechanics that make that useful (Like FF tactics os any RPG strat game).\n\nYou merely click on an enemy, and your character will walk the ENTIRE length of the combat field to that person and mindlessly attack. The AI is absent completely, and is why these features are not there. There is some very crude path-finding and a simplistic algorithm for targeting units which the AI uses and that is it.\n\nCharacter customization is a farce. You can change the way your shield and weapon look. That is it. So don't get fooled into thinking you can customize your character.\n\n\nOh and by the way, you cannot level your character in this game. Its bugged right now, when you load up your game from a save it forgets all of your upgrades in the skill tree. So you will be a level 6 character with no skills. This game should not be on steam it makes me doubt every indy developer out there.","September 7, 2014","false","10.0"," 16 of 34 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","16","34","0","4"

With too few tactical options and somewhat unclear rules, it fails to impress and STRONGLY encourages save-scumming. All in all, the game’s neither good nor bad - an okay-ish, relaxing experience that I (unfortunately) cannot wholeheartedly recommend, not for the full price. 5+/10 or 6/10 at best.\n\nLONG VERSION: The combat lacks depth. Let’s define depth as “the number of meaningful choices a player can make at any given moment”. If you consider that a.) you can’t freely move the units, b.) you can only attack the nearest enemy unit and c.) there are hardly any special attacks, abilities etc., the player often feels like there’s very little he can change (it feels almost like auto-resolve at times, you just do the clicking, not the decision-making). For example, if you have a warrior (a young noble, let’s say) and it’s his turn, you can only do 3 things (apart from drinking a potion): attack the nearest foe, postpone the attack on said foe or skip his turn entirely in exchange for a defence bonus in the next turn. There should be more tactical options like:\n\n- special attacks (e.g. a shield bash that does little to no damage, but lowers the defence of the target so that you could have a specialized character with high initiative that would make the enemy vulnerable to your slower (low initiative), but hard-hitting characters),\n\n- will points (limited points that you can use up to make the attacks stronger or more accurate or whatever; it worked great in The Banner Saga, why not here?),\n\n- flanking mechanics, defence penalties for being attacked by several enemies and, generally speaking, the ability to move your troops more freely (even if there’s a penalty for that); seriously, why do I have mounted troops if I can’t go behind the enemy line and kill that pesky healer in turn 1? That’s what cavalry does, flank and charge,\n\n- more “spells” (or at least alternative, stronger versions of the same “spells” which you have to “charge up” for a turn and which can fail if the caster takes damage in the meantime),\n\nImagine for a moment that we have all these options. I just lost a battle, what do I do? Fight again and try a different approach, move my troops differently, defend my crossbowman this time, use up all the will points to eliminate that mystic as quickly as possible, or lower the defence of that tank-ish knight with a special attack etc. Lots of possibilities, as you can see. Now back to reality. I just lost a battle in Legends of Eisenwald, what do I do? Reload the game, ask myself why I failed and SAVE-SCUM by using that knowledge to modify my army (shift their initial positions, give some weapons or armour to different people, go back to a village to buy a potion or recruit a different person). See the difference? It’s breaks the immersion if your character is a psychic who can predict what will happen next :)\n\nSo I’m not saying there’s no depth to the combat system. The problem is that the meaningful choices occur BEFORE the battle. Once you engage in combat, there’s very little you can do to change the outcome. And for me, that’s not much fun at all. I watched combat videos made by the devs to see if the situation changes in the mid- and late-game, but no, it doesn’t.\n\nAlso, as I already mentioned, the game doesn’t make the rules clear enough. Why does the spearman sometimes counterattack and sometimes he doesn’t? Is there any defence penalty from being surrounded? Why can I sometimes choose the direction of the attack and sometimes I can’t? And so on.\n\nWhen it comes to the RPG elements, I didn’t play the game long enough to say anything about the story, but as I said, there are too few stats and skills for the game to actually FEEL like an RPG. Also, there’s no character creation whatsoever, which is sad. You can only choose the class and change the name so you don’t have to play as Heinrich.\n\nOverall, it’s not a bad game and some people will find it pretty fun (might as well give it a try when it's on sale and, if you feel about the combat system the way I do, you can always get a refund...). Personally, I may play it for a few more hours, but I have to say I’m disappointed (I was waiting for this game when it was still in early access). Too bad, because it definitely had potential.","October 25, 2015","false","3.8"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","8","18","0","3"

The battles, when you get over the dodgy pathfinding/target selection issues are fine. Nothing revolutionary but how much can you improve a turn-based, hex-grid combat sequence?\nThis game makes you work. Its not handed to you on plate. Neither does it treat you like an idiot.\nAnd, once I got over my initial pre-conceptions and actually got into the game, I enjoyed wandering around the map, fighting and exploring. So all in all it doesn't sound that bad right? Well, for me, the problem is all the hours I invested in building up a little force, equipping them, choosing upgrades and deciding which partciular career path they were going to take. Then, you complete the current mission and whammo! There you are........alone......... and almost penniless. Your team has gone! All that time and effort you put in was for absolutely nothing!\nNow you kinda anticipate that when you get to the next mission the baddies are going to be tougher and better equipped (this is a TBS game after all), so you naturally want to take your team so you can cope with next mission, yes? Wel, no. What happens is you are droppped into the next map with only your characters gear and enough money to buy a bowl of gruel, should you happen upon an establishment that sells bowls of gruel, which you won't.\nThe very next mission sees me recruiting a base level healer and two pitchfork wielding peasants. Have a guess how long they lasted against the pursuing bandits. Not very long at all., They die. There's nowhere else to recruit anymore peasants from and there are several waves of bandits heading your way that you simply cannot escape. It is totally pointless.\nLike I said at the top of this review, I really did want to like this game. I'm long in the tooth as a gamer. I go back to 1993  and The commodore Amiga and TBS games are my thing. But this one, well, my advice is not to bother.

That alone made this game a lot more frustrating, when making things just a bit easier or just a bit more apparent would have tipped the balance.\n\nThe overhead map movement is an exercise in frustration because finding the correct path through the terrain isn't always immediately obvious. This led to a lot of pixel-hunting, something I thought we got rid of in the late 90s.\n\nUI is a bit of a mess, as well. One commenter noted that upgrading was a bit of a chore, since there isn't a way to figure out what unit upgrades do; unlike your hero upgrades, there's no tooltip to explain what an upgrade does, so choosing and saving/reloading was the norm. I stumbled upon this completely by accident, but right-clicking the upgrade tree for your units shows a tooltip of their upgraded abilities. I have no idea why this wasn't included in a regular hover tooltip, and this could have more clearly been highlighted in the tutorial.\n\nFinally, there are a lot of game moments where everything just feels unfair, without much warning. Spoiler alert: in the third act, you face zombies, which would be fine and dandy if I'd known that some units that are afraid of zombies will desert your army completely. I was put in an unwinnable situation since I'd chosen the ranged hero, and my whole front line disappeared. There isn't much build-up to this at all, and that alone put the stopper on any desire I had to play onwards.\n\nAll in all, not recommended.","October 3, 2015","false","15.9"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

On the positive side it has a well developed story line.  But...\n\nThere is a problem with the engine - long delays on the menus and much lower frame rates than my rig gets on comparable graphics in other games.\n\nThere are some technical problems which give the overall impression the game was made by amateurs. The most notable are:\n\nYou have hardly any control over the field of view. You can pan and tilt only a tiny amount. This means you have to click many times to move. To make it worse, movement isn't smooth. Instead of continuing when you click in a second place, the character stops. Overall, movement is horribly clunky.\n\nYour fighters' character screens always say they are level 1 regardless of their true level.\n\nThe text has a lot of terrible errors. In a few places it even refers to the main character as a man when she is a woman.\n\nThe quest map markers don't update so they tell you to go to places where you have nothing more to do.\n\nIf you move a mounted character's lance to inventory the game crashes.\n\nOverall it has to get a thumbs down. There are many many much better games in this genre.","September 18, 2015","false","132.9"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","3"

On the surface it looks even better than I expected it to be. I mean, we are starting to see a lot of good-looking Early Access games, but still it surprises me. I do like myself a good tactics game as most of you well know, so I wasn’t about to pass this opportunity up.\n\nThe main pull for myself to Legends of Eisenwald was the combat. That’s also the first disappointment as well. It’s on a hex system, but there’s not as much depth to the combat as I was hoping, but it is rather brutal and fast… kind of like a medieval skirmish would be I presume. You’ve got rear healers and buffs, then your ranged and then your “tanks”. I use air-quotes because as of writing this, really only my main dude is a tank. Everyone else is more like a meat-shield. You can either start to attack the top half or the bottom half with your main character if he’s in the middle as is the default, but everyone else just kind of moves forward to the guy closest to him. This is the fight. You can’t have everyone just jump to one guy at the beginning of the fight, but rather you are forced to fight the closest opponent. If realism was the intention, they got because that does make the most logical sense. Tactics-wise… you can’t change the positioning of your guys before the fight, but rather before you even enter the fight and see how they are aligned and then it’s too late. There are no obstacles, just people and it feels like a different combat system would have worked better here. Maybe a 2.5D isometric combat system?\n\nThe main pull for myself to Legends of Eisenwald was the combat. That’s also the first disappointment as well. It’s on a hex system, but with no real depth.

There are no obstacles, just people and it feels like a different combat system would have worked better here. Maybe a 2.5D isometric combat system?\n\nThe story is that you leave your home to go off somewhere and fight only to come back home and find that there is infighting at home. Lame, but dems the brakes. The writing and story in Legends of Eisenwald is pretty solid. I’ve enjoyed most of if not all that I’ve encountered so far. It’s both interesting and intriguing but it seems to be held back by the game proper. The quest log is somewhat useful, but not very. I was once told to go to the southern bridge near a watch tower… there wasn’t one. It will guide you to some places, but not all (which is fine, I can read, but still). You also don’t have too much money, but you’re told to go and hire people to help you out. They cost money per day, but that didn’t come off as obvious to me and I still don’t really see it anywhere listed. The button just says hire not pay this amount each day. (Goodbye money.)\n\nLegends of Eisenwald doesn’t feel too much like your traditional RPG either where you can go off and explore, killing bad guys for loot and money and generally getting the lay of the land. You need more money and I’m believing that is only going to happen while following the story. There is nothing wrong with a linear game, but Legend of Eisenwald doesn’t feel like it was intended to be that way. It gives the feeling like it was supposed to be more open. Maybe you just have to pay your dues and follow the story for it to open up to you later, but that’s not really how I play RPG’s. I wonder off and kill bad-guys and take their money… but the bad guys are mostly broke here.\n\nScore: Wait For Some Updates\n\nI don’t give this score lightly. I really wanted to give Legends of Eisenwald the better of the two impression scores, but while it has a lot of potential, I feel it will probably be more worth it after a few more updates. I enjoyed the story. If they wouldn’t call it a tactics game, I probably would have enjoyed the combat more. The music was good. The overall game as a whole just feels like it’s missing something, maybe it’s better direction (please don’t read that as hand-holding), but when you’ve done a decent job running around questing, but can’t quite figure out how to turn in some of them and run yourself into a place where your only real option is to start over completely… I’m just not a fan. I’ll keep checking on this game and let you know if my opinion changes, but as of right now Legends of Eisenwald I feel like it’s a solid “wait”. Unless you like what they are presenting and want to support them in their endeavor that is (which is completely understandable.)","April 23, 2015","false","8.7"," 8 of 20 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","8","20","0","8"

Yet you have a combat modifier on ranged being over 3 hexs away for damage (despite the fact you cannot move closer to mitigate that modifier). Also if you go with a spellcaster at low levels he cannot cast damage spells at range (which is absolutely ludicrous a book reading spell caster IS NOT going to wait for you to get next to him to cast Flambe')so you cannnot move next to them to cast this and have to wait for them to get right next to you. This reaks of a designer that always feels that spellcasters are always OP. Well I like spellcasters so up urs ******berry. If you have such a probelm with them make them glass cannons. Nobody has a problem with that because as we all know Conan is a tough hombre and he may still kick your taint to the stars after you have napalmed him. Next and not in the least insignifigant if your forest is beautiful and your mountains are beautiful and the get in the way of me properly navigating the map then, ITS BEAUTY IS TOTALLY LOST ON ME. That having been said as far as I could tolerate these issues it had a decent although simplistic story line and it could have really been really good bang for your buck if these simple issues had been fixed. If you're anything like me you will be cussing in no time at all. Once again that having been said if they fix these issues in a patch and I play it and see them fixed i will most likely revise or add an addendum to this reveiw. thank you for reading this friend.","April 17","false","10.1"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

They all have good ideas behind, but the way they are implemented, just feels bad... really bad. The main story gets fuzzy and the quests are confusing and bugged.

The controls are wonky and unneccesarliy difficult.  Example: the save game default to a long string including current date.  If you want to name your saves you have to backspace ONE KEY AT A TIME.  You can't just hold the backspace key, you must hit 15 times.  That probably doesn't sound like a big deal and in isolation it wouldn't be but combine that with multiple other klunky UI issues and it just becomes a frustrating mess.\n\nThe quests directions are unbelievably obtuse, not challenging, not though provoking, but obtuse and frequently downright wrong. Example:  on one quest you are told to seek a man by the south gate of a town when the shadow of the tower reaches the big stone.  Except there is no south gate of the town and the tower (providing you are lucky enough to guess the one intended) doesn't actually cast shadows.  While I will give the devs credit for being active on the boards answering questions, they actually answered this one wrong.  They said to go by the big rock (which rock???) at dawn but it turns out you have to be at the north side of a bridge at dusk.   Gah, what a cluster.\n\nI can't vouch for it myself because a bug prevented me from getting past chapter 1 but apparently if you are able to progress, at the end of each chapter you lose the party members you've spent the past 6 hours levelling up and have to start from scratch.\n\nI had followed this game since it was Kickstarted and desperately wanted to like it but I deeply the purchase even though I bought it on sale for less than $5.

When I first reviewed the game I found the concept to be great and the battle system to be so, so, but this has changed. The battle system while still being potentially lengthy Is now something to truely enjoy the visuals have improved (thought I must say its hard to say how much) and everythign has a much smootherflow really giving you alot of choice. Bugs of course have been fixed for the most part as they often do over time.\nThis game is soon to be released and I would recommend it to most people.\n\n\nAugust 2014-This game had potential the battle system was nice the graphics good but the story line can get confusing and sometimes quests are never ending due to bugs\nfurther it is impossible to come across enough loot to keep yourself well equiped and healed.\ntried to play this game multiple times each time disapointing.","August 27, 2014","true","47.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

It has potential but it's really time to show something for that potential. In my play through I wasn't overly impressed, very few customization options and the story felt like a railroad.  Go there, do this, beat that, go there.\n\nUpdated 11/7/15\n\nThe finished game is quite pleasant to play. Occasionally I do get lost on some quests untill I run into the right village/ building (some more hints as to what to do next would be helpfull, running around the map and visiting everuwhere whenever stuck is tedious) etc but overall its quite nice.\nCombat is crisp and quick and there is more involved then you'd think at first view. I do miss an option to skip a turn entirely though or to move and not attack (for an archer for instance to flank someone with a shield.)\nThe atmosphere is good, music is well picked and there is a nice bunch of stories/ lore woven into the game all adding to the playability.\n\nI haven't gotten to chapter 4 yet so I'll reserve comment there for now but chapter two is fun and chapter three seems much improved.\n\nAll in all worth playing so changing my recommandation on the finished product.","October 27, 2014","true","65.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

It mixes smart tactical combat, solid looting and leveling gameplay, good art, amazing music, a sense of immersion I struggle to find nowadays in games (I'm an older gamer) and an absolutely great story.\n\nThe tactical combat looks  simple but surely it isn't. It is a smart and different take than HOMM series, as you have to act with your units, and move is a consequence of the attack order. Every action you have a series of decision to make and it is very interesting for a long time.If you are an experienced strategy gamer, however, if you don't go for the higher difficulties it could be a bit too easy, and after while it gets a bit repetitive, but until there it is very fun.\n\nThe leveling and looting system makes managing your party interesting. There is a nice variety of loot and troops, and simple but rewarding upgrade trees.\n\nThe story is top notch, though the storytelling is a bit lacking. Some say it is complicated and really is, you have to pay attention. I would say the story is on par with King of Dragon Pass. You don't have a lot of choices, though, as the story unfolds, but the quality makes for it. The worldbuilding is awesome as well, you really feels like you are in medieval Germany.\n\nAt the end of the campaign the gameplay gets a bit repetitive, though, but is mostly a case of the campaigtn being too long than the gameplay being boring. I only kept going for the story.\n\nOverall, a great game. 8.5/10","July 5, 2015","true","74.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are excessive load times and wait times between screens. For example in the equipment screen changing from one character to the next requires a pause of several seconds before the change even occurs. I was unable to spend any serious time playing it due to these issues.\n\ni5 3GHz Intel Quad Core\n2 x 770 GTX SLI\n32 GB RAM\n\nEdit: The developers were kind enough to get in touch with and recommended some suggestions through the FAQ to resolve these slow-loading issues for both the loading screen and in-game UI elements. However, after adding the game to my antivirus (Webroot) allowed list and even attempting to run the game with my antivirus completely turned off the issues were not resolved. I have the latest nVidia drivers as well. While I am thankful they contacted me my issues are still not resolved and I have an essentially unplayable game in my library.\n\nEdit July 7, 2015\n\nI re-installed today after being contacted by the developer notifying me that the game had left Early Access and was fully released. The issues I faced in the Early Access review are no longer present. The game runs smoothly.\n\nThe combat takes a bit of adjustment since you can't move your characters to specific locations - you can only move-to-attack the nearest enemy. This makes defending with melee units more important to prevent your ranged / support rows from being isolated. You can modify the equipment for your troops (new swords, armor, weapon types, etc.) I like that different weapon types have different advantages (swords allow counterattacks, maces stun, etc.) I haven't gotten too far in to the campaign yet but will update now that the stutter issue I faced is no longer present.","July 3, 2014","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","6"
