I have a FX-8320 and a GTX 970. I'm getting 60+ FPS with the whole grid on ultra.\nThe handling model. I have a G27 and I am happy with the FFB and the physics have vastly improved, especially compared to F1 2014.\n\nCons:\nNo safety car. I don't know Codemasters reasoning for this but I personally feel it takes away from the game.\nThis game crashes more than Maldonado. Ran a benchmark, crashed. Tried online, crashed. Started pro season mode, crashed. You get the idea.\nLittered with bugs. For now there is only one that I find truly game breaking. When I play Pro season mode, (for those who dont know, it is supposed to turn off all HUD and assists and locks you into cockpit cam) I still have all the assists on and since the menu is greyed out I can't manually turn them off.\n\nI would advise anybody interested in this game, to be patient and wait for future fixes and then consider a purchase.\n\nMay update this in the future. 10/07/15\n------------------------------------------------------------\n24 hours of game time later I feel it is time to update my review.\n\nFirst off, since my first review they released a 2nd patch on the day of release, which is pathetic that it was even needed in the first place as it wasnt even a large one. Thankfully though it seems to have fixed the game crashing so Pastor can now sit safe and keep his reputation.\n\nThe more I have driven in this game the more and more I'm enjoying racing the AI and the handling model. The Championship season, Quick race and Time trial modes are the ONLY parts of the game I would consider ready to be released. Pro season and Multiplayer however were and STILL ARE NOT READY.\n\nFor the first time in the series you can actually race the AI wheel-to-wheel, and unlike Project Cars there aggresion is about right. The AI are very spacially aware so if you were to dive up there inside they won't turn in on you. They are also very racey themselves as they wont back out 100 metres before a braking zone as before, and will try to outbrake you if you leave the door open. For reference I have the AI on the hardest setting.\n\nHowever I would consider Championship season mode ready,although it does have a few features missing. You can no longer underfuel the car in this game and since you can no longer run rich fuel mix for longer than half a lap before your engine overheats, I end up with around 5 laps of fuel left at the end of a 100% race. You can no longer fully customize your strategy before the race, you can only choose between preselected strategies given to you by your teams strategist and with 100% races, generally speaking you're given 2 options but if you qualify within the top 10 it's normally 1. My final complaint with Championship season mode is the inability to customize the weekend length. There are 3 choices and cant be tweaked. Short weekend- 15 mins practice, one-shot qualifying, 25% race. Normal weekend- 30 mins practice, one qualifying round, 50% race. Long weekend- 1 hour practice, full 3 rounds of qualifying, 100% race.\n\nQuick race works as it should with you being able to actually tweak it to your liking and there's not much else to say. Time Trial has been improved upon now as at most circuits/corners the game is strict with you leaving track limits, but my new favourite feature is you can copy setups from people at the top of the leaderboards. I highly recommend doing this unless you want to be left alone and know what you're doing. My only problem with Time Trial is that at some corners you can still exceed track limits and not have your lap invalidated. Is it really that hard code"masters" to just invalidate laptimes if you exceed track limits with all 4 wheels regardless of time lost/gained?\n\nI feel the need to mention at this point that the F1 2014 season is also included in this game as I'm rather neutral to its integration. Albeit a nice bonus, I bought this game for the 2015 season and would rather have had them focus more time on the current season than the previous one.\n\nThe problem with Pro season mode mentioned in my first review is still there and upon further review  I think there was no real need for Codemasters to even add this mode as you can change your HUD, assist and camera angle in Championship season mode to the exact same settings.\n\nNow the real big-hitter that is Multiplayer. Blandly put, the multiplayer is a mess, there's no two ways about it. From unpredictable ghosting, to desynchonised lobbies, to driving through pit crews, to just straight up random teleporting, multiplayer is completely and utterly broken. With a supposed brand-new netcode, which showcases Codemasters "master" coding, multiplayer has been crippled before even mentioning there new matchmaking system known as "hoppers". The main problem with the new system is the player base gets spread out so much between the different game types that it takes so much longer to find the game even in the first week since release.\n\nAfter having played the game for a longer time period now, I would only recommend this game to people if you are only/mainly interested in the singleplayer experience. If Multiplayer was the main attraction stay clear as if it was a sprintmode lap 1 trainwreck of a pileup.\n\nFurther updates pending upon release of further patches or DLC. 14/07/15","July 9, 2015","false","159.0"," 723 of 801 people (90%) found this review helpful 187 people found this review funny","90","723","801","187","37"

I have been a loyal fan of your racing games since 2007, but what is it with the F1 series? All the opporunity and all the promise and in every release problem after problem after problem. The most stable of the series was probably 2012 (though no FP1 and FP2 and the wet-to-dry transition problems still hurt). F1 2015 - released 2 months earlier than has been typical, and it's not ready for distribution. Let's make a simple and, I think, fair comparison:\n\n- DiRT Rally - came with some bugs, but that was the point right? I mean, it was touted as an Early Release title for which the community feedback has been integral to QAing the game as such that you have been able to appropriately focus your development efforts, and it's worked - immaculately. And... For those of us who got in early, we paid what, 60% of the cost of a full release?\n\n- F1 2015 - where to begin. Evidently from a development perspective, QA cycles have been all but completely omitted it seems. Some of the graphical elements are certainly more polished, and the handling model is refined, but otherwise, this bad-boy is completely smattered with issues. I am running an i7 5820 w/ 64 GB DDR4 and 2 GTX 970s in SLI and I am getting significant amounts of "blur" at assorted points throughout gameplay - not only while driving - it really doesn't look great. I tried "Reset To Track" and my car jumped around in reverse, smoked a wall and came to rest backwards on the track - that was an effect I was able to reproduce. The AI continuously drive up from behind me and smoke me like I'm not even there, sending me off track, damaging my car, and even penalising me. In just two hours of gameplay I had a crash when running benchmark mode, a random crash in the middle of a lap, 2 instances where when I started the game it was unresponsive to keyboard inputs for minutes, timing screens which flicker, setup screens which overlay one another making it virtually impossible to read the two conflicting layers of text, and a desaturated (almost to the point of being entirely greyscale) camera view once I used a flashback. All the points about "I can't make my own character", I personally couldn't care (well, aside from missing the helmet which I have used since F1 2010!), but the base playability MUST be there for full release, and in this case it isn't. Oh, and what's up with giving us PC'ers the option to try to use the voice commands if the functionality was never intended for the platform - it almost seems "mean" - queue up that fat Nelson kid from The Simpsons.\n\nIt's unfortunate that "the pinacle of motorsport" is not represented appropriately, but I guess with the "state of F1" being what it is, what else can be expected?\n\nDiRT, DiRT 2, DiRT Rally, GRID - all amazing unforgettable titles, but F1 - the series has not been executed to the extent it should have been once yet. That's $360 I have been stupid enough to spend on not a single product which actually worked through and through. At this point I am officially turned off as I expect 50% - 60% of the community is, or will be over the coming days, based on the forums so far.\n\nIt's a sad day...\n\n\n\n\n\n**UPDATED**\nMore issues:\nMultiplayer - constant screen flickering - not changes to the settings from when I play in Championship or Pro Season modes.\nEngineer - I cannot hear a word my engineer says even with the car and environment turned down to 50 and the Speech to 100.\nQuit Game - Every time I go to quit game, Steam looks as though it's DLing a patch or something, prior to me getting an Error 41.\nMultiplayer - obviously not a glitch / bug, but Codies, did you really make the decision to include a Custom Multiplayer season where AI racers were not included? Like, I want to do the full season (co-op or adversarial) with a friend, but I can only race him... Yeah, there's no AI - how fun is that? And otherwise I have to find another 18 people to fill the grid and be online for Practice, Qually, and Race distances...","July 10, 2015","false","9.9"," 274 of 318 people (86%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","86","274","318","23","12"

No safety car&virtual safety car, no realistic track limit violation rules, no drive through penalty, completely terrible online system (game constantly causes mass disconnection at certain points) and optimization (especially in online) is terrible. I don't even want to mention no career option.\n\nI heard that Codemasters will take some pre-alpha or beta testers from the real players. If Codemasters keep listening 12-year-old arcade-lover English children who are moaning about "auto-spin" kerbs because they spin on a freaking kerb while using full throttle, this series will lose its only good feature: physics.\n\nYou need to make driving hard (even more understeer because cars are still bloody fast - almost 3 seconds faster than real life, stiffer suspensions, less grip off the racing line, less grip on the racing line in wet surface - because of the rubber - etc.), make online more stable, provide more freedom (driver customization, maybe increasing driver ability options in career mode, also in season development), introduce realistic track limit rules and more strict penalties.\n\nEdit: Well, after the patch that includes "strict corner cutting rules", I have to revise my review. This game still lacks in almost all the fields I explained above. But they listen to us - they added strict corner cutting rules. And now, beta testers give great feedbacks about the game. In F1 2016, there will be safety car and proper career mode. Also, kerbs will be more punishing, throttle application will be harder, ideal racing line and braking points will make more difference, car setups will be even more effective in F1 2016 (F1 2015 responds changes in car setups pretty well in my opinion, they are on the correct path at least). I hope it will be more satisfying in all aspects.\n\nP.S.: By the way, those in previous paragraph are not my predictions. They are actual feedbacks and observations of one of the beta testers.

Although being an improvement from the already mediocre F1 2014, this game feels like a major let down by Codemasters. Lots of promises from them and they fail to deliver once again.\n\nPROS :\n\n-Handling model and steering has been slightly improved from 2014 with the new engine\n-New engine brings nicer graphics and more details to the environment\n-Engine sounds are as good as the real thing\n-AI are less passive and way more aggressive, will race you and pursue their overtaking manouver till the end\n-Team radio has been enhanced, and the talk to engineer voice recognition is a great idea\n\n\nCONS :\n\n-Major lack of features. This game feels absolutely bland. It really hurts to see Career mode gone. Championship mode let you choose an existing driver and pretty much do their season. Gone are the days where your name would shine on the podium along big names in the sport. Pro season is pretty much a Preset Championship mode with 100% Race laps, Legend AIs and manual gears. So much for a feature right ? Multiplayer on your own is nearly impossible, nobody plays this game by the looks of it, every time you'll try to get in a Hopper session, you'll end up in a lobby by yourself and AIs. And even if you can get a few people in the lobby, the races are absolutely hideous. It feels more like a cheap Mario Kart game. Fortunately, Time Trial is still here (thank god for that) and that's about it.\n\n-No safety car. No need to explain. Why remove it ? We will never know.\n\n-AI is absolutely dumb. It was a good thing to make them competitive, but they are aggressive to the point of ignoring you on the track. I had so much drama on race starts because of the AI not taking into consideration that you are on the track and they will just push you out of the way. Before F1 2015, the AI was very defensive and weak, but the beauty of it was that they actually knew that you were on the track. On this game, it feels like they are stuck on a rail just like old racing games from the 1990's.\n\n-Damage model is non existant. Yeah, sure, if you hit the wall at least 50 times and end up losing a wheel, I guess that's what damage model is for Codemasters. Jokes aside, you'd think that in 2015, damage model would be on point and realistic with flying debris compared to older racing games but nope, ain't got time for that, right Codemasters ? You can hit the wall at 300+ kph, you'll probably just lose a wheel and the front wing, that's it. If you collide into a wall at 200kph, you'll lose your front wing, and that's about it...\n\n-Handling model and steering is appauling. When you get an oversteer, you feel like you're steering a boat. Yes, a boat. It's nearly impossible to correct a tiny oversteer or understeer just like you see in real life. When you overtake and go wheel to wheel against someone, just one hit makes you spin and go sideways. It is very frustrating. Just a tiny hit and you're off in the gravel on the opposite side of the track.\n\n\nVERDICT :\n\nWhen I was a kid playing F1 1997 on PSOne, I thought that it was the best Formula One game ever made.\n23 years later, I still feel like it was one the best game ever made. We are in 2015 and this game feels like a cheap excuse to release a licenced F1 game. Would be a good arcade game for younger players or people who don't have a deep knowledge of Formula One.\n\nI'm a hardcore fan and I feel like this is a disgrace to our community. I've dreamed of so much better.\nThe game could be so much better, but nobody is dedicated enough to make it.\n\nCodemasters should lose their contract with the FIA and let another passionate studio take over the franchise and rebuild everything from scratch and make a game that actually feel like the real thing.","October 1, 2015","false","105.9"," 102 of 114 people (89%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","89","102","114","7","1"

Where to start with the issues...\n\nHandling: It's impossible. Even for an experienced racer like me, it's utterly impossible. The car randomly vears off the track at sudden intervals that make little to no sense (on power, not on power, sometimes mid corner, sometimes late corner, sometimes on entry) its impossible to predict or correct in many instances without adding more grass to the tyres. I get it, you want it to be realistic, but lets face it, unless you are Pastor Maldonado, this is far from realistic.\nForget setting up controls either, it seems Codemasters decided we didnt need those options... And my wheel just simply refuses to be detected other than as a gamepad (!!!).\n\nThe menus are ridiculous too, its really really hard to navigate. It makes little to no sense and doesnt even match the previous versions of the game, so its like trying to learn something new all over again, it just adds to the sense of frustration while playing it. If that wasn't bad enough, when you start a game, the usual ESC button used in every other menu, doesnt do anything (!!!) instead I had to smash many keys until a menu came up (its P by the way).\n\nThe graphics aren't even very good either, despite running a very high end PC with 16gb of ram and 970 graphics card. It looked worse than last year...\n\nThen there is the season part. Taken away completely and replaced by a single season system where you drive as one of the current drivers. Why can't I use my own damn name and race across many seasons like in previous years games?\n\nIt feels like they've taken away all the flexibility of the old games, replaced the engine with something worse and made the menu system infuriating.\n\nI haven't even mentioned constant frame dips and stuttering during actually trying to stay on the track.\n\nThis should be renamed "ice truck simulator 2015" but then perhaps that title would actually be fun instead of feeling like I've had my testicles squashed in a vice while having vinegar poured in my face (something I'd rather have than play this game in its current state).\n\n","July 12, 2015","false","0.4"," 181 of 226 people (80%) found this review helpful 44 people found this review funny","80","181","226","44","5"

I preordered this game with the information that I read over the internet from reviewers and from the Codies website. I also used my previous experience with Codmasters F1 games as a basis on what type of quality to expect from a game like this one. I have previously purchased Dirt, Dirt 2, Dirt 3, F1 2010 thru 2014 from Steam and for the most part was happy with my purchase. I am also a fan of other racing titles that are more sim than game such as IRacing, Project cars. I have enjoyed playing Race 07, Asetto Corsa except the game server on Asetto Coursa is a joke. I spent many hours in Papyrus titles like GPL and their Nascar series , and also on Geoff Crammonds World Circuit thru his GP4. I have seen both the good and bad of all these titles at their best and worst. I did not set my expectations for F1 2015 any higher than what I had seen them previously release.\n\nCommon sense would dictate that a company that has been making F1 games for the PC since their September release in 2010 would have a good handle on what it takes to get a game ready to market. Common sense need not apply here. It seems with the release of F1 2015 Codmasters has indeed returned to it's roots......console gaming. This title was written with that customer in mind. The control menus are a joke with no punchline. I was never able to get both my CSW V2 wheel and Richmotech real race gear pedals to work at the same time. It is a game that really does not have a target audience and does not know where to fit in. With a shameful lack of content considering what was in previous releases, there is no safety car, interviews, career mode, co-op mode, or classic F1 cars. The sheer scarcity of options and modes means this is yet another year where the "Official F1 tie-in" never even gets to the starting grid. The amount of modes left out of this title is borderline criminal and scandalous. It feels like less than half a game was released at a premium price no less. They "throw in" the 2014 season as a bonus, because it's obvious they intend to BONE US with this title and the absense of so much of what should be seen as standard for F1. This publisher is so hell bent on hitting it's yearly release schedule that it pulled this one out of the oven half baked.\n\nI run a high end system and love to see titles push that hardware for what its worth. My current rig features a core !7-5960, 64 gb ddr4, (2) Titan X video cards in SLI, 2 ASUS G-sync 27" monitors at a res of 5890 x 1080 bezel corrected @144 hz. Aparently I would have had better results on a console system with this title. It crashed the first few times I ran a benchmark test so bad I needed to reload my video drivers and recalibrate the monitors as this game had them stuck in limbo after multiple crashes. This game crashes more than Maldonado and Grosjean combined. The graphics looked bad even when I got them to display, but they were constantly blinking and flashing, seemingly fishing for a proper state of display this catastrophy of a game could not deliver. It looked like it was snowing in Singapore and it nearly caused me to have suffer a seizure from the constant screen blinking. Because I never was ablle to get my wheel and pedals working at the same time, even though they worked fine in all their previous titles, I can not comment on the physics. The track textures have a filtery feeling that left me nausiated as well. This game is so awkwardly stylized it's more like a bad cartoon Anime, than a racing title.\n\nI would have to say that afer a few hours of utter frustration spent trying to fix all the problems that run rampant with simple setup of this game, that the quit menu works great and that's about all. Also thats what I suggest, quit buying these half baked mess and let Codemasters know it no excuses as it is not their first rodeo, but could be their last. The best thing to do with this game is delete it permantly from your drive. There are plenty of good titles that offer proper racing that works to deal with this junk. Return it and get a refund while you can.\n\nIn a side note to STEAM, shame on you too. I have been a customer for over 8 years and have never even tried to return a title. I tried multiple times to get a refund on this as I was never able to complete even one lap, but was told that beacause I had more than 2 hours of trying to fix this worthless piece of junk, that they would not refund my money. Instead opting to join their co-conspirator Codmasters in ripping of a loyal customer for short term profit. Shame on you STEAM and Codmasters, I have purchased many of your products and recommended them to my friends, alas my policy is changed on that too. I will NEVER pre purchase a title again with this return policy. I had always believed that STEAM treated their customers fairly and with respect, but I see this was yet another lesson learned from this terible gaming experience.\n\nYour money would be much better spent on the 2012 or 2013 Codemasters F1 games than this abortion of a game. I would recommend Project Cars or IRacing to anyone looking for a Racing Sim.\nHad either of those titles offered all the cars or tracks from the current F1 season I would have never bothered with this lackluster castrophy in the first place. Save your money and buy something else.","July 13, 2015","false","2.1"," 117 of 144 people (81%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","81","117","144","5","2"

But they haven't. They've taken a step back.\nThere are constant crashes. There's still no parade lap. There's no more safety cars. Worse yet - there's no career mode for drivers who wish to live the F1 dream.\nThey've recommended a GTX 970 as a GPU - which I have, yet the game looks smudgy at best. Sure it runs fluidly in 60 FPS, but cut scenes and replays are at 30 FPS.\nThe bugs like missing championship points in the full season after the game crashes is pathetic. I had a 40 point lead in the championship after the game crashes, and started Round 10 with all the drivers on 0 points.\nBut the MOST irritating thing - you can't do 25% races with full practice sessions or full qualifying. I have 300+ games to play on Steam, I don't have time to do a full race. Let me race at 25% and enjoy your game, and let me do 3 quali runs like I used to do. Is that too much to ask?

The amount of features has been scaled back too much. The graphics engine is an improvement in some ways, but is also a bit more blury. There are also quite a few graphical glitches/flickering (like grass) in spots. The AA settings are a real bummer (no more magnitude setting). None of the new console voice command features are available on the PC/Steam version. Force feedback was supposed to be improved, but it's not any better (if not worse) than 2014.\n\nBut the worst is the huge amount of bugs. The game is relatively unstable. I get in-game crashing periodically, and it will ALWAYS crash when I exit.\n\nI really wanted to like this game. But it's a real disappointment. I'd return it if I didn't buy on GMG. My mistake.\n\nEDIT: To be fair, I should list some pros over the last version (2014):\n-The new MP options are definitely a step in the right direction, especially classifying by difficulty.\n-The new "rival" appearance in Time Trial is awesome.\n-Graphically it's a step sideways: It's less sharp, but overall it's prettier.\n\nThings could get a lot better with some serious patches. However, the past F1 games have had glaring bugs through their entire life, so I'll be surprised if F1 2015 is fixed-up like it should be.\n\nEDIT 2: Wait... No Track IR support? Are you kidding me? This has been a basic feature of the series for at least 4 years.\n\nStay away from this game.

You cannot adjust most primitive control settings - button remaping for predefined controllers;\ndeadzones, sensitivity, saturation etc for custom controllers. Hell there IS NO SUPPORT for custom controllers AT ALL!!!\nThe game does not have any settings unless you have Logitech G27, 29 or equivalent.\n\nIt's unplayable even with X360 controllers, because wheel just don't turn in, you cannot adjust sensitivity and car will get stuck in most narrow corners, scraping walls. Monaco is unplayable without high-end gaming wheels. ♥♥♥♥ing literally!\n\n-- Still on controls, they become unresponsive on random occations. Steering just becomes unresponsive, because ♥♥♥♥ you that why!\n\n-- AI ignores player and rules. Blue flags are for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! AI will not let you pass, and even fight you for position.\nAI loves to ram player and everything else on the track. They will push you into walls and off the track. Multiplayer seems more civil.\n\n-- speaking of multiplayer - it does not work! At all! You might get into one game every hour. There are no proper custom game lobbies, just quick jump in games. Net code is all over the damn place. Players do not sync at all. Everybody blinking all over the road, running into invisible walls and cars, changing positions etc. And you get kicked out of lobbies 9/10 times.\n\n--penalty system works in random mode. It will penalize you when you don't do anything illigal, or when AI is actually to blame. AI will bump into you, and you will recieve warnings and penalties for that. Other times it will not register anything. Even when you cut entire corners.\n\n--The new Pro mode is just regular championship mode on hard. Laziest  and most useless game mode I've ever seen.\n\n--There is no career mode anymore. No more signing teams or anything. Just get into a car and drive - season, single race or time trial. that's it. Multiplayer does not even count, because it does not work.\n\n--it does not look all that good for a new engine. Hey, have you seen Project Cars? People are in the deepest hole in uncanny valley. FPS drops for no reason.\n\n-- I haven't seen more unfinished game in a very long time. And 3 weeks after release, almost nothing has been fixed. fun times!  Just read the community hub!\n\nThis should not be released for another year or two. This is not a finished product! Not even close. Not even "beta" finished. Not even "early access" finished!\n\nCome back after a year... oh wait, then there will be F1 2016 game?!\n\nEdit: Over a month since the release. Still nothing has been fixed. Now multiplayer does not work at all anymore.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcmetroracing/recommended/286570/","mcmetroracing","MetroRacer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcmetroracing/","111 products in account","So the time has come. After extensive gameplay, I can finally get my conclusions on this game. Yep, it's a thumbs up review against 60% negative reviews... ouch.\n\nOkay, let's go. The first point of disappointment around the community is the lack of content that Codemasters had been announcing since October last year. They basically said that physics and handling were taken to a new level of realism, graphics were made realistic and detailed thanks to an all new engine, the player would be more involved in the action thanks the larger variety of cutscenes, a new team radio system with which you can actually interact with the engineer, 2014 season for free, more online modes, two brand new full championship modes, car technical updates as they come in real life... Promising, isn't it? If we look into the game and play it, the guys at Codemasters haven't said a lie. Well, just one: They haven't laid any car update since the day-1 patch, which included team Manor and McLaren's new livery  (what about the new Mercedes rear wing, Force India nosecone, McLaren new short nosecone, Ferrari new sidepods...?). With that exception, everything they said is in the actual game.\n- Handling, physics and tyre model is just amazing. Seriously, it really is. F1 games are no longer a lazily built arcade with random curb spin and nonexistent grip feel on turns and braking points, but and incredibly detailed simulator-like which transmits the power of the cars in all its glory. Now you have torque wheelspin which you can correct with quick steering movements to put the car straight and make it find grip, which makes the car nervous as in real life.\n- Some people moan about the inability to change dead zone and saturation setups on wheels and pads. I have mixed opinions about that: For compatible devices like the Xbox 360/One pad or the main wheels on the market like Logiteg G27/29 or certain Thrustmaster devices the developer has brought a preset setup which adapts to what they want the game to handle like. Change the settings and you completely ruined the car behaviour. On the other hand, this has a drawback. If you have a wheel which hasn't got a preset, forget about ever trying to use it with this game. It would be nice to set up a comfortable setting for it because Force Feedback will mess around and steering will be completely unrealistic and close to impossible.\n- Most PC users report constant bugs. I haven't found any type of glitch during my gameplay, of any kind. Try checking out your GPU drivers before directly blaming the game. Some Youtubers and users make "bug compilation" videos and screenshots of gross bugs with the initial version of the game, without the Day-1 patch. That's not fair, and don't take them into account. If you really want to get feedback about glitches, ask people, document yourself with patch fixes and the PC those users have and their drivers version. Again, I haven't found any bug in like 40 hours of gameplay.\n- Setups are much deeper and they change realistically the behaviour of the car, mostly because the physics take into account many more real-time factors like, say, a fully working weight balance system. Now it comes with five setup presets which you can choose to adapt the car to the circuit you are at plus you can save your own. Tyre model is now enhanced and integrates a much more complex tyre wear system, so choosing the right setup makes a huge difference in tyre management.\n- As to graphics, what they made was basically go back to the F1 2010 model which consisted in using light effects to make beautiful and realistic scenes, but of course they've enhanced textures, added some nice motion blur, a long awaited ambient occlusion and refined colours. Rain effects are also enhanced and rather impressive, and night circuits have a much more accurate reflections and lighting effect.\n- Sounds make a big difference and are probably one of the fields that have been worked out the most. The engine has an impressive range of sounds, from the dynamic roar of the V6 along the revs panorama to the subtle whistle of the turbo, including the electric engines' distinctive sound. Aero sounds are more detailed and go further from the strange noise that sometimes appeared on the previous games when attempting to make it. There's the reverb of the sound when getting close to walls and barriers and more detailed tyre squeak, among other cool effects. Team radio is at its best, providing useful information and with a larger variety of sentences.\n\nNow let's move to the drawbacks, because it doesn't matter how much you're enjoying this game, they're there as a wound. Where to begin... Oh, yeah. The optimization.\nUnlike the rest of the games by Codemasters, F1 2015 is really, really, really badly optimised (I mean, really). Seriously, I don't know what they did there. Frame rate will be the same on the lowest settings as on the Highest, and some tracks have some nasty drops at some points. Pit Stops are somehow capped to some ridiculous 15 FPS and after leaving the pit lane you're back at the normal frame rate. Thank God you haven't got to do anything during pit stops, because otherwise it would have been impossible. Some patches have improved performance and frame rate is more stable now. Game is fully playable though, so no need to panic. I'd take the excuse that this is their first title under the all-new-bright-and-shiny graphics engine so they haven't had enough time to make it as perfect as the previous EGO engine was by the last games it powered...\n- Online. Man, this is by far the worst part of the game. Well, you can't even say it is a part of the game, because it's just broken. As if it wasn't there. No online. One of the additions to this game is, as said before, a new bunch of online game modes, "hoppers" as they call them. These are simply preset lobbies, so you can enter any type of race you want. Looks good, huh? Nope. It doesn't make it easier to find the exact race setting you want, although not because of the game, but the very few people that switches to online. Enter a hopper: No lobbies. Different hopper: No lobbies. Another hopper: Enter a lobby. Lobby already racing ( -.- ).There's also the custom match lobby, of course, but for some reason it cannot be public (only friend invite). Don't want to lose time searching open lobbies and you just want to go online? NOPE! For some reason, they removed the "Joker" of Quick Matchmaking. Manage to enter a lobby and start racing? NOPE! Bound to be kicked from session. To be fair, Codemasters has never had proper servers. 70% of the times in F1 2012 you or anyone else in the lobby would get Disconnected. DiRT 3 was glitchy at some points. But these issues in F1 2015 aren't even normal.\n- The lack of Safety Car, to be honest, doesn't make any difference at all. I have around 200 hours of playtime in F1 2012 and most of the time I play 25%-50% races. Haven't seen a single Safety Car. If so, some red flags. If from 2012 to 2014 the Safety Car was as common as seeing a four-leaved shamrock, why not having it in 2015 is a big deal? My point of view is that the damage system is so bad that there's no reason to lay the Safety Car on track. Massive incident, front wing and wheels off, car and parts disappear, resume racing. With the new graphics engine they could have enhanced the damage system to add debris on track that could cause punctures, gravel spread on the tarmac, marshals picking up pieces... In those occasions it would be easier and reasonable to deploy the Safety Car, but as the damage system only added more realism on flatting tyres against walls and more parts of the front wing that you can lose, there's no reason to do. That's a disappointing drawback, the damage system.\n\nF1 2015 is enjoyable. You'll notice the difference to the previous games from the first moment.\n\n7.5/10","September 3, 2015","true","71.8"," 91 of 122 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","91","122","0","6"

I was able to get some FFB by turning it up in the profiler but it feels completely wrong. It's more like a dull resistance than feedback. Secondly unlike every other racing game this game does not automatically set the correct turning angle which means a lot of messing about in the profiler again to get the in game wheel to match up with my real wheel.\n\nGraphics\nFor a game with such high recommended specs (which my PC meets) the graphics are poor. Nowhere near the level of Project Cars or Assetto Corsa. If a game is recommending a GTX970 it better look amazing. What are they doing with all that processing power? The only conclusion is that this game is very badly optimised. As many people have noted there is a strange blurred look to the graphics too.\n\nSummary\nLooks like another cash-grab from CM. They have a track record of releasing broken games but I really thought the step into next gen (not that I would call this game next gen) would be different. I have requested a refund for the first time ever on Steam. Usually, I would hold out for a patch but again CM have a track record of never really fixing anything in their patches so I don't anticipate that these issues will be solved. Prove me wrong CM and i'll re-buy the game, I really want to be proved wrong.","July 10, 2015","false","8.5"," 69 of 93 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","69","93","0","4"

In fact, without a career mode, you could argue it's a step back. How can DIRT be so good, even in early access, and yet F1 2015 be so bad in its supposedly 'finished' state? Just a terribly lacklustre effort. Does anyone on the Codemasters team have even the slightest interest in F1? Does Codemasters actually want to make a good F1 game, or are they happy churning out the same steaming pile every year?

First off, there is no career mode. Yes, you read that right; NO CAREER MODE! The closest option to it sees you driving the season as one of the current drivers on the grid. Graphics do not appear to have changed much if at all since F1 2013. It looks pretty decent, but there is a strange hazy look over everything and some textures are still quite blurry, particularly the steering wheel. Then you have the most important aspect - the driving/handling. After all the previews I read, I expected the handling and feedback to feel really good, but the reality is shockingly bad. With feedback settings turned all the way up, there is hardly anything there. It is by far the most arcade-like driving feel of the Codemasters F1 games to date. The race optoins seem to be dumbed down as well. It seems you are even limited to 25%, 50%, or 100% race distances, nothing in-between. Then there are issues with controls. After customizing my Logitech MOMO Racing wheel in the settings menu, it worked well enough the first time. After quitting out of the game and relauching, it no longer detects my wheel at all. I even tried removing all game settings files and uninstalling/reinstalling the entire game to no avail.\n\nThis game is a broken shell of its former self that is lacking in nearly every way. It has been stripped of the best game mode. The menu options have been dumbed down even more than they were in F1 2013. I was really looking forward to the revamped, latest iteration of what has been one of my favorite racing series. I have never been so disappointed in a game.","July 9, 2015","false","12.4"," 66 of 92 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","66","92","0","2"

Bad.\n\nI don't have the performance issues some have been having, that said on two GTX980's I expected more than 80fps (I am trying to play at 144, excuse my first world problem) for a game engine that looks exactly the same as each previous installment (with a layer of vaseline over the top). I also challenge the claim they've overhauled the physics engine, it doesn't feel any different than even F1 2012. I had high hopes for the handling model given how well they're doing with Dirt Rally. Boy was my hope misplaced.\n\nHowever there are a couple of glaring issues besides the general "meh" ness of the above. The quality of the tracks has decreased dramatically. They just feel subpar, like they spent all their budget on marketing and FOM licenses instead of getting a team out to the tracks to actually make them accurate. As an example the first bend at Suzuka is flat. FLAT. I'm all for non-laser scanned tracks, but only as long as they actually put in some effort.\n\nThe other is the utter madness that is controller support. The wheel works fine, at least as far as it recognises basic inputs, but the game will not under any circumstance recognise my Fanatec Clubsport pedals connected to my GT2 wheel or to the PC via usb. Absolute garbage. I mean this is real basic race sim stuff right here, and they got it right for ALL their games in the last 3-4 years, and now somehow they stuff it up?

I was determined not to let the reviews of others sway my opinion when buying the game but I'm afraid many of my complaints are widely shared by others in the community.\n\nPreviously I had played F1 2010 & F1 2011 and had really enjoyed the game despite not having a full race wheel setup instead I was using an accellerometer based wheel (Simraceway SRW-S1) so when I bought myself a Logitech G29 I was eager to race in this pc series. Unfortunately F1 2011 did not work properly on Windows 10 so I bought F1 2015 on sale and was considerably unimpressed.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was the graphics were not all they were hyped up to be. The next and IMO the most important thing I noticed was the FFB. Coming from Hundreds of Hours of Project Cars, I was crushingly dissapointed by the FFB. After tinkering with the settings to try and find the optimum setting for my wheel I soon realised it was the way the game sent the FFB signals that was the problem. Basically all you can feel is oversteer and bumps; both are very crude and imprecise and the result is a car that feels like it is floating along and easy to steer through High G turns and feels like a tank when going over bumps.\n\nGetting the FFB right like when you find the sweet spot in pCars can allow you to feel your way through a track but unfortunately the game will leave you numb to any sligt movement in the car.\n\nI know people have been praising the physics; and whilst I have not tried out the previous games I feel like the physics were another thing that was over-hyped. The breaking doesn't respond with enough sensitivity and despite being a bad driver in 12 hours I have not spun out on a kerb or the white line where as in F1 2011 it was a regular occurence.\n\nIn terms of the UI I have no complaints and because of the FFB being so crippling I don't really think the game has the playability to warrant any complaints from me about the lack of game modes and the like so I won't touch on it.\n\nEven on sale I feel let down and havin gplayed some of the Grid games as well I feel that Codies have definitely lowered their standards and have cemented themselves as the lazy, greedy company that will spit out an unfinished game quickly which get progressively worse as time passes.","May 1","false","20.6"," 31 of 36 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","31","36","2","2"

Nothing to great to mention IMHO. It's still way off other titles regarding racing simulations.\n\n- Gameplay:\nNo coop, no career. Menu got better.\n\n- Sound:\nNothing worth mentioning either. Cars sound okay, good thing is that you can hear tyre squeal.\n\n- Physics\nThe car behaves good in general. Reactions are fast and accurate, BUT why, Codemasters, can't you ever manage a decent Force Feedback?! I mean seriously, they've been working on F1 titles for the last 6 years and I have never been pleased with the FFB (only skipped F1 2014 so far)! It's weak and simply not accurate at all. Take racing simulations from other devs as an example and start getting to work, it's simply embarrassing!\nWheelspin is pretty aggressive, which is good, but I can't really control it, which is caused by my bad pedals, too, I'm afraid. But you can compromise a little with setup and wheel settings.\n\n- Setup:\nI could never trust Codemasters' setups in F1 titles and the same goers for F1 2015. The settings just don't influence the handling in the way they should. You simply can't create an individual setup for your personal driving style, which has been a problem since the series started in 2010.\nIn addition to that, you can't change the braking balance in the setup and the description of weigth distribution says, that if you change it to the front you assist understeer. Codemasters, that is simply NOT TRUE, since it supports OVERSTEER if there is less weigth on the rear! This is almost as ludicrous as the settings for rear anti-roll bars in your past titles, where stiffening them caused better traction!\n\n- AI:\nAI got pretty aggressive, which is good. But the bad thing is that it got pretty "derby". It's alright if AI drivers do mistakes, but I won't accept an AI which spins me off track while driving straight, especially if I voluntarily let the drivers past.\n\n- Car damage:\nTouching the wall "not-so-gently" while driving straight with 250+ km/h and having neither front wing damage nor suspension damage...Need I say more? Here you go: Touching the rear of an AI-Car while breaking, no damage to my car. Ridiculous.\n\n- Bugs:\nBreaks are broken, according to status screen, as soon as I exit the pits.\nTyres get cold immediately after releasing the throttle. That's way too fast!\nAgain just ONE training session. But, according to rumours, BEFORE the day one patch there have been three...Seems that codemasters cancelled them afterwards.\nCrashes when performing an ingame Benchmark-test and when exiting the game.\n\nSorry, Codies, but you won't get any more money from me.

And if F1 is your thing, "happy days".\n\nSo what is the issues with the game?\nWell there are many.\n1) No single player campaign, you only play a season as a one of the current drivers\n2) The multiplayer has many missing features\nA) No safety car\nB) No Full Qualifying (But is part of single player, so why not Multiplayer?)\nC) You can't rejoin a session\nD) You can't restart a race without, redoing everything again.\nE) Coming out of the PIT, the game will control your car - great. Whats not great is it doesn't inform you when you get control. Often just as you hit the first corner, making it a ♥♥♥♥ show.\nF) Odd lags, that happens add random. Played a match with a friend, first race he had ton of lag - restarted the race and suddenly it was me getting. Where it freezes your car, so everybody else passes you.\netc.\n3) Penalty system that is, to me, so faulty its game breaking.\nA) Getting penalty - without prior warnings.\nB) Getting penalties for AI ramming you from behind. Which happen often\nC) Getting warnings for corner cutting while driving on a straight line\nD) Inconsistency: 2 Corner cutting warnings on 15 laps = 5secs penalty. Friend gets 9-10 warnings on 8 laps = 3 secs penalty\netc.\n\nAND THE BIG ONE!\n4) AI, stupid god damn horrifying turd of an AI. The majority of the time they have no clue where you are or that you exist. They will ram you for no reason, even when they have ton of space to pass. Monaco is a prime example of this and the penalty system that is so unjust that its on a "delete this ♥♥♥♥ now!" kind of level.\nThe AI is the main reason why I hate this game, why I recommend no one buy this game. The AI is the soul reason why F1 2015 is one of the worst racing games I have played. It destroys every single drop of fun this game has to offer. When racing large tracks it becomes a bit lets - but a track like Monaco becomes unplayable for me.\nIn short: The AI feels like its take from a Destruction Derby game.\n\nSo no I don't like this game, I don't recommend it, I don't want anybody to be filled with so much rage as me from playing against Codemasters excuse of an AI.\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Rage review:\nI hate this game, so much.

Even a few fps is enough to ruin the experience. Turn the settings down I hear you say. The problem is the frame rate drops occurred whether I was running in 3440 x 1440 Ultrawide or 1080p. Exactly the same drops at the same points of the track and even when I set everything to low. It does not hold a steady 60fps in the game. The benchmark works fine, it's even the same track.

It just doesn't feel smooth even when it is running at 60fps, again that's with and without SLi on.\n\nEDIT : Well the FPS drops have gone now, for some odd reason the game has started to run smoothly in that sense. But the backgrounds still pass by like they are on a flick book, especially Albert Park. It's the trees that seem to have a weird shadow issue that makes the game look jerky.

I haven't experienced the optimization issues some have, I'm running it at 1080p, every setting maxed and getting around 110-120 FPS (SLI 980's.) The game does look better than previous years, but is worse in just about every other way it can be.\n\nWith this game, Codies have removed the career mode. This was already known before release, but is still a huge disappointment, as the championship mode to replace it is extremely lacking. The physics and damage are absolutely abyssmal. It drives worse than any other F1 game I've ever played. I noticed how bad the damage was (This is with it on full, too.) so I drove into a wall at full speed in Australia. My front wing broke off, and the rest of the car was fine. Absolutely ridiculous. The cars handle like boats and are terrible to drive.\n\nI use a Thrustmaster T500RS wheel. In all previous games, I've set force feedback to around 50% and it has been perfect,  I could get a good amount of feedback through the wheel and it felt very realistic. Now, with the new game, I have everything in 100% and I can barely feel anything. There's a slight vibration and nothing more with everything maxed out. The car drives like a donkey and when force feedback is essentially non-existant, welp, it becomes almost impossible to drive.\n\nNow, let's get into the fun (not really) that is online. Online is completely broken right now. I joined a lobby for a standard sprint race earlier. 5 of us in the lobbies, no races yet. Apparently I had already got 25 points whilst everyone else was at 0 (As I should have been, since there were no races completed yet.) Then I got into the race. Every car that was around me disappeared upon race start. I thought I was alone on the track, nobody showed on the track or the map, and I appeared to be all alone. Then at the end of lap 2, the fastest lap time shows, and it's the driver who started behind me. Yep. I finish the race and apparently on this empty track the other guy finished ahead of me by just over 1 second and won the race, giving me 2nd and 18 points, however, since I already started with 25 points out of nowhere, I was winning the championship by 18 points still. Oh, and I forgot to mention, from start to end of that race, my car was semi-transparent and flickering constantly, which was annoying and very distracting.\n\nF1 has had some releases that weren't that great (Looking at you, 2014), but none that weren't enjoyable (even if it did take mods to make them as fun as they should be.), every game so far I've found to be worth what I paid for it. Every game except for this one. As a long time F1 fan and fan of racing games, I hate to have to say that this is the last time I ever buy an F1 game so long as Codemasters owns the licence for F1 games. They have completely butchered it in every way imaginable and more. Codemasters, I doubt you'll read this, but I hope you do, just so you know how much you've destroyed what was my favourite racing game series.\n\nI do not reccomend this game to anyone, and I advise you not to buy it, as you will be far better off playing literally any earlier F1 game.","July 10, 2015","false","6.0"," 29 of 36 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","29","36","0","1"

Unfortunately, my hopes have been dashed for the 2nd year in a row. F1 2014 was a complete disaster and now F1 2015 ranks up there amongst the worst. (Not that F1 2010/11/12/13 were without glitches)\n\nFirstly, the positives:\n\n2014 season is included. This is good, CM have included the full '14 season with all the teams and tracks. It's a nice addition that does add some depth to the game.\nThe new handling model is less forgiving than F1 2014 and certainly better than F1 2013. (Using a wheel at least) I can't speak about the FFB because my wheel doesn't have any, but the handling is exciting, the car slides out from under you under braking and it is difficult to accelerate out of low speed corners. On the other hand, there is a real sense of grip at high speed corners.\nThe car models themselves look very good, with all the steering wheels this time round.\nAlthough I haven't tested it fully, the AI seems to be quicker and more aggressive offline.\nUnfortunately, these improvements are offset by a myriad of problems. Here are the negatives:\n\nGraphics are overall quite poor, aside from the cars, everything is permeated by a strange blur. CM's awful filter returns\nWheel support is poor. I have had a lot of problems with keys randomly rebinding - to such an extent that I have to use my keyboard to navigate the menus\nVoice command support is confusing - I'm still not sure if I am able to use it.\nOnline is broken. Ghost cars are back - proper, competitive online racing is impossible at the moment because people's cars do not synchronise properly. I might be racing through Becketts, but on someone elses screen I'll be 20 seconds further back.\nAI is slower online it seems.\nGlitches when exiting the pits, the car will randomly shift into 2nd gear even with pit assist off.\nCorner cutting is AGAIN an issue. It's so lenient that anyone could shave seconds off their lap times by cutting corners without ♥♥♥♥♥ing penalised. This really is disgraceful considering it is CM's 6th attempt at an F1 game.\nNo co-op or career mode. Also no custom helmets online. Audio is boring and flat too.\nThere's other glitches too, but there are too many for me to remember off the top of my head.\n\nOverall, this is a truly dismal effort by CM. After so many years Codemasters are still failing at the basics which is truly awful for a company that has spent years churning out F1 games. Something must be fundamentally wrong in the development process for this game to have got cleared through quality control. A very basic testing of online functionality would have revealed that this game was not fit for release.\n\nIf you just want a very casual playthrough with the latest cars and circuits then this is the game for you. If you want a more in depth experience then steer clear of this wreckage.\n\nIf this CM was an F1 driver it would be Pastor Maldonado: Somehow still involved with the sport despite constantly disappointing us all time and time again.","July 10, 2015","false","14.4"," 27 of 33 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","27","33","0","0"

AI is fun to drive against (although too aggresive at times)\n\nCon's:\n- Bugs. A lot of them. I feel like being a beta tester, but then I'm not paid or am aware of the game being in beta state. Surely every game has its glitches post-release, but there's a difference between nuisances or game breakers. Gamebreakers are being patched alright, but they shouldn't have existed in such amounts. One or two can happen, five is way too much\n- Online still hasn't been fixed, 3 weeks after release. One should think racing games such as these have a large multiplayer community...Can't find lobbies, especially the hardcore hopper. And whose idea was it to remove the custom lobbies?\n- Omitting the career and coop mode. Does this have something to do with the ever-present profile corruption bug? Instead of fixing it, removing it?. Coop was a lot of fun, even with total strangers. It's hidden in the online mode (manually lobby with a friend, then pick the races), but the option has gone from the menu.\n- Did I mention a lot of bugs?\n\nF1 2013, my previous, was a lot better than this game; the only positive I can find is that the cars are handling better, Codemasters should make F1 2016 (2017?) a better game, if not I suspect the Codemasters series will lose its fanbase, and rightly so. I hope they'll be like Williams (2013-2014): after a suckass game, make a great one.\n\n\n","August 1, 2015","false","69.2"," 34 of 46 people (74%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","74","34","46","5","0"

Then the default mapping works as intended, and you can enjoy the much-improved handling. Given the number of other issues that people are experiencing I'd still hold fast for a while if you're not willing to risk it, but the game itself is really enjoyable when it all works fine)\n\nWell, the launch of F1 2015 has been somewhat disasterous. Every platform has had major bugs, none more than PC. Issues with controls, instability, FPS drops, derpy AI...\n\nThankfully, a couple of patches have already released, which fixed some of the crashes and problems with gamepads. The gamepad issue is game-breaking for me - the default controller mapping leaves the brakes locked on, and remapping them leaves no deadzone, making the car difficult to control.\n\nThe game shows a lot of promise - the AI are far more aggressive than earlier games, and the graphics are pretty.

Dirt Rally, Project CARS, Assetto Corsa... if you're waiting for me to mention F1 2015... well, it's not going to happen. Gameplay in F1 is decent, it's a good balance of simulation and casual racing and I loved the game when I was testing it by driving some time trials on good old tracks. However, when I started my first season, won my first pole and started a race, game kicked me in a head, then hit me one more time when I was on the floor. AI is absolutely terrible! It's like I'm playing Carmaggedon. I played not more than 5 single player races and 5 times ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI spined me like police when chasing the bad guys or just hit me from behind. When I'm overtaking AI, they are like my ex-girlfrend - they just can't let go. Okay, I still got multiplayer and this should be a lot of fun. Oh, wait, there are 3 sessions online!

I mean how more could you ♥♥♥♥ this up? I think I can't be more dissapointed since my expectations are so low. How on earth can you give your customers a product such as F1 2015? And I am not even mentioning the bugs that come with the game (which luckily did not occure in my game)!\n\nSince I started with a negatively very bad introduction I'll try to talk about the pros. First of all the number one thing I was desprately waiting for was the inprovment of the AI cars. This year i could finally say the AI cars are a challenge and gives the game a tromendous amount of depth which makes the races attractive in so many levels compared to the previous F1 games from Codies, but it took them 5 years to improve such a basic gameplay tool that should be a priority in every racing game! And ladies and gentlemen that's about it when it comes to gameplay improvment.\nThere is also an improvment in the graphics and it's nice to see a visual difference between F1 2015 and previous F1 games. I could insist it looks next gen, but it isn't mind blowing.\n\nNow the cons: It seemed to me that the developers were mostly interested in the graphic upgrade such as better looking environments, drivers faces and the engineers ,which is completely pointless since all of the character models are acting the same just like in other pre-race start. It definitely does not make my Formula 1 experience more authentic regardlessly on how much the graphics are in depth of detail. If I get to see the same ♥♥♥♥ over and over again it just gets annoying (same thing about the Crofty's commentary). I'd rather just have a simple menu were I could use my imagination instead of forcing my self to enjoy something I'm used to see a lot of amount of times. Some drivers do look pretty neat and some do look literally disgusting like for example Maldonado's face is so ugly that I feel sorry for the driver.\nThe worst thing about this game is the missing content. At first I was amazed by racing for the first couple of laps, but after trying to play a different single player mode instead of just playing quick race, champions mode or time trail I started to realize there is nothing really else to do in this game, but wait you say there is multiplayer? Well i say multiplayer is pure ♥♥♥♥. I spent a week playing this game and I could not even once find a multiplayer session. Codemasters won't let you even create an open lobby session, You can only play with your freinds, but if you wanna race with the rest of the world you can use their "innovative" multiplayer modes which don't have a single player in it!\nAnd the last thing I would like to mention is one of the important aspect of the game that has a big part on how the game runs is the LACK OF SAFETY CAR. I have simply no words for not including such an important game feature that was in the previous games. You say it will be patched sooner or later? That makes it look like that the game is still in early access alpha god damn it!\n\nWhen it comes to gameplay features this game is definetly fun, but this innovative feature of the game cannot save it from the overall lack of content. In the end this is just an average game and there is nothing really special about it. I'd give this game 3/5  if the multiplayer would work well  and if they wouldn't take out some of the important gameplay features such as a red flag or the safety car.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: 2/5\n\nOh and I spent about 50 hours playing this game on my other steam account.","February 18","false","0.2"," 27 of 35 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","27","35","0","0"

I preordered this game with the information that I read over the internet from reviewers and from the Codies website. I also used my previous experience with Codmasters F1 games as a basis on what type of quality to expect from a game like this one. I have previously purchased Dirt, Dirt 2, Dirt 3, F1 2010 thru 2014 from Steam and for the most part was happy with my purchase. I am also a fan of other racing titles that are more sim than game such as IRacing, Project cars. I have enjoyed playing Race 07, Asetto Corsa except the game server on Asetto Coursa is a joke. I spent many hours in Papyrus titles like GPL and their Nascar series , and also on Geoff Crammonds World Circuit thru his GP4. I have seen both the good and bad of all these titles at their best and worst. I did not set my expectations for F1 2015 any higher than what I had seen them previously release.\n\nCommon sense would dictate that a company that has been making F1 games for the PC since their September release in 2010 would have a good handle on what it takes to get a game ready to market. Common sense need not apply here. It seems with the release of F1 2015 Codmasters has indeed returned to it's roots......console gaming. This title was written with that customer in mind, once again letting the PC customer know their business was unimportant to Codemasters.The control menus are a bad joke with the PC customer being the punchline. I was never able to get both my CSW V2 wheel and Richmotech real race gear pedals to work at the same time. It is a game that really does not have a target audience and does not know where to fit in. It is neither a Sim for hardcore enthuiasts or an arcade game strictly for fun. It lacks the features needed to entice the player into the simulated world of F1 Racing. This game is like a bad coat of paint aimed squarely at oblivion and doesn't really cover up all the problems underneath. With a shameful lack of content considering what was in previous releases, there is No fuunctional safety car, No  TV interviews, No career mode, No co-op mode, No Classic F1 cars,  No season challenge, No rival system, No champions mode, No SLI support, No split screen, No motorhome. No paddock and No TV interviews. The sheer scarcity of options and modes means this is yet another year where the "Official F1 tie-in" never even gets to the starting grid. The amount of modes left out of this title is borderline criminal and scandalous. It feels like less than half a game was released at a premium price no less. This title is far inferior to 2014, which was in turn inferior to the 2013 release. I don't believe most buyers will believe this is a "less is more" situation, but rather a trend to charge more and give less. They "throw in" the 2014 season as a bonus, because it's obvious they intend to BONE US with this title and the absense of so much of what should be seen as standard for F1. Codemasters really should kiss you before you buy this game, since it seems their intent is to just screw you, perhaps you would feel less used after. This publisher is so hell bent on hitting it's yearly release schedule that it pulled this one out of the oven half baked, and a easy bake oven they got a at a garage sale at that.\n\nI run a high end system and love to see titles push that hardware for what its worth. My current rig features  a core !7-5960, 64 gb ddr4, (2) Titan X video cards in SLI, 2 ASUS G-sync 27" monitors at a res of  5890 x 1080 bezel corrected @144 hz. Aparently I would have had better results on a console system with this title. It crashed the first few times I ran a benchmark test so bad I needed to reload my video drivers and recalibrate the monitors as this game had them stuck in limbo after multiple crashes. This game crashes more than Maldonado and Grosjean combined. The graphics looked bad even when I got them to display, but they were constantly blinking and flashing, seemingly fishing for a proper state of display this catastrophy of a game could not deliver. It looked like it was snowing in Singapore and it nearly caused me to have suffer a seizure from the constant screen blinking. Because I never was ablle to get my wheel and pedals working at the same time, even though they worked fine in all their previous titles, I can not comment on the physics. The track textures have a filtery feeling that left me nausiated as well. This game is so awkwardly stylized it's more like a bad cartoon Anime, than a racing title.\n\nI would have to say that after a few hours of utter frustration spent trying to fix all the problems that run rampant with simple setup of this game, that the quit menu works great and that's about all. But even that suffers from problems as Steam then tries desperately to download some sort of non-existent update and finishes on an error 41. I suggest we all quit buying these type of half baked mess and let Codemasters know it no excuses as it is not their first rodeo, but could be their last. The best thing to do with this game is delete it permantly from your drive. There are plenty of good titles that offer proper racing that works to deal with this junk. Return it and get a refund while you can. Don't let them pull the wool over your eyes with idle promises to fix it....baaaahhhh bahhhhh.\n\nIn a side note to STEAM, shame on you too. I have been a customer for over 8 years and have never even tried to return a title. I tried multiple times to get a refund on this as I was never able to complete even one lap, but was told that beacause I had more than 2 hours of trying to fix this worthless piece of junk, that they would not refund my money. Instead opting to join their co-conspirator Codmasters in ripping of a loyal customer for short term profit. Shame on you STEAM and Codmasters, I have purchased many of your products and recommended them to my friends, alas my policy is changed on that too. I will NEVER pre purchase a title again with this return policy. I had always believed that STEAM treated their customers fairly and with respect, but I see this was yet another lesson learned from this terible gaming experience.\n\nYour money would be much better spent on the 2012 or 2013 Codemasters F1 games than this abortion of a game. I would recommend Project Cars or IRacing to anyone looking for a Racing Sim.\nHad either of those titles offered all the cars or tracks from the current F1 season I would have never bothered with this lackluster castrophy in the first place.

As an avid follower of F1 and a racing game enthusiast, I had some hopes in the new physics and their work in FFB...

No feel for grip loss. It vibrates when you are off-track though.\n-Codemasters seem to have trouble mastering steering wheels. Even selecting the correct preset, the rotation of the ingame-wheel and the real wheel are not locked.

But this game does leave me with two main problems. Firstly the use of next gen graphics. Yeah eye candy is the word but at the expense of clarity. This leaves me with so much eye strain because of this constant sense of my eyes being out of focus. I'm left grabbing for a set of glasses I dont have. The use of soft treatment of solid outlines, blurred motion (you cannot turn off) and overall visual sense of lack of visual focus is painful at best. The second issue is that of control. The driving dynamics compared to F1 2014 for me is a step backward. I constantly feel like the car is doing what it pleases in a negative way. You dont get the feeling you are in control most of the time. The lack of setitng deadzones, sensitivity is a loss for me.

However, it's fairly clear to see why there was very little media coverage of the game prior to launch: a huge swathe of features present in the 2010-2014 iterations of the title simply aren't there (no safety car, no brake options in setup, no career mode, etc.) and even some of the promised features don't function yet on PC (voice-activated race engineer, for example).  The omission of career mode doesn't really bother me greatly, though it was a nice feature, but removing the safety car in an F1 season where it's seen a significant amount of action, seems incredibly short-sighted.\n\nAdd to this a game that crashes frequently; fails to remember options set in menus; has AI who drive like you're not even there (ramming you from behind or aggressively swerving into one of your rear tyres, usually resulting in a penalty for you); and displays a horrendous impermeable "blur" past about 200m in front of the car, that makes it almost impossible to see braking points and fine details in the distance... and you have a disappointing product.\n\nMany wondered how the system requirements for the game could be so high, in the face of a comparatively stripped-down F1 experience, and we have our answer: graphical optimisation seems almost non-existant.  The difference between "everything on ultra" and "everything on low/off" on my machine, represents a whopping 5 FPS difference (from ~30 FPS to ~35 FPS)... leaving us to assume there's a serious bottleneck occurring somewhere, that apparently wasn't worth finding before asking customers to hand over their hard-earned £40.\n\nAmongst all of this, however, it has to be said: the handling model has improved significantly in most of the major areas, and you do feel significantly less 'helpless' than in previous F1 titles by Codemasters (which infamously included the mind-bogglingly stupid "auto-spin kerbs").  I've been enjoying the driving experience, until the blur and micro-stuttering gives me a headache and I have to give it a break for an hour or two :)\n\nNot as bad of a screw-up as Arkham Knight, but certainly worthy of being mentioned in the same sentence - a spectacularly poor attempt from Codemasters and, if I hadn't purchased from a third-party, I'd be half way to my Steam refund by now.","July 10, 2015","false","6.3"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","16","21","0","0"

Their F1 series, while generally good (2013 being their best effort, at least for me), has always lacked that little bit of magic to truly set it apart from previous, and quite frankly, better F1 games.\n\nF1 2015 had the opportunity to really set a new standard for the genre, with Codemasters finally taking the hint and using the power of next generation gaming platforms to build a newer, more modern engine.\n\nWhat followed is a product that has ultimately both satisfied and disappointed me for various reasons. Here we go.\n\nPROS\n\n- The handling model. Yes. Finally. I can't believe it. Codies have actually managed to produce cars which drive and feel great. And not in the "easy" sense of things. Turn the aids off, and you will struggle for traction, you will pump the brakes to keep them from locking, and you will need lightning reactions to correct over/understeer and avoid damaging your car and tyres. The feedback provided through the wheel is great, and you almost instantly know you've taken a corner well, even with your eyes shut. It truly is satisfying when you really nail a corner, let alone a whole lap.\n\n- The Presentation. One thing Codies Racing fans have been asking for since 2010 is a more TV-styled game, and this year they finally deliver. The often talked about Broadcast Presentation before and after races is great, with TV style camera angles and OSDs that come close to the FOM world feed. The commentary is awesome too, with lots and lots of varied lines, you don't really hear much of the same thing, and it just gels. It doesn't sound robotic and mis-matched like previous attempts at putting commentary in an F1 game. (I'm looking at YOU, Championship Edition.)\n\nAnd that's about it, I'm afraid. All that I really enjoy about this game. Those two points. I'm serious. Really.\n\nHere's a quick mish-mash of all the cons then:\n\nCONS\n\n- Codemasters giveth, and they doth taketh away. Want to race as yourself? Too bad. It's gone. Want to race with equal setups in Time Attack to truly find who is the best? Shame, that's gone too. Safety Car? Gone. Season Challenge? Gone. Scenario Mode...you get the idea.\n\n- The game doesn't seem to save my preferences and I find myself having to redo custom controls every I boot up.\n\n- Online Multiplayer. No. Just no.\n\n- Then there's the numerous bugs and glitches truly representative of an unfinished game. Just type in F1 2015 glitches/bugs in Youtube and you'll pretty much get what I mean.\n\n- Codies' amazing idea to pad out the game with 2014 content and hope no-one notices.\n\nIt's a shame that, while Codemasters finally got something amazingly right in F1 2015, there are too many places where they just fall flat on their faces. I really don't know if I can review this as Recommended. I guess if the improved handling model is all you ever wanted, then it's great. Have a blast. However, if you were looking forward to a more comprehensive game with more appeal beyond just a World Championship Season, then just stick with F1 2013, it really is still the best.\n","July 10, 2015","false","30.7"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

Weird bugs, incomprehensible force feedback, stupid online matchmaking and sync problems.  CM touts the "TV Presentation" of the game, but once you've seen it...you want it to go away.  The podium ceremonies are just the same cutscene each time with different skins.  I initially thought it was clever when Seb did "the finger".  When Lewis won the next race and did the exact same thing...my thoughts changed to "how lame".  The highly touted "next-gen" graphics, just make the game look like a muddled, blocky mess with a huge helping of motion blur (blur can only be turned off by editing an XML file).  I will say in 2015's defense though, they do seem to finally have gotten the AI drivers right, but better AI can't save this title.\n\nIf you want an exciting drive...get Dirt Rally instead.

It's not worth it. If you haven't go back and buy 2013 and get the 90s cars and tracks. Good content, fun racing, good driving model, good tracks. This game isn't living up to it's hype. If you do buy this NOT ON PC!\n\nBiggest let down ever. No more career mode. Don't even bother getting this on PC because you cant do races longer than 5 laps. Obviously you can select to but you'll run out of fuel. You can't talk to your engineer on the pc version, only on consoles. You need to talk to him to even know about your tires of your ♥♥♥♥ing fuel.\n\nThe driving model while at first seemed better in the end was far worse. I wouldn't even turn the wheel (all assist off) and it would take me out of a corner from right to left. I was getting oversteer and should have been in the wall but the game actually without any assist corrected it for me. Later on it felt so twitched it just wasn't natural. Not to mention there's a major input delay that can't be turned off.\n\nOn a positive note the AI are much better. They will actually pass you now and try to defend. They allow you to play the 2014 season with 2014 cars and driver lineup. Possitives just kinda end there.\n\nI want to say the tracks are good but I've found the tracks are mapped incorrectly as well. In montreal you just fly past the wall of champions and really don't even turn. How did they ♥♥♥♥ up a track that they had in their previous games?! Honesly...\n\nThere's also no safety car... Yeah and no word on why yet.","July 9, 2015","false","5.6"," 22 of 34 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","22","34","0","0"

They will try to overtake but really love to hit your rear wheels and make you spin off track or into a wall. (Had to do 5 laps with Maldonado and Grosjean on my rear and can't count the amount of times I had to use flashbacks to correct the crashes they made me do)\n- This motion blur effect when pitting is weird as when you turn into your pit station it looks like the game is lagging pretty badly.\n- Championship mode lacks features of customising how you want your race weekend to go. Some people have a lot of time while others don't and just want to get into the race. Speeding up the time is very slow and would be nice to add a feature that can increase the time in steps.\n\nAll in all the game can be good but I wouldn't recommend buying the game till all the problems have been resolved. Also the lack of features in the game the price should be no more than £20. Luckily I got mine for £27.99 on Amazon prime so I did save quite a bit than paying £39.99 but still I feel I paid more than what I should have.","July 10, 2015","false","28.4"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

I've just gotten my copy of  F1 2015 from my game store today. I've downloaded it, launched it, expecting it to be a good one. The menu looks great, navigation not bad. When i went into quick race, start the race, i'm stuck on the grid. I'm using a D-pad to play on PC. When i press on RT, the car just doesn't move. I HAD to manually go to the controls settings to change the controls one-by-one. AND when i press B ( Back ) , it takes it as A ( Selects ). Seems like D-Pad is screwed on this game. In Flashback option, pressing X means flashback. However, i press X, it's just back. AND i HAD to press A ( which is pause ) to flashback. Not sure what's going on here. The throttle and brakes seems screwed as well. Lastly, by moving the left stick, which means turning left or right, i moved it slightly and the steering wheel already shows fully. WOW. Nice one there. Turning at a corner with the joystick moved slightly, turns the car fully. Graphics wise, i have nothing to say about it. Can barely see the rear mirror.

(Yes, with any pov and anyone)\n-I found all of the tracks better, in therm of graphics, if your specs are the one recommended or above then you will not have FPS drops playing at Ultra quality.\n-You can talk to your engineer while racing, it works with a mic, you can ask anything along the race, I did not expect this.\n-AI is more aggressive than previous games, and will try to overtake you in a corner or off the racing line. (Which causes crashes in most of the case, but it's still better than before.)\n\nThat's all I found with the positives, now you'll understand why I rated this game that way.\n\nNegatives:-This game is unplayable with Keyboard , you need to have a Joystick otherwise you will just race off the track at every corner. So I took my Gamepad to try my best.\n-Gameplay changed too much, car handling is not perfect nothing near a real simulation.\n-AI is stupid (even more than previous games) and will drive into you, or will randomly ghost when you try to overtake them.\n-No more Safety car, no more Career Mode (I played only Career mode in their old games and I guess many did the same)\n-Collisions/Car damage is not realistic at all, as always we will need to wait until modders fix this, since CodeMasters will probably not.\n-The game gave me the worst corner cutting experience i've ever had. No jokes, even in F1 2006, 2010, 2013, 2014, it was more realistic when turning into corners. It just feels like the wheel does not turn but the car keeps turning like everything is fine.\n\n\nWell that's all I got to say, now if you're looking for an Arcade game then this is made for you, if you're looking for a true F1 experience (as they advertised) then you will be disappointed as Car handling even with all assists off is too unstable, no career mode and no safety car which is totally unrealistic.\n\nAs they always do, they won't add anything until F1 2016 so they can get our money again just for 2-3 new features. That got me bored. Having new features that are cool but in the meantime they remove things that F*cks up the game.\n\nNext time i'll try it at a friend's house before giving away my money.","July 11, 2015","false","2.2"," 19 of 30 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","19","30","0","2"

As a massive F1 fan I want so badly for these games to be good but they're just getting worse. No career mode is an absolute joke, it's like going back to the F1 97 days of just having a championship mode, except that was a great game. The driving itself feels pretty good and I like the options you have in terms of communicating with the team while driving, but the graphics just look a bit strange to me, like a bit too glossy I think. Also the damage is absolutely awful. I T-boned Ricciardo at a hairpin to test it out and was left without a front wing but zero other damage!!! I was under the impression that F1 2014 was poor so that the team could focus on 2015, and now I read that they weren't happy with the career mode so will probably leave it until 2016, but why should I believe them? So disappointing...","July 10, 2015","false","1.4"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

It's good to have a challenge. However, there are too many other problems with the game that are just too big to ignore. Predominantely:\n\n- Graphics: While they are good, Codies have gone from looks over actual gameplay and functionality.\n- Multiplayer: is absolutely woeful. It's impossible to race against anyone effectively when the game can't keep up with who is where on the track. All of a sudden, you get told you're in first, and before you even cross the line, someone else has crossed it and pops up a fastest lap.\n- Push to Talk: Why was this stripped out of the game? I don't want to voice everyone in the game if I'm speaking to someone privately in a TS Server.\n- Glitches: ie: refer my posted screen shot - how the hell can a car drive around on rims!?!?!? This isn't the only one.\n- Gameplay assists: There's absolutely NO difference between Traction Control being off and on Medium. There was at least some difference on 2014.\n- Steam Achievements and Trading Cards: Despite doing at least 10 clean laps around Russia in a Marrusia in Time Trial, the game fails to recognise these laps towards the achievement - I don't know why. The game also claims to have Steam Trading cards - I'm yet to see any after nearly 4 hours of play, and a friend has 10 times as many hours (40) and hasn't seen any either. So the Trading Cards are a blatant lie at this stage.\n\nCodies - if you bothered to look at the Meta Scores in Steam for your games since 2010, they have been steadilly declining, with 2014 being the worst of the last 5. Your track record suggests that this one will be the worst of the lot. If you can't get your ♥♥♥♥ together, you don't deserve a renewal to make more of these games from FOM.\n\nThere's just one question remaining: Did anyone at Codemasters even bother to test this game PROPERLY before it was released?\n\n\n**EDIT: SInce my review, allegedly, trading cards have been released. **","July 12, 2015","false","56.1"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","13","19","0","0"

In DirectInput mode, the game thinks the X button is the B button, the A button is the B button and so on. It also locks the brakes on as soon as you start a session, so again unplayable.\n\nI tried the pad in the archaic XInput mode, and while the game does seem to recognise it as a gamepad, the R2 and L2 buttons in XInput mode work like switches rather than triggers, so you're throttle and brakes are either 0% on or 100% on, with no middle ground. This also makes the cars completely undriveable, and the game unplayable.\n\nThere's absolutely NO excuse for selling a game with such fundamental playing errors. At the moment, you can't even call it a game, because you can't play it AT ALL. I don't know if CodeMasters have left the PC port 'til the last minute, or don't think that controller support is necessary for their games, or if they were forced to release the game in such a state to satisfy contractual demands with the Formula 1 licensing body, but whatever the reason, they've royally screwed over their fans and their customers.\n\nI cannot reccomend this game to anyone.","July 10, 2015","false","16.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

It's kind of shocking since there is that whole Codemasters-Thrustmaster partnership thing and they support EIGHTEEN other Thrustmaster products. That is litteraly half of the PC enable devices listed on the Codemaster website, so it's not like this is some weird no-name 3rd party controller that no one knows about. Hell, I bought this controller specifically because it was the best rated controller for racing style games and I can't really afford to shell out an extra $300 on a wheel and pedal setup as nice as that would be. Even after going into the settings menu I couldn't even create a custom profile and bind the controller buttons, even though it seemed like the option to do so was there. I can't really discuss the gameplay because I couldn't actually get to play the game at all. I am hugely dissapointed that Codemasters couldn't be bothered to add in suppoort for what is basically a standard 360 gamepad. Oh, the graphics of the cars are ok but everything else (track, stands, etc.) looks like it was assembled out of 2005's leftovers.

I mean how more could you ♥♥♥♥ this up? I think you can't be more dissapointed since your expectations are so low. How on earth can you give your customers a product such as F1 2015? And I am not even mentioning the bugs that come with the game (which luckily did not occure to me)!\n\nSince I started with a negatively very bad introduction I'll try to talk about the pros. First of all the number one thing I was desprately waiting for was the inprovment of the AI cars. This year i could finally say the AI  cars are a challenge and gives the game a tromendous amount of depth which makes the races attractive in so many levels compared to the previous F1 games from Codies, but it took them 5 years to improve such a basic gameplay tool that should be a priority in every racing game! And ladies and gentlemen that's about it when it comes to gameplay improvment.\nThere is also an improvment in the graphics and it's nice to see a visual difference in F1 2015 and previous F1 games. I could insist it looks next gen, but isn't mind blowing.\n\nNow the cons: It seemed to me that the developers were mostly interested in the graphic upgrade like better looking environments, faces and the engineers ,which is completely pointless since all of the character models are acting the same just like in other pre-race start. It definitely does not make my Formula 1 experience more authentic regardlessly on how much the graphics are in depth of detail. If I get to see the same ♥♥♥♥ over and over again it just gets annoying (same thing about the comentary). I'd rather just have a simple menu were I could use my imagination instead of forcing my self to enjoy something  I'm used to see a lot of amount of times. Some drivers do look pretty neat and some do look literally disgusting like for example Maldonado.\nThe worst thing about this game is the missing content. At first I was amazed by it, but after trying to play a different single player mode instead of just playing quick race, champions mode or time trail I started to realize there is nothing really else to do in this game, but wait you say there is multiplayer? Well i say multiplayer is pure ♥♥♥♥. I spent a week playing this game and I could not even once find a multiplayer session. Codemasters won't let you even create an open lobby session, You can only play with your freinds, but if you wanna race with the rest of the world you can use their "innovative" multiplayer modes which don't have a single player in it!\nAnd the last thing I would like to mention is one of the important aspect of the game that has a big part on how the game runs is the LACK OF SAFETY CAR. I have simply no words for not including such an important game feature that was in the previous games. You say it will be patched sooner or later? That makes it look like that the game is still in early access alpha god damn it!\n\nWhen it comes to gameplay features this game is definety fun, but this innovative feature of the game cannot save it from the overall lack of content.\n\n6/10","July 15, 2015","false","67.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

I can understand codes baby, I can, it hurts the pride when moders make your game better then you can, but to go out of the way to make it MOD UNFRIENDLY is just crazy stupid.\n\nFirst things first, audio is trash, I know the new v6 engines don't sound as great as last gen cars, but they don't sound this bad, Its F1 not lawnmower man. Do the f1 teams not let you near their cars codes, why can't you get a proper sound recording of the engines (moders can).\n\nWhy can I not change my viewing angle? ACorsa, Pcars, Iracing, etc all let me, so why then Codes dont you. There is this little something sim racers like to do and thats GETTING A PROPER FOV based on screen size and viewing distance you FU@$ ♥♥♥♥♥. (MODers let me)\n\nSo you got Anthony Davidson, who does a bit of the simulation stuff for Mercedes, as your handling consultant and In terms of detailed feedback, it's Anthony first and foremost. So I've never driven an F1 car, but if this was going to be a SIM like you said over and over should the wheel have high speed vibrations? (yes), snap over or understeer?(yes). I've played the f1 mod for ACorsa and they got them in there. Did you do ANYTHING the real drivers said.\n\nTheir is NOWAY Lewis played this game and liked it (Codes stated he gave it a go on many occasions) I bet he was like "damn its just like driving the real thing, the steering and FFB is so close to real life, Ive always wanted a bathtub racing sim, so when do I play F1" (MODERS have got FFB to feel good). YEA, YEA everyone says FFB is a personal thing, BS there is GOOD force feedback (fools your brain into thinking your driving a car and BAD FFB you can tell your playing a game) This is the latter. There is NOWAY you can sitdown in cockpit view and tell me it feels like your behind the wheel of an F1 car. (Modders in Acorsa have captured that terror and thrill)\n\nWhy is their NO telemetry in this game, not FFB cliping tool, no brake or gas tool? Ohh, because its a sim and you don't need those in a sim. LOL\n\nBack when i was a Child i enjoyed childish things, but as i grew older in sim racing I have learned to leave childish things behind. F1 2015 is to me childish, If you like the game more power to you, i wish i could, man do i wish i could.

(More on that later though.)\nDriving in rain is fairly good looking with offset TVPod. And actually in general.\nThe engineer stuff is pretty immersive, and he will update you aswell with info etc.\nTyre wear seems great so far and you can really feel your grip go, and feel if you are hard on them or not.\nGame seems to run well, and stable maxed out. 4690k / 970.\n\nNegatives.\nStripped features, that were in previous games like :\nNo Scenario mode.\nNo Co-Op season.\nNo career mode.\nFull qualifying but 50% race? nope.\n\nIt feels bareboned at best sadly.\n\nRaindrops on your screen is worse than f1 2014. Very blurry, can barely tell its supposed to be drops.\nLackluster settings, like chromatic abberation and blur having to be manually killed off in the config.\nCome on codemasters, Windows 8 has voice recognition aswell, you COULD have added that feature for PC aswell.\nPro mode is manual gears only, and i feel that isn't really okay. We should still have the option of manual/auto.\nTire models seem almost too clean? Grass to rubber transition is instant instead of wearing off slowly etc.\nMultiplayer not finding any games for me /will be edited out when it does.\nMultiplay lobbies are friends only , right now it seems.\nGame is beautiful, but doesn't look like the next gen stuff from the trailers.\nIf they are going to add Podium cutscenes, at least pull them off right, the funny music is extremely anti climactic, and no champagne spraying etc.\nDrivers hugging /Arm around the shoulders... LOL.\nFFB.\n\nI'm very sad, because i really wanted to give it a good review, but as of right now, it's not going to get one, Next gen game with stripped/missing features, that's not cool codies.

The car handling feels like a big step up from previous games, especially with a wheel: where I could comfortably drive the cars with all the assists off in previous games, I'm struggling to do so here, because the handling is much more (presumably realistically) knife-edge. Just slamming the accelerator or brake won't do you any good, and you need to feel what the car's doing through the wheel.\n\nSo, the driving is pretty good. Unfortunately, the racing is dire, at least in single-player.

What a mix of emotions from this game.\nI'll start from the start, but before I do, Im not going to mention any sort of bugs or anything like that, just the game itself.\nNegatives:\n- I really enjoyed having my own career so not being able to play as myself only as a current racer really really sucks for me and is probably for me the most disappointing thing so far.\n- The second thing that really annoys me is the fact you cant edit the race distance which sucks. There's 3 settings of race distance and you cant edit that at all.\n- I enjoyed the Young Drivers Test in the 2013 game and thought it added a lot to it as a real career. In this game the first time you get to drive in career mode is the first practice session. To live the full experience of F1, there should be young drivers test and pre Season testing to learn to drive the car and even set up tips etc.\n\nI havent played a lot of the game yet but these are just some things I feel.\n\nNow positive:\n- I like the 2014-15 change over, not sure if it does, but I hope you can start the career in 2014 then at the end of the year it goes to 2015.\n- The new look start up menu looks good, and the start of each session with Crofty (As much as I dont like him or his voice) is pretty cool i suppose.\n- The new interactions with the drivers and engineers like the setup with the tablet, the pop up menu in the race, etc and the new setup options aswell.\n\nThis is all I have so far but I will start playing a bit more and see how it goes.","July 17, 2015","false","6.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shnoofeen/recommended/286570/","Shnoofeen","Shnoofeen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shnoofeen/","279 products in account","So I previously had a review for this game which was quite negative. Now some time has passed since the initial realese and some additional hours have been added to the playtime.\n\nSo lets revamp this on how I feel about this game at this state;\n\nA lot of talk was about the game crashing which I previously didn't have any trouble with. However, I had stated that the game loaded very slowly which I can happily say no longer seems to be a case.\n\nI'd spoke a little about the graphics, I still don't truely belive there is any difference graphically compared to the other games. It has improved, there are lower flickers and edges, but there are still some common graphical issues that do occur!\n\nThe game options have now been updated and finally do stick when you've selected them, so no more fiddle faddeling just to set up a game.\n\nThe sound is still fundamentally broken! It's a trait through every game I guess...\n\nThe AI overall is a lot more challanging, though they do really still make very rookie moves and they have a tendancy to get in front of you and just brake and pull you off the track, causing your race to be ruined :/ sigh...\n\nThe controller is still very much broken, a lot of improvements but still it's not where it should be, not even with custom settings. Car is very difficult to steer on steering lock, I could actually go as far as saying keyboard is better for a full lock turn... now that is shocking.\n\nMuliplayer? There practically is none. The hoppers are rubbish and custom matches you'll be lucky to find two or maybe three lobby. Likely when you get into that lobby and start a race, you'll find yourself getting passed by cars because you get ghosted (some weird glitch under braking) or if not that getting thrown into a gravel trap from some freaky alien glitch spinning you several times on the spot then leaping you out into that gravel l o l .. Penalty system.. well, should I say more.. However the timings and connection does seem much more stable, not really a pro though when you consider the other glitches.\n\nOverall it would be an OK game to buy, for £10 or less (if you didn't own any other versions) Though I would probably recommend you to get 2013. Paying anything more though is just asking for dissapointment.\n\nI don't think I can recommend this game still at this time though because I just don't truely believe that it's a finished product. Updates come out rarely and when they do they're not resolving real time issues.\n\nThough that doesn't mean it can't change my mind in the future.\n\nSort your ♥♥♥♥ out Codematers, and finish this damn game!","July 17, 2015","false","102.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

This is my first steam review as I normally don't bother writing them, but I couldn't let this slide .. the game is terrible. I've come across four bugs in under an hour. First, the keyboard doesn't work for navigating the menus so you can't change default controls (I googled and eventually found if you disconnect all of your controllers you can eventually get it to work), then the left rear wheel just constantly flickers. Then for some reason when I pressed the accelerator the wheels animated and eventually started smoking but the car didn't move at all on track (not a traction control problem, another bug). Then the cinematic cut scenes are garbled too. Another possible bug (not included in the four above) is getting errors when the game tries to communicate with the steam servers (something I've never experienced with any other game). I've played the previous games in the series and quite enjoyed them. If you want a decent racing game at the minute I suggest assetto corsa. Codemasters should be embarrassed.

If you've played the others, you know what to expect - fast cars go around a track. It hasn't really changed all that much, even with the new engine.\n\nFor me, it runs decently (i7 4790k@4.5/16GB RAM/SLI 980). Hangs around 80fps, though did drop to 50 at one point. Many people have severe framerate issues though. For what it is, it's not that well optimised if it requires a 970.\n\nWhat really gets me is the lack of TrackIR support. TrackIR is a headtracking tool that allows you to look around by moving your head in real life. In these racing games, it's really quite useful. Dirt Rally has it. The older F1 titles have it. F1 2015? Nope. If you go into proper first person mode with the camera, you lose half of your mirrors. You can use a button to look left or look right, but this removes the front view. With TrackIR I could just move my head slightly, still be able to see out the front and see the entire mirror.\n\nHandling I found was pretty decent, really light on the Force Feedback though, can be changed in the settings at least.\n\nThe AI is not all that great. I'm pretty sure they should avoid crashes whereever possible, but they instead like to just ram me out of the way. Even on the starting grid, I was messing about looking for the look left button and wasn't moving, but a car decided to just drive straight on into me instead. Maybe he should have gone to Specsavers.\n\nThey've fixed some crashes, but I still had a crash in the menu.\n\nSound is poorly mixed. The pit crew is barely audible. From what I can hear, it's some poor voice acting.\n\nAlso, it might interest you to know that the console users can communicate with their pit crew via commands over the microphone. Codemasters decided to leave it out of the PC version.\n\nConclusion: Buy the older titles, this is yet another rubbish port of the console version.","July 10, 2015","false","1.6"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

The AI is something that i was most positive suprised , they are not those that rams you of the road , but they do mistakes to , missing corners if taking to much Risk , Crashing , go of Track geting penalties , also you can see that they fight for a place like you do too , but still staying as an Clean Drivers.\n\nI used an Xbox 360 Gamepad to play it , and only in a fev minutes i already found my perfect setting to be available to play on my ideal line's ( of course without spending much time on car settup ) and was ready to go.\n\nThe only problem had so far with this game is , that F1 2015 is a little to far away from a SIM Feeling , also to me , this is one of the most Arcade F1 Game i played so far.

After a few minutes spent on the track, my first impressions are of mixed-bag...\n\nGood:\n-Massive improvement on engine (PU) sounds compared to F1 2014\n-Significantly better looking than F1 2013.\n-Handling is very good (with a joypad)\n-Podium Cutscenes (but I don't mind about the in-game narrator)\n-Well optimized. Runs at 60fps with a r9 270, i7 4770 on medium/highs after driver update\n-Almost instant flashbacks, and because of the AI's behaviour, it's a relief\n-Can change race settings during loading\n\nBad:\n-No safety car\n-Damage physics are several steps backwards compared to previous installments\n-Can't disable texture blur\n-Penalty system seems more lenient on crashes\n-Split-screen taken away\n-The McLaren Honda engine sounds terrific...\n-Online features are broken. When I hosted one game, there were 10 players, but when I start the race, all players but one just disappeared and the game kicked me to the main menu due to "not enough players". Also when I join a lobby, I'm always kicked from the start. Bring back open lobbies, and fix this please !\n-AI is aggressive on Medium and Hard setting, they pushed me several times out of the track.\nWhen they get ahead thanks to DRS and/or a superior power unit, the AI just changes its trajectory and brakes hard, preventing the player to overtake back and get the nose stuck to their rear-end instead...Can't imagine Pro Mode without flashbacks then (or with a non-Mercedes powered car ).\n\nMediocre\n-...but still sounding dull , especially on downshifts and in the pit lane\n-lack of personality. I personally appreciate the scrapping of the tutorial mode on single player and the email messaging system on career mode. Championship mode is enough for me, but I guess I'm in a part of the minority on that one\n-the game crashes on exit\n-Non realistic practices sessions\n-the steering wheel display could display more useful information\n-still no installation lap...\n-sometimes, the leaderboard is not getting updated in time trial mode (bug)\n-the HUD has not evolved much since F1 2010\n-Penalty system for corner cutting is annoying: it doesn't mind if you cut on Chicane at Spa and gained 1 full second, but it gives a 10-second penalty (25%race) when putting 2 tires out on 130 R and losing some time at Suzuka. Ridiculous.\n\nConclusion\nThe series have been overhauled with a 'new' game engine, but it's hampered by teething issues and limitations so it needs some maturation before the major bugs get ironed out, and more features to come for the next year.\n\n6.3/10.","July 10, 2015","false","20.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I now get full AI opponents in a multiplayer lobby. THat's it. I'm never paying for a Codemasters F1 game ever again.\n\nUpdate 2 : 04/08/15 : This edit is regarding the 31/07 patch. After playing the game for 4 days after the patch, it seems like the Codies are making slow progress towards fixing the patches. A lot of annoying bugs have been ironed out and framerates during gameplay is also much better but they have yet to fix one major issue with this game and that is MULTIPLAYER. It is more broken now than ever. I just can't find one single lobby or hopper or whatever they're calling it now to play in. This needs a fix and my review will stay negative till then.\n\n\nUpdate 1 : 23/07/15 : Okay, it seems the 20/07 patch pushed in by the codies has fixed a few issues like framerate drops and crashes but it does not fix ALL the issues. There are still a few stutters here and there and needs a lot more fixing. The multiplayer is still broken and I'm still getting kicked from sessions for no bloody reason so my recommendation is still a NO.\n\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW : This game...this could be so much more than it is right now. I don't know where to begin. This game is just BROKEN.\n\nThe graphics are an obvious improvement from the previous titles and the handling seems a bit realistic than before but you buy racing games to have fun and I don't think I've had much fun with this game until now.\n\nThe game is marred with bugs and the multiplayer is just broken. I joined a hopper sprint in excitement to play my first ever multiplayer online on this game and the race doesn't start for me. I know this because the other people in the lobby keep screaming at each other that they someone rammed into someone else and he had to lose his front wing, etc. So, I decide to quit and rejoin the hopper. I have no idea how but the hopper shows that I finished second and scored 18 points. As I rejoined the hopper, the other guys got furious at me and started abusing me and questioning me as to how I scored 18 points when I left the lobby and kicked me from the game. What a horrible experience that was. I still haven't come around to playing one single multiplayer game. What a shame!\n\nAs to the Championship Mode, it's a meh. I have no idea why Codemasters decided to take away the customization options as to how one approaches a weekend race, be it one shot quali, short weekend or the full weekend experience. All that is gone now and you are left with no choice to play the game by their rules. Such a fail!\n\nThe quick race mode is nothing new. Just play a boring single race and come back to the home screen. Not much improvement other than that.\n\nI haven't played the pro-season mode yet and I don't feel like I should be playing it either as you won't have any sort of assists and camera customization options and since I use a keyboard and not a racing wheel, it is almost impossible to control the oversteer on the cars in this game without traction control cranked to full. This is another one of those meh issues in the game.\n\nThe graphics are great but the optimization for the PC is terrible. TERRIBLE! This could've been done so much more better. There are also just so many bugs in the game, it just takes away the enjoyment of racing an F1 car. The pit-lane graphics and sounds are just horrible and there are sudden framerate drops all over. There is nothing we can do but hope that the Codies fix this stuff in the coming patches.\n\nIf you are really interested in F1 and want to immerse youself in an experience which is enjoyable as well as challenging, I suggest you buy the F1 2010 or 2013 game(s). These guys are just taking more stuff away with every iteration of the game.","July 17, 2015","false","114.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I don't want that to be removed as it's part of the realism and these things can happen in a race, but A bit more sense from the AI and some penalties would be nice. Oh, just under a lap after I exited the pits my game crashed.\n\nAlso I the game looks washed out when it's raining, it looks colourless. It actually gives me a bit of a headache playing more than an hour.\n\nOther than that I love the new wear settings, it's quite realistic (I've yet to see engine wear), but the damage graphics are complete rubbish. It looked so much better in the last 4 games, in this game you don't see anything but you're told that you've taken damage, though it's rare since these cars seem to be built like tanks. Vettel ran into the back of me at speed while I was braking and he continued on without so much as a loss in speed while I spun off and took no damage. It is set to full damage before you ask.\n\nA step up in some ways and a step down in a lot of other ways.

Consider this before buying.\n\n== GAMEPAD / INPUT ==\n01. If you are using a game pad (Xbox 360 or Xbox One), wait for a patch before you buy the game. Currently this game doesn't work as advertised with mentioned peripherals. Buttons "B" in menu system are actually "A" when pressed. In the game itself it's even worse: The defaults are messed up unlike in previous F1 titles by Codemasters. If you start a race, you're engine is revving, but you just can't do a bloody thing... Remapping the buttons doesn't help either - the Xbox gamepad just isn't supported as it's advertised.\n02. No sliders & adjustments for deadzone and input control.

I was really hyped for this game, but my god they screwed it up.\n\n+Better and cleaner UI\n+Better AI, the AI actually overtakes you this time\n+Beautiful lighting\n+Realistically modeled cars\n+You can push the car more due to less unpredictable wheelspin\n+Both the 2015 and the 2014 F1 seasons are playable\n+Better commentery/tv-style\n+Tire sqeal can finally be heard properly\n\n-Game crashes alot\n-FPS drops are common, dropping to 9 FPS and staying there very frequently\n-Colours are very washed out\n-I cannot look back in the 3rd person view\n-Engine sounds are far too quiet\n-Limited Anti-Aliasing options, WHERE IS MSAA?\n-Blur, motion blur cannot be deactivated, WTF?\n-No introduction scene before the race start like in previous games\n-AI likes to punt you in the wall in some corners, for example Eau Rouge\n-The graphics are messed up, everything is very blury and smeary, absolutely horrific, WTF HAPPENED?\n-No safety car, WTF ARE YOU THINKING CM?\n-No Co-op, WTF ARE YOU THINKING CM?\n-FFB is horribly weak and inacurrate, almost no effects, worse than every before in a CM F1 game, WTF HAPPENED?\n-Why is it not possible to adjust each session length in championship mode?\n-Damage model is pathetic and far too forgiving, wait is this 2005 or 2015?\n-Rev counter on the steering wheel is still broken and far too short like in F1 2014\n-ALT+TAB does not work properly\n-Hardly any tire smoke when locking up\n-Long loading times\n\nPC specs: i7 4790k, r9 290, 16GB DDR3, G27 for more info see my profile\n\nAll in all I cannot recommend this game in its current state, the game is completely screwed, lacking featuires and will make you want to buy a pair of glasses. To be honest F1 2014 is probaly a better buy. I think I might test Steam's refund policy.\n\n10.07.2015, F1 2015 v.1.0\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEDIT:\n\nSo after raging quite a bit yesterday I completed a few 25% quick races on different tracks with some of the 2015 and 2014 spec F1. Championship mode is literally unplayable due to it bein at 9 FPS the entire time. So in this small list I will go into the actual racing aspect of F1 2015 and the changes compared to last years game.\n\n+Handling model has been vastly improved, more traction, less unpredictable wheelspin, the rear of the car is still quite a challenge which is good\n+The AI actually races you this time around, there is lots of wheel to wheel action, and the AI even completes switchback moves and dosen't back out of a move very often\n+Pits stops are now just as quick as in real life and the times vary per team and your crew can mess up\n+The AI is not as slow on the first lap, like in previous games\n+Fuel management is now realistic becuase upshifting early and lifting and coasting actually make a difference\n+The AI race each other with realistic consequences\n+Front wing gets damags more easily\n+The effects of dirty are are noticable\n+Wet racing is possible again, due to the AI not being overpowered anymore\n+AI make mistakes and it is great to see them having to deal with oversteer and slipping on the grass\n+The sparks that fly from the car directly infront of you are implemented very well\n+Penalty system usually fairly affects AI cars\n+Racing is just more fun with all cars batteling each other a lot of the time, going 3-wide into corners and stuff like that\n+AI causes crashes\n+More cinematics, grid walk podium etc.\n+You can ask the engineer for information\n\n-AI is not aware of you when it is rejoining the track and subsequently knocks you off\n-AI cars which need to be lapped do not get out of the way most of the time, therefore endangering your race\n-The rev counter on the in-game steering wheel is still wrong, just like last year\n-When exiting the pits with the pit assist option deactivated you are stuck in 2nd gear, therefore you lose a lot of time\n-The AI is always, and I repeat ALWAYS faster than you in a straight line, I have had Mclaren-Hondas pull away from me whilst I am driving a Force India and using DRS\n-2015 and 2014 car balance is not correct: 2015: Mclaren, Red Bull, Sauber too strong; Mercedes powered cars too weak (The cars are correctly balanced when you are driving them, but not when the AI is driving them, 2014: Mclaren is too powerful, haven't tested the rest (Again the AI cars are not balanced for example the Marussia is not runnung in the back like the Caterhams are)\n-There are alot of races where the weather is grey and dark and it is raining, but the track dosen't look wet and the dry tires work significatly better than the intermediates\n-The AI like to drive away from you in a train most of the time and you don't have a chance due to them blitzing down the straights\n-The damage model is pathetic and way too forgiving most of the time\n-The side pod glitch has kinda moved to the area between the sidepod and the front wheels, touch a car there and you just spin\n-The fuel mode menu is too slow, so that it takes too long to switch between modes whilst driving\n-The "talk to the engineer menu" dissapears way to quickly after opening it, therefore rendering it useless\n-No tire smoke when youn lock tyres, or cars spin, therefore there are no immersive "trying to avoid an incident which has occured ahead" moments\n-Blury graphics and motion blur really strain the eyes after ~30 mins\n-When it start raining and you have to change ti intermidiate tyres and you do so on your schedueled pit stop and haven't used the menu to select the intermidiate tyres, you will have slicks put on during the pit stop, this affects the AI most of the time too\n-DRS is often enabled in wet conditions\n-A lot of scenarios where you better of with slicks on a wet track\n\nAll in all the actual racing have vastly improved over last years game, now if codies would just address the blury graphics, add MSAA then this review would be positive and this game would be worth a buy.","July 10, 2015","false","103.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","1"

When the game came out it was already bad enough on the PC but some of the recent patches have improved the experience on the PC. However with this latest patch the AI is even more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ than ever. Racing as Bottas I was confidently leading the Australian Grand Prix until the second to last lap where my team mate who was already lapped tries to be some sort of hero and he goes on to overtake me. He crashes into the back of me and then we both go completely spinning. Luckily I was 30+ sec ahead so I was still able to get back on track to lead the race. Then on the last lap my car goes absolutely bonkers and decides to stop working on the last couple of corners for no apparent reason. After being sent spinning again another car completely smashes into me and I have to retire a couple of corners from victory.\n\nWith this latest patch the AI is even more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in getting out of the way when they are lapped. Instead of  pulling to the side they go completely straight out into a wall and most likely end up damaging their front wing or the entire car. And there are other problems like sitting on your team mate' ghost car when you go to pit or not getting out of the pits as well.There are other massive issues like big FPS drops when the into is played in the rain. I could go on and on.\n\nDo not buy this.","August 23, 2015","false","50.6"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","13","23","2","0"

I have had nothing but problems with this game.\n\n1. My G25 wheel and peddles,  which has worked on every other racing game without fail now has so many issues. This game will not allow me to use the brake and accelerator because they both register as (slide 1) which means that its one or the other and I have to use my clutch as the brake which gives me no feel. When I contacted Codemasters I got a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t generic reply stating that I am able to custemise the controlls. Which from owning all of their other games I am well aware of but is totaly useless when their game registers multiple peddles as the some one. Not to mention that their standatd G25 controlls do not even allow the use of the peddles.\n\n2. When I play their fancy new PRO SEASON which I was really looking foward to which is meant to have no assists and hardest difficaulty. When I stared first prectice in melbourne all assists a ON and I mean ALL assists. And No i was not in the other championship moad because that works fine with all assists off. The PRO mode, even thought is says that the assists are off still displays the racing line along with all other assissts. Again when I contatcted Codmasters their reply was that I shound just turn them off. Which I cant because its PRO mode and it says they are already off.\n\nIf anyone have any resolutions to these issues please leat me know because at this point the game is unplayable, I've wasted money and Im going back to play Project cars and F1 2014 until they are fixed.","July 14, 2015","false","37.2"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","14","25","0","1"

No cool career mode where you have your own character. Acceleration and braking online with a controller has no sensitivity, so you either tap it a little and it'll accelerate massively or not. Every time someone joins the lobby, an extra minute is added to the launch time. When you tab out, the resolution of the game ♥♥♥♥s up and the size goes all weird, resulting in you having to go back to settings and change it all to 1920x1080 etc. Not user friendly. Doesn't give you a description of what some game modes are. No tutorial. Characters look worse than Garry's mod characters.

To my mind it feels enjoyable and challenging with all assists off.\n\nNow here's the rub, forgetting the lack of features, because as far as I am concerned, if this game played as it should, I'd have overlooked that being this is a rewritten engine etc.\n\nThere are a few bugs and niggles but I have played many of the other games and for all their faults there was never a problem with the force feedback. This game has so little sensation of wheel weight or contact with road surface. and I have a wheel that works fine with previous games. So how many weeks will I have to wait before my wheel gives me the proper sensation of racing? I have posted so much on the forum, and yet nothing. All I ask is that it works with my steering wheel like it used to. Or like it does with project cars to be honest, as that does a better job.\n\nTill then I won't recommend it to anyone and Codemasters really let me down this time and I'm usually a patient gamer.\n\n*edit: I have a new wheel now, (T300) and the feeling is better with this wheel, but I am still not happy with this game overall. The feedback is passable, but should be better and have much more flexible option to adjust. Thing is, this is a console game first and a PC game second, which is a shame. Codemasters support for this game is almost non-existant as well, and the same errors creep into the game year on year.\n\nI hope that from the news I am hearing, Codemasters are going to focus on their key franchises from here on in, and if they want my help, they will get it. The potential has always been there, F1 one on early -access anyone? Maybe we will get that telemetry we have wanted for ages after all.","August 13, 2015","false","42.0"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

Following install the game failed to start, blank screen for a few minutes and then thrown back to the desktop.  After a couple more tries I restarted my computer and the game finally loaded.  I set everything to Ultra and then ran benchmark.  Noticed the left rear tyre flashing in out of existence when the camera was following my car from behind, minor glitch maybe.  Seeing that my 980Ti easily delivered around 120fps 1440p I decided to engage vsync to limit the game to 60fps as there is no point wasting all that electricity on all those extra frames.  Graphically the game looks a bit cartoonish to me and feels more like an arcade game than a simulation. Hitting walls and other cars doesn't seem to cause any harm or damage, which kind of suprised me as F1 2010 definately felt like a simulation and in my view remains the better game.  On completing a quick race I noticed some rather more serious screen glitches in the post race sequences, though again I expect this will be fixed in future updates or drivers.  Also the replays seem to be fixed at 30fps which is strange. After another quick flick through the menus and not finding anything new of interest I had a quick race around Monaco and found this offered little excitment.  On quitting the game I was presented with Steam error 41; which is a new one for me; something about servers being overloaded or something but to be honest by this point I was beyond caring.  It remains disappointing that Codemasters do not support my old Microsoft Sidewinder wheel and peddles; particuarly given that Project Cars does; so instead I have to use an Xbox joypad. For me this speaks volumes about the quality of the games, attention to detail and the values of this company.  Overall, if you are formula one nut and have a compatible steering wheel then maybe you'll enjoy this game but anyone who has played Project Cars will feel completely underwhelmed by quality of this game.","July 10, 2015","false","1.6"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

But now the game recovered and become good again, but, there's still some feature missing, most noticeably is the career mode, we need those we buy f1 games to become another driver, not to control a real driver in a season mode. In the end F1 2015 is good, but compared to previous games it's just stand out crap.

You do have the new engine which is pretty great graphically, the new physics are really good and it's really fun to play. The AI is also better then the years before. They drive more agressively (i.e. attack you on the outside of a corner etc.) and make less misstakes just by themselves, but of course also try to overtake you with smokeing tyres sometimes. Good job there. But then you run into a bug...\n\nAnd that's the problem, there are many bugs, which sometimes prevent you from even finishing a race (getting stuck in the pits or something like that). There are some other glitches which are pretty annoying. Some people even say, that the game crashes from time to time, which, I must say, has never happened to me so far. But there is one dealbreaker which makes game game bad right now...\n\nMultiplayer on PC simply is not playable. 90% of the time, you don't even find a lobby and when you do, most of the times the game gives you a disconnect just short before the start of the race.\n\nSo is the game bad? No it's not, it's just not out of beta test as of now. There is a really strong foundation here, and it would really be a good game, once all the bugs are fixed. So my verdict is:\nIf you just want to play single player and enjoy good racing against AI, you could get the game if you don't mind a bug here or there... You could of course also wait till the bugs are fixed.\nIf, however, you want to play multiplayer, don't get it! Wait till the bugs are confirmed to be fixed, and then you have yourself a good game to play.","August 16, 2015","false","10.8"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","9","16","0","0"

I think it deserves better reviews. Sure, the lack of the progressive season mode is a shame but when you get past that, the improvements far outweight that small negative (that said, I don't do multiplayer so have no opinion on pro's or cons).\n\nThe physics of the car are out of this world. I had F1 2013 and it felt like the car was on rails. The F1 2015 cars feel like they are on the edge when you're lapping. You can FEEL the understeer and oversteer through the wheel and putting together a fast lap is very rewarding as the physics will punish you for over-doing things.\n\nTyre degradation and fuel management are now in your hands. You can slow down a tad and save tyres and fuel to change your race strategy. There is no option to change strategy before the race starts but you aren't "forced" to pit like in F1 2013. If you choose to race flat out, you will have to make an extra stop compared to a more conservative approach..\n\nThe only other oddity is the AI speed. On Hard, it's fairly easy to qualify and race in the top three. Moving up to Expert, I was struggling to get in the top ten. Hopefully they'll patch it to make the gap a bit less radical. The AI also has a propensity to punt you off the track from time to time. Generally they race very well and you can force them into mistakes but it's very irritating to be on the correct line and suddenly "BOOM" you're spinning off the track.\n\nI highly recommend giving it a try. If you are bent out of sdhape by the lack of the young driver program you are missing out on a great racing sim for something that was only a fraction of the game.","December 2, 2015","true","47.5"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","9","16","0","0"

Let's see.  Graphics no better than the previous games.  Unintuitive and unattractive menus.  Multiplayer menu / lobby system is confusing and badly designed.  All Codemasters have to do is look at how other developers do it, and copy them.  But no, Codemasters seem to think they know better.  They don't.   No easy universal option to mute other  players voice chat in multiplayer, which is enabled by default.  The only way to do it is choose 'mute all' EVERY time you play a game.  It will not remember your setting.  And if another player joins after you chose this option, you will have to manually go and mute them too.  What a pathetically bad design.\n\nMultiplayer has unacceptably long delays compared to other racing games I've played.  Long delays annoy people and are not conducive to keeping players playing, we have other things to do, rather than stare at screens for minute after minute after minute waiting, and waiting, and waiting.  There should be short timers so that if someone isn't ready yet then it's too bad, he shouldn't be able to keep the rest of the players waiting forever.\n\nIn my first race online I got bashed off at the first corner and while I know this can happen in any racing game online, what is not acceptable is the fact that *I* received a WARNING for the contact.  Me.  A warning for something which wasn't my fault and was out of my control.\n\nUninstalled.","March 17","false","0.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

The engine is anything but a complete rewrite still having bugs that have been around since 2010, the game is crashing, there's a distinct lack of game modes compared to the previous titles, no career mode and a broken multiplayer mode, no safety car, cringe-inducing commentary, the penalty system is still a joke punishing you for things you haven't done (like the AI ramming you from behind), the graphics completely suck only because Codemasters once again felt like this is some freaking Instagram or something and had to put in their filters making it look like a blury mess with a cherry on top in the form of chromatic aberration which you cannot turn off. It's making my eyes bleed, rendering the broken game even more unplayable.\n\nThe handling model might be a bit better than before, but other than that? No, just don't get this game.

Codemasters are incapable of making a good racing game these days. I got this free with a purchase of a laptop and even then I'm disappointed with it.\n\nThe graphics look good on my gaming PC, better than F1 2013 (the last one I bought) and there are no issues there other than it can look cartoony due to the colour saturation. The driving is very smooth and for the most part the game plays at well over 60 fps on max settings, but there are cases where the performance just goes through the floor. And I don't mean consistently either, you can lap a track several times with no issues and then for whatever reason, on the following lap, the framerate will halve and stay there, feeling like a slideshow after playing at 80 fps or higher.\n\nThe cars are very easy to drive and there's no real difificulty from the AI that I have seen. I have most of the assists off and use a gamepad, but the game doesn't seem to ever save my assist settings so I don't know if it reset my assists back to all enabled. I raced against medium AI around a couple of tracks and won the majority of races. Bear in mind I was in the Mercedes so a slower car would have faced more difficulty.\n\nThe game is very light on features. There's no career, no online co op, no split screen (co op or otherwise) and I'm sure there's more missing. The session browser list for online is gone, instead there are hopper lobbies which take ages to fill up or are always empty. Once you're in an online game, it takes ages to load everyone in and once you're racing the poor penalty system will ruin your fun. Just had a race where I covered someone off on the inside line, they corner cut to overtake, hit me and take us both into the gravel and I got the penalty. Had another after that where I go to turn, accidentally tag somebody so I turn out to prevent causing an accident, still get the penalty (other player did spin though). If it weren't for the poor penalty system that seems too happy to dish out penalties I'd be more likely to recommend this game.\n\nThis game also features non-existant force feedback. I can run over curbs and things and get no feedback from the controller. By comparison, Project Cars, you feel everything. I don't know what's good about this game really. Barebones features, poor penalty system, struggle to find games, takes ages to load everyone in, awful sound design, and not all that fun. 5 out of 10 at best","December 9, 2015","false","21.7"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

The main reason for this thumbs down is the error 41 crash that plauges codemasters new games! Same issue that haunts its also excellent dirt rally (still in early access) Until they fix this issue for everyone its a real dealbreaker. These are the only two games i own across two systems that crash out with error 41. When you have races that last as long as these you just cant be putting up with frequent crashing! PLEASE FIX!\nIn terms of graphics i must say their other title Dirt Rally looks way better! To my eyes the main reason is the massively overdone motion blur which softens the life out the visials making the textures looks really poor. You only have to pause it mid race to see just how much detail is actually lost by over use of the motion blur effect. Whats more annoying is the lack of option to turn motion blur off!?!\nComon codemasters, i expect way, way more of you.

I do however hope to see the ones that are in the game still ironed out and I do NOT forgive Codemasters for releasing a broken game.\n\nThird, I would like to comment on the gameplay, it is vastly improved on the 2014 game and it feels like a true racing experience and I enjoy the game a lot whether it is online or offline, with or without bugs, as most of the bugs when I'm playing are just hilarious anyway.\n\nFourth, I'm with the whole community when they say they want their REd Flags and their Safety Car back in the game as they made the experience that more real when playing and they are essential in the game, especially where the AI are dumb in Monaco. I'd love to see a parade lap that's toggleable and I'd really enjoy a bump in the difficulty of the game when you're in the better cars on the grid, as it seems a little easy to convert poles into wins on high overtake capacity tracks when you're in cars such as Ferrari and Mercedes.\n\nOverall, yes I recommend this game, however make sure that you have a compatable controller or wheel prior to buying it, I use a wireless Xbox 360 controller and some cheap reciever and they're okay. It's fun and if you don't mind waiting for some features or for bugs to be fixed then definitely pick this game up.","August 13, 2015","true","100.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","2"

Driving as Jenson Button, I have just completed the Australian GP on full race distance...no frame rate dips whatsoever, a smooth 60fps for 58laps. Handling is so improved and thus helps with consistency. Tyre wear is also more accurate with timely information from your engineer as to the state of your tyres...I got 14 laps out of the 'option' tyres and easily got 18 laps out of the 'prime' tyres before I had to pit. A.I. is more competitive and they make mistakes too...24 race incidents after the Australian GP!\nThe engineer is vastly improved, not only does he give consistent, accurate information on tyre wear, he also informs you of fuel use, weather, lap times and time gaps between your nearest rivals.\nGraphically, it's an improvement over F1 2014 but it's no real showcase for next generation graphics. Crowd and officials are still oddly static and cardboard like, but that's only seen in the replays. Tracks are nicely detailed and accurate, although I noticed some 'blocky' trees and foliage, and I'm running the game on Ultra High settings.\nCommentary is limited to before and after the race...it's serviceable, it gets the job done!\nReplays are better as you can now cycle through all the cars in the race and watch them racing...something Psygnosis could do back in the 90's with their F1 game on PS1...but it's a nice addition. Only wish they would add a UI over the replays that gave you the lap, driver, laptimes etc.\nI could mention everything that's missing, but I won't because a 100,000 other people have probably already done that across the internet.

The crashfest which was the released F1 2015 has been fixed and now seems stable. After testing the latest patch (22/7) I did not get any appcrashes or the notorious error 41.\nThe AI has improved (IMHO) and doesn't rear end your car with monotonous frequency. It still happens but mostly as a result of excessively hard braking into a corner. The game still has issues with fault though, expect to be blamed for every collision whether or not you were on line and in front into a corner.\nSome of the menu operations are awkward such as the car setup "pad". Having to type in a save filename everytime gets tedious especially when you just want to update and overwrite an existing setup.\nI find now the racing pretty enjoyable. I don't have any particular problem with blur (@2560x1440) that some have mentioned and get a solid 60fps on a GTX980ti at absolutely maximum settings. I found the graphics initially appeared washed out with poor contrast which I tweaked up with sweetfx and now looks good to my eye (this may not necessarily be the game but an Nvidia driver issue). There is no sli support as yet. Control options are still very poor. I still can't get my wheel working but have sorted out a decent 360 controller setup after manually editing the file. Value of this F1 2015 over F1 2013 (I've skipped 2014) is debatable. Graphically it is moderately better but other than that losses out in features (and my wheel works in 2013). After the crash fixes I'd recommend it with a few caveats.\n\n\nOriginal review: This isn't a review of the game but the state of the game. Very, very, broken. You will crash alot but not into other cars, mainly the desktop. Get used to closing the Appcrash error box because you are going to get RSI doing it. In thirty minutes of play, it has crashed every few minutes at many different points; menus, benchmark, in game and even crashes exiting and causes the Steam client to crash with it.\nGraphically it looks good and runs smoothly but that's where the fun ends. Controller support is broken. Wouldn't recognise my wheel other than as an Xbox controller so it locks me out of wheel setup. Xbox controller support allows remapping of buttons only. No sensitivity, dead zone, gamma etc. Anyway using the controller is like digital steering, you may as well steer with the cursor keys.\nIf the game gets patched up into a reasonable state it maybe OK but as it stands it's just another case of a PC game getting released without any quality control at all.","July 10, 2015","true","48.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I do however hope to see the ones that are in the game still ironed out and I do NOT forgive Codemasters for releasing a broken game.\n\nThird, I would like to comment on the gameplay, it is vastly improved on the 2014 game and it feels like a true racing experience and I enjoy the game a lot whether it is online or offline, with or without bugs, as most of the bugs when I'm playing are just hilarious anyway.\n\nFourth, I'm with the whole community when they say they want their REd Flags and their Safety Car back in the game as they made the experience that more real when playing and they are essential in the game, especially where the AI are dumb in Monaco. I'd love to see a parade lap that's toggleable and I'd really enjoy a bump in the difficulty of the game when you're in the better cars on the grid, as it seems a little easy to convert poles into wins on high overtake capacity tracks when you're in cars such as Ferrari and Mercedes.\n\nOverall, yes I recommend this game, however make sure that you have a compatable controller or wheel prior to buying it, I use a wireless Xbox 360 controller and some cheap reciever and they're okay. It's fun and if you don't mind waiting for some features or for bugs to be fixed then definitely pick this game up.","August 13, 2015","true","100.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","2"

There is a sence of control that is a level above the previous releases and that is the main thing about a racing game.\n\nThere are two negatives.  I suspect both are fairly straight forward to address.  The 1st is the online experience in the hoppers is very poor.  The lobby does not tell you what is going on very well.  The countdown to start seems to reset itself.  The vote to skip track countdown replaces the countdown to start, which seems to reset itself again.  The 2nd is GUI elements to navigate the game.  I'm a PC user with a G27 wheel.  On some screens, console buttons (X, B, Y, etc) appear.\n\n\nThese are both quality issues rather than gameplay.  The online hopper issue seems to really affect gamers decision whether to stay or leave in my opinion and it feels quite broken from a accessibilty POV.  The GUI navigation issues are presentation issues which do not affect actually navigating through the game.  The standard keyboard controls still work.\n\nThe single player mode is solid.  The annoying forced learning to control the car from the previous is gone.  I'm personally happy that the career mode is gone.  It wasn't really challenging and was a grind for achievements.  I'm enjoying the handling elements a lot.  The game engine is solid.\n\n..just remembered 1x game play quirk.

I realise I'm in the minority here, but if you give me a moment I'll clarify my point of view.\n\nFirst of all, this game is not perfect. It has bugs. It has missing features (you don't have a player career mode, you can't drive as yourself, there are practise sessions still missing). But what it lacks in features it makes up for in the racing.\n\nThe races are good! Okay, if you drive as Lewis Hamilton, you're quickly going to take the lead and drive away from the pack. But f you choose, say, Button's McLaren or a Sauber, you're going to have a race on your hands to reach your teams goal (which is usually to finish in the top 10).\n\nThe AI are pretty decent, they will give you a tough fight, they no longer back out of overtaking in the braking zones, and they'll go for small gaps.\n\nI've noticed a bug where you're sometimes called into the pits on the same lap as your team mate and have to stack up behind, but it doesn't happen all the time. And you can get around it by pitting a lap later.\n\nWeather modelling is about the same as always, so no problems there.\n\nThe damage could do with being a bit more sensitive. I crashed into a driver who braked suddenly in front of me, and I suffered no damage even with full damage enabled. Front wings need to be more fragile.\n\nAside from these problems, which are easy enough to work around, it's a good game. Is it the best F1 game ever? No, not by a long shot. But it's OK.\n\nDon't expect too much. Go into it expecing a no frill, no nonsense F1 racing game. It's not a full on sim, but it's not an arcade game either.","July 12, 2015","true","55.5"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","10","21","0","0"

I had some initial issues with menus/graphics but now the game seems to be running smoothly (at least on my rig) here are some thoughts:\n\n1. Graphics - much has been made on here of the blurring and I experienced this myself initially.  Once I realised the game was selecting the onboard graphics by default rather than my dedicated graphics card I was able to change my card settings and it was like playing a different game.  On ultra settings the game is visually very good and the sense of speed is palpable.\n2. Control - I'm one of those troglodytes who still uses the keyboard so I can't comment on the gamepad/wheel issues experienced by others.  Keyboard preset 2 appears to be unusable due to some glitch in the handling when you select that preset but using the standard keyboard setup the handling is very good.\n3. AI - a lot has also been made of cars running into the back of you in races.  In the quick race I tried, the only time someone ran into the back of me was when I made a stupid driving error.  Otherwise the cars behind behaved very well and the pressure of the pack breathing down my neck really added to the feel of the game.\n\nOverall I would give this a big thumbs up.  Hopefully the bugs will be rectified quickly so that everyone can enjoy the experience.","July 13, 2015","true","7.8"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","7","15","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ats7/recommended/286570/","ats7","AThousandSuns7","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ats7/","94 products in account","Update for September 3rd patch\nMany improvements have been made, fixing car glitches, crashes, settings, and controls. Almost all original issuses have been fixed. The only thing that really still remains (for me) is blue flag issues. I feel better recommending this game in the state it is now compared to what it was like on release.\n\nCodemasters really put out a good game, and they are continuing to work on it. It should have shipped without most of these issues, but they are doing a really good job fixing them when they come up. Thanks for the game Codies. Well done.\n\n\nOriginal Review\nF1 2015 is a really good game. In fact, I would have to say it's the best in a while, despite the flaws.\n\nClearing things up:\nChampionship Mode IS Career Mode. You just don't race as yourself. Is that so bad?\nIt's not supposed to be a complete sim. Its supposed to have an arcade feel. Want it to feel real? Go driving.\nYou always have really needed a pad or wheel for F1 games. Keyboard has never worked (well).\nWhats hot:\nNew engine, nice to get away from the past few titles graphics wise. Looks great too.\nAI are majorly improved. They actually race you, and the other AI. Treat them well and you can have great battles.\nAlso includes 2014. May seem like a gimmick, but it does add extra playability with the (somewhat old) cars and tracks.\nLeaderboards you can take setups from in Time Trial.\nRestart lap and quick car/track swapping from menus in Time Trial.\nPro Season mode is an immersive, enjoyable way to race if you have some time and skill.\nTyre wear is better, I was able to push longer than previous games.\nMuch better fuel managment, I have never ran out of fuel in a race until now.\nWhats not:\nBig one first. Multiplayer. It simply doesn't work. Not big for me, but huge for most.\nButton maps in menus are bad. X to go back on menus, B to go forward (for me, MadCatz Xbox Wireless Racing Wheel)\nDownshift to second when leaving pits. Really, really annoying.\nNo safety car.\nBad career mode settings. Why can't I have 25% race with full qualifying?\nExtremely varying track limits in Time Trial. You can cut the first corner at Hockenheim but God forbid you run a tad wide on exit.\nOccasional crash on startup.\nTrys to launch game after closing it.\nNumerous other glitches (No tyres, invisible car, etc.)\nI'm having fun with F1 2015. I figure I will continue to have fun with it. You can get past the glitches, and the game is completely playable. Despite the 66% negative reviews at the time of writing, I think that this game is really good. I plan to sink many an hour into battling with the AI and setting top times.","July 12, 2015","true","133.2"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","6","13","0","0"

Yep, because it's not so bad as described.\nYes, this is was a mistake to release F1 2015 in early year. Otherwise, it would be possible to eliminate interface (control) errors. Then the game would received more positive reviews.\n\nIt lacks a career mode that allows you to transition out of 14th year season to 15th. And I'm not talking about a career in which for example for Williams can fight some "W0menLorD2003". No, because a real pilot has certain sponsors. Needless to talk about PDVSA, etc. With the current system of licensed pilots, it looks more realistic, and I like it.\n\nFiddled with software of my device, I was able to achieve good handling. I want to note that driving in 2015th game is more Interesting and complicated than in F1 2014. This is a big step forward.\nOf course, the graphics has become better. I like colors in F1 2015, but, of course, blur spoil all the experience. And modes do not fix it to the full. Here's another example of the console port. :\ However, I liked the game menu and its "soundtrack".\n\nMany are dissatisfied with the lack of alcohol logos. Yes, like others, I want to see Martini logos on FW36 and 37 and in the team name. But have you ever thought about game's age rating? As I recall, the rating increase is costly. And this applies to all genre of games.\nAnother blunder is a SC, of course. I don't know why it was deleted. Sad, but true.\nUnfortunately, I did not see the manifestation of the great thinking of AI cars. AI became more agressive and only. But it can talk about my lack of experience.\n\nAt the same time the game has become more lively due to the staff, commentators, etc. Not as much as it could, but it looks more advantageous against the background of the 13th and 14th F1.\nThis is not the last game in the series, and devs have something to strive for. Taking into account its current mistakes, they are able to make a truly worthy project.

And then after all you have done is checked off, then do the olde basic complete shutdown and restart.  Not to discourage anyone but remember that this game was designed for the state of the art peripheral components, so an upgrade may be possible.\nDon't get me wrong but I also experienced all the issues that everyone mentioned in previous posts, and I do not not have the strongest rig, but those steps (mentioned above) really helped me to play and enjoy  the Formula 1 series which I love so much.I hope this helps more virtual drivers out there to be able to get on the tracks and enjoy this beautiful Formula 1 game for our PC version and kick some next gen arses.

And this is ona  straight so its no reflection of the quality of the driving. There no way they should do that on an easy setting.\n\nController setting are minimal. Its ok if you have an 'advanced wheel' (whatever one of those is) but I have a joystick and you cant config it at all. No sensitivity settings for travelling at speed so you waver all over the track. Plus the game when I played it kept losing my controller settings every time I restarted. Also when I set the controller to joystick I couldnt use Esc to exit a session the only way to get out of a session was to stop on a racetrack and get black listed! You cant even exit from the pits. Terrible settings, terrible configuration.\n\nThe car AI is abysmal. They dont go around you they barge you off the track every time.\n\nOtherwise its not a bad game, graphics are good, I had no crashes in the short time I was trying the game, pits looked good, communications with the team were really good. And of course this is probably the only game where you can play the current season without mods.\n\nIn the end I used Steam refund policy to try the game and ended up getting a refund and bought Project Cars which is a far far far better game all around. But even rFactor2 is better than this game in terms of options, immersion, AI and driving experience.","July 12, 2015","false","1.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

The launch was terrible and I am glad the reviews were bad and Codemasters lost money. There is no excuse for that garbage they put out earlier this year. But after ~10 patches the game is finally good.\n\nThe good:- Graphics are beautiful and performance is fine\n- The AI is fantastic\n- The handling is better and doesn't feel like you are driving on rails\n- Actual performance differences between the cars - you won't be able to win with a Honda\n- More management from the driver is needed during the race (tyres, fuel, engine, brakes,...)\n- Dynamic weather\n- Great presentation and feel\n- Includes 2014 and 2015 season (which means we get Hockenheim)\n- FOV settings\n\nThe bad:- Multiplayer is a cluster♥♥♥♥ and not enjoyable\n- Some things feel scripted and not simulated\n\nVerdict:It is in my opinion the best F1 game we've had in years. It took a while to get here but it is an absolute cracker. The new AI and better handling make it feel like it is a totally new game (which is most likely is).

I'm delivering an indepth review.\nOk where do I start. I've followed Codies ever since Colin McRae Rally 2.0 (as stated in my previous reviews for Codies games) as an avid racer I couldn't wait to see what they could do with their first Next Gen release for Formula One.\n\nWell for a start I can see a repeat of their first series into the F1 Franchise with F1 2010. No safety car, non-dynamic weather, average AI. But that slowly built up as the sequals were released so I am hoping next years game will be more feature full.\n\nFocusing on this game. F1 2015 brings the 2015 season and the 2014 season into one package for the next gen consoles.\n\nGRAPHICS: The engine has been rebuilt (so they say) and everything has been reworked. The game looks and feels great, running at 60fps at 1080p on both my laptop, and my PS4 and looks absolutely stunning. The game looks its best in the wet weather where the detail is immense!\n\nHANDLING: The handling of the game has been reworked so the car feels more realistic but I feel the car is almost way to easy to stop under braking. It feels like ABS is always on, even though I don't use the Driving Aids. Wet weather conditions will make any racer nervous to stray off the racing line to attack, as you will most likely end up in the gravel.\n\nDAMAGE: This is one big letdown. The damage model of the car is virtually unchanged, while it may be easier to clip your front wing, its taken a backwards step compared to other games like Project Cars, rFactor 2, Asseto Corsa. Even their own DIRT Rally has a better damage model and it was released before F1 2015. There seem to be NO MECHANICAL FAILURES, like brakes, ERS failure, flat spots and the only time i get a puncture is if I deliberatly punt the car into the wall hard enough.\n\nAI: The AI have been reworked as well, I play on legendary settings and they seem to manage their tyres better while still keeping up with me, often performing better. I tried some tyre savings but dropped off the pace, may have to change my tactics. AI like to make mistakes, sometimes clashing with each other and losing a front wing but nothing special compared to f1 2013. Another thing is if an AI hit you (yes HIT YOU) they tend to push your car into the wall, or spin you, while they continue as if there was no contact.\n\nREPLAYS/FLASHBACKS: Replays now allow you to see the action from not just your car, but any car you wish so you can see just how awesome that crash was. However the replays are slighty broken as once you perform a flashback you cant go back and rewind further. This made me lose a race as while overtaking a backmarker on the last lap I got hit and spun into a wall, as I used a flashback I hit the button too late and it flashbacked to after the spin and was unable to use the feature again to get out of it.\n\nSETUPS: Setups are ok, a few nicks from me, I cannot change a setup during a quick race with no practice and no qualifying. Or if it rains while the qualifying was dry on low downforce packs the AI seem to have a leading edge in the rain, almost like their setup changed. Funny that.\n\nIn closing the game is the start of new things to come, it has bugs, its not feature full but its a good start of the Next Gen series. Compared to Dirt Rally (the sister game released prior) it feels like the F1 games don't get the development they need to be a great game for racers and feels unfinished. I still recommend this game however.\n","September 16, 2015","true","24.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Of course its not a hardcore racing simulation so dont expect it have nice physics like rFactor 2 for example. But for in between its a nice game, you can have much hours fun in the Singleplayer (Just like me). Also it runs on near Max Settings and high Frames per Second on those (my) PC components:\n\n- Intel Core I7 3770K 3,4GHZ\n- Nvidia GeForce GTX 750Ti 2GB VRAM\n- 8GB RAM Kingston HyperX\n\nSo yeah, this proofs that a GTX 750Ti can run this game on near Max settings @ 60FPS. Because much guys complaining about F1 2015 how bad the Framerates are, how bad it was ported, bla bla.. I dont have Problems with the game, very rare little bugs but they aren't a Fun Killer.\n\nThe Online Part of F1 2015 is not so good like the Singleplayer, because of different reasons when you play with randoms. (For Example lags, hackers, unfair driving, ramming, etc..)\nBut you can enjoy the Online Part of F1 2015 too if you are just playing with your friend in a private session (1vs1 for example) and with a couple of AI Drivers loaded.\n\nSo, i definitely recommend to buy F1 2015 for PC.","December 19, 2015","true","66.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

Now though, after all mthe updates that have been implemented to the game, my perspective has completely changed. More challenging, realistic, fun and competitive compared to the previous F1 releases. Codemasters had done a fantastic job with f1 2010 through to 2013, 2014 let them down a bit as the final game appeared to be just a car/sound update of 2013.\nThere are still areas of the game that need improving: parc ferme needs fixing so that tyres used in Q2 are locked for the race start unless its alternate weather, own use of ERS was promised by codies but so far hasn't appeared. Also, multiplayer still doesn't support a full compliment of 20 human racers, still the 16 from the previous titles.\n\nLets hope Codies can improve upon the current situation, but overall a good start for their first next gen F1 project.\n\nRating 7/10","July 22, 2015","true","585.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I'm only about 7-hours into it, but wow, great job with this release.  I just ignored all the negative reviews and jumped right in, knowing most of the negatives were prior to the many patches and fixes. My intorduction to 2015 was after all the new release hoopla and problems (just purchased 01/30/2016), and long after the patches and bug fixes were released, so I do not and have not suffered from all the issues you see in reviews that are 1-6 months old.   Also it's smooth as silk running at max settings with 1920x1080 resolution AMD 8320 8-core.\n\nI have 2014 as well and have fully enjoyed that on the PS3 and also just bought it for my PC, adding some nice graphic mods - 2014 is great looking in it's own right but with the new visual mods it's fantastic and with very cool game play options.  With that said, 2015 looks a little better but not a huge leap from 2014 imo, especially with visual mods added to 2014 - but 2015 looks better non-the-less unmoddd thus far.  The one thing is I don't see MSAA antialiasing, which is weird that 2015 wouldn't have that setting.\n\nNow the car and handling are much improved (ie harder to drive) with much better physics over 2014.  Need a very light touch on throttle and brakes or you'll feel like your driving on an ice rink (I only use medium TC assist, nothing else).  You have to finess the car handling and acceleration if you want to keep from crashing.  The first impression is the very real sensation and "feel" of driving the real thing; a highly unstable and fast F-1 racer - much much moreso than 2014.\n\nAfter driving 2015 for a several hours with practice laps/time trials, I jumped into 2014 and with all assists off it was almost easy and a little "rail like".  After all the difficulty I have with pushing the new 2015 platform it makes jumping into 2014 a much easier drive.  The actual feeling of driving in 2015 is there in all it's glory, muchmoreso than 2014, and '14 is no slouch imo (I know the iRacing guys will probably laugh).  So I'll do most of my heavy practicing in 2015 and use 2014 to race online and for it's neat carreer mode and vintage racers.\n\nAnd the audio in 2015....wow, that is something I noticed immediatly...so much fuller, louder, rich and deep.  The car and engine audio is leaps and bounds above 2014, very immersive.  The car, it simply screams!!\n\nI've not done any career races or online racing yet in 2015, so not sure about the AI or how well career mode is.  I do know you drive as a real driver, not as yourself, which is odd to me.  The career mode in 2014 is pretty cool, you get to do well and sign with better teams.  Not so with 2015 which is a dissapointment - oh well.\n\nAs for multiplayer, I guess there are still issues with the netcode for 2015 so it seems as of right now most of the online F1 leagues are racing with 2014 until Codeies fix 2015 multiplayer - hopefully soon.\n\nAll in all I'm loving it so far.  Not that deep into it yet, but I'm working on it.  I'd definately recomend it.  I just don't see where all the hate is coming from as I don't see anything that would merit it at all in its current state.  I assume alot of it comes from the pre patch versions, but who knows.  Expectations can get out of control I guess.\n\nEDIT:  Oh, one thing - no trackIR support for 2015 far as I can tell.  It works for 2014, but can't get it to function in 2015.\n\nMy $.02 worth!\n\nGood day,\n\nDrDetroit","February 2","true","85.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's repetitive as any racing game but it offers no incentive to play any further. Why play another 4 hours just to see 20 seconds of a "you won the championship" movie? You can fail objectives without punishment.\nThe animations after sessions are always the same and though the in game models are nicely modeled, the menu pictures of drivers and cars are just heinous.\nThe real gameplay is a conundrum: dynamic weather, flag rules, different performances all make for a great set up but driving feels wooden (especially on straights). I played without assistances (other than race line) and it doesn't take too long for you to master your car and catch Hamilton in every darn race.\nDifferent modes? You can play your usual short races through a season or go for the PRO SEASON (full length). Quick race, time trial, multiplayer. No legends, no career mode....\nIt's no arcady enough for people who just want to hold the acceleration button down and it's too daft and simple for people who want a racing game.","March 20","false","2.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I want to say it's the best version they've come out with in terms of accuracy, feel, and realism.\n\nI thought I wouldn't like that they got rid of "Career" mode, but honestly the only difference is you cannot name your character, big woop. (Oh and they got rid of the beginner driving thing at the start, this is a positive).\n\nMy only two complaints I have and they are pretty nitpicky, I was hoping for formation laps and manual pitting (instead of auto piloting to your crew). But then I realized (especially in multiplayer) people would fail to land on their real position on the grid, or run over their pit crew, and complain about that instead of setting up their graphics wrong.\n\nOverall, great game, pro season is awesome. Very tough (What I want).

As for the AI they are so much "lifely" & racing is so much better then before. btw is a switch for 2014 season mode as well, kinda cool addon, I quess.\n\nFor those who enjoyed the online CO-OP, I am afraid there isn't the option to do that anymore but even if there was a online CO-OP your time with it probably would not be that cool with the onlines "netcode" atm.\n\nFor the driving they have changed the pad turning "reaction" so you need to get a new grip for that if you are a pad user, the backend is pretty lose if you aren't carefull with your throttle & brakes are lot more realistic, I had to change almost all of my breaking points.\n\nConclusion:\nWait if you aren't so big into F1 games but still wan't to play them for those who love F1 games go for it if you can life without a career mode and online is what it is. Force feedback is okey with me, not the best but ain't the worst either (G25).\n\nGood:\nBetter grafics, The scenery behind tracks IS SO MUCH BETTER\nBetter Physics (with some funky crashes)\nBetter replay system\nBetter AI\nTwo season's 2014 & 2015\nTV format (I like it)\n\n\nThe Bad:\nCrashes & alot of gliches (prob going to be resolved)\nNo career mode\nNo CO-OP\nOnline is still has same problems as older F1 games\nSC or VSC not present","July 10, 2015","true","9.3"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

AI drivers are too aggressive and too fast in the straights, yet you can pass them in the corners every time.  Forget Multiplay. The real 2015 F1 cars have Kers but there doesn't seem to be a Kers button, only a DRS. Huh?\n\nThe one thing I like is that the time trial. It allows you to have ghost cars using other players times, so you are constantly trying to best another players time, and when you do you get access to a faster player and his set ups. Good idea.\n\nGraphics are better I guess but you'll need a new computer to see them. I have an I7 3770 with 1 gb Nvida card and 8gb ram but have to run in low res mode.  F1 2012 works fine.\n\nAll in all a dissappointment from F1 2012, the last game I bought in this franchise and overall a much better experience.\n\nDo yourself a favour, play Race 07 and the tons of mods available, then play F1 2015 and then tell me you like this game better. The Race 07 graphics are not as good, but the physics are better, the AI is better and adjustable, the loading screens are faster, the multiplayer is better and it has everything except flashback that you constantly need with F1 2015 because of the bad AI. Kudos to Race 07 and it's 8 year old engine.

I really enjoy all the F1 games so I was really waiting fo a sale to get this one. The game is great. I mean the graphics are improved and I love how the drivers look real and all that stuff. It makes game more fun. BUT... there is a huuuuge problem. The game is crashing A LOT. Today I cant even run it. It crashes on launch and a lot of times it crashes ingame. Like when you enter pits or go to garage via pause. Cant really suggest it and I think I will need to skip 2015 and wait for 2016s F1. Otherwise if they would fix this constant crashing it wouild be an awesome game!","March 18","false","3.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The AI actually fight you and go for overtakes and do crash into others and you WHICH is realistic but makes everyone rage. The graphics are beautiful and I like the 2014 content really but it seems less worked on. The online actually does work I've raced against other people and they are actually good. Cars are realistic, fun and hard to drive.\nBad stuff though: No safety car. Add this Codemasters in next update or explain why it's not in the game. No Career but I understand why Codemasters killed it to help with the license. Can be glitchy. It forgets my steerign wheel controls even though they're saved under custom. Legend AI are too easy won 17 races as Daniel Ricciardo. And the skins of cars are wrong at some tracks e.g. McLaren new dark and red livery wasn't on the car until Spain I think so I shouldn't be able to have it until Spain afterwards.\nOverall I'd say 8/10 haven't got any problems with it.

I do have a fairly new gaming setup so keep that in mind when considering my review.\n\nGraphics- 8/10 would be 10/10 if there were not the minor annoying glitches\nGame Modes- 7/10 fairly typical for a racing game but its tried and true\nNew Handling System- 10/10 i really enjoy this aspect and its a big improvement from 2013 which is the last F1 game I played\n","July 25, 2015","true","7.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

At half price I'm "Meh" on it at this time. So far I can't even get through a "quick race" without being pit manuvered by another car placing me at the back of the pack per race. That's gets pretty boring to constanly have happen. I have F1 2013 and been using it for like four monts also iRacing(bought direct from their site) for the same amount of time have a T-100(yeah entry level but affordable fun) so not like I'm brand new to FFB racing. F1 2013 I do take 1st place now and then Intermediate most assists off so also not a pro(to keep things clear). F1 2015 if tapped by another car you might as well just start the session over if you are trying to just get in the top ten for points let alone a podium stance. Wont happen. Slight tap and your into the gravel, a wall, other cars, time penalty, black flag(nice band bad for racing though lol). Ding time trials is pretty good though. Great graphics. The crew engineer is sort of nasty though. The feeling of the handling of the cars is better then F1 2013 IMO more realistic to the reality thing(no I haven't driven a actual Formula car, have had real cars that I wrenched on to make handling and all the rest better for racing so compared to those. One was full race suspension and steering, engine was mid rally. Boy does the auto insurance go way up scheezz!!!). I read all the bad reviews before buying 2015 but at half off I took a chance. I'm very boarder-line on recommend and not recommend but went with not because I just now once again got pit maneuvered into 17th place on the last turn of Monza after holding 1st place the rest of the race. I'll have to say I don't like doing reviews that are bad but after what just happened go figure. Besides, other people will have voiced my opinion already and much more eloquently too.","April 15","false","22.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheManko/recommended/286570/","TheManko","TheManko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheManko/","409 products in account","These are my updated F1 2015 impressions. Codemasters have tossed out every part of their old games and built a new one from scratch. It doesn’t look, feel or sound like the previous titles. It lacks features from the older titles, but the core game is much better than it ever was.\n\nLike the other Codemasters F1 games, F1 2015 requires concentration and finesse. I’m playing with a gamepad, and you just can’t mash full throttle and steering and hope to get to the other side of a corner pointing the right direction. The game uses the full possible range of analogue control available to create a remarkably deep and rewarding driving game. It’s the only racing game where I’m happy to drive around the same circuit for 20+ laps, as every moment is unique depending on the tire type, their temperature, the weather, the car damage, and whether I’m starting to feel fatigue. It strikes the perfect balance between accessibility and hardcore simulation, which I feel most simulators don’t hit. Compared to the earlier titles there’s a whole new level of realism, where the aerodynamics and skidding feel just right. When you’re driving on a rainy track and you lose traction, the sensation of sliding on the track is immediately understandable. You can feel how you could have prevented it, and encourages you to do better in the next corner. The way the game communicates what the car is doing to you, even through the imperfect medium of a gamepad, is better than any other racing game I’ve played.\n\nVisually it’s easily one of the best games I’ve ever seen, though this opinions appears controversial from what I’ve seen from other players. Like Alien Isolation the game uses several camera tricks that don’t show up in videos because of compression. Thanks to heavy post-process antialiasing and advanced motion blur there are almost no visible jaggies whatsoever. This makes the game look more like a CG movie than a videogame. There’s a remarkable sense of coherence to the visual style. The cars and the tracks appear to be part of a larger world, and objects far off in the distance have a sense of presence that is unusual in games. It feels huge and convincing. This coherence was clearly a goal of the developers, as they’ve made improvements in pit animations. The transition animations between menus, and when you drive out to the track are all much more polished than before. There’s just a couple jerky movements here and there for the sake of speeding up the pace. I prefer how this looks to Project Cars, and any other racing game out now for that matter. The only comparable game is Driveclub. It makes me feel like I’m there, like it’s a real place, like it’s a part of a bigger world like nothing else I’ve played.\n\nOther details like the audio has been overhauled. Engine sounds aren’t as in-your face as before, as they now sound as if they travel through the air before hitting you. Same with other sounds like the audience, reflections against walls, and tire noises. They’re all filtered differently based on where the camera is placed, none sounding like simplistic game sounds of the past. A new addition is the wind noise which changes based on car aerodynamics. If you damage the front wing, the air audibly travels differently across the car, making quite alarming sounds if it’s heavily damaged. You can hear the role it plays in keeping you on the track, even if you might not understand it on an intellectual level. This is easily the most advanced racing game sound engine I’ve heard, packed with subtleties that help make the long races more interesting.\n\nIf you played any of the other F1 games, and have been waiting that next-gen upgrade before jumping in again, this is it. It doesn’t have as extensive career options as before, but the Championship mode will still take you ~20 hours to run a single season, so it’s mostly a loss for those who are in it for the long haul. I’m fine with how this game turned out. In fact it’s better than I dared hope. The depth of the core game mechanics, the coherence to the visual design, the rich audio design, makes this a no-brainer recommendation. I’ve had no technical issues, and most of the crash bugs other people have reported have already been fixed.","July 9, 2015","true","10.8"," 13 of 29 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","13","29","0","0"

The car physics feel fantastic and the force feedback is great. You can really feel the bumps and speed thanks to the improved soundtrack and new engine which makes it feel and look like a totally different game to F1 2014. Graphics have been greatly improved and I can run it at a smooth 60fps maxed out at 1440p with gtx 780 SLI (Not sure if SLI profile is out yet). The AI feel more challenging on higher difficulties and use the track to how I watch F1 on TV. The new weather conditions look amazing and really change the way you have to drive compared to last years game and most of the tracks look great as well. Stormy weather conditions look photorealistic especially on the Singapor track. I want to mention that there are no safety cars in the game and I have no idea why. Also the hit collision is so bad you can get away with pretty much anything (hopefully a mod will come out to fix that just like F1 2014)\n\nPros: Greatly Improved physics\nGreatly improved graphics (adds immersion especially with the soundtrack ingame)\nRealistic AI\nperformance is good (While I cannot play in 4K as I get around 40fps I am waiting for an SLI profile to fix that and there is a benchmark you can loop to see performance like F1 2014)\nCan choose to race in 2014 cars and season and 2015 cars and season\nAmazing weather conditions (graphically and gameplay wise)\n\ncons: No career mode\nCannot foward time in practice or qualifiying quick enough\nCan be demanding if you have a lower spec machine (Lots of graphics options to tweak though)\nGraphics are great comparing to F1 2014 but not the best compared to the newest racing games like project cars\nMinimal style TV intro with commentary which could have been much more as it lasts for like 10 seconds.\nNo safety cars\nBad hit collision and damage\n\nIf you love F1 games or have an interest in F1 I would recommend this game only if you have a good spec machine, dont mind some of the missing game modes and enjoy racing games.","July 9, 2015","true","15.2"," 19 of 42 people (45%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","45","19","42","4","0"

I've only played Championship Mode and have not attempted online, but so far I am really impressed. Sure there are some bugs and the game is definitely not perfect, but nonetheless, it is very good. The areas where I've had the biggest issues are with the frame rate slowing down at braking points (gets pretty blurry, but only very briefly) and with the AI being fairly aggressive and not seeming to mind trying to get their nose embedded in your rear wing if you so happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. The AI issue doesn't happen all that often and only if you're really in the way, so its not that bad. The final issue is with the flashbacks. I try not to use them, but for anyone just starting out they are a great help. However, in this game they are very hard to use, once you select the place you want to restart at you go so quickly back to the game that it is very hard to control, at high speeds your car and the wall can end up being the same thing if you arent being careful.The last F1 game I had was 2013 and the actual racing compared to that is amazing. The wheel-to-wheel action is great and really presents a challenge. Obviously playing with a wheel helps that, so i cant speak about controller (gamepad) play, but the driving is fantastic. Im using an i5 and gtx 960, and am able to run the game on high settings. Even on high the graphics are, in my opinion, amazing. The slight blur that people have been talking about does exist, but it is hardly noticeable. Even though there are definitely some work and patches needed, I would recommend this game for any fan of racing and F1.","July 13, 2015","true","302.9"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","1","5","0","0"

It needed expanding, not removing completely but I digress.\nThe new podiums feel stiff and awkward partly due to the poor character models.\n\nYou get two seasons worth of content in this package, 2014 + 2015 but a real missed opportunity by Codemasters to tie the two seasons together into some cohesive career mode. Instead you simply pick which seasons cars you chose to drive which other than aesthetics drive exactly the same.\n\nSeason mode has a fixed set of options regarding length and season types that can't be tweaked so if your doing a 25% race distance your forced to do 1 15min practice season and a 1 shot qualifying lap. No option to do a traditional qualifing setup. I can't understand why you would remove played choice from menu's that has been there since 2010.\n\nVisuals are about the norm for the series with a really horrific motion blur and Depth of field effect added to hide the cracks, the much heralded 'new game engine' is clearly just an evolution of the EGO engine. If it isn't, then they've gone very much out of their way to make it exactly the same in many ways. Another missed chance to really upgrade.\n\nEverything else feature wise has had a massive step backwards. A very empty product. They've already confirmed there will be no DLC either so what you see is what you get. Very disappointing.\n\nThe core game underneath has potential....

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tempest0/recommended/286570/","Tempest0","Tempesto","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tempest0/","152 products in account","F1 2015 is the next official game of the F1 season brought to you by Codemasters. Last year they announced that, while still releasing F1 2014 in September as usual, they were just going to port over F1 2013 minus classic cars/tracks and alter the looks of the cars (and that they did). They did this because they were focusing on a brand new current gen F1 game that they were intending to release earlier in the year than usual. That game is F1 2015.\n\nI've now played 2 hours of it and, combined with my experiences playing the official Codemasters F1 games since 2011, I feel I have a fairly decent insight of the game, so I'm going to go with the typical pros cons approach with some elaboration.\n\nSo, without further ado. Lets get started!\n\n\nPros:\n\n+ While F1 2014 just felt like F1 2013 without the need to press the KERS button each lap, this game really overstates the changes that were made to F1 in 2014. Less rear grip, more torque, less fuel, harder tyres, and a reduced front wing width. Combined you can really tell the difference and it feels fantastic!\n\n+ The game is beautiful. You get to see the tracks in full glory at the start of a race session, but the rest of the game (bar the driver models maybe) looks absolutely fantastic. With a pleasing to look at UI too.\n\n+ The game sounds beautiful too. The low pitch roar (lets be honest, it's more like a purr ;) ) of those V6 engines, the whistle of that turbo as it spools up, the sound of the wind rushing past your cockpit, and the squeal of the tyres as your slide them over the curbs. All fantastic.\n\n+ Customisation: While F1 games have always been fairly good in terms of customisation this one takes it to the next level. You can request alterations to wing tilt from the pit box during a race! That added, with the new radio chat (though you can not literally speak to your engineer on PC) you can even announce things like oversteer, loss of traction, and your engineer will suggest a course of action. I feel like Jenson Button already!\n\n+ In my 2 hours of gameplay I've seen the AI drivers make plenty of mistakes. Which, can be annoying, but it makes it all the more interesting. Max Verstappen lost his rear going round a corner when he caught his wheel on the curb, spinning into me. Maldonado locked up on the entrance to a corner and bumped me in the rear. It's always nice to see AI drivers not being super duper computer driver guys.\n\n+ This may seem like a minor point but trust me, it's so good that I feel it needs it's own point. You can finally spectate other drivers whilst in the pits in a quali or practice session! Complete with speed trap speeds and sector speeds. Want to see how your rival takes the track? Now you can!\n\n+ The addition of the pre-race on grid line up, an aerial view of every track introducing a race, podium celebrations, and the UI and features inside the pits, you can definitely see that CM went for a more immersive feel with this game and I must say I really like it. Though, podiums make me a bit sad because no career mode.\n\n+ CM have given us the 2015 season AND the 2014 season to play with making up for that dreadful F1 2014 game. So we get to enjoy 2014 as it was meant to be enjoyed.\n\n+ It's worth noting that I have yet to try multiplayer but I did have a quick look in that section of the menu and it certainly seems there are far more options for matchmaking. Allowing choose skill level of your rivals, as well as picking and choosing various settings and assists to keep the races fair game.\n\n+ Again, CM seem to have got the simulation/arcade balance right. The car and customisation feel good enough to satisfy a hardcore racing simer's needs but the game is completely friendly to a more arcade based user experience. This is something CM have done for the past 4 years and they have continued it on with this game.\n\n\nCons:\n\n- No career mode :(. Personally, one of my biggest enjoyments of F1 games is making my own driver, stepping into a lower team's cockpit and working my way up to become a world champion. Sadly, in this game CM decided to remove that possibility. You can still do a career of sorts as an existing driver but it will only be one season (technically 2 I suppose if you do a 2014 season as say, Vettel, and then play a 2015 season as him too...) I have yet to start one of these though so I can't comment on R&amp;D progression or that sort of thing. Oh well, looks like I won't be winning no races this year as myself.\n\n- Now I can't comment for everyone but so far I've found the game much more favorable to play with a controller (an Xbox One controller to be exact which, due to windows drivers, is effectively an Xbox 360 controller). I think this is mostly down to my wheel's dreadful pedals though. I figured it was worth mentioning because Retrofly seemed to mention it didn't feel right to him with his wheel. But this one is subject to your own experiences.\n\n- Still can't pit manually. Boy I'd love to do that. To make matters worse, when you floor it into the pits (tested at Silverstone) once you cross the pit speed limit line the car instantly decelerates to the pit limiter speed which is very strange to experience. A minor gripe though.\n\n- I can't find an option to turn off or reduce HUD. I generally like to play my F1 games HUD free and the addition of the radio chat enforces my preference, but so far the only way I've noticed how to reduce the HUD is to go into cockpit view, and even then it leaves like current position and lap time at the top. Retrofly said there was an option but I haven't found it.\n\n\nIn summary, this feels like a massive improvement from the previous F1 game, much in the same way F1 2013 felt to F1 2012. And while I'm disappointed in the lack of a career mode it certainly doesn't lack in content giving you the 2014 season for free. Like I said, to me the game feels more friendly using a controller which has really been the same in all F1 games to date from Codemasters, so if you're looking for a race sim to play with your fancy racing wheel I might recommend something like Assetto Corsa. But if you're an F1 fan looking for a quality F1 racing game to play, or even just looking for a decent racing game that isn't a hardcore simulator as such, this game is probably more suited to you.\n\nThanks for reading.","July 9, 2015","true","27.8"," 14 of 32 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","14","32","0","3"

I mean absolutely stunning. I actually feel like I'm strapped into one of these beasts of auto innovation. You feel the raw power of the engine and the tyre wear is a lot more noticeable. Even on a 360 controller. If you're a formula fan and enjoy the previous installments of the franchise, then 2015 is a must. I've put in a full practice session at Melbourne and the track looks absolutely stunning. The engines sound pretty accurate as well.\n\nThe only down side is I'll bet getting it for Xbox One also and probably play more on it since I can use kinect to chat with the race engineer. Not sure why it couldn't be done on PC but I'll leave that to the technical experts at Codemasters to explain(although it's not really needed). One last thing is the speed trap information I noticed they added but I couldn't find my speed, however watching the onboard video of the AI drivers I got a pretty good idea I was fastest through it.\n\nAll in All so far 10/10 glad I bought it and saved $5USD.","July 9, 2015","true","66.4"," 24 of 53 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","24","53","0","0"

The game was very unstable prior to the hotfix (10/07/15) but is since far more stable and I personally haven't experienced any crashes. The optimisation is class; everything maxed out at 1440p and I never drop below 60fps whilst driving (4790k, GTX 970), though I have heard that Crossfire and SLi don't work.\n\nIt is a fun game, but the simulation element when it comes to car handling and feel is absolutely minimal, even more 'arcade' feeling than the previous games. I've tried multiple settings with my wheel (Thrustmaster Ferrari F430) and with my Xbox 360 gamepad but I just don't get the feeling that the tyres and track are connected, it actually takes a lot of effort to put the car into a spin, on purpose without dropping down into first and purposefully doing a donut, the car generally feels like it's floating around the track; I play with all assists off.\n\nThe AI are hit and miss, it seems to vary between practise and qualifying and the actual race; in the actual race, the AI will follow blue flag rules if you're passing some backmarkers, whereas they won't in practise and qualifying. The aggression of the AI has been turned up a notch and it's both good and bad, good because they provide a bit more of a challenge, bad because they'll often just charge straight into you like you're invisible.\n\nSome options are missing, such as career and co-op career. The classic career mode I would have liked to see, moving your way up (or sideways) through different teams as you progress through a career for me, added to the all important immersion. It has instead been replaced with 'Championship season' where you take over a real driver and can't change teams, and 'Pro season' where you're locked into a full race weekend with no assists, parch ferme rules, legend AI, full damage etc...\n\nThe engine sounds are absolutely spot on, the engines sound authentic, but the engineer random babble (he never shuts up!) and the menu music can get annoying.\n\nThe graphics in my opinion are a backwards step overall, the game looks decent, but not as good as previous iterations in this franchise in certain areas, for instance, I haven't experienced any blocky graphics or texture pop-in, but the cars themselves don't look as good, the mirrors have this strange slideshow thing going on, the AO isn't that strong even when set to X16 and it all has this strange blur effect.\n\nAs for multiplayer, I can't comment on it as I'm not interested in it for this particular game.\n\nSo do I reccommend it? Yes and no; it is a fun game, but it is not worth the Steam retail price of £39.99. It would be a fun little pastime to snap up on sale though.","July 11, 2015","true","24.6"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","5","14","0","0"

So please be kind.  haha\n\nThis new version has the  latest season for 2015, new graphics. great camera angles & terrific replays. Obviously never driven an F1` car myself, but the handling feels quite good - you cant just tap the brake & expect to make it through a corner. cars do understeer alot through braking. AI seems really competitive too.   Graphics look less vibrant & cartoony than the previous versions, it has somre sort of filter on it so it looks like you are watching vision from the TV telecast - if that makes sense?\n\nIt is missing career mode, split screen racing.  However it does come with 2014 season as well.  Codemasters will be releasing performance data updates soon to align it with the real season shortly too.\n\nVery enjoyable game so far for over an hour I've played it for.\n\nI think some people maybe put off by the steep min or max PC specs.  I can re-assure everyone this game plays & looks spectacular even on min specs it will run lightning fast even on 1080P.  I had everything running on high to ultra high as a test - & frame rate was still solidly running on min 50fps+\n\nMy specs are entry level Alienware Alpha PC console..\n-- not too hardcare of a  PC.\n\nBase model..\nIntel i3 2.9ghz (dual core)\n8 gigs ram (upgraded from 4gb)\nStandard 5400rpm hdd & GPU provided.\n\nHope this helps in some way.\n\nthanks for reading.

But.. when on track, this is most fun i have had with a codemasters F1 game. The car feels lively, especially under braking, in the wet it is a total handful! I actually need to use my wing mirrors against the AI in this game, they seem much more concious and willing to attack.\n\nBest of all.. in previous games i have felt like i was the only influencing factor in the race, if i didn't cause something to happen, it would be proceedural and finish to the expected result. Rather than action only happening directly around me, the race actually feels alive, overtakes, incidents and mistakes seem to happen around the track.\n\nSome of the previous features are missing, such as career mode.. the line from Codemasters is that people rarely finished career mode and wasn't worth the time, the response from the internet seems to disagree.. but ultimately this is something that they could change post release if they wanted to. And hopefully will.\n\nThe audio in the game is brilliant, the engines sound much better than previous games, (particuarly the Honda)! And your race engineer is much more useful! The little race intros from David Croft (and Ant Davidson i think?) do bring more of an event feel to the race and good for the first time around, but i have already started skipping them.\n\nThe core of the game for me is how the racing feels, and in that category this game is brilliant, their best yet. The missing game modes are garnish, the bugs will be fixed, the racing is what matters. Although this game feels as though it was rushed over the line, it is fun and challenging in a way that none of the previous games have been.\n\nI understand the frustrations of others but i can't enjoy this game as much as i have and give it a negative review.

I also did not expect anything resembling sim-like physics. You can get that in iRacing, don't expect any of that here (or in Project CARS for that matter).\nI expected more emphasis on physics, however, and on car setups, though not too much.\nAlso, I personally do not care for the career mode or anything of that sort. In all of my previous F1 games I played as Mr. Player One with a plain white helmet.\nI also expected a reworked AI. I played Project CARS and AC both, and in both cases I was very disappointed with the AI. Especially in Project CARS' case the AI was far too agressive.\n\nWith that in mind, F1 2015 ticks almost all the boxes in my books. The visuals are solid, though not all that impressive, certainly not as good as Project CARS, but that was to be expected.\nIn terms of actual driving, I was pleasantly surprised with the new physics model. It makes driving challenging, but it leaves you room for mistake, even with no assists on. The flexibility in terms of setups was also better than I expected. You can now change differential settings and there is no arbitrary "ride height" setting, now you change it by altering the suspension settings. For some reason there is no garage setting for brake balance. I am not sure if setup changes actually affect the performance all that much, but so far so good.\nThe AI was by far the biggest improvement in my books. Now it actually tries to defend! AI drivers will at least try to keep their line into the corner, and they are much less prone to sticking to a line which will inevitably lead them into a gravel trap. That being said, they are still remarkably sluggish in the first couple of corners. You can gain a lot of positions there on any difficulty setting.\nThe absence of the safety car is disappointing, but I knew about it beforehand.\nI have encountered a few glitches, most notably when the game would activate all of the assists when I tried to start a Pro Season. Creating a new save file solved that.\nAs for the performance, I was pleasantly surprised here as well. I was a bit worried when I saw the recommended specs, but my laptop can run the game at very steady framerate (>30fps) at medium-high settings. I have an i7 4700MQ @ 2.4GHz, 16GB of RAM and a GeForce GTX765M. Not a slouch, but not a powerhouse either.\nUsing a G27 wheel I did encounter the problem with weak FFB, but changing the wheel settings, both in-game and through Logitech software, fixed that.\n\nI do have a few minor complaints - for example I find the camera angles for looking left and right to be a bit too extreme. Also, I am not sure how to use the new voice commands, and whether they even work on PC. The game did not give me an explanation.\nAdditionally, I have a few complaints about the realism side of things. While I appreciate the attention to detail (for the first time since F1 2011 all of the steering wheels are accurate!), I find it annoying that the game allows you to downshift into neutral and then reverse. Not something that can be done in an actual F1 car, mind you. Also, the Pro Mode is made unnecessarily difficult by the fact that very little race info is displayed on your steering wheel. Things like sector times, lap deltas, fuel levels, brake bias, and so on, stuff that even the most basic racing displays should have, are only accessible through your race engineer, who, at least for me, is only accessible through the convoluted new system that I don't quite understand.\nThe damage model did improve as well - the front wing is a lot more fragile, and the crashes look somewhat more realistic. A lot of people ask for a more spectacular damage model, but Codemasters can’t add it because of the restrictions of the F1 game licence.\n\ntl;dr\nOf course this game isn't perfect, but I will go as far as to say that this is perhaps the best F1 game since F1 2010. There are some off-putting points about this game (such as the lack of a safety car), but on the whole I think that this is a very solid release, and I am glad to see the series moving in the right direction.\nPeople have been reporting a plethora of glitches, but I've only experienced the one which left the assists on during the Pro Season, and even that is easily fixable. As is the case with a lot of PC games these days, the stability may be hit or miss, but I have not experienced a single crash or major slowdowns of any sort.","July 10, 2015","true","8.1"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","30","3","10","0","0"

They don't give up as easilly anymore. However they still go double file into the first corner on race starts which is completely bonkers and unrealistic. They are generally more competitive, however they still take some corners unrealistically slow or fast which is a real bummer.\n\n- Controls\n\nIt's fine with a 360 controller, infact its very playable. Came 3rd as Raikonnen with no assists against expert AI in my first race. However, when first starting the game it couldn't recognize what i was using for acceleration. I had to go into control setup and rebind everything on my gamepad to make it work. Also there are no deadzone settings within the game (they do exist in XML files though) and the gamepad deadzone is way too small making going in a straight line quite scary.\n\n-  Gameplay\n\nIt plays like the previous games, there really isn't a big difference. People who claim this to be anywhere near a sim have no idea what they are talking about. This is still extremely arcade and handholdy in nature, and thats ok for what it is. If you want a sim go play iracing, AC or RF2, this is a "realistic" game. The only real improvement to the "physics" and i use that term very loosely, is that it's not as frustrating as the previous years because you have a tiny bit more control.\n\nNo career mode and i don't care. It has seasons (2014 and 2015) single race and time trial. I'm totally fine with that, i'd rather drive as Alonso or Vettel than as myself, seeing my real name in game was always extremely jarring.\n\n- Graphics\n\nKinda rubbish, atleast for the requriements that are recommended. The AA implementation is terrible, its a blurry mess. You can turn off the motion blur in an XML file (again why is this not an ingame option?) but there is some seroiusly weird upscaling going on or something because the game looks bad, its like it runs natively at 720p. Also some serious LOD happening as things in the distance don't appear sharp until you are really close, not particularly good for a game when you are doing 200kmh/+ and a object hasn't loaded.\n\n- Final verdict\n\nIt's a good game at its core. The racing is more enjoyable than previous F1 games and there is some potential here. But its buggy as hell, it crashes, controls don't always work and the graphics are extremely sub par for a PC racing game. Yet i'm still going to recommend this game, but only if you are prepared to deal with bugs. Otherwise wait a month or two and pick it up, hopefully by then Codemasters will have fixed it up.","July 11, 2015","true","8.9"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","30","3","10","0","0"

It's rare you're hooked in by that, the TV-like coverage, camera placements are spot on.\n\nNegatives -\n- Lack of 2015 career mode is a negative, no ways about it. It feels like a downgrade from previous years. Like the mode has been sacrificed to get the game out earlier this season.\n- 2/2 times loaded and booted from online races at startup. May just be me.\n- The odd random glitch graphically. ex. A wheel visually flickering for half a lap.\n- Steam Trading Cards yet to drop.\n\n\nFor me.

The AI have also been updated, making for a much more challenging experience at the harder difficulties, while keeping it appropriately scaled for those who are new to the game and playing on easier difficulties. The graphics have also been updated and while they aren't a huge part in racing games, it's hard to not notice them when they look this good.\n\nMultiplayer has been changed somewhat with more 'preset' lobbies to search in and you can now compete in races or lap around a circuit in time trial while waiting to find/join a game, which is a great addition. However, the multiplayer is region locked as far as I can tell which is somewhat annoying.\n\nCareer mode has been removed and replaced with a "championship season" mode. It's the same thing except you play as a real life driver rather than having your name on the screen. Some people seem to care about this, some even not buying because of this but to me it's not a big deal. Personally, I'd rather race as Ricciardo or Hulkenberg than replace them and race against their team mate. Split Screen co-op has also been removed but isn't really something that was important to me.\n\nSome people are reporting various bugs but personally I've only had minor issues with my G27 settings and having to reset them every time I launch the game. A minor thing really but I expect that will get patched relatively quickly.\n\nAs someone who has bought many previous itterations of the F1 game series, I feel that this year, the changes are significant enough to warrant a purchase if you're unsure about buying the game, because it really is a new game you're getting, not just v1.2 of the previous year's game like it sometimes felt.","July 12, 2015","true","68.2"," 9 of 23 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","9","23","0","0"

I'm sim racer from head to toes and sims like rFactor and iRacing are the thing.\n\nI can't really even believe that I own every F1 CM from 2010 to 2015 now. Here's my opinions about previous titles:\n2010 was ok, didn't even own a wheel back then.\n2011 is most likely the best one for me, but it had lots of bugs, mainly save corruptions.\n2012 is definately the worst ever, the handling was über clunky and it just had very frustrating feel for me.\n2013 was close to 2011's feel. Solid sim-ish-cade racer.\n2014 was obviously something different as engines changed to V6's (like it does matter in game vs irl, duh). Overall feel was quite good, but lot of the time it felt like the tire spinning was really artificial.\nWell this game, I was told by another sim racer that it is surprisingly very good. So I took the risk and gave it a go. For me as in, does it even work? No problems at all, which surprises me a lot. FPS is around 70-80 with high settings, so no optimization issues atleast on my side. Handling is really good, shockingly good, and for the first time you don't need to fart around with the wheel settings to have it at 270 degrees, to be able to drive even close to like normal human being. I'm using 450 degrees, feels great, but I might change it to match the ingame wheel (somewhere around 540 degrees). The wheel i'm using is Logitech G27.\n\nRacing against the A.I is really fun. Some people have said that the A.I just runs on them and crash them out. After few races I've had, if we collide, the case has usually been that I haven't given enough room to the guy next to me and then lost control of my back end, when my back and his nose have contacted. I've been driving on legendary difficulty, it could be even harder but it's ok. Don't know about the lower difficulties, but they go quite aggressively for the overtakes and if you left space too much in to the corner, they go for it if they close enough. I had few chills when I was driving behind Williams in Ferrari, I just couldn't catch in the straights enough to go for the overtake and this happened many laps, is this season 2015 or what?\n\nSo racing itself, bloody awesome. But there's problems too.\n\nFirstly graphics. Their ok, nothing that explodes your consciousness, but there are few things I want to point out:\nMotion blur - feels like the games wants you to look at your cars nose. Everything in the distance (where you should look at) are too blurry. It makes me feel like I'm going crosseyed. In the pause menu you can see everything coming more tidy.\nShaking - this and blur makes it even worse, I'm not saying it horrible, but those things shoudn't exist, atleast there should be an option to change these.\nSteering wheel bugs - when you change your view, firstly it centers your wheel and secondly, doesn't respond for a little while. It's not big of a problem though if you're driving with same view all the time.\nGraphical bugs - In chase cam, my left rear tire is flickering, and sometimes in cockpit view the wheel starts to do it's own screen tearing looking party. There are many others, but I'm lazy and I just want to end this damn review.So overall very very good, but if you planning to buy it, play safe. Wait through the possible patches.","July 12, 2015","true","14.0"," 5 of 15 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","5","15","2","0"

Finally we see independent temp and wear stats for individual tyres for example and at last it feels like your driving style an dpit strategy choices have a gebuine effect. (I will update this review when I have a better feel for tyre changeover dry to wet). The physics model seems much improved, as ever the game is very well optimised and I've not been encountering many of the bugs others have drawn attention to - agin though your mileage may vary. As with any racing game, if changes effect driver performance negatively, that inclines people towards slating the game so do bear that in mind when wading through reviews - the same applies to mine which is written after discovering that the reworked physics and handling suit me very well.\n\nThe reworked race engineer is an excellent addition, giving genuinely helpful insight and data when you need it. The dynamic weather and track evolution works great also - this is easily my favourite game in the series to date.\n\nHowever, there are some cons. Firstly, the UI can be more than a little frustrating and driver AI seems to have gone backwards against last year, with drivers being often reckless an dunyielding even on out or in laps. The broadcast style commentary is a great touch but sadly it's badly delivered and doesn't seem authentic somehow.\n\nStill no ability to design your own helmet or pick your own race number, which seems to me to be a set of features that would require minimal work to implement. Would love to see a custom driver profile and have elements of that reflected in Crofty's commentary.\n\nThe lack of career mode and safety car are bigger issues and a surprising sacrifice for codies to make, however it's not impossible for these to be implemented later. This doesn't excuse the oversight however. The inclusion of the 2014 season was a nice touch and I think we're all glad Manor made it into the game for release.\n\nIn summary, I would definitely recommend. However bear in mind it may take a few patches to resolve some of the issues others are encountering so it's hard to be totally effusive wit my recommendation. In any case, the series is moving in the right direction and this is to be appluaded. The game veers more towards sim and less arcade when compared to the previous titles and if that's your bag, you'll be well catered to.","July 10, 2015","true","38.2"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","31","4","13","2","0"

If you're a fan of F1, and want to drive F1 cars, then this is for you (if you have a decent FFB wheel). If youre looking for a game with lots of gimmicks, like reading emails and changing teams, then one of the predecessors will be better for you.\n\nYes, it has bugs, and yes it does feel kind of featureless compared to its predecessors, but right now, none of that matters to me. Hopefully bugs will be fixed, and no doubt the sequels with have more features.\n\nBut the reason i'm praising Codie's is the driving; No, its not Assetto Corsa, but its a hell of a lot closer to it than the absolute shambles of F12014!\n\nDespite being perhaps slightly 'easy', ie. unrealistic amounts of grip, the driving is generally very intuitive, and natural for anyone who has played AC or any other Sim. Unlike 2014, where the physics just felt horrible, with oversteer feeling scripted, and far from natural, i find myself driving just as i do in AC, playing with the throttle for slight oversteerm, lifting off to the the fronts to bite, etc.\n\nAnd the FFB is 100x better too, where i actually know with the cars doing! I can catch drifts now! Its not just complete guesswork as in 2014. I do feel it lacking in feedback for the first 20-30 degrees, and its lacks any sort of 'bite', but its miles better than before and completely playable and enjoyable.\n\nWhat would i change? Well not much, maybe continue on the road to creating proper feeling and driving cars, which they've pretty much done, they just need to add a touch of realism, especiialy for the 'Pro' mode; Less grip, really feels like TC is on when its off, should be able to spin up the rears more, and lock the brakes too.\n\nAnother thing i would add is a virtual mirror at the top of the screen in Pro mode, since the wing mirrors are useless! And also some more info on the steering wheel screen, such as laps left, delta, gaps to players, tyre temps, especially since you cant get that info from the engineer on PC, and there's no HUD.","July 11, 2015","true","41.0"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","27","3","11","0","0"

After reading some before I launched the game I was thinking, oh ♥♥♥♥, not another Arkham Knight!\n\nCodemasters claim the game was built from the ground up, which usually spells disaster. I remember how Tony Hawk's Project 8 pretty much buried the series with its dreadful mechanics.\n\nThat being said, it's a much needed change for this series which has stagnated over the past couple of iterations. The handling is easier to understand and far less twitchy. Overall presentation appears better, too. Definitely a step in the right direction.\n\nThe performance is decent, getting 80-110FPS on my GTX 970 with all settings at max @ 1080p.\n\nThere are some cons though.\n\n1 Blurry graphics at times, gives me the urge to wipe my glasses even though they're clean. This extends to granular detail on things that are seemingly not there or out of focus compared to the old versions.\n2 AI seem to enjoy doing PIT maneuvers on you, causing YOU to get the penalty.\n3 No safety car!\n4 No career mode\n5 Game crashes on exit\n\nThose saying it's the worst game in the series clearly haven't played F1 '98 or any of Sony's PS2 'efforts'.\n\nI hope for next year we can get an F1 Challenge 99-02 style game with multiple seasons that Codemasters have the rights to through a career mode.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tzukasa7/recommended/286570/","tzukasa7","Tzukasa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tzukasa7/","194 products in account","This is By Far the best F1 game to date as the AI aggressiveness, car handling, braking, weight shifting/balance, and traction have been improved by a factor of 10, at least. The FFB for wheel controllers is much better than any previous F1 game as well, which is good cause for a racing sim you really need a wheel controller (if you don't have a wheel I mean why even bother with a racing sim game?). It probably will require some fine tuning in the settings for dead zone, linarity ect. more than the previous games did but once you get it right the difference is night and day.\n\nJust make sure your wheel is supported on the site first. Also make sure you have the hardware, it Requires windows 64bit version and is a fully next gen game so if your rig doesn't meet or exceed the next gen consoles you might have performance issues. But if you do have a rig that's as good as a ps4 or xbone the performance, in my 100+ hour experiance, with an i7 and gtx780ti it's rock solid 60fps @ 1080 running ultra settings with vsync.\n\nThe major bugs have been squashed and only a few minor ones are left, nothing game breaking really. Though the multiplayer is really lacking and poorly done, the single player is solid. Really the only thing lacking in single player is the career mode is now a single 19 race season where you pick to drive as one of the real life drivers rather than create your own driver. Thus at the end of the season now you either have to pick the same driver and go again, or pick a different driver, rather than in the other games at the end of the season you'd get contract offers to switch teams. Really this is a minor thing and certainly shouldn't keep you from playing as every single other aspect has been improved so very much it makes the older games look like pale imitations.\n\nHaving played '13 & '14 here on steam the difference in simulation of the car is a generational shift. I can't properly express just how much better it is. The graphics are simply beautiful. Going back and playing '13 made my literally laugh at how poorly detailed it was. It looked like a ps2 game in compairision. It was also missing the proper scale that 2015 as well as the minor bumps and character that the tracks have which are present in the 2015 game. If it wasn't for the classic tracks and cars in '13 there would be zero reason for me to ever go back and play it.\n\nAll in all this game truly is the most immersive, graphically beautiful, and realistic F1 to date. Highly recommend to racing and F1 fans for singleplayer. If you want multiplayer, well don't look to any F1 game they are all dead in that area heh.","November 28, 2015","true","196.1"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

Actually, yes it does. It has a few issues at launch but none that are gamebreaking. Nothing like we had with Watch Dogs. Nothing like Assassins Creed Unity. And most certainly nothing like we had with Batman.\n\nI'm running an AMD FX-8350 processor with 32GB of RAM and with an AMD Radeon HD 7990 graphics card and this is the first "new" game in quite a while that I could play without any major optimisation problems. Kudos to Codemasters all round, seems that they released a game in 2015 that works at launch with an AMD card. Who would have thoiught, eh?\n\nThe positives for this game are:\n+ The graphics are great, really improved on previous years titles.\n+ The optimization is spot on, even works flawlessly with an AMD card!\n+ The car handling is exceptional this year. I use a XBox 360 Controller for Windows and the handling is perfect.\n+ The AI are really aggressive this year and will go for that pass!\n+ The option to talk to your pit engineer mid-session to ask about the current pit strategy, tyre wear, weather forecast etc is a very welcome addition and one I find myself taking advantage of quite a lot!\n+ Championship Season - pick your favourite team and driver and go! I always wanted this to exist alongside the much acclaimed Career mode of previous games. Now it's finally included, At last, I can race as my favourite team and driver!\n+ The broadcast presentation is quite good - not perfect but it's still nice to see it included.\n+ Podium celebrations!\n+ Both 2014 and 2015 seasons included.\n+ Pro-Season mode for the more hardcore F1 racer!\n\nAnd now the negatives:\n- I am finding some minor graphical glitches in the game, most notably tyres on cars flickering between visible and invisible (showing just the rim) and people on the grid having this same issue during the broadcast presentation sections before a race starts.\n- The "Run Benchmark" mode worked only on the 5th attempt. All other attempts led to the game exiting back to my desktop for no reason as soon as the benchmark test was completed.\n- No Career mode this year is a bit of a disappointment, even if the rest of what's here is rock solid.\n- No Online Co-op championship (maybe next year, eh?).\n- Lack of any kind of a safety car is a bit puzzling. Not a gamebreaker, though, just something I think we all expected to see in the game.\n\nOverall, though, this is a game that I am already having so much fun with. What's here is excellent. If you can see past the lack of the Career mode (which is the biggest and most notable absentee) you will find a great looking, challenging and fun F1 game with both 2014 and 2015 seasons included.\n\nI love this game and would strongly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of F1 and, especially, if you have been a fan of the previous games.

Championship Season and Pro Season modes are fun, however I question the overall longevity of the game, as the game lacks any sort of career mode, where you create your own driver, working your way up from the lower teams to the top, as included in previous F1 games. I feel that all F1 games should have such a mode as this was the main part of the game that I had played in previous iterations, and the decision to leave out such a mode is one thatI cannot comprehend, playing as the real drivers just isnt the same. This left me at first, dissatisfied with my purchase of the game however, after a few laps in a few of the different cars I realised that I could still have fun with the game.. I just miss the career... and even the paddock style menu and other immersive features, that F1 2010 had... 5 years ago...\n\nHowever, aside from that... the inclusion of the drivers and cars from both the 2014, and 2015 seasons is one I feel that the devs must be commended for. This added so much more to the game for me and I appreciate that they have taken the time to add last years teams, drivers and cars. My only major complaint with the game is no career mode. Heres hoping they add it back in F1 2016.","July 9, 2015","true","5.8"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","3","12","0","0"

If you're a fan of F1 then 2015 your bag, it's very organic and nail bitingly intense. Like when me and my team made a bad pit call and I had to fight off the cars on slicks comming from behind me while running Inters on a dry track, nerve racking. Its the first F1 game that worked for me, I don't think its worth $60 but when it drops to $30 soon, I'd call it a nessesity.","July 10, 2015","true","114.4"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","2","10","0","0"

I can't describe it in any other way than brilliant. Everything about this game is spot on. The graphics are fantastic, the handling is outstanding, the sounds are brilliant, the force feedback system is perfect (project cars level), the broadcast presentations at the beggining of each session is awesome and the engineer is helpful for once! This game is just amazing and really shows what codemasters can do. I would massively recommend this game to anyone. Ecspecially if you race with a wheel like me. Yes this game has quite a lot of glitches and the multiplayer is aweful. But, you have to give it time since it's been out they have been working on fixing these bugs and have already come out with two patches since it's release. So I don't see why people are complaining. I have read a lot of reviews saying that they have taken too much away from the game. All I can say to that is that you clearly don't play the game. They have added so much into this game. Yes they have taken away classic cars and scinario mode and even career mode but most of them were pointless anyway. Classic car mode was pointless as the cars handled virtually exactly the same as the 2013 cars just with different textures and sounds. Scinario mode was rubbish and boring and career mode is basically still there you just can't drive as yourself. Anyway they have added a lot more than they have taken away. For a start this is just a base game for future F1 games to come so give it time. Secondly they have added things like: Talking to your engineer, Pro season mode, podiums at the end of races, tyre blankets, grid overview at the start of races, broadcast presentaion by David Croft and Antony Davidson, 2014 season included when you buy the game not DLC, new enhanced AI that provide a fantastic challenge throughout a weekend (watch videos if you don't believe me), tweaking front wing in pit stops, new fun animation (when pulled into the pits etc.) and a brand new replay system with real world camera angles. Basically there is a lot in this game certainly a lot more than in previous games. Remember this game is like F1 2010 in the sense that it is a base model for future games to come. This game has been built completely from scratch and has the potential of being the best racing sim out there. In my opinion this game beats Project Cars and Assetto Corsa, not only because you're racing new up-to-date F1 cars but in many other ways such as: much better AI, handling model, graphics and force feedback. So if you're thinking 'should I buy this game?' my answer would be 1000000% yes! because it is fantastic. Just give it time and all the bugs will be gone.","July 19, 2015","true","110.8"," 1 of 11 people (9%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","9","1","11","6","4"

Now that I played it, I would say that it is worth the 60 dollars if you manage to get it to WORK. On my cut price PC with only a gtx 670, 8gb of ram and a middle range quad core i7 (3990 or something like that) I have had NO FLAWS... yes I am telling the truth, NO FLAWS. I have enjoyed every minute of my 6 hours in game. The reason why I am giving it the thumbs down is not because of the blurriness or because of the lack of features, but because for most people it is unplayable. I am the only one in a f1 gaming group of 30 people who has been able to play this game for more than 5 minutes at a time. ALL of my friends have had CONSTANT crashes, fps drops, controller issues etc. *just note that their PC's are gaming built high spec machines*. The majority of people that have purchased this game are having issues with it. Don't get me wrong its a great game, but for 60 dollars its more of a gamble. If you want to take that risk, get the funds, click that purchase button. If it works, you will have a lot of fun. Otherwise, trust the steam refund\n\n\nI reccomend that you wait until Codies gets their act together and patches this game\n\nEDIT: New Patch on July 31st removes some major issues with the game. You can now customize your "career mode" and your engine will no longer sponateously combust while exitting pit lane. I don't know about the FPS drops, but at the moment, on my system, I reccomend this game","July 12, 2015","true","89.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","4"

Championship season is where you have one season with one of the real F1 drivers and only that one season to win the Championship)\n\nThere are this thing that annoy me it that you have three options A short race weekend witch is Short Practice One-Shot qualifying and a 25% race. and then a Normal race weekend i think it is where you get a normal Practice session a short qualifying and a 50% race and then Long race weekend witch is just the realistic with 100% race and full Practice and so on. What annoys me is that you cant choose f.eks. A 25% race normal Practice and Short Qualyfying witch you could do in F1 2014 you are just locked to the weekends they gave you.\n\nHeres a big plus the AI they have been improved a hell of a lot and are trying to overtake and have different strategys each one. The handeling has been improved too and it just feels a hell of a lot smoother goling through corners than last year and all the other F1 games.\n\nBut i ♥♥♥♥ing hate that there is no safety cars that just screws you over most of the time.\n\nBut all in all Codemasters did a good job of creating this game obviously they need to improve a hell of a lot on F1 2016 to make the F1 franchise get big because this game lacks a lot but i like it and would say thet if you are and F1 fan buy this game.\n\nHope you find this usefull\n\nSincerly, Oliver","July 27, 2015","true","20.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I understand that you might not want to play as one of the real drivers but instead as yourself, but that experience was lacking. You didn't have a name that your engineer could say when talking to you, only nicknames or some common english names.\n\nMultiplayer has always been bad across all the F1 games made by Codemasters, so what did you expect on day 1 after game release? On F1 2013 I couldn't find lobbies at all, in F1 2014 I didn't bother to try the online. I've seen F1 2015 live streams, and the multiplayer needs some patching, but I have tried it once, and you know what? It worked fine for me. I could race close to other people, no problem. One of the problems are people with  bad internet connections, so don't blame it all on Codemasters.\n\nI have enjoyed Career mode so far, and yes I would like to call it career mode. The only difference is that you drive as one of the real drivers for one season, so get over it. I would recommend this game, but you do need a somewhat good PC. Average FPS: 30 (actually less after a patch that was released same day as writing this) with a Nvidia GTX 550 Ti on low settings. I know its a old PC, but optimizing the game would be a huge improvement.\n\nShould you buy it?\nIf you're a cry baby or just like to blame game designers: just no, stay away, please.\nIf not, I think so. Career mode is really fun, with a much better AI compared to F1 2013 and F1 2014. They actually fight you and will try to pass you on corners, unlike older F1 games where they would back off.\n\nEDIT 03/11/2015: As I mentioned earlier in this review: a patch was released and my average FPS was worse after that. The gaming PC I use 95% of the time is kinda outdated (NVIDIA GTX 550 Ti GPU). I Have not played the game in a long time, but I have not heard about any updates that really improves the game. So if you're playing the game on an older gaming PC, I would not recommend this game at all, as I got an average FPS of just below 30 at the lowest possible settings.\n\nBut as long as you got a decent PC then this is so much better than the previous F1 games by Codemasters. As I also mentioned: the AI fights back, where as in F1 2013 for example, they just didn't bother fighting you if you pass them.\n\nEDIT 28/11/2015: This game is much better than older F1 games when it comes to AI, and I really like this game, IF it would run better. Terrible optimized as mentioned before. When they recommend a GTX 970 something is wrong. GTX 970 is a quite high end GPU, and a racing game does for example not have a huge open world to load, and physics arent as good/advanced as lets say rFactor 2, so in theory no need for a GTX 970 GPU if they just spent a little bit more work on optimizing the game. If they had just done that, then I would recommend this game.","July 14, 2015","false","19.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

I was disappointed before, but after the latest update i have decided to try it out and i am much happier. The car is tricky to drive which i like, but from racing for last place, im suddenly in contention for being the fastest out there. The AI are much better. I am still struggling with finding the correct setup for my wheel, but that is minor compared to what it was like before. The throttle responds much better too, allowing me to balance out of the corners. I have been avoiding the game the past few weeks, but now I can sit down and work on improving my balance as it is finally working properly. It just needs focus, which I love. I hope they keep improving.\n\nThe camera work in the replays are excellent. No longer fixed camera points at areas around the circuit, it switches to different angles throughout. One lap it will show trackside, next lap it will switch to a helicopter view at the same corner, just like watching live races. I love it\n\nI also love that for the first time since 2011, all 3 practice sessions are available as an option.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/interpleb/recommended/286570/","interpleb","andr3wpr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/interpleb/","383 products in account","I have only played the game for a couple of hours, but feel I have played enough to give some kind of valid opinion. Note this is only based on the single player game as I don't generally play multiplayer.\n\nThe last F1 game I played was F1 2013, which was ok, but had a lot of flaws, in particular that the cars were unrealistically hard to drive. Since then I have got more into racing sims, Project Cars in particular, but Project Cars only has a few of the F1 tracks and as I like to watch F1, I wanted an updated F1 game that had all the tracks. I am not a hardcore sim player, but I find driving the tracks before I watch an F1 race weekend helps with the appreciation of the sport.\n\nThe graphics in F1 2015 are a nice upgrade over 2013, but I have a high end PC and it looks like Project Cars on mid-high settings. I went into the settings expecting to be able to improve a few things, but everything is maxxed out, so it feels slightly dated. They are perfectly acceptable to play though. The only thing that doesn't seem smooth is the animations of the other cars on track, which seem a bit jerky.\n\nThe physics and car handling are much improved over 2013, I drive with traction control on and have no major issues keeping the car on the track as opposed to 2013 that wanted to spin at every opportunity.\n\nThe AI of the other cars is better than 2013 and they do a reasonable job. It is just let down by some of the behind the scenes decisions the game makes, like if an AI car rear ends you, you are the one that gets a penalty. When I was on the last lap of a race (near the back - am still learning!), Rosberg won the race about a lap ahead of me and was soon on my tail racing me like it was for position while I was trying to catch a back marker.\n\nControls, I use a G27 wheel and it was detected and worked ok once I unplugged my X55 joystick which it doesn't like. Force feedback is a bit minimalistic, and a big downgrade from 2013 which was the best FF implementation I have found in a game. It doesn't give much feedback from the track, and collisions with other cars gives more of a constant rumble while you are in contact, it feels like a console FFB scheme ported over to a wheel, which feels cheap.\n\nWhile the presentation of the game is quite slick and has more of a TV style than 2013, some of the UI options are baffling, including the use of F8 to do something standard, but by my wheel setup I only have a mini keyboard where F8 isn't simple to press. If you are doing qualifying, you can't come in to pits and say I'm done, you only have option to accelerate time which is only about 8x.\n\nA baffling omission is lack of KERS, although it does have DRS.\n\nOverall this is a long way from a perfect F1 game (as usual for Codemasters), but it is the best one out there and there is a lot to enjoy for an F1/racing fan. For general racing, I still much prefer Project Cars, but when I want my F1 fix, this satisfies my needs.","December 30, 2015","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

I  bought F1 2015 on sale on sale over the weekend. I have to say appart from some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ emmersion braking graphical anomolies the graphics are very realistic. Different yet on a par with Project Cars at least in dry sunny conditions. The game play is great again on a par with Project Cars Formula A. However, this game was clearly made for console and then ported to PC. I don't mind the cut scenes. They are far better then they used to be in F1 2010! However the menu system is not to put to fine a point on it "♥♥♥♥♥". I this respect Project Cars leaves codemasters in the dust. Its definitly worth the buy at the sale price! You are getting the official F1 Game with all the cars and all the tracks. In Project Cars Formula A you get a kind of fantasy F1 expereince with some of the tracks and a comparable driving experience. But you also get a whole lot ( an awful lot) more. Bottom line I paid about $20 for it and it took getting it for free for a couple of days to persuade me to make the purchase. If I had paid full price of for it ( and a seasoned old fart gamer like me nver does) I would have been disappointed. Codemasters got complacent with being the ruler of the rost in driving games. Now they have been caught with their pants down. The developers of Project Cars in my opinion should be given the privalege of making the official F1 game. Steam should really give the option for a neutral response to their question "Do you recommend this game?" If they did thats what I would have picked. Instead I give this game 2 out of 10 for everything but the graphics and game play. For the graphics and game play I give it 8.5 out of 10. where it not of the emmersion braking graphical anomolies I would give the graphics 9.5 out of 10","March 22","true","29.7"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

The talk with the two pundit (David croft, etc) is a great at the start of the game but after a while it gets old and boring. The AI are stupid as hell when it come to racing online and both (online and off) when over lapping and the physis are bad as a crash on the left hand ide of the car with make the right tyre shot off.

not in this game.\n-crashes at all? not in this game. all u get is some particle flying arround, or maybe it's a fly i picked up from my helmet.\n-mistakes by the ai drivers? not in this game.\n\n-the only really cool 3 things r, at least imo - car models r really nice and the shiny tires like u see it on tv at the t-cam position.\n-the other cool thing is, u have more to look arround while pitting. such as information about coming up weathers - 10 min intervals, really nice. and also u can watch the other drivers while pitting, change camera position and stuff - thats a feature we had already in the 90's at formula one games on psx and i couldn't understand, why the heck they removed it.\n-also the feeling while driving is good. less arcade, more "realistic". as far as i can say that as a non f1 driver..\n\nfor fans, who just want to make some races and like the atmosphere, u can buy it.\nfor all others, like me who want mods to make this game REALLY enjoyable, don't buy it.\n\ngo get urself f1 2012, 13 or 14 and mod it. u will have alot of fun.","March 18","true","12.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I  bought F1 2015 on sale on sale over the weekend. I have to say appart from some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ emmersion braking graphical anomolies the graphics are very realistic. Different yet on a par with Project Cars at least in dry sunny conditions. The game play is great again on a par with Project Cars Formula A. However, this game was clearly made for console and then ported to PC. I don't mind the cut scenes. They are far better then they used to be in F1 2010! However the menu system is not to put to fine a point on it "♥♥♥♥♥". I this respect Project Cars leaves codemasters in the dust. Its definitly worth the buy at the sale price! You are getting the official F1 Game with all the cars and all the tracks. In Project Cars Formula A you get a kind of fantasy F1 expereince with some of the tracks and a comparable driving experience. But you also get a whole lot ( an awful lot) more. Bottom line I paid about $20 for it and it took getting it for free for a couple of days to persuade me to make the purchase. If I had paid full price of for it ( and a seasoned old fart gamer like me nver does) I would have been disappointed. Codemasters got complacent with being the ruler of the rost in driving games. Now they have been caught with their pants down. The developers of Project Cars in my opinion should be given the privalege of making the official F1 game. Steam should really give the option for a neutral response to their question "Do you recommend this game?" If they did thats what I would have picked. Instead I give this game 2 out of 10 for everything but the graphics and game play. For the graphics and game play I give it 8.5 out of 10. where it not of the emmersion braking graphical anomolies I would give the graphics 9.5 out of 10","March 22","true","29.7"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
