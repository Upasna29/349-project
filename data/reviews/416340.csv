I'm happy with my purchase. It's not a smash hit, but I think it's very well done.\n\nThe best way I can describe this game would be as a Settlers clone. For anyone who is a fan of Time-Management and/or Strategy Games, Viking Saga: New World will be an instant classic for you.\n\nI found the artwork simple, but defined. The cut scene animations blended perfectly with the artwork and the voice narration gives you the chance to admire this instead of making you read subtitles. The soundtrack was relaxing and didn't get in the way of the voice and sound effects during gameplay.\n\nDespite sometimes miss-clicking structures or gatherables while aiming for something else, the gameplay was satisfying. At times I would get frustrated and deside the fog-of-war overlay was crap because I couldn't see through it or the cost to clear rubble or repair a bridge was too high and life for these vikings was just unfair!... But truth is, I like the challenge!\n\nI found the goals for the levels were extremely well balanced (at least so far) and it would appear alot of effort has gone into ensuring that this game isn't just a push over. If you're after that perfect 3-star score every time, keep your eyes pealed. I found some new ideas thrown into the mix that I haven't found in other games of the genre. I won't give any spoilers as to what those are though. I think if you're into stuff like Build-A-Lot or Cake Mania, ditch Big Fish Games and get this instead!\n\nAt the end of the day, I think the price was well earned and worth it. Good job.","November 7, 2015","true","20.0"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","1"

Frankly the story isn't at all interesting, but that's not why you'd buy this anyway.\n\nYour workers don't work quite fast enough, and this gets tedious fairly quickly. Even with six running around, because of the various obstacles a lot of actions queue up.\n\nThe voices are really annoying and there's a bug with the option to disable them; it doesn't always work, either at all or from one mission to the next.\n\nThese are minor complaints really, and for the price and the apparent length of the game, I'd still recommend it. 3/5","November 16, 2015","true","9.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
