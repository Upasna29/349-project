However, I don't think it's a game for mass audiences.\n\nThe key aspect of LoA is that it is a STRATEGY game in the truest sense. Not strategy a la real-time-strategy games that in reality emphasize tactics over strategy, this game is about coming up with a grand overarching plan, sticking to it when it's working, modifying it when it's not, and coming up with new ones when your old plan gets blown out of the water.\n\nCombat is very simple: Two armies meet, time passes, and people die. The victor is determined purely through strategic-level elements: How many troops are on each side of the field, how rested those troops are, how good those troops are, and what magic influences the field. I appreciate the change of pace.\n\nOne reason people might want to not buy LoA is that there's only one real campaign right now (plus a tiny tutorial campaign which doesn't count) and it doesn't seem like there's much replay value after you beat that campaign, and once you understand everything the campaign's not that difficult. I beat it on my second or third "real" try (not counting early plays where I didn't know what was going on, some experimental plays where I was intentionally doing "stupid" things in order to learn new tricks, etc) on the medium difficulty.","July 6, 2014","true","11.9"," 64 of 69 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","64","69","0","0"

Legons of Ashworld is a very promising strategy game in the strictest sense. Facing an overbearing foe, you must pick your fights wisely, manage your reasources tightly, and play the game of intrigue to gather the banners of nobles to survive and (hopefully) take the fight to the invading empire. I feel as though its simple resource system, few unit types and actions which can be  easily mistaken for a lack content. Once in the campaign, I didn't find these streamlined elements to be a bother as I found myself playing the overarching game of planning and suriving the intial assualt.

Characters have no real background other than a name and a race. No character traits that made them more or less likely to recruit others, as in Doomdark's Revenge.\n\nIt just feels flat, uninteresting, and leaves me with no real motivation to see the war through. The first person view makes wargaming finicky and require far more clicks and actions than it would have otherwise taken. Without the charm of exploring a world full of unique characters, why bother?","July 4, 2014","false","0.7"," 82 of 118 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","82","118","0","0"

It is a very hard and challenging game. Think about USSR at -41 when Germany assaulted it. Soviets struggled in defensive war at start, until tides turned. Thats what is going on here as well.\n\nAt start your mission is unity "allies" under the same flag. While doing that, you need to defend land against hostitle and superior force. Slowly you gain power by recruiting more cities under your control and winning battles (hopefully). The game has good re-playability possibilities as there are different ways to achieve these things. For example, if you recruit a powerful king on your side, it will end up to a side quest. Which takes your attention elsewhere, while you are already busy by defending your territory. You also have few wizards under your control. They are good in battle, but can also be used in quests, hunting artifacts and treasures all over the map!\n\nA simple and quite good made UI may look strange, but it offers you just what you need to enjoy the game.\n\nWell worth 3.74e (holiday sale)!","December 25, 2014","true","17.9"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","0"

It has a nice atmosphere, an interesting story, and cool mechanics. It really sucks you into the Universe, where you are attempting to save three kingdoms from an Evil Empire, Mad Wizard, and Devious Cult. You play the game a few times, until you finally pull out a win against the odds... and thats it.\n\nThe game comes pre-packaged with a single senario (not counting a short tutorial one teaching you the basics of play), and once you beat that senario you have zero reason to play again. Now at 4.99 its hardly a great loss, and you probably got a couple hours of enjoyment out of it, but still. For a game with so much potential its sad to see it fall so flat. Supposedly the game was suppose to feature an editor that let you make and play your own senarios, what was given was a confusing and unhelpful web page with a ZIP file. So instead of a smooth in-game editor, your stuck with a clunky text editor that most non-coders won't be able to master in a reasonable time frame.\n\nSo if you don't mind paying five bucks for a couple hours of entertainment, then this is for you. If you were looking for a game where you could build an epic storyline full of heros, adventure, and armies, then keep looking.","March 14, 2015","false","2.8"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

I have not played very much of it, but it is a decent very old school wargame (I'm thinking of Warlords on the Commodore PET).  Logistics, supply, exploration and army building are the key components here.  I enjoy recruiting armies to my cause, then being able to control them.  I like building up my armies, searching for magic items and beasties to supplement my army.\n\nI wish the combat had at least some tactical components, but it is what it is.  It's about positioning your armies, taking out the enemy armies when you have the chance, and building experience to take on stronger armies.\n\nI have just barely gotten into the game, but I will be spending some time trying to beat this game.  Unfortunately, and this is a HUGE disappointment, there is only one campaign.  Once you beat it, that's it.  I guess you can play again on the harder difficulty level.\n\nThe developer needs to come out with more campaigns.  Hopefully this game will do well enough in the marketplace to let him/her support this game for a while.\n\nI recommend this game.\n\nOnwards!","July 12, 2014","true","1.5"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","16","22","0","0"

Beyond the likeable visuals it’s a very dry, repetitive experience that never engages you or makes you care about defending your kingdom. There’s too little at stake and not nearly enough reason to keep you trudging about the wastes. The art style is lovely and there’s clearly a great affection on behalf of the developers for classic strategy/RPG hybrids, but Legions of Ashworld quickly becomes bogged down in endless army movement, uninteresting combat and micromanagement. The core elements of a decent game are there, but there’s no meat on the bones.\n\nTOP GAME MOMENT\n\nExploring uncharted territory and meeting a new ally who provides you with much-needed supplies and troops is admittedly satisfying, but not nearly as satisfying as it should be.\n","July 4, 2015","false","2.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I expected the game to be kinda blah and to just play with the interface for a bit since it wasn't expensive to buy. My negative expections ended up being wrong, this game is well done and challenging. The only negative thing I have to say about it now is that there is only one campaign to play. Hopefully this game's developers will come out with another game with this engine with more campaigns and/or campaign editos or something.*\n\nHaving only the one campaign it's a good thing the dev's made it very difficult. My first few playthroughs were little more than some scouting around and getting killed. I've since gotten better and have managed to recruit several more armies and get another Kingdom on my side, but I still can't make a dent in the enemy's forces yet.\n\n*this engine would be great for a Romance of the Three Kindgoms campaign.","June 2, 2015","true","1.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is very quick to jump into and learn because of how shallow it is. As a fan of strategy games I tend to think of them as games that as mentally engaging, this is not a game that fits that bill. The only thinking involved is understanding the game mechanics, once that is done your journey of entertainment is likely complete. There is simply not alot of content here so for the release price I would say avoid it.\n\nThe game may be worth revisiting in a few months when it is going for 2-3$ or if it recieves significant content updates, which by significant I mean more than doubling the amount of game mechanics involved.
