(Still an entertaining game though)\n\nMany reviews here have related it to the Minesweeper, which is definitely incorrect. Now imaging a version of Minesweeper without the number tile to indicate the amount of surrounding mines, instead, you start with a certain amount of HP, while each click will deplete a small random amount of it, occasionally (also randomly), you will get your HP replenished. You just keep clicking randomly, until you have finally exhausted all HP or stepped on a mine. This, is basically a minimized model of what this game is about.\nSo, if it is Minesweeper you are looking for, go buy the Hexcells series, that's what a real "Enhanced Minesweeper" should be.\n\nHowever, one thing is true, Runestone Keeper is quite an addictive game like everyone else has agreed here, but addiction is never the guarantee of a great video game as well.\n\nAs is gambling.\n\nI had a fever for roguelike or roguelike-like or roguelite games - whatever you name it - (I have fully achievemented most well-known roguelite games, so at least the following review is not from a noob's perspective)\nThe charm of roguelite games, in my opinion, is how to improvise under different random scenarios (tough ones mostly), and overcome them with all the strategies and skills you have learned from countless previous failures.\nYes, death is everywhere in roguelite games, but in good roguelite games, every death can provides you a sense of improvement, you (as the player not your in-game character) will actually learn alot alone with every death. New strategies, skills and tricks will be gradually learnt to overcome all those seemingly impossible situations generated by bad luck. You will realize that there are always multiple ways to avoid it after each death, it is yourself to be blamed instead of the RNG itself.\nBut such sense of improvement is absolutely absent in Runestone Keeper, and there are always more improperly designed mechanisms I'd like to blame than myself.\n\nNow we are talking about Luck, of course luck is essentially involved in all roguelite games, so I tend to use a "Luck ration" when evaluating roguelite games, which is "How many percentages of luck will be needed for a decent play session (unnecessarily completed)".\nIn those best also the most well-known roguelite games, for example, The Binding of Isaac, Spelunky, Crypt of The Necrodancer, this “Luck ratio” is definitely lower than 20%, and that’s why it is even possible for skilled players to do a low% run in those titles.\nAmong those less good roguelite games, like Risk of Rain, this ration might be around 50%.\nWhat’s the difference?\nFirstly, for example, in The Binding of Isaac, even the most powerful items will turn into craps when combined with wrong ones, while items with negative effects can occasionally become totally overpowered when combined with the right ones. There isn’t an absolute good or bad item, they were just “different”. Oppositely, in Risk of Rain, there are only useless items, good items and awesome items, no strategy was involved in the decision, all you need to do was just stack more and more items as no bad consequence will result anyway.\nSecondly, most random elements in The Binding of Isaac can be manipulated or influenced by player’s action, e.g. the spawn chance of demon room and angel room. Such sense of subjective manipulation is also absent in Risk of Rain.\nThat’s why I think The Binding of Isaac is a better game than The Risk of Rain, for it has two things that Risk of Rain doesn’t have: One is Strategy, including resource management, subjective manipulation on RNG etc. The other one is “Play Style”, which is also something fundamental in most classical action games, like Devil May Cry.\n\nWell, let’s come back to Runestone Keeper, what’s the “Luck Ratio” in this case? More than 85% even conservatively estimated, I would say.\nStrategies only play a very limited role in Runestone Keeper, and most of them were quite superficial and obvious that can easily be comprehended by any player in the first 2 hours.\nAfter that, all you can do is just keep restarting again and again, until you’re finally lucky enough to grind out all the right combinations (equipment, items, traps and enemy settings) at the right times.\nWhile bad luck only means a harder time in other roguelite games, it usually guarantees a certain death in this game. There was an excessive amount of unsolvable facepunching death trap in this game, Yes, I know, I know, they are still solvable somehow with either skill A or item B or equipment C or ABC combined, however, acquiring those ABC stuff (at the right time) requires nothing but sheer luck as well. And there is nothing you can actually do about its RNG besides praying.\nA good game is all about experience, but the gaming experience provided by Runestone Keeper was consisted solely by three things: Praying – Clicking – Restarting\nThis is why I think this Runestone Keeper is more a gambling than a game. There is no doubt that gambling is still an addictive and engaging activity, but I don’t think anyone would agree that gambling is a good example for video game design except some mobile game developers.\n\nSo, as a conclusion: if you prefer gambling more than an actual game, and tend to rely more on your luck instead of skill, this Runestone Keeper might be your thing, otherwise, there were just way too many better titles in the roguelite category.","March 31, 2015","false","57.4"," 106 of 144 people (74%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","74","106","144","7","17"

It's hard to align this to any specific genre.\n_Satisfying gameplay: It's very simple stuff, but clicking on tiles to explore them feels satisfying in the way that popping bubble wraps is satisfying, if that makes sense.

That was fun in Rogue Legacy, it's fun in here.\n_Difficult: It's hard, but never truly feels unfair.\n_Deceptively simple:  It's deceptively simple, but with an underlining devilishness that is very, very rogue-like. The game isn't afraid to troll you.\n_Great pacing: Short runs (Lasts about 20-30 mins on average), but you'll be playing it over and over. It's really easy to lose track of time playing this game.\n\nCons:\n_Could use more art assets: The art is nice, but there's not enough of it... I'll be honest, I'm just nit-picking here.

You will often look back from that point and realize that there was nothing you could have done to save yourself. It is expected that this does not frustrate you as you still "progress" by spending the collected gold on upgrades afterwards.\n\nAs it currently stands, Runestone Keeper is a very accessible rogue-lite game that offers challenging experiences ranging from 10 to 30 minutes. It is alright at everything it does, your play sessions will sway rapidly between mild fun and curiosity and slight annoyance. Its distinguishment comes from the fact that even with its current flaws, it is very close to a very polished and satisfying experience.\n\nThe main weakness is balance and polish, numbers don't seem to work well with eachother which makes a few of the in-game systems and interactions useless. Your main source of continuous progress is gold - still the game asks absurd prices for single-use items, synthetizing runes and mediocre equipment - thus rendering all three almost useless. The "gold-making" upgrades and gods are also mostly a waste, either never being able to return its own cost or taking too long to do so.\n\nThe starting class is bad when compared to the other two, still it matters not much. Most losses come from impossible scenarios - although your first deaths will most likely be to bad planning - where suddenly a "winning" run stumbles upon special rooms designed to kill you unless you meet very specific criteria, which are often simply not a possibility.\n\nOverall it is a decent product, for a good price, and very close to being something satisfying or perhaps even great.","May 1, 2015","true","9.8"," 31 of 34 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","31","34","0","0"

I really did. It looked like a really quirky new rogue-lite with a concept that was different, and different is often good when it comes to video games.\n\nThis concept, however, just doesn't work. In most Rogue-like games, there's a sense of things... mostly being your fault. It's your fault you didn't prepare for the goblin. It's your fault you drank a potion you shouldn't. It's your fault that you missed your jump.\n\nIn Runestone Keeper, the game decides more often than not if you live. You can't see any of the traps unless you're lucky enough to get access to an item that tells you-- most often, you end up finding traps by tripping them. There's no real sense of improvement-- just a hope that you click the right tiles and kill just enough enemies before you meet an untimely demise.\n\nIt doesn't feel like a game that rewards skill, it feels like a game that just tosses a coin. RNG plays too much of a role in the game for it to be truly enjoyable.","June 18, 2015","false","3.6"," 49 of 66 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","49","66","0","0"

At least that's the feeling I get when I try to get through Runestone Keeper. As an adventurer, you must brave the depths in order to accomplish a thing. A lot of the story is in the background, and tends to crop up in random events. So you'll explore, find treasure, die, and repeat until you get bored.\n\nI was planning on ignoring this game. Can you blame me? Just look at it. It's a rogue-like. When it comes to game-design, perma-death has been ran into the ground harder than zombies. Every freaking game wants to see me dead, my stuff taken away, my level reduced to 1, and my progress wiped away like it never ever happened. It's freakin' obnoxious, and yet I continue to play rogue-likes, because obviously I hate myself. As a bonus, this rogue-like resembles Minesweeper. Problem-solving! Strategizing! Clicking on stuff until you lose! It's all so terrible I want to vomit out of my nose.\n\nAs expected, it took me about a dozen hours of Runestone Keeper, just to figure out how much I hate it. There are some lovely aspects. The music is nice and atmospheric, the art is effective, and the simple click-to-explore interface removes a lot of the tedium. Also, unlike a number of rogue-likes, there's a shop where you can purchase permanent upgrades. The catch is that these upgrades increase your chances of something good happening. So after several play-throughs and investing hundreds of thousands of gold, your chances of survival might go up 2%. Thanks I guess.\n\nInside the dungeon, there are multiple floors. Exploration is as simple as clicking on a darkened tile. These tiles will reveal items, traps, mysterious shrines, monsters, shops, and other random events. Monsters are interesting in that they don't actively attack, unless you choose to fight them. The exceptions are the ranged monsters, who attack everytime you move. You could search the immediate area for items to help you deal with these evil denizens, but you run the risk of spawning creatures that boost stats, or cause any number of other problems. This aspect is pretty neat, as it forces you to weigh your options. Do you kill everything as they appear? Maybe you should explore and hope to stumble upon a healing item or a rare piece of armor.\n\nI have nothing nice to say about traps in this game. Each floor is filled with them, and they will chew through your HP at a constant rate. There are items that reveal traps, but they're too infrequent. Most of the time, all you can do is click on the tiles, and pray you don't lose too much HP to spikes, falling rocks, bombs, poison, and so on. Sometimes I'll luck out and acquire a piece of armor that restores HP with every explored tile, but that's luck.\n\nRNG is easily the most dominant force in this game, especially on the harder difficulties. While you have options such as spells, items, the gods you worship, and the stats you raise; they mean nothing when RNG decides to screw you. While exploring, I ran into an Overlord. The properties of an Overlord are random, but well let me just explain this particular jerk. This Overlord was a skeleton archer. His ability was that his attack level was equivalent to my HP. Once this guy appeared, I was ♥♥♥♥ out of luck. There are tools for dealing with this situation (like throwing knives, which insta-kill any ranged enemy), but I couldn't find anything of the sort. As I mentioned earlier, archers attack everytime you move, so they can't be avoided. Since the game is entirely turn-based, I had all the time in the world to think about how much I hate RNG. Along with a gigantic middle finger, I recieved an achievement entitled "WTF".\n\nWTF indeed.\n\nEven if Lady Luck blesses you a hundred times over, you'll still have to contend with the end-boss. I've managed to reach him once. Apparently there are multiple end-bosses, and this phantom is the easiest of them. He has a big fat wad of HP, and after I hit him a few times, he split into four (WTF), and quadrupled his number of attacks. Since I can't beat him in a straight fight, I considered that it'd be a better idea to find certain items that could even the odds. At this point the problem becomes: "I need these items, but I also need to survive long enough to reach the boss, and I also need a lot of HP, plus some great equipment if I really have to fight him." Basically, I need every star to align and Pegasus to arrive on a rainbow made out of gold.\n\nRunestone Keeper does a lot of stuff right, and it can be very addictive. However, you have to account for the massive amount of RNG. Plus it's got the perma-death aspects and I...I just can't take it anymore!","October 18, 2015","false","12.2"," 64 of 92 people (70%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","70","64","92","18","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PeteOzzy/recommended/339400/","PeteOzzy","PeteOzzy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PeteOzzy/","4903 products in account","It's impossible to review Runestone Keeper without mentioning its clear inspiration, Dungelot. I realise a lot of people are detached from the mobile world so the comparison will be lost on most but there is much more than a passing resemblance to Red Winter's series of tile-tapping dungeon crawlers. It splits the review down the middle; does it offer enough to fans of Dungelot to leave behind familiar stomping grounds and does it offer an interesting experience to those that are blissfully unaware of the games it draws upon?\n\nLuckily, both questions have the same response. Yes.\n\nThe gameplay in Blackfire Games' Runestone Keeper is something of an amalgamation of Minesweeper, Dungeons of Dredmor and Desktop Dungeons. However, that's not to say it's that much like those games. Not very helpful, I know, but with the formula being shared only by two niche mobile predecessors, it becomes difficult to make comparisons you can relate to. Reviewers like to connect the dots between games so readers can quickly judge their interest yet that becomes pretty tough when it's a largely unique experience.\n\nDungeon floors are set out as a grid that can be explored in any order from your starting point, uncovering one tile at a time. Each step reveals one of many different thing, generally falling under a classification of good or bad. Most discoveries play out as you might expect; equipment offers stat boosts, traps affect you negatively and enemies invite you to turn-based combat. You can avoid most fights but monsters block adjacent squares and the key to the next floor is often in their clutches so you sometimes have to enter the fray.\n\nThankfully the game deals mostly in absolutes, so the RNG factor is kept to a minimum, certainly in battles. There's a percentage chance to hit that can frustrate but it can be counteracted with the right items, otherwise it's easy to predict how much damage you will take and if you'll win a certain encounter. Attack value hits your shields first, which absorb a certain amount of damage and then it hits your HP; very standard fare but familiarity can sometimes be comforting. There's enough creativity displayed in other elements to forgive the otherwise traditional combat system.\n\nAs easy as the gameplay seems, your first playthroughs will end pretty quickly and there's a temptation to deride Runestone Keep as being unfair and luck-based. It's true that some items are better to have than others but succeeding relies on how well you can adapt to the hand you are dealt. Finding those techniques that make short work of most foes is key, such as using Roar to disarm the foes that redirect damage twofold so that large mobs are destroyed in seconds. The plentiful traps may seem overwhelming but you're given many ways to avoid them, besides leaving a floor half-explored is often the smarter move. You will suffer your way through learning the ropes, much like most roguelikes, but the capability to win isn't locked behind a grind for XP, unlike Dungelot.\n\nThere's a wealth of layers to the gameplay, from a tattoo and enchantment system to the worshiping of deities and elite arena rooms. They're largely left unexplained which is a real shame as a poor decision can end a decent run, let alone cost incredibly precious runes. It does mean you'll be discovering new elements for many hours but a light tutorial in certain areas would have been greatly appreciated. The hint scrolls dotted around the levels tend to be obsolete by the time you pick them up. That said, the ability to right click anything to get a short description on the tiles properties is very helpful and you'll make use of it many times even once you are comfortable with the mechanics.\n\nOnce you've died more than a dozen times, discovered a few gods and know your way around the enemies and artifacts you encounter early on, the game finds itself a nice groove. It gives with one hand and rubs your nose in your mistakes with the other just like any good roguelike but it's far from perfect. An iffy translation is apparent regularly and the game can hang for a few seconds at times but it's largely bug free. There are some questions regarding its longevity though it's hard to say; maybe after a couple dozen hours the intrigue will slip, although that's a pretty reasonable lifetime given the price. The difficulty could be a little lower for some people, but then it's part of what defines the genre. Roguelikes have teeth and Runestone Keep is no exception. Sure, they're a little wonky but the smile is charming and once the fangs are in, you'll lose many hours to an unusual and rewarding little bruiser.","March 24, 2015","true","12.2"," 33 of 42 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","33","42","3","1"

It's fairly simple to learn, but definitely harder to master. Worshipping different gods, as you "collect" them, has different effects on your character, both positive and negative. You gain mana from clicking open tiles and sometimes by defeating enemies. Some enemies attack at a distance and you have to have a distance weapon or spell to reach them, otherwise you take damage every turn as you have to be in a tile adjacent to theirs. Some enemies come back to life when killed. Some buff other on-screen enemies, or get buffs as each other on-screen enemy is killed. Some have a shield bonus that you have to take down before you deal damage to the enemy. However, items that benefit you are dropped or can be purchased with gold received from defeating enemies. You also get a point upon gaining a level that you use to increase a specific stat (strength, dexterity, etc.). Sometimes you have to look at the enemies' stats and plan a strategy on the order in which you must kill them, and/or use items you have collected to defeat the enemies easier. You may have buffs, abilities, or bonuses from your stat points, items and weapons you are wearing or using, or both.\n\nAll in all, this game is, as the saying goes, easy to learn but difficult to master. Each floor you descend contains stronger and more difficult enemies, as well as different events (marked by "?") that could help or hurt you depending on the choices you make.

Ohh! Boy was I wrong, I immediately died on the first level and to boot had no idea why. After playing an hour, I realized that random clicks of tiles was not going to lead me anywhere. This game requires strategy and carefully planning of any of your resource. I died a lot during the first hour, a lot and all this in a game where you just click a path through a dungeon that is layed out in a grid.\n\nThe game has a number of RPG elements, with 4 different stats that shape the way you play. You can play as a mage, as a warrior or as a ranger, or a hybrid by filling up INT, STR and DEX. STA takes care of the way your health is replenished. You have three main resource pools, a health pool (which if emptied, you die!, Surprise!), a mana pool with which you can cast spells and a soul pool, which is the main resource pool to use items you possess or in the battlefield. A great loot drop system with a number of slots to fill helps you augment more your game, together with other elements such as worshiping gods, a runestone system that can sacrifice and use runes, and random events that provide bonuses or handicaps.\n\nBut when you die, all bonuses, god worships, items and loot disappear... except for you gold can be recycled to upgrade your character in town or buy items to prepare for your next journey. Gold is the only link between each game and it is also awarded at the end of every round.\n\nFinally, the game is hard, very hard and can sometimes be very unforgiving, piting you in situations where you cannot survive or fight it out. Each level has to be planned, how to use certain items, or to use ballistas (one shot heavy damage weapons), how to use your resources pools and how to kill each monster after each other. Monsters have certain abilities and effects, such as redirecting their damage to other monsters or healing others, and these abilities together can either be used in your favour or a combination of them putting you in a bad situation that will drain your resources. The game will not hold your hand, and you are expect to die until you get better at it.\n\nRating            Experience        5/5                Gameplay        5/5                Replay Value        4/5                Learning Curve        4/5                Value for Money         5/5                Overall        4.4/5\nSteam Rating: Yes, Recommended\n\nNote I have decided to start reviewing games as gaming is a great passion of mine.

And I consider it unique and certainly worth it's money.\n\nHowever the gameplay is stiffling.\nIt's not a true roguelike, as some elements carry over between runs, namely runes, gold and shop unlockables.\nMain problem are the runes, any rune collected and not used carries over to the next game, they are very powerful and rare. The key to success is to use the runes wisely. Additionally, many gamemodes (look up runewords) cost runes to play (most notably the endless runeword)\n\nafter your death, you can spend your gold in the shop to get passive upgrades to make the game slightly easier.\n\nSo what you end up doing is grinding. Grinding gold and runes in order to pay your expenses in a serious run, where you may want to play with a certain runeword, have prepared runes for certain gods you intend to worship and get tatoos from, and stock gold for certain items you hope to find in shops.\n\nSo when you do have a good run, you might not want to go all in in and spend your runes on the much neded tatoos in case you mess up and loose your entire investment.\n\nWhat I want to recommend is a true roguelike, where every run is a chance to play it big, where you can play all in whitout having to grind for it on countless runs in advance.\nThings this game regrettably isn't.","February 12","false","72.9"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","16","23","0","2"

I'm a big fan and avid player of many games that are a combination of or all of the mentioned genres and in particular the duneon genre games are beginning to blend together, making what had initially been a fun concept become bland and overdone repetitions.\nThis game may *seem* similar but it's a fairly simple, straightforward and, most importantly, a refreshing take on dungeon rpgs. Particular emphasis on simplicity, I never once felt like I was grinding through a floor or felt as though I had too much equipment to choose from. No option "overload" with countless varieties of weapons/armor/shields with only slightly differing abilities nor endless labyrinths of areas to explore; it's quick, it's satisfying, and it forces you to make decisions.\n\nEasy to get into and although difficult to master, you are mostly rewarded for your efforts. However there are plenty of "luck-of-the-draw" situations, so if you're the type to enjoy strategy over games of chance - you may be a bit frustrated or enraged at some of the randomization mechanics.\nLearning curve is a little tough at first: keeping track of buffs, equipment stats, realizing that you accidentally sold back the equipment you just bought, finding out that trying to buy equipment after clearing the 1st floor is a waste of your reward since you can't use/afford anything, etc. Despite the initial confusion you learn the ropes quickly after dying a few times.\n\nOverall an excellent game, worth every penny.","March 23, 2015","true","24.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

And now suddenly, it is proclaimed as the best made-in-China game of this year (and you could probably count in a few years before), to which I intend to agree. In that light, this game is a reason to celebrate, because for long I've doubted the abilities of any Chinese producers to make a decent game at all, let alone a roguelike game, which is of a quite modern concept that is much less established in the Chinese game indutries than in the western ones. But somehow, the developers succeeded to pull off this genre, and brought us Runestone Keeper.\n\nRK still has its defects, e.g. imbalance of skills or equipments (some being too powerful and desirable, while some being totally expendable); relying heavily on luck to progress into deeper floors; and certainly we need more new monsters and mechanics to contantly overcome the unavoidable repititiveness. But overall, RK could nonetheless score at least an 8/10 from me, and many other players as well, I believe.\n\nHaving said all this, I'd put a "recommend" label on RK as a conclusion, which is deserved without any doubt. And worth saying, the reason would not be "made in China but not cheap quality", but "this is a good game after all".\n\nI hope the developers keep up with their efforts.

I've installed this game on another PC using the same account, and the status file on the original PC turned out to be overwritten, so I ended up playing with the default character with no perks at all. This is somehow irritating.\n\nMoreover, I believe this game still has a lot of things planned along with the weekly updates. The diversity of each randomly generated dungeon is still pretty much limited (though less variation gives way to tactics) at this moment, but I'm positive about the quality of dungeons-- It has got great potential. More efforts need to be steered in the direction of balancing stats, fixing bugs and adding more entities to the game.","April 8, 2015","true","49.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

It is different from other rogue-likes that I have played in the past. There is no character that shows you where you are moving to, but once you get used to that it is a very deep and strategic rogue-like that rivals those out there today.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed my time playing it and find myself going back to it for a few hours of fun each time. The one downside I will say about the game is because of the limited art style, I find the game to be pretty repetative, which may turn others off to the experience.\n\nI have started a Let's Play series on this game to show you the game itself, the art style, and how I play.

So far it is very fun, hard as nails, and a little frustrating due to RNG.\nWhile it is a roguelike, it is not as difficult as some to pick up. After the tutorial, it didn't take long to get a handle on the basic mechanics,\nI recommend for people who like difficult games and roguelikes.\nFor the price, I have to recomend it highly.","March 27, 2015","true","17.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Save for some slightly stilted event dialogue, the presentation is excellent, ably negotiating between gratuitous low-fidelity and unimaginative modern rendering. A thoroughly interesting way to engage with a well-worn (and profoundly frustrating) genre concept.","October 7, 2015","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've had major comebacks that turned into run completions due to good desicion making, as well as great desicion making that just fell flat on it's face. Such is the roguelike. It fits the bill. I'm a roguelike ♥♥♥♥♥, so of course I bought it.\n\nAlright then, so why the downvote? Let's ignore the lazy UI, typos, ambiguious stats, and uncompelling quest events for the moment.\n\nSo when a designer anylizes a game that they've made, they don't always ask themselves "what's the design space of this game?" and subsequencially, "At what point am I forcing players to play the 'grindy' part of my game to reach milestones before the design space caps out?"\n\nThis game attempts to milk playtime out of the user by making them farm gold and runestones, running the dungeon over and over again to accumilate these scarce resources in hopes to make future games better (and options accesable). On the whole, I'm not in disagreement with this playstyle, but using these resources is a total crapshoot. You can blow the entirity of your runestone payload on a playthrough that slams you at level five for reasons beyond your control, leaving you feeling cheated for making a desicions that not only had very little impact on play, but were not meaningful choices, just things you farmed up in between.\n\nThis drop rate is just not satisfactory compared to the content the game actually has to offer, and is a lazy design choice, and the limited design space does given much room for gameplay expnasion. The solution should not be 'farm'. This isn't an MMO; It's minesweeper. You can only milk so much gameplay out of it. If you're going to make a score attack mode, don't make people farm for the opportunity to play that mode, just have them unlock the option once.\n\nNow add in all that stuff up top that I said to ignore, ya know, stuff that should be implimented in alpha and, at the very least, beta tested fixed. Keyboard controls. Documentations on those controls. Icons for crucial monster abilities. What the ♥♥♥♥ the luck stat does. These are 2-10 minute fixes a peice.\n\nNo, I do not recomend this game, especially not for $15. This is a $5 game, $2 during steam sale.","April 12","false","75.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To progress, you reveal tiles on a square grid, which can hide monsters, traps, usable items or various shops. Your character does not have an avatar, and monsters do not move around; attacking an enemy is simply done through clicking it. This results in fast-paced gameplay, which makes the game surprisingly addictive. There are loot drops, a magic system, gods to worship for various bonuses, and random quest events, which are always a series of dialog choices that can result in good or bad outcomes.\n\nI do recommend the game, but caution that it contains some very strong RNG. There's no way to avoid all the traps, and some levels are just paved with toxin traps that will quickly build up to a lethal does, and you will die. Sometimes there are ranged boss monsters with as much attack as your health that will literally oneshot you no matter how healthy or well-equipped you are, and if you dont happen to have an instakill item, you will die. Those elements taint an otherwise tough, but relatively fair game.","June 5","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
