"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDarkSun/recommended/330270/","TheDarkSun","TheDarkSun","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDarkSun/","326 products in account","Alright, I feel that I got the most of this game within my ~6hours of gametime. Let's see why exactly I clicked Not Recommended button.\n\nQuick summary\n\nPros:\n-Fun, fast gameplay with some skill involved\n-Many heroes to play, all of them have distinctly different abilities\n-Loot system provides basic customization\n\nCons:\n-Horrible UI and overall lack of critical information\n-Poor dificulty curve, areas 1,2 are perfect, 3 is hard as hell and 4,5 are just a breeze. Same with area bosses\n-Certain areas have extremely repetative gameplay, spawn points allow for easy abuse\n-Almost no replayability aside from trying new hero\n\nBreakdown\n\nGameplay:\nWave based action with some loot and skill progression. 5 Areas, 5 bosses. Many different heroes to play. Simple and elegant.\n\nLoot:\nYou have 5 slots that you can equip dropped items to, there are few stats and around 10 Special Abilities attached to the items themselves. Not much creativity but does the job\n\nClasses:\nTruly outstanding feature of this game, all classes feel different, have different tactics and MIGHT have a few distinct builds.\n\nHero skills:\nYou have 4 skills (aside from 1 hero who has 7) and you can level them up. This will be very familiar to players of Risk Of Rain. 4 skills, 4 button to press. Usually is goes something like - basic attack, special attack, dodge ability and some sort of an ultimate, although it might vary from hero to hero.\n\nUI:\nHorrible. Well, maybe close to horrible but still really really bad. When you try to compare pieces of equipment you only see stat comparison that is already on the previous item. Example - if your item has no armor but has cooldown reduction and if the new item has armor and has no cooldown reduction it will just show you +33 armor and will not compare non-existent stats. It is REALLY hard to compare items at a glance and you have to constantly switch from item to item to understand if you want to use one or another. Skills APPARENTLY have two different power levels, 1 is before you put 4 points into it and 1 is after. This is NOT mentioned anywhere and seems like a critical piece of information missing. Some skills SEEM to get new abilities with new power level - life steal, health regen etc , but that is also NOT mentioned anywhere, skill descriptions are only visible in tutorial and do not provide enough information. You have a certain level requirements to upgrade skill beyong certain level, but that is badly represented and the only indicator is that they are not hightlighed during the level-up process.\n\nMovement:\nVery floaty, has almost no precision, hard to dodge certain attacks. Hitting flying enemies feels like a roulette as you cannot control angle of attacks\n\nMobs:\nDecent variety, some really cool designs, some (IMHO) horrible decisions on mob power. Area 3 has the most annoying Spearman that is basically harder than any boss of the game\n\nBosses:\nFirst 2 bosses are AS COOL AS THEY CAN BE! They are fun to fight, unique and present decent challenge. The rest are boring and super-easy to fight. Seems like the developer ran out of creativity\time to polish them\n\nAreas and levels:\nHard to say. Some platfroms, some fires, some nice backgrounds. Nothing special, nothing bad.\n\nDifficulty:\nSuper-weird. First two levels are nicely balanced and present good challenge. Third Area is just super-hard due to one type of monster who can silence your attacks, slow you down AND teleport to you to punch you. One wrong move and you are dead. Fourth and fifth Areas are easy, I have not died once and never even came close to being in trouble. It seems that the late-game might not be balanced hence the weird difficulty curve\n\nReplayability:\nIn my opinion - none. Game is around 3 hours per run, by the end I felt tired and bored. Played a bit of horde mode, got even more tired and bored.\n\nOverall:\nNice game, but has very little to offer for the price. I would only recommend to buy it of huge sale, around 2-3 dollars just to try it out\n\nCheers!","August 20, 2015","false","6.3"," 183 of 208 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","183","208","4","6"

After the last wave you advance to the next stage until you reach the end of an act.\n\nYou level up and upgrade your skills, you can find and buy gear to increase your stats.\nUnfortunately, there are no unlockable abilities, only things to unlock are the characters.\n\nThere are plenty of playable characters to pick from, which all play differently.\nSometimes they might seem pretty weak at first, but that gets better as you level up your skills and get some better gear.\n\nDifficulty is a little unbalanced, act 1 and 2 are quite easy, 3 is insanely difficult, 4 is really easy and 5 is medium difficulty. You get a boss on the end of each act, but those are not too hard either.\n\nThere's also an endless survival mode with a leaderboard to play.\n\nCan't say anything about the multiplayer part, haven't tried it yet.\n\nUnfortunately, there's not a whole lot of replay value I think, unless you like to play all the characters.\n\nOverall, pretty decent game to kill some time, I really got hooked and was a little disappointed that it feels rather short, so I suggest playing this in small doses.\n\nNot related to the actual gameplay, but the developers seem really nice.\nI originally wrote a negative review because of broken controller support and I was personally contacted by a developer after it was fixed!

(See cons section for details).\n- Fast paced and can get the blood rushing.\n- Art style/theme is unique.\n- Decent music.\n\nCons:\n\n- Pretty repetitive.\n- Netcode is really really bad.\n- Sometimes your save file will just flat out erase itself for no reason.\n- Totally improper scaling of enemies. 1st area is too easy, 2nd is only slightly harder, and then 3rd area destroys your face.\n- Rainer is the only hero worth playing? The others may have interesting themes of mechanics, but they really suck in comparison.\n- The developer pushes out updates at the speed of smell. I'd wager at this point that the game has been abandoned. If I could have gotten a refund for this, I would. I just gave the game and developers too much faith.\n- The enemies aren't interesting, and they're either really easy, or unimaginably unfair.\n- Horde mode is a good idea, but it's capped at the point where you are permanently silenced (unable to use any skills) by enemies and die. Losing regardless of how good you are is a really bad design concept.\n- Horde leaderboards are plagued by cheaters, and there's no accountability.\n- Gear "choices" aren't really choices, since there's clearly superior equipment that you'll never want to substitute out.\n- Music is really really really really really really repetitive.","December 21, 2015","false","8.0"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

Needs work.\n\nPros:\n_Excellent characters: If you're a MOBA fan, you're gonna have a good time here. Characters are varied in term of play style and a lot of them are fun to play. 5 are unlocked at the start, with more unlocked as you play the game. Easily the strongest point of the game.\n_Pixel art style: A more personal point than a professional one. I really like pixel art style, this game looks quite nice in that regards.\n_Great boss fights: The bosses are big, bombastic, chalenging and fun to fight against.\n_The actual gameplay: On a minute-to-minute basis, the game is fun, nice control with lots of chaotic fights.\n\nCons:\n_Terrible level design: The moment leading up to the boss fights are just rooms, each with waves of enemies spawning one wave at a time. It's really really REALLY lazy design. There's nothing to break up the pace either. No puzzles, no platforming. As good as the boss fights are, the levels leading up to them feels more like time sinks than levels.\n_The loot system isn't interesting: Plenty of random loots here, but not all of them are interesting. As a matter of fact, most of them aren't interesting at all. If you're looking for the the kinda loot-generation depth of Diablo, Torchlight or Path of Exile, you won't find it here.\n_Some characters need balancing: I'm looking at you, Fallen Angel.\n\nOverall, you'll like this game if:\n_You want a cast of well-design, diverse playable characters.\n_You can overlook the overall design and focus on the excellent minute-to-minute gameplay.\n_You dig the art style.\n_You can stomach the levels enough to enjoy the (honestly great) boss fights.\n\nThe potential here is immense! But Warlocks needs more work to be truly great.\n\nShameless plugs time! Did you like my review? I do more than just that.

Too rough around the edges for me.\n\nLevels are too small to provide much in the way of dynamic fights. Pick the best spot for the character and camp it until the level is over. No incentive to move.\n\nCharacters aren't super interesting. Their abilities are different, but only a few feel like they really play differently. Everyone has a dash of some kind.\n\nMovement doesn't feel very tight.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aprofilehere/recommended/330270/","aprofilehere","Gunderson Mallard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aprofilehere/","2360 products in account","Playing through Warlocks while it was in development was a lot like being a parent. It seems like it was only yesterday that I had high hopes for this fantasy take on Risk of Rain called Warlocks (who goes by Warlocks vs Shadows now because he is an edgy teenager), but hoped for better item variety, more content and better enemy balancing. But now, just a few months later Warlocks vs. Shadows is all grown up and ready to disappoint me!\n\nThe characters in WvS all look very different, but whatever difference they had in playstyle gets lost quickly in the middle of mindless battles. There might be some stats and abilities that are different but none of the characters' abilities really stuck out to me. The pyromancer's channeling dance spell was neat, but other than that I just remember the characters shooting different colors and dashing around. In the opening tutorial the game explains the mechanics of each character and their four abilities, except for one character who can change forms and has 6 abilities, but none of the little tips seemed to matter because enemies just swarm you and your only concern is dealing damage. There are hardly any scenarios where I needed to use the angel's double jump, or watch the robot's overheating meter because there was no need. Overall combat lacked variety and a learning curve: everytime I started the game as a new character the tutorial walked me through every character's abilites assuring me that I would need to pay attention to all of this, but really I didn't because the enemies are weak, cooldowns are a joke, and there are no items that change up how you play.\n\nBinding of Isaac and Risk of Rain don't just have lots of items, they have lots of items that can substantially change how you play. There risks and rewards to the items: there are items that make you watch your timing, change how you move, force you in or out of battle to heal, etc. WvS trades in this gigantic arsenal of creative items and instead opts to give the player loot from enemies and a chest every few levels. There are some serious flaws with loot in WvS. Borderlands, Diablo, and every Diablo clone out there has a loot system but it works for those games because: you exploring through areas more than once and enemies are respawning. That "just one more loot drop" mentality that kept players up all night trying to find good equipment worked because they were allowed to actually explore through areas again and gamble their time away. In WvS you have to let yourself die in a level in order to make enemies respawn. On top of that, the equipment in WvS is repetitive and dull: there are a few elements that can be attached to equipment and they have 2 effects each. The stats get higher and that is it. As far as I could tell, there was no crazy sword that did something different like summon zombies on hit, or a staff that allowed you to shoot in a different direction, there were only stat changes.\n\nThe levels are designed around a fairly limited arena style while enemies spawn in waves. There are platforms and little hazards (like flame jets, and...actually, there might only be flame jets), but with such a limited area and drab design, levels feel disjointed and look the same in a given chapter. The chapters also dictate what enemies you face, but all of the enemies posed little threat and fought the same. The one exception might be an enemy that throws a spear laced with silence magic that teleports to you on hit. The boss fights have predictable patterns and are all fairly easy.\n\nThe campaign mode in WvS tries to do something different from similar games. It attempts to tell a story throughout the campaign, but that only amounts to a handful of text set between each chapter. Along with this, it is also an excuse for you to fight the same bosses in the same order. This only stacks on to the feeling of repetition with levels being the same each time, waves being similar, characters feeling the same, and items not do anything to make the game fresh.\n\nI can't recommend WvS because there just isn't any variety. I could list quite a few similar games that just offer more: alternate bosses, randomized levels, better items, more challenge, more unlocks, etc. WvS was just not fun enough. I just don't think it offers anything over its competition.\n\n*Note: I got an early key from backing on Kickstarter. I was a different person then, I was a loose cannon that backed too many projects.","March 17, 2015","false","23.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","7","8","4","1"

Then repeat. Yet between the large number of playable Warlocks, ability advancement through leveling, and gear, this game offers a surprising complexity for such a simple concept, with a large variety of possible playstyles. And the co-op and deathmatch modes let you do it all with friends.\n\nThe game is not without flaws. Although the 16-bit style graphics are mostly well executed, some of the Warlock sprites are smaller and less distinct than others. The game also starts slowly, with meaty platforming mechanics only showing up in the 2nd world. Still, this is a hidden gem for fans of the genre(s) and definitely worth a look - or a listen, as the soundtrack is incredibly catchy too.\n\nFor more thoughts on this game, check out my full review at  DecryptedGaming [decryptedgaming.com].\n","April 1, 2015","true","4.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

Very excited to see what the dev does with this game. 9/10 first look score.\nPros:\nIce Witch (character played) Seems well balanced! Hard to come by these days. Games that seem fairly balanced at least.\nEnemies are very creative and are distinct. Enjoyed learning their traits and how to fight them.\nItem upgrading is progressive and well paced.\nAbilities were fun to level and combined nicely with each other AND with item ability procs.\n\nCons:\nBeing a grinder, I felt I should be able to return to previously visited levels. Not the case (yet?).\nCertain elements of levels seemed unneccesary. I was able to sit in a corner if I felt like it, game didn't really force me to use/dodge elements of the environment.\nAbility tooltips are a must.\n\nSuggestions for the developer:\nInteractive items on levels (explosive barrels, buttons that activate level things when YOU hit them, etc.)\nItems that grant set bonuses\nJump height being a stat, make high jump accessible only areas\nSecret cubbies on levels with chest/loot/health/etc.\nThrough this dev phase can we please new game+ toons or something >:O\n\nThere's always more things to suggest, but that's all I've got for now. I am glad I pre-purchased into this game, If you're on the fence on it and you can afford the $14, my vote would be to do it.\n\nTL:DR - Worth donating to the cause, games got it goin' on.","March 28, 2015","true","14.1"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

I backed during the Kickstarter phase and haven't regretted my decision! I anticipate that 6.5 to reach an 8/10 or higher given what I have seen so far, and based on the fact that review is for the current early-access game.\n\n-More Detail-\n\nProgress:\nProgress does feel slow because the gameplay from level to level is the same kill-all-enemies, and the only change between levels is power, map layout, the occasional new enemy and backgrounds (which are both definitely refreshing to see).\n\nCharacters:\nEarning characters through the story gameplay is rewarding as, currently, each new character comes from winning a boss fight. It feels meaningful and at the same time adds mystery as to why these characters come from where they do.\n\nItems:\nItems, being randomly generated, are nice to get, and fun to mix and match through the game. Players can equip at any time, and, while not realistic, is nice to adjust in case one of the many possible combinations of item effects don't quite work one's style of play.\n\nStory:\nEvokes some wonder, and, while I don't feel it is [currently] one of the strongest points of the game, does have intriguing art and the visuals and text say enough to get their point across to the player.\n\nMultiplayer:\nI have yet to touch on this feature, but at about 6.5 hours, and one full singleplayer playthrough, I feel like this could be a winning experience for some players. Others have played with friends/family/etc., so please see those other reviews for more detail.","March 17, 2015","true","25.0"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","6","11","2","0"

There's a few things I think anyone reading this should know before buying.\n\n1) The developers mean it when they say they're withholding content until release.  I have completed all of the early access storyline in the first day.\n\n2) There is no "choose an act" option, at least not yet...This means when you hit a rock, you're stuck until you wiggle your way to freedom.  It can be really frustrating to face content you don't feel prepared for.\n\n3) Skills have no description, or at least no easily discernable method of locating.  It's a shame I thought one of the best characters in the game was terrible because I didn't stumble on their synergies until the very end.\n\n4) You get to spend skill points, but whatever you allocate to whatever button, say skill 1, is allocated to skill 1 for all other Warlocks.  This is probably the most frustating part of the game...Certain characters definitely excel with more power in certain skills, but you are pretty much forced into adapting to a single character unless you are able to find an overlap or just evenly distribute.\n\n5) Items are dull and unclear in purpose until their stats are tremendously higher.\n\n6) THIS IS NOT RISK OF RAIN.  There are graphical similarities, but this is in no way a rogue-like.  There is no tension of impending doom.  The game's merit is in testing your ability to manuever in a relatively small arena against a relatively large pack of enemies.  It takes skill, but there is no "monsoon doomsday clock" breathing down your neck.\n\n7) There is no endless mode or anything othere than PvP and completely restarting once you finish EA...It's kind of tragic to build up your Warlocks only to suddenly be unable to enjoy them.\n\n8) Finally, PvP doesn't have an online "find/host a game" feature.  Kind of pointless for those without the capacity to couch co-op.\n\nAll of that said, the game is excellent.  It's rare that I invest time into a game on early access equal to the value paid...And even though I'll have to start over, I'm sure I'll be running through the game with my friends this weekend!","March 17, 2015","true","5.3"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","8","16","3","0"

But instead its a wave based game, which is just fine aswell. First try I did, it killed me right away. Not knowing the controls very well. But with a little bit of training I got it under control. Feeling smooth to play and very enjoyable aswell. Just played one char so far, but I know for sure that I will be playing a lot more of them.\n\nItem customization is pretty good. Having items with bonus skills like your skill Z now also applies 80% less movement speed for 1.5 seconds or 31 fire damage each time you use a skill, etc. The total game time is about 3-4 hours right now for one walkthrough. So playing multiple characters, also unlocking new characters, will extend this game time. It is ofcourse early acces, but most of the content is already released. Maybe next game plus will be added later?\n\nCo-op and PvP doesn't seem to work yet for online, there is an online co-op but there are zero rooms. Hopefully this will be better once the game gets more players. I don't see any options for online PvP except for local. So I hope this will be introduced aswell, really curious about this one!\n\nSo is it worth your bucks?\nI would say yes, if you don't mind playing multiple characters repeating the same content.\nAnd if you like a kick-♥♥♥ 2D Combat game, especially if you have some friends to play with.\n\n(Like to see first 5 minutes of the game?, then check out this video)\n\nhttp://youtu.be/2Nxph2azPzU","March 17, 2015","true","15.5"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","6","12","0","0"

There was one issue where the 2nd player couldn't get to the gear menu to change out gear, but we worked around it by going back to the title screen and switching 1p/2p.  The character balance needs a lot of work, but all in all, it was one of the best couch co-op experiences in recent memory, even for a game in alpha.

Surprisingly this game has been relatively close to what I expected, which isn't common.\n\nThe art style is - as some people have commented in then forum - quite similar to risk of rain. However it is a little larger (which in my view is more appealing) and the backgrounds have a bit more detail.\n\nThe campaign mode consists of small maps, each map has waves of enemies to destroy. After several maps you fight a boss, unlock a character and progress to the next stage.\n\nAs you advance in levels you can level up skill slots, of which you have four, you also collect equipment. Your progress, skill slot level ups, and equipment are save slot bound - leaving you free to switch between characters between any map and maintain your level, gear and progress. This works quite well and alows you to switch to mages that may be advantagious for any given map and prevents you from getting bored of the same old skills.\n\nI'm not a huge fan of the campaign mode. That being said in this type of game I generally only do the campaign to unlock maps and characters. The campaign mode isn't boring, and, is at a perfect difficulty. Quite challanging but not offputtingly so. However there are a few skills on some warlocks which when leveled up can be exploited for easy, tedius victories. However given the early access status of the game and the overall balance I imagine this will be addressed quite quickly - or at least by the time the product is finished.\n\nThe versus maps are appealing and well designed. The warlocks are better balanced for versus mode, however there are some skills that still have some balance issues. Furthermore the warlocks have interesting and creative skills with very different playstyles. Chaging between warlocks makes the combat very different.\n\nFor those who are sceptical about purchasing early access games I would recommend that this one is worth it.

The main downside is that after clearing the game, you finaly unlock every missing characters, but you have little motivation to re-play the whole game. The pvp aspect i cannto comment on, having not tried it, but i will mention that not all characters seem to be balanced for pvp.\n\nThe meat of the game is an action platformer, not unlike risk of rain or similar games. The difference is that the levels are smaller and function on a 'wave of enemeis' system, clear them and finish the level. Special mention for the awesome boss fights too! It is enjoyable when played with a character you enjoy the mechanics of. The game is fun if you can get it cheap and even better if played with friends. It is not perfect but it will give you a few hours of fun!\n\n-Lost","January 3","true","8.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

You can't remap keys and the jump is bound to up stick button which is plain awful.

So you are either forced to start over or wait for fixes.\n\nCharacters seem very unbalanced in their difficulty as well, with ranged warlocks being easier to play and more powerful overall.\n\nWhile i like the aesthetics and the challenge this game poses, i can't recommend it right now, at least not until that major game breaking bug is fixed.\n","March 21, 2015","false","3.9"," 16 of 33 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","16","33","0","0"

Its looked very promised, but had few major bugs.\nDays switched days, and once devs lost interest to their project. Probably they got not as much money as they wanted, probably their love to their child gone... But they did it. They added "Zardonic" character and released unfinished game.

Not as much songs as could be, but they are atmospheric.\n\nCons:\n- Graphics. Very soapy, no option to switch resolution. YES, NO RESOLUTION SWITCH IN 2K15 (when its released)\n- Lack of items\n- Bored grindly levels with no reasons to replay (except characters unlock, but its weak motivation)\n- Empty multiplayer.

I am really suprised how much I am enjoying a game, that I just so happened to find wandering around the rpg pages of the steam store. The controls are really responsive allowing for really clutch game play, the boss fights are engaging and always keep you on your toes (took me i think 10 times to beat first boss frustratingly fun), online/local multiplayer which is always a bonus since I play with a small group of guys. Only issue I had with the multiplayer was the lag (It may be because I am playing currently on hotel internet, leaning toward that.) The single player mode kept me playing by itself, and I am the kind of guy who will buy a game and play it for maybe an hour and then drop it. The multiple warlocks really keeps the game fun to and the Tutorial allows you to try out all the warlocks and giving you hints on all there different abilities (aka its not a copy paste tutorial with just basic knowledge, probably because no mouse so you can view tooltips). I would say one thing they could add is while in warlock select I can see what abilities they have I had to make a new profile to view all the other warlocks after i immediatly played in online multiplayer.","April 12, 2015","true","5.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Because in the first hour the only thing I did, was spawning in a small arena and kill one wave of mobs after another and I didn't even know why..","March 20, 2015","false","0.9"," 23 of 51 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","23","51","0","0"

The spells you cast as the warlocks vary from character to character, and there are a lot of characters to choose from.  The objectives are straight forward and no fuss.

It is extrememly buggy and makes additional gameplays of it difficult if not impossible unless you create new profiles.\n\nMy view:\nThe gameplay and the amount of options are excellent. Several heros to choose from and good item drop system. I initially got the game cause it looked like it was a good local co-op, and it was... to a point.\nPros.\nExcellent Game play\nEasy learning curve to pick up and play\nWaves get More difficult at each stage\nMultiple characters and game plays\nLocal co-op increases difficulty for more players\nCons.\nThe interface is terribly done. (After selecting a mode you may have to start the game and select quit to get back to the main menu!)\nNot often, but some of the levels have acted... buggy. (One levels background was glitching... blinking in and out repeatedly. Only happened once.)\nIf you beat the game with a character in Single or Local Co-op that character can "infect" other characters... as I would put it. (explanation: You can choose the level you go to after you beat the game with that character, but when you do local co-op, probably does the same in online co-op, if you select the character who beat the game, your friends character and your character go up against the final boss. Their character is now viewed as either being on the final level against the final boss or is viewed as beating the game and offered the level select next time they are played in single player mode.)\n\nIf you get this game I would recommend getting it on sale because of most of the interface bugs that make it hard to call 'user friendly'. If you get this game, have fun, good luck, and try not to get frustrated with the interface, and if they make a second one of these games I may still have to get it cause the game play was good, but I hope they fix these issues and make more replayability.\n\nLocal co-op recommendations:\nI would also recommend  beating the game with one profile, in single or co-op, so you have all the characters and always loading that profile when you start. Then when your friend joins you to play or if you simpley want to start a new profile with all the characters, go to story and select local multi-player, then load the newly created profile. This will allow your new profile and your local friends new profile to access all the characters through the initial profile (The characters will start at whatever level you had them at, so you won't be on the final boss and they won't be Level O.P.)","September 7, 2015","false","13.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It seems to mix the concept of Risk of Rain with Smash Bros, and it is doing it well!\n\nThe game offers three different game modes - Story, Horde and Multiplayer and few diverse characters (no idea how many of them are actually in-game, as  some have to be unlocked first). The playable heroes are all completely different, and their skills are not just different colored versions of other spells, but they work completely different. For example, Anya is quick, can slow enemies and uses icy powers, while Borubar is a melee-tanky-archetype.\n\nThe story mode consist of different levels in different areas. Do not be fooled by the looks though - the game might looks like it's a platformer, but it's actually a 2D brawler. A good brawler, to be exact. The gameplay is quite challenging, especially at the later levels. The bosses seem to be especially hard - might be a bit easier in the co-op mode, but I didn't have a chance to try it yet.\n\nAlso, the graphics and music in game are wonderful.

I managed to have some free time with my boring life to play this game, and beat the game with each character, so far, it was a great experience since I enjoyed playing Risk of Rain.\n\nPros:\n\nEach character has their own unique playstyle, each with their own advantages and disadvantages.  Leveling up skills for some characters add different animations / strengths to them.\nItems are interesting, their stats are randomly generated, but adds some depth to how lucky you can get with your gear if you're greedy to seek better items; the shop helps with this too. The bosses are pretty fun to fight, they're pretty creative since the animation in this game is pretty fluid; can be fast-paced depending on your character/playstyle.\n\nCons:\n\nYes, this game is in its early stages so there are plenty of bugs, for example, some item passives don't stack, character can become bugged easily or glitched and end up at the last boss somehow, etc. This doesn't happen very often, but nonetheless, -it can-. Multiplayer isn't in its best shape... there's hardly any functionality, but i'm sure it will be fixed in the future. Also, the game difficulty itself can be pretty dull, you'll inevitably reach a certain point where you'll just become really strong and beat everything since difficulty won't change, unless you're not lucky with RNG or messed up leveling skills for the character. Skills don't have a tooltip so you won't really know what you're upgrading other than figuring it out with common sense. Bosses are very limited with their capabilities, thus becoming really easy to beat. Some stages of the game can become extremely boring since the spawnrate is really slow. In regards to the melee characters, their attack animation for the Z really screws them over and sets them apart from the ranged character where there's no delay (animation) stopping them. Items are extremely limited to stats. Sure, there are different combinations for passives, randomly generated stats for whatever item, but there's not much diversity in regards to gameplay. It's either you have 1 or 2 of the 6-7 innate passives (which don't stack) for each item.\n\nUntil they fix these, add difficulties, and other challenges, i'd say 7/10 because like I stated earlier, I see a lot of potential in this game.","June 8, 2015","false","56.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Many of the player's attacks just automatically target the nearest enemy, so it never really feels like there is actually any skill involved. The loot and the shop system are also a joke.
