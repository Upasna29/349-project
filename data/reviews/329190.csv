In Volo Airsport you take to the skies as a humble stick man sporting a wing-suit, whether you wish to go proximity flying right up against a ravine or wish to fly high above the world and take in the beautiful views you're gonna have fun with Volo. Despite being available to buy through Early Access for a few months now and being available even before that (DRM-Free) there's not a lot to do right now though from their website it's clear to see that Ramjet Anvil are working on some cool things which will only make the game better.\n\n+Good graphics combined with a fair bit of graphical customisation\n+A unique idea of flying around in wing-suits, obviously this has appeared in some games before but there's never been a full game based around it\n+Great flight physics which feel realistic\n+If you so wish you are able to have a predicted trajectory displayed on screen as well as aerodynamic forces (independent of each other) as well as the usual stuff like airspeed indicators and altitude displays\n+Four different camera angles\n+Very relaxing to play\n+The map currently available is quite large but it's smaller than it looks due to there being extremely strong winds which stop you flying that way\n+VR Support. Now this is something I usually wouldn't care about as I don't really like VR but Volo has actually made me want to get an Oculus just for the first person camera mode flying right up against the ravines\n+Challenging time trial events\n+Has a built in time trial course editor for you to make your own courses which can then be shared with other people\n+Good controls (360 controller, unsure about Keyboard) which include some cool moves for your character, such as curling up into a ball\n+The HUD can be disabled, allowing you to take some great screenshots of the game world\n+Great soundtrack which adds to the relaxing feel of the game\n+Friendly dev(s)\n\n-Currently only one map\n-As mentioned there's not too much to do right now\n-Shadows are a tad glitchy in first person\n-It's been a while since there was an update on progress or an actual, downloadable update for the game but it is a very small team with limited resources so it's to be expected\n\nHere's a short gameplay clip I recorded:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=442135141\n\nVerdict:\n8\n\nVolo Airsport, while lacking in content, is a fun and relaxing wing-suit game with good graphics, great physics and an interesting concept. If you're an Oculus owner or just someone who enjoys taking a relaxing flight through the skies in a game then this is not one to pass up on.\n\n***This review was written using a key provided by the Developer of review purposes***\n\nEl K.","May 13, 2015","true","4.2"," 64 of 77 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","64","77","0","9"

This is one more case of what I like to call "Early access trap". You pay 13 euros for a game that promises that one day some content might be included in the game, but 1,5 years after I first bought it they barely have introduced anything to the game. Stay away from it.\n\nP.S.: Wtf is wrong with people these days? I see positive reviews for a game they barely update, while I see negative reviews on games that update every 3-4 months claiming "the updates take too long".

Worth keeping in mind as it is rated as *Negative*.  I've kept my original review below as it is worth reading through the chain of comments that sparked off, due to my unhappiness, and the responses involved thereafter (10th Apr - 10th May).  To my surprise, the developers were not, as suspected by me, camped out in a bar, but are indeed still working on this project, perhaps with renewed vigour.  Who knows?\n\nSo, reviewing this again since I've had time to re-play and re-test.  It's definately more stable.  Actually, a lot more.  I regulary had to 'force quit' the previous version as it hung during loading about 50% of the time.  This one for me, had never failed to start since it came in and I've been in and out of it maybe 20 times so far.\n\nAs for the content change itself, I was hoping for something more significant than a few shacks and hated wind turbines dotted around as eye candy.  However, we are still promised parachutes and multiplayer.  No mention of more map choices as yet, but I'll be keeping an eye out for update news snippets for future possibilities of worthiness.  The sound output has also changed from being active, to passive.  I can't tell anymore just how close I was skimming past surfaces.  Something I loved.  Instead, now it sounds like a flag fluttering at 15mph no matter how close I get  to a virtual surface.  Oh, and there's dynamic grass now!  A nice touch for when you do eventually hit the deck at high speed, but "Mehh"\n\n\nWhy have I rated this as Neutral?  Purely for the following reason.  I would recommend this, but for the lack of proof.  Proof of commitment and fervour.  One released update in 6 months dosen't do them justice.\n\nMy ultimate recommendation then, is to watch and wait.  Stick it on your wishlist, or follow it.  See for youself if it's worth bothering with in a few months time, or set your own timescale as I can't even guestimate what will happen next with this project.  Perhaps take a chance and buy it if you've got the cash to spare.  To help them out and all that......\n\n\n****Original Review Below****\n\n\nEarly Access..  Pahh..    ...Should read "Early Abandonment"\n\nDon't bother with this.  After 6 months of complete silence from the (dare I use the word) devs, my feeling is that you'll just end up feeling robbed while they pocket your cash.    ...Unless some crazy update happens, this review will remain to help guide people away from this as an investment of faith.  6 months ago, I had faith they would pull through and took a chance as there are just 2 people working on this.  As of today, I have every faith that they've abandoned this project and set up camp at a bar.\n\nI can barely manage 5 mins a day in it's current state as it just gets boring after a while","April 17","false","21.7"," 26 of 28 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","26","28","0","4"

Can't see this getting any better soon and as it stands it is definitely a case of nice idea, poor execution.  Will change this review if the devs become more active and it appears that we might get something more like a finished game without the flying "stick men" - I want to see the toon in a proper wing suit for starters!

Nothing beats ripping down a cliffside at 135mph and just one little mistake can be fatal.  The game's physics and mechanics are amazing, the controls are well done and playing with a controller is key.  You actually fly through simulated air pockets, lifts, and gusts while cruising at speeds of 100 to 160 + mph just feet above the ground...well that is the way I like to fly anyways.  The beauty of this game is the map is open, drop in from one of the various spawns some simulating base jumps others simulating jumping out of a helicopter.  Really well done little game how it stands right now, something new finally.\n\nIts early access, meaning not much content small in size around 150mb.  Do not let that discourage you from buying this game, Volo Airsport has a lot of potential here.  Can't wait to see whats in store for the future.\n\n\nA few things I hope to see in the future:\n\nReplays\nDifferent outfits, "wingsuits"\nCustom spawn points\nCreate your own custom runs placing rings where you want them\nNew maps\nAbility to parachute at the end\nMultiplayer "usually not a fan a MP games, but this one would be fun with other players"\nMap Editor","December 14, 2014","true","11.0"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

I have always wanted to fly. Ever since I could recall, I looked up in the sky and wanted to be a bird - To fly. To truly fly. I wanted to soar between mountains, inside valleys, around cliffs and over forests.\n\nUnfortunately, humans can't do that. But this game...\n\nThis game does that.\n\nThere is no story.\n\nThere is nothing but you, your wingsuit, the mountains and the air.\n\nSimply beautiful in its purest of forms.\n\nI hope they update the model, but... otherwise... simply, utterly beautiful in its simplicity and awesomeness.\n\nIf there is one game on all of steam... just one... this is it.

Everytime he dies, he must fly again, only to blast into the ground at 180 kmph. He does some tricks on the way down, barrel rolls, backflips, enough to get the adrenaline flowing. I can only hope that the rush is enough to dull the pain.\nAll jokes aside however, this is definately the best proximity wingsuit flying game to date. Well optimized, handles great with a controller.

For now there isn't a ton of stuff to do in the game but don't worry the game is still really entertaining. I do feel like the developers will grow this game into a much bigger game and make it even more fun than it is now.\n\nPositives:\n+Creative.\n+Pretty original.\n+Pretty graphics.\n+Easy to learn.\n+VR support.\n+Fun.\n+Lots of graphical options.\n+Speed counter and a few other things.\n+Relaxing.\n+Course editor.\n+You can play other people's courses.\n+Wind.\n+Good physics.\n\nNegatives:\n-Not a whole lot of stuff to do.\n-Some graphical glitches here and there.\n-Only 1 map.\n\nAdded Notes:\n\nThis game for now like I said does not have a ton of stuff to offer but if you are looking for a relaxing flying game then this is a game I recommend. I will also probably updates this review once the game has fully released.\n\nOverall I rate this game a  7.5/10  pick this game up if you want to glide the skies and just relax for a few hours.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group\nCheck out the Original Network Groups.

A moment was the most you could ever expect from perfection." -Chuck Palahniuk, Fight Club\n\n\n[Long version! (scroll down for short one)]\n\nWhat is it?\n- a game about flying\n\nHow long does it take?\n- single jump can be anything between a couple seconds, up to about 10 minutes for now, with an averge speed flight close to earth being about 60-120 seconds... so not really long, but "A moment was the most you could ever expect from perfection."\n\nWhat's the story?\n- for now: You got kicked out of heaven, you have very short time to live; Learn to fly or die.\nMake the most of the time you have left, soar through air, fly as close to earth as you can, fly as fast as possible, find the way to never touch the ground, enjoy the stunning sunset above beautiful mountains as your short life as a blue stickman angel comes to an end. There's but a one rule for now - ground is lava.\n\nWhat can i do in it?\n- master the art of flying, gliding, proximity flying, some other technical terms, AND CANNONBALLING!\n- download players made challange paths (from Volo forum[forum.volo-airsport.com])\nmake your own paths and fly them as fast as you can\n- fly around seeking new paths to fly, new winds to use, making stunts along the way just for the thrills\n- select a spawn point from which you begin\n- change the camera view (left foot and right foot(GoPro style), first person, third person, frontal, and free view(two last not really usefull for flying but you can get nice photos ;D))\n\nIs it easy to play?\n- Not at all! For now there's no tutorial, but that's not a big problem since the controls are intuitive and it sets your brain on fire - first, to survive the fall, then to fly as far as you can, finally to fly as close to earth as possible doing stunts while flying as long as you can. It can be frustrating at the beginning, since your experience with it won't be like the trailer, but if you put your mind to it, you'll quickly learn to fly and begin to understand the mastery of the Art of flying!\n\nIs it worth it?\n- depends on how much you're fascinated by flying.\nIf you dig skydiving, wingsuits, basejumping and all that stuff, i think you'll love this game!\nDespiting not much of content (for now), the game already offers amazing physics to play with, along with captivating gfx. It all feels very natural and realistic.\nIt's challenging - don't only limit yourself to flying as fast as possible. Do cannonballs, make turns, spin around, fly on your back, learn the winds and how to use them and you'll be flying for many minutes in a single jump.\nCreate the crazy course using all of the above and see how fast can you and others make it!\nThe devs are active and communicating with players, and there's a lot of stuff to come!\n\n\n\n[Short version]\n\nWhat can i do for now?\n+ fly with wingsuit stickman\n+ select a spawn point\n+ create, share and download fly courses (sharing and download via Volo forum)\n+ perform some stunts while flying\n+ use controllers as well as kb&mouse\n+ die infinite numbers of times by all kinds of unsuspected wind changes while flying at high velocities straight into the ground or mountains... or just pure suiciding :P\n\nWhat can't i do for now?\n- make the jump by yourself\n- use parachute to land safely\n\nWhat's in there to come?\n+ Please, see the official Early Access info[volo-airsport.com]\n\n\nAs an ordinary player, for now i'd give it a strong 5/10\n\nAs an enthusiast that looks for the game about wingsuits, that would give you the thrill of realistic flight, not story based and long, but captivating and moment taking, the score is 7/10 for now.\n\nFinally, when the game spreads it's wings (more content), make the score 9/10\n\n\nFinal word?\n\nI say Volo Airsport is well worth the price as it is now.\nSome may disagree; it's all about seeing and living the moment and will to master the art of stickman flight. It seems simple, but it's hard to master, with a lot of place to play around with pyshics and aerodynamics.\nI found nothing better after a stressfull day, than to put my headphones on, play some sweet music and fly the stress out!","February 11, 2015","true","173.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Volo is all about the freedom of flight in a wingsuit. It is different from other games because it has no real competition, leaderboards, or main goals (as of yet). There are no winners or losers, only people who learn to soar, and those who master the art of faceplanting.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPros:\n-Great developer\n-Cheap price ($13 as of now)\n-Tiny file size (almost 500mb, takes 3 minutes to download)\n-Amazing graphics\n-Oculus Rift and gamepad support\n-Stunning physics and aerodynamics\n-Wind and sound very clean and smooth\n-Friendly developers (have had a chat with Ramjet Anvil and Frank V. more than once about Volo)\n-Future plans to include parachutes and such\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCons:\n-Like all indie games, it is still under development and has multiple bugs\n-Character model rather simple, just a blue human figure (red if you crash hard)\n-No real goal or point (but that may be the idea of the game, just a stress reliever)\n-Extremely simple, but controls are difficult (using keyboard)\n-No instructions or tutorial, you are (literally) thrown off a cliff and told to fly\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOverall, if you are reading this, then you must be considering getting Volo.

After all the years since, this game is it.  It's almost like the tagline for the first Christopher Reeve Superman movie: you will believe a man can fly.\n\nI don't have VR gear, I crash all the time, there's no real goal, you can't land safely, it may never get finished - but I don't care.  I have so much fun gliding and taking in the scenery, I haven't regretted the $13 I paid for it (and you can get it for less elsewhere, including the developer's site.)  For the price of a movie ticket, I pick this up and play for however long and then put it down, to come back for more at other times.  It's relaxing and cathartic.  No software crashes, runs well, and its concept of physical flying works like a charm.\n\nThese devs deserve support for making a game that is different and already solid.  And I believe they will keep trying to finish it.  I urge anyone on the fence about purchasing to do it.  You'll know well within the Steam two hour return window whether it's right for you.  And I predict for most, they'll be pleasantly surprised.\n\nFor real fun, try the first person perspective.  Not for the easily queasy but a real trip trying to correct oneself without the avatar to watch.","May 22","true","4.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(I'm calling it a product because its a long way from a game). This is severely unfinished, it resembles the quality that comes from a game developer class playing around with flavour of the moment game engine. There is not much to do right now, except to fall to your inevitable "death" - which isnt in the game yet either. It is a playground being the point, well a playground should be fun.\n\nComparing this simulator to other unique niched simulators like ETS2, this games features looks pale in comparison (even Goat Simulator packs more features) and it need some development time, maby it will be good in 2015-2016.

While this may not be a review, it does make note that a controller will make game play more enjoyable, and perhaps a bit easier.\n\nWith that, I recommend the game.","November 12, 2015","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It currently is a shell of a game, as early access games are supposed to be, but the core of the experience is satisfying and fun.\nThe general ambiance and core physics are incredibly cool to play with, and I suspect will be the main draw for a while.\n\n[EARLY ACCESS NOTES]\nThere is only one mountain in the game, and time trials are in, but that is pretty much it. The soundtrack is absent from what I can tell, so play something with it. Someone on the discussion suggested boards of Canada, it works really well.","January 17, 2015","true","0.7"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

The physics are very good, the play is relaxing and easy to reset and do again. Even without being fully fleshed out I can already see the potential.
