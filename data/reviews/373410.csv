It's always tricky evaluating these early access titles because there's always a promised feature set, but I strive to give an impression of the game as it is and not what it promises to be.  As I'm sure many of you reading this know, this type of game (the god game/city building game) has had a very harrowed early access experience with the terrible situations we have in Towns, Stonehearth, Castle Story and more.  It's an awesome genre plagued by failure, and because of that (not the devs' fault here) I am very cynical about this genre.\n\nThere currently isn't a whole hell of a lot to do because it's still very early in early access and the included features are very limited.  HOWEVER, I will say that the features that are in are working pretty damn well and the developers are VERY hard at work to improve the game day after day after day.  The in-game change log is damned impressive and shows some passion for the work their doing.  I believe that one day this game will be amazing, but right now it's just a pretty game with cool concepts and a lot of potential.\n\nIf you want to support this game and dive in, by all means do so!  Like I mentioned, the developers are clearly passionate about what they're doing and are very communicative, which is an enormous selling point that inspires confidence.  However, if you're more wary about your purchases, I advise you to just add this to your wishlist or watch list or follow list or however you follow early access/indev titles.\n\nNow about the actual game, since I've rambled about early access enough:\nThe game features a beautiful voxel aesthetic and includes some neat ideas like shepherding wild animals into fences to create a ranch, cook complex meals with food, and buildings that you have to power with electricity-generating machines.  The electricity part is very bare-bones at the moment and hard to do (because of reasons I'll mention in a bit), but that's a mechanic that, at it's core, is enough to really differentiate itself from many other titles in this genre.  Not many care about electricity *at all*.\n\nAnother reason it sets itself apart: THE AI ISN'T HOPELESSLY BROKEN.  They're a little confused at times (it's early access still, after all), but you don't have the AI pull a Stonehearth and just refuse to work ever again.  The one time I saw it, it was identified by the devs and fixed very promptly!  Nothing's more frustrating then lazy AI people.\n\nMain reasons I can't recommend this game at the moment (aside from relatively small feature set) is because the game can become really tedious pretty quickly.  The UI is clunky and the game is currently missing a lot of small quality of life things like farm auto-harvesting (must right click each individual crop and click harvest) or easy crafting of a ton of building materials (gotta click one at a time).  Placement of building materials is a bit spotty, and the interface sometimes doesn't quite respond the way you want it to leading to a bit of confusion.  Plus you're stuck with a measly 6 kin, so if you wanna go crazy and build a lot it will take about 50 years (hyperbole) to build anything big.\n\nIf you're like me and this is a genre where you desperately want a game to succeed and deliver, at _least_ watch this game to see how it grows over time.  Follow videos and development.  Or if you're excited, go ahead and buy it and speak with the developers!  As far as I can see they're very communicative and open to feedback.

It's EA but it's great to know the devs are taking advice from the players.\n\nI have suggested a few things to lessen the tedious micromanaging at the moment, like the kindred doing jobs based on their needs or being assigned to certain task. I feel like this game will develop into something fantastic and far beyond other games similar to it if they add those few features such as.\n\nKindred hunting and taming animals based on the needs of the people, so if the town is hungry a kindred with excellent hunting experience will go out and fish or kill for some meat, a more intelligent kindred will know when to tame/herd a certain species of animal not to extinct the area from over hunting.\n\nKindreds should build things based on their needs, if a kindred desires a bed all the time he should go chop down some wood, build the tool to make it, or use whatever is fully stock in the inventory to satisfy his desire and needs.\n\nif you want specific kindreds with more experience to do a better job at a certain task you should jsut be able to select them and assign them what to do, if that task is fullfilled perhaps they can help with secondary needs.\n\nWhen kindreds age they should be able to teach younger kindreds how to chop down wood/wire things/hunt\n\nsince this is a foreign world I also think there should be unique creatures and other creatures/animals building in the world with you, this will differientiate the game almost immediately from the other ones.\n\nstone hearth has giant monsters that will attack..all sorts of interesting random events, so hoping to see what kind of innovations the kindred can come up with.\n\nanyways this is EA and hopefully all of that will make it into this game or some form of it does.\n\nlove it so far.","February 24","true","2.1"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

Feedback is definitely being taken into consideration, and bugs are being addressed appropriately. I haven't logged a lot of hours as of yet, but I can already tell that this is gonna be a great time-spender for me.\n\nThe building aspect (while a little buggy, as most early access games are) has a good amount of depth, and plenty of room for creativity, with a wide selction of building materials and fairly intuitive tools. In addition to building voxel homes, there are power sources required for things like lighting, which adds realism.\n\nThe survival simulation is pretty straightforward - grow crops, raise animals for meat, milk, wool, etc. and generally just keep your peoples happy and healthy. An exciting planned feature is the population being increased through childbirth, which is something most sim games like this lack.\n\nThe only drawback is the somewhat confusing UI, but after poking around a bit, it's not too hard to get the hang of, more or less, and while it's something I can live with, I'd love to see it improved at some point.\n\nIf you are into survival games, sim games, voxel games, or just looking for something peaceful to play and be creative with, this is definitely worth consideration.","April 29","true","5.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It might just be that simple for The Kindred. A titled brimming with promise even in this initial Early Access stages. Colorful and charming, with nice looking water and shading effects for a block based game.\n\nThere is a lot to create and play around with and there is a lot more planned for this game is it develops over the coming months. Yes, it feels like a blank canvas at the moment. But one where you can almost "see" the wide horizon of possibilities. Once the starvation, kin families, and predators are in this is going to be one exciting game taking the best things of block breaking and building and mixing it with the survival/management aspects of a city builder. The Kindred is poised to be a memorable entry.

You'll have a group of six people, at least on the normal difficulty on this first day in early access.  You need to keep them working and micro manage them enough to start growing food, crafting a comfy bed to sleep in, and gather the resources needed to survive and increase their standard of living as the game progesses.\n\nEverything seems to work really well, especially considering the early state of development.  I love it so far, and am having a lot of fun.\n\nI'll have a much more in depth review once I get further into this game, but for now I am giving this game the following scores:  Value: 32/40 ; Fun: 25/30 ; Controls & Bugs: 20/20 ; Graphics & Sound 8/10.\n...This adds up to a very impressive 85% score and for its early access launch day, that is an impressive score that will likely only get better and better is more stuff is added and fleshed out in its development.\n\nIf you like this kind of game, I'd say it's a MUST BUY... for everyone else, just consider what style of game you like and keep in mind that multiplayer isn't complete yet (at the time of this review), but it's a really fun casual game.","February 24","true","2.5"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","9","15","0","0"

The game is subject to major change, so please check out their update page on the Steam community.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSteam is a popular breeding ground for a variety of games that are currently in development known as Early Access. Some of these are extremely popular and are great fun to play. Most, however, are terrible – there are games that should not be being sold on a storefront, and there are games that just never get finished with development as the developer runs with the cash. Where does The Kindred stand? I’m pleased to say that I have been have been getting immense enjoyment out of playing this, and I hope that the game can only improve as it gets further into development. Persistent Studios have been working on The Kindred for 3 years before bringing it to Early Access, I feel like this game is a good example of what Early Access should really be about.\n\nYou must have either played or heard of Minecraft at some point? When you look at The Kindred you will be quick to see the similarities between the two games. I like to think of The Kindred as a cross between Minecraft and Banished. Your job in the game is to manage a group of voxel people called the Kin, they live in a voxel world surrounded by pretty flowers and large lakes. However, the Kin cannot function without you managing them and giving them tasks to do. You, as their God, must make sure that they have a place to live with enough food to suffice (none of this is actual ‘lore’ in the game, you are not their God – I just like to play the game thinking that I am)\n\nCurrently you start off with 6 Kin that you need to care for. As the game is in Early Access, there is no reproduction – so do not bother trying to set them up with each other, it won’t work – I’ve tried. Your first step would be to make sure that they have a place to sleep and food to eat. This means that you need to go and chop down some trees or mine some stone, and set up some farms. The map will randomly generate as you initially start the game (You can also enter in a ‘Seed’ code, so feel free to share yours around the internet, or take someone else’s if you think their starting map looks good). Dotted around the map you will find ores and plants/vegetables. There should be one of each vegetable that you can harvest, from there you can cultivate them and grow more and more, thus getting food for your Kin.\n\nUsing a small selection of tools and objects, you can build your dream world. Although, with the current amount of objects your dream world will be very limited. You can create a crafting bench, a dairy machine and even a kiln. Being an Early Access game, there is an extremely limited amount you can do on The Kindred. I have played the game for 17 hours at the time of writing this review, and I can safely say that I have built every item that the game has to offer. For me, 17 hours is a large amount of time to spend on a game and have a blast constantly. It is very rare that a video game will keep me entertained for 100% of the time, but that is mainly due to how relaxing The Kindred is to play. You know what makes this even better? Knowing that there is always more content on the horizon.\n\nThe 17 hours that I spent have been on multiple maps, as I have had to restart my map a few times to try to get the patches working (Again, it is Early Access), have just been building up a farm and getting all the items I will need. I have yet to start working on some amazing architectural wonders, but that is mainly down to how awkward and time-consuming building structures is. Building a square building that is 6 X 6 with a roof, door, window and a nice window plant for each of my Kin took a very long time. I had to cut down a bunch of trees, and then I wanted to use the crafting bench to turn these into planks so that they looked a bit prettier than just using the standard logs. My Kin are a lazy bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and just seem to take forever to complete the build queue, this makes building a large building out of the same material a task that I just cannot be bothered to currently do. What doesn’t help is that when I want to do some farming with one of the Kin that is just standing around doing nothing, all the others that were building will come and ‘help’ with the farming (Work allocation is something that is being added into an unstable beta version of the game).\n\nI’ve played many Early Access games, and they are going to have lots of bugs, that even goes for AAA games. The Kindred is quite low on major bugs that I have seen reported in the forums, and I have encountered only a few. The staff at Persistent Studios are easy to approach in the forums of by email with any big requests and are extremely friendly and helpful, they have fixed a number of bugs that I and other people have found and reported. There is still some things that definitely need to be fixed, such as Kin just idling around and doing nothing when there is a large queue of things to actually get on with – this bug has been worked on and has been made better, although a better fix is on the way. I’ve also had some problems with Kin just falling down large holes and then dying of Starvation (which I didn’t notice about until it was too late, much too late. You will be remembered, whatever your name was). The FPS seems to dip down quite frequently to the 45 range when rotating the camera or panning around the screen – but this does not have as much of a bad impact as it is a slow-paced strategy game.\n\nThe Kindred is one of a small amount of Early Access games that I would recommend to anyone that enjoys relaxing to small town management game. With the craze of everyone making terrible voxel games, it is always wonderful to find a game that is a joy to play and an honour to the genre.  If you are the type of person that needs lots of content in a game, probably best to hold off until the game is out of Early Access. I strongly believe that the game has enough content to justify the current price tag, and although I have done everything that the game currently has to offer, there is still plenty of hours I can sink into the game by making my town look the best. By looking at the development roadmap, you can see that Persistent Studios has a vision of how they want the game to be later on down the line, and I cannot wait to see all these features come into the game. The Kindred is the perfect game sit down and help you relax. Put on some music, your favourite podcast, or even a movie and cut down some trees and build a fort.","March 9","true","19.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"
