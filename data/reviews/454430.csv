Or if you would like to keep your sanity id say avoid this.\n\nI do state this as someone who did finish it and it isnt the worst game but i feel whatever engine they used ate my inputs way too many times that it was hard to enjoy the game.\n\nSure if you got it as a game in a bundle its fine but i couldnt recommend anyone buying this for full price or even close to full price.","May 19","false","4.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I've gotten through a small chunk of the game, and I quite liked what I saw so far. It's pretty well polished, too.","May 19","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Your goal in each stage is to collect blue and green, my eyes saw these as orange, chips. By pressing buttons you alternate which ones you can collect and which ones will kill you if you touch them.\n\nThere are three flaws, you can't go backwards once you select a world, you can't tell which levels you have beat.\nLook at my time played, that is how long it took me to beat the game using the third flaw of the game. If you don't want to play all the levels choose the 10th level of each world and beat it to go to the next world.","May 22","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
