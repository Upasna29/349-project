Ive read a few other reviews here, and the negatives bring up a couple valid points. There is very little handholding. They expect you to google to learn the concepts, then do the exercise in all but the most simple puzzles at the start. The game is more like a question booklet rather than a textbook, so you are solving problems not learning the material you need to solve problems. If you have some programming background and need a referesher on assembly, or if you know programming and want to try your hand at some assembly type problems without actually doing assembly code.... this game could be useful and entertaining. But if you are looking to LEARN, this game will not teach you very well. You will need to do the learning else where and come back to this as an exercise.\n\nAs an exercise, its good and I reccomend it. As a learning tool, I do not reccomend it.

I like programming games. Human Resource Machine was... okay. I like the graphics, I like that one can add comments and labels, and I like the music. But let's talk about the core gameplay: the puzzles.\n\nThe puzzles are pretty simple for the most part, with the exception of the side-branches (which are nicely hard, and optional), and the final puzzle, which is literally a second-year computer science exercise in writing a sort algorithm in assembler. It's rather a big leap from all the other puzzles you've been working on. It would make a great side-branch challenge, but it's a rather brutal challenge for a typical player.\n\nIf you've got a programming background, you can knock the main branch (and "win the game") in about 3-4 hours, which means the content feels a bit lacking. If you don't have a programming background, the last puzzle will be crushingly hard, which means endless frustration when you can't win the game. This leaves Human Resource Machine not well-placed for *either* audience. I'd love to say the storyline makes up for this, but unfortunately it doesn't.\n\nInstead of playing Human Resource Machine, I would recommend:\n\n- TIS-100, if you've got a programming background. It's *very* well done.\n- SpaceChem, regardless of your background. It has lots of challenges and will really make you think.\n- Little Inferno, if you don't want a programming game at all, but do want an awesome story from Tomorrow Corporation.\n\nMaybe grab this if it's on sale, but try one of the games above first instead of paying full-price.","May 10","false","3.3"," 107 of 137 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","107","137","3","9"

In HR Machine you’re presented with tasks to complete and in order to complete said tasks you need to program your little office worker to complete whatever steps need to be taken in order to complete it. As you’d expect the puzzles get harder as you progress through the game but they’re not exactly easy to begin with, making this one of the most challenging games I’ve come across.\n\nI’ve never done any kind of programing before and while the game is very good at explaining how to do it within the game it is still pretty tough to wrap your head around. If you do have programing experience you may find it slightly easier but there are bonus levels along the way to test the best!\n\nPresentation\nHR Machine brings back the style that Little Inferno and World of Goo had and as expected it looks great and fits perfectly with the game. There’s not much else to say about this other than the fact that it’s a great looking game. All the models are good, the UI is clean, simple and easy to use as is the menu.\n\nGameplay\nManagement is watching.\n\nStarting the game with two different commands you’ll gradually work your way up to eleven different commands, making up a simple language. Using this language you’ll program your little office worker to complete tasks set by the management. Each task has its own floor, completing the task will earn you a promotion to the next floor and a harder task to complete. While the main objective is of course to complete each task, the management are also looking to see how many commands you use and how many steps it takes for you to complete the task. While these aren’t tied to progression they add an extra challenge if you wish to push yourself though it’s not always possible to complete them both in one program.\n\nThe tasks set are of a wide variety but they always involve taking items (numbers at the beginning but letters are introduced later on) from the inbox and then manipulating them somehow before moving them to the outbox. Some tasks involve taking items from the inbox before subtracting them from the next item in the inbox, some involve multiplying a number by itself x number of times etc.\n\nAll of the levels with tasks have spaces on the floor where you can copy inbox items to/from. These are used in pretty much all of the tasks in order to manipulate the items or swap their order etc.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier there are bonus tasks which provide a challenge for even the best programmers! The different tasks are displayed as what looks like an elevator floor control. Every so often you’ll come across a branch that breaks away from the rest of the levels, generally about four or five levels. The tasks given to you on these levels are incredibly challenging, I found the regular tasks mind numbing but these take it to a whole new level of mind numbingness! So whether you’re a programming wizard or a complete newcomer there’s something here to get your grey matter going.\n\nAudio\nAudio is great across the board for HR Machine. The music fits nicely with the game and it’s reasonably subtle so it doesn’t steal the show from the game itself. Sound effects are also fitting and sound pretty good.\n\nMiscellaneous While it’s definitely not the main point of the game, HR Machine does have a storyline running through it which is rather amusing and provides a nice occasional break from the game itself.\nHR Machine features forty-two levels, enough to keep you going for quite some time though not all of the levels have tasks to complete, six of the levels are coffee breaks, i.e. the levels where you’re presented with the story.\nReally the only thing I didn’t like about HR Machine is that it’s pretty difficult to write out the comments. Comments are unlocked a few levels in and allow you to split up your code (you can also label spots on the floor later on) but they have to be ‘hand-written’ with the mouse, personally I would have preferred to just type them.\nYou’re able to run your program step-by-step which is incredibly helpful for fine tuning it as well as weeding out any issues with it to correct them.\nVerdict\nEssential Purchase.\n\nHuman Resource Machine is a truly fantastic puzzle-based programing game with a charming aesthetic and challenging puzzles. If you’re a fan of puzzle games or just like a good challenge, do yourself a favour and buy this game.\n\nReview Copy Provided.\n\nNo drama, Just Reviews.\n\nEl K.","October 15, 2015","true","3.9"," 73 of 89 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","73","89","3","2"

That's the sad thing about loving your work. The idea of pretending to do my day job inside a video game and in my spare time excites me...\n\nOf course, I was wrong. Human Resource Machine is a low-level programming puzzle game with a few HR and performance management jokes thrown in along the way. You pick an employee and "code" their workflow to automate a particular job, and with each level it becomes messier and more complex. Most frustrating of all are the optimisation challenges, which force you to rethink and rewrite solutions which may work perfectly on their own, but falter when it comes to "efficiency".\n\nIt gets tough quite quickly, and as someone who dropped Maths at school as soon as I was allowed to, I was often left stumped. Luckily, my intermediate knowledge of PHP/Javascript helped a little, and the game does a good job of introducing new commands one by one, so there is a great feeling of progression as you pick up new concepts and techniques. Despite the difficulty, it's ridiculously fun and somewhat educational.\n\nMy only negative comment would be that the UI is a little clunky, forcing you to scroll up and down if you have over 15 lines of code (zoom functions would be a great addition) and hand-draw notes rather than type. However, the developers have cleverly added in the ability to copy and paste code within the game as well as in into external programs like Notepad, for those who like to get down to the nitty-gritty.\n\nAs expected from the creators of World of Goo and Little Inferno, the music and graphics are delightful, and whilst there isn't so much of a storyline going on behind the scenes, the gameplay is captivating and very rewarding.\n\nHRM combines three of my passions - HR, code and video games, and it does so fantastically. A truly unique game - especially worth picking up if you have programming experience, and if you don't, why not start here?","October 21, 2015","true","5.8"," 49 of 53 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","49","53","4","3"

The puzzles start out easy enough for people new to programming, but quickly grow increasingly complex, to the point where I doubt people without programming experience will be able to complete some of the later puzzles without help of some sort. Not because the puzzles are overly difficult, but rather because they lack the proper problem-solving mindset that a long-time programmer has. Overall, a fantastic puzzle game. Humor is on point as always, music is fantastic, artwork and animation is great, and even the voice acting is good.\n\nI'm mostly making this review because I see some reviews that say this game has little replayability. My guess is these people have not attempted the OCDs for each level, which are basically size/speed code optimization. These are fantastic, and often delve deeply into what algorithm you use for each puzzle, and require you to squeeze every last line of code possible out of each program. As a long-time programmer (about 9 years), I found these to be a great mental exercise, and would heartily recommend to any programmer who is interested in optimizing code. 30 hours in and I've completed all but two of the OCDs, so I'd say there's a lot of replayability here, as playing through the game itself only took about 10 hours.","October 18, 2015","true","32.6"," 38 of 40 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","38","40","2","0"

I am a programmer IRL with a passion for both: getting people into the field younger, and also raising awareness of how programming concepts are applicable beyond the very limited scope layment are aware of. Ergo, I am always excited to try programming-themed games, and when I saw that the makers of Little Inferno had come out with a new game, I snatched it up no questions no research.\n\nSo here's the thing. I love trying programming themed games. I hate nearly every one of them. Nearly every one of them overbearingly forces pithy metaphors on you, and struggles to find a balance between infantile dumbing-down and overcomplicated concepts that don't lend themselves to the interface. Human Resource Machine has leapt straight to the top of my list for ability to convey programming concepts.\n\nIt's not perfect. The language is little more than the lowest-level assembly, which can raise the opacity of the puzzles for newcomers. As a programmer I am reaching the point where I desperately wish I could create subroutines, if only for jnez! And there are some nuances to the way the game calculates the number of actions your program requires that can lead to unintuitive changes required to hit the optimization goals - not to mention that neither of the optimization goals are actually realistic methods of optimization.\n\nBut so far I am enjoying the game, and would absolutely recommend it to anyone who has a little experience to basic programming and is looking for a casual game.","October 18, 2015","true","15.9"," 28 of 29 people (97%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","97","28","29","2","2"

It has the same quirky look and feel of World of Goo (by the same developers), and a very nice streamlined interface. The game starts you off with simple puzzles to help you get to grips with the basics, and gradually ramps up the difficulty until you get to the point where you look at every puzzle saying: "Surely this is impossible, how the hell am I meant to solve this!?"\n\nWhile this game is challenging, you'll eventually find sollutions to every puzzle with a bit of patience and head-scratching. It also gives you that feeling of satisfaction that all great puzzles games leave you with after solving a puzzle. There's nothing like coming up with an elegant sollution to a problem that seemed unsolvable.\n\nAt 10$ this one is well worth the full price! I bought a razor yesterday that was more expensive than this game. So my consumer advice is keep your beard and buy this game, that way you'll have a fun afternoon and you can stroke your magnificent beard while you're trying to figure out how to solve the  more difficult puzzles.\n\nP.S. For the record I'm not a hardcore programmer, although I've certainly dabbled with programming at various points in my life. That said, for me the appeal of this game lies in solving logic puzzles and I would have probably enjoyed it irrespective of how closely (or not) it resembles actual programming.","October 16, 2015","true","7.1"," 34 of 42 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","34","42","4","0"

The puzzles are satisfying, the visuals and music are captivating, and the writing keeps you interested until the very end. The gameplay is essentially a simulation of a simple computer. You are given a set of instructions of what to output at each level, and a collection of commands to create a program that accomplishes this. While the late game does get fairly complex, you are weaned into it one concept at a time from the very basics. The base story sits at a reasonable difficulty, but World of Goo players won't be surprised to hear that 100% completion is fiendishly difficult.\n\nWhile the theme of the gameplay might seem unappealing or too unfamiliar to people who aren't experienced in programming, I would say that the presentation sits at a perfect medium; everything is set up in a way that anybody can enjoy the main game regardless of experience, but the challenge of the optional levels and optimization challenges remains for skilled programmers and completionists alike.","October 16, 2015","true","7.0"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","22","23","0","0"

Most problems are known problems that are easy google-able (which the game even reminds you of). Google fibonacci and you will see what I mean.\n\nNow the biggest question though: is it fun for anyone that isn't a complete geek?

The sub-command for example substracts the value in the box you chose from the value you are currently holding, But it doesn't change the value of the box it self, so you have to save it manually afterwards.\nIf you take the bump -1 command instead the box value is reduced by -1 and you pick said value up at the same time.\n\nYou get used to it, but it is annoying the first time you try to make a programm and the thing doesn't work because the commands act differently from what you expect.","October 24, 2015","true","4.9"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","16","16","0","0"

Other than that, the gameplay is really simple and the problems not that hard. Beating the efficiency challenges can however be excruciating.\n\nTechnically speaking, however, the game is an obscenely bad PC port and for a game with programming as a concept, it's pathetic that Tomorrow Corporation has released the game as is. We can only hope they get their s.h.i.t. together and release a patch that turns this into a proper PC game.\n\nSure the game runs fine and stable, but these are extremely basic things that are required for releasing anything on PC:\n\n- The game lacks every form of settings menu. There are no volume sliders, no resolution/graphics settings, no way to adjust the audio levels or mute the menu music whatsoever. This is basic stuff that needs to be in every game and releasing a game without is sheer incompetence.  This needs to be fixed.\n- On Windows the game defaults to borderless window, which is fine for most people, but then it positions itself on top of everything else, which is bad and makes it pointless to run in a window in the first place.  This needs to be fixed.\n- The game refuses to be minimized. You can force it minimized by dropped to the Desktop, but as soon as you then go into another program it maximizes itself again. Again, this needs to be fixed.\n- Hitting Alt+Enter will force the game into regular windowed mode, which is the only way to keep the game from burying everything else you have running. It's also the only way to get into the audio mixer to turn down the game's volume (which you wouldn't have to if it was made properly).\n- Completely lacks keyboard support. Yet it has the ability to make labels and comments, without accepting keyboard input (yes, you can draw crap, but even on touch devices that's obnoxious). This is inexcusable and needs to be fixed. Pretty sure the tablet version doesn't support keyboard either, which just doubles up how bad that design decision is.\n\nOther than that, the game runs at a solid 60 fps, the audio is way too loud (even at 15% it's really loud), it has the same cutesy style as Tomorrow Corporation's previous games, and it is fun for the few hours it lasts (frustration included).","November 7, 2015","true","10.5"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","0"

The game does a decent job of introducing instructions (the gameplay mechanics), but does get quite challenging later on.  I like that they include some background information about the programming principles that the challenges are built on (enough to turn around and then Google the concept; indeed, some in-game dialogue even encourages you to do so, but not necessary).  Optional levels and optimization challenges provide something for those who want more (and I do recommend taking them on).  The tone and style of the presentation and narrative will be familiar to fans of the team's previous games ;).  The option to edit your code in an external editor is nice as well, and proves useful for the motivated.\n\n\nNITPICKS:\nI would call these more nitpicks, as opposed to true "cons", as they seem to be mostly design choices.  For example, the UI is a bit blown-up -- likely to make it easier for touch screens, and perhaps to give it a wider appeal (which I think is great, so ultimately a worthy concession).  Working with many lines of code can get a but cumbersome when not working externally (perhaps there could be options for collapsing/moving the instructions for each level).\n\nTL;DR:\nDefinitely recommended for fans of the genre, but do be aware it's core gameplay is very different from Little Inferno or World of Goo, despite the somewhat cutesy signature art style.  If you're not sure about the genre, this is probably one of the most accessible and beginner-friendly I've seen.","November 1, 2015","true","10.8"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","15","16","2","0"

Ergo, I love logic puzzles.\n\nHuman Resource Machine is a cleverly hidden bit of education disguised as a fun puzzle game, teaching players just what exactly it is that computers do billions of times a second nowadays.\n\nYour little employee avatar is tasked to program him/herself into taking whatever sequence of data is given and sending out whatever the current function is.  Can't do that directly, though, you have to program yourself using the most rudimentary commands: get an input, put whatever you're holding into a carpet memory cell, add, subtract, send out whatever you're holding, jump somewhere else in your program, among others.\nIt reminds me of an assembly-language course I took in college, but don't let that intimidate.  The interface is simple drag-and-drop, and you watch (and can step-trace) your little guy following your program in every detail, even when things go wrong.  Especially when things go wrong.\n\nBut make sure you do your own work.  Much of the satisfaction comes from a good debugging.  And if that's not enough, bonuses are given for optimizing program length and/or runtime.\n\nIf you want to learn a bit of programming logic, play this game.\nIf you like a challenging series of puzzles, play this game.\nIf you are going to give up at the first sign of trouble and look up the answers, don't bother.\n\nThe little bits of humor reflect on the setting's absurdity, and the atmospheric music I found soothing.

It is a visual programming environment. The goal of the game seems to teach people how to think like a programmer, and I think it does an admirable job at that. It manages to make players visualize what a variable is, how to create ordering in your commands, why runtime errors occur, and how to test and debug.\n\nI have some misgivings, though.\n\nFirst, there is little fun in the game, except the fun of solving a programming puzzle. The people for whom this program is most useful, will hardly find any fun in that.\n\nSecond, the language the game uses is GOTO-based, and it isn't for nothing that GOTOs have been more or less banned from programming languages in the past 40 years. They make a program completely unreadable and unmaintainable, and that is exactly what happens with this game.\n\nThird, it is ridiculous that only about 15 lines of code will fit on the screen. A zoom function that would allow you to see more of your program if you want is sorely missed.\n\nFourth -- and this is the most important complaint that I have --, the OCD challenges are unfitting for this game. You can try to create a program in the least amount of memory space, but memory space is no concern of modern computers. You can try to create a program that uses the least number of cycles, but speed is no issue for modern computers and compilers optimize well anyway. By adding these OCD challenges, the designers make the player focus on those things which are least important in programming. When I teach people programming (and that is part of my job) I want them to write readable, maintainable code, and not create an unreadable mess because it is 10% faster.\n\nI'd like to use this game as a teaching tool for beginners, to get them to think like programmers before delving into the arcane mysteries of a modern computer language. I wish I could get a version without the OCD challenges. And perhaps a version with real loops instead of these jumps with conditions.\n\nStill, I recommend the game -- though not as a form of entertainment, but as a teaching tool.","October 19, 2015","true","15.2"," 19 of 27 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","19","27","3","2"

There is something ingenious about how TIS-100 encourages you to learn all important tools (except stack memory, I guess) and sets you free to use all of them from the very first puzzle. In comparison, Human Resource Machine feels more "gamey", with clearer restrictions and a gradual introductions of tools.\n\nIn conclusion, I would still recommend this game for fans of the increasingly popular programming puzzle genre, and possibly also for fans of World of Goo and Little Inferno.

You instruct your character to perform simple tasks by writing instructions in a language that's like assembly (machine) code. The tasks begin extremely easy, so you can get the hang of writing this code, and get much more complex as about halfway through the game. As a bonus, you can attempt to meet length and efficiency of execution goals for each task, and there are bonus tasks which are very hard. There is a plot here but it's treat like an afterthought, or a bit of downtime between packs of levels.\n\nI think the game is extremely fun, especially if you're a programmer or interesting in exploring programming. I had a great time with it up until the last maybe 5 levels, out of 42 main levels. I also played a few of the bonus levels, and I had a good time optimizing the majority of the levels that I played. My problems are:\n* You can't type code labels, you have to draw them with your mouse.\n* These label system sucks, and there's no white space or code hiding. This all makes longer programs MUCH harder to read.\n* All code must be written by dragging copies of commands into place. No typing.\n* A few levels have no good explanation of the concept being used. It's almost as if this game, or these specific levels, was written ONLY for programmers/math nerds.\n\nThose are minor issues until the levels get really complex.

You get to program your little guy to do all kinds of things using the commands the game game gives you. You can do anything from basic inbox to outbox all the way to crazy infinite mathmatical loops.

The game dosen't need it's own storyline, the story is built into the gameplay, which works very, very well for a game that's all programming.\n\nIf you are really looking for a story I'd recommend Tomorrow Corp.'s  "Little Inferno"  which does have a sweet little story attached to it.\n\nArtstyle:\nKeeping it classing Tomorrow Corp. stuck to their usual rough drawn-like artstyle. Like in their other 2 games, it looks as lovely as ever. The game looks really nice, taking the wacky fun Tomorrow Corp. models we love and mixing it with a clean, colourful UI. Vibrant colours and shapes everywhere all the way from the programming buttons to the floor tiles.\n\nSoundtrack:\nDespite the slight creepiness of the game (See: "Gameplay") the game has a upbeat, happy soundtrack like all other Tomorrow Corp. games. In my opinion not being  as  good as Little Inferno's soundtrack, the game's OST is still really sweet and quiet adorable.\n\nPerformance:\nObviously the game runs at a smooth 60 FPS no matter what's going on since the requirements are basiclly any computer past the year 2005 even if it isn't built for gaming. I still note performance because it's really important to know no matter what game it is.\n\nAdditonal Notes:\n- The game dosen't have a crazy large amout of levels but they take ages to beat so it shouldn't matter that much.\n- Extremely frustrating, not saying it's a good or a bad thing, just leaving a note of it.\n- Your boss for each floor tells you what the output is suppose to look like, so you know how  beat  the level, just not how to solve it.\n\nSummary:\nIt's fun, it's frusting, it makes me feel stupid, but it's loveable and most importantly it's really, really great. Highly recommended.\n\nRating: 8.5/10.\n\nReview key provided by developer but does not change my opinion about the game in any way.\n\nFor more reviews like this, check out my curation page  here!","October 15, 2015","true","3.8"," 20 of 32 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","20","32","0","0"

All the stuff it teaches you is actually applicable to the real world, yet the puzzles are done in a fun way. There's nothing more satisfying than scratching your head at a puzzle, shouting at the screen that it's impossible, only to solve it in the next 5 minutes and feeling like a God. That is also a taste of what programming feels like.\n\nThere are a few optional challenges in levels which encourage you to optimize your programs so that you use less commands, or complete the task in fewer steps. Even that, is a useful skill the game helps you learn for real programming.\n\nAs you progress, you unlock new commands that you can incorporate into your program, as well as labels to remember what some sections you've created are. Within each level, you even have a few pages to work through, in case you want to try out a new program to solve the task, but don't want to scrap your current one in case you want to go back to it. The UI is also very easy to use. Everything is streamlined and reacts the way you'd expect it to.\n\nI love the world the game is set in as well.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/375820/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","IntroductionBy simply taking a look at the screenshots you’ll know exactly who is behind this seemingly-casual-but-still-harder-than-expected puzzle/programming game: the Tomorrow Corporation! Better known as the developers of Little Inferno and World Of Goo. Is Human Resource Machine (HRM) just as brilliant as those games or is it maybe even better? Or, God forbid…*gulp* worse?\n\nGameplayLet me reassure you: HRM is absolutely great. It might not necessarily be better than their previous games, but I enjoyed this just as much (and at times even a bit more), but it’s still a unique game that tries to teach you the basics of programming. It can be fun for actual programmers and people who have never even attempted it before, although it speaks for itself that it will be more challenging for this group.\n\nYou start at the bottom of the company, where the level number is relative to your years in service of the company. It starts off rather linear with only one way to go up, but after level six you can choose to play more advanced puzzles, and these branch off the otherwise linear path. These are usually more difficult versions of the levels you’ve already played and they are entirely optional.\nThere seem to be 33 levels, by the way, and this is excluding the optional puzzles. In total there are around 44 levels.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=531839482\nThe first few puzzles can be solved with relative ease, but the game always wants you to use your brain. You might make some progress by just trying things. You might even be able to finish a few levels this way, but ultimately things just become too complex. If you haven’t paid attention to the game’s mechanics then you’re going to have a hard time finishing it.\nThe learning curve is good; you’ll start off with the absolute basics and then just work your way through the levels, gaining more and more functions as you go. There are 11 functions in total and these functions will apparently simulate most of a computer’s algorithm, which I was actually unaware of. You learn something new every day!\n\nYou can start and stop a puzzle, fast-forward as well take steps backward and forward. The sound can be muted in the level itself and there are also buttons to delete, copy and undo functions and use three sheets. You also have a clear button that removes all of your used functions so that you can quickly start over again. This is sometimes more useful than just rearranging everything and also gives a better overview if things are not going your way.\n\nIf you’re looking for more advanced programming puzzles then I’m sorry to have to disappoint you. Even casual gamers can eventually finish this game with a little patience. And to be honest, I don’t think the game would’ve been as fun if the puzzles would’ve been even more difficult. If you want advanced programming lessons then I suggest you go read a book or follow a training course.\nIn fact, I think that there will be plenty of players who might want to give programming a try after having played this, either as a hobby or a study/job.\n\nWhere I normally don’t get a sense of accomplishment whenever I manage to solve a tough puzzle, in HRM this is a completely different story. Solving the puzzles felt rewarding and great. I felt… smart. That’s not normally a feeling I get when I play games. It’s maybe because these are logical (to-the-point) puzzles whereas other puzzles usually require a bit trial-and-error gameplay because things aren’t always clear(ly explained) and are shown in an entirely different context, relative to the game’s story and atmosphere. And no, this doesn’t apply to *all* puzzle games, of course.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=531839455\nAfter finishing a puzzle you will be shown a results screen (called Optimization Challenges) that shows you have many steps (speed) and functions (size) you should have used and how many you used to actually finish the level. Since sometimes you can do (much) better this is a good incentive to go and replay a level. Plus, you will ultimately learn to program more efficiently this way. And the levels are also usually just a few minutes long (and previous attempts are saved you when exit the level), which is another kind of bonus I guess.\n\nAudio & VisualsWith such a relaxing game you will need relaxing audio as well, right? You are absolutely correct and thankfully the music that has been implemented suits the game well. It remains in the background and doesn’t become the focus of attention. Other than that there are some relatively basic sound effects: similar to the sound effects used in their previous games.\n\nThe visuals of HRM are instantly recognizable as Tomorrow Corporation’s work. There’s no doubt about it: the weird looking big lipped and/or big eyed characters and the brownish color palette. It’s all part of the developer’s famous art style. Everything looks stylish and sharp, the animations are done well, although the animations in general are quite limited. But then again, this isn’t a game about the visuals, but about the gameplay. The graphics are there so you know you’re dealing with a game here, but underneath it all is actually a basic programming tool. One that has just been dressed up.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=531839406\nLength/Replay ValueFortunately there are more than enough puzzles to be solved. There are 44 levels in total and while they start off by showing you the absolute basics the difficulty will increase not long after you have started. Add to this the optional, more advanced puzzles and you should be able to finish it in 10-30 hours. All of this naturally depends on your current programming knowledge and intelligence, though (hence the big gap).\n\nConclusionThey have done it again: the people of Tomorrow Corporation have managed to surprise me once more. HRM has become a beautiful, little educative game that shows everyone can have fun programming… as long as it’s a little dressed up.\nI’ve had tons of fun playing it, even if it’s at times frustratingly hard/difficult/complex. But try to keep going, though, it’s worth it for the feeling of accomplishment alone.\nIn any case, I suggest you add this to your cart right now and press that big ‘Buy’ button immediately. Trust me!*\n\n(*Just don’t hold me responsible if you end up not liking the game ;))\n\nToo long, didn’t readPros:\n+ Famous Tomorrow Corporation art style\n+ You’ll learn the basics of programming in a fun, but still challenging way\n+ Plenty of puzzles\n+ Optional, advanced puzzles\n+ Optimization Challenges make you want to do better and be more efficient\n\nMixed:\n+/- If you want to learn/know more about advanced programming functions you will have to look further\n\nCons:\n- Even though it has a good difficulty curve it may still prove too difficult for people with little or no interest in PC's (e.g. casual users).\n\nPlease note: a Steam key for this game was provided by the developer/publisher.\nRating: 8.5 (out of 10)(Ratings aren’t calculated based on a formula, but on my personal feelings)\n\n\nPlease feel free to join my group, DJ’s reviews, or follow me directly as a curator.\nDon’t feel like it?

It starts out extremly simple to introduce you to the concept. It then slowly increases the complexity to levels you would not believe.\n\nThe cool thing: It is completely new. Like your first time playing Portal, you have to figure everything out yourself from the ground up.\n\nAdapting to youThese puzzle games sometimes manage to leave you behind or don't progress quickly enough for you. Human Resource Machine comes with optional branches of difficult puzzles based on ideas you solved in the main branch.\n\nYou are also motivated to go back and optimize your puzzles with two goals. Faster execution or small instruction count. Both are extreme opposites and feel very different to work towards.\n\nEducationalYou will never see programming like this. This game teaches you nothing practical.\n\nAnd that's the point. Like Portal it tries to introduce you to something completely fresh and unheard of, forcing you to rethink how to solve the simplest problems.\n\nStoryThere is no story. It is a puzzle game with the occasional short cut-scene teasing that something is happening in this world but you won't care. Characters are cute though.\n\nVerdictAnyone can start playing this game and enjoy it. It does require you to follow along as it ramps up the difficulty. It doesn't progress too quickly and offers optional challenging puzzles to accommodate all.\n\nCompletion time is somewhere at 8h.

I can see why it would be sort of hit or miss for people who do program.\n\nI'm struggling a bit but I don't feel totally out of my depth. It's definitely forcing me to think differently, and I think in a more logical fashion. The puzzles progress well, so you don't feel totally unprepared for each level.\n\nIf you can, avoid looking up exact answers to each level - you'll only feel more and more lost as puzzles progress. Sometimes it helps to ask for a bit of help - I couldn't figure out on my own how to do multiplication with just addition available to me. A hint from someone who knows more than me helped, and I was able to construct something on my own from there.\n\nDo I feel like I'm learning about programming? Not really. I think maybe going from no knowledge to this game is a step in the right direction, but I doubt this is a good primer for much of anything other than very general concepts.\n\nI'm only about halfway through at roughly seven hours, but I've read that people with more experience do breeze through quickly.\n\nThe art and music are similar to other games from the devs, though the music isn't quite as good as I'm used to.\nI'm seeing hints of a story here and there, and look forward to seeing where it goes. I'm going to guess it's on par with Little Inferno (which was somewhat weak to begin with).\n\nControls are kind of awkward. You  have to write on your labels via mouse and not keyboard. Some folks in the forums can point you to places where you can implement text into the labels, but I'm not quite inconvenienced enough to take extra steps. Sometimes I find myself meaning to pause and instead selecting 'stop' (there is no 'pause'), which resets the input so you have to run through all over again and make double sure you hit the 'back' or 'forward' buttons if you want to go line-by-line before hitting an error, at which point you are given the option to debug line-by-line. Any alterations to the code also reset the inbox, so you can't see exactly what your modification would have done with the original variables you had been working with.\n\nFor ten bucks, if you're either into logic puzzles with no programming experience, or experienced but cool with liberties being taken and what probably seem like arbitrary restraints, it's a good buy.","October 23, 2015","true","91.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This is done by dragging and dropping commands that direct the worker to perform certain "programming functions". While the game doesn't really teach you any actual programming, it does a good job teaching programming concepts and makes it easy enough for people without programming experience to understand.\n\nWhile the early levels are pretty easy, the later levels can get quite challenging especially for people without experience programming. The puzzles are pretty interesting but you need to think like a programmer to solve a lot of them. This might be challenging for people who haven't programmed before. For people who have programmed before I would say that the game is moderately difficult.\n\nHaving some programming experience I actually had a lot of fun with the game. It is probably one of the best puzzle games that I have played recently. It has taken me around eight hours to complete all but one of the puzzles so the game is probably nine to ten hours long. With more programming experience you could take less time and with less experience it will likely take you longer.\n\nThe game won't be for everyone. If you have no interest in programming or puzzle games, you probably won't like Human Resource Machine. Otherwise I think you could really enjoy the game.\n\nNote: I received a free review copy of the game from the developer.\n\nRead My Full Review [www.geekyhobbies.com]\n","October 15, 2015","true","9.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

I like it, event when there are few tedious levels.\n\nLong answer: The middle part of the game was annoying a bit until all concepts were unlocked to be used. I would do few things differently, allow to change font sizes, allow type things on keyboard (you have to drag n drop everything, even comments you need to draw, can't type), or some shortcuts space for playing the simulation and [ ] to adjust speed would help. The visual jumps are nice when there is 3 of them, but when you have more of them they just annoy you. There is copy and paste and probably I enjoyed typing it manualy in other application and paste it back. I would allow CALL, RET instructions which would create routines / libaries, maybe allowing people carry over some libraries they made before. Now you have to start from scartch every time, one level checks for duplicates in memory, where the mem is already populated, next level is basicaly the same but you need to populate the memory yourself now. having nice common routines you could focus on problem solving and not the tedious work. What i enjoyed are the optimalisation parts a lot where you need to push limits of the architecture to the max. Definitely they should fix few things and create second game. I liked the backstory but was bit dark and maybe bit depresing for kids (but other games are much worse).\n\nDefinitely worth trying or even giving it to kids to experiment with coding.","May 7","true","6.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The player selects a list of actions that achieve a desired result.  For example, moving odd numbers from one side of a room to another or adding two numbers together and putting the result in the mail room's "outbox".  The concepts start fairly straightforward, but there are some particularly onerous (optional) challenges that make things interesting for the more experienced developers.  Most puzzles include at least 2 optimization challenges: use the least number of commands, and perform the task most efficiently.  I'm a programmer and I find some of these challenges difficult.\n\nThe ambiance captures a satirical heartless corporation filled with clueless managers and soul-crushing orders from the executives.  The mood is kept light with colorful and cute characters, despite the dreary brown office interior.

While it's pretty funny and thought provoking to run through 10 - 20 Jumps in for conditional programs, if you're learning programming this is not exactly efficient or even how programming is done.

Automation of each job is achieved through the use of simple one line commands which combine to to create a sequential programming language. This game is both a challenging puzzle game and a great way to help new programmers into the world of programming.\n\nPros     Challenging gameplay\nCute story\nReplayability in the form of optimizing your code.\nGreat music and sound, appropriate for the environment.\nSuper cute graphics.\nCons     Only uses sequential programming, where modern programming uses much more object oriented.\nVery logic based, definitely not everyones cup of tea for a puzzle game.\nWhile the music is great, there is very little variation in songs, so it can get a little repetitive.\nConclusion\nWhether you're new to the world of programming or a veteran coder this game is fun and offers varying levels of challenge for everyone. The  cute graphics, very "corporate" soundtrack and   relatively dark	 storyline all combine to create an amazing little game with a good amount of content for its price.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maingi/recommended/375820/","maingi","main_gi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maingi/","196 products in account","Okay, this is another 'negative' review I'll give that's just more or less neutral (Steam doesn't have a slider system). The main problem is that this game is outdated. I try to play the programming puzzle games I can find. However, I can usually find a sizable audience that would enjoy a game I *personally* dislike if they ignored or didn't mind a couple features.\n\nThis game, the "audiences" I can think of couldn't be more than a couple hundred. Basically, it is already outdone by other games in many, many different categories: length, accessibility, difficulty curve, concept conveying, design, debugging, feedback, efficiency, convenience, the list would probably break Steam's word count limit. And on its own rights, it still manages to be either mediocre or below on what it does.\n\nIf you're a newbie at programming, I recommend Jahooma's LogicBox for making many programming aspects convenient and less tedious. (These include better debugging control and instant feedback.) And if you're a newbie at programming like me, this is something you would really care about; assistance in some of the annoying aspects of programming. Which this game doesn't have.\n\nIf you want to learn programming concepts, it has more to show you. Here's what I can think of that would make you pick HRM over JLB: music, your personal preference of graphical style, minimal story, general knowledge, and comments/labels. Ask me anything!\n\nThe game itself is also as well designed as a free Flash game. If you're a newbie, the game has a really warped difficulty curve, and it constantly fails to get into detail to a lot of subjects the game attempts to cover. It is very frustrating to scroll through your "code" in this game, because the interface is so limited and your tools don't catch up, making your code look more and more like spaghetti. They really tried to push the "simplicity" so far the puzzles themselves got too complex and tedious to play.\n\nThe game's foundation itself is also weak. The different tests are non-rigorous, making the game seem very unpolished and easy to break. There was an opportunity to make a good story out of the game and really integrate it with the gameplay which would give it something unique, and it alluded to it, but never delivers. In addition, some design choices make the game _way_ too limited in terms of design space. Other optimization puzzlers are very free, but this one loves to deny a lot of creative solutions that were not considered during building the puzzle, so there are a lot less creative opportunities to solve in the game.\n\nSo basically, this game's main goal was a disaster.\n\nAs a second comparison, TIS-100 is a game I'm not too fond of, but I find enough a certain audience would like that makes me say that if you're someone who's played many programming puzzlers and wants more, that TIS-100 is a clear pick - its difficulty curve outdoes LB and the gameplay does not significantly differ from HRM besides the concurrency part. And you get like 10 times more playtime.\n\nI don't see where this game fits at all, and I'm torn on which it would have fit for. It's not unique. It's uninspired. It's not original. It's just so generic. It may have been good if it were the first in puzzle programmers, but this game came way too late. It's outdated and so unoriginal that if the devs came out and said they stole all the levels from other games, I would believe them; there are only like 3 original levels in the entire game.","October 20, 2015","false","11.8"," 16 of 29 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","16","29","0","0"

Even though many other reviews stated that it helps if you are accoustomed to actual programming, I would disagree. It's not really like any programming with actual programming languages like C or Java. It's enough to have a basic idea about how to break down a problem to many smaller steps and then compile these steps to an algorithm.\nIf you like these kinds of puzzles this game is for you!\nThis is why I bought the game, even though it is rather short compared to other games at the same price. That's why I would recommend buying it, when it's on sale.\n\nWhat is great about the game:\nThe artstyle is very unique as in most games by these devs.\nIt combines creativity with maths/programming. There are seemingly endless ways of solving a given puzzle.\nNeutral:\n\nThe game has a very dark theme, again a bit like "Little Inferno".\n\nHowever there is one big aspect of the game I was disappointed about:\n\nThe Story:\nI expected the story to be at least close to the story in "Little Inferno", but it wasn't. That is an aspect of the game where the developers really wasted potential. There is a story in "Human Resource Machine", which mainly consists of machines slowly taking over the world. But it's nowhere near as well told or thought through as I expected. I would have loved it if a story would be implemented like in "Papers Please" where you would get to see the newspapers headline before each level. In "Human Resource Machine" you only get short video clips every ten levels or so.\n\nSummary:\nThis game definitely isn't for everyone. I personally really enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone who likes these kinds of puzzles. You should note however that the game really doesn't consist of much more than these puzzles. I bought the game expecting a great story and was disappointed.\n\nRating: 6.5/10\nBuy it when it's on sale, if you're interested in the gameplay.","December 30, 2015","true","10.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Using a small set of rather basic commands, you have to perform a variety of tasks. The difficulty curve is well done; the game starts off really easy with little difficulty increase as it teaches you the various commands, but then cranks up the difficulty at a regular rate once it has taught you all of this. The regular puzzles are hard but in a sense that you shouldn't need a walkthrough and can probably figure them out yourself if you try hard enough, while the extra puzzles require some harder thinking.\n\nFor those that found the basic following of the game easy, each level has two challenges you can fulfil to get 100%. First, you must successfully carry out the objective with under a certain number of commands. For the other challenge, you must have your character complete the challenge following as few steps as possible. Whilst for the first load of levels, the solution to both of these challenges is usually the same (and often whatever solution you come up with), as the game progresses, some levels require a different solution to each of those challenges, and they require some extra thinking.\n\nOverall, this is a neat little puzzle game to anyone.

If that realization tickles some odd bone in your body and makes you cry for joy this game is definitly up your alley.\n\nTLDR:  If you lost conciousness or are currently drooling from boredom this may not be your flavor of puzzle game.","October 16, 2015","true","2.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

These opinions are my own.\nTomorrow Corporation is best known for both World of Goo and Little Inferno, and the storyline of Human Resource Machine screams of the mad minds behind these two gems.  Prepare yourself for a journey of ascension by playing an aging automaton with only a single purpose: Sorting.\n\nBy using simplistic logic, create complex and convoluted algorithms to complete the sorting tasks laid out before you, ranging from comparing numbers to compiling secret texts.  This game is focused on programming to complete the puzzles, so this will require additional thinking on the later levels.  If you have ever programmed, even at the most basic level with generic "If" statements, you can definitely pick up this game with ease.  Human Resource Machine moulds you into a star employee by introducing you to new concepts as the story progresses, allowing even beginners to progress (Though they may find the optional challenge paths tough!).\n\nEven if this game is simple enough for beginners, the game is very much flavoured and aimed at programmers or those with a knack for logic puzzles; there are quite a few subtle queues that could be overlooked as the game progresses in the game text, while not necessary to understand for solving the puzzles, they add to the game's charm and humour.\n\nBottom line, Human Resource Machine is fun if you love programming challenges of a mild nature; nothing too complex that may stump you for days, but could certainly put the brakes on for a half hour.","October 17, 2015","true","2.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The final task specifically was amazing once I got it running and my solution is horrendously unefficient, but I plan to go back and fix it later.\n\nThe only downside I can really mention is that once I got all of the ways to interact with the system, I was hoping for one or two more, especially functions so I could easily repeat code, mostly so it'd be tidier and not the horrible arrow filled mess half my solutions ended up being.\n\nI really recommend this game, especially for programmers looking for something to do that still keeps you in the right mindset.\n\n(Also the artstyle, writing and general humor of the game are fantastic as well, but the puzzles are what made me really enjoy this game.)","October 18, 2015","true","27.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You will learn interesting stuff. If you're grossed out by the thought of having to figure out how to find the rest of a division of two random numbers using only addition and substraction and basic logic, you should probably pass because you're not going to enjoy this game.\n\nIf you're a programmer and want to remember your old school days of learning basic sorting algorithms and/or assembly -> go for it! The levels aren't that hard to complete, but the challenges (code size requirements and execution time requirements for each level) will definitely have you rethink your solution and pull your hair trying to optimize as much as you can.\n\nThe only subjective thing is how much "fun" can you have writing programs and optimizing them within a game? There is nothing to "cover up" the fact that you are indeed sorting number chains and character strings, so if you're not having fun doing this, what's the point? The game atmosphere is very similar to other games from the same studio (world of goo, little infermo) and by that I mean that the story is very minimalistic and mysterious, and the humour is very cynical (you're basically working within the game).\n\nIt took me approx. 6 hours to complete the game and various challenges (I´m missing 30% of the latest levels challenges to be 100%), but it was definitely a fun experience that made me think back about basic logic and how difficult it is to perform operations like sorting that are very easy to do with higher level programming languages.

First off, people with basic programming skills will probably whiz though this game fairly quickly, I managed to finish 90% of the puzzles in one 5 hour sitting. Any real issues you'll end up facing is using your programming knowledge and implementing it into this games ui, which can be a little cumbersome at times.\n\nHowever, this game seems to be quite welcome to people who have never coded in their life. It teaches the basics steadily and in an easily understandable way, but I found the puzzle difficulty to ramp up maybe a little too fast. I watched a LPer have a crack at this game and started to really struggle at year 5, and just ended up quiting :C\n\nEach year has extra challenges too, and these are aimed at the highly skilled (at least the later years). It presents some extra diffculty to a puzzle if you're up for it. But as I said and the game itself states, this challenges are very hard, maybe a little too hard; as they require a very specific solution in a very flexible enviroment. It's quite difficult to "trim the fat" from coding normally, this game makes it an even more tedious task.\n\nOne other downside is the story. Normally I wouldn't complain about this as I prefer games with interesting mechanics over games with a detailed story (not that I don't enjoy them). But Human Resource Machine hasn't really tried all that hard. All you really get for story are brief cutscenes which most point to the "robots will replace humans" trope. While a fitting story for this game, it's not explored.... at all...\n\nOther than that, I nothing but good things to say about this game, awesome music, the "tomorrow corporation" artstyle and I've not encoutered any performance issues or crashes playing.\n\ntl;dr\n+ Interesting puzzle mechanic implemented well\n+ Awesome music (where's my downloadable soundtrack?)\n+ Great introduction to programming, or just to test your current skills in a neato enviroement\n- Lackluster story\n- UI can be cumbersome at times\n- Challenge requirements are too specific\n\n7/10","November 2, 2015","true","7.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Program little office workers to solve puzzles. Be a good employee! The machines are coming... for your job.\n\nHuman Resource Machine is a puzzle game for nerds. In each level, your boss gives you a job. Automate it by programming your little office worker. If you succeed, you'll be promoted up to the next level for another year of work in the vast office building. Congratulations!\n\nDon't worry if you've never programmed before - programming is just puzzle solving. If you strip away all the 1's and 0's and scary squiggly brackets, programming is actually really simple, logical, beautiful, and something that anyone can understand and have fun with!

It's comical, doesn't take itself too seriously, it has an ominous feel, and provides a good framework to hide away the fact that this is really about computer science and code optimization.\n\nPlaced in an office building, you're given a simple drag the blocks code editor to build programs for your worker to solve. Your aim is to make these as simple or efficient as possible. Now, I should say that I despise drag the block code editors, so it came as a great surprise to me when I figured out that if you drag some blocks, hit 'copy' and then paste it in a notepad program, it's actually just assembly code. You can program it however you want. Great!\n\nThe tasks themselves start of pretty easy, but quickly grow in complexity. They range over your standard fare of beginner programming tasks, from string manupulation, sorting etc. to some more complex ideas such as using prime numbers towards the end. These definitely provide a challenge when optimizing, and some immense satisfaction when you can beat the targets.\n\nDefinitely worth playing if you're at all interested in computer science, or programming and logic in general.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/375820/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","The robopocalypse is nigh!\n\nThe writing’s been on the wall for years, and yet we blindly stride forward toward a self-constructed doom. Despite warnings from CEOs, internet celebrities, and science fiction movies the world over, we the sheeple refuse to accept that our ravenous technological cravings have sealed our fate. The question is not if but when our new robot overlords will rise to power, eventually overtaking humanity and ushering in a new era of life on earth. As robotic life ascends we will watch, helpless, as they move in on our land, our loved ones, and especially, our jobs. Here, amidst the pandemonium, we will be reminded of Tomorrow Corporation, a tiny indie developer known for their aggressive cynicism and delightfully unsettling artwork. They tried to warn us, but alas their message came too late.\n\n“How did they warn us,” you may ask yourself, as the metallic arms of a superior species crushes your spine like so many forests destroyed in the name of progress. Why, with entry level coding puzzles of course! Tomorrow Corporations’ 2015 follow up to 2012’s Little Inferno (also known as Schrödinger’s cutest and most flammable cat), Human Resource Machine is a programming focused puzzle game featuring everything you would expect from a studio that has seemingly fallen into an existential ditch and decided they liked it down there.\n\nHuman Resource Machine is two parts inscrutable “if-X-then-Y” coding conundrums, one part robotic doomsday sendoff to the white-collar worker, both delivered with as much self-aggrandizing snark as can be squeezed into the four or five hours the game takes to complete.\n\nIf you are expecting Human Resource Machine to offer you an introduction to real-world coding, you should probably look elsewhere. Rather than give you a crash course in any modern coding language, Human Resource Machine is a logic driven puzzler utilizing a simple drag-and-drop interface to order instructions for your worker to undertake (because aren’t we all just cogs in the capitalistic machine?). This approach does a lot to minimize the learning curve insofar as actually entering commands, and for the first few levels Human Resource Machine does a fantastic job of introducing basic order-of-operation sequences as it cycles in new commands and tasks you with completing tedious but oddly satisfying objectives.\n\nRather quickly though the steady difficulty curve Human Resource Machine begins to lead you down turns into a sharp incline. As one might expect from a game whose attempts at satire and metanarrative are as subtle as throwing someone out a window, Human Resource Machine is not the least bit interested in offering you a handhold when you come up against a puzzle that is utterly incomprehensible to those unfamiliar with coding logic. On the contrary, much of the game is predicated upon corporate enforced ignorance, with your boss overseeing you not for the sake of offering assistance but to mock your own inefficiency and inability to grasp what he assures you is basic at most.\n\nWhich, from what I have gleamed from actual coders who have played the game, is actually the truth. Though I wouldn’t have known from simply playing the game, Human Resource Machine is ostensibly among the least mentally taxing programming puzzlers currently out there (a genre made up of other obscure indie darlings, such as SpaceChem and TIS-100). This then makes it hard for me to understand who Human Resource Machine is for. As a non-coder I repeatedly found myself coming up against puzzles I hadn’t the slightest idea how to solve, forcing me to look outside the game for assistance, and even then often failing to understand how a solution worked therefore giving me little to go on for future puzzles. If Human Resource Machine was designed for accessibility, that goal was buried somewhere along the way and replaced with an inscrutable, unintuitive experience that is all the more aggravating because it apparently shouldn’t be as difficult as it is.\n\nEven when I was able to solve a puzzle on my own, I was met with a halfhearted sense of accomplishment, as even having made progress there was no guarantee the next level wouldn’t be entirely impenetrable. The difficulty curve in Human Resource Machine is among the most erratic of any game I have ever played, alternating between patronizingly simplistic and excessively challenging with the regularity of an elderly man’s digestive track.\n\nUpon progressing Human Resource Machine will occasionally interject with coffee break vignettes which flesh out what could loosely be called a narrative, but, more directly, serve to reiterate the game’s overarching message of impending robotic doom. Or maybe the take away is that all corporations are evil and are only keeping us around as long as we are still useful to them. Or maybe it’s that we will do anything, no matter how tedious and inane, if it’s framed as a game. I’m not sure I could say with certainty what Human Resource Machine is really trying to. From where I’m standing it seems generous to say it has much of a say on anything, and isn’t merely rattling off along the same “everything is meaningless” train of thought that began with (and was better executed in) Little Inferno.\n\nWhether a warning, a joke, or an attempt to reignite the market for edutainment, Human Resource Machine accomplishes little beyond damaging itself for the sake of establishing a tone that doesn’t actually say anything strongly enough to be worth hearing. At times, Human Resource Machine is a dry but reluctantly satisfying puzzle game, and at others it exhausted me with its antagonistic approach to instruction and tedious structure. At this point I would almost welcome the robotic uprising, as at the very least they will surely have a better time at this than I did. The warning may have failed then, but so did my program loop.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","May 30","false","5.8"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","10","19","0","0"

As well the graphically style they have also kept the fun little playful sound effects.\n\nGameplay\nYou use a series of commands to build a program which tells your worker what they have to do. It’s a very basic drag and drop system that lends itself nicely to new comers as you have to complete a serious of challenges to pass each area.\n\nThe game also introduces new elements for your programs as you progress, so where-as when you start out and you simplify have inbox and outbox, you soon unlock jump (which is a repeater), then later the ability to copy and paste to your boxes.\n\nmake sure to read everything in the note on the programming area, I know it may seem like common sense, but all the answers are hidden within it.\n\nThe levels gain in differently pretty quickly, but it’s all just logic and common sense, however when you start to get engrossed in it’s easy to forget and just jump straight into each puzzle.\n\nI’m a big fan of logic and puzzles so it’s very refreshing to pick up an indie game which is all about that and to enjoy it so much. It really does have a nice balance of lovely artwork along with a great game.\n\nIt let’s you try countless times so you can get your head around the maniacs the game is trying to lend itself to.\n\nLittle Extras\nYou can use a slider to make your worker walk faster but I really enjoy the animation style of this game so tend not to use it.\n\nYou can also choice different paths along the way of your progression, it’s a sort of hard vs harder, but I’m always up for a challenge so I took them head on.\n\nIf the game hasn’t given you enough challenges at this stage then you’ll be happy to know that each level can be completed in numerous ways\n\nRead in Full[www.dabs.com]","October 16, 2015","true","3.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

As well the graphically style they have also kept the fun little playful sound effects.\n\nGameplay\nYou use a series of commands to build a program which tells your worker what they have to do. It’s a very basic drag and drop system that lends itself nicely to new comers as you have to complete a serious of challenges to pass each area.\n\nThe game also introduces new elements for your programs as you progress, so where-as when you start out and you simplify have inbox and outbox, you soon unlock jump (which is a repeater), then later the ability to copy and paste to your boxes.\n\nmake sure to read everything in the note on the programming area, I know it may seem like common sense, but all the answers are hidden within it.\n\nThe levels gain in differently pretty quickly, but it’s all just logic and common sense, however when you start to get engrossed in it’s easy to forget and just jump straight into each puzzle.\n\nI’m a big fan of logic and puzzles so it’s very refreshing to pick up an indie game which is all about that and to enjoy it so much. It really does have a nice balance of lovely artwork along with a great game.\n\nIt let’s you try countless times so you can get your head around the maniacs the game is trying to lend itself to.\n\nLittle Extras\nYou can use a slider to make your worker walk faster but I really enjoy the animation style of this game so tend not to use it.\n\nYou can also choice different paths along the way of your progression, it’s a sort of hard vs harder, but I’m always up for a challenge so I took them head on.\n\nIf the game hasn’t given you enough challenges at this stage then you’ll be happy to know that each level can be completed in numerous ways\n\nRead in Full[www.dabs.com]","October 16, 2015","true","3.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I was a little disappointed with the limited commands in the game (There's no JNZ, for example), but happy to discover that some of the harder puzzles were basically built for more intricate commands. Because of this, you'll need to think outside the box more to find a solution, when you don't have the tools you'd usually have for such an issue.\n\nI would not use this to actually learn Assembly at all, but as a logic-building exercise (Which is a crucial skill in this field), it works quite well.\n\nThe challenges on each level (Solve with < x lines, or with < x steps) resulted in me finding multiple approaches to many of the levels, and they never felt unrealistic to me at all (As with some other programming games). You can always optimise the code more and more, but in real-world applications, past a certain point, this becomes trivial. So it's nice that you can do this, but you don't actually need to.\n\nOutside of the basic gameplay, the game has the same kind of whimsical-yet-heavy storytelling that Kyle Gabler's games so often have, and it doesn't beat you over the head with it. It's just kind of... there, offering you some speculative fodder and setting the tone for the game- Which it does very nicely.\n\nIf you're even idly interested in programming or code-based games, this is a good one.","May 15","true","11.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There's the extra challenges of refining your code to the smallest overall size or fewest steps to complete but yeah, they're mostly beyond me too.\n\nThankfully, it starts slow, drip-feeding a new command every few puzzles or so. It's a head-scratcher for me, to be sure but the game rides that wonderful balance between you knowing exactly what it is you have to do and you managing to weave your solution from the commands and floor space on hand.\n\nIt's cleanly presented but with that lovely Tomorrow Corporation artstyle and vibe.

I like puzzles and math, and in a way this had both.\n\nUnlike Little Inferno this isn't exactly a game for kids or those with simple minds and be silly and random. This does involve a lot of critical thinking after a certain point and it can be boring or frustrating for them. At times you'll find yourself having to experiement a lot to find a work around of what you're trying to accomplish, and that can be frustrating itself.\n\nYou will need patience for this game and find yourself taking breaks often after a few puzzles to rethink. You are able to copy the code into a notepad and study it there, to save up RAM/CPU and not accumulate uneeded hours, and then paste it when you might have a solution for it. Usually it's best to find a solution first and worry about optimizing it later so you can move on.\n\nThere is a story in this game, but haven't gone far enough to fully know it thus I can't say much on it. Either way it's not really a focus point just like Little Inferno.\n\nI'm told this game and TIS-100 combined is Programming 101.

If the levels didn't get so hard so quickly and there were some examples for how to solve some specific problems i would really recommend this game to my friends.","May 23","false","3.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It even gets the point across that optimising for speed can sometimes make programs bigger, and vice-versa (although it does so in a slightly annoying way, by limiting which instructions you have access to, when it could have made the same point in more realistic ways, like loop unrolling).\n\nThe UI could use a couple of improvements (like dragging instructions directly to memory "tiles" instead of having to do it in two steps, or having a way to adjust the sound and music volume, etc.), but overall it's decent. Definitely worth the 1€ I paid for it, and easily worth up to 5€ or so.

In all seriousness: I didn't expect a game to be fun which requires a programming-ish approach and thinking. If you are into software development, this may seem like work at home but it is not - unless you really love your job, then you probably should give it a try. This game takes logic to a different level. It is neither a Sudoko game nor a puzzle - you have to precisely instruct a specific moveset for each stage. Every task requires something different and thus you have to change the ruleset of your worker. It is actually a "dumbed" down version of programming and really challenging at that, if you are a perfectionist.

Spoiler: there is no story. They keep aluding to something big developing, but it never really happens. At least when Little Inferno had you waste your time pointlessly for hours, and aluded to something else, there really was something else at play. But not here. The ending really falls flat.\n\nFor $10, it was a little diversion, and if you wanted to churn away at some of the challenges, you could get a few hours out of this game, but I completed the main quest with mostly perfect scores and tried a few of the optional challenges, and made it just over 2 hours, and was left disappointed by the ending.

I think's probably trying to be friendly to non-programmers by leaving out as many of the niceties of a programming language as possible, hoping that that reduces complexity. Actually, all it means is that your programs become unreadable very, very quickly, lost behind a mess of arrows.\n\nI did wonder for a little bit if it was trying to make some clever point about how when you program for a job in real life, time pressures and unrealistic specifications lead to the production of unreadable code... but I think that's me being very generous.\n\nThe final straw came trying to solve a level full of letters. I tried 'bumping' the value of one of the letters, which means adding one to it. 'Don't be stupid!!!' Said the game. 'What would that even mean??'. It didn't seem to have a problem with letting me subtract the letter 'B' from the letter 'A', giving me the result -1.\n\nIf you want a programming game, buy SpaceChem instead, or play The Codex of Alchemical Engineering free on various flash gaming sites...","May 5","false","8.8"," 9 of 21 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","9","21","0","6"

But it isn't educational at all.\n\nEvey time I (a newcomer to these kinds of logic puzzles) came across something unfamiliar, like a XOR gate, or using the given logic commands to multiply, the game didn't teach me a damn thing. In the case of XOR gates, the only extra information I got told me I should go research it.\n\nI need to reiterate that. Instead of teaching me and explaining the logic of this, or at least giving me a hint in the right direction, the game effectively told me to google it instead.\n\nSo I did. And because I had no idea how to apply the concept I had researched towards what I was seeing the game, I ended up just finding a screenshot of the solution. Did I understand how to make a XOR gate in the game now? Yeah. But not through any effort of the game. And the overall concept still eludes me somewhat.\n\nI just hit a puzzle where I'm suppose to multiply two numbers using add, subtract, and other commands. There clearly must be a way to do it, but I'll be damned if I know how. The game hasn't got any hints or suggestions this time.

Upon starting the game, I was glad to see that it retained the unique aesthetic sense from the previous titles, but that feeling was quickly overtaken by a sense of frustration and apathy. After the first few stages the puzzles increased in difficulty in such a sharp and dramatic manner that I felt blindsided.\n\nEach stage of the game represents a year of employment and entails solving a programming problem involving some form of alphanumeric input and using your set of basic instructions to manipulate the data to conform to a desired form of output that your in-game boss communicates to you. You must construct a basic program using such tools as commands to pick items up from the input conveyor, copying to and from designated spaces, adding, subtracting, setting jump points useful for repeating sections of code and making conditional operations based on the data you happen to be working with at the moment. The puzzles start out easy enough, and it's simply a matter of arranging the commands at your disposal. After a short while though, the puzzles become exponentially more complicated and the game expects the player to take the few simple tools it gives, and use them to perform operations that the game makes little to no effort to explain. It felt as though since the game has established that you are capable of performing subtraction, you must therefore also be capable of not only division, but taking the products of multiple division operations, sorting them, and outputting them in a particular order – all using only the most basic of mathematical tools. Is it possible to accomplish these tasks? Yes. But the game doesn't establish the link between the simple and the complex, and doesn't prepare the player for the challenges it puts to them.\n\nI spent a period of time that I felt was sufficient with each puzzle and while the first quarter of the game was doable, after a while it became apparent that I wasn't going to be able to solve the rest of these puzzles on my own. Since I wasn't particularly enjoying the experience I decided I would follow a guide and at lease see if the story held any value. Unfortunately, what story is there is merely window dressing. Whereas the previous titles World of Goo and Little Inferno had stories that shed some light on their dystopian surrealist worlds, the world of Human Resource Machine is never particularly enriched. Apparently a machine army is taking over and nobody in the game seems to notice or care. Nor is it relevant to the challenges you are facing. The Kafkaesque setting and characters led me to believe that there was probably a message in here, but by the end I found I didn't know what, if any, message was meant to be conveyed and I no longer particularly cared.\n\nIn the end, I can only recommend this game to people that enjoy this very narrow type of programming-based logic puzzle. Anyone else will likely be frustrated and bored, and unfortunately the charming graphics and music won't be enough to keep the player's interest.","May 6","false","3.0"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","3","9","2","0"

You are given a very limited set of coding instructions which expand over the course of the game, and your goal is to solve all of the puzzles within a certain number of instructions or a certain number of lines executed. You have some basic looping commands (basically, GOTO and GOTO IF 0 and GOTO IF < 0), addition and subtraction, variables, pointers, and comments.\n\nThe goal is basically to take inputs and output according to the instructions. There are 41 levels in all.\n\nThere… honestly is little to be said about this game. It is pretty much a pure programming game, and while it might be an interesting puzzle for a lot of folks to solve, on the other hand, I feel like if you didn’t understand programming, a lot of this game would be very inaccessible, despite its supposedly easy interface. Writing programs in it is a process of click and drag, there’s no real ability to create subroutines, and sometimes it can feel a bit tedious when you realize you’ve barely exceeded the necessary parameters and are going to have to take an entirely new approach.\n\nHonestly, if you’re going to spend six hours messing around with programming, you might as well spend that time messing around with a real programming language. The story here is at best vague and at worst obtuse and self-contradictory; are you working for robots? Are you a robot yourself? Who knows, and who cares? The whole thing ends up feeling rather pointless in the end.\n","May 8","false","6.8"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

If you know a little or a lot about coding, I can't recommend this. Too often you feel like you're trying to walk with your legs cut off at the knees - you see a problem & know immediately how to solve it, but the tools required are not available.\n\nExample: Multiplying two numbers without knowing what they are beforehand. Easy - just multiply a by b.\nNo - no multiply function. Okay, So I store a, then store b, then add a to a b times.\nNo - you can't use variables like that. You have to store a, then b, then add a to a, store it as c, then take one from b, check if b = 0, then add a to c, then take one from b, check if b = 0, then add a to c, then take one from b, check if b = 0, then add a to c, then take one from b, check if b = 0...\n\nYou will have to do each of these steps manually, with a mouse, just to do basic multiplication. Bubble sort? Two's Complement? There are infinitely saner ways to learn about this, and there is almost no handholding. Quite literally the only advice you will get sometimes is like this: "This procedure is called XOR. You make look it up online if you wish to do further study." Well, if you enjoy learning about Exclusive Or et al., skip the game & watch Computerphile on YouTube.\n\nEven with labels, complex functions are too unwieldy to see as there are only 16 or so lines of commands are visible at once, and loops/jumps take up two lines so if you need recursion (and look at what you have to do just to multiply, so you will need it), finding where changes happen is nightmareish. This is why we indent our code!\n\nThe story is there, but not even as close to engaging as Little Inferno, let alone World of Goo. The graphics style is just like 2D Boy/Tomorrow Corporation's other work, familiar & quite enjoyable. The soundtrack is pleasant at first but will rapidly grate.\n\nThis game will teach you about logical operations in a curiously if not particularly intuitive fashion - it will NOT teach you how to program!","October 17, 2015","false","2.6"," 59 of 125 people (47%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","47","59","125","4","13"

Not too much and not too less effects and some cool jams playing in the background. It looks like someone put quite some love and effort in making the game look good.\n- The learning curve is not that steep, even unexpierienced users can play this games. The explanations are on the point, always enough for you to know what you have to know. If you want to hear more, they can tell you and give you examples. If it's still not enough they suggest you to search the internet where you can fin plenty of knowledge.\n- Cute little references to programming are all over the place. If you know whta they mean, go look for them!\n\nDownsides\n- The game is very short. A skilled programmer could play trough the stoty and maybe even through the side levels and still refund the game. More levels would be awesome.\n- The story is very sparse, more or less like the social life of a hardcore programmer.\n- This game has an insane potential for a level editor! Making own puzzles to challenge other players to get the fastest and smallest program is something I like to see.\n\nWhat others may find negative, but I rather like\n- This game is a port from mobile devices, the input style is adapted. Basically this means there is not keyboard and no typing. The program is put together by dragging and dropping instructions, clicking to change argumnets and even comments are drawn rather than typed (what I really like a lot!). This reminds me a lot of graphical learning programming languages like scratch but in Human Rescource Machine, everything just feels a lot smoother.\n- The instruction set is rather bare bone comparised with normal programming languages but otherwise there would be a lot more instructions to learn and the puzzles where much less challenging. Look at games like Zachtronics "TIS-100", the instruction set there is likewise small but you have even less memory!\n- You can get lost in you code really fast if you do not do structuring and subsequent commenting. It is training for everyone to keep a more or less coding style. Otherwise, if you want to complete the game as fast as possible to be able to refund it afterwards because it is so short and you just hack you programs so they work, you will find yourself spending a lot of time guessing what which part of it does what, having no clue and starting it all over.\n- I saw some people are complaining about the lack of functions. Here is what I say: Look at assembly languages. There are no functions either. Just subroutines, return addresses and you even have to manage the stack all by yourself. To make subroutine calling (this is needed for example to use recursion easily) you need much more memory than the Human Rescource Machine has to offer.\n\nTo sum it up, this game is actually not that bad, but it has a whole lot of unused potential and I really like to see it updated with new content. For now is is just too expensive (9.99€), half the price would suit it better.","October 17, 2015","false","18.3"," 20 of 45 people (44%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","44","20","45","4","3"

The main thing it will teach you is conditionals and branching, but I doubt it dives deeper than that thus it's a meh all around. It's just a very dumbed down version of assembly, there's no need to pick this game up if you're a programmer, interested in programming, etc. Get TIS-100, it's much better, albeit it too is a dumbed down version of assembly. Try out CiggCembly[kongregate.com] for free for a real assembly puzzler that touches on stack, registers, bit arithmetic, self modification, etc.\n\nAnyways, there's no real appeal to the game (for me at least) as a programming puzzler, so I can not recommend it. It could be fun for you, but for me it's just a frustrating experience due to the simplicity of the game and the lack of breadth or complexity as to the 'asm' functions it provides.

Seeing images of Human Resources Machine, I had assumed that it would do something similar in terms of exploiting space to create programming puzzles; in fact, the real game is played in a sidebar full of simple commands. Where the little man is on the screen is completely irrelevant---there are no collisions, nor even a command to move to the space right or left. Instead, you deal with space purely as a list of numbered addresses. TIS-100 and SpaceChem both force your programs to move through space, creating a novel riff on programming with problems of adjacency and making efficient use of limited space to accomplish complex tasks. HRM, by contrast, is much closer to working through an introductory CompSci problem set. The game is also marred by a poor interface; commands can only be entered by drag-and-drop, where the keyboard would be much simpler to use.\n\nThis isn't a bad game---three to five hours of decent puzzles without finishing some of the harder challenges---but it really has nothing to recommend it over a Zachtronics puzzler.

Human Resource Machine does not live up to their legacy - it has significantly less depth of story and gameplay.\n\nHRM's story is just a linear sequence of predictable events. I'm going to ruin it for you: Something is wrong, robots are coming, robots have come, robots have taken over, you've been obsoleted by the invention of the computer.. That's it. Maybe you get another cutscene if you 100% all bonus objectives, but how inane the story is so far, I doubt it'd be worth it.

The inputs are numbers and letters. In a few levels, the letters actually spell something! Yeah, it's usually not very exciting. The problem is that the primary source of difficulty is how bad the programming interface is - you drag and drop instructions in a list. You can only see about 15 instructions on the screen at once, and you'll often end up with a big mess of overlapping arrows.\n\nFinding solutions is easy, but inputting them into the computer is tedious. You're basically spending most of your time as the compiler, not the programmer. There are only about 5 levels that are actually difficult to find the solution to.

Solving the levels (ie just having a piece of code taking the input and generating all correct output) is simple enough, but aiming for the optimizations challenges (in both number of instructions and number of steps to run) will keep you busy for a while :)\n\nIf you're not a programmer, or if you've only played around totally visual languages, this is a neat intro to barebones concepts: the floor tiles of the office represent memory storage, and you only get basic tools to do the work your boss wants: get a value from the incoming conveyor, copy it's value to a floor space, add and compares values.. Create loops to repeat steps with jumps in the code.. Get what you need done and put the correct results on the ouput converyor belt. You start by only reading and writing boxes all the way to do sorts and all kinf od neat tricks :)\n\nIn my case, this was really in a sweet spot: I'm in IT, but not a programmer, except from time to time having to do scripting. I made my way on my own to the end credits, came across optimized solutions for maybe a third of the puzzles, and enjoyed working with others and learning tricks to get to the rest.\n\nA big plus for the Steam version: the forums are full of really neat people actually discussing tips and tricks and sharing solutions.\n\nThe only /slight/ disappointment: while there are cutscenes and a bit of a story, it is /not/ as fleshed out or.. hmm.. clever? as the ones in previous titles from the same people. If this is primordial to you, this is something to consider before buying. For me it would have been a cherry on top, but I'm happy with all the fudge and peanuts. Now I'm hungry.\n\nDefinitely recommended.","October 25, 2015","true","13.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/infiniteLimit/recommended/375820/","infiniteLimit","infiniteLimit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/infiniteLimit/","296 products in account","Human Resource Machine is a puzzle game in which you do a bunch of programming challenges and then watch some cutscenes by the creators of Little Inferno and World of Goo. I haven't played WoG, but the art style is a carbon copy of Little Inferno. I personally don't mind, it's serviceable and cute, but don't expect much. The music is not really important, but didn't annoy me, although I turned it off later to listen to my own music. Sound effects can get a bit annoying in the longer puzzles but that's only natural.\n\nThe puzzles themselves are not very difficult or very easy. They are somewhat challenging, especially if you try to get the optional challenges, which the game warns you are hard. They are. If you are familiar with programming puzzles, this is that. The programming language is not real, but resembles assembly or other (educational) high level languages. It is, however, not a real language. You'll enjoy the game if you enjoy programming puzzles and won't enjoy it if you don't enjoy them.\n\nThe game's major disadvantage is the complete lack of being able to write. Comments are hand-drawn, which is fun but I can never get in much information. You won't need much of them because the programs will generally be short, but it's an annoyance. The max speed at which the programs run is also just too slow; I got bored waiting for the final few programs. The game seems made for touch control. Like with real languages, this fake one has some limitations. I didn't mind the language that much, but it's a shame you won't actually learn a new language from doing this (although it can help improve your skills). They also explain some concepts very minimal and then tell you to look it up on the web if you still don't know.\n\nThe story is very thin; don't expect anything of the level of Little Inferno. Overall, it is a fun programming puzzle game in a good package. There are free alternatives, but the overall package is done very well. Difficulty scales well, the look is cute and there's a tiny bit of story sprinkled on top. It's a shame the game has some annoyances but you probably already know if this is the game for you. The game is also very short.\n\nRecommend if you like programming puzzles or if it's on sale and you like raw puzzle games.","October 26, 2015","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm also pretty sure this game was directly inspired by the Little Man Computer! I will list the pros and cons, and then conclude my review, with a rating out of 10.\n\nPros:\n\n+ Do not need to know how to program, just how to solve puzzles.\n\n+ Great art design.\n\n+ Lots of levels to play through, including some branched off more difficult levels that deviate from the main story.\n\n+ Great price for what you get.\n\n+ Very good tutorial.\n\n+ Some levels will ultimately leave you stumped for quite a while!\n\n+ Inside each level, you can ask the person at the desk for examples, or further explanations of the level.\n\n+ "Optimisation Challenges" - basically, "can you complete the level using x or less commands?" These add a decent replay value, and challenge you more.\n\n+ Can go forward or backwards one command a time, for program debugging, instead of only being able to play and reset.\n\n+ Comments! You can label certain parts your "program", so you know what part is doing what. (Or other people know, if you struggle and need some external help! These come in a couple of levels after the tutorial.)\n\n+ Humorous dialogue!\n\n+ Runs very well on a whole range of hardware. 60FPS @ 60Hz on Intel HD with a Pentium B950.\n\nCons:\n\n- No options. The resolution will play native, and you can only toggle windowed or fullscreen.\n\n- No sound options. Volume is at 100%, though you can turn off music in-game.\n\n- Can't scroll up or down your command list once you run the simulation, which can be a minor annoyance if you want to follow it as it plays.\n\nConclusion:\n\nA great game with a large target audience (if you can logically think and solve puzzles, this game is for you), created by Tomorrow Corporation - the creators of Little Inferno and World of Goo. The game has a linear set of levels, but has branches of levels that are of harder difficulty than the linear storyline, thus keeping the game fresh. The optimisation challenges further this, and add a replay value if you want to perfect levels. Ultimately, I would recommend this game strongly for those who like puzzle games, and the fact that it runs very well on even lower end hardware.\n\nRating: 9/10","November 14, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The difficulty in this was certainly not the algorithms themselves, but the (extremely) rudimentay commands you get (especially when you're used to powerful languages that would do in one line what you might achieve here with a few hundreds, more or less).  And if you are obsessed with optimizing your codes, then it should occupy you for a little while.\n\nI would have liked a bigger board for writing my programs.

I honestly can't recommend it to everyone, as it requires a very specific way of thinking. But if you have any knowledge in coding, or want to get into coding, this is a fun set of challenges to tease your brain.\n\nAs far as level of difficulty, it's nothing you won't find in assembly language homework assignments, so if you have that background, things will just be a matter of implementing the solution. However, for someone who hasn't dealt with this kind of stuff before, the commands can seem very limited and confusing, so I do warn anyone who doesn't want to do some heavy thinking to stay away.\n\nFor those who are experienced programmers, the game does grade you on optimization after the first few levels, which does get interesting for some of the later levels where you can optimize a solution for either number of instructions, or actual runtime, but not both with the same solution.\n\nThe story is very minimal, so if you're not into coding and just want to see the story, you'll be disappointed.

I'd like it if they added that sort of global leaderboard aspect, so you knew what to aim for.\nOne downside is that because there is no limit on program length, beating the speed challenges is often simply a matter of applying loop unrolling, which while a very useful optimisation technique, isn't very ... elegant.","January 4","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I can see however this being some younger teachers attempt to make low level programming appealing to his students, but if completing a puzzles isn't enough reward for you then I'm not sure you're going to get much more out of that.\n\nIt has a very niche appeal that I appreciated, but I would have liked maybe a bit more window dressing. Especially regarding the ending which for me is the thing I am working towards in games from this company.\nI thought the last segment in Little Inferno did a good job at giving you just a little bit extra for your time and I could see a scenario where you get a bit more of a glimpse of what you, the employee, have brought upon this world with your optimizations.\n\nI initially wondered if this was a good tool to get friends into programming and it is for some aspects, but it is not comprehensive and I think by the time they reach the end they will be too frustrated and not finish it. I think the critical path ramps up a bit too much and some of the later puzzles should have been on the side branches to avoid frustration. Maybe a hint system that gave you a bit more info would have helped. Letting the player adjust their own difficulty.\n\nTo sum it up, this game is a great teaching tool and refresher for computer scientists and people wanting to be, however do not give this to your friends and expect them to finish it on their own without previous programming experience.","February 7","true","13.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The puzzles weren't too hard for a programmer, but I had plenty of fun and came up with dozens of solutions while tring to optimize them.\nFlaws: it's irritating that some things that work in assembly programming don't work in the game. For instance, if D - B = 2, why shouldn't B + 2 = D, instead of an error? It makes some things more annoying than they should be.\nAlso, there's no code block copying and you can only save 3 solutions to any puzzle - both problems can be overcome by copying your solutions into text files, but you shouldn't have to do that.\nFinally, I found it boring that many programs could be speed-optimized by merely unrolling loops. I know that's a real technique, but it just isn't that interesting. Maybe you could make unconditional jumps free?

The puzzles weren't too hard for a programmer, but I had plenty of fun and came up with dozens of solutions while tring to optimize them.\nFlaws: it's irritating that some things that work in assembly programming don't work in the game. For instance, if D - B = 2, why shouldn't B + 2 = D, instead of an error? It makes some things more annoying than they should be.\nAlso, there's no code block copying and you can only save 3 solutions to any puzzle - both problems can be overcome by copying your solutions into text files, but you shouldn't have to do that.\nFinally, I found it boring that many programs could be speed-optimized by merely unrolling loops. I know that's a real technique, but it just isn't that interesting. Maybe you could make unconditional jumps free? Just a thought.\nStill, this is a very good game and I can easily recommend it regardless of programming experience.","October 27, 2015","true","14.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/infiniteLimit/recommended/375820/","infiniteLimit","infiniteLimit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/infiniteLimit/","296 products in account","Human Resource Machine is a puzzle game in which you do a bunch of programming challenges and then watch some cutscenes by the creators of Little Inferno and World of Goo. I haven't played WoG, but the art style is a carbon copy of Little Inferno. I personally don't mind, it's serviceable and cute, but don't expect much. The music is not really important, but didn't annoy me, although I turned it off later to listen to my own music. Sound effects can get a bit annoying in the longer puzzles but that's only natural.\n\nThe puzzles themselves are not very difficult or very easy. They are somewhat challenging, especially if you try to get the optional challenges, which the game warns you are hard. They are. If you are familiar with programming puzzles, this is that. The programming language is not real, but resembles assembly or other (educational) high level languages. It is, however, not a real language. You'll enjoy the game if you enjoy programming puzzles and won't enjoy it if you don't enjoy them.\n\nThe game's major disadvantage is the complete lack of being able to write. Comments are hand-drawn, which is fun but I can never get in much information. You won't need much of them because the programs will generally be short, but it's an annoyance. The max speed at which the programs run is also just too slow; I got bored waiting for the final few programs. The game seems made for touch control. Like with real languages, this fake one has some limitations. I didn't mind the language that much, but it's a shame you won't actually learn a new language from doing this (although it can help improve your skills). They also explain some concepts very minimal and then tell you to look it up on the web if you still don't know.\n\nThe story is very thin; don't expect anything of the level of Little Inferno. Overall, it is a fun programming puzzle game in a good package. There are free alternatives, but the overall package is done very well. Difficulty scales well, the look is cute and there's a tiny bit of story sprinkled on top. It's a shame the game has some annoyances but you probably already know if this is the game for you. The game is also very short.\n\nRecommend if you like programming puzzles or if it's on sale and you like raw puzzle games.","October 26, 2015","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For example, you can copy, paste, add or substract but you can't multiply or divide. At the beginning you just need to add 2 and 2, but this rapidly escalates to making divisions (still without a division tool!), sorting data in alphabetical order, and extracting prime numbers!\n\nIt will require quite some creativity, experimentation and debugging to achieve, but you will be surprised and amazed how simple the solution always is.\n\nIt's about programming and yet it's not actual programming. It just teaches you how how to "think" like a machine. If you actually have programming skills you will possibly find this game too easy, or frustrating.\n\nOtherwise Human Resource Machine is a really challenging experience; it will require you to imagine and conceptualize your programs beyond what's displayed on the screen, until you find one of the solutions. There are many ways to solve each puzzle.

I honestly can't recommend it to everyone, as it requires a very specific way of thinking. But if you have any knowledge in coding, or want to get into coding, this is a fun set of challenges to tease your brain.\n\nAs far as level of difficulty, it's nothing you won't find in assembly language homework assignments, so if you have that background, things will just be a matter of implementing the solution. However, for someone who hasn't dealt with this kind of stuff before, the commands can seem very limited and confusing, so I do warn anyone who doesn't want to do some heavy thinking to stay away.\n\nFor those who are experienced programmers, the game does grade you on optimization after the first few levels, which does get interesting for some of the later levels where you can optimize a solution for either number of instructions, or actual runtime, but not both with the same solution.\n\nThe story is very minimal, so if you're not into coding and just want to see the story, you'll be disappointed. However, for the specific niche of people who would enjoy the gameplay, it's a very solid experience in a neat little package.","December 31, 2015","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The theme is applied pretty well, and adds something to the game.\nIt isn't particularly long, if you are familiar with programming you could get through the whole thing in a day with both length and speed challenges beaten, but that seems reasonable for the price asked.\nUnlike TIS-100, the challenge limits seem to be fixed, rather than based on what users have actually achieved, and many are not the best achievable, so you never know if you could push slightly harder to get an even better result. I'd like it if they added that sort of global leaderboard aspect, so you knew what to aim for.\nOne downside is that because there is no limit on program length, beating the speed challenges is often simply a matter of applying loop unrolling, which while a very useful optimisation technique, isn't very ... elegant.","January 4","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I am not a programmer. Here is my review.\n\nYou play an office drone in the mailroom of a large corporation, tasked with menial jobs like sending boxes from the inbox to the outbox, adding numbers to them, subtracting numbers, reordering them, sending only primes, alphabetizing, etc. along the way. As you progress, there are little bits of "story" that just seem cute at first but then become hilarious as you realize the world outside is changing in strange ways as you while away the years in an office. I was pleasantly surprised that this game even had a story at all.\n\nAs for the coding itself. You have a limited amount of commands, so your code is never going to be super efficient. (Ex. You have to divide quite often, but a divide command is unavailable, so you have to do an excessive amount of subtraction to get the same effect). A lot of the fun comes from trying to figure out non-obvious ways of achieving tasks that are simple in the real world with what you have. There are also challenges for optimizing your code, either with the minimum amount of steps or the minimum amount of commands. The coding style is with little boxes that you arrange in a list (no typing code), some with arrows to redirect your sequence. It's most similar to the coding system Scratch, for reference.\n\nPros:\n+Great art style\n+Good music (although repetitive, but I never got sick of it)\n+Speed/efficiency challenges for each level add replayability\n+Harder bonus levels that you can skip if you don't want the challenge\n+Cute little story\n+Slick UI, with only minor issues (see Cons)\n\nNeutral:\n~Minimal story, so don't expect one and you won't be disappointed. In fact, I was pleasantly surprised at what there was.\n~Mouse only. This isn't really too big of an issue, but there are ways to add notes to your code to help you keep track of what you're doing, but you have to write them by had with your mouse, which is kind of annoying. Definitely not game breaking, and it also allows you to draw pictures if you want, which did come in handy at times.\n\nCons:\n(None of these are game-breaking. Just little annoyances)\n-Code is very inefficient, so you end up with really long bits and it's easy to forget what parts of the code are doing what. You either need to use the note function to remind yourself what you're doing or debugging your code will be a nightmare. When changing one thing led to tons of errors, I often just deleted everything and started from the beginning just because it was easier than figuring out what I had done.\n-No way to select chunks of code for easy delete. If you wanted to get rid of half of your 40-command-long-code, you had to delete each command by hand, or just delete the entire thing at once and start from scratch.\n\nOverall: 9/10. If you're a programmer, you might find this too easy. Go play SpaceChem instead. For the average gamer who likes logical arguments or amateur coding, you'll find this to be a hoot. Cute little game. Overall playtime for me: 15 hours, all levels (without doing optimization challenges).","May 12","true","15.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The presentation is adorable, the UI is functional (although liable to drive anyone with real-world coding experience to distraction), the puzzles are smart, and the difficulty progression is measured.\n\nSo why aren’t I more enthused with it? I think that the problem lies with me. I’ve dabbled with code over the years, I took an Assembler 101 course in college (which literally involved solving many of the exact puzzles provided in this game), and I’ve played other games that did the same job better. And by that, I mean that I’m a fan of Zachtronics’ games. Between SpaceChem, TIS-100 and Infinifactory, I’ve solved much harder and more complex coding problems. By contrast, Human Resource Machine is a bit of a snoozefest.\n\nAnd therein lies the problem. Human Resource Machine is an excellent coding game FOR PEOPLE THAT AREN’T EXPERIENCED CODERS. For folk with any degree of serious software chops, this isn’t going to stretch them. Of course, there’s some scope for chasing the optimization dragon, with in-game goals for lines of code and cycles to complete, but given the extremely simple nature of the puzzles, often those goals don’t even provide much of a stretch.","April 11","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I haven't played WoG, but the art style is a carbon copy of Little Inferno. I personally don't mind, it's serviceable and cute, but don't expect much. The music is not really important, but didn't annoy me, although I turned it off later to listen to my own music. Sound effects can get a bit annoying in the longer puzzles but that's only natural.\n\nThe puzzles themselves are not very difficult or very easy. They are somewhat challenging, especially if you try to get the optional challenges, which the game warns you are hard. They are. If you are familiar with programming puzzles, this is that. The programming language is not real, but resembles assembly or other (educational) high level languages. It is, however, not a real language. You'll enjoy the game if you enjoy programming puzzles and won't enjoy it if you don't enjoy them.\n\nThe game's major disadvantage is the complete lack of being able to write. Comments are hand-drawn, which is fun but I can never get in much information. You won't need much of them because the programs will generally be short, but it's an annoyance. The max speed at which the programs run is also just too slow; I got bored waiting for the final few programs. The game seems made for touch control. Like with real languages, this fake one has some limitations. I didn't mind the language that much, but it's a shame you won't actually learn a new language from doing this (although it can help improve your skills). They also explain some concepts very minimal and then tell you to look it up on the web if you still don't know.\n\nThe story is very thin; don't expect anything of the level of Little Inferno. Overall, it is a fun programming puzzle game in a good package. There are free alternatives, but the overall package is done very well. Difficulty scales well, the look is cute and there's a tiny bit of story sprinkled on top. It's a shame the game has some annoyances but you probably already know if this is the game for you. The game is also very short.\n\nRecommend if you like programming puzzles or if it's on sale and you like raw puzzle games.","October 26, 2015","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You might not need to come back to it again after you've solved all the puzzles and earned the optimization points for the fastest and/or smallest solutions, but its cheaper (and more entertaining) than a night at the movies.","November 21, 2015","true","19.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It sets out puzzles that require the worker to move inputs on an assembly belt to the output belt using only the provided commands and floor cells. It's incredibly engrossing and suprisingly challenging. The only serious flaw is the commenting system. Rather than simply allow the user to type in comments, it forces the player to draw them using the mouse. Perhaps someone thought it was cute, but it's a serious handicap, since it means that practically speaking, you're generally not going to bother adding comments given that they're extremely tedious to create. And when your program gets really complex, comments become very important. Otherwise, it's an outstanding game. 9/10","December 26, 2015","true","23.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I honestly can't recommend it to everyone, as it requires a very specific way of thinking. But if you have any knowledge in coding, or want to get into coding, this is a fun set of challenges to tease your brain.\n\nAs far as level of difficulty, it's nothing you won't find in assembly language homework assignments, so if you have that background, things will just be a matter of implementing the solution. However, for someone who hasn't dealt with this kind of stuff before, the commands can seem very limited and confusing, so I do warn anyone who doesn't want to do some heavy thinking to stay away.\n\nFor those who are experienced programmers, the game does grade you on optimization after the first few levels, which does get interesting for some of the later levels where you can optimize a solution for either number of instructions, or actual runtime, but not both with the same solution.\n\nThe story is very minimal, so if you're not into coding and just want to see the story, you'll be disappointed.

Especially regarding the ending which for me is the thing I am working towards in games from this company.\nI thought the last segment in Little Inferno did a good job at giving you just a little bit extra for your time and I could see a scenario where you get a bit more of a glimpse of what you, the employee, have brought upon this world with your optimizations.\n\nI initially wondered if this was a good tool to get friends into programming and it is for some aspects, but it is not comprehensive and I think by the time they reach the end they will be too frustrated and not finish it. I think the critical path ramps up a bit too much and some of the later puzzles should have been on the side branches to avoid frustration. Maybe a hint system that gave you a bit more info would have helped.

Sometimes I would go to sleep and think about how to clear a level and then wake up like "I GOT IT!".\n\nI'm a very laidback gamer, so I don't play a lot of games. At all. So I find it impressive that this game managed to keep me entertained for 10+ hours and even made me think of it outside of those hours.

The game explains the mechanics well at the beginning and it's clear what your goals are. Obviously, the first levels are very easy. It just keeps stepping it up a nodge.

You write in assembly-like language (very simple instructions) programs that manipulate data in input, and generate some data in output. Task vary from doubling the input values, to sorting the input values.\n\nPros:\n- easy to learn, good for young learners\n- good learning curve: instructions are introduced when needed\n- simple UI: instructions dragged and dropped as blocks\n\nCons:\n- if you don't like coding/puzzles stay away from this\n- Not many instructions are visible at a time\n- Too easy if you mastered TIS-100.\n\nThe pros are pretty much self-explanatory. The instructions as blocks are especially good for novices.\n\nAbout the cons, I found the puzzles too easy compared to the ones from TIS-100. Each puzzle has challenges on writing short or fast enough programs. Those are not always that easy, but personally they extended my play time from 5 to 7-8 hours. Not much.\n\nAbout TIS-100, I believe a comparison is needed. In TIS-100 you need to code a grid of processors that 1) can only run short programs and 2) have no memory. This made TIS-100 puzzles extremely hard. This game, instead, is about more traditional (simpler) coding because 1) there is only one processor, 2) programs can be indefinitely long, and 3) there is random-access memory (except for the first, very easy puzzles). The most obvious limitation of the processor is that you can't load an arbitrary value (say 4) in its register/tile, unless it is in a memory cell you can copy the value from.\n\nOverall, a nice puzzle game for people who like the genre or they want to learn what coding means. A little too easy for people who mastered TIS-100.\n\n","January 15","true","34.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game has an incredibly small footprint too, so even older and space strapped machines should be able to run this easily.\n\nI am currently nearly about half way through (not including optimization) and can honestly say that it is an excellent game.

You program a little worker by clicking together a program for him to execute. The game is a fantastic visualization of programming's simple concept - input/computation/output by mapping it onto a little office worker that fetches boxes from an input conveyor belt, varying storage capabilities and comparison operations and a final output coneveyor belt.\n\nEach level gives you a different task starting from very simple operations to increasingly more complex mechanics mirroring real-world techniques (pointers, zero-terminated strings anyone?). The tasks itself never feel repetitive, each one is a different challenge in itself. The learning curve is extremely well done and every level is a unique challenge. It just feels perfect in a way that you're never overwhelmed nor bored because of the available mechanics, all the while keeping the problems them simple and short enough to be done in a handful of steps.\n\nFor people that look for bigger challenges, there are optional side tasks (and they really become challenging), as well as special achievments for solving the regular and optional levels in as few as possible instructions (small program), or in as few as possible steps per input (small runtime).\n\nI really find it hard to put into words how excellent this game is.

I am not a programmer. Here is my review.\n\nYou play an office drone in the mailroom of a large corporation, tasked with menial jobs like sending boxes from the inbox to the outbox, adding numbers to them, subtracting numbers, reordering them, sending only primes, alphabetizing, etc. along the way. As you progress, there are little bits of "story" that just seem cute at first but then become hilarious as you realize the world outside is changing in strange ways as you while away the years in an office. I was pleasantly surprised that this game even had a story at all.\n\nAs for the coding itself. You have a limited amount of commands, so your code is never going to be super efficient. (Ex. You have to divide quite often, but a divide command is unavailable, so you have to do an excessive amount of subtraction to get the same effect). A lot of the fun comes from trying to figure out non-obvious ways of achieving tasks that are simple in the real world with what you have. There are also challenges for optimizing your code, either with the minimum amount of steps or the minimum amount of commands. The coding style is with little boxes that you arrange in a list (no typing code), some with arrows to redirect your sequence. It's most similar to the coding system Scratch, for reference.\n\nPros:\n+Great art style\n+Good music (although repetitive, but I never got sick of it)\n+Speed/efficiency challenges for each level add replayability\n+Harder bonus levels that you can skip if you don't want the challenge\n+Cute little story\n+Slick UI, with only minor issues (see Cons)\n\nNeutral:\n~Minimal story, so don't expect one and you won't be disappointed. In fact, I was pleasantly surprised at what there was.\n~Mouse only. This isn't really too big of an issue, but there are ways to add notes to your code to help you keep track of what you're doing, but you have to write them by had with your mouse, which is kind of annoying. Definitely not game breaking, and it also allows you to draw pictures if you want, which did come in handy at times.\n\nCons:\n(None of these are game-breaking. Just little annoyances)\n-Code is very inefficient, so you end up with really long bits and it's easy to forget what parts of the code are doing what. You either need to use the note function to remind yourself what you're doing or debugging your code will be a nightmare. When changing one thing led to tons of errors, I often just deleted everything and started from the beginning just because it was easier than figuring out what I had done.\n-No way to select chunks of code for easy delete. If you wanted to get rid of half of your 40-command-long-code, you had to delete each command by hand, or just delete the entire thing at once and start from scratch.\n\nOverall: 9/10. If you're a programmer, you might find this too easy. Go play SpaceChem instead. For the average gamer who likes logical arguments or amateur coding, you'll find this to be a hoot. Cute little game. Overall playtime for me: 15 hours, all levels (without doing optimization challenges).","May 12","true","15.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You program a little worker by clicking together a program for him to execute. The game is a fantastic visualization of programming's simple concept - input/computation/output by mapping it onto a little office worker that fetches boxes from an input conveyor belt, varying storage capabilities and comparison operations and a final output coneveyor belt.\n\nEach level gives you a different task starting from very simple operations to increasingly more complex mechanics mirroring real-world techniques (pointers, zero-terminated strings anyone?). The tasks itself never feel repetitive, each one is a different challenge in itself. The learning curve is extremely well done and every level is a unique challenge. It just feels perfect in a way that you're never overwhelmed nor bored because of the available mechanics, all the while keeping the problems them simple and short enough to be done in a handful of steps.\n\nFor people that look for bigger challenges, there are optional side tasks (and they really become challenging), as well as special achievments for solving the regular and optional levels in as few as possible instructions (small program), or in as few as possible steps per input (small runtime).\n\nI really find it hard to put into words how excellent this game is. Great art work, great puzzles, absolutely polished feel, great sound track.\n\nIf you're curious about programming or an actual programmer - give it a try!","April 17","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You'll look at basic input and output algorithms using simple programming buttons like "Inbox" , "Outbox", "sub", "add" and many more.\n\nIt will slowly up the difficulty as you climb the corporate ladder so to speak. It's challenging enough to keep you nitpicking your code until you get it just right. There are challenges for those that seem to fly through it that forces you to optimize your code on a previously defeated challenge which is easier said then done sometimes.\n\nThe graphics are cute and the audio is nice and crisp and suits the title. The game's music can get a little repetitive after a while but just listen to your own tunes and program away. The game has an incredibly small footprint too, so even older and space strapped machines should be able to run this easily.\n\nI am currently nearly about half way through (not including optimization) and can honestly say that it is an excellent game.

The presentation is adorable, the UI is functional (although liable to drive anyone with real-world coding experience to distraction), the puzzles are smart, and the difficulty progression is measured.\n\nSo why aren’t I more enthused with it? I think that the problem lies with me. I’ve dabbled with code over the years, I took an Assembler 101 course in college (which literally involved solving many of the exact puzzles provided in this game), and I’ve played other games that did the same job better. And by that, I mean that I’m a fan of Zachtronics’ games. Between SpaceChem, TIS-100 and Infinifactory, I’ve solved much harder and more complex coding problems. By contrast, Human Resource Machine is a bit of a snoozefest.\n\nAnd therein lies the problem. Human Resource Machine is an excellent coding game FOR PEOPLE THAT AREN’T EXPERIENCED CODERS. For folk with any degree of serious software chops, this isn’t going to stretch them. Of course, there’s some scope for chasing the optimization dragon, with in-game goals for lines of code and cycles to complete, but given the extremely simple nature of the puzzles, often those goals don’t even provide much of a stretch.","April 11","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
