Achievements are earned at the first level up.  Though I am sure many will still complain about microtransactions that NEVER, EVER have to be done.\n\nThe player levels up relatively fast giving the player a full energy bar to continue playing.  There are 38 locations in total to open.  There are also two nice features at the bottom of the page, a diary and main story quest log, so the player can keep track of the storyline.\n\nThe Hidden Object scenes start out with 3 items and the items increase at each level.  Also the player is encouraged to chain the object finds to increase the "prizes" of XP, money, items, and energy.  A special area feature is the little picture by each area name indicting the type of HO scene available.  "Sun" is straight find list.  "Hand and sun" Silhouette mode.  "Moon and stars" Night mode.  This makes it much easier to know, find and anticipate certain modes when needed for quests.\n\nMuch easier play style compared to other games of this type, with far less grinding then usual and who can beat the price of FREE, so give it a try if so inclined.","January 27","true","14.1"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","19","21","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/redarremer/recommended/415840/","redarremer","Red Arremer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/redarremer/","1340 products in account","Short version: Unless you REALLY like playing hidden object games, and you don't mind either spending money or lots of time waiting doing literally nothing, I cannot really recommend this game.\n\nThis game gives you quests which are "gather X amount of items", and you gather those items by going to the hidden object scenes, which you unlock by leveling up. Completing one rewards you with one or more random items. The game seems to give priority to those you need for your quests, which is good, as the amount of different items grows exponentially as you continue completing quests.\nNow this wouldn't be so bad, but sadly, the game uses the classic browser/mobile game trick where you have "energy", which you spend doing the HO scenes. As you go to locations more and more, they level up and cost more energy to do.\n\nNow, even all of that wouldn't be too bad, but then there's the "characters" you interact with. As you unlock more locales, more NPCs appear, roaming the map. There's several items that you can use with these NPCs to exchange for a random item out of their stock. Sadly, unlike with the HO scenes, the NPCs do not prioritize items you need, and some of these items are exclusive or just about exclusive to just these NPCs, meaning that if you have bad luck with rolls, you don't get the items you need or no needed collectibles at all. If you don't have the item you exchange for interacting with the NPCs, it costs in-game gold to interact with them.\nFor instance, I had a quest where I needed one item from the Wolf NPCs. It took me about 25 tries to finally get it off of him, and he only had 4 possible drops at the time (most of them didn't drop anything).\n\nIn other words, this game is very much designed to extort money from you by making you wait in order to play, and locking needed items behind the 100% random chance NPCs.\n\nIf you don't mind all of this, and like Hidden Object games, this game might be for you. Otherwise, though, I'd recommend looking at other ones.","January 28","false","65.7"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","14","17","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/awgenough/recommended/415840/","awgenough","AWG Enough","http://steamcommunity.com/id/awgenough/","2797 products in account","I like this game VERY much. It's like the average HOG and the average Labours-of-Hercules-like game had a child that took the best from its parents and grew up a beautiful and talended (and a little bit greedy) kid.\nYes, even if this game is marked as free you can indeed only have a limited first run using the resources you get at the beginning. But listen to me, it's a very good limited first run. I managed to make it last 3 hours circa, completing many quests and getting 15 achievements in the meantime.\nOnce your resources are over, you have two choices: pay to buy tokens (necessary to explore locations and therefore necessary to be able to play) or wait for them to be authomatically and free-of-charge refilled (it takes 3 to 5 hours to top your bar up, depending on how much into the game you are). I've obviously chosen to wait, not because I don't want to spend money but because I don't want to spend money on overpriced consumables. So, now I'm playing the game a couple of times per day (when I get back from work and before going to sleep), 20 minutes every time, and I'm still highly enjoying playing it, discovering new quests, collecting items to complete collections, unlocking new locations, getting many other achievements (currently 28 out of 53)... in a word, having fun.\nOh those were two words.\nLike "Just play it".\nOk those were three.","February 6","true","22.4"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"

However, having to wait or pay to refill your energy it is just rediculous for a game on Steam.\n\nAlso, where other games have you spend 1 energy for a level. This game has some weird setup where you spend 10 energy on one level and 13 or 15 on the next.\n\nIn the end, if you're looking for a quick fix in item finding puzzles, this can keep you busy for half an hour. If you want more of a binge gaming session stay clear of this.","January 28","false","0.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/artificialraven/recommended/415840/","artificialraven","ArtificialRaven","http://steamcommunity.com/id/artificialraven/","625 products in account","Mystic Saga is a freemium hidden object point & click game. You can access a few locations at first like a cabin or blacksmith's house and you just have to find the objects it tells you to find. When you do finish a stage, you're rewarded with items to turn in to NPCs and they'll unlock more quest and so on. You'll also earn experience points so you can level up and access even more stages.\n\nHere's the catch though. You get a certain amount of energy points. Every time you enter a stage it depletes your energy points and the only way to replenish them is by waiting minutes in real-time, finding energy repleneshing items from getting achievements or quest rewards, and by purchasing items from the in-game store with in-game currency. If you've run out of currency you can spend real money as a shortcut just like any freemium game. You run out of energy very fast too since a stage only takes a minute or less.\n\nThe artwork is nice at least, it looks like the art department put effort into that. The game itself is very repetetive and unrewarding though, there are much better hidden object games on steam that are worth buying rather than sinking $ into microtransactions in this game. I'm sure you can complete the game by not spending a dime but that would take patience I don't have. I've only played for an hour but having to replay the same stages over and over killed any motivation I had to keep going.","February 2","false","1.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I wasn't sure if I liked doing that so I tried this, it being free and all, and howdy I had a nice time looking for the things.\n\nI tried another free one with puzzles but I am too stupid for puzzles, not a joke I actually am, so this was better.\n\nIt would be nice if someone could help this village of people learn to look after their stuff better. I only played it for like an hour and change but it was staggering how many things they misplaced. Maybe they should keep a little journal saying where they last put their nest or bellows or statue of a samurai or bit of coral, that would make things a lot better for them.\n\nIt seems like this is pretty playable without any IAP's unless you want to play for several hours straight but come on man, don't you have some chores? Go rake up the leaves ya dingus.\n\nAll in all I had a nice relaxing time with this game and for no amount of dollars, which is my current budget for games, it is oh so right.\n\n7/7 misplaced oriental relics, would recommend.","April 14","true","1.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
