Regret a purchase? Switch back to a previous car that is still fully upgraded and you knew how to win in. You can't sell any cars you own, but its nice to know you won't screw yourself mid-game with a bad choice.\n\nCircuits are replayable as many times as you'd like. Try again and again to beat one, or replay a circuit as a cash-cow until you've got your funding for an upgrade.\n\nThis game does not use any resources from R&RR. It is the same game format and a similar concept, but there is nothing directly copied, so I can't see any takedown issues over this game.\n\nMusic is good, but repetative. Graphics are good, and show speed well. Opponents are good at blocking you in while the playing field is evenly matched.\n\nThe game concept is sound, and is exactly what you think it is... but...\n\nThe iffy and bad:\nThere is no map. There are signs before every turn that indicate the angle and direction, but without any way to see the full course, it is awkward trying to plan out the best path. Because the tracks are somewhat uniform, it takes a good bit of memorization to know when a turn is coming, and when is a good or bad time to use the turbo boost.\n\nThere both is and isn't gamepad support: my x360 gamepad works in the actual game, but not in the menus. There is no indication anywhere in-game of what buttons do what, and there is no way to reconfigure the gamepad buttons in the settings menu. For the record:\n\nRT: accelerate\nLT: brake/reverse\nA: turbo\nB: rear weapon\nX: front weapon\nY: respawn from off-track\n\nYou will need to use the keyboard ENTER and ESC for any and all menus. There is no mouse-click to match to the ESC button, and several menus do not have a back function beyond ESC. This is annoying, but workable. A different controller might be more effective than mine, but this is what I have.\n\nWeapons do not adjust for terrain. This game has a lot of ramps, jumps, and drops as you drive around the course, and even though some front-firing weapons do track after opponents, they frequently crash into a change in the track's slope. Again, track memorization will help, but that takes time to learn and there is no map to give hints to your location. Since weapons do not automatically reload to full between races, this can burn through your money.\n\nPower-ups are plentiful, but they are always in the center of the track, and are frequently taken by the lead vehicle. If you're trailing, you won't often find them... if you're leading, you can keep hitting them every few seconds, and unless you make a bad turn, you will not likely see another car for the rest of the race. This is kinda game-breaking, as this type of game is the most fun when you're actively fighting against the other cars.\n\nYou can upgrade a car's armor and weapon count a total of 5 times each. You can upgrade a car's top speed and acceleration as a single stat, 5 times each... each time you upgrade, it will either boost top speed or acceleration. Not both, and you can't choose which one. Its a set path.\n\nYou CANNOT upgrade your vehicle's handling. Your car will always turn at the same rate, and as you're able to drive faster, mid-to-late game cornering means hugging the outside of a turn and using the wall to grind around the corners because you simply cannot make the turns. Letting off of the accelerator button does not make your car turn any faster. Tapping the brake won't make you slide around a corner, but it will slow you down enough to make a turn... but there's not really a point to that, since grinding around the outer edge doesn't damage your car, and doesn't really slow you down enough to matter.\n\nYou will spin badly in mid-air if you angle off of a jump wrong, and you will get turned around from collisions. Your car will roll forward off of some ramps, and there is no way to correct this, which will randomly slow you down on landings. While reverse does work, turning while backing up is VERY slow, and this cannot be improved. If you face the wrong way for more than a few seconds, the game will auto re-spawn your vehicle facing the right way in the center of the track... it will sometimes do this while you're in the middle of a turn if you aren't facing the correct way, and has happened to me twice, so far.\n\nThe conclusion:\nThe opponents are not very challenging once you've upgraded your cars a bit... get ahead of them, and keep your car in the middle of the track whenever possible, and any race is yours. The unmapped tracks, weird landings from the many jumps, and lack of handling are far more of a threat than any of the other cars. Without being able to play against other opponents (at this time), or increase the opponent AI difficulty (I have not fully beaten the game, that may be an option after 1 completion, but I don't see anything for now), this is not a very challenging game.\n\nIf you're absolutely craving this kind of game, then get it, but be aware of what you're purchasing.","May 17, 2014","false","3.3"," 87 of 109 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","87","109","0","2"

But sadly, while this game has potential, it's way too buggy and unfinished to recommend. I've had a couple of crashes, freezes and the game minimizing the window for no apparent reason. Achievements don't work. Well, that's a lie. Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't. Sometimes achievements pop up an hour after you should have got them.\n\nThe handling of the cars can be extremely wonky. The controls are fine, it's the physics engine which will sometimes ragdoll your car in all different directions that kills it. You can hit a jump dead on and it will fling your car to the right or to the left. You can come to a complete stop because your car gets stuck in a wall. The AI might hit you from behind and your car will ragdoll 180 and respawn you on the track, killing your speed. Sometimes the game will respawn you even when you're going the right way because it thinks you're going the wrong way. The Angkor tournament, race 5 division A, has a jump with a speed boost in front of it. Once you hit the jump it flings you over the wall and you respawn. Every single time. You could use it to grind for the "fly out of the track 100 times" achievement. That's if achievements worked. It's all kinds of bad.\n\nLuckily, the game is not that hard. I've been able to win 4 out of the 6 tournaments even though the game does it's best to kill your progress with it's insane handling. The customization is nice though. 7 cars which you can upgrade either speed, armor or weapons. You'll have to replay some of the tournaments to earn enough money to progress, but that's fairly common in these kind of games.\n\nDevs promised to patch the game and fix achievements in June 2014. It's now December and there's been no word from them since, so don't expect these issues to be fixed. Also, there's no controller support in menus even though the store page claims full controller support.\n\nI cannot recommend this game due to the unfinished state and the broken handling. Pick up Death Rally instead.","December 16, 2014","false","4.5"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/metroretrogaming/recommended/284930/","metroretrogaming","[ᴸᴼᴳ]Metro Retro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/metroretrogaming/","1468 products in account","Basic InformationTitle: Speed Kills\nGenre: Action, Indie, Racing\nDeveloper: Holy Warp ,	Black Wing Foundation\nPublisher: Holy Warp, KISS ltd\nRelease Date: 16 May, 2014\n\nBasic OverviewThis is a very fun racing game that defiantly can cure the boredom in your life for a hour or two if you have it. It's graphics don't really suit the futuristic theme to the game since the game is set in the future. There isn't really anything really advanced in the environment that you race in. There is quite a balance of bad and good things about this game, so let's get started with the usual categories.\n\nGame PlaySo let's start off by talking about the game play of this game. It's simply a futuristic racing game with guns on your cars. There is quite a balance of good and bad things here. First off let's talk about the some of the good points about this game.  You'll be glad to know that (well for me anyways) this game has a high replay value. I'm not really sure what kept me going back to play this game, since I had a few short breaks, but I just did. It felt really satisfying to complete a race in first place and grab some money at the end to upgrade your car. It's also a very competitive game even though you are racing against bots. I would really like to see this game take thongs forward and possibly add a Online-Multiplayer mode to it for even more fun and replay value. Like I said in the overview, it seems to be really good at curing your boredom when you are playing it. I think that it's the satisfaction of shooting while you drive and winning first place in the race. Now for some bad things about this game that I don't really want to talk about but I will go through them none the less. The game play can be a bit frustrating at times, because sometimes the collisions of the cars can be very unforgiving. Starting a jump will immediately cancel out any nitro that you're using and since there are multiple jumps throughout each map this makes it difficult to take full advantage of your boost. Sometimes jumps can make you do a U turn if you don't land near enough straight, this can ultimately really mess up a race since you have to turn around and continue racing like nothing ever happened. I found that some of the upgrades where a little bit game breaking, for example if you upgrade your rig then use your boost at the start of the race then you can gain the lead straight off. You can then take very single power up that you can so that the cars behind you don't get any. However, this can also work the other way around. You could be last or near last and you can't pick up any power ups and really you're only chance of getting a power up is to restart. Another unfortunate thing about this game is that sometimes you have to grind for cash to even stand a fighting chance in the later levels. This can really drain the games replay ability and fun as no one wants to grind on a game for money to stand a chance to win. One last bad thing about this game is that there is no map to show you the track you are on. This means you have to memorize the track in order to get the full advantage of the track that you are on. The game slightly helps you, by having a arrow and a number to tell you how sharp the turn is and in which direction you are turning in. This kind of helps you but then again a map in the corner of the screen would've been a lot easier.\nScore (Out Of 10): 6 - Would like to see Online-Multiplayer, add a mini map in the top left or right of the screen, fix the spawn rate of the power ups, or increase the length of the track so you have a chance to get a power up if you're behind everyone else.\n\nGraphics/art styleThe graphics for me feel okay. They don't really seem to fit in with the kind of futuristic style that this game takes on with it. Would like to see some futuristic like technology around the environment  as I drive around the tracks. Maybe even some futuristic technology for your cars that make you go on the side of the wall or something. For me this game doesn't feel futuristic enough with the whole premise of it being in the distant future.\nScore (Out Of 10): 7 - Would like to see some more futuristic technology in the environment and/or for the cars.\n\nMusic & SoundsThe music for this game fits in nicely with the futuristic and racing style that this game has to offer, although can get a bit repetitive. The sounds are just generic, nothing much to really talk about with this category.\nScore (Out Of 10): 8 - Music can get repetitive after a while, and the sounds are just generic\n\nConclusionAlthough this game has a few flaws that let it down, I still recommend this game to racing fans. There is some really high replay value in this game, with a nice variety of cars and upgrades that can help you though the game. Although sometimes you may find that you have to grind for money to stand a fighting chance in some of the races, although winning a race in first place is really satisfying.\n\nFor more reviews on a wide range of games, go and follow Lot's O Giveaway's curator group here.","February 15","true","3.1"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","0"

That, coupled with the developers' near-total absence in the forums from the release date onward except to quickly respond that features or support will not be implemented, makes for a significant disappointment.  This could've been a heck of a lot of fun, but as it is, it feels like something that fell victim to the 90-90 rule of software development and the devs gave up after the first 90%.","April 27, 2015","false","26.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's bizarre how the game locks you into your lane, almost doing away with the need for steering. I say almost because for the most part you can just let your car smack into the rounded corners and allow your car grind along the barrier. Some barriers will look as smooth as the rest, however will send you careening back in the opposite direction.\n\nThe characters you meet (the other racers) tend to have no personality in their driving, and are strangely supportive of you between races on the loading screen, encouraging you to do better or congratulating you on a job well done. With the exception of the female-esque final baddie, who just spouts passive-agressive missives at you. Why does this robot have boobs and an accusing face anyway? Does it help her race?\n\nThere are a lot of games that do a lot better than this. Sure it's pretty, sure it passes the time okay, and sure it's cheap; but you get what you pay for.\n\nBuy it or don't.","September 22, 2014","false","3.7"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","3"
