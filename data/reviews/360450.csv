The art and animations are simplistic but really supplement the game. The gameplay itself plays out much like one might expect a one strike kill game to play. It's mostly a reimagining of rock paper scissors but with a twist. That twist being that you can see what your opponant is going to throw and can make changes, and so can he. So the match becomes a mind game as well as a test of twitch reflexes.\n\nThe bad:\n\nWell the biggest problem that I've noticed is the lack of content and variation.  All opponants look exactly the same and for all I know use the same AI. There's no kind of storymode that one might traditionally find in a fighting game. I haven't tried local versus mode, so I'll assume that functions, however the online competition has been a ghost town every time I've made the attempt.\n\n\nFinal thoughts:\n\nKiai Resonance feels like a great alpha build game. The core gameplay is beautiful and working as one might expect, but where's the content? Where are the different modes to offer some variety? I would be hopeful if this was an early access game that we might see the polish that this game deserves, but I see no indication that developement will continue. As of the time the I'm writing this review, Kiai Resonance is on sale for $4.49 and may be worth it just to enjoy the traditional styled Japanese art and get a small taste of some fun gameplay. For me, the lack of being able to do anything other than face the same AI over and over really takes away from the experience, so I don't see people really getting much playtime out of a title like this.","April 23, 2015","false","1.0"," 80 of 100 people (80%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","80","80","100","5","16"

In Kiai Resonance you play as a samurai and take part in quick fights and difficult challenges requiring fast reflexes as one hit kills in Kiai. Kiai Resonance is made up of singleplayer fights, multiplayer fights and challenges but my review is focusing on challenges and singleplayer only.\n\n+Cool painting-esque art style\n+Simple combat that's relatively easy to get to grips with\n+One hit kill combat makes the fights interesting and short\n+Three different combat stances to utilise, each with giving you a different advantage\n+Interesting challenges\n+There's a rush mode which makes you and your opponent charge towards each other at the start of the fight, makes things a little more interesting\n+Good tutorial\n+Full gamepad support\n+Great soundtrack and soundeffects\n\n-Kiai Resonance has a serious lack of content. There are only two characters to choose from. There are only three maps (four if you complete all of the challenges). There's no kind of upgrades or unlocks which doesn't exactly help its replay value.\n-The multiplayer is completely dead\n-Serious lack of graphical and audio options, all you get is Fullscreen: On/Off, Sounds: On/Off and Music: On/Off\n-The singleplayer AI doesn't provide much of a challenge once you've got your head around the controls\n\nVerdict:\n6.5\n\nKiai Resonance is a good samurai fighting game with a nice art style and simple combat that currently suffers from a serious lack of content.\n\n***This review was written using a key provided by the Developer for review purposes***\n\nEl K.","May 14, 2015","true","3.2"," 63 of 76 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","63","76","2","3"

It is a two-player, two-dimensional (2D) duelling game. Basically, you have two players in a 2D plane fighting with the same weapon, to the death. Speaking of Death, it's a one-hit kill system. If the sword as much grazes you, you instantly die, making the game very tense. It also makes it, in a sense, strategic.\n\nIn my experience, most matches last less than a minute if they even reach thirty-seconds. This was how duels were in real life, very quick, brutal affairs. The player has many tricks to use against AI and Humans alike...\n\nThe player has three stances, high, middle, and low. Each stance has it's own advantages and disadvantages. They have different purposes and different uses. Unlike Nidhogg, where each strike did the samething. Players can also parry, lock swords, and even charge/jump backwards.\n\n\n\nAll bleeding, friend and foe...\n...streams fading into river calm...\n...Finally we are one!\n-Ikeda Kanagonda\n\n\n\nGRAPHICS: The graphics of Kiai Resonance are not 'impressive' according to the current standard. However, they are in my opinion, amazing. It is in imitation of traditional Japanese art and fits the game's theme and feel perfectly. It is as if watching an animated painting, objects in the environment move as well.\n\nAlso, unlike Nidhogg, this game already has working multiplayer. Complete with a ranking system.\n\n\n\nBrothers around me...\n...Cherry Blossoms falling from trees...\n...The perfect death!\n-Point_Man\n\ndisclaimer: I totally got these haikus from the twcenter","April 23, 2015","true","2.5"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","18","21","2","0"

These modes combined with charge and jump back can make the game fall into the twitch game category, as you must strike from your stance at just the right moment: there is clearly some luck in there as well.\n\nEach stance is either a defence, counter strike or strike.\n\nI've just spent an hour playing the 'solo' portion of the game and found that the A.I. can be beaten quite easily, This is not a criticism as it would appear the real attraction of the game is the online component, which incidently has rankings: however I could not match up with anyone online [the game is afterall new, and I sincereley hope that people go online]\n\nThe solo play is IMHO only available so you can get a feel for the stances and movement. There is also a section with challenges that will assist in your quest to follow Bushido and become the ultimate Samurai - these challenges, actually are quite challenging.\n\nIf you like these sort of fighting games, get it. However it may be prudent to wait until it has some online action, as the solo and challenges will bore quickly.\n\nenjoy\n\n+cards\n+achievements","April 23, 2015","true","1.4"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","1"

There is also a local multiplayer for 2 players.\n\nThe online is really fun, but since the matches are user-hosted, if the player hosting has a bad connection lag can be awful, also, there are not much players yet, but everyday since its release there are more players on the scoreboard.\n\nThe visuals are beautiful, how some parts of the maps are animated, and some other are in a front layer, not all in the background, it really looks like a "living painting" with the warriors fighting. By the way, my favourite map is "Water" based on Tani Buncho's "Grasses and Moon" painting.\n\nThe soundtrack is wonderful, I think it suits every map so good (each map has its own), but things to be said, the menu song, despite being relaxing, can become repetitive to some, because it's a short simple melody, and if you have a long wait for an online match, you have to listen to it until you find a player (if you have music activated in the options)\n\nThe only bad thing I can say is that there's a lack of content, it would be nice to have some customization for the charachters, a "Challenge Editor" to make our own challenges and share them in the Workshop, more maps, for example.\n\nThere is one unlockable map, making them 4 maps in total.\n\nTo sum up, entertaining game, with more options than it may seem at first, it's a lot of fun when you learn "distracting techniques" and defeat a player with such tricks. The price is maybe a little high for the lack of content, but I do not think it is actually abusive.","April 26, 2015","true","8.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The skills and controls are simple to learn - the game is more about picking a stance and timing your attack than memorizing combos.\n\nThe content is somewhat limited. There is a reasonable tutorial, several challenges, and versus mode has a regular mode and a "rush" mode - in which both players run forward until they clash. That being said the game has enough content to be enjoyable, it would just be nice to see more.\n\nThe art and music is simple and fits in well with the game.\n\nKiai Resonance feels like it could be great with more content, however it is still fun as it stands. The price tag is very reasonable.\n\nYou're not likely to face any surprises - if the trailer looks appealing then you will enjoy the game.\n\nSubscribe to my curator page for more local multiplayer recommendations: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/7189360/\n\nCheck out my Couch Gaming group for specials, bundles, etc: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/CGLM\n","May 14, 2015","true","3.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

If you play through all the challenges, you unlock a 4th. There are 2 playable characters, both of whom are also the only available opponents. The only graphics option is "fullscreen: on/off", and the sound options are "sounds on/off" and "music on/off".\n\nThis probably sounds like a game which is lacking in content, and realistically, it probably is. That said, everything the game has is incredible. The music is simple, and helps set the mood. It's well-done, and not over-done like it very easily could have been. The menu and each stage have unique melodies that play, all fairly understated, and suited to the stage. The shouting voices of the fighters stands out against the music, as do the rare moments where blades clash. The hissing of blades cutting the air is audible as a counterpoint to the music, and the cound of a successful strike stands out as well. Turning the music off puts a measure of extra emphasis on the sound effects, making them seem to stand out more, and somehow giving the game a slightly different tone.\n\nAs for the gameplay itself, it's definitely "easy to learn, hard to master" - there are two buttons for movement, forwards and backwards. You can't jump, and the fighters only swap sides when you cross in a climactic final blow. There's also only one attack button, but you have 3 buttons to switch between stances, each of which has its own style of attack. This game doesn't involve complex combos or strings of attacks. There are no healthbars. You strike, once, and your opponent is dead. It's possible to clash a few times, it's possible to jump backwards and avoid a strike. But one hit will decide the fight. Sometimes two fighters will rush into one another immediately, and within a couple of seconds, there's blood-red ink dripping around the fallen as the victor sheathes his sword. Other times there will be a tense standoff, a few quick rushes where the fighters push one another back, or their blades clash, each testing the other's reactions before the decisive blow.\n\nIf you've watched a few samurai films or anime swordfights, you'll have seen times where two fighters dash past one another, both slashing with their weapons. There's a moment of sudden stillness where it's unclear who won, before a spray of blood and one of the fighters drops. This game's more intense fights frequently end that way. When you're one of the fighters, you can often pick the winner as the two fighters cross paths, knowing that your blow wasn't the one that landed. Even then, you know it was close.","May 1, 2015","true","29.8"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","5","10","0","0"

While that's not an entirely bad thing. Kiai seems to be missing a lot of the elements that made BB so damn fun.\n\nThere is no variation in the (only)2 characters you get to choose from. Sure that helps with balancing, but only because balancing isn't a thing when everyone is the same. However it kills the player's individuality & stymies gamer's creativity.\n\nThere are only 3 attacks & no options when it comes to fight or flight. Sure you can dodge back, but full on running away to lure the enemy into a disadvantageous position, makes for some crazy interesting battles. No projectiles, to throw your opponent off guard for a quick strike.\n\nNo limb damage, no jumping or using the terrain to your advantage, etc.\n\nContent is lacking in Kiai also. Only 3 stages & like the characters, they're just aesthetic differences.\n\nOnline seems to be dead.\n\nLook, I know Kiai isn't Bushido Blade & never pretended to be. My point is that Kiai is in the same vein as BB & while it does some things right, Kiai comes up a little short. The mind game & the quick twitch is there, but the variation in gameplay & content are lacking.\n\nA good example of a 2d game that got a lot of this right is Nidhogg.\n\n\nThis is an ok game, but one to pick up on sale. Also it wouldn't hurt to have a friend that is into this kind of game as well.","May 7","false","1.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Challenges are fun, but done in 15 minutes and while computer offers some challenge, it gets old quite fast. Online seems next to impossible to play, as timing is everything in this game and having even 100ms delay is going to make a huge difference here. Even hotseat, it is extremely hard to time counterattack right, seems pretty much not possible over internet.\n\nNext issue is that strike from jõdan is simply bit too easy and powerful versus other techniques. Game captures the feeling of a sword duel in very nice way. Deflecting blows should maybe work bit better though, it's much easier to parry a sword strike in real life than in this game.\n\nNone the less, very entertaining game for a while. The price is just right at around $5. This won't last forever as an entertainment, but has potential to offer quite fun hotseat duels for a while.\n\nWith slight strike balancing and a single player sidescrolling adventure this would be very good game. I do not dare to ask decent online experience though, it would kill the spirit of the game too easily if timing was made possible with any lag. Maybe a slider for game speed could come handy for online?","April 24, 2015","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some of the one player challenges, especially Echoes and Reflex Test can be really confusing/annoying, but they are easily passable, and the game in general takes very little getting used to. One complaint is that the online mode is very dry, it is extremely difficult to find a match since no-one seems to play. This makes it very difficult to for achievement hunting since most of them involve winning online matches. If you want to get the achievements, I would reccommend getting a friend to buy it as well and play at the same time so you can be sure there are online matches to join.","January 15","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
