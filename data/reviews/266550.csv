I hate to compare it to minecraft (voxel game) but that is the game everyone knows. It's more or less a battle minecraft with guns and the feeling you are in a mech. It's really fast-pased and looks like it has great promise. Now as I'm sure you know it's an early access so you'll see bugs here and there but they are on track for a great game. Dev gave me(and others) an early copy to help get these bugs out but i've had fun playing it while beta testing it as well.\n\nMy Rating 6/10 but this will change as more get added (Again it is in early access and they never to a full rating right away due to lack of features and content.","May 6, 2014","true","0.5"," 24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","24","29","0","0"

While they game had a good concept it has go nowhere extremely fast.

Offering a pair of well refined game modes. One requiring you to take back control of a military base and defend it against an invading Titan with it's hordes of voxel minions. Along with a more parkour target shooting map to challenge your mastery of the games core movement/jumping/aiming mechanics.\n\nObviously as an early access or alpha game there are several areas that need to be fleshed out yet. Given Wicked Loot's fast iterative development process to date, you can expect to see features added quickly in very refined form. Along with a very direct line to the players. Through active test community, developer livestreams, etc.\n\nYou can get a pretty good idea of the gameplay through the development videos in the community hub. Alternatively you can check out the early access preview I put together on youtube:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYA1rkOXjvE","May 8, 2014","true","3.9"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","16","18","0","0"

So if you have seen the game before (see screenshots in the Shop!), it did change quite a bit (It will change even more in the future). Afaik the art-direction will stay like that (might change a bit).\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-xIarvMjTc&noredirect=1 (6 parts of cluesless gameplay)\n\nI did play the older Versions too, but they are not representative anymore, so i cut that out at the end. Sorry, that´s the reason it has no real ending.\n\nI like the graphics and performance was ok. You have slow-downs when you activate Boost or many Enemies are around. Imho the game runs good and playable without bigger issues (AMD X6, 8GB Ram, GTX560Ti Oc). I had absolutely no crashes or really big bugs (Textures are flickering when in window-mode).\n\nTL/DR: Minecraft and "Drunken Robot Po.rnography" made a baby, while playing Super Mario on LSD. A lot of crazy fun and i can´t wait to get more of it and better and bigger Bosses (just saw one yet). There will be Minecraft-like crafting and building (Sandbox/Creative-Mode not integrated in 4.0) and Multiplayer.\n\nSo do i recommend it? Absolutely, if you want a crazy shooter (like explained above) and have the money to spare. If you´re not sure, where the journey will bring Spark Rising to, you should maybe wait for another update (the Dev is really quick afaik with integrating user-requested things, if they make sense though!).","May 7, 2015","true","4.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Impmaster/recommended/266550/","Impmaster","buymeawp.com ||  Impmaster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Impmaster/","56 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFirst of all, remember that this review is of the game in it's prealpha state, and as such, it obviously has a more restrained outlook on things like bugs and glitches. The game has just been released to early access, and that's so that the devs can get feedback on what feels right and what they can change. Don't expect it to be a fully fleshed out game. It's still in development. There are multiple bugs and little things that could be changed with the engine (the audio is quite odd in the boss fight, there seems to be really bad collision code...), but overall, the engine is fairly well fleshed out. In my thirteen minutes of play (unfortunately enough to see pretty much the whole game), I didn't crash or have any major lag issues.\n\nNow for the actual game design part. See, the game is all about driving your mech warriors in voxel landscapes and shooting stuff in various game modes. There will be a crafting mode in the future, where you can build levels using a voxel engine, however when i opened it I couldn't find how to build anything, so I'm assuming that the crafting mode isn't fully fleshed out yet. The voxel engine does two things mainly. It makes it so that you can destroy the terrain (always great fun, as there are nice particle effects when destroying things and also for the sheer sake of destroying), and the voxel engine also allows the player to craft. ATM, it's mainly destroying.\n\nThe main game mode is somewhat obtuse in what to do atm. You have to destroy certain objectives, in order to convert them to your side. I didn't know what these looked like until I realized that they were these small rods that you had to shoot. Once you have converted a few, the boss comes in from the sky. He's massive and certainly quite impressive, but the way he walks on the ground makes it obvious that this is an early alpha game. He somewhat floats to the highest block, and it doesn't really look realistic. Overall, the game mode is just a way for the developers to test out the engine and to demonstrate what the game might feel like when it is done.\n\nAtm, the game doesn't feel like much. It's basically a version of Hawken where the mech handling doesn't feel as nice (If you shoot out a 1 block wide wall you can walk in there. It feels like you're a small person with a mech shooting hand). However, I can see the potential in this game. I especially liked the feeling of verticality in the main level, as I could blow my way through the various obstacles while dodging shots and firing at the boss down below. However, staying on the ground was quite glitchy as I would bounce around the various cubes (Not exactly Minecraft movement so far).\n\nSo overall, would I recommend you buy this game? No, absolutely not in the state that it's in, unless you want to help design it. It's not at the level of the Minecraft alpha, where you already have a game. It's basically a tech engine with good potential. However, if you want to help design the game and give feedback on it, I suggest you get it.","May 8, 2014","true","0.3"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

I have seen any real updates or additions. If you've had the game as long as I have. You would feel as if the devs have completely forgotten about this game.

The game doens't come close.Even for early access alpha standards. And with no updates in the longest time. If this game is going to redeem its value.

It is mysterious, doesn't give you a mission from the first second. You have to explore and find a mission to start, usually by looking for a building.

The trailer shows something about making a fortress you can defend, maybe that's in multiplayer because i never saw that, but come to think of it, i dont remember there being a button in the menu for multiplayer. Maybe I missed it, didn't care since I would never play MP anyway.\n\nIt's voxel and random generated worlds. The generation part takes a while (much longer than it should given the size and lack of variety). So you are dumped on to this place with no indication what you are supposed to do, with this ghost like thing in front of you. It never speaks, but it does help shoot bad guys a little bit. Didn't do much besides get in the way of my vision. Then you run a little ways and you are supposed to shoot these "consoles" which are just large glowign blocks. Then a bunch of enemies spawn. Destroy all the consoles then get to the waypoint to escape to the next identically themed level. Enemies are pretty lame with a little variety. The magic guys are annoying. actually most of them are annoying, and not really difficult to take out. You have a machine gun that reloads very frequently, and a couple other alt shots you can pick up (one at a time). Watermelons were sticky bombs but being watermelons was kind of funny. There was a charge shot, a rail gun style shot, and a couple others i think.\n\nBeing voxel, you can destroy the terrain some, as well as enemies can when they drop bombs and such. Didn't really affect gameplay all that much though. Very colorful, but not texture to it. Just solid colors, which is good and bad in a way I guess.\n\nOh, and it's basically rogue-like, in that you die and you start again at level 1. Though I don't know if that matters much since the levels I played seemed more or less identical anyway.\n\nAnyway, overall, not worth my time. It's in early access, but I dont think there would be enough improvement in gameplay style to interest me in the future.","October 9, 2015","false","0.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Get this game now! 5/5.","May 14, 2014","true","0.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's a bit barebonesy. If you buy this. Please expect to make your own content to play with due to the fact that there is little to no gameplay here aside from two ''levels'' and one mech (it seems that the other two are WIP). The soundtrack consists of only 4 tracks, I know this as I got the soundtrack as a bonus. The weapons in game are a bit weird, and by weapons in the plural form. I mean just one weapon that has two forms of attacks, one normal attack and one heavy attack. The UI is nice but the Ammo Counter sticks out like a sore thumb.\n\nThe lack of difficulty choice angers me as it really means that I just have to sprint to a beacon, destroy it to make friendly, do the rest without fighting and then fight the weak titans. Beating a level does not feel accomplishing.\n\nIf you want this game; wait until the future where it's a bit better. Or buy now and be sure to make your own fun.","June 10, 2014","false","0.7"," 11 of 24 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","11","24","0","0"

I eagerly await the story mode in a future update as that will add a large quantity of content to improve the game. The provided modes currently are all excellent, but for the free build mode could have more to construct a fort with. Overall worth it and I'm excited to see where this goes, seeing as it's pre-alpha.","June 29, 2014","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are a few things that really take away from it for me, namely the use of familiar sounds and game sprites that are easy to tell they are designed after other popular titles. I don't see enough in the game to say it is inspired from classics. It just seems a few random sounds and sprites in the small amount I played.","January 19","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'd have refunded my two dollars if it had been, because this game is not what it tries to sell itself to be.  The arenas right now are these tiny areas.. where there's a never ending spawn of boxy bad guys that come in.  Destructable terrain?  Yes, it's there---doesn't really mean much because the map is so small that you hardly invest any feelings on the destruction.  "Dynamically changing arena"?  Hardly.  It's a small place that's got you cramped in, and hiding between the sorta-space-ish looking structures while you try to get your shots in.  I'd call it unfinished, but it's not even that... it's not even something you could call a game right now as there's no point to anything you're doing in it.\n\nEdit:  Also, don't trust that lying trailer.  You can't build jack-crap in this game "yet", as if it'll ever be implemented.","May 23","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
