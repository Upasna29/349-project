"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Delphaeus/recommended/323610/","Delphaeus","TOG | Delphaeus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Delphaeus/","381 products in account","This is a great game, albeit with a few significant problems.\n\nThe Gameplay is the best part of it, where you have to simultaneously deploy and manage multiple response units including firemen/firetrucks, Ambulances/Paramedics, Police, Negotiators, Salvage vehicles etc.\n\nYou start in a suburban area where you respond to numerous events. The game quickly manages to scale up and has you managing multiple units at the same time, in different areas of the city, all earning you money to purchase new equipment. When you have the required equipment it unlocks a "mission" that takes you into a separate "mission map" and you get a more complex mission. When you complete the mission it takes you back to the suburban area again, to manage more random events until you have purchased the required hardware for the next mission.\n\nThis gameplay is quite fun, and even though it is the same incidents, the map is quite large and always has you thinking on "where is the nearest hydrant?", "what resources do i need for that?" or "where is that criminal running?" so each incident is still quite unique.\n\nNow, the "significant problems" I mentioned earlier (from least significant to most significant)\n\nFirstly: Audio is ok. It repeats a lot of things a lot of times and has some interesting things (like every vehicle you click on sounds the "ambulance sirens", even if you click on a car on the side of the road)\n\nSecondly: Graphics are ok. It doesn't have any options above 1024x1280 and on a full HD display it is somewhat grainy, but I don't think this significantly detracts from the game\n\nThirdly: When doing the more complex "Mission scenario" I still haven't found a way to restart it without quitting to windows. So when you make a big stuff-up and all your firemen are dying with a wall of fire between them and the paramedics, you actually have to deal with the situation... or you quit to desktop and start the game again\n\nNext: Each individual will not really do anything unless you have told them to. ie: A fireman will watch a fire burn, unless you have told him to equip an extinguishing device (hose or extinguisher) and is within range. If a fire moves out of range, he won't follow it. Same goes for Paramedics and Police. I'd love to see a little bit of automation, such as: tell the fire-truck to "CONTAIN" the fire and they setup automatically to stop the fire spreading, or tell the paramedics to "TREAT" the casualty, and when he is ready for transport they should automatically load him into the ambulance and take him away.\n\nOh, and firement shouldn't stand in one fire when trying to fight another fire... yeah this can happen.\n\nLastly: Traffic routing. If you order ten ambulances (yes, i made a few mistakes fighting a fire once) and tell them where to go, after the first two arrive, then the others keep driving around in circles because they can't get to the spot where the first two ambulances parked. Sometimes they'll drive around a building on fire and blow up because they are trying to get to that exact spot.\n\nAnd sometimes they get "jammed" because they drove too close to a pedestrian and then you have to manually "unjam" them so they can drive again. (not too common)\n\nBut, all in all, a good, enjoyable game, just be warned that some things are frustrating\n\n\n","September 27, 2014","true","4.9"," 46 of 52 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","46","52","0","3"

Using these, it's up to the user to deal with a number of disasters in the main campaign ranging from simple fires to earthquakes, hostage situations, airline disasters and more! Alternatively, the user can play an endless mode in which they must deal with random emergencies which will grant them the finances to purchase more vehicles and deal with bigger disasters. One great aspect is you're not penalized for doing a bad job so if you get bored, you can use your police units to cause havoc.\n\nThe game is easy to get into but difficult to master as controlling a number of different emergency units can quickly become overwhelming. The assets have also aged well since release.\n\nEmergency 4 is definitely a unique game and is an often looked over gem, it's a game that is both engaging and enjoyable, even if you're not a fan of Real Time Strategies.\n\nAdditionally, the game is VERY moddable. The 'LA Mod[losangelesmod.com]' is definitely recommended as it adds dozens of additional units and missions.\n\nTo put it simply, this game is a must play and for the price it's being offered at, it's definitely worth grabbing. There are rumors of emegency 5 being released next month (October 2014) and hopefully it's a better game than the poorly done Emergency 2012/2013/2014 games and hopefully, the release of Emergency 4 on Steam is a good sign of Emergency 5 being released on Steam sometime soon.","September 25, 2014","true","3.2"," 42 of 56 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","42","56","0","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cubejackal/recommended/323610/","cubejackal","CubeJackal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cubejackal/","272 products in account","At first glance, this game might look like those abysmal simulator games that you find decorating the local GameStop's bargain bin and the Steam Greenlight page in equal measure. However, 911: First Responders couldn't be more different. What appears to be a mild-mannered and simple simulation is a surprisingly realistic and hair-pullingly tough game of skill and judgement that plays out more like an RTS than a traditional sim. Well-researched subject material, a lengthy and challenging campaign, and exquisite sound and music design go hand-in-hand to create this gem of a game that deserves far more recognition than first appearances might suggest.\n\nIn 911: First Responders, the player assumes the role of an emergency dispatcher in an unidentified, accident-prone urban sprawl somewhere in Europe - presumably the Netherlands, considering where developers Sixteen Tons Entertainment hail from. It's your sole duty to command and micro-manage emergency responders of all professions and roles, ranging from police marksmen to fire department marine divers to tow truck technicians. The mammoth campaign is comprised of twenty assignments that are broken up by short sessions of responding to low-level emergency calls inside the city, with each success granting the player some of the funds needed to buy vehicles and upgrades that are imperative for the next big assignment. Though they start out easy enough, these large-scale missions quickly become damningly hard and will push even experienced RTS players to their multi-tasking, micro-managing limits. A very wide range of emergency situations and responses are represented in loving detail, giving the game just enough complexity to be engaging without being overwhelming to people who aren't educated in emergency service operations - despite the plethora of vehicles and personnel on hand, most of the tools the player is given have an obvious and easily comprehensible application. The open-ended nature of each assignment is also something to be noted and applauded - though some missions may have clear solutions, others require creative use of the tools at your disposal in order to save  as many lives as possible.\n\nOf course, fun as it is, the game isn't flawless. The eight-year-old graphics can't help but show their age upon close examination (though they aren't 'bad' by any means), and the pathfinding of the game's larger vehicles can become problematic in enclosed areas - which feature heavily in some assignments, occasionally resulting in Tetris-like scenes in which the player must manually guide their confused emergency vehicles out of a tight spot in order to release an urgently-needed automotive at the bottom of the metaphorical heap. The game also has a nasty habit of giving the player new tools or personnel without giving much notification, which wouldn't be so bad if those new tools and personnel didn't tend to play very critical roles in the mission in which you're given them. One notable example is the fifth assignment, in which the player must clean up after a road bridge collapse - a task in which the fire brigade's marine divers are essential for locating sunken cars in the river below. The game, of course, doesn't tell you that it's given you these divers, so they're easy to miss when you're loading up a fire engine to send onto the map.\n\nThese flaws, however, pale greatly against the immense fun that I've been having with this game so far. The surprisingly steep challenges that it offers seriously surprised me as I progressed further into the campaign, and part of what motivates me to overcome every nail-bitingly tense challenge and assignment is my curiosity over what the next assignment will hold.  At the asking price of £3.99, this game is an absolute steal for its quality and a must for strategy fans and anyone who's enthusiastic about the work of the emergency services. Definitely get this game.","November 15, 2014","true","8.0"," 21 of 21 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","21","21","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ViperZeroOne/recommended/323610/","ViperZeroOne","ViperZeroOne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ViperZeroOne/","274 products in account","911: First Responders is one of those little gems you pick up in the “dollar bin” not realizing what you’ve found, let it sit on your shelf for a few months, and when you finally get around to playing it you almost feel like you owe it an apology.\n\nWhile this isn’t the best emergency response game I’ve ever played it is one of the most well rounded.  In a 911 title you’d expect to have units from the Police, Fire, and Medical fields but this game goes further.  It also brings in services like clean-up wreckers and specialty vehicles.  In addition, all of your vehicles have their specific roles to play in combating the events that occur in your city.\n\nIf I had one thing to nitpick about this game it would be that it’s too busy, specifically in the “nonstop” mode.  This mode is almost like a sandbox where you are given event after event to deal with.  The problem here is that occasionally an event is so complicated, like a bush fire, that it takes you a while to deal with it.  While combating that bush fire you may end up getting assigned another fire, or a police action.  This leaves you either losing ground in your complicated task while you deal with the others, or ignoring the others and completing your complicated task.  The limit on how many vehicles you can have active at once also hinders the ability to deal with multiple emergencies\n\nThings get a little better in multiplayer mode, but not much.  Yes, there is a multiplayer mode.  In this mode you and a friend can tackle emergencies in the same city.  The only downside here is that the ability to dispatch new vehicles is turn-based.  Players have to have good communication and use excellent team work in “passing the torch” so their partner can help dispatch vehicles to emergencies without delay.  Once the vehicles are on the map, however, you don’t need control of dispatch in order to maneuver them around.  You do, however, need to return them to headquarters so vehicles are available for other emergencies.\n\nGraphically this game is pretty good.  The game plays out in a somewhat 3D map view of the entire city.  You can easily use the mini-map to jump around the city, or scroll off the side with your mouse.  The level of detail is pretty good, as you’ll find yourself needing to access everything from equipment in the vehicles to fire hydrants.  Doors have to be broken down.  Hostages have to be rescued.  Fire victims have to be rescued from buildings.  Injured have to be extricated from vehicles and treated by medics.  It’s a fairly involved game for the graphics being so “zoomed out”.  I never really found myself fighting the camera, it was fairly easy to control and rotate around structures.\n\nSound in the game got somewhat repetitive after a while.  There is one announcement for each type of emergency, and it’s repeated every time the specific emergency happens.  Music is fast paced but also gets a little repetitive at times.  Still, it suits the theme of the game and brings in a little bit of excitement.\n\nAll in all… I have to refer to my opening statement.  When I got this game I wasn’t expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised.","January 20","true","5.2"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","19","20","3","0"

Time to time, however, a pregenerated larger scale operation will pop up which will certainly require a combined operation. For example in the first and second one you will need both medics and firefighters - with gasmasks in the second, while you need medics, criminal profilers and marksmen in the third. All in all, I have no problems with the variety of missions so far.\nBut the game has problems. The most important - for me - is that it lacks active pause; when you stop the time, you cannot issue orders. Many would say "it's called real-time for a reason", but I would answer: "If it was real-time strategy then an ambulance would reach its destination in 30 minutes or so, and not within seconds. So let's call these accelerated time strategy, and as such, they need active pause. Especially when you have to act for all your men and women, because they will apathetically suffocate in a smoke-filled building should you not order them outside." And with that last sentence we reached the topic of AI.\nWell, it's simple, and not without problems. For example the firemen will target the nearest fire within a few a meters when they have a hose in their hands, but will gladly try to take the longer route to reach their assigned target, even if that way the hose will be too short. So don't try to send them on longer journeys unattended, which means a lot of micromanagement when your hands would be full even with a more proactive crew.\nAnother problem is that they just don't seem to comprehend the gravity of these emergencies. For example, in the third mission I had six marksmen ordered to riddle two mobsters with bullets. The culprits were of course running towards the edge of the map, and my unit of cold professionals, the tip of the spear, the edge of the knife, the crack of my ... eh... were walking after them. And I don't mean they did not take a vehicle or something, I mean that they simply did not feel like running. I had to order a donut-eating patrolman into the criminals path, and - luckily - they immediately opened fire on him, giving enough time to my SWAT team to finish sightseeing and catch up with them. My condolences to the widow, her husband died a heroic, although otherwise completely avoidable death. Bleh.\n\nI think that's all I could say about the game. The sounds are okay and the graphics are, well, there. I mean you won't drop your chin, unless the most recent game you played is Defender of the Crown, but it's not bad at all. Long story short, as I mentioned before the game has its own share of sometimes hair-thinning problems, and I would hesitate to call it a good buy should I have paid 20€ or so for it, but for 5€ it's a bargain.","November 15, 2014","true","2.1"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","14","14","4","0"

The civilians have no regard for their own safety and routinely stand close to cars about to explode, etc.  When you block a civilians path say closing off the scene of an accident, it will continually spawn civilians until the FPS absolutely tanks.  The AI pathfinding is poor, and even still there are a fair amount of glitches with hoses and other core game mechanics.\n\nRegardless, especially playing the LA mod the idea of controlling the different services is absolutely intoxicating.  Even taking the game online to control only one service with your friends makes for some of the best team play.

Only a matter of opinion of course, but installing the LA Mod (introduces American Reponses Vehicles, with 4-5 other friends, getting together in multiplayer and working to keep the peace, and the city safe is quite challenging. Especially when working with each player who is specializing in one type of Emergency response. I end up spending hours playing this game with friends, as every scenario plays out differently. Though the same map can be a bit bland after many hours of gameplay, taking a small break, then popping back into another match playing a different role greatly changes things up. Definitely a must buy if you have friends to play with.\n\nMultiplayer is a bit sketchy at best. If you can’t connect via the traditional server browser,  installing Hamachi or another similar type service works like a charm, providing you and the other player have everything installed the same way (referring to mods). For $5 it is a must buy and provides hours of fun.","September 29, 2014","true","6.5"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","1"

But with some positive points.\n\nAllow me to clarify:\n\nI see a lot of positive reviews for this game, and I know it was a product of its era, but I really struggle to wrap my brain around this one. Aside from a few issues where save games were mysteriously deleted, I found that before I could get my hands on a campaign mission I had to wade through inane emergency after inane emergency.\n\nQuick! Someone's had a fall and has a minor injury! (A minor injury? Like a sprained ankle? Fine, they can wait while I tend to the three fires going on and the pickpocket on the loose) - I return a minute or two later and find that the person had DIED from their minor injury\n\nI eventually did get into the campaign and tried the first two 'levels' - but really it seems that there is a formula for dealing with them, and deviating *at all* makes things difficult.\n\nPathfinding is ridiculous - roads are a mere suggestion - and I know there's the ages-old argument about depth vs simplicity, but requesting a fire truck, then waiting for it, then selecting it when it arrives, then clicking near to the fire emergency, then asking your firefighters to get out, then asking your firefighters to equip themselves with fire hoses, then asking your firefighters to attach their equipped fire hoses to separate fire hydrants dotted around the area, THEN finally asking them to put out the fire (Though the hitbox often means you end up cooling a building and not attacking the fire), it does get rather tiresome. When the fire is out , reasonably you'd expect them to tackle any other fires in their immediate vicinity, but no, they will stand about and wait for the order - often while you're doing other things - so the fire spreads yet further. THEN once the fire is out, you tell your firefighters to disconnect the hoses, put the gear away, then get back in the vehicle before either shuttling them to the next fire or sending them back to HQ.\n\nIt is very difficult to manage time in this game, and completing campaigns often means failing them often enough until you know the formula. It's a very stressful game at the best of times!\n\nI really can see the appeal, and Hardcore RTS fans may very well be all over this, but this game is not for me, and certainly not one I'd recommend for the casual or average gamer...!\n\nTHAT ALL SAID - apparently there are plenty of mods which make this game a lot more playable. To those who have time for such endeavours - I wish you luck!\n\nAs usual, I have documented my progress in the form of a video playlist:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dC1vQ3C6bM0","May 26, 2015","false","2.1"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","10","16","2","0"

A challenging Singleplayer Campaign will see you rescue hostages, extinguish forest fires, deliver humanitarian aid in a 3rd world country and even fight chemical disasters. The games engine is outdated by now and pathfinding of units is sluggish at best but it's still pleasing to look at your units rushing down the roads flashing their sirens. You will be able to take control of the Police, Fire Brigade, Medical Services and even technical help centres that can tow vehicles, use cranes to get crashed vehicles out of rivers, SAR Helicopters, Technicians to fix broken traffic lights and railroad crossings and much more. The game still has a very active modding community. Truly the best aspect of the game however is it's multiplayer with its challenge and endless mode. You can team up with 3 other people to take control of a city's emergency forces and help prevent disaster... and you'll know disaster when a riot starts or a chemical plant catches on fire, you'll need good co-ordination of all forces to make it through.\nA great multiplayer, an alive modding community and very fun gameplay make up for the small bugs you can encounter here and there. It's cheap and it's fun. If you always wanted to see how well you can manage emergency forces (by yourself or with 3 friends!), give it a go! 4.5/5","October 17, 2014","true","16.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

All missions are challenging, which is nice, and some require to use all 4 departments (Fire, Medic, Police and Engineering) to complete a mission. I believe in one mission (I think its from the LA mod) you had to use the engineers to get into an airport because the gates were locked.\n\nGreat game, I grabbed it for 50% and I must say it was a steal!\n\nEdit 2 (adding more info and what not): Recently installed NYC, London and US Army mods. Great mods! NYC and London are fantastic, however the US Army mod is too much for me man... too complex. ;)\n\nNonetheless, I love the London mod. Probably my favourite mod, since I live in the UK. Modding this game is easier than modding GTA 4 if anyone played that... as simple as opening up an installer and selecting a file. Boom!\n\nThis game offers a wide range of callouts, and the campaign has some really fun missions (currently just finished mission 4). There is a total of 20 missions, and some mods, like the LA mod offers additional missions if you wish to do those. Between each mission is a period of free play, where you respond to a variety of fire, medic and police calls throughout the city to get funds to buy vehicles to help in the next mission(s). Outside of the campaign you have free mode and challenge mode. Free mode is basically the same thing as the inbetween missions bit, but there are no missions but just call outs, which I like (it is what I play all the time so) and challenge mode... haven't tried that yet, but I will give it a go. Might be fun, who knows?\n\nUpdate 1: 14/02/15\n\nPlayed a little bit, still with London Mod. Ohh man this mod is amazing! Since I'm new to the Emergency series I don't know how to tackle half the calls so I ended up calling in 3 armed response vehicles to an illegal demonstration. topg.\n\nNonetheless I am still to try Challenge mode. Will try that when I have time, if I don't forget. Also I should play more of the campaign missions, I'm only on like... 4, maybe 5?\n\nWill update review as I progress through this fun game ;)","January 4, 2015","true","26.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

This one just happened to get modded.\n\nMore importantly, this game has ALL the path finding issues, stupid AI, broken missions (The hacker mission is particularly broken) as the newer emergency games BUT it also has atrocious controls and delegation methods, at least the newer games fixed that. You have to wonder if people mindlessly praise this game while mindlessly bashing the others is only because this game isn't called by its original name of Emergency 4....\n\nIt's a decent game with many critical flaws but it's certainly no Emergency or Emergency 2 or even 3.

I really want to like this game and can see the appeal, and i'd love to get as far as the airport level shown in the screenshots. However so far it seems to be more of a speed clicking, click, click, click game and remember where all the buttons are and clicking on all items as quickly as possible along with people route finding that does not always do what I want it to do. Graphics are OK for an almost 10 year old game, and what I had read sequels are much worse with less options and more buggy than this one. I might change this after playing more, but this game just does not seem like it is for me.","December 5, 2015","false","2.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I'm not exactly one to write an essay about games. So. If you like this game, don't get it, get a different game. I have it in my library, I think it's called "Emergency 20XX (It gave me multiple versions" and there's another one, get these instead. At least in those games. The ambulances RETURN after taking patients to the hospital, this allows you to avoid calling 10000 ambulances when you don't need them. They have all the same units. You may even think they are identical (Part of the reason I got the game), but the other games are pretty much just a more polished version of this game.","March 11","false","0.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","2"

I am saying all of this based on very limited playtime because I cannot proceed past a certain point early in the game, hence the afore-mentioned predictable crash.

After you play a little bit everything becomes clustered, bad traffic, cars become frozen in place, most useful commands can only be used by host. If other use commands the stuff dissapears for all the other players.\n-Very hard to find players\n-Map doesnt load properly for half people, have to diable all shadows.\n-Jump in a coop game and you cant move your units around, you have to quit and reload game.\n-Directing traffic works half of the time.\n\n\nThis game has a huge learning curve on how to play around major bugs.","October 5, 2014","false","11.4"," 3 of 27 people (11%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","11","3","27","0","0"

In Emergency 4, you take on the role of the Chief of Police, Director of EMS, Fire Chief, and Technical Coordinator. You dispatch units to a call whether it involves crime, medical emergencies, fires, or simply a traffic light failure. You even all four of them for traffic accident, and many other emergencies! I'd recommend downloading the LA Mod for this game, as although the European version is satisfying, the LA Mod is 500x more satisfying and contains almost 200% more units than the vanilla version of Emergency 4. I recommend this game to all lights/sirens enthusiasts; police lovers; Fire and EMS lovers; and even people who are police officers, EMT's, and firefighters in the real world!","April 19, 2015","true","46.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Actually, this game isn't very simple, in fact, it is one of the hardest games I have ever played, and by far one of the best! 911: First Responders, also known as Emergency 4, is a unique RTS about being incontrol of a City's Police, Fire Department, Emergency Medicle Services, and Technical crew as you save lives time and time agian, or atleast try.\n\n911 FR has a variety of very interesting, and hard, missions, which combined can give you up to 25+ hours of campaign time. However, that is by far not it. There is also freeplay mode, where you can protect your city endlessly, something you can easily pour many hours into, and I have. It may say up above that I only played 30 hours of this game, but I have really spent upto mabey a thousand hours.\n\nThis game also has many spectacular mods, including the Los Angeles Mod by Hoppah, which relocates the game to LA. I cannot recomend that mod enough! So essentialy, buy this game! It has very few problems, such as rare bugs or glitches, but those pale in comparison to how great this game is!","December 17, 2015","true","125.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But, if you are looking for a game to play vanilla, 911: First Responders is not the game for you, there is very little unit variety in the base game. But, I would recommend this game to any strategists who enjoy a unit-management type game.","July 6, 2015","true","88.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is still extremely playable, even in this age. I enjoyed the full range of vehicles and the spectrum of which you could control everything. This game leaves it up to you to solve the problem, and doesn't hand you the answer. While it does lack in missions for the police and swat, it makes up for in giving you in depth gameplay to every single disaster that occurs. I'll be happy to enjoy this game for many hours to come.","December 3, 2015","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Then this is a perfect game for you. Commanding Police, Fire, Medical, and Technical services to maintain order and save lives over a long campaign of varying missions. To maximise your enjoyment, I recommend the LA Mod, as while the default game is good on its own (depending on how you look at it), it improves the game with features that make you think "Why wasn't this implemented in the first place?".\n\nThe only downsides I can think of is that this game can get very stressful and demanding.
