Here are the controls, which are not at all mentioned in game:\n\nWASD to move around, use the mouse to look around\n\narrow keys for tank controls, where U and D move forward and back while L and R rotate\n\nESC to exit the game\n\nR to restart the game\n\nspace to jump\n\nleft click to attack\n\nhold control to crouch\n\nhold shift to run\n\nWhen you click the black box under "start", the game will freeze. Don't worry, it is just loading. There is no loading screen.\n\nBasically all this is is a physics sandbox. There are objects which you can push around without any purpose to it at all.\n\nThere is not much more that can be said about this game. There's not much variety, like in the similar game Goat Simulator. it would not take you very long to count every single object in the game. The fact that this game is not in early access is astounding. The developers have released it on steam as a full game. There have been games made in 48 hour game jams with more content than this. I'm not trying to be funny, I mean that literally. It takes less than a minute to walk across the entire map.\n\nIt's like someone was just playing around with the Unreal game engine and decided to charge money afterwards for nothing. Even after being off of steam for several months, very little has changed. I'm disappointed that this got approved to be on steam - twice. Please keep in mind that if you play the game for under 2 hours, you can get a refund through steam's refund system. You can choose "I didn't like this game" as the reason, the refund will be approved.","November 17, 2015","false","0.8"," 1,481 of 1,592 people (93%) found this review helpful 67 people found this review funny","93","481","1","67","36"

You can't see any options, so you have to guess on the controls. The starting screen is bland and only consists of two buttons "start" and "exit". the buttons are only black rectangles with the words above them.\nThe game world is dull and REALLY small. It's dullness made it feel like I was in a dystopian world. But not the dystopian worlds you see in books, movies, and other games. This world has no wonder in it. And the map is so small that you can see everything in less than a minute.\nThe parkour only consists of pressing the space bar, and you hardly ever even go to where you want your character to go. The "physics" are horrible. Last time I hit someone, they didn't go flying into the wall and get stuck in it while glitching out. And there is really nothing to do in this game besides headbutt things for no reason. you feel no sense of achievement from doing anything. 90% of the time, my game lags like crazy simply because of the girl's hair flying all over the place.\nThe graphics are bad too. I could probably play this on my Atari.\n\nOn the upside, there is a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• shaped bush on the sidewalk.\n\nBut no, this isn't worth the $5 it's asking for. I wouldn't even get it if it were free.","November 17, 2015","false","0.2"," 343 of 393 people (87%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","87","343","393","12","1"

I've already requested a return, though, and steam won't let me play it unless I buy it again, so I'm going to leave this for other folks as a record of my '‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•' experience with this game.

This game is a barren wasteland.  If I find out that there is more than just a couple streets to walk on, I'll reconsider my review.  If there were a half dozen different maps this size and you could warp between them or have mod support like Goat Simulator does, this might actually be a really good game.

There is only one map. That map is extremely small. You can explore the whole map in less than five minutes. There is also a very limited set of items. The discription of the game in the about the game section says that the  physics engine is buggy, and that is completely true. Because of this I hope they will add more to the game and it will become better. The game does not even have an options menu or a control list I asume they will add more as there is more to the game. I would enjoy the game if there was more to it, but for now I would say not to buy it. Wait for more updates to come out before you get it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/modrzej/recommended/415950/","modrzej","Niaouli","http://steamcommunity.com/id/modrzej/","91 products in account","Now, before we begin, I have to point out that I'm a long-time little girl, doing my best to become as littlegirlish as it is technically possible, and while I understand I might not be completely correct, I know I am about right.\n\nI know and understand the need for a little girl simulator, and I am very glad that it at least tried to come to reality. However, if it at any point was successful, it wasn't Yohjo Simulator.\n\nThis game lacks about everything a little girl shall possess and be able to do, everything a little girl should surround herself (or be surrounded) with. The world she has access to is a small, urban location. A few streets and alleys near the center of a city, not even a pretty one. It's filled with unsignificant trash, which happens to be her only toys. If us little girls want to do anything at all, we have to push crates and planks, or jump on a table, because the only thing, other than those, that we can interact with are people. And we don't want to interact with them, because then they turn into ragdolls and are thrown far away by the power of our heads.\nThe game's location, in context of little girls, is completely out of place. Of course, little girls and toys is a good general idea, but why play with building materials (and only them)? Why is the only thing our little girl is able to do a headbutt?\nMy theory is that the author played too many Goat Simulator, or whichever other maymay crap. I don't want it behind my loli escapist stone walls.\nThose walls surround an evergreen grassland with a wooden house somewhere in the middle, a pond to the side, and huge garden, where all the prettiest flowers are growing, the friendly animals are hanging out, and the naked men are hiding in the bushes. Looking, but not touching, and not being able to be touched.\nWhile japanese school outfits are a good start for this kind of game, wearable apparel should in no case be limited to just one, a gym outfit. There are so many things a little girl can put on herself, from frills to lace, and in everything she looks great. A terrible display, when you can't even flatter a loli's body with pretty clothes in a game about being a loli.\nThere is much more to life than beating things with your forehead. There's no happiness coming from that. A game about little girls should bring people happiness, and what's a better choice to achieve that than cuddling? Imagine laying on a soft blanket with your fluffy little fox friend, cuddling lovingly. Jumping, out of nowhere, on your online loli buddy, tickling her near death. When she has no energy to fight back left, hug her tightly and don't let go. And then eat a cake, hungry from playing around. The default action a little girl should perform is cuddling, not hitting. As an example, of course, as there are many more activities that bring people happiness.\nI can imagine someone telling me otherwise, that pain makes them feel good, and let me tell you why I don't care - it's a game where you self-insert as the purest being known to man, not a guy whose name is not important.","November 18, 2015","false","0.4"," 42 of 66 people (64%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","64","42","66","8","5"

Same with the outfits, allow the user to change outfits whenever they want, or, you have to find outfits, and once you unlock them, you unlock them forever (until you reset the map i guess).

The novelty of playing a loli only goes so far. So why recommend it at all? Well, there's a small nugget of a game somewhere. The parkour system the loli has is interesting, but needs polish. After getting used to it, I could platform and flip all over the map to reach ridiculous heights. You drop five bucks for what's essentially a gag out of a recent Comiket to parkour around, it's not really a problem for me. Start pushing anywhere above ten dollars and we have  a problem.\n\nToo many parts of me wish this was a more robust game with more secrets.
