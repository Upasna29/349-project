The music is great, gives it that authentic noir feeling. Not much in the way of puzzles, and I can see more happening in the later acts, but it can take a second to figure out exactly what you need to do next. A nice touch, since nothing should be overly easy.\n\nThe dialogue and story can be a bit hard to follow at first, due to the nature of the protagonist, but as you start to identify with them, it picks up fairly well. No in-game volume slider, but that can usually be adjusted computer-side.\n\nAll-in-all, looking forward to seeing more of this game, and perhaps even more of the developer. I wouldn't mind seing a full series based on this game's lore, or perhaps multiple different series. :)","July 29, 2014","true","4.6"," 53 of 64 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","53","64","0","0"

What I have played of act 1 was incredible and I loved it. However the game was released on 30th July 2014. As I am writing this it is now 9th March 2015. Almost 8 months since it was released and I have seen no sight of act 2. There is no release date and in all the announcements posted since the games release they barely cover anything about act 2.\nThis is an unnacceptable amount of time to wait for the new act to be released.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ferencmato/recommended/313360/","ferencmato","Pickles Giggles","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ferencmato/","275 products in account","NOTE: This review only covers Act 1 and it will be updated after acts 2 and 3 are added into the game.\n\nI'll be honest, I'm not really into point&click adventure games. There always seems to be something that ruins the experience for me - puzzles that don't make any sense, hidden objects, actions that take forever to perform, bad voice acting, etc. It's a good thing then, that I've had none of those problems with TME, although it's by no means perfect.\n\nTME is set in a  retro-futuristic dystopian world, where it never seems to stops raining, and where apparently both flying taxicabs and vinyl LP records are still totally relevant. It screams technoir. Visualy, it's a nice mix of a first person view and a comic book panels as a way of telling a story. Although the artwork quality is somewhat inconsistent in some scenes (especially towards the end of the first act), it's still very atmospheric and enjoyable. That's actually the thing this game is very good at - creating an atmosphere. The aesthetic fits the setting perfectly. The soundtrack is also really good and helps a whole lot in that regard. The combination of electronic music and jazz reminds me of Gunpoint OST (one of my favorite game soundtracks).\n\nObviously, I don't want to talk about the plot that much, so I won't spoil it for others. The little I can tell  you is that the game starts as you wake up in an abandoned building with no memory of who you are. You will need some help to figure out what's going on in the world around you…\nWhile it's not the best writing I've seen in a game, nor is it original, I found myself very invested in the story and I can't wait for the rest.\nWhat I really have to mention are the characters. The writing and the character design work so well together, making every character a unique, memorable personality.  Sadly, there's no voice acting, it's all just hypertext. It could've been so much better, but then again, I'll rather have no voice acting, than a bad one…\nGameplay-wise, there's not much to talk about, really. It's a very casual game, with only a few easy puzzles, just enough to keep you engaged. There are of course dialogues, but from what I can tell, there are no bad answers. That's kind of a weird thing to me - making hypertext, story driven game with totally linear narrative...Sigh. To be fair though, devs claim that it will get more interesting an non-linear in the next act.\n\nAs of now, the game consists of Act 1 and two additional very short stories (related to two of the characters you meet in the first act). It only took me 2 hours to play through, and that comes from someone who likes to take his time, read everything properly and enjoy the scenery. You could definitely run through it in an hour or so.\nThat brings up an important question - is it worth the price? At this point, I'm not so sure. These season-pass-kind-of-deals are always risky. Considering how short the story is, Act 2 release is long overdue, which is not helping the situation. At least devs still seem to be working on it instead of just dropping the ball, so that's good to know.\nRight now, I would either recommend you to get it in a bundle (like I did) or a sale, or maybe just wait a bit.\n\nConclusion\n\nIf you like cyberpunk/technoir genre and visual novels, and you don't mind reading, there's a good chance that you'll enjoy the short TME experience - as long as you'll treat it as a visual novel, not the game. It's not very original, but still  atmospheric and intriguing. I'm definitely looking forward to see more of that world and hear more of that great soundtrack. Again, bear in mind that this isn't a complete game, and that the full price may not be adequatte at this moment (as I mentioned in a previous paragraph).\nIf nothing else, it made me watch Blade Runner yet once again, so that's a plus I guess…","May 18, 2015","true","2.2"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","16","24","3","8"

At the time of writing this review, there have been two extra vignettes released, both of which are meant to be extremely quick, supplemental material. They each take around five minutes to complete. Be advised, the game is a three-part series, and I assume that owners of the game will receive the other 2 segments when they are released.\n\nIf you like graphic novels, sci-fi dystopian themes, and super casual gameplay, then you will enjoy this game.\n\nThe aesthetics are very good - the detail in the environment and art style are both well-done. The music is also good, and adds to the atmosphere of the game. The story is pretty interesting, although it is nothing elaborate or intricate (granted, I have read A LOT of fantasy and sci-fi). I look forward to trying out the next instalments.\n\nAs a point-and-clicker, the game runs mostly like a graphic novel, with some dialogue options and very simple puzzles. That being said, the controls are super easy to understand. The learning curve is minimal, however, there is one "main" puzzle that took me a few minutes to figure out.  I had thought that the keypad grid required you to connect EVERY letter to its corresponding number (ex: A -> 1, B -> 2, etc), which is absolutely impossible.\n\nDuring gameplay, most of the "puzzles" can be solved intuitively, and the game provides a fair amount of hand-holding to ensure you progress through the story. My favorite puzzle would have to be  the part where you record a guard's responses and have to splice/edit a 3-part dialogue in order to get another guard to leave his post.\n\nOverall, the game is a nice, quick experience that will be enjoyed by sci-fi lovers. A good time filler.\n\nRecommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews\n","October 17, 2014","true","7.9"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","17","26","0","0"

It feels a bit rough, with the quality of the art jumping around a lot, as well as the gameplay feeling a bit unbalanced in a large manner, not knowing exactly what elements of classic adventure games it wants to focus on while still maintaining the rigid linearity of the graphic novels it also takes inspiration from. On top of that, the story has several plot holes already that I am not entirely sure you will ever learn more about. If that were not enough, this first episode only lasts approximately 83 minutes, placing it around Telltale episode length while providing a much less engaging experience.

The 50's vibe that's going on is also something I'm very into so of course upon reading the game description I was drawn in. Only after purchasing and finishing the game did I discover the snags in development, however from what the devs are saying the remaining two parts are coming, albeit slowly, these things happen, and frankly, based on the strength of this first part I don't mind waiting. From the sounds of things we should have part 2 soon.\n\nThe art style is painterly and comic-inspired and fits with the rest of the game. The way it ends (I'll keep this vague to stay spoiler-free) is done in such a way that even in the event that the remaining two parts don't get finished it could really just be a very short game that is left open to interpretation, I mean there are films that do that. I wouldn't say that the game feels incomplete without the rest but it does leave you with questions and I'll definitely be eagerly awaiting the remaining parts.\n\nThe soundtrack is also really good, and again fits well with the rest of the game.","January 31","true","1.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

Meanwhile, I've seen about 10 different scenes in a cartoonish style, telling the story in typical bubbles. I've solved two major puzzles (cracking a door lock terminal and setting together a recording with soundclips) that took about five minutes to figure out and accomplish each. There are only a few animations, sometimes the game just feels like looking into a picture book - and that in turn seems rather unlively.\n\nThe soundtrack sounds quite decent to me, but no accents at all. There's no voice acting or material sounds either, and the music gets repititive after half an hour.\n\nSo far, that's a big minus for atmosphere. But what about the story? Maybe it is able to compensate the lack of it, at least a bit?\n\nWell, for me, it does not. You don't learn much about the character you're playing. Circumstances are: You're awakening from cryostasis, world has changed, one big company to rule it all, no more humans but lot of androids populating the city/world. An underground union planing an uprising that you are joining. You want to know who you are. But the way the game tries to keep you motivated, creates tension, introduces characters - it just doesnt work well. The world simply does not seem credible - I think that is the closest word  I can describe it with.\n\nThe game has to improve a lot in my opinion, in all areas - the state the game is in at the moment, I'm not looking forward to playing episodes 2 & 3.","January 31, 2015","false","1.5"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

It’s not really a game but a motion comic visual novel with some interactivity.\n\nThe setting and characters pay homage to the great sci-fi stories of the sixties and seventies. The world is dystopian cyberpunk, sort of a reverse Blade Runner, populated by androids who either imitate humans (elite class) or not (working class). It’s not too original, but quite immersive thanks to the artwork and incredible soundtrack.\n\nThe story is simple as a brick. It uses one of the biggest clichés (amnesiac on the run) and never leaves the comfort zone of teenage fanfiction territory.

Moreover, the dialogue could have been proofread more thoroughly, as I spotted a few missing or incorrect words, but overall the dialogue and texts are very well written.\n\nI don't have the heart to fault the game for these small issues when the overall experience is so pleasant and inspiring. You will like this if you like scifi/cyberpunk stories, beautiful art and atmospheric music. And you can always wait until the final Act is released and it won't feel so short.","March 22","true","2.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Got it from a bundle and was expecting it to be another throwaway title to get some cards from, but wound up finishing the episode and wanting more of it.\n\nThe interesting neo-noir-esque art style and theme got me hooked from the first couple of screens, there were little bits of flavor text throughout each scene, and the puzzles weren't mindbendingly difficult like some point-and-clicks tend to go for. Also, I really liked the characters introduced in this episode (a couple of them have Vignettes at this time that add to the lore and atmosphere of the game) and look forward to future installments.\n\nPretty short game, but considering it's Episode 1 of a future series, I won't hold that against it.","January 11, 2015","true","1.2"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

You play as 905, someone who doesn't know what or who they are, and why you are being hunted down. The game play is simple point and click- but the story really draws you in, giving you little information at a time.\n\nThe graphics are not terrible, but I was expecting more. The game is marketed as a motion comic, but I beg to differ. It's got some of the black frames and dialog boxes but still lacks in a true comic book style feel. It shys away from really reaching that graphic feel that it needs. There needs to be more reference in the direction. What are they going for?  Is it concept art? Is it sketch-y? Is it graphic? Is it rendered? I'm not sure. It's a mishmosh between styles and it looks poor. The only good design choices are the several perspective shots (that are repeated with differnt environents may I add, some variations would be nice), and the color pallette. Even the intimate moments with memorable characters are tossed aside frame panel to panel in quality. I'd expect more of a final design when I'm speaking to a character. It seems that the art style is unresolved and needs refinment for the next two chapters.\n\nTossing art direction aside, this game does a great job with its characters. They're memorable in their own ways and it's interesting to see how they interact with you with various dialouge trees ( I love me some dialogue trees). Each character molds well into the world. Without spoiling any of the storyline, I'm just going to say that I'm very excited to see how the other chapters unfold with them.\n\nOverrall, the gameplay is super catchy. Like I noted before, the story really draws you in without giving you much of a bone when you get more information. Good games work because of interesting storylines and gameplay. Graphics wouldn't make this type of game more fun, but an upgrade would really help to make this game stand on it's own even more.","September 18, 2015","true","1.7"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

There is no ETA for when episode 3  wil be finished, as the dev is only using their spare time to work on the game.\n\nHi guys, I love point and click games and have been playing them for a long time. I also love interactive fiction games, so a story is something I really value in games.\n\nEpisode 1:\n\nOverview\n\nThis game's first episode was a great start, with a very interesting sci-fi premise and a mix of visual novel with very simple point and click elements. It is a text only game (no voice, only music), with visuals that reminded me of comic books, so it was really nice and fits the story pretty well.\n\nGameplay\n\nThere is a lot of text to be read, and most of the game you'll spend talking to people. There are some very simple puzzles to solve, and I only had trouble with the first puzzle in the game because I did not memorize an important piece of information in the first scene, before you can investigate the first room in the game.\n\nControls/Interface\n\nYou only use the mouse, and the interface is very easy to use, no problems at all. Controller support would be great, so I could play on my TV. It would also be great to be able to change the game's font size, as it is very hard to read if you play on a big screen TV. I know playing on a big TV with a controller is not expected for P&C games, but I believe more developers should take people who like to play on couch into consideration.\n\nVeredict\n\nI have played the whole game and the two vignettes that were released (included with the game before the next episode is released), and I must say that the game is really worth your time. This game has been in two bundles already, and is discounted from time to time, so go ahead and buy it if you are into games with a story, and a very interesting one to boot.\n\nEpisode 2:\n\nThis part of the game develops the plot a bit more, and I see some nice improvements in terms of graphics and story development. The whole episode, however, is a lot shorter than the first one, and the only challenge in the game is finding the right people to talk to so you can advance the plot (no real puzzles this time).\n\nVeredict: If you can accept the fact that this game is going to take long to be finished but is a labor of love, you won't be disappointed. This episode is short but I really enjoyed playing it, as the world built by the game is believable and the whole dystopia setting was nicely built.","December 27, 2014","true","3.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

The art, the hyper text, the soundtrack, everything in the right place! The story seems a bit confusing at the beggining but then unravels a little. The first episode is short, it took me aprox. 1h20m to complete. But it left me hyped for the remaining episodes! And the little packs of additional story (minisodes) that the developers are adding now and then (2 available at the moment) are another pro to the buying of The Maker's Eden, which is set in a universe where everyone is a robot but for two individuals. I recommend this treat for everyone! Maybe not for those gamers that don't enjoy (but should) point&click games. Right, forgot about replayability.

This point and click adventure had me hooked from the very beginning. The amazingly beautiful artwork highlighted by the smooth and comforting soundtrack made the story flow with ease. The story itself was amazing and very well written. Maker's Eden puts the character 905 in the same position as you, new to this world and not knowing anything about yourself. The twist is you do know things about the world around you. As the amnesia effect is in full swing you want to look around and find clues to your existance as well as learning about the world around you and how Didymus has come to rule everything around you. As the story progresses each individual character has their own piece of backstory and the ensemble of characters all revolve around eachother and lead back to you. The side storys provide the lore into characters that the story missed.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ferencmato/recommended/313360/","ferencmato","Pickles Giggles","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ferencmato/","275 products in account","NOTE: This review only covers Act 1 and it will be updated after acts 2 and 3 are added into the game.\n\nI'll be honest, I'm not really into point&click adventure games. There always seems to be something that ruins the experience for me - puzzles that don't make any sense, hidden objects, actions that take forever to perform, bad voice acting, etc. It's a good thing then, that I've had none of those problems with TME, although it's by no means perfect.\n\nTME is set in a  retro-futuristic dystopian world, where it never seems to stops raining, and where apparently both flying taxicabs and vinyl LP records are still totally relevant. It screams technoir. Visualy, it's a nice mix of a first person view and a comic book panels as a way of telling a story. Although the artwork quality is somewhat inconsistent in some scenes (especially towards the end of the first act), it's still very atmospheric and enjoyable. That's actually the thing this game is very good at - creating an atmosphere. The aesthetic fits the setting perfectly. The soundtrack is also really good and helps a whole lot in that regard. The combination of electronic music and jazz reminds me of Gunpoint OST (one of my favorite game soundtracks).\n\nObviously, I don't want to talk about the plot that much, so I won't spoil it for others. The little I can tell  you is that the game starts as you wake up in an abandoned building with no memory of who you are. You will need some help to figure out what's going on in the world around you…\nWhile it's not the best writing I've seen in a game, nor is it original, I found myself very invested in the story and I can't wait for the rest.\nWhat I really have to mention are the characters. The writing and the character design work so well together, making every character a unique, memorable personality.  Sadly, there's no voice acting, it's all just hypertext. It could've been so much better, but then again, I'll rather have no voice acting, than a bad one…\nGameplay-wise, there's not much to talk about, really. It's a very casual game, with only a few easy puzzles, just enough to keep you engaged. There are of course dialogues, but from what I can tell, there are no bad answers. That's kind of a weird thing to me - making hypertext, story driven game with totally linear narrative...Sigh. To be fair though, devs claim that it will get more interesting an non-linear in the next act.\n\nAs of now, the game consists of Act 1 and two additional very short stories (related to two of the characters you meet in the first act). It only took me 2 hours to play through, and that comes from someone who likes to take his time, read everything properly and enjoy the scenery. You could definitely run through it in an hour or so.\nThat brings up an important question - is it worth the price? At this point, I'm not so sure. These season-pass-kind-of-deals are always risky. Considering how short the story is, Act 2 release is long overdue, which is not helping the situation. At least devs still seem to be working on it instead of just dropping the ball, so that's good to know.\nRight now, I would either recommend you to get it in a bundle (like I did) or a sale, or maybe just wait a bit.\n\nConclusion\n\nIf you like cyberpunk/technoir genre and visual novels, and you don't mind reading, there's a good chance that you'll enjoy the short TME experience - as long as you'll treat it as a visual novel, not the game. It's not very original, but still  atmospheric and intriguing. I'm definitely looking forward to see more of that world and hear more of that great soundtrack. Again, bear in mind that this isn't a complete game, and that the full price may not be adequatte at this moment (as I mentioned in a previous paragraph).\nIf nothing else, it made me watch Blade Runner yet once again, so that's a plus I guess…","May 18, 2015","true","2.2"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","16","24","3","8"

At the time of writing this review, there have been two extra vignettes released, both of which are meant to be extremely quick, supplemental material. They each take around five minutes to complete. Be advised, the game is a three-part series, and I assume that owners of the game will receive the other 2 segments when they are released.\n\nIf you like graphic novels, sci-fi dystopian themes, and super casual gameplay, then you will enjoy this game.\n\nThe aesthetics are very good - the detail in the environment and art style are both well-done. The music is also good, and adds to the atmosphere of the game. The story is pretty interesting, although it is nothing elaborate or intricate (granted, I have read A LOT of fantasy and sci-fi). I look forward to trying out the next instalments.\n\nAs a point-and-clicker, the game runs mostly like a graphic novel, with some dialogue options and very simple puzzles. That being said, the controls are super easy to understand. The learning curve is minimal, however, there is one "main" puzzle that took me a few minutes to figure out.  I had thought that the keypad grid required you to connect EVERY letter to its corresponding number (ex: A -> 1, B -> 2, etc), which is absolutely impossible.\n\nDuring gameplay, most of the "puzzles" can be solved intuitively, and the game provides a fair amount of hand-holding to ensure you progress through the story. My favorite puzzle would have to be  the part where you record a guard's responses and have to splice/edit a 3-part dialogue in order to get another guard to leave his post.\n\nOverall, the game is a nice, quick experience that will be enjoyed by sci-fi lovers. A good time filler.\n\nRecommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews\n","October 17, 2014","true","7.9"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","17","26","0","0"

The 50's vibe that's going on is also something I'm very into so of course upon reading the game description I was drawn in.

From the sounds of things we should have part 2 soon.\n\nThe art style is painterly and comic-inspired and fits with the rest of the game. The way it ends (I'll keep this vague to stay spoiler-free) is done in such a way that even in the event that the remaining two parts don't get finished it could really just be a very short game that is left open to interpretation, I mean there are films that do that.

Meanwhile, I've seen about 10 different scenes in a cartoonish style, telling the story in typical bubbles. I've solved two major puzzles (cracking a door lock terminal and setting together a recording with soundclips) that took about five minutes to figure out and accomplish each. There are only a few animations, sometimes the game just feels like looking into a picture book - and that in turn seems rather unlively.\n\nThe soundtrack sounds quite decent to me, but no accents at all. There's no voice acting or material sounds either, and the music gets repititive after half an hour.\n\nSo far, that's a big minus for atmosphere. But what about the story? Maybe it is able to compensate the lack of it, at least a bit?\n\nWell, for me, it does not. You don't learn much about the character you're playing. Circumstances are: You're awakening from cryostasis, world has changed, one big company to rule it all, no more humans but lot of androids populating the city/world. An underground union planing an uprising that you are joining. You want to know who you are. But the way the game tries to keep you motivated, creates tension, introduces characters - it just doesnt work well.

It’s not really a game but a motion comic visual novel with some interactivity.\n\nThe setting and characters pay homage to the great sci-fi stories of the sixties and seventies. The world is dystopian cyberpunk, sort of a reverse Blade Runner, populated by androids who either imitate humans (elite class) or not (working class). It’s not too original, but quite immersive thanks to the artwork and incredible soundtrack.\n\nThe story is simple as a brick. It uses one of the biggest clichés (amnesiac on the run) and never leaves the comfort zone of teenage fanfiction territory. Every line is a clumsy exposition dump or some stumbling dialogue.\n\nThe world has lots of work behind it and has great potential, but so far the only worthwhile part is the visual presentation; it really needs to pick up pace for the next act.","July 21, 2015","true","1.1"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","0"

It took me only 2 hours to play Acts 1 and 2, but it's definitely worth the price and I plan to play it again when the third act finally comes (probably a year from now). You will take longer if you stop to admire the art in more detail, soak in the atmosphere and listen to the music. The puzzles are not terribly challenging, so that cuts the play time short as well.\n\nThere are a few minor technical issues: if you exit to Windows for whatever reason, the music may stop playing and it won't restart until you restart the game. Occasionally text is cut and only partially visible but you can still make out what it is supposed to read. In the bar scene, you have a conversation option available when it shouldn't yet be, but you can guess that you shouldn't pick that one yet and it won't ruin anything. Moreover, the dialogue could have been proofread more thoroughly, as I spotted a few missing or incorrect words, but overall the dialogue and texts are very well written.\n\nI don't have the heart to fault the game for these small issues when the overall experience is so pleasant and inspiring. You will like this if you like scifi/cyberpunk stories, beautiful art and atmospheric music.

You play as 905, someone who doesn't know what or who they are, and why you are being hunted down. The game play is simple point and click- but the story really draws you in, giving you little information at a time.\n\nThe graphics are not terrible, but I was expecting more. The game is marketed as a motion comic, but I beg to differ. It's got some of the black frames and dialog boxes but still lacks in a true comic book style feel. It shys away from really reaching that graphic feel that it needs. There needs to be more reference in the direction. What are they going for?  Is it concept art? Is it sketch-y? Is it graphic? Is it rendered? I'm not sure. It's a mishmosh between styles and it looks poor. The only good design choices are the several perspective shots (that are repeated with differnt environents may I add, some variations would be nice), and the color pallette. Even the intimate moments with memorable characters are tossed aside frame panel to panel in quality. I'd expect more of a final design when I'm speaking to a character. It seems that the art style is unresolved and needs refinment for the next two chapters.\n\nTossing art direction aside, this game does a great job with its characters. They're memorable in their own ways and it's interesting to see how they interact with you with various dialouge trees ( I love me some dialogue trees). Each character molds well into the world. Without spoiling any of the storyline, I'm just going to say that I'm very excited to see how the other chapters unfold with them.\n\nOverrall, the gameplay is super catchy. Like I noted before, the story really draws you in without giving you much of a bone when you get more information. Good games work because of interesting storylines and gameplay. Graphics wouldn't make this type of game more fun, but an upgrade would really help to make this game stand on it's own even more.","September 18, 2015","true","1.7"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

There is no ETA for when episode 3  wil be finished, as the dev is only using their spare time to work on the game.\n\nHi guys, I love point and click games and have been playing them for a long time. I also love interactive fiction games, so a story is something I really value in games.\n\nEpisode 1:\n\nOverview\n\nThis game's first episode was a great start, with a very interesting sci-fi premise and a mix of visual novel with very simple point and click elements. It is a text only game (no voice, only music), with visuals that reminded me of comic books, so it was really nice and fits the story pretty well.\n\nGameplay\n\nThere is a lot of text to be read, and most of the game you'll spend talking to people. There are some very simple puzzles to solve, and I only had trouble with the first puzzle in the game because I did not memorize an important piece of information in the first scene, before you can investigate the first room in the game.\n\nControls/Interface\n\nYou only use the mouse, and the interface is very easy to use, no problems at all. Controller support would be great, so I could play on my TV. It would also be great to be able to change the game's font size, as it is very hard to read if you play on a big screen TV. I know playing on a big TV with a controller is not expected for P&C games, but I believe more developers should take people who like to play on couch into consideration.\n\nVeredict\n\nI have played the whole game and the two vignettes that were released (included with the game before the next episode is released), and I must say that the game is really worth your time. This game has been in two bundles already, and is discounted from time to time, so go ahead and buy it if you are into games with a story, and a very interesting one to boot.\n\nEpisode 2:\n\nThis part of the game develops the plot a bit more, and I see some nice improvements in terms of graphics and story development. The whole episode, however, is a lot shorter than the first one, and the only challenge in the game is finding the right people to talk to so you can advance the plot (no real puzzles this time).\n\nVeredict: If you can accept the fact that this game is going to take long to be finished but is a labor of love, you won't be disappointed. This episode is short but I really enjoyed playing it, as the world built by the game is believable and the whole dystopia setting was nicely built.","December 27, 2014","true","3.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

The art, the hyper text, the soundtrack, everything in the right place! The story seems a bit confusing at the beggining but then unravels a little.

And the little packs of additional story (minisodes) that the developers are adding now and then (2 available at the moment) are another pro to the buying of The Maker's Eden, which is set in a universe where everyone is a robot but for two individuals. I recommend this treat for everyone! Maybe not for those gamers that don't enjoy (but should) point&click games. Right, forgot about replayability.

I figured that by the time Act 2 came, there would be enough content to really justify the purchase of the game. That being said Act 2 seemed to be even better and worse for me because I found the writing and flow of the game to be nicer, but it was even shorter than the act before it. A game that was quality over quantity became even more lopsidedly so. While I still recommend this game, I really don't expect it to be a long game, and I don't expect it to be finished any time soon. I really like the game, but it's hard to recommend when it will likely take another year or so to finish.","March 25","true","2.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

This point and click adventure had me hooked from the very beginning. The amazingly beautiful artwork highlighted by the smooth and comforting soundtrack made the story flow with ease. The story itself was amazing and very well written. Maker's Eden puts the character 905 in the same position as you, new to this world and not knowing anything about yourself. The twist is you do know things about the world around you. As the amnesia effect is in full swing you want to look around and find clues to your existance as well as learning about the world around you and how Didymus has come to rule everything around you. As the story progresses each individual character has their own piece of backstory and the ensemble of characters all revolve around eachother and lead back to you. The side storys provide the lore into characters that the story missed. Overall I found myself absolutely loving this game and I can't wait to see what is next.\n\nRATING:\n\nArt: 10/10\n\nStory: 10/10\n\nMechanics: 6/10\n\nGameplay: 8/10\n\nBang for your Buck: 7/10\n\nOVERALL RATING: 82/100","April 26, 2015","true","1.1"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"
