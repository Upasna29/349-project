I spent a lot of time as a young kid playing Arkanoid with my family. My mother and I spent hours upon hours playing it, had the actual Arkanoid controller and everything. So this type of game is a classic to me. An all time favorite. Before i played this, Reaxxion was the best block breaker game that i had ever played, but it doesent even come close to being able to compare to Shatter. Shatte3r is in a class by itself.\nYou can control the ball once you get it down pat, you have the ability to push or pull the ball by using either the left or right mouse buttons. So as its bouncing aorund you can kind of direct it to where you want it to go. At first it seemed random to me. But after a few minutes oif play i caught on, and i was guiding the ball straight to the blocks i wanted it to hit, instead of just bouncing it off of my paddle and hoping it hit something like every other block breaker game in existence.\nThe graphics are really nice, the music fits well and is upbeat, gets you hyped up while playing. The controls are nice and tight, no movements you dont expect or anything of the sort. It also has boss battles. I've only odne 1 so far, and it was pretty interesting. Was battling a big snake-like thing that had a paddle on its head, hitting the ball back at me, and i needed to keep hitting its body to defeat it. After that, there was a bonus level where i had ot keep 3 balls in play at once, there were no blocks ont he screen, just the balls, but the gravity was random and made the balls fly all goofy, and got faster and faster as you went on.\n\nIf you're into block breaker games, you are definitely going to want this one. There i sno comparing it to any other, at least not that ive hand my hands on.\n\nFor the genre this game is in, on a scale of 1 throguh 10, its an easy 10/10.","January 4, 2014","true","0.3"," 23 of 29 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","23","29","0","3"

Suck in power ups, blow out fragments and manuever your ship through some beautiful environments and challenging bosses.  I figured this would be a quick one off 10-minute pick-up game, but the "one more round" leveling and mastering the physics just sucks you in...  It's fast, fun and challenging to figure out when to suck and when to blow to best position your ball for maximum fragmentation.\n\nRecommended for arcade puzzle and shooter fans alike; Shatter is good for a quick blast, or an OCD high score mission.  Plus Multiplayer hot seat or co-op and XBOX 360 controller support...I picked this Steam Key on sale at Amazon for 2.49.  That didn't suck either...

Physics was always going to be a natural evolution for the genre. Unlike its forerunners, the quality in Shatter is not from quantity, but clarity. There is physics: bricks swing, bounce and slide about, but it's not the centrepiece. It's developers remembered correctly, that in games like these, the star is the paddle.\n\nLeft and right triggers push and pull with understandable conviction, letting you curve the ball slightly for ninja-class aimed shots. Bricks shatter into Shards, collected with pull to charge a manually-activated super-shot barrage that blasts through bricks in slow-motion. The charge meter also powers your shield, used to protect yourself from incoming bricks. If a brick hits the paddle, it's out of commission for a few vital seconds. Trusty multi-ball is available at any time, if you want to risk your ball stock on it. Press X, and one of your lives enters the playfield in simple risk versus reward.\n\nLong after you're done playing, the modernized chiptune retrostyled music will remain in your head, by far the most memorable aspect of the game. That, and how cheap it is.\n\nAfter 23 years, there is finally something better than Arkanoid. It tells an engrossing story of an errant kinetic harvesting machine gone rogue. The plot is presented in pantomime. The paddle, your avatar in its two-dimensional world of balls and bricks, is a Jedi.","September 22, 2014","true","3.0"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

I remember a Breakout clone on the BBC Micro that my headmaster was showing off, It was an old-♥♥♥ game getting cloned by the time I was in primary school. I don't 'remember' Breakout, although I played a bit of Arkanoid and Batty on the Spectrum.\n\nThis is a cool Breakout style game. It has slightly more interesting mechanics, in that you can multiball whenever you want, and the triggers can blow and suck your balls (Please. We've established that I'm old as hell but come on, I'm better than that). It has all the cool powerups and variety in block type and arena layout to keep you interested.\n\nHow about Wipeout? Do you remembe Wipeout?\n\nI ask because that's the other main influence that really jumped out at me from this game. I *do* remember Wipeout. I remember it being a busy time for videogaming, with the Playstation happening and Designers Republic taking gaming into clubland and bringing back with some of the spoils. I remember Wipeout as being representative of that really vibrant and exciting time.\n\nAnd that's the other thing about Shatter. it's really... exciting. That's honestly the best word for it. It feels like something that should've been in the arcade. It's got that magical impact that reeks of the arcade, when they were trying to give you your money's worth in satisfying noises as soon as you hit the Start button. It's loud and bright and exciting and cool and does feel a bit like you're playing a visualiser at times.\n\nArkanoid + Wipeout with a bit of Peggle.

Well this game is like Arkanoid but with X, Y, Z, A, B, C, D and J.  A very inventive spin on the genre.  How inventive?  How about boss battles that require different strategies to beat.  Or bricks that are cells and multiply via mitosis.  Or bricks that take off like bottle rockets when you hit them.  Or....\n\nMUSIC:\nThe creators of this game were clearly fans of Daft Punk.  The soundtrack is =SUPERB=.  This is the Daft Punkiest game soundtrack that doesn't actually have music by Daft Punk.  And I mean that in the best way.\n\nGRAPHICS:\nThe graphics presentation is very polished.  Stylized 3D backgrounds compliment the 2D gameplay action in the foreground.  Between each round the camera moves around or through the 3D background for another viewpoint.  The only drawback here is sometimes the ball is difficult to see when the bloomy particle effects are at their most concentrated.\n\nIf you like old-school breakout action with a modern shine and everything but the kitchen sink added to it, get this game!\n\nDisclaimer; I am only a couple of hours into the game at this point.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yukichigai/recommended/20820/","yukichigai","Y|yukichigai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yukichigai/","463 products in account","Shatter is about bouncing a projectile between your paddle/ship/etc. and various blocks you need to break to progress to the next stage.  Power-ups occasionally drop from said blocks, and there are different varieties.  That's all pretty basic.  What sets Shatter apart is the beautiful backgrounds and setpieces in the game, as well as the unique features it adds.  The most obvious is your ability to push away or draw in objects as you play, including the ball, the pickups, the fragments (points), and sometimes the blocks themselves.  At first it's merely a nice feature for adjusting the path of the ball mid-flight, but later it becomes necessary to really properly progress through the game.  Fortunately, Shatter does a good job of ramping up the necessity of using these features, so by the time you truly need to it's natural.\n\nAnother somewhat unusual feature is the concept of boss fights, not totally unseen in a block-breaker clone but rarely done well.  Shatter does it quite well, I'm happy to say, and thanks to the aforementioned beautiful design of the game the bosses are visually satisfying in addition to challenging.  The mechanics of each boss fight are similar but not identical, making you target specific vulnerable points while dodging whatever attacks the boss is capable of.  The fights are also spaced evenly between the levels, giving you a nice change of pace to break up any monotony that might set in.\n\nDifficulty wise, the game is not easy but not especially hard for an experienced player... at least when it comes to just surviving the game.  If you want to rack up the high scores, well that will take some serious skill.  The game's scoring system is simple on paper but hard to master, relying on a multiplier which increases with gathered fragments but decreases for any blocks which slip past your paddle or make contact with it (yes, they can do that).  It provides a reason to replay the game for people who are all about the high scores, made even more attractive with the game virtually taunting you by showing you higher scores from any of your friends who also play the game.  Devious, but effective.\n\nBeyond all that the game is quite solid, featuring some unique types of blocks, interesting mechanics, varied arena shapes including circular, and a fun bonus round after each area where you have to keep three projectiles in the arena for as long as possible.  I also really have to compliment the game's music, which is both fitting and kind of catchy.  If you have any love for Kavinsky or Daft Punk you'll probably like the soundtrack.\n\nShatter is a fresh take on an old formula, one that adds some interesting new concepts without straying too far from the basic idea.  It hits that perfect line of "easy to pick up yet difficult to master", and provides something you can either spend hours on or just pick up for a few minutes at a time.","June 7, 2014","true","3.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Also boss levels where you fight against big bosses.\nYou have special skills like blowing or shooting. You can also transform your ball into other types with special drops.\nThere are many block types with special skills that you have to destroy like bombs.\nAlso the game has physics! Great physics. I really like it.\n\nI have a lot of fun playing this game. It has a nice futuristic drawing style.\nFurthermore it has a coop mode for you and your friends.\nThe best about this game is probably the soundtrack.\nIts produced by someone named Module.\nA really good electro soundtrack with a lot of different styles.\n\nIf you are a brick breaker gamer or simply wanna try retro games again, this is the first you should play!\nDefinitely worth being played!\n9/10","December 3, 2014","true","3.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/20820/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Shatter is a game in where you control a paddle and try to break all the blocks on the screen. A simple task that gets progressively harder the further in you go. Starting off most of the modes are locked so your only real option is Story Mode. It starts off with your tiny robot paddle breaking out of confinement and going off to shatter the cells containing your brethren, as well as taking down the giant robotic wardens guarding each world. After that there are no more cutscenes until the very end and it’s pure gameplay. Your paddle also has the ability to suck or blow air to interact with objects or to alter the course of your ball. It can be used to collect the shards that break off of blocks for a large amount of points but you also have the risk of drawing a block in a crash course towards you. Getting hit by an object will take you out of the action for a few seconds which may prove deadly if the ball comes your way and you are unable to bounce it back.\n\nBalls are basically your lives and losing all of them means you start at the start of the board and lose all of your points. It is not a hard game however, it seems very intent on keeping you alive as when you are down to a single life they will sure as rain throw a 1Up power up to keep you going. You really have to go out of your way to get yourself killed in Story mode so it feels focused more on the fun and the score instead of having any real challenge. In addition to the 1Up power up there is one that makes your ball into an unstoppable force that can break through any bricks and one that makes the ball smaller but allows you to easier control it by manipulating the wind. The blue shards that appear when bricks break serve another purpose other than just being there for points. Once you collect enough of them you can activate an attack that causes your paddle to fire a ton of projectiles wherever you aim and is very useful for damaging bosses. Blocks themselves can also be a danger to you if you just break without strategy in the later levels. They have their own physics and some can become unhinged from the cluster and come falling toward you. You could simply dodge them most of the time but you will be losing out on points if you are trying to compete with your friends.\n\nSometimes your paddle will be on the left side of the screen or on the bottom depending on the level. Some levels are even spherical and the variation in them really helps keeping the game from getting stale. That was a very real danger as the story mode is quite long and will take multiple hours to get through, though it managed to be just as fun at the end without feeling drawn out. Each world has a different background but none are really interesting. What truly separates them from one another is the boss at the end of each one and the ways in how to take them down. All bosses are unique and have different weakness that you must find in order to take them down. They are pretty fun to fight though the battles do suffer a bit from the amount of damage they can take making it feel like a test of endurance over skillful shooting. A lot of creativity went into these bosses and do not feel like a gimmick. These fights are likely where you will lose most of your lives so it comes in handy to have your shard meter filled in case you may need it. They are the only enemies in the game and the majority of the time you will be breaking blocks. In between levels there is a bonus mode where you try to keep three balls in play all at once in order to gain some extra points. This is a rather variation that can be played all you want once you unlock Bonus Mode after beating the game.\n\nGraphics do their job, nothing impressive but it is very colorful. The highest resolution it goes up to is 1080p unfortunately. You can set the game to a higher resolution by tweaking a file but it is still something worth mentioning. Another problem is that you can't rebind keys and the button to shoot shards is “crtl” which can be troublesome to reach when you are playing with the mouse. One gameplay annoyance I have is that you can't choose when your ball will be shot from the paddle so you have to either rush for an opening or hope it shoots while you still have a good shot. And those are pretty much the only flaws I could see in this game. The frames will be as high as your monitor will allow them to be making the game feel even more smooth and responsive for those with monitors over 60hz. Music is pretty catchy and definitely a soundtrack worthy of a purchase. There is no voices or text, just one small cut-scene during the end and beginning then it is all arcade action without interruption.\n\nFrom start to finish you will be doing the same thing which is breaking blocks, though they somehow managed to create a lot of content out of that simple concept. In addition to the lengthy story mode you have a couple of other modes to choose from. These include Endless which has you trying to survive in progressively harder waves of blocks and Endless coop that adds another local player to the mix. The second player controls his paddle with the “wasd” control scheme and the first can use either the mouse or arrow keys. You also have a Time Attack mode that has you rack up as much points as possible in five minutes and the previously mentioned Bonus mode where you try to keep three balls in the air for as long as you can. Boss rush mode is easily the worst one as fighting the damage spongy bosses wasn't that fun to begin with. All in all there is quite a bit to keep you entertained if you are into the brick breaking genre. It has a few flaws like non rebindable keys and the bosses that take too long to go down but other than that it is great. Great music, great gameplay and lots of content makes this a solid buy for anyone looking to buy a fun and simple to pick up game.","December 20, 2015","true","4.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/serendone/recommended/20820/","serendone","Serendone","http://steamcommunity.com/id/serendone/","675 products in account","An experience that can best be described as "Breakout on acid", Shatter combines the familiar bat-and-ball destruction with some welcome twists, beautiful graphics, and an addictive and unobnoxious soundtrack. You control a bat and hit a ball against all manner of blocks, breaking them so you can suck up their powers. This game adds a suction power and a pulse power that respectively push and pull the ball, allowing you greater control and a unique way to approach the original formula.\n\nAmong the wide array of blocks you break are explosives, blocks that exert force, blocks that attach or free-float, blocks that generate shields, and others in all kinds of unique formations. In addition, you've also got levels with different orientation, from your classic up and down, to left and right, or even circular. Add to all of this a challenging boss encounter at the end of each world and you've got a game chock full of twists and turns.\n\nWith this in mind, another way Shatter could be described is "Not your momma's breakout!" Breakout is intense in its own right, but for the most part the original formula is rather slow and homogenous. This game is not for the casual. It will challenge you, and you will have to think strategically as well as on your feet.\n\nThat's not to say this game is Super Hexagon-level hard. You walk a thick line between frustration and challenge, and the game throws lives at you the moment you hit under 3. It's not a difficult game if you've got the coordination, and there's no real punishment for losing all your lives other than restarting the current level.\n\nAll in all, Shatter puts a fresh new spin on an old game, managing to feel unique in its own right. It's not for the casual gamer, but if you want a simple game with eye-popping visuals and lots and lots of chaos on-screen, Shatter is a good purchase.","March 9, 2014","true","2.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Shatter blends a classic genre with some interesting physics and dynamic control to create what is at once an homage to a key part of gaming history as well as an original and impressive game in its own right.\n\nIn addition to a just-the-right-length campaign mode, there are a slew of additional modes and same-machine co-op, which should let anybody easily sink tens if not hundreds of hours into Shatter.\n\nIn terms of downsides, the lack of networked multiplayer means the co-op mode will likely get limited use (understandably, the game would be a nightmare to sync across the internet). Beyond that, I can't really find anything to complain about in Shatter.\n\nOh, and the soundtrack is very awesome too.","July 3, 2011","true","12.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Whether you keep it old school and rely solely on your skills of maneuvering the "bat" and hitting the ball at the right angle or if you use the new "Suck" & "Blow" gameplay mechanics to help guide the ball where you need it to be, this easy to play yet challenging to master game will give you hours upon hours of enjoyment. And don't forget the "Shard Storm" should you need help taking out some bricks or just want to eliminate the bosses faster.\n\nBut wait, there's more! Should you get bored with Story Mode, there's additional modes to play, even more than what the PS3 version of the game has. Boss Rush has you facing off against Story Mode's bosses, one right after the other, keeping track of your time. Bonus Mode consists of 3 stages where, with three balls out at the start and each gaining speed after every hit, you go thru each stage aiming to achieve the highest score you can. Time Attack & Time Attack Co-op has you racing against the clock as you try to increase your score as quickly as possible. And there's even an Endless Mode (Co-op available too) if you can handle staring at your monitor and losing track of time for hours on end.\n\nHighly recommended, and I'd like to suggest the soundtrack as well.

That is saying a LOT for this little gem!\n\nMy review for this game breaks down as follows:\n\nValue (worth 40 points):\nThis game offers a TON of value with super addictive gameplay that will have you wanting to play again and again.  With all the different modes of play you will unlock and the fact that no two games will ever be the same, I give this game a 38 out of 40 for value for your money (even at the full $9.99 USD price)\n\nFun (worth 30 points):\nThis game also delivers in this facet of my game grading criteria.  It's simply a helluva lot of fun to play, period.  I give this game a 28 out of 30 possible points here.\n\nControls & Bugs (worth 20 points)\nNo bugs at all that I've found, and the controls are amazing.. perfect to be completely honest.  I prefer playing Shatter with a mouse and keyboard, but you can play with a controller too!  Everything can be configured to your personal preference! (From your Steam library, right click on Shatter and choose the Shatter settings editor to change any setting at any time)  20 out of 20 possible points for Shatter in this aspect of the game!\n\nGraphics & Sound (worth 10 points)\nThe music and sound in Shatter is beyond amazing, and the colorful and vivid graphics are also super attractive! Could the graphics be a little better?  Sure.. I think so!  If they had only added shadows to the ball and bricks or somehow gave them a sense of 3D depth, they graphics could have been even more beautiful then they are!  So I'll knock this score just a little and give Shatter an 8 out of 10 here.\n\nAdd it all up, and Shatter scores a super impressive 94% in my books, the HIGHEST SCORE of all of my Steam reviews at this point, and I've reviewed about 80 Steam games at this point!  That is a very impressive score to say the least!\n\nMy overall opinion:\nIf you haven't yet experienced Shatter, shut-up and give up the money right now!  Don't wait for a sale!  Don't think about it!  ..Every minute you wait could be a minute of super addictive, fast paced, blissfully fun gaming you could be having!  ..Any gamer won't regret buying this truly awesome game, the only problem might be having to let other family members and friends get their turn when they see you playing this eye catching masterpiece!  Just do it!  A MUST BUY!\n","May 17, 2015","true","2.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

Full controller support is nice although the key board and mouse is perferrable for me. The paddle oriantation changes upon levels which is a little awkward at first.

It's not a terrible game but definitely suffers from a few poor design choices and misfires that could've made it great. The blow and suck mechanic are interesting but quickly fade out due to how weak they actually are. The bosses were an interesting choice but the bullet hell seems to be added to workaround the actual brick breaking gameplay itself, adding a seperate shooting mechanic which by itself isn't fully realized and just turns into "charge this to shoot X", which is kind of boring after doing it so many times. Despite the great visuals and music, it doesn't hold up as well on it's own, even with it's few gimmicks and suffers from many of the classic problems which breakout games have suffered with for years (and a few have actually solved). Overall for me in my own personal opinion it's just steam sale material but nothing too amazing.","March 12","false","0.4"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Also because it was a great game and breaking those little bricks with the ball was addicting and being able to hit just the right angle made you feel skilled.\n\nThen, a few laters, I was a bit bigger fatkid and I played a lot of hours of Alleyway on the Gameboy.  Alleyway was breakout, played the same, was just addictive, felt just as good to make those little block dissapear.  My mom and I played that for years passing it back and forth.\n\nNow, here's Shatter.  This thing's the natural evolution of Breakout and Alleyway, and I see me spending a boat load of hours playing it too.  Except now, it's CRAZY! You can manipulate your balls (HURRRR!) and there's stuff flying at you, and there's mechanics, and it's just all around awesome.\n\nIt really brings back fond memories of the old days, except this one I'm not going to share with my mom cause it's too complicated and she'll call me all the time asking 'what do I do with the blowing thing' and 'why doesn't explode when I hit that one' and 'why are these things flying at me!' and I already get enough phone calls from her on how to check her email.  Don't feel bad though, she's addicted to Candy Crush, that's good enough for her.\n","July 14, 2013","true","7.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I've always loved Arkanoid-style games, but thought they were slightly too boring. This game takes the best of the classic brick-breakers, and makes it more intense with the addition of attractive/repellant forces. It adds quite a bit of strategy. Should you push the balls and point chips away, risking letting the point chips expire, or should you suck them in, pulling the balls back towards you as well? Add to that the addictive techno soundtrack, and this is a game I would have gladly paid double price for.","December 27, 2011","true","7.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

But while remaining faithful with the gameplay, Shatter adds in a new twists in the forms of power ups, special bricks (such as bombs and vortex), boss battles, and some special abilities for the paddle as well. Not only is Shatter fun to play but it also boasts pleasant 3D graphics, an energetic soundtrack and fluid gameplay. Boss battles, while they may seem corny in such a game, manage to break up the monotony of the core gamplay with a pleasant twist of the gameplay. Each boss is equipped with a "weak spot" which must either be opened by the player, or by the boss (usually to use a weapon) which then must be hit by the ball to deal damage.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ulty4life/recommended/20820/","ulty4life","ulty4life","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ulty4life/","108 products in account","An excellent breakout game.\n\nShatter is an upgrade to the classic Breakout and has similar graphics and music treatments to that of the new Pac-Man releases. Much like the addictive gameplay of those classic arcade games, Shatter maintains simple base mechanics, but the twists and upgrades thrown in don't detract from the game at all. In fact, they enhance it and do a good job of keeping the modern video gamer involved in the game when fancier titles sit next to this one in the library.\n\nSome of the "twists" that keep the game from getting too repetitive are the level orientation changes where your paddle might be on the left or on the bottom of the screen; level shape that can change from square or rectangular to circular so that the ball trajectory patterns and paddle path are different and almost become like playing Tempest; various ball upgrades that change the way you play through a level; "push" and "pull" aspects which not only help gather good fragments and repell bad fragments, but also affect ball trajectory; and boss fights. Yes, boss fights. I wasn't sure what to expect from those, but they're extremely well done. The good fragments that you collect can be converted into a rapid-fire barrage of projectiles to help exterminate bosses.\n\nI also found the bonus levels to be quite fun - trying to keep 3 balls alive which are constantly accelerating and appear to be on parabolic orbital paths, all while an extremely dynamic trippy light show plays in the background for your entertainment and distraction.\n\nThe control layout can be a bit wonky depending on the layout of your keyboard, but it's not too big of a deal.\n\nThis game is massively fun.","January 2, 2015","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its like a classic breakthrough with some revolutionary things. The idea is like breakthrough but you use wind to push/pull the ball around and hit angles. So now that blasted last piece is not so hard to get. Be carfull for objects that come at you, while they do not affect your score if you get hit, it takes time away for you to retrieve the ball. The added bosses are interesting because you are having to hit specific spots or hit areas to open the spot you need to defeat him. Once you have enough "power" you can either use it to sheild yourself from objects that get too close, or if it is full you can fire destroying blocks you cant hit easy or on bosses. 9.2/10 :D\nOnly negative thing is sometimes controling the ball does not go where you would think it would, but this is a VERY slight problem and does not ruin the exp of this game :)","December 13, 2010","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, the keyboard controls on the PC are NOT the best and I would recommend  using the mouse to control, and if you do have this on a console also, I would highly recommend the gamepad. The multiplayer is also really fun, but there is also a ton of other modes to try as well. As for the replay value, I really don't know. The story is as follows: you are a ping pong thingy, made only to bounce a ball, then you escape, and try to give the others freedom. So, as you can tell this game doesn't really have a story, but with or without one, I had one heck of a time actually PLAYING shatter. If you liked breakout or simalar games to it, I would totally recommend this, but if you pass on those games, you may want to skip this. Overall, this game is a blast to play, with the execption of odd keyboard controls, 9 out of 10.","April 12, 2014","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can control the ball to some extent by pressing and holding left/right mouse button for pulling/pushing the ball to/from your board, which make the game course more controllable and less frustrating, especially in the case where only a few bricks left on the screen that are extremely hard to hit.\n2. You can collect the energy awarded after hitting bricks and then using them to your advantages by triggering a bullet time or by protecting your board against falling bricks, and sometimes these abilities are essential for winning certain levels.\n3. The bricks are of various types, such as stationary bricks, freely movable bricks, partially fixed bricks, and bricks that fix or moves the other adjacent bricks, and they moves on a physical and dynamic basis.\n4. There is also a boss fight at the end of each stage. Each time you face a different boss with a very unique moving pattern and vulnerability.\nApart from these creative points, the level design is also excellent: the time and difficulty for each of the levels are managable and never reach the threshold for being annoying or tendious, making you always want "one more turn".\nThe visual and sound effects are good, both in terms of aesthetics and game-playing.\nThis game is a must for anyone who likes this genre of games, even at the original price.  For other players, trying Shatter when it is in discount would not disappoint you.","August 29, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

One of the fundamental alterations to the classic Breakout formula here is having an enhanced influence on the ball's trajectory by means of drawing in and expelling air; abilities that can also be used to scoop up valuable objects and in some cases are mandatory or otherwise handy to use in order to defeat bosses. This is a concept that will probably be welcomed by the majority of players but possibly disliked by some purist veterans.\n\nAnother ability that changes things up is a stream of bullets that initially requires charging up and is then unleashed on request in one go to wipe out blocks with ease, helping to prevent the pace of the action and your progress from turning stale. These bullets can also be used to inflict damage upon bosses in addition to striking them at their vulnerable spots with the ball. Another way to expedite the rate of your block-breaking, as well as heighten the challenge is to release multiple balls into concurrent play, thereby giving yourself more things to keep track of and juggle.\n\nWhile the visuals and sound effects are fantastic, the soundtrack is arguably in a league of its own, consisting of talently crafted melodies with intriguing and imaginative synthesis that warrant the price of this title even if there were no gameplay content. All in all, a fantastic and energetic package for a modest price.","February 21, 2013","true","16.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its like a classic breakthrough with some revolutionary things. The idea is like breakthrough but you use wind to push/pull the ball around and hit angles. So now that blasted last piece is not so hard to get. Be carfull for objects that come at you, while they do not affect your score if you get hit, it takes time away for you to retrieve the ball. The added bosses are interesting because you are having to hit specific spots or hit areas to open the spot you need to defeat him. Once you have enough "power" you can either use it to sheild yourself from objects that get too close, or if it is full you can fire destroying blocks you cant hit easy or on bosses. 9.2/10 :D\nOnly negative thing is sometimes controling the ball does not go where you would think it would, but this is a VERY slight problem and does not ruin the exp of this game :)","December 13, 2010","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Most notably it actually gives you some control over the ball when it's in the air, which really eliminates a LOT of the frustration of endlessly trying to get that one last damn brick in the level.\n\nThe control is by sucking and blowing air from your paddle; you also have to contend with picking up the tons of little bonus items each brick releases, which are even more affected by the air motion. So there's a really interesting thing going on here with pushing a bunch of stuff away from you until you can get the ball stuck behind a bunch of bricks, then ssssuuuuuuucking in all those tasty bonus items, and hopefully getting enough of them to charge up your megablaster that can clear out a significant chunk of the level. Or at least enough to throw some more balls out into the arena. I really like being able to summon multiball any time I like!\n\nAlso lots of variety in the levels, some interesting Special Bricks, and the occasional boss. Because EVERY game is made better by bosses, damnit.\n\nI dunno how you'll feel about this if you're a hardcore wall-breaker who lives and dies by finessing the trajectory of their balls. I'm not one of those people. I like flying tiny spaceships through swirling curtains of pink bullets. And this is the first ball-bouncer I may have actually enjoyed playing for every minute of game time in my entire life.","June 30, 2014","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It plays on the old Breakout/Arkanoid trope.  In terms of gameplay it doesn't add a heck of a lot.  There's a 'ball', it bounces, you're a paddle.  Don't let the ball go behind you.. Rien ne change pas. The only difference is that you can affect the balls path using repulsion or attraction.\n\nAlthough the gameplay is very 80s, the graphics and music certainly aren't.  There's even some physics modelling in here for levels where blocks form chains, or 'balls' and roll at you, bouncing off each other.\n\nThe backgounds take their cue from Arcade games in the late 90s, they're vivid and interesting, the game has its own sense of very light-touch humour, and the 'story' mode is really just a way of saying "play these in order to unlock the later levels". Even so, it does give a sort of framework that keeps the interest level up.\n\nI've been playing it off and on for a few weeks, but needed a game to just waste an afternoon on.  Sure enough, this fit the bill.  I played the first 3/4 of the game without needing a "Continue" (or using any of the powerups).    As far as games go, it's quite easy, and very approachable.\n\nFor under a fiver, it's a good wee game.  I doubt there'll be anyone in twenty years' time on one of those retrospective TV shows bragging over their "Shatter Score", like you get with people bragging about Arkanoid or Mortal Kombat, but it's a fun game nonetheless.\n\nPick it up.  Unless you're a completist, and want all the achievements (which could take literally WEEKS of co-op play to achieve), you can finish it in a few hours.  Doing the extras can add another few hours.  Thumbs up from me!\n","June 28, 2014","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Has a little bit of powerups here and there and "sucking/blowing"....yeeeaaah. Perverted ideas aside, yes...you can suck and blow powerups/energy particles, and your ball to sort of direct it to where you want. Hard to explain I know, just check this game out.

It was fully composed by Module, and it is the ONLY game soundtrack I have purchased seperately (I've gotten soundtracks in Collector's Editions and such), but this is the only game that I have gone back later and purchased the soundtrack. It is amazing, inside or outside of the game.

This game brings a number of fresh concepts to the simple ball and paddle genre for an all new experience. The difficulty curve is fairly balanced, casual players should be able to trudge through but experienced players can find a satisfying challenge. The visuals are flashy and overall enjoyable to watch as many things happen all at once. Although rather unimportant in such a game, the story is cute and creative. The highest point however is the game's amazing soundtrack. Very chilling and cool, I could listen to the album for hours on end.

It takes Breakouts base gameplay, adds fresh unique mechanics and ties them together with great level design, crisp graphics, and, of course, a killer soundtrack. While the main story is a short and sweet blast to play, endless and score attack mode is where I've sinked the most hours. It may not seem like much, but such a tightly designed game is well worth the meager asking price.","January 23, 2013","true","30.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Aside from that bias though, this is actually a very clever take on the old formula.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/amedeus8/recommended/20820/","amedeus8","Comrade St. Nikolai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/amedeus8/","779 products in account","Shatter is a block-breaker game like Breakout or Arkanoid, with a catch: the blocks can be knocked around.\n\nAlright, there's more to it than that. You can knock the blocks around. Some of them are heavy and will fall towards you, pulling any attached blocks along with them. Some explode, some rocket off and THEN explode, some push or pull the ball away or towards them. You yourself are apparently some sort of interdimensional pong vacuum, as you have suck and blow functions which can affect most everything in front of you, leading to some interesting control over the ball. You can even launch multiple balls should the mood take you. And let's not forget that there are vertical, horizontal, AND circular level types, as well as boss fights.\n\nIt's basically controlled chaos. And once you understand how to take that control for yourself, the act of bouncing a ball at blocks can get fairly surprisingly involved.\n\nThe mechanics center around scoring. The only time you lose a life is when the ball hits the wall behind you. If a block hits the wall behind you, your score multiplier decreases. If a block or boss hits YOU, you're knocked out off of the screen for a second, making it impossible to hit the ball until you recover. AND your multiplier decreases. Collect shards to increase your multiplier and a meter which powers your shield and a special Shard Storm attack which can destroy a lot of blocks or do good damage to certain bosses.\n\nSpeaking of, bosses are nice and varied for a block-breaker. They can get pretty tough towards the end, but are never boring. And I have no segue for this, but the music is great and adds a lot to the game.\n\nThere are a few different modes in addition to story. Endless, time attack, bonus, boss rush, and a couple co-op modes extend the length you'll get out of the game. Shatter's a pretty nifty block-breaker that tries some new things and pulls them off well. I can safely recommend it to anyone who wants to Pong a ball about, but is growing a little bored with the same old, basic routine.","December 9, 2013","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You also face off against some very entertaining boss battles that you might not expect from this type of game.\n\nOn top of this the game has a brilliant musical soundtrack that easily deserves a place in your music collection.

Kicking music, eye-pleasing art design, and simple intuitive gameplay make this a caliber of game rarely seen outside of major studios.  The game is short – yes; but it never wears out its welcome and was so enjoyable that I can’t think of any real negatives about the game.

The story is minimalistic, so it's all about the gameplay, which is really good; addicting yet simple. Going through story mode you do multiple stages at once, and in the end there is a boss you need to fight by getting your ball to the boss' weakness. After each stage you get points depending how well you did. The point system is probably the bigger one which makes you want to re-do some of the story stages to get a better hi-score against your friends or globally.\n\nThe game also has endless mode as well as co-op mode if you want to play with a friend, though only locally.\n\nThe Graphics are actually quite beatiful but simplistic. Even the game runs really well on 60 fps see all explosion effects and such.\n\nThe music is very, very good. Not a single bad music in it. Definitely one of my favourite soundtracks ever.\n\nThe gameplay is great however the replayability is a bit so-so. It is a game which you play for a moment, then forget about it for a while, then when you look at your Steam library and see Shatter, then you pick it up and play again.\n\nI still recommend this game, especially if you can catch it on sale. If you are a fan of old games done anew, this is definitely a game to play.\n\n+ Gameplay is simple but addicting\n+ Music\n+ Graphics\n+ Runs smoothly\n\n- Low replayability\n- Minor story","November 26, 2015","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can control the ball to some extent by pressing and holding left/right mouse button for pulling/pushing the ball to/from your board, which make the game course more controllable and less frustrating, especially in the case where only a few bricks left on the screen that are extremely hard to hit.\n2. You can collect the energy awarded after hitting bricks and then using them to your advantages by triggering a bullet time or by protecting your board against falling bricks, and sometimes these abilities are essential for winning certain levels.\n3. The bricks are of various types, such as stationary bricks, freely movable bricks, partially fixed bricks, and bricks that fix or moves the other adjacent bricks, and they moves on a physical and dynamic basis.\n4. There is also a boss fight at the end of each stage. Each time you face a different boss with a very unique moving pattern and vulnerability.\nApart from these creative points, the level design is also excellent: the time and difficulty for each of the levels are managable and never reach the threshold for being annoying or tendious, making you always want "one more turn".\nThe visual and sound effects are good, both in terms of aesthetics and game-playing.\nThis game is a must for anyone who likes this genre of games, even at the original price.  For other players, trying Shatter when it is in discount would not disappoint you.","August 29, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Uhka-M/recommended/20820/","Uhka-M","Finnish Chicken","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Uhka-M/","162 products in account","Shatter is a game taking on one of the older games, Breakout, and reventing it to the 21st century with its new gimmicks such as able to push and pull the ball or objects, using a special attack to clear out some of the more bothering blocks, or playing on a circle area.\n\nThe game is simple as that. The story is minimalistic, so it's all about the gameplay, which is really good; addicting yet simple. Going through story mode you do multiple stages at once, and in the end there is a boss you need to fight by getting your ball to the boss' weakness. After each stage you get points depending how well you did. The point system is probably the bigger one which makes you want to re-do some of the story stages to get a better hi-score against your friends or globally.\n\nThe game also has endless mode as well as co-op mode if you want to play with a friend, though only locally.\n\nThe Graphics are actually quite beatiful but simplistic. Even the game runs really well on 60 fps see all explosion effects and such.\n\nThe music is very, very good. Not a single bad music in it. Definitely one of my favourite soundtracks ever.\n\nThe gameplay is great however the replayability is a bit so-so. It is a game which you play for a moment, then forget about it for a while, then when you look at your Steam library and see Shatter, then you pick it up and play again.\n\nI still recommend this game, especially if you can catch it on sale. If you are a fan of old games done anew, this is definitely a game to play.\n\n+ Gameplay is simple but addicting\n+ Music\n+ Graphics\n+ Runs smoothly\n\n- Low replayability\n- Minor story","November 26, 2015","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I actually found this game through its soundtrack and bought it during the Steam winter sale when it was super cheap. Shatter is an Arkanoid clone made in 2009 originally for the PlayStation network. If you think you've never played the original Arkanoid before, you missed a classic. Or if you're like me, you played Arkanoid, but never realized it had a name. Other than looking and sounding gorgeous, Shatter separates itself from Arkanoid by implementing a slightly more complex physics engine where the player can manipulate the ball via "blow" and "suck" mechanics. This seems like an easy spot for a lewd joke, but I'm gonna try to be mature here and just keep going.\n\nShatter has several game modes including a couch co-op mode, but the only one I've played as of this review is Shatter's "story move". In story move, you play through 7 or so stages of Arkanoid-like gameplay before being confronted with a boss fight. The boss fights usually consist of trying to guide the ball into the bosses' glowy weak point using the blow and suck mechanic. It was these boss fights which highlighted what I thought was the primary problem with Shatter. I found I was hitting the bosses' weak points accidently through luck or random chance just as often as I was while intentionally trying to guide the ball with the blow and suck mechanics. The developers presumably included the blow and suck mechanics to give the player more control over the ball and add more skill and precision to Arkanoid. But it really doesn't matter. The blow and suck mechanics are implemented in such a way that it's still pretty hard to tell where the ball is going to go after you incluence it. Plus the screen is so chaotic and the balls bounce off of objects so randomly that you hit your intended target just as often through accident as on purpose. In fact, I felt the levels that required the most skill and control were the bonus levels where the blow and suck mechanics were taken away from you and there were no other objects on the screen\n\nShatter's somewhat mindless gameplay is given a boost by its impressive futuristic abstract graphics and hypnotic neon bloom particle effects. But what Shatter really stands on is its soundtrack. Oh my God the soundtrack. Standout tracks are Amethyst Caverns, Freon World and Granular Extractor, but the whole soundtrack is top to bottom amazing. It's the kind of hypnotic electronic trancey sound that is a perfect compliment to Shatter's gameplay. It's also great to work to or to fall asleep to. I mentioned in the introduction I actually listened to the soundtrack years before playing the game and probably would never even have given it a chance if not for the incredible music. The entire soundtrack was composed by Jeremiah Ross (a.k.a. "Module") who, to my knowledge, had never composed a game soundtrack before working on Shatter. I'd love to see him get more work; the Shatter soundtrack is truly awesome.\n\nAs I said before, Shatter's gameplay is kind of mindless, but I don't mean that in a negative way in this instance. It's can be a nice experience to put on the game, watch the pretty lights and colors and zone out to the amazing soundtrack with minimal interaction. If this sounds like it might be your thing, give Shatter a try. Or if you'd like to see a modern take of the classic Arkanoid, Shatter is your game\n\nFor more game reviews, check out http://whatisjamesplaying.blogspot.com/","February 1, 2015","true","22.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
