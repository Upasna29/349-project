All you do is grind your way through samey levels, punching samey enemies with samey attacks, and you never feel rewarded for any of it. The cinematics are well produced, the graphics are okay and the soundscape is generally decent, but when the gameplay is so incredibly void of interesting mechanics, and never rewards you for all the monotonous grinding, it’s a hard sell at €50. Even if you ignore the fact that it’s supposed to be a sequel to a series of games that play completely differently, the game doesn’t become any more acceptable as its own thing either. Far better games can be found at far lower prices.

The quest, freedom and diversity we know and love is gone and replaced by an arcade game with bad cut scenes and disgraceful gameplay.\n\nThis Sacred game starts out with terrible jokes and tries to be funny in the cutscenes. From there you go into a arcade score values hack and slash with no loot, no real level up system and very very little freedom. In the first hour of the game you are fighting the same enemies and bosses while auto attacking with fiddly controls and annoying voice over for combos. The only damage numbers are for critical hits and interrupts. Not to mention the options menu that was made for atari.\n\nSacred 3 would be a nothing but an indie game that you pick up for under $10 on a steam sale, if it didnt have 2 very successful games in the series to start off with. To play a game with no real goals and a boring story line that has been used before i suggest spending your well earned cash on something more enjoyable and that would last longer, like pizza or a haircut.\n\nI personally do not recommend this game at all. If you still want to pick it up steam sales when its around $15 bucks would be your best bet.","July 31, 2014","false","3.3"," 1,018 of 1,090 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","018","1","0","24"

A series of rather high quality in-depth action rpg's made into a simplistic, almost primitive arcade-style game I would expect as a gaming hall or browser title, not a full-price wanna-be blockbuster. An all-use ingame currency instead of diverse loot, near to no armor or weapon variation and customization. As well as hardly any attack or skill variation: light attack, heavy attack (shield breaker), and 2 skill slots with 5 alternatives to use in each, that's it, no diverse combat, just button mashing. Linear and quite limited maps instead of a living, breathing, npc-settled open world. One mission / level after the other with point recap in between, just like stages in a 90's arcade side-scrolling game.\nI'm usually the last one to totally dismiss a game but I can only advise anybody to never touch this one, especially if you expected this to be a diablo / sacred style action rpg.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/247950/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2816 products in account","Sacred 3 is the third game in the Sacred series. The game play and design is strikingly different to the two previous games.  The game was released on PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 in August 2015.\n\nUnlike the first game, Sacred 3 is a hack and slash brawler. Every single one of the levels is linear, there are no quests to complete; just a simple get to the end of the stage without dying. There are plenty of classes to choose from at the start of the game with all of the classic RPG ones available such as warrior, rogues, mages and marksmen.  The game play is extremely watered down too; with each class only being able to have two active abilities and a weapon set. The lack of any loot drops throughout the game really means this brawler has no rewards for even completing stages.  In between the story missions, Sacred 3 also offers side missions which to be frank, are absolutely pointless. They can be completed in less than five minutes and yet again, offer no real reward for completing them.\n\nEvery single mission in this game is 100% linear, only one route to the end, and one way to kill any of the bosses. There are a few scenes which sees you running through corridors of falling rocks and lava, but nothing that really keeps you on the edge of your seat. All of the enemies in the game are just more of an annoyance than anything else. None of them present any kind of threat to you and you will not die. I didn’t die once whilst completing my play through.\n\nTo be honest, I am not sure how to rate the graphics in Sacred 3, at times the game looks really well fleshed out with some of the scenery in the levels looking very good. But then at some points, it just looks awful. The textures and background views are bland and very low res, almost to the point where it takes you out of the immersion as you are just astounded at how bad it looks.  Now the audio is whole new ball game – this has got to be the most cringe worthy voice acting I have ever heard. The unfunny one-liners, the sexual innuendo, and some quite blatant sexism that comes out of the characters mouth’s is mind boggling. I did have to eventually mute the game just because I couldn’t concentrate on playing the game because of how awfully bad the voice acting is. The narration through the whole story is just as bad too; the random comments that add no other benefit to the game and only drag the seriousness of the Sacred series down to a kindergarten standard.\n\nSacred 3 is not a hard game at all. Like I said, I completed the whole game without dying. You are able to change the difficulty of the levels on the fly, meaning you have no real downside to starting the game in hard mode and then lowering the difficulty if needed; but there won’t be any need. Once you get to grips with the controls you’ll be able to dodge, outrun and out manoeuvre anything the enemies throw at you.\n\nI was expecting a sort of open world game in Sacred 3, to be able to wander off the beaten track into buildings and caves to find my own adventure; but sadly that is not the case here. The are quite blatant caves and buildings that look like they are really interesting to explore, but the game has put up invisible walls all over the place prevent you from exploring.\n\nThe game can also be completed in a short amount of time considering the rest of the series were 20+ hours. I finished this game in just under seven hours. Yes I could play another character, but why? I would only be playing the exact same linear missions all over again and have exactly the same experience just with one or two different spells to cast. The game has up to 4 player co-op, but I honestly don’t see any reason why you would want to make the whole experience even easier than it already is.\n\nOne part where Sacred 3 does have some pluses, is that I didn’t have any technical issues whilst playing. The game has a wide choice of resolution options, whilst the graphical options are limited, the game is well optimized to run on anything (probably why it is on console). The game can also be played with a game pad, but I had the best experience when using keyboard and mouse.\n\nIn conclusion, I can’t recommend Sacred 3. Fans of the series will be bitterly disappointed with this game, and even new people to the series will find nothing original in here. There are so many more much better made hack and slash games out there, Sacred 3 should only be played when you can get it for less than £3,99 – not a penny more.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/-GxYYR7PJfo\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

They both had decent stories and character progression. My advice for franchise fans, is to go replay sacred 1 and 2, skip this. If you pre-ordered like I did... I am so sorry. This game doesn't even pretend to be the same genre.\n\nThis is an isometric brawler with very limited combat. There are no selection of combos, no character customizaton, no hot swapping skills, and no loot! You pick from a limited selection of skills (you get 2 in mission, from a limited pool), and a selection of weapons that are nigh identical, but must be unlocked through the story. Combat is repetitive, oh so repetitive. Controls are somewhat awkward on the PC. This seems to be geared more towards a console platform in that regard.\n\nThe voice acting is decent, and for sacred fans, the cheesy lines are still there, but that may be all that remains. There is little to no character development, and the story itself seems to be a tired reincarnation of "evil being attempts to destroy world for some reason".\n\nGraphics are not bad... not great, but they certainly could be worse.\n\nIf you want a simple brawler, this is alright, but not worth the $50 price tag (there are similar, much cheaper titles available).

I am dissapointed! There may be several reasons for this: I just came from the 3 week old Divinity: Original Sin, a masterpiece in its own genre, and wanted to have a blast in an aRPG like sacred. I grabbed the game for 50 euro and 8 euros worth first-day dlc aswell. Downloaded 18gigs of game and threw myself at it. I had an expectation of some openworld freedom alike Sacred 1 & 2, lootdrops, any basic kind of character customization and I hoped for an engaging story.. this is not what I got - at all. These first 45 minuttes in the game made me angry, so angry and dissapointed that im going out for a walk now.\n\nNever have I ever  wanted to ask for a refund for a game, but this.. this is a justified request. the layout is but a given path, with a few stairs. thats it. You left/right-click everything to death, and are given 2! abilities to bring to use. it seems like you can swap them around later on though. there is no strategy, no tactical gameplay given, just a bloody 1 track pathway to walk down. It feels like supermario in a nice package & an unbelievable high pricetag.\n\nI would not ask you to neglect this game, just get a firm grasp of what it is you are getting for your money. My expectations were completely elsewhere and thus I cannot recommend this game.\n\nTL:DR This games only similarity to the sacred franchise is the lore.

Your equipment consists of two items; an armoured suit (which can be upgraded but NOT replaced) and a weapon (which you can upgrade and replace). No loot drops other than gold, health orbs, energy orbs and weapon spirits. Skills, armours and weapons can only be upgraded/unlocked/bought with gold after meeting level requirements. You cannot directly upgrade your characters attributes. Levelling a character increases your health and may increase combat arts energy. Completing the relics quests (stars missions on map) will unlock new items for you to buy in store and increasing capacity is done in the circle missions. You can only equip three skills at a time; a light combat art, a heavy combat art and a battle prayer (the battle prayer is co-op only). Upgrading and equiping can only be done outside of the mission quest. More bonus gold can be earned by using combos and playing co-op (this will heavily impact single player as your gold will increase much more slowly). There's no real strategy other than bashing buttons to kill your enemies with combos which becomes boring after a while due to its repetitive nature.","July 31, 2014","false","2.3"," 115 of 133 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","115","133","0","1"

This is true but this is in itself not necessarily a bad thing - there are many hack'n'slash games over there. The problem is that even 'Diablo' (the first one, that is) makes much better work that "Sacred 3".\n\nAlmost every single typical h'n's element is simplified or removed. There is no traditional loot items, no equipment to be found, no crafting, no skill trees or any other similar character development mechanics, no freedom of movement. New weapons, armour and powers (you can use only two at the time) need to be unlocked and bought for gold (not unlike in many arcade games). So, if you're a fan of Diablo-like games, you may pass this title. If it reminds me anything, it may be a tad similar to "Lord of the Rings" for PS2 (and is definitely closer to LotR than to "Torchlight" or "Titan Quest". Also, it was made with drop-in multiplayer in mind, so the single-player experience suffers substantially.\n\nSure, the game graphically pleasant to the eye, but not really imaginative and the cutscenes seem to be sloppy (I understand that you making good looking static pictures is not a simple task, but we're speaking an AAA game here, not some amateur production). Music is completely forgettable. Run of the mill heroic tunes with nothing interesting added for good measure. English voiceovers are average verging on bad, the humour is infantile at best. German looks a bit better but again, nothing to write home about. It is painfully obvious that authors wanted to be a bit tongue-in-cheek take on fantasy, but they did not have any idea how to make a comedic piece. So, really, it is rather disappointing.\n\nAlso, there are some flaws that got me really disappointed. Dodging, extremely important in arena battles with bosses works haphazardly when you're using mouse and keyboard (but judging from the control scheme I belive this is not an issue with gamepad, did not try it though). Saving progress is also unintuitive and it is quite easy to lose progression in a given mission. Difficulty is rather unbalanced - I found that easy, even boring sequences are lead to very hard boss battles. It gets better the farther you go, but sometimes the contrast is jarring what is a tell-tale of poor testing.\n\nSo, for the final verdict - it is not a _bad_ game and forming a party with friend might be actually fun as the simplistic, multiplayer hack'n'slash games go if you don't mind very poor attempt at narrative. But even then, I don't think it is worth half the initial price. And even then, I strongly recommend to play it on console or on PC with a gamepad.

There are no item pick ups.  The world is broken into a progressive map of paths to follow.  The only things you pick up are health, energy (to power your abilities) and gold.\n\nSacred 3 is now very similar to diablo 3 in terms of abilites.  You are given the opportunity to buy abilities and upgrades to those abilites with gold.  But you must also be a certain level to get those upgrades.  You also only get different items (weapons/armour) as you progress through the game levels.  There are no luck of drops for items.\n\nSacred 3 now seems to be an ARCADE style hack and slash.  I feel the focus of this game is now on the multiplayer/co-op aspect.  I dont think this is either a good or bad thing.  Just as long as people are aware that this is now a very different game to what it used to be.\n\nSo far Im not a big fan of the story for the campaign of this game.  It seems a mish mash of the same old "bad guy" out to destroy the world.  The 'cut scenes" are filled with corny lines that I assume are supposed to amuse young children.\n\nThis game is still fun, but as long as you can let go of what the Sacred games used to be.  I think Sacred game loyalists need to be warned of this before buying.

The experience is closer to a very generic bland and mindless beat'em all. Disappointing, 3/10\n\nIn spite of all the rather poor "preview" articles, I persisted in thinking Sacred 3 couldn't be *that* bad and decided to purchase the game (pre-order, mind you...). After all, a hack'n slash IS a hack'n slash, right ? Well... not quite :/\n\nThe game does present itself as an "arcade hack'n slash", but it is actually only a brainless beat'em all.\n\nFantasy action games can take a wide range of shapes and forms, but let's be clear... What do people enjoy in h&s games ? Ignoring all the details, in the most abstract form it fits in 4 major points :\n- Finding items, to improve their strength ; an endless gear treadmill to become more and more powerful\n- Optimising their character, by leveling up, equipping armor pieces, favouring offense/defense stats choices, etc.\n- Defining their experience through gameplay choices (skill tree or similar, inventory, stats, etc. or any combination of the above)\n- Combat ! Well, that's the core of the action, so... It should be "fun", aka "challenging & rewarding"\n\nSacred 3 does not support any of these gameplay elements. The game has as much depth as Golden Axe. This is like Dungeon Hunter 4 on PC, without the (few) fun bits.\n\nEnter a small area ; defeat a bunch of enemies (read "spam LMB", pro-tip use skills 1-2 to kill things faster) ; collect meaningless orbs ; move onto next area ; rinse & repeat. After a few times, BOSS ! Yeaah, exciti... ah, no. My bad. You can spam LMB, but can you dodge AND spam ? Oh, you can ? I guess you're too good for this game, well done, you cleared a mission ! How interesti...zzzZZZZZ...\n\nSeriously, how can a game decently call itself a h&s without having a loot system !\n\nI am not very far into the game myself (and probably never will be...) but I understand the base campaign can be completed in less than 10 hours on the first playthrough. The game does seem a bit overpriced for that kind of duration.\n\nBottomline, avoid this piece of s...oftware !","August 1, 2014","false","5.0"," 79 of 89 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","79","89","0","8"

The rpg bits of the game consists of a map that opens up as you unlock more battles and gives you the abilty to buy and upgrade, other wise you can think of this as much of an 'champions of norath' like console game.\n\nThe voice acting in my opinion is annoying what with the narators of the good and the bad sides sounding like a hip yes someone is trying to sound like a hippy school teen girl and another that sounds like a corny cowboy both argueing with each other.\n\nIf you like hack and slash gameplay then this is for you but if you wanted an rpg like its predecessors then pretend you never saw this game as its clearly milking the name of a game that no longer plays like a game using the 'Sacred' name.","July 31, 2014","false","9.3"," 85 of 99 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","85","99","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/therealhashbrick/recommended/247950/","therealhashbrick","ManiacMal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/therealhashbrick/","2580 products in account","Forward\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n"Let's play the name game!" the developers said.\n\n"You guys have been working on a shell of a game, might as well release it finally." said the lead developer.\n\n"Ya let's call it Sacred 3!" they all said together in a bro-fist fashion, with teeth grinning and head banging, they shout from the mountain tops "SACRED 3!"\n\nSadly the story ends there, on a sad note.  This ladies and gentlemen is not "Sacred 3" (well it is but not in the vein of...you know what, you know what I mean), it's not even "Sacred 2.8 uncut finalcut master faith 360 degrees drop edition".  It is not even worthy of holding a candle to its name, but does that mean it isn't good?\n\nFor starters Sacred was known for its killer diablo like ARPG mechanics.  It was a loot all ask questions later type of game and we (the fans, myself included) loved it.  Sacred 2 followed the same formula except updated it in a more modern way, lots of faults but still the same Sacred type of play we love.  Now we come to Sacred 3, this abomination of a game set in the "Sacred" universe.  Let's go over a few things, as to why I don't recommend it.\n\n\nWHY in spaghetti monster's (insert your own diety here) name did they have to call it Sacred 3!?!?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis question baffles me, they could have named it anything else, ANYTHING and it would have been absolutely fine, but no it wasn't enough, they had to drag the name through the mud.  If it was called "Sacred: Mini Adventure", "Sacred: Not Serious Edition", "Sacred: Battle of the Bads", I mean absolutely anything this would not be a question.  Everyone would see it as an off-shot and not a sequel, just a fun extra.  Instead they have the balls to call this piece of trash SACRED 3, it is not an ARPG, it was turned into an Action Battle Arena and a very basic and limited one at that.  So enough about the name, I think I shared my thoughts on that quite enough.\n\n\nCombat\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nExtremely basic press key/button to slash, press key/button to do a special, press key/button to dodge/block.  That can be good or bad I suposse.  On one hand it is easy enough for a basic gamer to pick up and tackle without any confusion on the other it just leaves combat to a lacking unimpressive grindfest.  The responsiveness of the controls is fine, they are tight at least and you can interupt your skills to dodge/block which is a highlight, "the knight in shining armor" one would say.  So the combat gets a sideways thumb from me, not bad/not good.\n\n\nVoice Acting/Story\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nExcuse my french here but HOLY ♥♥♥♥ is it ever bad.  Not only is the story completely off the rails down right stupid, everything must be a JOKE!  It's like the writers sat down and were like; "Man this game is horrible, let's just make the dumbest thing we can think of and constantly make fun of it throughout the entire game".  I can not think of any other way this was made except for the extreme reason to punish the developers/publisher to even unearthing this thing.  You will constantly roll your eyes and soon just skip the story cutscenes (art with text/voice...).  Nothing and I mean nothing is taken serious about this game, the main villians are portrayed as idiots.  Like a dumb laughable cartoon villian except you won't be laughing, you will be crying at how bad it is.  Your companions are even worse!  They never shut the hell up, they just keep gabbing as you try to fight your way through a horde of murdering orcs!  When you think it couldn't get any worse, it gets worse.  Absolute thumbs down, you will not care about the story ("story" right) or the characters.\n\n\nAreas/Zones/Set Pieces\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is very repeatitive and reused, tons of set pieces are the same and you will see them through the game, ruins, camps, arenas, fire, jungle.  Same stuff, throughout the grind.  There are some story zones that shake things up a bit but they are all linear paths, if it braches off it is just to grab a chest and then come back to fork X and go the other way.  I'll give this a sideways thumbs, again not great but there was some effort...I guess.\n\n\nLevel Restrictions/Skills\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou will hit these hard mid game and even worse late game.  So the base of the whole system is you get xp from killing enemies and completing the mission on the map you are on.  This will then give you some bonus and let you buy skills in the menu.  The skills however are not very different and the whole system is a joke.  Some level ups will grant you companions or lvl up the companion.  You can only go into areas that are your level or lower, so you will get level blocked at some point, what that means is even if you are doing the extra side quest areas you will need to redo a story mode or arena map multiple times just to level up and move on.  Trust me this made me want to quit more times than I can count but I kept treading on.  By the end of the game you aren't even half way leveled up, they have the balls to say, "well play the game again!".  No sir! no sir I will not.  This gets a huge thumbs down from me, level blocking is a horrible system to make a player waste more time in their game doing the same crap they already been through, no one likes that, no one has fun.  No Fun Allowed!\n\n\nOnline Co-op/Drop In-Out\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo if you are lucky to even find anyone online (I found one guy once...) you can drop-in their game or they can drop in yours.  This is neither fun, nor does it help, nor does it hurt.  They are just there...  It's like a ghost on your screen, killing stuff while you kill stuff as you have been killing stuff, with no gain.  There is no reason to play this game co-op unless you just want to play with your siblings or friend.  It is a system that works, but not desired.  Sideways thumb.\n\n\nClosing Arguments\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt's an action game take it for what it is worth.  Is it worth playing, that is up in the air.  From the fun I had with it (extremely short time, rest felt like I was doing it just to finish it) I would say it isn't worth even bothering loading it up.  It's not a Sacred game, I made that point very clear.  So take it for what you want.\n\n\nFinal Verdict\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nCombat - Sideways Thumb, ok\nVoice Acting - Thumb so very far down I'm pointing straight at hell itself\nAreas/Set Pieces - Sideways Thumb, meh\nLevel Restrictions/Skills - Thumb down, shame on you developers!\nOnline Co-op - Sideway thumb, alrighty then\n\nRating: 2 Stinky Fish and an octopus (You might not mind the octopus, but the stinky fish will deter you otherwise)\n\nPlease friends! Move along, nothing to see here.  For those that dare to dream, I'll just say I warned you.","November 2, 2015","false","8.6"," 80 of 92 people (87%) found this review helpful 32 people found this review funny","87","80","92","32","4"

The background dialogue is extremely cheesy to the point it's almost as if they were not trying. I got tired of listening to it, and I had to turn it off, which if you knew me, you would know I can exert a fair amount of patience, but this was consistant inane chatter that didn't in any way provide to the story.\n\n2.) I was admittedly taken aback by the genre change, I consider it my fault that I did not research about the game before it came out, however I did not expect them to make such a drastic change in gameplay from what was a great breath of fresh air if you were either tired of or not really into diablo.  Anyways, it is very linear, no choices, and your guided by an annoying half-wit.\n\n3.) Character customization is rather limited, you have weapons to choose from that have various percent chance passives, and 2 sets of skills with 2-3 choices each, which inside, have only 1-2 customizations inside there.  Which is a drastic reduction in skills from the previous Sacred titles.  As far as loot and weapons and feeling the "reward" from killing a boss just forget about it.  You get some gold coins, which you lose almost immediatly because the game was designed for you to farm the same levels OVER and OVER and spend it on upgrades for your character.\n\n4.)  In the story levels, you are forced into silly scenarios where an elite just happens to have the key you need, to a door that will continue your journey.  Maybe it's nothing, but with previous arguments of the perception of them not trying very hard, this kinda rubs me the wrong way.  I spent more time thinking of why the first antagonist did the classic "AHA I have destroyed your only way to me, EXCEPT for this one LOCKED door, to which I put the key in my minions hands!  I shall make this mistake repeatedly, over and over, and NEVER learn from my mistakes!".  You would think the emperor would eventually put out an all points bulletin reminding his generals NOT to leave keys with their subordinates.\n\n5.) Oh and something was buggy with the online portion of the game, I wanted to try teaming up with random strangers and was stuck in offline mode for some reason.  If I even cared about the game at this point maybe I would look into it, but after I click "Post Review" I am just gonna delete it from the hard drive.","August 6, 2014","false","4.3"," 60 of 63 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","60","63","0","2"

The fact you only get 3 different weps was a big drag.   You do not get drops of weapons or armour but rather you get pre selected armour and weps based on the stages you beat.  The game isn't that long either I beat it on the xbox 360.   The skills are few like 4 light skills only can pick one of the 4 and 3 heavy skills again one of the 3 heavy.  As you level the skills unlock and they got a little power up tree per each skills that again you can pick upgrades to the skills as you level.   The highest i got was about level 27.  Once the game is beaten you unlock a harder level in which you can get more items and more upgrades to the weps if you can manage to beat the insanely tough stages.   I still like the game but wish it had the same style of that of the Sacred 1 and 2 to where you could explore a vast world filled with quests and loot to find.   The game stages never changes so be prepared to play the exact same stages over and over to gass up in level.  Had i know it would be a story driven no loot game i would not have bout it.  But alas i did so i have to deal with it.   But if you like hack and slash with limited skills and no real loot just gold, health drops, enegy drops  for your skills, and spirit drops  then this game would be right up your ally.  To be fair though i put in many hours in this game!! More on xbox then on PC but it still a good game.  More of a gauntlet style game and the challenging on the deity level is really challenging when your level 25 and if you like challenges like I do you will find yourself trying to beef up your level so you can go through that mode and see what the other weps and armour addons look like.   To me i give it a 6 out of 10 in way of just fun push the button action.  But again if your like me and was expecting Sacred 2 styled fighting then you will be highy disappointed!!","July 31, 2014","false","4.2"," 85 of 101 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","85","101","0","2"

It has nothing in common with the Sacred Franchise. Do not buy if you want a new sacred game. There are no quests, no open world, not even item looting, no horses etc.etc.\nAlso it's HEAVILY optimized for controller use, I highly recommend either buying it for console, or plugging in a controller while playing this. With keyboard + Mouse it's really, really tedious to play.\n\nThat being said, the gameplay is not that bad in itself. I can imagine this being a lot of fun in local co-op on a console version. You fight your way through various, very straightforward missions. Gameplay is fluid, fast and intuitive (At least if you play with a controller.)\nSkill customization is slightly lacking but decent enough. If you look for some fast paced action hack'n'slay this is a pretty good game.\nFinal word: It barely resembles a RPG (There is level progression and that's about it.) and should never have been released under the name Sacred 3.\n\nThe reason I give this game a thumbs down ultimately boils down to the really bad online play. I haven't had any game having annoying lags like this one does in a long time. Tried with 5 different people, there is ALWAYS lag and warping around going on. That is unacceptable for a multiplayer title like this.

I really want to.... I really wanted to like this game.... but still can't recommend it and here's why.\n\nFirstly I'd like to point out that I know this isn't truly a sequel to Sacred 2 and that my opinion on the game isn't influenced by this, I wanted to give an unbiased opinion on this game as a stand alone.\n\nSo as you may be aware it's a linear action RPG.... and by linear every single map is virtually a straight line with no chance of going off and exploring the areas. The map zones are nice and the graphics are good enough; but you always feel really limited over what you can do. Aside from the fighting you get to run along a corridor and avoid falling debris..... on every major map zone - not always debris, maybe lightning, but basically the same thing and it gets repetitive quickly. Same goes for turning a wheel 6 times to move a bridge, open a door etc - happens too often and it becomes doing the same thing again and again.\n\nThe controls feel weird at first but after a few zones you get used to them although even at the end you'll miss attacks or dodge in the wrong direction after you've lost the cursor on screen in amongst the action.\n\nThe different characters are varied enough with some options to change and upgrade attacks and weapons which is done by coins collected during missions. The lack of loot in game felt odd but wasn't as bad as I thought (and I love looting in games usually) so don't let this put you off.\n\nAs for the dialogue..... well..... they try and be funny.... main word being try. Sometimes they get it right and it can make you laugh, but a lot of the time it'll make you groan at how silly it is.\n\nOh and you get a spirit which is meant to help you out and talks as you fight........ by the end I'd been called babycakes at least 100 times - and that was annoying the first time!\n\nTo give you an idea on how long the game it, I've completed the main quest without skipping a zone in just under 9 hours - there is an option to play online with others but I'd never seen more than 4 people online at once.\n\nSo like I said I wanted to like this game, I am a big RPG fan especially action-RPGs and didn't want the fact it was not Sacred 2 to change that, but on it's own it's just not a good enough game. Fans of the genre should wait for a sale - I picked it up for £3 so am happy with that with what I got - it's not worth the £15 it's currently priced it.","August 1, 2015","false","8.7"," 56 of 64 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","56","64","4","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ammokay/recommended/247950/","ammokay","Grombur","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ammokay/","571 products in account","This is Sacred no more!\n\nAs a first-hour-fan of the Sacred series it was a punch in my face when i heard that Ascaron had to close its doors after they developed Sacred 2. Nevertheless i looked forward to Sacred 3, happy about the fact that the franchise will live on. However i am deeply disappointed by what Sacred 3 has become. Everything that made the original games fun and enjoyable has been ripped off in a way, that i have to call it rude.\n\nBasically there's nothing left in Sacred 3 that we know of the former games except the Seraphim class and the name of the realm, Ancaria:\n\n1: No open world\n2: No in depth skill system\n3: No character customization\n4: Background / Lore\n\n1\nThe "world" in Sacred 3 is mission based. Every mission takes place in a linear level with recurring gameplay elements:\n- Fight\n- Dodge\n- Boss\n\nOk, maybe we have to fight, dodge, fight and then boss, but that's basically everything there is. The level's details are in fact beautiful i have to admit.\n\n\n2I remember reading, printing and studying countless class guides for Sacred 2 for hours, everywhere and anytime i could (BfG Sera, anyone?). All this has become nonrelevant in Sacred 3. You're limited to a skill system with a maximum of two choices at certain character levels. Ok, that was somewhat similar in Sacred 2, however, since you have no gear to choose from, except 3 weapons bound to your class, the skill system feels shallow at best. Your armor gets upgraded automatically at certain levels and has a more cosmetical feel than anything else. Also, there are no weapon sockets anymore, instead you unlock weapon spirits whom provide certain bonuses. Those weapon spirits, unfortunately, feel like commenting on your actions in a manner, that i'd love to play the game in an ancient, long forgotten language, i simply can't understand...\n\n\n3Hairstyle? Haircolor? It wasn't much in Sacred 2, but at least it was something. Combined with your hardly gathered armor set you still felt like caring for that character you played. In Sacred 3, you can't even name your figure. Everything's predefined and done for you already. Level 6? Ok, my armor got upgraded visually, automatically, done. No loot. Just gold to unlock your next skills, limited by character level and in numbers.\n\n\n4To this day, i listen to the audiobooks released with and around Sacred 2. I clearly remember helping Hansi Kürsch and his band Blind Guardian, retrieving their stolen instruments, so that they can do their ingame "live"-performance. I remember the conflict between elves and humans and their very own agenda within Ancaria, aswell as helping the spirit of xmas on that awesome dedicated island. In Sacred 3, all that seems to be gone. As told in the intro, all races send their best fighters to stand against that evil force, witch is noting but some totally unknown elf guy, talking slang language and somehow manages to insult you mentally speaking.\n\n\nConclusionThis is Sacred no more. Ironically, the original developers are working on a new ARPG title they formerly named Unsacred. Due to copyright issues, they had to rename it to Unbended. For their own good, i say, because Sacred 3 is the true Unsacred.\n\nIf you feel like forgetting about this game's title, you may end up playing a simple, somewhat entertaining hack'n'slay adventure. If you're new to that genre, this game feels like it's made for that let's-see-how-i-perform-on-those-controller-buttons experience. If you're looking for a worthy successor of the Sacred series, wait for, and support Unbended.\n\nPros:\n- Graphically beautiful\n- Fluently playable, even on lower end rigs\n- Music\n\nCons:\n- Castrated skill system\n- No open world\n- No loot system\n- No exploration\n- Flat story\n- Flat characters\n- Miserable, bothersome humor\n- Repetitive gameplay elements","August 1, 2014","false","2.7"," 51 of 57 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","51","57","0","1"

I was well aware of the community's warnings and disapproval, but I still got it for the sake of clarity and some itch to keep supporting a previously good developer. Even though it isn't even Ascaron Entertainment that is behind it, I still felt they wouldn't let a game reputation like Sacred slip so easily into wrong hands. (Which... It seems they might actually have..)\n\nFirst and foremost, the story...\nThe first game was brilliant where magic was just magic, where you had to gather elements to defeat a loose Sakkara demon. As fantasy-RPG as it gets.\nThe second game then tried to explain how everything magical was actually run by T-energy, which had started pouring into the world and corrupt it. For the sake of the story, I won't spoil more than that, but it had enough going to keep you going to see what was behind it all.\nBut now with the third game, I don't see any of the T-energy or any enticing lore that keeps you wanting to progress through the story. On top of that, they made it entirely linear, even less open-worlded than Diablo.\n\nGameplay...\nFirst and second game was a lovely free-roaming RPG with vast maps and plenty of quests to do along the main one. It was also hack-n-slash and focused on classic gear gathering and skill-progressing. And the combo system in the first game was brilliant, to say the least.\nSacred 3 has lost all of this, except the hack-n-slash. No excitement for finding legendary gear and enhance it, no stunning combos which they otherwise boasted about a whole lot, compared to previous games AND went to feel like a side-scroller instead of open-worlded.\n\nPros and Cons about the game...\nTo try not comparing it with the previous games, since it's obviously not; looking at it as the ARPG, hack-n-slash it tries to be, I have to admit it's still fun and challenging and accomplishes what it tries to do. I can imagine it works perfectly fine on console and I find myself compelled to continue playing just to see how powerful I am capable of becoming, but I can already imagine that it turns into a boring grind when you start up new characters after first run through. Controls feels weird when using keyboard/mouse though, so I'd recommend a controller.\n\nSo, pro is that they managed to make a decent isometric brawler, but lacks a lot compared to other brawlers.\nThe cons is that they went WAAAY off their usual way, making one question if they just made it to try expanding into the console and DLC world for the sake of money.\n\nFinally, my recommendation...\nIf you are a fan of the previous Sacred games, don't buy this. You'll be severely disappointed and likely come to hate yourself for buying it.\nIf you like side-scrolling, hack-n-slash, brawlers with beautiful graphics and fairly challenging combat (If you play on the hardest difficulty) and don't mind that the price is fairly high due to the title's previous reputation. I would still not recommend it, compared to other brawlers or hack-n-slash. Bastion, Transistor and Diablo does a far better job.","August 1, 2014","false","9.8"," 53 of 62 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","53","62","0","1"

U can`t really spend any poits and level up anything.

It is highly disappointing for the type of game a Sacred player would be expecting.\n\nNo open world. It is a linear path at all times, no sidequests to be had. You can go back and forth along the story path to select and re/play missions, but the freedom to explore is simply not there.\n\nNo loot to find. You earn gold and a limited selection of new items/item levels/skills, then must upgrade the the items and skills with the gold you earn. A dull and uninteresting system coming off of Sacred and Sacred 2.\n\nI cannot recommend this game as a sequel to the Sacred franchise. Maybe under a different name and a lower price, it would be worth playing.\n\nETA: I have, since first writing this review, discovered that the game WILL NOT keep my privacy/online settings. Every time I boot the game, I have to switch my game mode from Public to Friends Only (my preferred setting). If you have a preferred privacy/online setting other than public, you WILL need to change it EVERY TIME you:\na) Start the game;\nb) Leave a party.\n\nThis is more than a little frustrating.

Not worth £3.99 let alone £39.99.\n\nThe most similar game I have played to this is Halo: Spartan Assault (which I might add was at least fun), this is a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥isation of the Sacred franchise made by a company that has never made a PC game before and apparently has never played Sacred 1 or 2 either.\n\nThe Pros:\nNone, this game has no redeeming qualities. Not being buggy (at least as far as I can see) is not a plus as some reviews have said, not being buggy is expected in a game (if not always achieved) not something that should be praised.\n\nThe Cons:\nNot Open World\nNo inventory\nNo item drops\nTwo active Combat Arts (Skills) only\nAnnoying talking heads\nNo cut scenes, simply still images with commentary\nAwful voice acting\nExtremely linear levels\nNo replay value, levels are linear there is no way to customise your playstyle short of actual changing characters\nPlot is horrendous\nClunky keyboard/mouse controls; this game was clearly designed for console kiddies\nOnly 5 playable characters, and 1 is DLC only\nNo visual character customisation at all\n\nThis is not a competitor to Diablo 3. This is not even like Diablo 3, D3 involves at least some level of skill and replay value, what good is an Action RPG without items and equipment and a comprehensive leveling experience.\n\nIf only Steam did refunds and if only I hadn’t pre-ordered the game without actually doing any research","August 1, 2014","false","0.6"," 43 of 51 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","43","51","0","1"

The kind where you just switch off your brains and mow down enemy hordes.\nOn the one hand, the fundamentals are kind of solid (if uninspired), the graphics are decent and there's quite a bit of variety. On the other hand, you've got nearly everything else. I'll get into its writing in a second, but I do need to mention that the design is awful; some of the character progression is actually ok for this sort of thing, but others just... pop up, randomly, with no explanation or logic. Some of the combat systems are ridiculous, too - there's a "fatality" type move that you can pull on bosses where you just... immobilize them, and inflict tiny bits of damage. Took me a while to figure out that it's meant for co-op play; as a solo player, it's ridiculous that it's still available as an option without getting buffed up. You expend your healing Items throughout the missions without any way to recover them, which means that you may reach the end boss- where you'll likely need them the most - without them unless you refrain from using them.\nNone of the design problems are a huge issue except when the difficulty spikes up, in which case you'll spend a fair amout of time cursing at the screen (the last underworld mission, especially its boss, is one of the worst "♥♥♥♥ you's" I've ever seen designers aim at their paying customers). But that's an isolated case, difficulty has been fine elsewhere.\nI got this mainly to play co-op with my wife, who loves this sort of thing ever since Baldur's Gate - Dark Alliance; the problem is that after watching me play a couple of levels, she wants nothing to do with it. The writing is just that ♥♥♥♥ing, offensively bad. Offensive in its stupidity, not in any sort of premeditated, comedic way. It's disposable fantasy twaddle without the slightest hint of personality except for a smug sense that it's the funniest thing ever, even though it doesn't seem to understand the basics of a joke. You get bombarded with its noxious brand of humor throughout the missions, and it's almost painful. Let me put it this way, it throws in a Larry the cable guy quote at one point. It's even less funny without any sort of context.\n\nTLDR version - It's a brain dead, ok-ish action-RPG with a really obnoxious personality and some pretty stupid design decisions. I'm kind of enjoying it... kind of, and even that in a sort of MST3K way. However - even if it sounds like your kind of thing, wait until it's at about 10% of its current price (shouldn't be long!).\nIt won't be worth it even then, but it's not like there are a lot of couch co-op, controller-enabled games for the PC.","August 5, 2014","false","14.8"," 38 of 43 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","38","43","0","0"

There is no loot.  There are no towns to visit or NPCs with whom to interact.  This is a 100% Action Beat 'em Up game.  It should not have been named Sacred 3, but that is the failing of both Deep Silver and Keen Games.  They should have called it "Sacred Citadel 2" or spun it off into its own IP.\n\nGameplay is actually solid.  It's not inspiring or very innovative, but it is consistent and the controls are precise, simple, and functional.  A far cry from Sacred 2, this is probably Sacred 3's single most redeeming quality.\n\nThe voice acting and dialog are atrocious.  Worthless.  They would have done better to NOT record voices and include only minimal text dialog with as few in-mission interruptions as possible, or just make their own gibberish language like "Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons" did.\n\nThe only similarities to the previous Sacred titles are "Combat Arts" and the Seraphim, with vague references back to some of the original Sacred 1 classes (Battle Mage weapon spirit, etc.).\n\nDon't spend $50.

I couldn't play more than a few levels and it's nothing like the previous Sacred games, there's no open world and is extremely linear with parts of the map locked until you kill X waves of creatures and once you get past it it then locks behind you. No loot system, no side quests, no inventory, no customisation. It feels more like a game you would play at a cheap arcade which is a shame considering how good the previous games were. It's also heavily optimisied for consoles as the keyboard controls were terrible, even the movement was too awkward to play and had to switch to controller.\nThe forced online co-op is also a put off with people constantly dropping in and out of your game with no way to control it (that I have found anyway).","August 1, 2014","false","0.9"," 34 of 40 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","34","40","0","1"

Way i can see it is that developers are just following blizzard. Diablo I was good, same as Sacred I, Diablo II was AWESOME, same as Sacred II but same as Diablo III, Sacred 3 is massive disappointment. But this is much worse.\n\nLet me explain why.\n\nNo more open world, just corridors where some enemies jumping at you. Easy to kill and you would probably even don´t kill them if there is no "magical barrier" every 5 meters that´s blocking you until you kill all enemies and i´ll not talk about those characters that are talking to you and trying to be funny (seriously, it´s really not). After you finish one part of corridors, you there will be some screen with score you achieve and where you can "upgrade" you "gear" but about that later.\n\nFighting is now more like in God of War. Not sure if i like it of dislike it but it´s certainly feel different. It´s kinda fun from the beggining but it´ll not hold for long. And it´s extremly easy! If enemy have some kind of mark above them, you just hit right mouse buttom and he will be out for several seconds so you can mindlessly hitting him. Bosses ... well they have their special abilities but they will tell you almost 5 minutes before they actually use them so you have pleenty of time to move. Seriously, where is the challange ?\n\nLoot ? This game don´t have loot. Enemies just drop globes for healing and money. That´s all. No swords or armor with stats so no more happiness from founded some legendarys. Sure, you can upgrade your gear. After every level in score screen you can upgrade your weapon and armor, for money. That was normal 12 years ago but now ? We want many types of armor with different stats so we can create our own hero and not just use that one which was created for us .... . So no fun in that.\n\nMoving around is also no longer made by mouse, but our famous combination with WSAD with spacebar for jumping to the sides, basicly where your mouse is "looking". Maybe someone like it more but for me, i would rather to use good old mouse like in S2.\n\nGraphic. I know that games are not always about graphic and i like many old games which i still play but it´s becose they have good story, great mechanics and they are generally fun to play unlike Sacred 3. Seriously guys, it´s 2014, wake up ...\n\nI´m not yet deep in the story (btw storytelling is HORRIBLE) so i may update my review but i don´t think it´ll change anything. For me it´s NO and i do NOT recommend this game to anyone who want to play good old Sacred. Just go back to Sacred 2 ..... much better then .. this.","August 1, 2014","false","0.7"," 35 of 42 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","35","42","0","2"

It's gonna be a long one!\n\nAs a long term fan of the Sacred series, cutting my teeth for the first time in the world of Ancaria back in Sacred 1 in 2004, and then on to greater glory in Sacred 2 in 2009... the news that developer Ascaron Entertainment had gone under was a massive blow. Hope was on the horizon however when Deep Silver announced they had purchased the rights and that Keen Games would be working on Sacred 3! Oh yes! More Sacred! More Ancaria! MORE LOOT!\n\nNow in 2014 we finally get to play Sacred 3, so much time has past! Teaser videos and screenshots, discussions across forums about "what we hope for", rumours... finally we can play! Sacred 3 is here and... what the hell is this? This isn't Sacred!\n\nSacred 1 and Sacred 2 were "open world" action RPG's. Classic isometric camera angles, an almost free-form camera in Sacred 2. Tonnes of loot! I remember spending many hours farming for dual light-sabers on my Seraphim... Seemingly endless expanses to explore, lots of depth to crafting your own combat arts just how you like them. Stat points to build character... character customisation; want a character with bright green hair in Sacred 2? No problem!\n\nSacred 3 is none of this. Well apart from sharing the name and "isometric camera angle" - and I say "angle" 'cos it's a fixed camera.\n\nSacred 3 chooses more to go down the route of an "action game with some RPG elements". By that I mean, you will gain XP and level up - but you will have no "points to spend in stats".\n\nYou will still fight using "combat arts" - but its less about building them bit by bit as we did in past Sacred games and more a case of spending gold to purchase upgrades for them.\n\nThere is no more open world. The game starts you off with a lengthy tutorial. Once you complete that, you are returned to the menu where you can pick through locations on a map to take on individual challenges. They range from the main "story" maps - largish maps with lots of mobs and a boss at the end... stamina test maps where you have to hold off against 5 waves of mobs... and simple "clear the map of enemies" missions. After each mission is complete you will need to stand in a circle to be teleported back to the menu to choose your next adventure.\n\nThere is no apparant "droppable loot". Every so often you will kill a mob or a boss and you will be alerted that you have found an item, a sword, etc. However you will not be able to take a look at it or equip it until you have exited out of the current "challenge" and are back at the lobby/menu. Here again you can choose to upgrade your weapon by spending gold to add extra features to it. Same goes for armour, skills, and combat arts as I mentioned above.\n\nThere are no character customisation options. You can no longer tweak how your character looks before you start to play. You can't change their name either. "Claire - The Seraphim Paladin" for instance is one of the available playable characters/classes. You are stuck with the way they look. However, as I mentioned previously you can upgrade armour and weapons - and as you do so you will notice slight changes to your chosen characters visuals.\n\nThe game itself is beautiful, it plays well. The voice acting is awful. Sacred is known for tacky humour, Sacred 2's seraphim often quipping sarcastic remarks, but Sacred 3 is just over-the-top, stupid "in your face" - trying to be funny and failing completely - a miserable attempt at humour.\n\nIf you come into this game expecting a great RPG experience, either as a RPG fan or as a fan of the Sacred series, you will be disappointed. However if you approach this game without that mindset, and consider it a game of it's own accord then it can stand up - just about!\n\nThis really should have been a new IP, or a spin off from Sacred. This I will warn you now, is NOT a Sacred game - at least not in the true sense of what we have come to know. Overall however, it still falls short. To me it feels like a very hollow RPG. While playing I did mention to my friend that it felt very much like playing a Free To Play MMO, very watered down and basic. You will be button mashing in this game - a LOT and you will feel as if it is more a "brawler/beat-em-up" than RPG.\n\nPlaying CoOp was fun however and does make the game more enjoyable. So if you want to play with a group of friends, it may be worth while looking into. However at the RRP of £39.99, I really couldn't "recommend" it. If it drops to around £10-£15 - at a stretch £20, it would be worth checking out. But even that would be pushing it.\n\nOverall it really is a shame as this was a missed opportunity. The engine is smooth as silk to play and looks stunning. If they had gone all out and made a true Sacred follow up with this tech, it would have been a truly amazing experience.","August 1, 2014","false","12.6"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","25","28","0","2"

There is no open world, so the time I spend in the game is spent tackling hordes of monsters trying to level up and collect gold to unlock new special moves.\n\nIf you are looking for a Gauntlet-type game (but even better than Gauntlet), then I highly recommend Sacred 3.","April 18","true","6.2"," 52 of 76 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","52","76","0","3"

I saw the ad for the game today in steam and having played the first two iterations to the extend that afterwards i doubted my decisions in life, i had to have the game immediately. It was total news to me, that they even made another one, so that absolutely brightened my so far dull saturday. But it wasn't for long...\n\nSo at first, everything i say is just based on the first mission and maybe i can bring myself to play it a little more, even if it was just for the money i spent, but i doubt it. But here are some warnings for some people like me, who are extreme fans of hack&slay rpgs like Diablo, Dungeon Siege, Torchlight etc. It plays more like a beat'em up, something like Devil May Cry or something similar, with some minor rpg "components" and here are some points why (and again, i haven't played much):\n\n1. No item drops\n\nYep, thats right, no item drops, just some cash here and there and of course health etc. No stash, no backpack, but then again, what would you store in them...\n\n2. Straight as Hugh Hefner\n\nThis game is so linear, that i can draw you an exact replica of the first mission in ascii art (not really exact, but you'll get the picture):\n_________      _____\n_____        |___|         |____\n|_______________  fin\n\n3. Missions?\n\nThere seem to be no quests (and therefore no side quests of course), no maps, no running around tryin' to get every corner of the map light up, .... nothing. Just Mission 1 - 27 (don't know the actual number) which you have to wade through one by one.\n\n4. No in-game shops\n\nIf you wanna buy something, you have to complete a mission and after the outro of the mission, you get to the lobby. In the lobby you have some (utterly ugly) menues, where you can level up, buy potions etc. No merchant, no blacksmith, just a plain menu between missions. I've seen 1,99€ indie games with way more innovative or at least cute versions for something like this (of course real in-game merchants is by the far the best way to go in my opinion).\n\n5. The HUD\n\nThe HUD looks like it comes straight from Street Fighter 2. If you liked the gothic style HUD from Sacred 2, you will be disgusted by it. The whole time you play the game, you just wait for a camera pan into 2d and a fiery text saying "ROUND 1 ... FIGHT".\n\nOkay, so far so bad, and by any means you could say i should have informed myself better, but to call this game Sacred frankly is ridiculous. This s not an action rpg, this is a 3d beat'em up game with some minor rpg elements!\n\nAnd the last thing i wanna add is, the voice over is totally idiotic and annoyed me after the first three sentences (and i liked the sometimes witty sometimes even a little cheeky humor of the first two parts). Everytime your guide popped up (of course in a comic style which reminded me of some classic games from the early 90s, which is totally fitting for a medieval style game...) i got so angry i started smashing the screen close to where her picture was, just to get some release. And i've been playing the game for 10mins at that time!\n\nSo, in conclusion, i wouldn't recommend that game for rpg fans, especially the ones who like the classic hack&slay games like Diablo. I wouldn't recommend it for beat'em up fans either, there are far better games in that genre.\n\nIf someone thinks this review is not justified and show me some footage or can persuade me otherwise, i will update this review if possible and give it another shot. I would be extremely thankful for something like this, since i paid way too much money for 20mins of gameplay... :(\n\n\n\n","August 1, 2014","false","1.8"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","22","25","0","1"

The classes and world are familiar and the combat is actually fairly decent and dynamic, however the game has changed from an open world explorer with massive character customisation to a linear scroller with almost no customisation and no loot. Some of the pathways and environments are so linear you almost have no room to move your character.\n\nThe best way to describe the change is what happened to Dungeon Siege going from 2-3, the disconnect is exactly the same. The open world with quests has become set "missions" in a bound area which you complete, get a score, cash reward and a lackluster item.\n\nIts very pretty, production values are high, fights are fun but it is NOT Sacred.\n\nOh yes, it has hands down the most painful and embarrassing NPC voice acting and scripting I have heard in a game in, well, as long as I can remember. I seriously considered playing with no sound so I didn't have to listen to the idiotic banter. You feel bad for these little digital people being forced to recite lines that would cause George Lucas to kill himself.\n\nIf you have never played Sacred or Diablo and are around age 10-12 and want to bash things, you will probably like this game.

Deep Silver and Keen Games left out everything that made Sacred great. Instead of a huge open world with ridiculous amounts of sidequests and places to discover like in the first two games, Sacred 3 features a set of missions that have to be completed. The missions themselves are extremely linear, with only one route from beginning to end.\nInstead of an inventory and a huge pool of items, weapons and armor, there's... nothing. However the characters do have a few different weapons to choose from, with no weapon being necessarily better than the other, just different. The only loot you'll find is gold, which you can use to buy new skills.\nThis is a shell of a game that features very little interaction other than killing stuff. No quests, no NPCs to talk to, nothing... just a few switches to press here and there. There is a bit of dialogue during the game. However that dialogue consists almost entirely of horrible attempts at humour and bad jokes... and I mean really bad, like kindergarten level bad.\n\nAlthough this game bears the "Sacred" title, it doesn't resemble Sacred in any way or form. I wouldn't have a problem with this game if they released it as some sort of spin-off or something. I mean it would still be a bad game, but with the "3" in the title, it drags the entire series through the mud.\n\nTo me it seems like Deep Silver witnessed Blizzard's success with their overly simplified Diablo III and ordered Keen Games to do the same with Sacred 3 in order to make a hit game. That plan failed, although the game is fun a short while... but like Diablo III, it gets boring really quickly.","April 17","false","37.9"," 37 of 52 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","37","52","2","0"

So bad in fact that it all borders on being malicious.  I can only assume that the developers had a meeting at some point to look at what Sacred 1 and 2 was and then made the decision to take everything that was not so good in 1 and 2 and make it even worse. Of course there where some good things in 1 and 2 as well they had a look and these and decided that the best thing would be to do exactly the opposite.  This is sure to win the hearts of the Sacred fans....oh wait. I guess they rather went out to win the hearts of some new fans.....why then call the game Sacred 3, why not something else, why go through the tedium of some small references to the previous games and it world when you could have done your own thing. Oh but it slipped my mind, this in not intended to be a good game the intention of this was to cost the developers as little as possible so they could put out a piece of software shaped faeces that they could sell for a quick buck.\n\nSpeaking of the quick buck, as it it a pretty substantial buck, what does this actually buy you? You get a bunch ruler like linear levels, sewn together in a way that makes zero sense, half decent graphics, voice acting that would have been better if they were done by a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ gorilla with a railroad spike through its head. The only thing that seems half fair considering the price it the download size of the game....it.....is...huge. This is probably the only thing that the developers Keen games achieved, I wouldn't have though that it would be possible for such a large download to translate to so little content, but they managed it. Just so the noteworthiness of this is not missed, games the size of single a CD translated to hundreds of hours of playtime, where they managed to get 4 DVD's worth of game to only last 10 hours, nice.... Speaking about the size, at the end of the credits it actually gives credit to some or other compression algorithm.....everyone should be well warned never use this as it is clearly beyond useless.\n\nIt also struck me from the credit that there were probably 10 times more QA's involved with the game than anything else. They, as along with everyone else, were clearly not doing their jobs.\n\n\nIn conclusion what you get with Sacred 3 is a shameless, pathetic money-grab turd dressed up in a Sacred frock. Done by a bunch of useless developers that should probably look for a different line of work. Hopefully the curse of Sacred will find them as well.

If you want it for the sake of collecting the whole series, as was my own reason for getting it, go ahead. Just make sure you don't set any high expectations for this game, and most of all don't compare it to anything you know of the previous Sacred games.\n\nThe in-game graphics certainly look better this time around than they did in Sacred 2, but the gameplay is not nearly as nice - from a fixed camera view, which can impede certain moves in battle, to doing the map one mission at a time. It's true that Sacred 2 was almost tedious in how large its open world map was, but comparatively I'd much rather go back to doing whatever missions I feel like doing at the time and be done with it.\n\nThe upside of this is that Sacred 3 is definitely more competitive in nature now than its predecesor was. You need to reach checkpoints in the game versus saving whenever you want to and dying and respawning at a checkpoint will cost you some of your gold gathered in the mission.\n\nOverall, I really think it wasn't nearly worth the wait for the game to have been released and they could simply have ended the series with Ice and Blood. If you want to play a Sacred game, play Sacred 2: Fallen Angel.","June 12, 2015","false","3.1"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","19","23","0","1"

Not recommended. but where should I begin when there is so much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t?\nOkay I believe I should start with the very important thing.\nTHIS is indeed NOT a sacred game.\nAfter Ascaron Entertainment, the original developers of the sacred franchise, went bankrupt and had to close (It always hits the ones that do not deserve it) they gave the right to make the next "Sacred" game to Keen Studios, a company that doesnt seem to have ever played any Sacred games or make a lot of decent games in the first place.\nSacred fans, like me,  are not gonna get reminded that they are playing a game called sacred if it wasnt for the title or the Seraphim.\n\n\n\n-Gameplay\nThere is none. combat devolves into mashing left mouse button a lot and sometimes using right mouse and occasionally use the 2, yes TWO abilities that they can bring into the mission they are playing.\n\nBut what do you mean with mission, Rank Bobbers? Sacred always had an open world!\nOh yes. it HAD an open world. But not this one. Here you just go from linear mission to mission that goes like this\n-what I mentioned with the so called "gameplay" earlier\n-dodging\n-Occasional bossfight\n\nThere is day one DLC. Also you could have gotten it with the pre order, but still, the more and more I see of this game it looks like they gave the rights to make a new game to EA.\n\n-Progression\nYou do not feel like you want to advance in the game. THERE IS NO FLAPPING LOOT!\nThe gameplay sucks. So why play in the first place? Also, the Weapon Spirits ARE AS ANNOYING AS ♥♥♥♥ING JUSTIN BIEBER!\n\nAh you know what? Im gonna stop here. The outcome is the same anyway and you should know it too.\nDO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BUY THIS DEGENERATED DIGITAL ♥♥♥♥♥SLAP!\n\nYou can use the money to buy both Sacred one and 2 both in gold edition and even then save money.\nI am deeply sorry for anyone who pre ordered like me.

It's a isometric action-fighting game of the type I really like. However, it's very linear, without the open world questing and the diversity of loot and skills that were in the previous games in this series. That can be ok since the various missions are fun, and the graphics/animations decent. I would have enoyed it enough to finish the game if it weren't for the ridiculous difficutly spikes you encounter when you reach the bosses at the end of each mission. Many of the bosses can kill you in just a few hits, and they frequently stun/trap you so you can't move. You have very little diversity in skills or attacks, so all you can do, regardless of the boss type, is brute force attach them while trying not to get hit. Not creative or fun. Given the poor dodge mechanic (see below), how hard bosses hit, and the lack of diversity of skills you have, the boss fights are immensely frustrating. When you die, you go back to the previous checkpoint. If you quit for a bit, you have start the entire mission over again. So the only way I could pass some of the bosses was to replay missions until I leveled up enough to survive them. Very frustrating.\n\nSo, whereas I can play Grim Dawn, or Path of Exiles, or Torchlight, or any of the similar games all night and enjoy every minute, I find that I can play Sacred 3 for a short bit before I am so angry at a boss fight that I want to uninstall and curse the game's designers. I keep hoping it will get better, but it doesn't.\n\nThere are some pros of the game:\n- Generally fun combat.\n- Decent graphics and animations.\n- Multiplayer works fine, though there aren't many people to play with.\n\nCons:\n- No open world gameplay, or RPG elements, or any of the standard features of a Diabloesque game.\n- Linear missions, and entirely linear maps.\n- Horrendous difficulty spike when you get to the final bosses for each mission.\n- Bad dodge system. The doge system is essential for the boss battles, but you always dodge in the direction you are attacking, not the direction you are moving. The movement is with WASD, but the dodge direction is controlled by the mouse direction, same as your attach. So, as an archer, if you are shooting at a creature/boss and it charges you,  when you dodge you just roll right into whatever you are shooting at, no matter which way you are moving. You have to stop attacking and move the mouse away from your target before the dodge, which is too slow and defeats the purpose of the rapid dodge mechanic. Stupid.\n\nMixed:\n- The story and voice acting. They designers went for over-the-top humor. Sometimes it's funny, but mostly it's lame,\n\nI bought this game for very little, so I got my money's worth. If you get it for a couple bucks, you'll probably wnjoy it enough for a bit, until you get frustrated and quit.","August 8, 2015","false","5.3"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","21","27","0","0"

So if you are looking for "loot" to satisfy your inner packrat munchkin you are out of luck.\n\nThe playstyle is buttonsmashing in coop and is allot of fun to do with people you know. However when playing solo you will start to notice the repetitiveness of the buttonsmashing and the "rails" of this rollercoaster ride.\n\nThe game is called Sacred 3 and as such it is part of a  brand line (the 3 in it's name would be a big hint)\nHowever where sacred 1 and 2 are open world games with multi tiered skill and loot gathering, Sacred 3 is more of a hack and slash on rails. Also the Seraphim player character which has returned in every sacred game does not look like the ones used in the previous game or even like the one used in the boxart and trailer!\n\nThe above mentioned odities really give the impression that the publisher has been abusing the name and image of a fairly populair brand to  milk some extra cash.\n\nThis does not mean it is a poor game, as it is actually a fun game in short bursts, but when you look at similar games, the pricetag of Sacred 3 is really on the expensive part of the comparison scale.\n\n\nSo if you are like myself who buys a game on faith and happy memories of previous installments.... then this is an excellent example of why you should always read reviews before buying.\n\n\n","August 2, 2014","false","4.0"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

Its no longer a fun point and click, the controls are completely different,(you have to use a controller to be useable) the characters are not customisable, and the story (what there is of one) is over the top cheesy and characters are badly written. There are no mounts,  you cant loot weapons or armor except from boss drops, and is so watered down its barely even an RPG, no open world content, its plough through level by level. It should be an xbox arcade game worth about £10.\nSince Deepsilver took over Ascarons  Sacred legacy the game hasnt had the same heart. Now they have ripped that heart out and fed it to their dogs.

This isn't an action RPG game like any Diablo game or Torchlight game or Path of Exile, It's a beat 'em up game just like a host of other people are saying. No loot system only an upgrade system. You can unlock other weapons and upgrade them individually but it would require a lot of grinding to do so, since gold progression is relatively slow. The upgrade paths for each weapon don't differ from one another much either. It will come down to which one you think looks the coolest and that is the one you will use. You unlock 'combat' abilities very slowly and then you have the option to upgrade them much like your weapon/armor. But it's just too damn slow. You can upgrade it at lvl 4 and then you have to wait until lvl 12 and then lvl 20 for the next and lvl 33 for the next. Some have even bigger gaps it's really annoying. Why do I have to wait that long to do +20% more damage and or +50% radius or some ♥♥♥♥. It's just bonehead design. Also these upgrades will cost thousands of gold. If it's a weak ability it will start at several hundred and increase to several thousands. But the better abilities in the game start at quite a lot and will cost you tens of thousands in gold combined just to finish the upgrade tree. Why would this game be such a grind fest? Especially when it's boring and repetetive in the first place. If you have to absolutely play this game do it with friends because solo is just boring and yes like many others have said the NPC chit-chat is obnoxious.\n\nHonestly the game insults my intelligence as will it yours. It does have bugs including getting stuck on invisible walls, bosses, corners and other ♥♥♥♥ that will force you to restart the entire level. Also much like people are saying, the game is not worth $50 or even $25. It's a $20 and under game. There isn't enough gameplay variety and it's a grind fest. Also if you like to make your own character you cannot, you can't even name your character they're just pre-made. It doesn't bother me but some people are really into customization and this game has very little, if any.\n\nI am playing the game on the hardest difficulty and it's just easy-peasy. Play it on the easiest... You would probably die in-game from falling asleep at the keyboard/controller.\n\nSteer clear of this. It's a complete consolized game. The graphics do not impress.

It's dumb, hokey, cheesy, and mindless, but sometimes that's what you want. It doesn't take itself seriously AT ALL, and you have to be in for the ride or you'll hate the entire experience.\n\nIn fact, the game I would most equate Sacred 3 to is the recently-redone Gauntlet. It's formulaic as all get out, linear as it can possibly be, button-mash-tastic, full of dumb humor, and complete with so-streamlined-I'm-embarassed-to-call-them RPG elements. And yet, it's fun.\n\nThere's an overworld with scattered, self-contained short levels, there's a few classes to pick from, leveling up is handled automatically a la Diablo 3, there's no loot drops (but your gear levels up and gains new abilities), and then there's the dialog. Ohhh boy, the dialog. Sacred 3 apparently takes itself as a joke, with corny, hammy, 4th-wall-breaking, innuendo and pop-culture reference filled, joke-a-riffic dialog. Did I mention yet that you really need to go with the flow to enjoy this game? I was enjoying it, but I uttered more than a few "ugghhhh"s during my time.\n\nThis is a great pick-up-and-play game, easily digested in small chunks. From the overworld, there's a series of story missions and little side mission things that you can pick from, and after 20 minutes at most of bashing and smashing, you're back at the level select screen and on to the next one. The side missions are the shortest of the bunch, lasting only 5 minutes at times, but they're rather essential as they help you level up (the recommended level on the story missions will quickly outrank you if you skip all side missions), and they give you additional potion slots of various types (health, energy, defense+, etc.).\n\nThe story missions are quite a bit longer. They almost always include a pre-rendered cartoony cutscene with voice-actors hamming it up, they almost always include some sort of turn-this-wheel-6-times-while-enemies-spawn mechanic, they almost always include some sort of dodge-the-falling-stuff section, and they almost always include a big huge boss fight.\n\nI found the bosses to be quite fun. The combat itself is a blast in general, but the bosses up the ante. They almost always spawn other enemies around them, they usually have some sort of environmental hazard around them, and they're not too difficult as long as you can read their patterns. Don't expect to be frantically gritting your teeth while you're on the razor's edge of life or death, but you have to be somewhat coherent to surive.\n\nSpeaking a little more on the combat, in the first few levels, you're just mashing attack over and over, but the combat evolves. Dodging becomes crucial, there are shielded enemies you have to bash, you can leap in the air and slam down on stunned enemies to insta-kill them, and there are spell attacks you have to interrupt before they can be pulled off. It's great. You'll be flipping around the arena, bashing a shield enemy and beating on him a bit before leaping to smash a faraway enemy in order to get out of harm's way. There are combat skills and such that get recharged with dropped energy, but they're nothing really special. Big slashes, aerial attacks, some chain lightning, shouting to stun enemies, etc. They can get you out of a pinch, but they're not enough stronger than regular attacks to be THAT useful. They recharge quickly, though, so don't feel like you need to save them for clutch moments.\n\nThe only real weakpoint I experienced with combat is the QTE "restraining" mechanic. Essentially, if you've really been wailing on the boss or mini-boss, there's a little QTE section where you can mash a button for about 10 seconds to "restrain" them and do small bits of trickle damage the whole time. It's kind of pointless, since you could do just as much damage by just continuing to wail on them, and even though for the most part the enemies stop attacking you (in single player. Multiplayer they keep going), if your objective is to defend a crystal from some grenade-lobbing goblins, they'll keep attacking THAT while you're locked in the QTE. Luckily, you're never required to do the restraining, so I just opted to skip them most of the time. No big deal.\n\nAll in all, the gameplay is fun, but rather basic. Slog along a linear path listening to cheesy, jokey dialog, slaughter some easy enemies and minibosses, turn a wheel 6 times, dodge some falling debris, and then kill a big boss. Do a couple short little side missions, and then rinse-repeat. In fact, repetition is a bit the name of the game here, almost as if it was intentionally designed to be that way. This game will take around 10 hours to beat if you don't grind or backtrack, but it's repetitive enough that you DEFINITELY don't want to do it in one or even two sittings. I've put 12 hours in, and that's over the course of maybe 4 different sessions. I can't recommend forcing yourself through much more than that at a time. You'll know when the game is starting to wear on you, and listen to that little voice in your head. Quit while you don't hate it, and come back later for more.\n\nThe graphics here are a lot better than I was expecting. The geometry isn't Crysis-levels of complex or anything like that, but the texture work is phenomenal, the areas are all colorful and bright, and clearly a lot of work was put into designing unique "biomes" to progress through in the campaign. There's a bit of repetition, but nothing wearying. It's INCREDIBLY well-optimized, too. You could max this out at 1080P with a 4-year-old midrange card and still get 60ish fps.\n\nSound and music are nothing worth remembering, and some of the little spirits you can bring along (they each have certain passive effects) have annoying dialog lines, but the worst offender here is the "help" text. When you're beating the crap out of enemies and not doing, for example, the leap-smash, expect to hear your spirit chime in with "helpful" advice every 5 seconds about how you should be leap-smashing. "Looking for peace? SMASH the enemy... with a hug!" Yeah, okay, I saw... "looking for peace? SMASH the enemy... with a hug!" Yeah, I SEE IT! "looking for peace?" AAGGGGGHHHHH! Luckily, you can turn that crap off in the options, which I did with vociferousness, and you should too. The mechanics of the game are not tricky in the slightest, so why they thought an overzealous "help" mechanic was needed is beyond me.\n\nOverall, if you (and a friend) are looking for mindless, slaughtering fun, and you're capable of taking everything for the joke that it is, you should have fun here. I know I did. If, however, you're a big fan of Sacred and were excited to see a 3rd one come out, RUN AWAY, there is nothing for you here.\n\nThe big test is to watch a video on Youtube. Any 5 minute chunk of gameplay will be indicative of the whole game, and if that doesn't turn you off, check it out! It's worth the $6 I spent, in my opinion. Oh, also, USE A CONTROLLER.","October 13, 2015","true","13.7"," 133 of 232 people (57%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","57","133","232","10","17"

You can take 2 Abilities on the missions which you also can alter between 3-5 between missions(so not much diversity). There are 3 Weapons per Class which are only different in their special ability. There is almost no such thing as Character development except the look of your Armour every few lvl ups. The Enemy types are repetetive and the level design is like a tube. After a few missions you get the feeling,you are playing the same lvl just with other skins and in another environment (which looks very pretty i have to admit). The Bossfights are somehow challenging at first try but then rather easy to accomplish.\n\nSacred 3 is definitely a nice game for casuals and people who want to play with their friends a quick and simple coop game but for fans of the Sacred series and (i have to compare) Diablo like games, will be disappointed.\nAfter 9 hours or so i completed every mission and the day one dlc missions (5 in the Underworld).\nAll in all this game is fun but has almost no replay vallue or longtime motivation and is never worth the 50€.","August 2, 2014","false","15.1"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","1"

It's because they took the basic design template for an ARPG then removed all the reasons why people actually play these games.\n\nI find it astonishing that nobody flagged these issues during development.

If you can see past this, read on.\n\nIf you are looking for a decent, linear hack and slash ARPG with some above average combat mechanics, its worth picking up on sale (under $20). There is not much character variety, but the actual enemy encounters and bosses are fairly well executed. The environments are nicely laid out with overall good art and have some unique mechanics to keep it interesting. I suggest playing on the hardest difficulty from the start to keep it challenging. Once you beat the game it unlocks a brutal difficutly called Deity for the hardcore. There is no loot in the game in the sense of dropped or collected gear or items. Instead they decided to unlock new abilities and weapons through leveling up. Its an interesting change of pace and makes the combat feel more like god of war than Diablo. Which can be a good thing if your looking for something more than a button masher. You will need to have good timing and strategy with your blocks, dodges and stuns to be successful in the harder stages. Play with a controller for the best experience.\n\nThe dialogue is probably the worst in gaming history. If you want to constatly cringe and see just how bad it can get, prepare yourself for an interesting ride. You can easily turn off voice and you wont notice the text since it does not affect the game at all.\n\nThe game can be finished in about 10 hrs and other than trying to max out character abilities or playing on higher difficulties, there is little replay value.

Fully playable with the Xbox controller (probably recommended), this game is more appealing if you are looking for a quick pace arcade gauntlet like game to kill some times rather that a long quest endeavor.  That is probably why so many players are dissapointed, I was not. Probably because with so bad rating, I was not expecting anything great and consequently I was pleasantly surprised by Sacred 3.\n\nDoes it worth the full retail price? Probably not and if you are lucky you can get the full game with DLCs for a singe dollar at Humble Bundle (or wait for a decent discount) and possibly have fun playing in co-op for an evening or two... And this is not THAT bad!\n\nThe only con to me so far seems to be that the developer haven't figured out yet that the voice over in Sacred 1 and 2 were stupid and the bad humor should have been ditched for Sacred 3 (or at least the player should have the option to cut them off...).  But from circa 30min of play, I surprised myself to laugh at some of the stupid voice over, so assuming you only play this game once in a while to kill some times, it should still be OK.\n\n","May 19","true","0.5"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","16","23","0","0"

It's more like the bad ripoff copycat of tube-leveliness. It could be a diablo 1 -clone if it wasn't so damn linear. There is literally no choice for you. The Weapons are determined and level up leaving you no choice but to chance it every now and then. The enemies are straight for your level. And did I mention the "Whoops, look there is something falling from the skies... at you... everywhere...you better run"-Levelpart that will leave you in an agony of boringness and repetition. Again and again. I played it trough in every difficulty on 1.5 days with 2 players. Not every level but you get the deal.\nIf you love wonderfull designed areas with a story that will lead you from cutszene to tubelevel to cutszene then its a perfect game for you. Like interacting with a determined story, while feeling you are not really needed. It's watching a film while smashing your mousebuttons.\n\nBut if you want to see Sacred 3... then I have to disappoint you. That is as much "Sacred" as a Bollywood movie.

I have dozens of games I've not even played and never plan to and I don't want to get a refund for them - I know that if I play them I'll enjoy them and that I'll have paid for that privilege. Not this though. Hell no. This game fails at every level.\nFirstly, it's not Sacred 3. It's a completely different game by a completely different development house. I've heard that they have been working on this since 2010, so I don't understand how they could have failed to have any kind of focus group or input from any gamers who had played the originals in producing this item. It's not an RPG, it's has no lastability, no in-depth world, no enjoyable storyline or characters, no exciting loot drops or character builds, none of that.\nOk, so let's take it at just what it is, a new hack'n'slash rather than a sequel to an awesome game or two - this has no character variation and very little variation in the mobs, a short game world, no replayability, dreadful script spoiling good voice acting, but it does have very vibrant graphics and fair sound. Controls are poor with keyboard and mouse but fair with a controller. There's certainly a lot of action in each fixed arena you fight in, but it doesn't change, even the boss fights are mediocre. 4 hours into the game I'd given it a good try, struggling to find some nugget of gold in this midden heap. It was halfway complete and I didn't want to play it ever again.\nIf this was released on a phone or tablet for $2.99 I could see someone buying it and playing it once before deleting it, knowing that that was what they were expecting, but £40 or $60 or whatever it is, after 4 years in the making???

I was a big fan of sacred 2 which was a good rpg game. What bugs me the most about this game is the set liner gameplay with no no customisation of clases, and the fact that you never change from the default wepons you start with. If you are in the mood for a hack and slash game where you dont have to think about quests and find yourself constantly forgetting what is happening in the story, i recomend this game. How ever if you are more of a classic rpg fan(like myself) stay the hell away from this game it will just annoy you.","August 3, 2014","false","1.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","2"

I actually didn't watch any trailers or read any reviews, i just preordered it because it was a Sacred game, Sacred 1 and 2 was awesome so i just asumed this would be as well, how wrong i was.\n\nAfter playing for a few hours, im asuming the developers picuring the players to be idiots, "lets not make them think too hard about anything". There is no Inventory, the "skill tree" (pains to even call it that) is a joke, the combat system is the most repeatable i ever played: hold down left mouse button until mob dead, Oh it's got a shield, press right mouse button then the left until dead... more mob coming? rinse and repeat (I know it's suppose to be a hack 'n slash but come on!)\n\nAnd the levels are the most linear i have ever seen, it's even a one way trip, you can't go back because it put up some wierd barriers when you pass checkpoints. Gone is the wonderful open world with mounts and everything  :(\n\nAnd then it's the voice actors, saved for a handful they are awful, like whats up with the moaning horny battlemage spirit??\n\nOne thing that anoys me about the controls is that you doge in the direction of the mouse not the direction of where you are going, so you always has to know where the pointer is less you want to doge right in to the firepit...\n\nConclusion, if you like Sacred 1 and 2 DON'T buy this game,this is not a Sacred game, keep your memories and pretend that this do not exist.","August 3, 2014","false","5.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","1"

The game is linear, repetitive and annoying. It's fun for like .. 30 Minutes until you grow tired of the same stuff over and over again. The VoiceActors are terrible (at least in the German version of the game) and the jokes are just horrendous. After the first 30 minutes I could not stand Aria (most likely your guide for the game) anymore.

Levels are unrewarding, the enemies are repetitive and the fun of collecting loot is plain missing. The bosses don't add anything new to the table as well .. it's just the same strat over and over: dodge -> attack -> dodge -> attack\n\nI regret buying this in pre-order.\n\n(I will likely give this game another 1 or 2 hours of gameplay as a chance to persuade me that it's not a terrible game, but I have little hope)","August 2, 2014","false","3.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

This is the first review I have ever written. YES, this game is THAT bad. First let me say that I really enjoyed Sacred 2, which is why I commited to pre-purchasing this game. The character classes in this game don't really differ from one another. Yes, this one has a sword and that one an axe, and then another with 2 swords. With the exception of the bow, they pretty much do the same thing. A short arc swing in front of you and the ability to use a bash (no shield required or available) which also is a short arc swing in front of you. You can hold down the button to "charge" a bash to give it some range but it's still a very weak attack and all but useless except to interrupt enemies who are engaged in any long duration ability use. In this game you will find yourself going from map to map using the same abilities over and over against enemies that vary little. The terrain is tediously boring and there is no room to explore. You go the way they want you to go or you can go back the way you came. The weapon varieties are laughable as they all pretty much do the same thing with very little difference among them. Leveling up is a major let down. No stats to increase, no growth of your character. But every few levels you get the option to upgrade a weapon or one of the very limited abilities you want. You cannot switch armor, you can only upgrade what you have when you reach the appropriate level and graphically it is such a let down as there is no real change to how it looks. The voice overs from "weapon spirits" are laughably horrible. The plot is weak and shallow and all but non-existent. Online play: Your character will NOT be unique. Your Seraphim will be exactly like anyone elses Seraphim of the same level and since each class has only 1 viable weapon choice, (the others are just filler weapons that won't do as well) then you will each have the exact same weapon and be doing the same 2 or 3 maneuvers over and over until you finish a map. Gameplay: Run through each map killing whatever set monsters they throw at you until you reach the end of the map. Hit the portal then go to the next similar map again killing whatever set monsters they throw at you until you reach the end. Every 4th or 5th map there is a BOSS fight at the end. Boring combat of dodging predictable boss attacks and hitting them in the butt until dead. Then hit the portal and be prepared for yet another map of absolutely unexciting combat. This game lacks any variety, sense of character uniqueness, or flash. What you do in the first 2 minutes of game play is exactly what you will be doing after 3 hours of game play, it doesn't change or get any better. It is the biggest let down I can ever remember purchasing.","September 9, 2014","false","26.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The sequel to its predecessors leaves little to the "Sacred" title series, as it is far different--the "red-headed step child"--the "oddball" of the three.  Unlike the first two games in the hit series, Sacred 3 is a very linear action RPG, and the term "RPG" is held very loosely and walks a very thin line.\n\nThe graphics in the game are beautiful, detailed, and the environment rich and fairly interactive, and the combat is flowing and can bring a fun challenge, but it simply is not enough to save this game from the broken chains of what made this franchise so popular.  In Sacred 3, there is no exploration--so put away your maps, and every bit of directional video game intuition you have (or think you have).  Everything is based on a standard, linear, pre-planned map you choose from an overview screen after each level, with no way to go but "forward", and the occaisonal random dead-end so that you can loot that very special treasure chest.\n\nSpeaking of loot, this game does not offer loot in terms of items, but only health and energy (used to cast your TWO powers you are able to use at any one time) and gold.  I repeat:  Loot DOES NOT DROP from mobs or foes that you so diligently vanquish like a good little hero.  Instead, weapons and armor (you only use one of each) are "unlocked" when the game says so--usually when hitting a milestone character level or completing a specific storyline mission.\n\nAs far as storyline missions go, the story is decent and follows a logical path, but the side quests seem out of place (even for side quests), and the only objective you are ever given is "kill them all"...all of them...again...and again.  And if you are too low for the recommended level of a certain quest you want to trudge through, guess what?  Tough luck.  Keep replaying missions until you ARE able to get to that level to defeat those quests.\n\nWhile I somewhat enjoy the fact that you must acheive certain character levels to unlock weapons, armor levels, and abilities, the idea in its own entirety seems hollow.  You loot gold, gold buys you skill and weapon upgrades, and you set those upgrades as active skills that you can use (you use one light skill and one heavy skill)--and normally when you find the best combination of skills, you stick with those, and the endless piles of gold you can grind out may as well be valued as worthless pebbles on the ground.\n\nThere is no character development, other than the "customizing" of your two skills, weapon slot, and armor slot--and they all fall onto a linear path.  There is no developing character stats, no adding talents, no feats, no kind of character traits, no type of roleplaying element whatsoever.  And if you have seen one area-of-effect skill, you have seen them all.  The characters, while they each have their own personalities, offer very little difference in comparison to each other.\n\nWithout a doubt, the game's strong point is its combat and its cooperative playstyle--and it gets old--quickly.  The hack 'n slash button mashing is very similar to the Dynasty Warriors style, with combos, shield breaking, knockdowns, executions, etc.  There isn't much combat variation throughout the entire game, and the fun feel you may have when starting to play the game quickly wears off after a multitude of repetitive side quests.  It's always fun to play with a buddy or three, which is what Sacred 3 offers--and is fantastic.  The difficulty scales to the number of players in the game, and while this CERTAINLY makes the game more enjoyable, there is very little synergy between characters, and it leaves you to visualize a bland series of attacks and abilities being randomly used on the map.\n\nAnother neat addition to the game is the use of "weapon shards", which is just another item the player can equip to his or her character--and these shards will add a buff to you and/or your party members, but also offer a debuff.  For example, the Vampire weapon shard gives you the ability to lifesteal on hit against most enemies you will face, with the drawback of making health orbs (health pickups) less effective.\n\nHowever, these weapon shards, as well as all of the other voices, in Sacred 3, leave most normal people wanting to pull out their hair and throw on music in the background to drown out the INCREDIBLY annoying dialogue.  You are led and directed by a female named Aria, who helps you constantly on your journey--and you often wish she doesn't--as she jokes about every area and situation your party goes into.  Your weapon shards talk back to you, and after every single fight and combo you go through, you are battered with really terrible one-liners by a mage that consistently hits on you, or a vampire that has a "drinking" problem (funny, right?  not when you hear it 100 times...in one level), or a dragon that is scared of everything and literally SCREAMS in fear after every fight.\n\nWhile the graphics are extremely beautiful, and the combat can be fun at most times--especially on crazy boss battles--it does NOT make up for the features taken out from the legendary Sacred 1 and 2 games...features that, according to the developers, "made the game worse", which is a sorry excuse for laziness and flat-out burglarly using generic propaganda with the word "Sacred" in their game title.\n\nIf you are expecting Sacred 3 to be a part of the Sacred games you loved so dearly, then STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME.  It is NOT that game, unfortunately.  If you go into the game with an open mind, like I did, after reading awful previews and reviews saying this exactly, it can be fun for some hours--and then you can write a disgruntled review like I am, expressing the sadness and anger of being conned by the developers and wishing you had done a little more research before purchasing.\n\nIn short, Steam asked me if I recommend this game--Yes or No.  They did not give me a **** NO option, so a simple "No" will have to suffice.  Stay away.","August 6, 2014","false","11.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","6"

I became a little more skeptical after reading about some of the changes made (no longer open world / no more signifigant variety of loot), but I figured I was up for a new hack and slash experience, and it's Sacred III after all (What could go wrong?). In the end, I am rather more disappointed in that it feels more like a combo-game of Sacred and Dynasty Warriors, in the sense that it is interesting at first, but after a while (3-4 hours) I personally find myself getting bored. Graphics are solid, gameplay is fun, and the comedic charm is a matter of personal perspective as always. However, in the end, I must admit I have little interest in playing through on all the different characters, only becasue it feels like it might be a drag. I tried them all out through the first mission (apparently necessary at this point if you want to take them into the multiplayer feature) just to see which I liked the best, and after picking a favorite have decided to complete the game (whatever that might mean) with this character and then move onto something else.\n\nThe biggest disappointment for me was how the whole image of competing with others for treasure was hyped (IMHO) and all it seesm to add up to is getting a little more gold / exp and the completion of a mission. I have no trophy display case or homebase to improve with all my glorious and hard-fought loot, rather I get a screen that is like, "Hey, you killed the most guys, good for you, here is an extra percent to add to the pile."\n\nNow all that said, if there was a signifigant increase to the amount of RPG / Loot /Upgrading side of the equation, whether through a solid patch, or more likely an expansion or DLC, I might consider playing the game further, but for now, I would recommed a purchase only if you are a fan of the Dynasty Warriors type experience, looking for a bit of a time sink, and the game is marked down for sale (think 50% off or more).","August 8, 2014","false","8.3"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

If you want mindless dungeon bashing then it can be fun. However as far as ARPGs go you can buy just about anything else & be assured it's better. Even the lesser know Iesabel is better. The only ARPG I can think of off hand that may be worse is the poorly conceived RAW - Realms of Ancient War.\nIf you're going to buy this buy it on DEEP sale. $5 is about right but not a penny more.\n","August 19, 2015","false","5.3"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","11","16","0","0"

While the name of the game is Sacred 3, it really is just a basic hack and slash game similar to the Sacred Citadel title except priced at $50.  If you were hoping for an open world full of quests, loot, and character customization look elsewhere as this has none of that.\n\nShould you be able to disregard the name and what Sacred 3 really should have been, you might find some enjoyment here.  However, it is not likely to justify price tag.  I will briefly cover some of the pros/cons of the game.  For reference, I have finished the campaign entirely with the DLC character and have seen all the game really has to offer.\n\nPROS\nSoundtrack - Though it is not amazing and lacks something as epic as Blind Guardian's concert from Sacred 2, the music is fine and has, at times, a dark mood that should fit the game.\n\nStage Art - Some of the stages look good and there is some variety in their look.\n\nCONS\nNo Loot - With the exception of weapon spirits, gold, and health/power orbs, you will find no loot.  Weapons and armor are dropped and upgraded on a set schedule as you finish particular stages.  Sadly, weapon spirits are often not particularly useful with the exception of a few.  I honestly can deal with no open world but no loot is a low blow.\n\nRepetitive Gameplay/No Open World - You just enter stages from an overworld map.  Here is what virtually all main stages look like.  Enter -> Fight Group -> Open Gate -> Fight Group -> Dodge Traps/Projectiles -> Fight Group -> Find Key (on enemy or in chest nearby) or turn switch (always 6 times) -> Boss.  Smaller stages will have just 2-3 small groups of enemies or 5 waves in an arena style.  You will probably find yourself fighting the enemies like so Regular Attack -> Bash (when icon appears above enemy) -> Combat Art -> Repeat Until Dead.  If you want to test out the A button on your XBox controller, this will do the trick though.\n\nLittle Customization - You can select 2-3 combat arts for each of the two slots.  You can upgrade these using gold at set intervals.  Often you have no choice on what upgrade you get.  In other cases, you have two options.  In my experience, the combat arts I got later in the game were not powerful enough to bother with.  I used the same initial ones throughout the game.  The same applies to the weapons.  The later ones were not powerful enough and thus were not used.  After trying a few other characters, the feel is similar with one direct combat art and another that does AoE damage.  If you are looking to create wonderful builds then look elsewhere.\n\nLength/Replayability - Even when spending some time repeating levels, I beat the campaign in about 8 hours.  If you played straight through on normal difficulty, I would imagine it could be done in 5 or 6 hours.  The DLC appears to add about an hour to the game.  While you can continue to play the game after the final boss, the incentive is just to level up which, as stated, seems fairly pointless as you do not get much to really make your character better.\n\nTechnical Glitches - Often I have had the game change resolutions or exit full screen mode for no reason.  I have had it crash several times.  It also has caused a popup saying I lack the memory to continue playing.  I am running the game on a laptop with 8GB of RAM and a 2GB graphics card.  I can run games like Skyrim on max settings and this should not be any more difficult to run.  So it is clearly not optimized and has bugs which may never be fixed.\n\nHIT OR MISS\nDialogue - Honestly, I believe they tried to hard to be funny.  However, some lines and interactions might amuse you.  Overall, it seems forced but it might depend on your sense of humor.\n\nIn summary, avoid this game like the plague if you want something like Sacred.  You might consider Torchlight 1/2 or Grim Dawn instead.  You could also wait for Unbended (by the original designers of the Sacred series).  Even Diablo 3 is a much better option given it actually has loot.  If you want a mindless button masher, I'd still wait for a price drop as much cheaper titles (such as Castle Crashers) provide just as much in terms of replayability and honestly Deep Silver/Keen Games does not deserve support for what was clearly a quick money grab using the Sacred name.","August 12, 2014","false","21.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ization of a much beloved game that hurts so much. I do love steam very much, but on this case they should fight for all of us and get Deep Silver to offer us a refund for being the most expensive con in gaming history. I know if Steam flexed it's might it can happen, as I got a refund from GAME for a fighting game that made claims it was the next Street Fighter. It was not and no fault of GAME, but they stocked it and a little conversation with their Head Office, I was fully compensated and recieved a £25 gift voucher for the inconvenience. Misrepresentation is fraud, so Steam would have a good strong legal case under Consumer Law. Anyway, just avoid this utter delusional title and play SACRED 2 GOLD as it is far superior in every way.

There two new mini-campaing consisting of four missions each. There your typical mission. No new enemy types in there.Then there are two heros offerd like a dlc and a weapon spirit that is just now good.\n-On the begging I thought that the bosses were actually really well made and you need to use some kind of tactic to get around them. But unfortunetly after few fights you can see I HUGE amounts reskins that were made and you could clearly see that this demonic boar is nearly the same as the ice golem you fought seconds ago.\n-The constant diaoulog can get very irritating.\n-Mission structure is very repetetive. The missions are a copy-paste of another mission.\n-Difficulty spikes\n-Side-missions and Dlc campaings are making you a bit overpowered\n\nLongevity: 10.7 hours\n\nVerdict: 5/10\n\nThis isn't a bad game. It's just clearly not developed. As the core gameplay is fun, the missions aren't after a while, which make them a chore to go thru.But I had buckets of fun even alone. Now a very important thing I have to tackle is the game franchise. Sacreed 3 isn't the same genre like Sacred 1&2 BUT it doesn't mean that you HAVE to hate this game just for it's name. Of course I have to agree that the game had really stupid amount of Day One Dlc and the price wasn't the best but this game doesn't deserve such huge amount of hate on steam just for that. And it's completly functional. I have only encountred ONE bug. For me this game was an enjoyable game for the weekend and if you are a fan of brawlers I do recommend buying it.","May 22","true","10.7"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

As for combat, very damn limited. you can roll or block, attack and use offensive skills. thats a bout it. if you are not playing on the hardest difficulty, most of the enemies dont even pose a threat, seriously the game is very damn easy 2/5 on combat. after you finish a mission, you get presented with your character, that image, is so damn ugly, that you wont even recognise the character that you picked. Its as if they didnt even bother creating a seperate image for that matter. Over all, game is not worth the money i payed for it.

Your weapon spirit gives you for every killstreak a comment, that stays the same. all the time. and in a hack'n'slay...well you probably know, how often that happens. good and evil-well of cause you fight for the good, no other option here-give every waypoint some ridiculous play of words or comment, that isnt even near funny. the maps are even more linear than the story itself.\n\na look at skills and equips: you have 3 weapons to choose from that differ a bit in crit or damage, that can be leveled up and refined a bit - with 2 choices on its way, same is for skills and armor. armor you only have one. skillset is 3 for each mousebutton. 2 for evade/block move. you cant customize your char. no personalization.\n\ni dont think, that i can find a positive point at this game. it is not published by Ascaron, but deepsilver. maybe that is the problem. even in a F2P game like kingsroad you find better maps, more variations, a longer campaign.\n\nmy opinion: this game isnt worth to be called Sacred, nor the dollars it costs, nor the time(that was short enough).","August 4, 2014","false","22.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

Sacred 1 and 2 are awesome games. After playing this one though, the first comparison that came to my mind was to Dungeon Siege 3. This game is to Sacred 1 and 2 what Dungeon Siege 3 was to Dungeon Siege 1 and 2.\n\nThis game is very linear with no open exploration possible. There are no towns, no npcs giving side quests. There is no loot system, and the skill system from 1 and 2 is gone. The skill/equipment system it does have has some promise, it reminds me of the skill talent system from Mass Effect 3 Multiplayer. Unfortunately, it isn't enough to save what otherwise appears to be a lackluster and short game.","August 5, 2014","false","0.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

First of all, everyone expected the game to have open world which is not. There are no variation to what you can do. The only thing available to you is to kill rather boring single-pattern monsters (melee, range, block... duh!..). If you buy the game for 30$ remember it's a waste. I recommend you to steal the game if you ever wanted to check this out. They ruined the Sacred series, but I'll finish the game if I'll get really bored, because the campaign doesn't seem storyless.

Your weapon spirit gives you for every killstreak a comment, that stays the same. all the time. and in a hack'n'slay...well you probably know, how often that happens. good and evil-well of cause you fight for the good, no other option here-give every waypoint some ridiculous play of words or comment, that isnt even near funny. the maps are even more linear than the story itself.\n\na look at skills and equips: you have 3 weapons to choose from that differ a bit in crit or damage, that can be leveled up and refined a bit - with 2 choices on its way, same is for skills and armor. armor you only have one. skillset is 3 for each mousebutton. 2 for evade/block move. you cant customize your char. no personalization.\n\ni dont think, that i can find a positive point at this game. it is not published by Ascaron, but deepsilver. maybe that is the problem. even in a F2P game like kingsroad you find better maps, more variations, a longer campaign.\n\nmy opinion: this game isnt worth to be called Sacred, nor the dollars it costs, nor the time(that was short enough).","August 4, 2014","false","22.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

Even if you don't care about those earlier titles. It's has nothing to do with the gameplay and as such I won't change my review. But Deep Silver (who the devs lost the franchise to) is now on my blacklist for being real life vilains.\n\nI enjoy this game, had it a different title to ease minds and a 20$ price tag I'd recommend it as is.\n\nYes the levels are really linear but I wouldn't call them boring, they challenge you in a variety of ways that will have you adapt your gameplay. The options you get aren't that limited as many make it sounds. The cut-scenes are well-polished, the dialogues are funny, I like the different characters (heroes and vilains alike) and they are supported by a more-than-decent voice acting.\n\nAbout the franchise: I don't care much. I played the 1st and 2nd titles as time wasters while waiting for game able to outshine D2 (or at least come close). You probably know that already by now (everyone seems to be mad about it), Sacred 3 is a very different game. But it has nothing to do with the fact I do not recommend it. However, if it bothers you, well, that's another reason why you should stay away from it.\n\nTo me the root of the problem is that it wasn't meant to be played on PC, it's a really poor port of what seem to be a good console game. From the settings to the controls it really doesn't fit (yet). Some examples:\n- It's easy to lose sight of your cursor and on high difficulty it often means insta death. It wouldn't have been hard to design one that is easier to spot.\n- Pressing space to dodge (if you still use dodge that is, you should get block) will have your character rolling toward your cursor even if you were moving in the opposite direction. It's very unintuitive. That also could easily be fixed.\n- Limited options due to the initial target (console).\n- Zero way to use the keyboard to chat, you'll have to use the in game voice over IP that everyone mutes so it won't be much use. Unless you playing with friends using skype, TS, ... you won't be able to say anything to your "co-op" partners.\n\nOn that last note, I wouldn't call it a co-op game. Multiplayer? Check. PvE? Check. Cooperation? Very little. It doesn't mean it's not fun to play with others, but you do not need to cooperate.\n\nTL;DR: Different from Sacred 1 & 2. Good casual arcade time waster that can even be a bit challenging at times. Poor PC adaptation. Way too expensive for what it is.","August 4, 2014","false","55.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

You simply select 1 person, no name change, no customization, NOTHING. It felt like chosing a fighter in streetfighter 2.\nFrom then on the game went on, linear hack and slash, braindead button mashing without any thought into it.\nThe voice over is terrible and the attempted humor is so sad its worse than a so called hollywood *parody*.\nI have stuck in there and played on, to see if any shred of the old game returns later on, sadly i have to say about halfway into the game (after a measly few hours), nothing changes, the bosses dont get any better.\nSacred 3 - Worst game i have EVER played, mostly because it should have been this other game..\nIf refunds were possible, this would be top of my list to get my money back on.","August 2, 2014","false","7.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

THIS IS NOT SACRED GAME ANY MORE.\n\n...I'm really disappointed in this game.\n\nA few months ago, I pre-ordered X Rebirth on steam, and received a console-recycled, bug-ridden, unplayble mess. I promised myself that I would never buy a game again without waiting for reviews.\n\nBut I was fooled again, blinded by the pre-order bonuses of Sacred 3, and the fond memories I had of S1 & S2.\n\nS3 is pretty, but that's it. The controls are clearly made for a console. On PC, you move your character with WASD, and you have only 4 attacks/skills (2 on mouse, keys 1 and 2). You evade with space, but have no control on it's direction. Lot's of destructible elements, but you'll often have to strike 3 times before one of your swings actually hit what's right in front of you. All of that make for clumsy control of your character on PC.\n\nDon't expect much of character personnalisation, either. There is no cosmetic or gender choices to make, and only 8 skills per class.\nThere's also a ever-present comedic routine, fun for the first 10 minutes, but it gets old very fast.\nBut the one thing I can't forgive, is that there's no loot. Sacred 3 is a Hack&Slash without loot.\n\nImagine Diablo 3 without items, choice of weapons, dumbed down controls and with only a handful of skills. Would you like to play it?\n\nTL,DR: Never, ever buy a game right when it's release, and Sacred 3 is a fraud for using the Sacred licence.","August 9, 2014","false","3.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It's a beat-em-up brawler similar to Gauntlet just better, although that's probably a matter of taste. The only thing this game is not is Sacred.\n\nI am not aware of any other game on Steam that received as many negative ratings as Sacred 3 has. The reason for this are unfulfilled expectations. That's because Sacred 3 has nothing to do with Sacred 1 or Sacred 2. The game is neither an open-world game nor a role-playing game and the only thing Sacred 1 and Sacred 2 share with Sacred 3 is the name. If you can accept that and you like hack and slay games Sacred 3 is a very enjoyable game.\n\nPros:\n\n- nice graphics, beautiful landscapes\n- character specific weapons, armor, special attacks\n- weapon upgrades\n- armor upgrades\n- special attacks (upgradeable)\n- 15 diversified levels in the main game\n- good DLCs\n- good music\n- co-op\n- multi-player, lobbies are currently full (October 2015)\n- co-op in combination with multi-player (two co-op, two mp)\n- you only collect gold (which keeps you from searching for scrolls and any other hidden stuff)\n- very easy to join games\n- you can join or leave games at any time\n- four difficulty levels (last difficulty is accessible after first play-through)\n\nCons:\n\n- it's not Sacred\n- leveling up can get tiresome. Once you reached level 30 it takes a lot of time and fighting to collect the necessary experience points to level up further.\n\nThere are dissent opinions about the dialogs in the game. Please take into considerations that the game supports different languages with different translations and speakers.\nDuring your journey you are accompanied by Aria, a telepathic, informing you about upcoming events, enemies dangers, areas, etc. She keeps talking all the time and at least in German her voice acting is great. Then you can select a god that inhabits your weapon, providing some special abilities. The selected god keeps talking too. The gods talking strongly reflect their diverse personalities and they tend to exaggerate.\nDialogs are often childish with a strong use of youth slang. They tend to not take the game seriously and are very grotesque. It's the grotesqueness that makes the dialogs funny again, provided you have the right sense of humor.\nI like them, especially Aria is great in German.","October 25, 2015","true","42.3"," 19 of 35 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","19","35","0","0"

This didn't put me off in any way though and I decided that this will not have anything to do with my opinion of the game itself.\nMoving on, I started the game without any issue. Mind you, I have the "gold edition" with all the DLC bought with a bundle so I had a big selection of the characters with quite a satisfying number of picks.\nHappy, I chose a champion and my journey started.\n\nThe intro already slightly put me off with the "oh so funny, ha-ha" worthless dry dialogues setting the whole thing into an stereotype American pseudo-funny-like fantasy casual ♥♥♥♥. I hoped that perhaps just one or two characters act like that but well... no. EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER IS OH SO VERY FUNNY AND HAS TO INSERT A 90S STYLE OLD AS HELL JOKE LINE WHENEVER POSSIBLE making the story into an American B or even C class movie.\n\nThe mechanics are totally aimed at console players and that is not a game I'm looking for. I was looking for something at least remotely looking like an Action RPG game. Instead you have no character customization, no changes in move sets or skills (as far as I got, perhaps I'm wrong, maybe it changes somewhere further in the game but I'm doubting this).\nADDING LEVELS AND XP ALONE DOES NOT MAKE A GAME AN RPG.\n\nThe game seems boring as heck, I strongly advise not to try it, even for free.","June 4","false","3.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A hack and slash light RPG.\n\nPro's:\n-Beautiful level design\n-Many items and skills to equip and improve upon to make your character unique\n-Smooth multiplayer (very rarely has hiccups)\n-Some tough boss fights (A lot of dark soulsy roll and hit)\n-Story is fun even in single player, however multiplayer has its own charm and is encouraged\n-Quite a few playable classes each with their own skills\n-Fun traps to avoid and watch friends blow up from\n\nCons:\n-Too many health drops (this could be solved by reducing HP drops frequency or effectiveness with high difficulty)\n-Some average enemies at times (while fun and overwhelming) can seem "heavy on the ground" with too little health\n-Would love to see one more difficulty setting, ex. "insane mode" or something of the sort\n-not so much a con, as it is more rather just goofy, but the playful tone of the script while also trying to tell a somewhat serious story\n\nOverall this game is reccommended to Gauntlet fans and those that want to slaughter hordes of enemies with their friends as they have in all arcade style hack and slashes.","May 31","true","5.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The main missions are also carbon copies of each other, run from one end to the other, kill all the same enemies, and then kill a very similar boss each time.

Those are open world games that let you make your character what you want.

This game is not Sacred. It just isn't. It's some crap hack'n'slash game that doesn't look, feel or play like any of the Sacred games. It's not the same style, it doesn't even feel like it's the same world. The game isn't just different, it's also bad. The combat is literally spamming a button until a big enemy spawns, then using an ability, then returning to the same routine. Bosses are scaled to seem incredibly difficult but they also all have their own built in routines, stand back and dodge everything the boss throws at you for the first run of the fight and then you know exactly how to fight him, without even being close to being hit. I was excited about Sacred 3 as soon as I heard it was coming and now that it's out it has no similarities with the original. I wouldn't be so annoyed if they had just called it something other than Sacred, as it stands this does not fit into the "trilogy" if you even want to acknlowledge this as being part of the Sacred series.","August 30, 2014","false","0.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

But an arcade Hack and slash like they always stated that it was. If you liked the previous games, don't get this.\n\nStages are linnear with some hidden treasure and tons of enemies to kill. Choose one of 5(6) characters to fight the enemies, each chracter can assign two skills besides the light and heavy attacks. You can also choose between skills and different weapons. Earn money to upgrade skills and weapons to improve your fighter in differernt ways. You also have to make some gamechanging choices on whether you want to use Block or Dodge roll.\n\nThe writing and script is rather terrible though, it makes Trine 2 seem serious.\n\nStrange relations: Dungeon siege 3, combat is pretty simmilar with limited skills. Although DS is a lot more open and has loot. Drakengard 3 with the pretty similar gameplay of simplistic battle system and linear stages ended with bosses. Heavenly Sword, with the combat system where you are expected to break guards and fight different kinds of enemies in different ways. Also, the villains kinda remind of each other. Old Action hack and slashes like Excalibur or any Warriors game. Devil May Cry because - nah just kidding, this has nothing on Devil may cry.\n\n\nWould be better if this wasn't Sacred 3 but rather Sacred Capitol 2 or something.\nPS: If you are looking for a coop hack and slash to enjoy then I would suggest Forced.

It feels almost nothing like older Sacred games. Just calling it "Sacred: Uprising" or something would rise the reviews up to 70%'s.\n\nBefore I bought the game I read the reviews, I played the original Sacred and loved it. But I bought the game anyway because it seemed like a good couch co op to play with my family. And this is what this game is all about, a co op action rpg.\n\nKeyboard/mouse controls are not that bad, but turning animation is non-existant. I recommend playing it with a x360 controller. Keyboard/mouse + x360 co op is working thankfully.\n\nGraphics are really good actually. A little bit too bright from time to time but really good visuals. Aside from non-existant keyboard turn animation, all other effects and animations are very well made. There are so many different backgrounds to fight on, I wonder if they intended to make a instance based a-rpg when they started.\n\nMusic and voice acting are also good. Not too great though, dialogues almost always sarcastic, most of the time it will make you smile but sometimes it gets too corny.\n\nStory is not all that great, I only got upset a bit when *spoiler alert* our narrator got captured and we had to rescue her.\n\nGameplay mechanics; everything works fine, abilities and heroes compliment each other, balance is good. Weapon spirit mechanic is creative and fun. Your weapon spirits will make voiced commets while you play and it can be really funny. There are many different types of minions but types of mini bosses are only two. Actually there are some more but differences aren't noticable. Fighting big bosses can be really fun or sometimes really frustrating. Co op mechanics exists like one player turns a wheel wile other tries to fend off minions. They made really polished create opening animations but they only drop health/energy orbs and gold. Weapons, armor and weapon spirits are upgraded at certain hero levels.\nWeapon spirit drops are even worse. They drop randomly and cover half the screen when they do. There are items which drop at side quests such as potions and wards, I with other items droped like that as well.\n\nConclusion; I'm going to give this game a thumbs up, it frusturated me from time to time, it wasn't what I expected from Sacred but I had fun with my family and this game looks, sounds and plays too polished to get a negative from me. I didn't let my past experiance ruin this game for me. If you have one or two controllers and a friend to play with, this game is a good co-op experience.","October 27, 2015","true","9.9"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

Absurd, low-brow, and extremely silly. You'll get a few chuckles, sure, but mostly you'll be shaking your head. (I play with the orc and he's actually pretty hilarious)\n= The main story levels are pre-set in their level requirements, which you will surpass very quickly. That is to say, the game will get progressively easier as you go. Don't worry, boss fights are still tough and the DLC missions adjust difficulty according to your level.\n= The story? Oh yeah, I forgot. ... I think you have to save the world or something?\n\nThere is only, really, one issue I have with the game:\n- You aim your dodge with the mouse. Whoever though that was a good idea needs to have some sense knocked into them.","October 23, 2015","true","5.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I would even go so far to say that this PC port felt more like an afterthought.\n\nGame complexity: I am not against grinding as a game mechanic, because there can be good grinding games where you're constantly on your toes, and then there's bad ones. Sacred 3 falls under the latter - I fell asleep while clearing mobs because there's virtually no challenge - press button, monster dies. HP/Mana management? Choosing the right equipment for the right fights? Fret not, you are released from that burden in this game. </s>\n\nReplayability: The only reason to try out other characters is to see their skills. You can get the same experience from watching a YouTube video of the characters, then you're back to facing the same levels all over again.\n\nI wrote this review having owned a PSP myself, and played hack-and-slash games such as Dynasty Warriors, DMC3, God of War, Ryse, and many others.

I finally installed it hoping that it might have some sort of semblance to the game that I had played a number of years ago... I suppose that idea was dashed within moments of starting the game.  Instead of a semi-open world it has been changed into a series of select a location, fight through the enemy lines, rinse and repeat.  There is no replayability as you just do the same thing over and over and over again through the course of the game, finish an area, get an award screen and maybe a level up, start the next scene, get an uninspiring introduction voice over.  There is no longer a loot system, just pick up gold that you use to unlock new inventory items that are gained through level unlock... if the boss is too hard, just go back a section and grind it a few times...

If you are looking for a massive open game like Sacred 2, this isn't it. This is litterally nothing like Sacred 2, except the fact that you only get to pick a few characters and no real customization.\n\nThey took a whole new approach, and tried to tap into the more action combat gameplay. Although this game does that quite well, it is just like many other games of its kind, but less imaginative. Graphics are pretty decent and action combat is alright.\n\nSacred 2 voice overs were actually pretty decent, but Sacred 3's is absolute terrible. They tried to half heartedly make the game funny, which turned into pathetic. The best voice over would be the first battle spirit you come across. He is quick witted, funny, and enjoyable to listen to. Problem was that the game made very little indication as to who was actually talking. Pretty much I had no idea it wasn't the character I was playing as talking for a bit.\n\nGameplay is average at best, boring as heck at worst. Every single mission basically plays out the same. Waves of bad guys with varying abilities you HAVE to use to even kill them. Bosses with all the same basic skills, then repeat. Pretty simple really, if they have a shield above their head, you have to knock it away. Otherwise you just keep moving and killing. Like Dynasty Warriors, but not as cool.\n\nThe absolute worst part of the game, is the variety. Every single hero plays exactly the same. Sure you can pick two skills, but most of the skills are about the same. Some are a complete waste to even pick, which lowers the variety even more. You can pick your weapon, but they are very similar so it won't even matter much.\n\nFor the price tag, I would say this game is totally not worth it. There are many MANY games out there that have more depth to them for a fifth the price. I would only get this game if it is on super sale for 75% off or more.","December 27, 2015","false","3.9"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","8","18","0","0"

It DOES however feel like it started as one game, and ended up as another in some ways.  The voice acting isnt bad, but the writing seems out of place?  There are a lot of really bad jokes and some dumb one liners in there, but in a way it still comes off as charming, but seems incongruous with the presentation of the rest of the game.

Go in expecting that and you'll have a good time. It's cheesy, silly and action packed. If you want an easy pick up and put down game for when you don't have loads of time, pick this up on sale.

Sacred 3 is probably the worst videogame on a market. At last it is the worst game I have played and I have COD: MW3 in my library. I make jokes about the quality of COD series all the time, but this game is realy bad. I have played this game for 9 hours - this is its actual gameplay value. It is considered as the RPG! 9 hours realy? 100% complete? I think that I could finish it even sooner, but I had to test it. Sacred 3 has got poor gameplay, story, awful sense of humor, boring level design, dumb characters, dumber enemies... Please, do not buy this "game"! Someone wants to give you a free key of this game? Run! Run and do not turn your head! Nobody will return you wasted hours of your life. This game will give you nightmares.

Camera panning, movement etc is fine and it works ok.\n\nBasic story... like reaaaal basic as in the kind of story you've seen on most other RPG's its not a terrible story but it feels quite droll.\n\nNow comes the fun part the voice acting and dialogue... this was something different.\nImagine going to a comedy show and the act starts: "ok looks good, bit of humour (not normal in most fantasy RPG's) something different. Now imagine 5 minutes in the humour makes you cringe and if it was a live performance all you want to do is tell the comedian to sit down or just leave. Thats the dialogue and voice acting... and the sad part is it gets on you and really detracts from the rest of the game wherein you feel like you're getting the hang of a pretty ok game, something nice to pass the time with and then you get bombarded with humour that is trying so hard to be funny but simply isn't and in all honesty if the game character and story was a bit more serious (including narration, don't even get me started  great voice actor but the narration seemed offish) the game would and could have been a far more enjoyable experience.\n\nWith this said the game isn't absolutely unplayable and is quite pretty in a cartoony fashion but the story and voice acting really does it in.\n\n5.7/10","November 30, 2015","false","0.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

You might say... "how can you review a game that you've played for less than an hour?"  I'll tell you how... the movement mechanic in this game is so flawed that I can't imagine a single person play testing this game and saying... "Yeah, that seems alright." It uses the standard WASD keys for movement but the view is LOCKED at a 45 degree angle to all of the corridors. So to move in a straight line down any corridor you have to either hold down 2 keys or stair step... this is SO messed up!

So if that is what you are looking for, move on.\n\nIf you ignore the history and just evaluate the game itself, it is a solid Hack'n'Slash. It is more an advanced version of Gauntlet than a dumbed down ARPG (the point of view all the disappointed S2 fans take).\n\nIf you want an ARPG, this is not the game for you, limited skill selection and no loot make this a no-go. If you want more of a brawler, go for it, combat is good enough imo, areas are nice but very linear. You collect some money per mission and can upgrade skills with it.\n\nNotice that the controls are better for a controller, so if you use keyboard and mouse and do not like WASD movement, do not get the game either (WASD works, controller is better).\n\nYou also will have to overlook the stupid attempt at humor this game has in really all narration and that you unfortunately cannot turn off.\n\nIf you can look past that, want a Hack'n'Slash, not an ARPG, and are ok with WASD (or better yet with using a controller), it is a solid game. Not outstanding, but also not deserving all the bad ratings from the disappointed S2 fans that are predominantly upset about this not being a true successor.","December 2, 2014","true","24.0"," 35 of 78 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","35","78","0","0"

The game is NOT "Overwhelmingly Negative".  It's actually quite damn good.  The reason people have given it such a horrible rating is simply due to the fact that it doesn't follow in Sacred 1 & 2's roots.  Yes, that's a bummer, but the game is a damned good hack'n slash.  Including all the DLC it took me 13 hours to beat it and was level 26.  I did not do any grinding and I did not do any MP or Co-op, but might venture back in and try it out.\n\nThey should had named this something else besides Sacred 3.   Perhaps something along the lines of Sacred: Ancaria Adventures.  Then it wouldn't had gotten such a bad rep.  The graphics were beautiful and there's a continued voiced story line which was great to have.  The voices were comical and not to be taken seriously, but acceptable and enjoyable.  Lots of power ups and a few weapons to choose from.  Once you get your weapons that's all you get and then you just upgrade them.  I didn't have a problem with it.  There is NO loot system.  All you have is gold from drops or chests and use this gold to upgrade your weapons/armor and buy items (potions).\n\nThis game does take place in the Sacred world and if you're willing to play a hack'n slash beat'em up with this lore you're in for a treat.  Keen games did a fantastic job.  Great game and worth a play through!  8/10","June 28, 2015","true","13.0"," 12 of 30 people (40%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","40","12","30","3","0"

More classes can be bought as DLC. This is not an open world game, you will be running down narrow corridors most of the time, but that kinda comes with the genre. There is no loot to speak of (only gold + health and mana orbs), instead you unlock new items and skills by leveling up or beating bosses. You can upgrade your stuff by paying gold. Bosses are varied (one can be a troll, another a ship, etc) and you need to employ different skills for each fight.

So of course when this game comes out and is not like the other games but in the fans terms is a “dumbed down button masher” of course every fan of Sacred 2 will hate it because it isn't like Sacred 2 which is a Diablo-esque type. What I love most about this game, besides that it ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off all of the idiot fans, is that they made it into a type of game that is always fun, a isometric arcade beat 'em up style game. I could've cared less if it was another Diablo style game because Diablo 3 is just fine and I hear the expansion is pretty good too which I will buy eventually. My 2 hour playtime of Sacred 2 included being killed in three hits by the first two guys that my mage came across, then respawning and using a big summon demon spell that killed them then turned around and KILLED ME, LOL, then I made a warrior and ran around for another hour or two bored while waiting for steam to come back online so I could play L4D2 with some friends. So yea, we didn't need another newer version of Sacred 2.\n\nI am glad that it isn't a continuation of Sacred 2 because I hate that game. It has a crappy interface, is old as dirt so it is not as accessible as Diablo 3 in terms of keybinds, skill use, and being streamlined to include all of the hundreds of little things that make Diablo 3 so worry free. Honestly though I do understand why the fans are upset because this game is such a huge change over the last ones. But like I said, forgetting about those games and judging it by itself, it is actually really fun, especially in co-op. I was just playing online and someone joined my game and we were having a lot of fun, even though he was a complete ret-rd and wouldn't vote on the next map so I had to sit in the lobby with him and wait a full minute before each match lols.\n\nIt truly is a well made game in terms of production value, definitely feels like a AAA button masher. But you can't just mash buttons you have to dodge and be smart so it isn't a mindless action fighting game. This game is by far best experienced with a xbox 360 controller so have one. It has some boss fights that actually take some skill to beat and some monsters that can kill you if you aren't careful. The humor sucks it is just dumb but everything else is well done and the game runs perfectly smooth on high. Great sounds and music, good voice acting even if it is too silly much of the time, the controls are tight, the graphics are awesome, the effects are awesome, the enemies are cool, the bosses are really fun, the skills are few but interesting, you have a arsenal of potions to use, and you can swap/upgrade weapons, armor, and skills. The only negatives I can say are that I am not a fan of button mashers unless they are really fun which this is, because my idea of fun is not a sore hand all day so I limit my time per day with mashers, and it won't save my resolution on relaunch but whatever, I just take a second and reset it to my native res when I start the game.\n\n8/10 I got this for $10 and it is definitely worth that much at the very least.\n8/10 Malakhim character dlc I bought and play as. I got it on sale for like $1.30 and it is worth it for a fun character.","March 16, 2015","true","6.5"," 7 of 31 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","7","31","0","0"

Sacred 3 is not Sacred or Sacred 2. It's not an RPG with an open world where you can run around and complete quests. This is what many people expected and why so many are disappointed. Sacred 3 is an extremely linear Hack'n Slash game with lots of action and (in my opinion) nice graphics. It takes place in Ancaria. That's pretty much all it has in common with its predecessors.\n\nNevertheless, it is a decent game. The visuals are well done, controls are intuitive (if you play with a controller) and accurate. You constantly need various buttons which are much easier to reach on a controller than a keyboard. Further, the game has a online as well as a local co-op mode. Playing with others is much more fun and something I would definitely recommend to do.\n\nThe only thing I found annoying after a while are the comments of your companions. I guess, the developers aimed at being funny. They are not. I prefer a more serious tone in the dialogues while I'm saving the world. It's not the right time to hear about wannabe romantic approaches of whatever kind of ghost I'm carrying around with me.\n\nTL, DR: This is a good game with some minor flaws. It missed the high expectations from its loyal fans and got many undeserved bad reviews for it.","August 6, 2014","true","16.4"," 10 of 50 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","10","50","0","0"

Sacred 2 more recently took a page from other ARPGs, but remained a stat-based action roleplaying game, just like Diablo.\n\nSacred Citidel would have been right at home on Kongregate or at an Arcade - it was a mediocre Castle-Crashers style beat'em'up side-scrolling RPG.\n\nSACRED 3 hads a lot of people frothing at the mouth about how it was not true to its own roots, and it's being accused universally of being a bad game, it is not!\n\nPeople are reviewing what they expected, rather than what the game is. Sacred 3 is a mixture of Sacred 1/2 and Sacred Citadel, that does not try to be an alternative to Diablo 3 (Torchlight 2 is better). In fact, what it is, is a Really Decent classic hack'n'slash adventure game. There isn't much of a loot system, there are no real stats, you sort of have levels, it's not really an RPG. It is better at being what I expected from the Gauntlet reboot (Coming later in August 2014) than what Gauntlet 2014 looks to be.\n\nFans of Diablo? Stay away.

NOTHING.\nThis important premise goes done, because it can help you a lot to not judge the game negatively from the begin, without any reason particularly founded.\nI wanted to give it a chance, after having read the users assaults in the forums, a hatred which, however, was almost always motivated only by the fact that "this isn't Sacred".\n\nSaid that, I like the game. From begin I have found friends to play co-op, and also in single objectives to achieve allow you to play for many hours.\nIn co-op is great fun, the locations of the missions are very varied and graphically detailed, a nice isometric game that sometimes offers beautiful panoramic views.\nThe interactivity with the map is quite varied, you can break any small object, even if it has no utility except for the energy or health orbs.\nEach weapon has its own power and skill tree to upgrade, although the RPG elements are few.\n\nThe replay value is very good, after the "normal" level there are two levels of high difficulty, and the map of the world starts from the beginning, even if you can go in all the main missions.\n\nSacred 3 can give you many hours of carefree fun.\nThe online system works well, and play in co-op (especially 4) is really fun, and it is this that matters.\n\nIf you can disinterest that has nothing to do with the previous chapters, and you can catalog it in a completely different genre, then you can definitely like Sacred 3.\nHowever, if you expect a game similar to Sacred 1 or 2, I do not recommend it, because you will be disappointed.\n\n7.3/10","August 14, 2014","true","162.4"," 5 of 40 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","5","40","0","0"

Reviews and Hate.This mainly contains due the fact that most people judged the game without giving it a real chance at all.Most people simply started the game,saw its not like sacred 1 + 2 and instantly downvoted the game.Most of this reviews have playtimes less then an hour and remind me more of some "true believers"\ndriven by their own madness then actual intelligent people.The Game has a lot problems and is by far not a AAA Game but its not THAT terrible as many people wanna make others think.\n\nThe Game\nThe Game itself is fairly easy to explain : Its a very simply Isometric Action Game with very little till no real RPG Elements with its focus on fast-paced Multiplayer Action.Basically you run around with a variety of very little combat skills/attacks and try to kill as much as possible as fast as possible.You gain xp and level up`s and you can collect gold(which is your only "Loot") with what you are able to buy new skills/abilities for yourself,your weapons or armor.\nThe Game is devided into 4 Difficulties in total and has a max level of 50.\nThe Storymode is not open world,its divided into Missions,which come along with a Recommendation of the level you should have for the particular mission of your choice.\nAnyway you can jump into every Mission at any point(Eg. playing a lvl 25 mission with the player level of 5 and so on)\n\nThe Downsides\nFirst the game is massively overprized on Steam.So like everyone smart should do with any other game aswell : Go check the Keyshops of your trust or wait for a sale...\n\nThe Game itself is pretty buggy : From Resolution bugs till Random Crashes it involves everything.\nGraphics are okish but really look outdated,especially textures,backgrounds in general and the very lowres Overlays.\nThe Soundtrack tho is great.Really nice composed and fitting and definitely one of the best parts of the game.\nThe Voice acting on the other hand not so much... Partly good,partly wierd,partly really bad.\nThe Game itself and the way it plays out is somewhat fun.I mean it doesnt have any depth or real challenge but for a one-time run especially in multiplayer its fun to play.\n\nWhere it disappoints the most is the lack of inspiration imo.I dont care if its like Sacred 1+2 and I was 100% sure it wouldnt be on any level close to D3 or PoE and i can totally live with it being a better melee combat game but its really sad how less inspiration devs gave into the combat system.I mean when i focus a game on fast-paced action then ffs i have to take care that the combat system is more then just 4 button mash.Involve some Combo possibilites,more skills whatever to keep people challenged or motivated also in single player.\nWith 4 people it doesnt matter that the fight and skill system doesnt have any substance since its about having some fun but in single player it really bothers me,that its that one-sided and plain boring after a bit.\nThats btw the biggest problem S3 has overall : Long-Term Motivation.Yes you have a max cap of 50 but srsly after you beat the game once (pretty much with level 25 around) the problems with the missions are kicking in.\nBasically you can just replay the whole game exactly the same way as you did before just with a higher difficulty.\nChallenging/Motivating : Not so much since voiceacting,level design,waves whatever is exactly the same as you played before so that it feels like the additional 25 more XP level where added later to make the game look as it would have a longer playtime.\n\n\nThe End\n\nAll in All its not a terrible game.Its a short,fun,multiplayer-focused action-slasher for a few hours.Nothing more,Nothing less.\n\nIf you want a Sacred 1/2 Reloaded or a new Dia 3 this is not a game for you and you will end up disappointed but if you can take it as it is it at least gives you some hours of fun.\n\nAnyway I´d recommend waiting for a sale or use other sources since 50 bucks for this seems a bit overprized at this point.\n\n\n5.5/10","August 4, 2014","true","13.6"," 30 of 104 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","30","104","0","0"

Erase it.\n\nDone? Good.\n\nThis isn't Sacred.\n\nThe closest existing Sacred game is Sacred Citadel.  But that doesn't make this game bad.  Remember those good old days you spent during your youth? Pumping quarters into a game called Guantlet?  Yeah, this is that, except conveniently located on your home PC/Console, where you can love it forever.\n\nDespite others calling it a "mindless button-masher", there is a bit of thought involved when combating a massive wad of enemies.  You have standard attack, "Bash" (shield breaker), dodge/block, throw/power attack (used on boss type critters to deal a decent chunk of damage), a Light and Heavy Combat Art that use energy, and an Execution to 1-hit knocked down enemies.  Trust me, nothing feels quite like knocking down a group of enemies and then hopping from one to the next with murderous force.\n\nMain levels generally consist of moving from arena to arena, mashing through waves of enemies until the barrier disapates, or you get a key drop from some sub-boss, or you clear X number of waves.  But since you enjoyed Gauntlet back in the day, that's not a problem, right?  The only "loot" is gold, which you use to upgrade your character between levels, unlocking boosts to combat arts, weapons, and other things, as well as buying potions and the like.\n\nIs this Sacred 2++ (thats "2 incremented by 1" for you non programming oriented people)? No.\n\nIs it fun? Sure, why not?\n\nIgnore the fact that it has Sacred in the title, embrace the fact that it is an "arcade hack and slash" (as it says in the description, for those of you complaining about it being exactly that), round up some friends, and bludgeon some goblins or whatever they are to a bloody pulp for fun and profit.\n\nPS: You really want a controller if you're on PC, cause it may or may not destroy your keyboard.  And it was designed for controllers, so the keyboard controls are probably awkward.","August 5, 2014","true","3.9"," 17 of 71 people (24%) found this review helpful","24","17","71","0","3"

I really wanted this game to be a good timewaster but I feel that it's going to be one of those beat it and be done with it kind of games.\n\nThe loot is pretty much non-existat there are a few things here and there you get, however, I don't think they in much RNG involved more of where you are at the level or the story/\n\nThe skills and abilites are nice, but the lack of attacks make me wonder why, one of the warrior attacks does not even do damage is more of a debuff or stun/interupt which is fine but when you only have 4 I feel it's a waste of a free action move.\n\nGraphics are ok.  Playing this at 2560X1440 helps it look good, with some odd very odd coding, as my 780ti will ramp up and get as hot at 79c while most of the time it sits at 66-67, seems as if parts of the game were not optimized fully.\n\nNo sli support out of the gate, (should not need it though)\n\nBiggest Con for me though is the very bad voice over scripts not so much the voices but what they say.  Very corny,\nThe telepathic helper if you call her that can be very annoying, when you have 500 mobs on you and she deemands you spin the wheel, I mean wtf can't you sense that I am trying to but have to deal with the mobs first. I understand why they did it, to move the story along for perhaps the "unaware"\n\nOh and don't get me started on the spirits, the ones the fuse to your weapon, most of the time they bad stats out weigh the good ones or they become a wash to what's the point in them.  All they do is provide more "Corny" dialogue that is not needed, I mean you already have one annoying person talking to you, do we really need another?   Not to mention the enemies scripts.  It's just really really bad.\n\nHowever, if you can get passed all that, and I mean it might take a strong willed person, there is a good game under it all, as it stands it is a beat em up, with a small RPG element to it, and I say small because its more of a straight line RPG, sure you can go back and gain some levels, but then all you are doing is out leveling the content to make it easy, why not just change the diff then.\n\nI don't feel rewarded enough in the game, but I will finish it and most likley edit this review, as it stands it's a good game, with many holes.\n\nWorth the 49.99? No\n\nIf you can get it cheaper the better imo.\n\nI feel this game should of been released at 29.99 being what it is right now.  Finishing the game and seeing what is beyond might change my tune, but I paid full price and knew going into it I was not going to get my moneys worth at least right away.","August 5, 2014","true","6.6"," 13 of 61 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","13","61","0","0"

That doesn't mean Sacred 3 is bad, it is just -- very different.\n\nThe game seems to be geared for 15-20 minute short sessions of gameplay, either on your own or with friends / strangers, focussing on quick gameplay and hi-scores, with over-the-top effects and repetitive sections of enemy waves to re-iterate the notion of "Kill all the monsters, make sure you get the highest score!" While the story is very cheesy and is rather boring after a while, the sound effects and music work well, and some of the enemies are quite nicely designed. Again, nothing amazing, but good enough for a bit of fun.\n\nI've certainly enjoyed playing the game with other players so far, and I must say I enjoyed it. Don't think of it as Sacred 3. Think of it as a co-op-geared action game in the Sacred universe. Is it value for money? That really depends on who you play with, if you're playing on your own then definitely not.

Though, discounting this game simply because of experiences with with the prior titles would cause you to miss out on a world of fun. While it lacks the deep story and customization of Sacred and Sacred 2, the new combat system is a blast to use. The story, so far anyway, is lackluster and disinteresting, but that's not what this game is about.\nFor those of you who have gotten this far, you'll like this game if you're a fan of games like Dynasty Warriors as, ironically, that's what this game feels like. In my opinion, if Sacred made a baby with the Warriors games, this is what I'd expect it to look like. Given that, I'm not surprised by the lack of story or deep customization because the intense combat is the focus. In the future, I personally hope that this combat system is kept and the old system of loot and quests brought back. I really believe that this is a step forward for the combat of the ARP genre.\nIf you can just look past the Sacred title and the history of the series, I think most will enjoy this game. Worst comes to worst, wait for a sale, but I do not suggest those interested in the ARP genre should pass it up.","August 5, 2014","true","15.3"," 9 of 51 people (18%) found this review helpful","18","9","51","0","0"

It is fairly simple in its storyline and plot, but with strong history behind the Sacred world, characters and locations. As far as the game itself is concerned; it is a lot of fun experiencing the comically interluded levels and enhancing one's character to progress, until one tries to complete the main missions on 'Deity' difficulty level, which is a great challenge. I have had a lot of fun playing it and would recommend it to anyone who likes Diablo style games, although it is more science fiction than archaic lore. A good game to play until the true fight begins on the hardest difficulty when it becomes a real key-tapping festival. Despite the 'franticity' as one gets towards level 50 (Max.) in trying to overcome the baddies and complete the storyline missions, it is well worth a crack and maybe you will overcome the challenge.

Good, there are enough point & click ARPGs out there, and the previous Sacreds weren't all that, anyway.\n\nThe system req's should also definitely include controller(s) and a buddy. This game is made for couch co-op; there are a number of game mechanics that don't even function when playing solo.\n\nOnto the gameplay: I found this an absolute blast. The different characters give a satisfyingly different game experience - there's the slow, hard-hitting tank, the archer / crowd-controller, and the fast-but-squishy skirmisher who excells at taking out high-value targets. Then a quite powerful hybrid who can do a bit of everything, and the pre-order bonus char, who seems a bit OP at the start but falls in line after a few levels and most resembles the skirmish character.\n\nCombat is the main focus of this game; there's a normal melee attack that can be chained into a combo, a disabling bash that deals little damage but is absolutely crucial against certain enemies, and two 'combat arts' that require energy, which is regenerated by your regular attacks (the main similarity to previous Sacred games). Then there's a defensive move and a co-op-only battle prayer. I find it fast and fun, but I imagine it would be hell with a keyboard/mouse set-up. It is definitely not just a button masher, there are plenty of situations where chosing the wrong sort of attack spells certain doom, or at least a facefull of sword.\n\nThe game plays through individual missions, in between which you are returned to a 'lobby'. No open-world exploration. You can replay missions as often as you like, which lets you fine-tune the difficulty a bit by levelling up in easier areas if you're finding a particular mission too tough. Some of them are quite tough, you cannot simply face-roll everything in this game.\n\nLevelling and looting is 'streamlined' by buying upgrades for gold, which is disappointing if that's not what you're after, but you still get to make meaningful choices in character builds. For example, some weapons emphasize attack area, some damage, and some special effects like knockdown or lifedrain. At some point, you will have to decide if you prefer to defend by blocking or dodging. You can experiment with everything, as the most recent upgrade in each skill line is a free buy-back, but you will not likely be able to afford to just max everything. You get to pick a new load-out before each mission.\n\nAll gear and abilities level up with your char, which means armour and weapons look progressively more bad-♥♥♥, but this is mostly cosmetic.\n\nThe other major customisation is the choice of 'weapon-spirit': these come with a more or less powerful bonus, and a corresponding flaw; for example, the vampire lets your melee attacks drain life, but reduces your health recovery from health drops. They also frequently pipe up during the game...\n\nSo, to the superficials: Graphics are uniformly gorgeous for this kind of game, with lots of detail even in the non-gaming areas. The sound-track is also suitably epic. The (English) voice-acting is excellent, and there is an awful lot of it, but what the voices have to say is... not for everyone. There's a lot of goofy, inoffensive humour, like what we'd get at the gaming table after a few beers. Some of it falls flat, some of it makes me smile (I love the drunk vampire weapon spirit). The use of accents, on the other hand, just comes off as a bit racist - not acceptable and so unnecessary.\n\nIt's not a perfect game, and better suited to an hour or so of fun hack-and-slash than to day-long immersive play, but it definitely does not deserve the hate flung at it... If you liked Champions of Norrath, Untold Legends or even the fighty bits of Kindoms of Amalur, this might push your buttons; and though this is not a ringing endorsement, it is miles better than Dungeon Siege 3","August 6, 2014","true","17.9"," 3 of 36 people (8%) found this review helpful","8","3","36","0","0"

The basic gameplay is all about movement, controlling space on screen and mashing buttons to slaugter hundreds of enemies - RPG elements mostly consist of gaining XP/leveling up and being able to unlock and upgrade new skills.\n\nOne of the more interesting features are the "spirits" - these give a reasonably big advantage (life steal) but not without cost (normal health pick-ups only worth 50% HP). Some of these benefit solo-players, others are clearly aimed at coop-play.\n\nThe game is surprisingly solid. Considering I have never heard of the developer, I am quite impressed with the movement and the very direct controls. They were not joking when they said this was "arcade" - the controls certainly feel that way, and that is a good thing. The generous hit/hurtboxes add to a very "brawler"-like feel, same goes for some meaty hit-feedback. Particularly the "execution"-move stands out as being extremly satisfiying - even on max-level and after several hours of fighting the more or less same guys, stomping them into the ground still felt very good.\n\nExecutions are also a good example of some of the finer detail of the combat system. You got your basic attack, which is nice and all - but the fun stuff happens with your heavy attack, as it is your tool to get past shields, interrupt spellcasters or knock people of their feet. Depending on your weapon, these basic functions can be upgraded to "super" status. What I ended up doing was using super knockdown to sweep big brutes off their feet and then chain execute them. I honestly cannot believe that this will not put a smile on anybodys face - it's pretty amazing and feels damn good.\n\nOn the highest difficulties these tools become incredibly important to get anywhere, and they add a bit of nuance to the combat. Though, much to my surprise combat (while very button mashy) never became as repetitive as I expected it to be, since most enemies die reasonably quick, usually though you need to deal with a large group of enemies composed of three to four different types of enemies that all need their own approach to be taken down. I think this helps in keeping combat interesting, since you are constantly forced to mix up your attacks and battle tactics - you can't simply spam one attack and call it a day. Even when I was grinding the last ten levels by replaying the same stage over and over again I was still impressed by the speed of which you can dispatch big groups of enemies and how impressive it looks while you are at it.\n\nTalking about looks, the game has some very nice colors and levels going for it - it is a less cartoony Diablo 3, filled with uninspired enemies (orcs, undead, bugs, bandits and knights). Its real beauty lies in the insane amount of stuff going on once 4 players unleash all their powers, Sacred 3 rivals Marvel vs. Capcom 3 in pure "I don't know what's going on"-effect overkill. It certainly doesn't help the playability, but man, it is looking great.\n\nSo, there you have it - Sacred 3 actually manages to be quite convincing in certain parts. But the game is far from perfect or a masterpiece. I believe making it an all out action game would have worked in favour of it, all the little remains of (A)RPG-gameplay hold the game back from achieving true greatness. Combat lacks any meaningful combos, most stuff is executed by simply pressing a button - there is no chaining of attacks into longer strings. If Sacred 4 could shift more towards "spectacle fighter" like Devil May Cry or Ninja Gaiden that would be very much appreciated. The RNG is still strong in this as well, X% chance of something happening is crap design and doesn't belong in an arcade game. Either a move has certain effects or it doesn't - procs have no place here. Same goes for the progression system, which feels too limiting - why I can only upgrade certain skills once I reached Level 48 beats me. If I want to unlock something and have the cash, GIVE IT TO ME! Also, Deity difficulty is a joke - instead of crafting a challenging but beatable experience (even in solo-mode), they just moved all the "artificial diffculty" sliders to max - turning that mode into a "drown yourself in potions"-exercise. Pretty crappy, especially since the game up to that point was actually on the easy side of things and made a point out of feeling good even for beginners and not so much being all hardcore 360 no-scope.\n\nThe biggest flaw of Sacred 3 however is actually one of its selling points: coop. Coop has been pretty frustrating so far - people are usually out of your level-range which seems to be less than 5 levels. If you join their game as a godtier-warrior you ruin their fun, since everything scales up to the highest level in a party. Meaning my level 50 guy turns lowbie-games into hardcore mode, where even the small stuff gets turned into endbosses-material that oneshots the beginners. It was kinda funny the first time around, when people got wiped like crazy and went through their potions within seconds - but ultimately this hurts the game - if you don't find somebody in your level range, you either reroll a character or play solo. Not optimal to say the least.\n\nI think I should also mention the humor, the ever talking spirits and your Seraphim guide Aria - well, they are beyond annoying at first. Once you get into the groove of the game and accept the fact that this is essentially a Saturday morning superhero cartoon show - it all becomes more bearable, dare I even say it, fitting? It is definitely not for people who believe Middle-Earth is a real place or that one guy who told the Blizzard people at some con there was something wrong with their lore cause in some novel on some page was something that contradicted something else that was said in the game. Sacred 3 knows that nobody gives a ♥♥♥♥ about high fantasy and runs with it. By being spewing nonstop nonsense at you, it even feels more honest than all those "serious" fantasy RPGs which are just as embarassing but don't want to admit it and hide behind silly names for people and places.\n\nAnyway, I highly doubt that with the response this game is getting anybody will fix the coop issues or tweak the game in other parts - which is a shame, since at the core this is a well crafted title that does a lot of the things it set out to do pretty well - I really hope that Sacred 4 will continue along this path and become a serious arcade-action game that entirely drops any resemblance of (A)RPG elements - I am pretty sure that Keen Games could do it!\n\nSacred 3, a bunch of friends and beer = good times.","August 3, 2014","true","27.7"," 23 of 95 people (24%) found this review helpful","24","23","95","0","5"

Очень неплохой hack-and-slash в стиле Диабло, но с сильным уклоном в сторону аркады. Аркадность игры компенсируется РПГ-элементами, однако без системы Диабло - то-есть теперь снаряжение открывается за уровни опыта, а берется за золото. Процесс уничтожения врагов не заставляет "сильно напрягатся" с одной стороны, а с другой - хотите серъёзней - ставьте уровень сложности повыше. Экипировка и умения дают возможность подобрать собственный стиль - здесь игра идеальна для всех игроков. Игра в ко-опе помогает немного быстрее набирать опыт и золото - здравствуй Диабло. В целом что сказать - здравствуй Sacred 3 после бездарного Sacred 2 - хорошо во всём - но...\nВо-первых почему нет звука в стартовой заставке? Во-вторых не совсем удачно подобраны реплики "духов оружия" - обещали нам что те расскажут историю Анкары, а на деле они просто фоновая озвучка игрового процесса. В третьих - графика: неплоха, но что-то маловато по сравнению с первым Sacred. В четвертых - камера иногда совершает повороты в связи со интро-сценами и в тот момент не очень удобно бежать, благо там нет врагов. И последнее - слишком много не нужной секс-тематики в репликах, слишком простенькая экипировка со старта и, самое плохое, консольность - хотя управление на ПК нормальное.\nВ целом - берите, но из ДЛС советую только доп. миссии - остальное позже.\n\nSo - lets start. Very good hack-and-slash Diablo style but with big shift to arcade. Arcade elements are compensaded with RPG-elements allow game to avoid catch-the-loot Diablo style - gear is opening for exp and equipping for gold. Process of cleaning mobs aren't difficult - but if you want challenge, just switch to higher difficulty - gear and skills allow any player mix their own combo - on that this game is ideal for any player. Co-op game allow to boost exp and gols - hello Diablo. In general what can i say - hello Sacred 3, after poor Sacred 2 - good in all, but...\nFirst - where is sound at the intro. Second - not quite good voice acting of spirits - devs promised that they will tell us story of Ancara, but they more "talk in action" when we killing mobs. Third - graphics - not bad, but that is all - compare with Sacred 1 it's moderate. Fourth - camera make some rotate in game intro-scenes, run at that moment isn't very comfortable but good that there are no enemies. And the last - too many intimacy at the voice-acting, too simple gear from beggining and the last and most worse - console-style - however on PC cointrols are normal.\nIn general - game is worth, but in DLC advise you to take only story expansion - rest later.","August 3, 2014","true","28.7"," 15 of 74 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","15","74","0","0"

You know, when I'm playing as an Undead, evil-aligned shadow warrior devoted to demonic worship.\n\nSacred 3 is all mindless brawl, choose 2 skills per level, choose from the weapons you've unlocked for that character with different bonuses like increased crit chance, chance to stun or just outright damage, I'm only level 5 on two characters so haven't unlocked armour upgrades for either yet, got a bunch of weapon spirits, some of which would only be useful to a team (-10% from health orbs for you, +10% for the team)\n\nI admit I pre-ordered off the back of Sacred 2, found out that it was all corridors, didn't cancel my pre-order anyway  and having enough fun rampaging.

Sacred 1 and 2 were giant games, with a huge open world and lots and lots of loot.\nThis game has none of that.\nIt's a pretty standard isometric top down view brawler in a fantasy setting. But does that make this game a bad game?\nWell if you bought it expecting the same kind of content as part 1 and 2 had, then you most likely will not like this game.\nHowever, if (like me) you've read the gaing news and previews and reviews about this game, you could have known exactly what it was. And im gonna say that, if you accept this game fro what it is. It's not bad, not at all. And actually very fun to play in co-op with some friends.\n\nIs it the same quality as sacred 1 and 2? no, not even close.

I'd say the mechanics are like you would mix these of Sacred and Devil May Cry.\nOverhead view mixed with mashing buttons to spam spells. You don't drop equipment like in any of this kind of game. You sometimes receive new weapon for you character after a mission. Also skill/spell gain is totally different. You don't drop skillstones as you would in previous games. You buy skills with gold. About gold, it's pretty much only thing you drop from enemies. Apart from green healing orbs and yellow 'mana' orbs. This is kinda similar to these from God of War games. With gold you upgrade your weapons and skills to have additional effects, so having less skills/equip in general is not that bad as you can 'evolve' them with coins. Combat is really action packed!

It is not an open world RPG with hundreds of different weapons and armors, the number of skills and things you can level up on your own is also limited.\n\nSo if you were looking for the old Sacred experience this is the point where you would like to leave.\n\nNow let us get to the part where we talk about what the game is.\n\n* It is hack'n'slay!\n* It is kind of like a sidescroller\n* It has 100s of mobs swarming around you waiting to be killed\n* It is a mission based game\n\nSo who would actually enjoy that kind of game? Well if you are the type who both enjoys the Devil May Cry series as well as Diablo then it might be the solid mix between the two that you MIGHT enjoy, especially when playing with friends.\n\nWhile i do enjoy it so far it is not what i expected but i remain neutral about it. As far as the price goes, if you have a lot of money to spend then sure why wouldn't you wanna buy the game if you are the type of person that would like it? However the game is not worth it's price and it is the only point that makes me sad  about it so far.\n\nIt's ok to go in a different way. It is ok to try something new. It is refreshing. In some way.\n\nNow it's up to you to pick a side.\n\nWill you leave having been looking for the old Sacred experience? Or will you appreciate the work that has been put into this game?\n\nI am a gamer and so i say that every game has one aspect or the other that one can enjoy if the game is actually really really bad which Sacred 3 is not.\n\nEdit: Final thoughts:\n\nThe game is not what Sacred used to be so the title Sacred 3 is missleading. Just a different project name would have saved the game from a lot of negative reaction. The game itself is not bad... Just overpriced... And different...\n\nAnd here some "TL;DRs"\nPlayer Case 1 (Old Schooler):\nYou are looking for the old Sacred experience? It is not here. Might as well leave.\n\nPlayer Case 2 (Open Minded yet a bit poor):\nYou still DO want the game but you do not have too much money to spend? I suggest waiting until a big sale bring it down by at LEAST 50% then it is worth the price.\n\nCase 3 (Open Minded... With money):\nYou have the money and you like the direction of the game despite the developers having moved away from what this game is? Take it.\n\nOh i also appreciate the developers having tried to introduce humor in the dialogues","July 31, 2014","true","5.9"," 110 of 439 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","110","439","0","9"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TiltingMills/recommended/247950/","TiltingMills","TiltingMills","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TiltingMills/","1355 products in account","Much like Dungeon Siege 3, Sacred 3 has little in common with its predecessors besides a name, setting and bright, colourful visuals. It's not so much an 'action RPG' as it is an 'arcade RPG' - more Gauntlet than Diablo. Pick one of four (five via preorder or DLC) pre-made hero/ines and get down to the business of clicking stuff until it dies.\n\nIn many ways, Sacred 3 has more in common with the download-only Sacred Citadel than its heavier RPG brothers - it's a button mashing brawler at heart, with linear levels and only as much level-up and customisation option as necessary to give the player some agency. Collectibles are limited to helth, energy and gold - the latter being used to buy upgrades or new skills when you level up.\n\nThere's no denying Sacred 3 won't be everyone's cup of tea - it is practically designed for couch co-op with friends and beers, or breezy online play while you and your mates mash buttons and talk trash. It has that quirky European sense of humour that made Sacred 2 surprisingly funny, although tempered by what the developers clearly think an American audience will find funny (and spoiler alert, you probably won't). That said, it has an awkward charm about it that'll either make you snicker, or at least roll your eyes with a smile.\n\nPerformance wise, the game runs flawlessly on my machine, the first $50+ game in quite a few months to do so (Wolfenstein, Watch Dogs I am looking at you). The visuals aren't amazing and shouldn't tax most systems, but the art style is big and colourful and mostly pleasing on the eye. Playing on my 46" TV it can be a bit hard to make out what is going on when there's a lot of enemies on the screen, but it's usually only a few seconds until everything is dead from one of your combat abilities.\n\nThe music is good and the voice acting is serviceable, although leaning towards the annoying end of the spectrum. There's a surprising amount of it too, with various 'souls' you can equip for a passive bonus, and each one has its own personality and one-liners. Word to the wise: the default guy you get is super annoying, so don't forget you can switch him out after a mission or two.\n\nAll in all, Sacred 3 is a competent hack & slash adventure, one best experienced with friends and in shorter sessions. It's far from perfect, and it's a departure from its predecessors, but with Divinity: Original Sin out there to get your more traditional RPG fix, this is the perfect antidote for when you just want to switch off your brain and bash some orcs.","August 1, 2014","true","3.4"," 19 of 145 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","19","145","0","0"

There is no open world here, there isn't real loot you'll find dropping from your enemies, just gold, health globes and energy globes.\n\nThe story seems silly and from the start it's apparent that the game doesn't take itself seriously at all, beginning from the narrator, continuing to what the NPCs say including even your own character and the Souls attached to your weapons.\n\nYou play in confined levels that can be pretty short or somewhat long that you pick from a map, after which you get dropped into the level and that you'll navigate until the boss fight at the end, after which you'll leave.\n\nAfter certain fights (usually Bosses that I've seen) you'll find new Souls for your weapon, as well as new weapons that you'll be able to use (and upgrade if you are high level enough and have enough gold) after completing the mission.\n\nThe action is pretty hectic, with enemies attacking in droves while the player has to try and dodge out of the way of powerful attacks, break the shield of bigger enemies to be able to hurt them or stop certain enemies from casting (or interrupt althogether their spell) all the while managing the use of skills that use a limited energy resource.\n\nPersonally, I wanted this to be closer to the old games, something more akin to Sacred 2 but, so far, I have been having fun with what this game has to offer. The action can get very busy and even at the normal level of difficulty I found that dying can become rather easy if not paying attention at getting out of the way. Killing the groups of enemies coming at you and emerging victorious is also another fun aspect of the game.\n\nThe commands are responsive, the game looks quite nice and performs really well even when downsampling from something like 2880x1620.\nI have found a problem with the game crashing whenever I open the friend menu in game but I'm not sure if that's the game or something on my PC.\n\nAll in all, the experience with the game so far is really positive. Probably not an experience worth 50€, but I didn't pay that much for it when I preordered, so it's more of a problem for anyone that would want to grab the game now.","August 1, 2014","true","16.4"," 32 of 194 people (16%) found this review helpful","16","32","194","0","0"

Sacred 3 brings all of the wit and humour of Sacred Citadel to a faster, more arcade feeling gaming experience with engaging story, interesting characters and completely functional, highly competitive 4 player co-op. Though, the price point may be a little high for the content.\n\nThe loot is all but gone from this game, staying true to the arcade feel. Instead you are awarded weapons and weapon upgrades, items, item slots and armor upgrades by completing story and side missions. The weapon and armor upgrades are given to you in a cycle through completing story missions; Weapon 1, Weapon 2, Weapon 3, Armour. Start again with the next four story missions. You progress through these missions through a hub-based world map guided by the Seraphim Aria, and each node on the map can take between 2 and 20 minutes to complete. These range from clearing out a single pathway, surviving 5 waves of enemies to sieging a fortress.  You can visit any node on the map at any time, in any order and however many times you wish, though the final encounter only unlocks after all other story missions have been cleared. A single clear through the map will take you roughly 8 playing hours, 10 for the second. The replayability comes from multiple characters, chasing high scores and playing with your friends.\n\nAs you traverse each map node, of which there are 40, the telepathic Seraphim Aria will attempt to guide you. She is only a novice, so don't be too hard on her! She will give you helpful pointers for where to go and roughly what to do, though it is worth mentioning that if you ignore her suggestions, she will harass you until you do it which can become a little bit annoying at times.\n\nThe game's difficulty settings ARE actually what they say they are. Knight (Easy) is mindnumbingly easy for a skilled player. You should be in absolutely no danger on this mode, even if you've never played a video game of any kind before. Champion (Medium) is a little more difficult, but nothing short of bosses should give you any trouble. Legend (Hard) is the first difficulty in which health potions should even be needed. You definitely don't want to look away from a fight here! Once you have completed the map on Knight, Champion or Legend, Deity (Impossible) becomes available. Deity increases the suggested level and difficulty of each node on the map, and will be very difficult if attempted without at least one other party member, and it is here that the co-op multiplayer really shines.\n\nThe co-op multiplayer is entirely optional, however. Drop in/drop out co-op can be disabled by setting your play session to 'private' if you're more the single player type. You will not be forced to play with any AI companions for doing this either. If you'd rather not have the Online feature at all, Sacred 3 does have an offline mode. Should you choose to partake in the co-op multiplayer, you will be in the same playspace as between 1 and 3 other players. You will work together to clear the map in a strange but kind of fun blend of cooperation and oneupmanship. Exactly how points are awarded is unclear at this point. Simply killing more enemies than your cooperators is not enough to come out with the high score. HOW you kill them matters too. If one of your party members falls in battle, reviving them will also score you some points.\n\nThe combat is fast and functional, with new combat arts for each of the four new classes and the returning Seraphim to use, as well as weapon spirits and three weapons each. Each weapon has it's own unique specialty to suit your playstyle. Do you like to keep enemies on their back? Plough through them with brutal force? Dance around the battlefield? It's up to you! Though it is worth nothing that some features/actions are shared between the five classes, so to a certain degree once you have played one it will be very easy to get into another one, and after a while the cycle of dodge and attack starts to feel samey.\n\nWeapon spirits are shards that you collect at random throughout Ancaria, each with it's own personality and modifier for your abilities, ranging from lifesteal, party buffs, shielding, damage reduction, enemy debuffing and more. The spirits have voices, and speak to you as well as your party. This companionship between weapon and wielder adds quite a bit of fun to the game, as the running commentary brings out a lot of laughs. You level them up by finding more shards, boosting their power and thusly, the effect they pass on to you.\n\nEvery aspect of your character (with the exception of weapon spirits) are upgradeable using gold found throughout the game. Once you have reached the level requirement to be elligible for the upgrade, you can buy it with gold to boost or change the function of your weapons, armor, combat arts, as well as to buy consumables. There is plenty of gold to be found in the game, so you will usually have more gold than upgrades to spend it on, taking the grind out of the equation.\n\nThe enemies vary in strength and skills as the game progresses, though they seem to share some abilities from level 1 and on, only adding either extra abilities or extra effects to make them more dangerous, though there is very little variety in the enemies themselves. Most of the bosses feel bossy, but these can be usually be navigated simply by dodging away when they attack and not standing in the goo. Only a handful of the bosses have any mechanics that make fighting them different from any other. The game does start to feel samey in this regard.\n\nThe game has full mouse, keyboard and gamepad support as well as built-in voice communication service. However it is readily apparent that this is a console port as it feels way more natural to play the game with a gamepad. The default keyboard and mouse settings feel somewhat obtuse. Though you are able to map the keyboard and mouse as well as the gamepad to your preference, so with some tweaking the game is very playable with either.\n\nThe visuals, special effects, voice acting and optimisation are phenominal. The game is pure beauty, with amazing environments, smooth camera angles and lively and vibrant voice acting.\n\nAll told Sacred 3 and it's prequel, Sacred Citadel are GREAT games, and I recommend that any isometric RPG or arcade brawler fan play them. However it is my personal hope that Sacred 4, should there be one, return to the loot-crazed, open worlded and more serious toned Sacred and Sacred 2: Fallen Angel crafted by Ascaron. There are only two jokers in a deck. Deep Silver has played both.\n\n\nNotable bugs/issues(PC):\n-The game is 20GB for no apparent reason.\n-The game does not remember your resolution setting from one session to the next\n-The game locks up without warning and without reason from time to time\n-Crash to desktop\n-Sometimes can't equip certain weapons for no apparent reason\n-Steam overlay sometimes sticks to the edges of the screen in-game.","July 31, 2014","true","14.6"," 30 of 193 people (16%) found this review helpful","16","30","193","0","0"

There's no menus to wade through or complexity of character progression which means players who thirst for killing can do so without hindrance.  In this regard the game succeeds, but at the same time does become repetitive quite quickly unless you're well in tune with levelling up your character, or willing to try the others classes to add some variety. As mentioned, if you're a fan of the previous games that afford more depth and exploration, then you're going to probably feel a little let down with what's on offer here as the game is Sacred by name, but certainly not in execution.\n\nScore 7/10 - Review By  Robert Cram","July 31, 2014","true","29.1"," 29 of 190 people (15%) found this review helpful","15","29","190","0","1"

Sacred 1 and 2 were open world games RPG games. Sacred 3 however breaks with the previous iterations and aims for a more console like gameplay. A similar thing happend with Dungeon Siege III. The game is situated in the same world as before, but that is where all comparisons end. Really.\n\nSacred 3 is a extremely linear, controller-friendly hack-and-slash game, with virtually no RPG elements. It looks pretty, the sound is ok albeit that the comments and voices are very cheesy and becomes annoying soon. Always a lot is happening on the screen so it get's kinda messy sometimes. But that's ok, just hack and hope to survive. With this game and mechanics, you either like it or you don't. I kinda like this game for what it is. Only if you could shut up that woman...\n\nOne very, very annoying thing is that it doesn't have a pause function. This is really lame so you have to complete the mission or find a safe spot.\n\nSo if you are looking for a open-world, customizations, character-building rpg \ hack-and-slash game, look further. This is definitely nothing for you. If you want to have a nice couch game with scarce dressed women, lots of actions and easy drop-in\drop-out give this a try.\n\nPlayed it single player.","August 1, 2014","true","5.2"," 28 of 187 people (15%) found this review helpful","15","28","187","0","1"

It is a very nice try to make a "dataless" ARPG. You don't need to worry about your DPS,you HP, your armor..your strength..your AGI..your INT.....your..your...and you don't need to loot the legendary. Quite a new experience for ARPG. And also the stunning graphic. Like it so far.

Not really a game for serious and dedicated gamer. but if you are looking for a fun game for time killing then this is the game...if it is labelled as a free to play , thats it. the price just doesnt worth the content in the game.","January 12, 2015","false","13.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you have played Sacred 1 and 2 and you enjoyed the open world, the loot drops and that you can make your own combo attacks, then you should never ever in your entire life, not for a split second even consider of buying this.....abomination.....of the Sacred series..... The open world isn't there, not even in the slightest form....if you completed a section of a level, a wall of force is created behind you so you must keep going. The only adjustments you can make to your character are so limited that you think: Well this is a waste of time.\n\nI cannot image who in the whole multiverse would ever has the opinion that this game, is a great game. This game is so bad that not even in the alternative version of our world anyone would think this is a great game. I played it for 3 hours to get a good opinion of this game and i regret the day I was thinking: Well maybe I might enjoy this game. I regret the money I used to buy this game, would have prefered to give it to some drug addicts, atleast they would buy drugs and feel happy for a few hours and I regret to have spend 3.3 hours into this game cause I could have hit my head against a brick wall and experience more positive feeling while doing that..........\n\nIf you still buy this game now........ Imagine the next situation: Your chained to a bomb. Infront of you is a computer, the main screen of Sacred 3 is shown, next to the computer is a timer and a television screen. As the screen turns on you see the puppet of the Saw series: Hello [insert name]. I want to play a game. You decided to buy Sacred 3 and now you must free yourself from the thoughts of enjoyment given by this game. You as sitting on a bomb which will explode in 6 hours unless you manage to really enjoy this game for atleast 4 hours. Next to the timer is a happiness-meter. If the meter goes into the :-| face it won't count towards the 4 hours of enjoyment. Live or Die. You decide.\n\nYou are screwed.........

Like really really bad. I was huge fan of Sacred 2 but this is just piece of you know what. I don’t even know why do they call it RPG, since it has almost nothing to do with this game genre. No open world, no loot, almost no character development, no NPC dialogues, nothing. You have just linear missions with just one corridor from start to finish, few minibosses on the path and hundreds of mobs that are eager to die. And whole time you have to listen to crappy jokes, probably to make you uninstall this game faster. Some may say that it’s what hack’n’slash games look like but this is poor performance even for them. So unless they give it for free (and even then I would think twice before installing it) don’t bother with buying it, it’s just waste of money and time.","May 25","false","1.0"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
