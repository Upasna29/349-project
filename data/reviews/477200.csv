It\'s a realy good board game (yes, these are still around and a thing) from FFG and is pretty good.\n\nIf you own the game this app is a fun new way to play Descent 2nd Edition so go and try it out... if you don\'t own it, look some YouTube videos up and descide if you want to own it... you could even play it alone with this app.\n\nThough in my opinion playing the classic game variant with up to 5 Players is more fun. (Maybe because I love to play as the Overlord against 4 Heros... and the app simply doesn\'t let you play as the OL) ^^","June 1","true","2.0"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

If you own a copy of the board game, I recommend you try out this Road to Legend app.","June 1","true","0.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It is a new way to play that fans have been asking for for years and finally we can do it. Yes you can even play solo, it's great. I am looking forward to the future of this companion app, hopefully many new campaigns will be released for it. Also It would be awesome if FFG would suport fan made campaigns for this app via the Steam Workshop. Think of the possibilities!","June 1","true","0.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

There's a ton of heroes and monster not supported only due to this :/\n\nOther than that, this application looks gorgeous and really amazing. I can't wait to actually try and start that campaign. And it's free, so even better.","June 2","true","3.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Everyone got to play a character with the PC taking role of Overlord. Used a Disciple Healer, a Mage Runemaster, and a Warrior Marshall with all expansion packs excluding Mists of Bilehall. Intro quest was fun with a couple of surprises, plenty of xp and gold for first city visit. Next side quest we got hammered as Skarn showed up blocking our way to alter and peril darkness just wore us down. Final goblin camp quest was going great, including the Healer taking down a Giant solo while separated from the party. Eventually overwhelmed by random monster spawns. Probably would have been wise to avoid side quest. Great RPG feel to game when app is used. Looking forward to seeing the next campaign release. App stated that it did not recognize conversion kit, but we indicated that we had 2nd edition supplemental monster sets and encountered no problems.","June 5","true","14.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

We have a descent 2 in our group for a long time yet we were finished with him and not played him utnil tommorow. First of all, this app makes Descent a fully cooperative game and to be honest a one, that we definelty wants to play again.\n\nRule book is needed with this app. At least for a terms like engage or spot and i dont understand, why is not built in into this app already (you need to download PDF) and also we have to turn off the music. The loop is little bit short and after a while, its poisoning the atmosphere (here you go our RPG music folder).\n\nOver and all, this app is cool and let us enjoy Descent in a completly different way. Looking forward for next campaing!!!","June 4","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
