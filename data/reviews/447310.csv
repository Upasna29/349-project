This time memes turned into something more serious, trains!\n\nWhole gameplay is based on right timing for every situation - you are in control of traffic lights and rail-switches, and your task is to keep the railroad going without any crash. It might sound easy, but the levels push you with higher difficulty to need for getting more and more patient.\n\nWhat's worth mentioning is the fact that remembering the train sequences for repeating of levels won't help you - the number of wagons for trains is randomly generated, so after every restart you have to patiently check how many wagons trains on the railroad has (and how fast they are). Prepare for often crashes and keeping determination, as the game can make you tilt pretty easily.\n\nVisuals of this game are really nice, the pen and paper style looks great! Every level looks and feels different (and there are 300 levels!), that shows up the great work developers made.\n\nBut let's mention also the cons - I can't get rid of the feeling that the smartphone version was made by a full team with proper graphics designer, but the PC version required a new menu and popup windows, which in the end look like to be done in a rush by a programmer who done the port. It looks ugly, with regular font you might use in a document and without any thought of style worthy the pen and paper in-game visuals. It's no wonder that the menu and popups are nowhere to be seen in trailer and screenshots. Also, the game's text would deserve a proofread for few small mistakes.\n\nConclusion:Paper Train Traffic is a nice game for 4 euros, considering the drawn graphics style and big amount of content that can provide you hours of fun... or frustration, it depends on your patience and acceptance of challenges.\n\n\nDisclaimer: My copy of Paper Train Traffic was obtained for free for reviewing purposes. This fact hasn't changed my opinion about the game (and the review) in any way.\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","March 5","true","5.3"," 30 of 34 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","30","34","2","0"

I do not hesitate to call the overall design and concept "brilliant", and far exceeding the average.\n\nPaper Train: Traffic is a very special game. Special in its simplicity, in its design and concept, in its wonderful anything-but-simply graphics (though simple to understand), and special in the joy of playing such a FUN game. (Oh, yes, VERY special in its wonderfully low price.)\n\nThe premise to Paper Train: Traffic is nothing new, so the learning curve isn't even an issue (except for helping to develop skills.) You have a number of trains crossing the screen. Pretty much all the player can do is stop, then start traffic on specific tracks to avoid collisions (which are quite fun, and not necessarily rage-inducing), or switch tracks on some levels. (Perhaps other things later on.) There are variables to consider, such as trains are of different lengths and travel at varying speeds, f'rinstance. (And did I mention that the trains aren't always the same in every attempt.....) Some of the tracks are very convoluted, and involve many crossings. You are also able to "boost" the speed of the entire screen in order to increase points generated, but then aren't close to the "stop/start" buttons. Any collisions results in a "Retry", while a level completion results in a grade of 1 - 3 stars. As in most games of this type, cummulative star count opens features, and each of 300(!!!) levels must be accessed through completion of prior levels. There is also at least one leaderboard with the option to compare to friends only (and perhaps other choices.)\n\nI haven't played Paper Train: Traffic very long, but I really don't need to to recommend it at this price. My suggestion? Buy it, play it, decide for yourself within the "refund" period. I suspect there will be few refunds requested.\n\n(Hopefully more as I have more to report.)\n\nThank you.","March 5","true","20.3"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","19","20","0","4"

At first impressions, the game is fun and enjoyable to play and the crashes are hilarious for a while, but then that is where the positive part of this game ends. As after that point this game becomes more of a frustrating chore than a fun game for the casual gamer. I don't care if this review gets voted down as the truth is not always nice. If you have a high tolerence of patience, then sure buy the game. But for the casual gamer, I would recommend something less frustrating. A difficulty mode would have been nice :).\n\nOverall Rating: 3/10.","May 25","false","2.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

However, running the trains at high speed to get more points and stars can be incredibly challenging in the time given.  With that said, this game is very fun, and I have nothing negative to write about it.  The game is simple, challenging, and addictive.  Highly recommended...","March 10","true","50.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It has nice graphics. The music is OK.\nBut, and that's my reason for not recommending it, it is really frustrating, especially if you aim for 3 stars. Sometimes the trains appear in a way a solution is not possible, sometimes you are just not fast enough for handling signals that are some way apart. In these cases you have to train a bit to utilize the boost to the best advantage, i.e. stop using it in the right moment.\nIf you have a high frustation level, go ahead, it's a good game then.","March 22","false","13.4"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","1","5","0","0"

The paper/pencil graphics are beautiful and the game is a joy to play. Even when you fail a level the frustration is eased by the resultant train crash.\n\nI've finished all the levels (300) in about 18 hours. But the addiction is there just to keep going back and replay the levels for those extra points, and just for the joy of the gameplay.\n\nAt this price I can only recommend you give it a try. The graphics are worthy of any full price game and the gameplay is a joy.","April 18","true","29.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
