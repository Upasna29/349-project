"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jigstraw/recommended/274900/","Jigstraw","Jigstraw","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jigstraw/","175 products in account","First and foremost, I have to say that if you are good at FPS games, you will be seeing a whole lot of this. http://puu.sh/j0pPW/47dd0db054.jpg\n\nDon't write this off as some minecraft spin-off. I'd say it's 5% minecraft, 95% Halo. Like I know a lot of people have probably said, it uses block-based maps, and if the host doesn't disable it, you can place and destroy blocks. But a large majority of the time, that's not the focus of the gameplay in the very least. It can be a pretty competitive FPS. Or it can just be a casual game to play with friends, if you're not the competitive type. There's your standard team death match mode, free for all, and capture the flag, which are the competitive modes. And then there's the more laid-back, casual modes in Zombie Survival and Infection. In Infection, all players start out as humans, with one randomly selected player as a zombie. If the zombie kills you, you respawn as a zombie, and the game is over when all the humans are dead. The winner is the player with the most kills. I don't really like it, because it seems like a boring camp-fest, and there's always that one guy that just digs a hole and hides with a shotgun. But overall, this game is really fun. If you like Halo, you'll like this.\n\nThe weapons are pretty standard. The sniper, battle rifle, pistol, shotgun, and machine gun are all straight out of Halo. There's also the energy sword, but it works a little differently in this. It doesn't instantly lunge and one-hit-kill like the Halo sword does, but instead has to be charged for 2-3 seconds. Or you can use two weak sword attacks instead. Then there's the hookshot. Basically, it's a grappling hook straight out of batman. Or the hookshot from Legend of Zelda, if you like. Then you've got your frag grenades, which can't kill a full health/shield player, and your plasma grenades, which only kill if you actually stick a player. Everything is pretty well-balanced overall.\n\nIn addition to standard fire modes, all weapons have a secondary function or alternate fire mode. The sniper/pistol/battle rifle have scopes. The shotgun camouflages you as the same kind of blocks surrounding you, and the machine gun empties the remainder of its clip at double the normal fire rate. The sword and hookshot don't have alternate fire modes.\n\nThen, there's the miner gun. It can break single blocks, a 1x3 grid of blocks, or a 3x3 grid of blocks at a time. It also has a "Blaster" mode that requires time to charge, but releases a slow-moving explosive projectile. It can also be changed to "building" mode and used to place blocks, for mapmaking purposes, or building cover to hide behind.\n\nAnyway, there's a lot of different things you can do in this game, and for $1.99, it's an investment you probably won't regret. If this sounds like something that would interest you, don't second-guess yourself. Buy it and come play with the rest of the community!\n\nEdit/update: I'd like to also say that the casual/average community on this game is absolutely terrible. If you're a person that ragequits or boots anyone playing better than you, don't buy this game, we don't want you playing it. I'm tired of getting booted from matches when I do well, as well as hosts that end the session after getting stomped for one match. I don't ALWAYS get booted, because there are a few people that don't care if they win or lose and respect skilled players, but by large, most of the community doesn't want to play unless everyone else they're playing with sucks, and that is a very bad way to approach any game. It's very common in this game for even just moderately good players to be accused of hacking and immediately booted from the lobby.\n\nThe game is also not a polished masterpiece. There are bugs and glitches as with any game, especially indie games. But this game has very solid gameplay, a lot of variety, and it's a diamond in the rough. The sequel is hopefully going to be better when it's finally released, as it's going to have matchmaking on dedicated servers instead of user-made locally hosted lobbies, so lag will (hopefully) be less of an issue.\n\nBut if you enjoy this game, and you happen to have a spare computer and a reasonably good internet connection, add me on steam! On the murderminers.com forums, we got someone to write a script that automatically runs a lobby on its own and changes the map on its own, we just need people with the resources to run them constantly, and that would improve most players' experience with the game tremendously, as a lot of people's only complaints relate to having high ping/bad connection to the player hosting the game.","November 18, 2014","true","697.1"," 169 of 188 people (90%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","90","169","188","27","13"

First off, what you need to know is that this game is a multiplayer FPS. It's not a "mining" or "survival sandbox" game by any means. You're shooting other players in a competitive enviornment. The only similarity this game has to minecraft (and I honestly dislike that it  can even be compared to minecraft) is that you build the maps with blocks. That's it. Secondly, you need to know that this game moves and shoots exactly like a Halo game, with the exception that you can do some wall kicks and other moves like that.  If there were one game to compare it to, it'd be Halo. Definitely not Minecraft. Anyways, the last thing you should know is that this game still needs more polish in the graphics and presentation departments. Some of the textures aren't that great, there's no lighting to speak of, and the menus are pretty bland. However, I was able to overlook those shortcomings when I experienced how well the game plays. You'll probably be able to do the same! I'd be sure to hop on this game quickly, because Jforce plans to add a lot to it. These devs have a lot of good ideas for the game. Well, that's all I've got.","July 25, 2014","true","14.5"," 114 of 144 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","114","144","0","0"

Trust me, I was too. However, hidden underneath the minecraft graphics and halo character models, is actually a very solid, addicting, fun FPS. The gunplay and movement are fairly similar to halo, but with the addition of a mining gun (can place/destroy blocks), and a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ grappling hook (like in just cause 2). Mix in a gigantic map selection and some hilarious potential game settings (turbo fire alone is rib-crushingly funny for a good 20 minutes), and you have a game that's worth FAR more than the 2 dollar price tag.\nThe only major downside I would like to point out is the lack of players online at off-peak times. Only a couple of games will be up at a time if you aren't playing during the evening on a weekend. Would recommend getting a couple of friends to buy, or gifting a 4-pack to them.\nSpread the word!

Lets just say its worth every penny.\n\nREVIEW:\n\nMurder Miners. Originally launched back on the Xbox Live Indie Marketplace in 2012, this title takes the best aspects of the FPS Halo (In particular, Halo: Combat Evolved) and shoves it into a Voxel Battleground, reminiscent of Minecraft.\n\nThe game just got out of a closed beta, and in it's current state is pretty much the ultimate edition of the game. For $5 (Currently $4) you get access to hundreds of maps pre-made by JForce and the community, with plenty of your favorites (I'm talking maps like Blood Gulch, pretty much every Halo map, and even Unreal Tournament 2004 maps). You do have the ability to make your own maps, with a pretty in depth map editor comapred to other titles in the genre.\n\nGameplay is where Murder Miners shines. The developers have fine tuned this monster to Quake 3 levels of responsiveness, leaving you with tight, fast controls. Of course, you can always lower it to suit your playstyle; Want to play like your playing Halo? Drop it down to 4. Minecraft? 3. The gunplay is great. You'll have access to 6 weapons; A Halo Battle Rifle, 3 Shot Magnum, Sniper, Energy Sword (Looks like a medieval sword), Shotgun, Machine Gun, and a Hookshot (Grappling hook). These pretty much play like you'd expect them to, and you end up with some sweet â¥â¥â¥ montage clips when using the grapple hook.\n\nThe game isn't all running around though. Take to the skies in a Helicopter style vehicle and reign death from above with heavy missles. Take 2 friends up with you to give some additional firepower from above. Or perhaps you're after a burst of speed? No problem, grab a hoverbike and get to work.\n\nOne of the BEST features of Murder Miners is the Infection Game Mode. Zombies versus Humans. The maps that you get default with this game for Infection are awesomely amazing, such as burnt out cities, military bases, all giving that erry vibe that an enemy isn't too far away. 30 people in an infection game on a big map equals lots o' fun. Plus, if you're a lonely person, you can have zombie AI bots! There's fun for everyone here!\n\nThe amount of possibilities in Murder Miners are pretty much endless, and if you're a fan of Halo you'll be drooling from nostalgia after playing this.","July 22, 2014","true","886.2"," 95 of 126 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","95","126","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Wubbadu/recommended/274900/","Wubbadu","Wubbadu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Wubbadu/","64 products in account","Ah, Murder Miners. This is a very weird game for me. This game came from the harrowing depths of the Xbox Indie Games marketplace *shudders*, which is basically the place on xbox live where all the 11 year olds who just discovered programming and learnt 6 days worth of stuff dump their â¥â¥â¥â¥ that they put together in about 3 days, and normally using the stupid avatars that you make, all the while making a completely different art style than the avatars, resulting in an inconsistant, uninnovative terrible rip off of some big name game that trends over all of youtube, and gives these little 11 year old's a boner for "creativity" and "inspiration" for their newly found "skill" in programming. This might sound like an exaggeration. It's not a joke. And thats the saddest part. Just open the most popular page. What do we find in the top 100? COD Rippoffs, Japanese Dating Sims by a boy who just discovered that girl's butts and boobs can arouse an e rrection, and now jacks off to Hentai porn, thinking that there will be lots more in the same situation, which there are apperantly due to the ammount of downloads this stuff gets ,Five night's at Freddy's ripoffs, Halo ripoffs, hunger games ripoffs, Slender ripoffs, and the HOLY GRAIL OF THE INDIE GAME MARKETPLACE, MINECRAFT RIPOFFS. Castle miner, Castle miner Z, Fortress Craft, Total Miner, Castle miner warfare, just to name like 0.3 percent of the minecraft ripoffs on this place. There's an f'n DayZ ripoff, for crying out loud, that is easily one of my top 5 worst games of all time. I occasionally look through here every year or so for about 15 minutes, which is all I need, to see if there is anything, just   ANYTHING that can be even SLIGHTLY good, or fun, or have ANY redeeming factor, that cannot be used as a torture tool used by the CIA. And every year, I came back to my bed in defeat. Then one day, I found it. The very first indie game that was at all good. 2012. Murder Miners. The shining light of hope in a place of despair. The angel of hell itself. The Rocky of gaming.The Half Life of the cramped first person shooter genre. The one game that was different. The game that had promise. That had a future. Of all the little â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ that stood on a mountain, that had been discovered and cramped for centuries, that had a mountain on the other side, this was the one that finally decided, "You know what? I'm gonna jump to that other mountain. Screw these other chickens. I will be the one to make the jump, and discover new land, and save this mountain from its innevitable starvation. And it jumped. It finally jumped. And when it jumped, everything went in slow motion. Every couple of milliseconds of the short time that it was in the air, it made a few tweaks to its form and execution of this graceful jump. And everyone else on this mountain came up and watched. They all just stood there, and watched. They didn't do anything to help, not one even tried. They just watched as this beautiful object jumped. And then Murder Miners blinked for one second. One. Little did Murder Miners know, that this would be the last glimpse at life her would see. And she never opened his eyes again. She didn't make the jump. All because she closed her eyes for one brief second during her jump, to take in everything she had done during this jump. She just stopped making tweaks, and just took in everything she had done. It wasn't much, but she just thought it was enough, and continued with her jump, just taking it in for a bit. But then she bumped her head on the cliff, and fell into the spikes 7000 feet below her, with no chance of her ever coming back to life, brutally damaged beyond repair. Even if she could get back up, and revive herself, everybody stopped watching, and still, didn't even try to help, or even continue what she started, and this glimmer of hope was killed off more quickly than it had been born. Her parents tried desperately to make another child, that hopefully could successfully make this jump, and as we speak, this child is being made, but for now, there is no light in this terrible, miserable, absolutely horrible, helpless place of agony and dispair.\n\nThat is the story of the xbox live indie marketplace, Murder Miners' ascension and descent in quality, popularity, and general hope for the hopeless future of the marketplace. If you want an actual review, Murder Miners is a Halo inspired Online FPS, with the ability to destroy and place blocks, like in Minecraft. I know, at first glance, it looks like any old game on the marketplace that tries to combine shooting with minecraft, but its not. Really. I'd say its about 95% Halo and 5% Minecraft. In fact, if this was done with AAA production values, was refined, popular, and generally more playable, and improved upon, I'd say this has the potential to be better than Halo. Thats how much promise this game showed(notice how I used past tense.). And that is saying a lot, considering Halo 3 is my second favorite FPS ever. There are quite a few additions to this game that would feel right at home in a Halo game. Walljumping, check. Destructible Enviorments, check. Custom maps, double check. But in its current state, the game is just ultimately dissapointing. There are 2 main problems with this game, 1 of which is only on PC. The game simply does not have enough players. During late Friday nights and stuff, on PC and xbox, this game has on average MAYBE 4 or 5 games going on, and the ones I have experienced so far on PC all have turbo firing or some â¥â¥â¥â¥ enabled that has time to kill that would make Modern Warfare 2 blush. If you are reading this right now, PLEASE buy this game. Please. This game desperately needs players, and 20 max players playing at once is just not acceptable. At least have the game, so that you can possibly get more people to play. Seriously. It's $4 for a four pack. Buy the four pack, and give some copies to friends. Come on. It is only $4. I bet you anything your CSGO inventory is probably worth more. Just if you can, try to get more people playing. The more people the better. And 2, this is a horrible PC port. JForce(the developers) have gone back and added a very few more options, but it is still not enough for a pc version. This game doesn't even have resolution options, which is just plain unacceptable for a 3D game. And you will probably have better performance, because I have a TERRIBLE computer. I mean, I'm talking a CSGO 5v5 on low settings at 800x600 only getting about 20-55 fps. But seriously, this game at times, especially when looking at open areas, just as huge frame drops, that are really rather sudden, and often times don't make sense, like looking at a big open space occasionally netting more fps than a wall. It still runs alright, but there is really only an option for ansitropic filtering and AA, that is combined into one setting, and windowed mode, and fog distance, but that is about it. I mean, Wolfenstein The New Order has more options, and I consider that a pretty bad options menu. This is just a whole 'nother level of terrible porting.\nOverall, you have a soild game that certaintly isn't near perfect, not in the slightest bit, but still solid, and dirt cheap, that needs more players. Currently JForce is working on a new game called Murder Miners X, which is a sequel to this. Many people are upset that they are pretty much just ditching this game, and that does kinda suck, but it makes sense. This is exactly what JForce needs. A fresh start. And, the plan is to expand onto multi-platform, and this should heavily increase the initial popularity, and hopefully, long term popularity of the game, as it won't be buried under the indie games section. Buy this game now.\n\nJUST DO IT.","September 4, 2015","true","3.5"," 101 of 147 people (69%) found this review helpful 51 people found this review funny","69","101","147","51","5"

Unfortunately, I would ONLY recommend it if you can play with friends.\n\n+Yes, its Minecraft-like aestetic, but nobody said you cant do it.

I really did. My friends and I got the four pack and we liked the game at first. The combat was simple but the more skilled weapons had a higher skill cap than most people expected. While my friends soon lost interest in the style of the game, I kept playing. I kept playing this game through it's peak. I remember back when to be considered good you actually had to know  how to reliably use parkour moves. But the golden ages are FAR gone. Idk really what started it, I remember the game picked up alot of trolls, but if you play any game long enough you'll make friends and enemies so I ignored it, even when others didn't. But despite the fact that myself and a few loyalists kept playing, and well the servers kept getting smaller and smaller until it just wasn't fun anymore. The game wasn't fun back than for the same reason it isn't fun now. Murder Miners doesn't have many game modes, or many public servers which really gimps it's already limited play style. Further more if you do find a server it's hard to play seriously. I played in a few servers today before posting this review (i went through about 6 hosts in an hour) alot of them would end the game early, most of the time to disband the server. Because I (not to try and sound douchey) dominated the competion. It isn't fair to put new players at this game in a match with somebody who's played it for hours (i think my hours must have been reset, any of my friends can tell you I've played way more). I mean this game does want a pro-face right? At one point a player that i recognized from the past came on for 1... count it 1 game. I'll admit when the person came on for that game it was super fun. Sadly because of how the community is now we didn't even get to finish. When he was at 47/50 kills and I was at 45/50 (the next player had less than 25 I wasn't really watching him). the host ended the game early. Normally I would have been mad... but when you play this game, expect hosts to BM if you start beating them.","April 30","false","86.5"," 40 of 50 people (80%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","80","40","50","6","10"

The gunplay feels like an updated Halo CE with the addition of optional swords, mining/building guns, and grappling hooks. There is a huge variety of levels in the game by default but players may choose to create their own maps, and many popular community maps have been imported over from the Xbox 360 version of the game so you will have no trouble finding remakes and tributes to your favourite games, along with creative maps that take advantage of the customiseable game modes such as parkour and chase maps.\n\nWhether you are a casual player looking for something to not take seriously, a competitive player, or just someone looking for a good co-operative experience with friends, this game is perfect for you.

Most people will take one look at this game called "Murder Miners" and rightfully pass right over it because what, do we need another fortresscraft/minecraftclone? I implore you not to judge this game by its title or by its crafty appearance. To do so would be to deny yourself something simple and fun.\n\nThe reason this title is so cheap is not because it tries to emulate Minecraft. In fact, other than borrowing the ever-trending concept of blocks as landscape, it takes absolutely nothing else from the aforementioned survival block games. Murder Miners takes the best of the shooting genre and combines it with blocks. Its all about the fundamentals: Shooting and building.\n\nLets talk about shooting.\nThe online play is almost exclusively "guns only" meaning you won't find many people hosting a public map building session (but thats not to say you won't see them). Most servers will cater to their lobby, asking what maps they like, and what game modes.\n\nThe guns feel light and maneuverable. In short the games FPS mechanics just feel tight and classic. They offer all the weapons any decent shooter would offer, and they are simple in appearance and function. You get your Halo CE with a little bit of old timey arena shooter, and it feels great. Alot of people will say how fun the Infection mode is, and it truly is. But this isn't why the game shines the brightest in my opinion.\nThe thing that makes this shooter stand out from others is the "back-to-basics" mechanics that run through the whole game. It doesn't have time for the weapon attachments, the unnecessary game modes, and the hype surrounding the popular shooters of today. J force instead boils it all down to the raw, uncensored arena FPS.\n\nThe mobility offered to the player is only expanded by the use of blocks. Players can use steps of blocks (much like Faith uses steps in Mirrors Edge) to "vault" by double tapping space. This not only works with steps; any vertical surface can be jumped off of as long as you are gaining altitude, providing endless opportunities to assault your opponents.\n\nThe building is all done from a mining gun with a built-in block selection interface. You can spawn different types of blocks by selecting them with the arrow keys, and you can place them in four different ways (Line, face, float and fill). The build mechanics are primitive, but there is SO much you can do with primitive. The more fundamental the mechanics are, the more possibilities exist. One look at the workshop is enough to prove that.\n\nAll in all, the game plays very well, despite the low production value (which will show, believe me). If you like getting your guns on, but have a mind for creativity as well, this game is a great option, and the price of $1.99 is pretty attractive too.","July 26, 2014","true","228.6"," 24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","24","29","0","1"

Murder Miners has the same gun play as Halo:CE while adding its own unique twist. Wall-bouncing makes the maps more flexible and more easy to get around. And adding totally customizable destruction (to what map creators want). This game is entirely Multiplayer. Team Deathmatch, Deathmatch, CTF, Infection are just some of the gamemodes in this game with more to come down the line. The game runs at 60 FPS (Double of the 360 version) and makes gameplay more smooth and faster-paced than before. Gun play is balanced and fair. And just like Halo, everyone spawns with the same weapon choices. Its nice to see that gunplay was a huge focus for this game as many shooters now a days focus on more is better instead of limited but balanced. If you like Halo's Gameplay, you'll love this game's multiplayer.\n\n- Overall Performance: 8/10 *Updated as of July 31st*\n\nIssues like crashes have not happened to me personal, but I have seen people complain about it. However, In all most every update (which are frequent) show that they know and are dedicated to resolving issues and bugs while still adding new things to its multiplayer. People have complained about the mouse aiming bug/issue. I have not witnessed this or agree with this. Also, If you're looking for a HUGE community, there is a decent amount but don't be surprised if there are only a few games.\n\nWill continue to update and re-review the game once it has been updated.\n\n- Replay Value: 10/10\n\nThis game has the same replay value from Halo 3. With the game comes a TON of maps to play on. Maps from Halo, Counter-strike, Goldeneye 007, Unreal Tournment and many more. Its gamemodes are a ton of fun. If you love infection, this is 2nd greatest infection game (besides Halo) for great fun. One of the features that keep this game alive is the community and workshop. The editor mode is easy and simple to build stuff like Minecraft. All those maps built are in the workshop where you can play even more maps. With more updates coming down the line with new gamemodes, maps and weapons. This game has a ton to offer and play for hundreds of thousands of hours.\n\n- Overall Score: 9 / 10\n\nIts a great game. If you like Halo or Custom Games you'll love this game. It has so much to offer for the price its offering of $5 USD ($4 USD right now). Although its community isn't as huge as Halo or Counter-strike, its a decent amount. JForce has been a confident with their game from the very beginning and continues to put hardwork forward in every update. Its gameplay is balanced and smooth with some technical flaws but that doesn't stop it from being one of the greatest shooters I've played since the Halo Series. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND to anyone.","July 29, 2014","true","37.4"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

In Zombie Survival, Co-op is VITAL. Zombies are fierce, and you must act fast. But take a second too long, and you're food-unless your buddy behind you makes a clean kill! When given the chance, build up defenses with the Miner Gun to extend your chance of action! Occasionally, a dead zombie drops small amounts of ammo, so loot when given the opportunity! Free-for-all mode makes you use your brain a bit more. With the speed and agility, you and your enemies will be dashing corners and bouncing off walls here and there. Keep that triggerfinger ready for anything! Team Murdermatch is a different story. Vehicles are strong when every seat is being used, so you need to make a big enough force to startle your enemy and go from defense to offense. Or take to the borderlines and give sniper support to your team as they advance throughout the map. In Murder the Flag, Things get hectic. Because the combat is pretty brutal and quick, you and your team need to be vigilant. You never know what the enemy is doing. That is why you must keep the flag gaurded securly, while a strike team goes to the enemy base and snags the flag. Good luck getting home in one piece. Last but not least, is the horror show of infection. One player starts as a zombie, with the optional help of other Zombie AI. This player must go and kill other humans. Using their tounge to bring the survivor to them, or bloody claws to shred both flesh and construction, the zombies will easily breach the humans line of defense! One by one, the humans will be picked off by the speedy undead. Humans, watch the bodies of the fallen survivors. Zombie players have the chance to eat the dead survivor and evolve traits. Do whatever it takes to halt the zombies, or they will get stronger and stronger before you see it coming! Once you have esperienced the chaos and want to relax, you might want to head over to Map-Making Mode.This is where you create your blocky battlefield.\nI have introduced Murder Miners to many of my friends, in which they all thought the game was really fun. If you ask me, you should grab this game and have a game night with all your buddies on a Friday night!","July 23, 2014","true","13.6"," 20 of 30 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","20","30","0","0"

Murder Miners. They say it's halo and minecraft. I say that is not the case. You can expect blocks, sure, sure. But that is where the minecraft aspect ends.\n\nThe gameplay is of course, is very much like Halo CE, with the twelve shot magnum, the four shot snipers, motion sensors, and the shields, the players armor, but there's more than that. You have WAY more mobility than in any halo game I have seen. You can sprint, dodge, double jump(more like wall scaling) and 'ram' attack, a special movement option players get in versus modes. they look down while sprinting, increasing their movement speed, and become a deadly walking projectile. So why is this Halo and Minecraft?\n\nHalo and Minecraft? No. no, no, no, and no. First, there is no survival concept whatsoever. No food, no home to build before night, and no open world three times the size of earth. There is Forge/ Creative mode, no doubt, but it is not halo and minecraft.\n\nMy description of Murder Miners would be Halo gameplay hybridized with Unreal Tournament,(Look that game up on here, its pretty sick!) due to the high player mobility, arena maps, and weapon balancing, with a pinch of minecraft blocks.\n\nAs I'm sure what many of you want to know, how is the infection? I'd say it's probably the best infection you can possibly find in any game, and yes it's 10 times better than halo. In fact, it makes halo infecton look like someone took a giant pile of crap, and combined it with another pile of crap and placed it in a microwave for 10 minutes. Disgusting. As a Zombie, you can tongue grapple, activate radar, and level up by consuming the corpses of the freshly dead. This awesome ability makes you faster and stronger, and your abilities become more efficient. And your levels stick with you after death! It is the first game where I truly had fun playing as zombie.\n\nTo me, this game was a divine gift from the heavens. I believe that if you love halo, but know that the series won't be getting better any time soon, you need this in your library. It's fun with friends, it's competitive, it has a lot of content for what the devs are charging, so get it asap!","July 24, 2014","true","34.8"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","16","23","0","0"

It seems like a rip-off of Halo and minecraft (both inspirations for the dev), but it is more than that, it is one of those games that is more than the sum of its parts. The weapons in the game are extremely satisfying, more so than some major titles, each with its own character (my personal fav is the shotgun, which allows you to camoflage and become a stack of blocks). Combat is sound, not outstanding in its mechanics, but extremely fun and entertaining. The game has more gamemodes than you need, all of which are great (infection stands out), Users can make new maps and upload them for use, allowing (over time) for a nigh infinite amount of replayability, as of writing it has an active player base (within 5 minutes of hosting a server i had over 10 people), and most of this playerbase is friendly and helpful.\nI cant say anymore as i do not want to ruin the fun, if your looking for a great game to play with friends, look no further than this, a 4-pack is only (again as of writing) is only Â£2.02, which is ridiculously worth it. Id be more than willing to pay Â£20 for this game, and its only Â£0.75 (Â£6.99 at full price), no other game will give you as much satisfaction at such a great price, ill see you in-game :)\n\nEDIT: it says something about a game when the only negative reviews are for a lack of players, which has been fixed, and is on the rise.","September 28, 2014","true","4.5"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

Like I mentioned, the game is dead and I mean COD:WAW on PC dead. But you may find a few servers on a lucky day. But what's great about this game is that the devs (JForce, who are really cool) still have weekly games, which basically means that every Wednesday the devs make an announcement on the game group saying "Come Play Murder Miners with the Devs!" The devs are very active, and occasionally post something about the upcoming sequel, Murder Miners X which could be very promising.\nBut I've been rambling about how active this game is for too long, so I'm just gonna wrap this up by saying that you better be prepared to have another random game that you don't play in your library if you dont get your friends in on this game.\nI forgot to mention how cheap this game is. When it goes on sale it's literaly $0.99 USD which is really cheap for a game this fun (at least with friends). I do recommend this game, but be cautious when you buy it.\n\nEDIT: As it turns out, Call of Duty: World at War multiplayer isn't dead. Another dumb thing I've said in a review for a game.

This game is really cheap and offers a LOT for its small price. This game has the gameplay of the original Halo Combat Evolved and the environments of Minecraft to make a creative shooter experience that has never been done so well. I started playing this game 3 years ago on Xbox 360 and I've just moved to PC and I have 10+ hours in counting in just a month. Unlike other indie shooters it has a focus on skill while most are like generic Call of Duty minecraft reskins. Starting off you will be given a choice to create a character which isn't really the best I have to admit but there is enough to "pimp" your character. Then you have the  simple and bland offline or multiplayer. Unfortunately this game is really just a multiplayer game because all that is offered to you without Wifi connection is zombies and the PC version does not support split screen as the Xbox 360 version does.  Moving on you have standard deathmatch, TDM, CTF, Infection, Zombies, and Yolo Mode(Murdergames for Xbox 360 veterans). While both deathmatch variants are pretty simple in objective, Murder the Flag(CTF) is the classic team flag capture game mode. The funny thing is when you "murder"(capture) a flag, you can hear moans that is kinda creepy though...Moving on, zombies is a bit different than your average game. In Murder Miners, zombies are fast and attack you in packs so you BETTER run! And even worse they can even break blocks. Be sure to play this mode with a buddy or you'll be dying fast! The only problem is that the zombies are a bit dull. They all have the same objective and just continuously come at you. But there is also INFECTION! You can be the zombie and compete against player ones too. This is probably the most popular mode for the game by far(I advise you always use a shotgun btw). Being a zombie brings a new play style. You can tongue grab your victims and can level up! Then Yolo mode is really just a 1 life only game mode that can be fun and tactical. Aside from its game modes you can customize your match and lobby as you wish with many options and moddifications. Yes there are vehicles in this game, but only two. There is a hover bike which is really used for fast transportation but also a attack hovercraft known as the Murdership which fires meteors but very slow. And finally-the game has map creation. You can make your very own maps for FREE! Its not easy though, and the map creation honestly isn't much after placing blocks. You can change the skybox, make blocks undestructible(the game has destructible enviorments!) and some other stuff too. Then you can play it and have your dream battle! Even better you can upload it to steam workshop to share your map with others or get maps from the community. You can have intimate 1v1 matches or have all out 30 player warfare! The biggest concern for this game is the lack of lobbies played on PC which honestly has a lower player count than the Xbox 360.

The minecraft look turned me off from the game but after trying it, I was sold. The game plays like an action arcade with different modes (zombies, CTF, TDM etc...). I like the game for its simplicity, it's action, and the levels.\n\n1 problem : no one plays this game. I thought OK, maybe a few servers are alive and there are a few players always lingering in the game. As this is true usually, this game is literally dead online. I've managed to squeeze in a few games, but after finishing one good luck finding another.\n\nTO DEVS : maybe put AI into the game to fill spots? There are some of us that do want to play! Do something like 007 Nightfire did and I'm sure sales would spike, and so would the servers :)!\n\n\nRating : 7.5/10\n\n\nBuy on sale ~ and START PLAYING THE GAME! GET YOUR FRIENDS ON TOO! HECK TELL THE NEIGHBORS WE NEED TO FILL THE SERVERS! TELL JA RULE.","August 1, 2014","true","0.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Murder Miners? Its a pretty fun game\n\nWith 2 parts Halo and 1 part Zombie Survival with just a dash of Mine Craft, you get this little miracle!\nWhat makes this game super fun and addicting is that, you are not on a race for RANKS and NEW ARMOR, Giving it the fun gaming feeling you should get when playing a FPS! You do not have ranks and have every weapon available! (Except if the Host disables it) You have the same power and abilities as everyone else does! You are able to customize your player with Halo-Like Helmets and a decent size color list with making about every body-part a different color!\n\nYou are able to create your own maps with a minecraft ease OR quickly join in and rekt havoc into a DEATHMATCH, TEAM DEATHMATCH, and CFT! Dont even get me started about Infection or Zombie survival! 2 DIFFERENT but similar game-type where you are able to fend off endless hordes of zombies-things on ANY type of map, or join the ranks of the undead and destroy the lives of many who cry under the nearest desk! (BTW your able to disguise your selves as blocks shhhh ;P )\n\nEvery Wednesday, a person from the Developers itself hosts a game that lasts from 6 pm to 7pm (Central) with on average 15 to 20 players at once!\n\nIf your looking for a fun and easy FPS without the hassle of worrying about what your rank is...then this game is the one you want! Even buy 4 copies at once to give it to your friends, so your able to enjoy a fun and spooky time with them (Zombie Survival gets pretty spooky!)\n\nI Highly recommend this Fun and Spooky Game! For only $1.99, your getting it no better anywhere else! (except when its on sale for $ .99)","February 22, 2015","true","94.0"," 18 of 30 people (60%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","60","18","30","4","2"

Really scratches the Halo itch for anyone (such as myself) who is unwilling to hunt down a cheap copy of the original Halo or pay $20 for it. Game modes, from the zombie mode to the deathmatch, also heavily reference Halo (haven't seen Grifball yet, though).\nWhat the developers lack in imagination they've more than make up for in execution, as the gameplay is intensely fun. Playing as a zombie in zombie mode is about the only exception to the fun, as it often takes a full swarm of zombies to overwhelm a single player (if that player can find a high-up spot with open views on all sides, that is). The game is currently Multiplayer only, so purchase with caution as the longevity isn't guarenteed.\nGameplay:\nhttp://youtu.be/sEbn8ceaDwg","July 28, 2014","true","7.9"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrmayge/recommended/274900/","mrmayge","Defib Kid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrmayge/","130 products in account","It's a Halo knockoff and a Minecraft knockoff with some genuinely unique ideas thrown into the mix. Even 1v1'ing with a friend is fun. Getting into a big match on a blocky recreation of CoD's Terminal map is just boatloads of fun.\nThe gunplay is surprisingly good, with every weapon feeling balanced and useful for a different playstyle. The hookshot and miner gun mix into the guns well and add a unique element to gunfights. You could shoot your enemies until they die as they try to do the same to you, or you could whip our your miner gun, open a pit beneath them and toss your grenades down it.\nThere are loads of original maps, but my favorite maps are the aforementioned block-based recreations of famous Halo, CoD, Counter Strike and Goldeneye maps. They all play like the originals, and many have secret passageways useful for sneaking up on an opponent. You can also build and destroy most of the blocks on the map, and save your bombarded/constructed variations into a brand new map.\nThere is no matchmaking system, and no way to invite people to a private match that I recall seeing. So getting into a game with just your friends is sometimes tricky. The graphics are obviously not max-resolution 4K swagology. But the art style is extremely charming.\nBuy this game. It's only $2 at the time of writing, and you'll at the VERY least get a healthy serving of lols for your money. If you're like me, though, those $2 will get you a shooter you look forward to playing for hours whenever you hear someone else has a copy.","May 25","true","3.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","2"

However, at this point, It has one big problem: hardly anyone's playing it. I'm sure this game will evolve into (and surpass) the beast it was on the 360 as the community grows larger but for now, it has a very small player base. Aside from that, Murder Miners is definately worth it's humble price. The gamplay is perfect for Halo and Minecraft fans alike (but more so for Halo fans) and the creative maps and remakes should to attract an even wider audiance....eventually. All we can do now is tell our friends about it and cross our fingers that one day we'll see a whole screen full of servers  to choose from.","July 26, 2014","true","49.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's better with all your friends in on teamspeak. The grappling hook is easy to master and reminds me of the old days in quake.\n\nThen I discovered the map remakes. WOW.

That being said, the game is fun and is based on a block style, which most of these blocks can be destroyed with weapons or melee at any time.

I mean, 5 USD for 4 copies of a game to play with friends? I mean, even a bad game would seem kinda reasonable at that price range to some. Well, I expected Ace of Spades, with zombies and instead I got a game that felt more like Quake in terms of mobility and competitive gameplay. The gamemodes are plentiful, with around 10 of them available. There are literally hundreds of maps, and that's not including the maps available from the workshop. So, for 2 dollars for one copy and 5 dollars for 4 copies, I see a great multiplayer indie game that runs well, is quite fun and is incredibly cheap for what you get. This is a rare bargain for steam. Games like these can sell for 10 dollars normally, but this price is such a steal. Too bad it wasn't frontpaged or anything, it's kind of hidden away on the store as a reward for those who find it. There were only about 3 servers when I last played, which shows that the servers have died out quite a bit since last year when the game just came out. It's still worth getting the 4 pack and playing with friends. It was a great deal for the price and a fun Quake feeling game.\n\nTLDR: IT'S A GOOD GAME FOR THE INCREDIBLY LOW PRICE","August 16, 2015","true","1.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

I'm not crazy about it. Well, I'm going to write a long one again.\n\nHere are some cons:\n1) The (annoying) players I have encountered are either; nerds that spent way too much time perfecting their sniping skills then spam the comments with annoying text (360NOSCOPE FaZe newb buttcheeks la la la *insert curse words*) or total noobs that get â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ off when you beat them fair and square claiming that you cheated then go put themselves at an advantage. (have vehicles put at their spawn... ONLY at their spawn. -.- team against you in murdermatch, unlimited ammo only on their team plus speed increase, etc.)\n2) The. lag. is. real. I'm talking players teleporting and AIs randomly spawning then immediately dying. (happened a couple times to me but maybe it was just hackers. To all you hackers, go back to call of duty. :p)\n3) Graphics are as poor as minecraft. (i dislike 8-bit, messes with my eyes especially since i play for quite a while) Ugh. My eyes.\n4) Vehicles. It's not really fun when everyone just depends on Murderbike or Murdership to kill each other. Gets really boring quick...\n\nHere are some pros:\n1) You can hide (transform into the blocks with shotgun) and watch the people struggle to find you. I literally just got out of a game where after I won two rounds of 25 pts. then I hid and watched them struggle to find me xD They were seriously teaming, side by side and won't even shoot each other. Like come on, I'm fine with you spamming me with grenades but this is PvE. Jerks.\n2) Joys of making new friends. :)\n3) I'm not the person who would go for FPS but I quite enjoyed actually being exceptionally good. Also, great for if you want to improve yourself with sniper. (No sniper clan for me though, cqc ftw.)\n4) It's Halo mixed with Minecraft.

Have you ever been killed by an apache helicopter that was being flown by a zombie on the other team? No? That's what I thought. In this masterpeice of a game, you can not only die to a zombie piloted helicopter, you can also play in literally dozens of community made maps like that one map from Goldeneye or the map named Hoth from a Starwars game, or something.

One downside that I've expierienced even as host was my chatbox going "back in time" and showing what has been said minutes ago, this also removes your ability to talk in chat for some reason, or atleast I haven't been able to get anyone to jump when I said "Jump if you can see me saying this in chat". Kicking someone isn't effective because the person you kicked can still join back.\n\n\nBesides those negatives and load of bugs, it's really fun and you may think that it's just Minecraft + Halo but it's not, it's Ninja + Minecraft + Halo.

In this masterpeice of a game, you can not only die to a zombie piloted helicopter, you can also play in literally dozens of community made maps like that one map from Goldeneye or the map named Hoth from a Starwars game, or something.

I'm not crazy about it. Well, I'm going to write a long one again.\n\nHere are some cons:\n1) The (annoying) players I have encountered are either; nerds that spent way too much time perfecting their sniping skills then spam the comments with annoying text (360NOSCOPE FaZe newb buttcheeks la la la *insert curse words*) or total noobs that get â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ off when you beat them fair and square claiming that you cheated then go put themselves at an advantage. (have vehicles put at their spawn... ONLY at their spawn. -.- team against you in murdermatch, unlimited ammo only on their team plus speed increase, etc.)\n2) The. lag. is. real. I'm talking players teleporting and AIs randomly spawning then immediately dying. (happened a couple times to me but maybe it was just hackers. To all you hackers, go back to call of duty. :p)\n3) Graphics are as poor as minecraft. (i dislike 8-bit, messes with my eyes especially since i play for quite a while) Ugh. My eyes.\n4) Vehicles. It's not really fun when everyone just depends on Murderbike or Murdership to kill each other. Gets really boring quick...\n\nHere are some pros:\n1) You can hide (transform into the blocks with shotgun) and watch the people struggle to find you. I literally just got out of a game where after I won two rounds of 25 pts. then I hid and watched them struggle to find me xD They were seriously teaming, side by side and won't even shoot each other. Like come on, I'm fine with you spamming me with grenades but this is PvE. Jerks.\n2) Joys of making new friends. :)\n3) I'm not the person who would go for FPS but I quite enjoyed actually being exceptionally good. Also, great for if you want to improve yourself with sniper. (No sniper clan for me though, cqc ftw.)\n4) It's Halo mixed with Minecraft. Oh joy.\n\nSo yeah, I guess I recommend but if you are as competitive as me you'll be raging after your first couple of games. (The Noob days...

What do you get when Halo and Minecraft do the nasty and make a baby? You get this bad boy, Murder Miners.\n\nThough some may call it a Halo-inspired Minecraft shooter, don't expect to see much building in this game because of the title "Minecraft". In fact, this game does some great fan service to the Halo kids who happen to enjoy that touch of Minecraft.\n\nHalo players will feel right at home in this game, using some of the weapons such as the battle rifle, sniper, shotgun, machine gun (assault rifle), frag grenades and plasma (sticky) grenades, energy sword, etc. You get to customize your own character (spartan) and play in game modes such as  Murder Match (free-for-all), Team Murdermatch (team deathmatch), Murder the Flag (Capture the Flag), and the games own modes like Map Making Mode and Zombie Survival. Even more fan service to the Halo kids, there are future game modes planned to come such as Murderball (Hot Potato / Odd Ball) and Murdernaught (Juggernaut ), some familiar playgrounds. It's pretty much Halo, retextured Minecraft.\n\nAlong with the Halo fan service, there are also some game modes for those who enjoy building. I guess this is where the building part comes in. I mentioned Map Making Mode earlier and I've seen some awesome maps made by the community. Custom maps for any and every game mode. You can create solo or host a server and have public or private friends join and build whatever your heart desires. I've even seen remade CoD maps like Nuketown from Black Ops and maps from the Halo game itself. There's a little something of everything for everyone. Heck, there are even vehicles you can ride and fly around in on some maps. (*NOTE* that the game does have its own original maps, it isn't completely a Halo game)\n\nMost multiplayer games these days have a leveling system where you have to grind it out and spend hours reaching levels to unlock decent equipment to be right there with every other player; this game, however, has no leveling system. Your skill grows with the time you spend playing, and you don't need to grind out hours to unlock anything. You have everything given to you from the start and it feels great.\n\nMy only complaint about the game is the community falls short. My time playing, I didn't see much activity going on. Every server I joined didn't  have that many players, there weren't that many servers up, and if there were, if was from players who hosted game modes and set the rules so they could win. It just felt unfair at times, it was really cheap; however, I did find some moments to host my own deathmatch servers and have a nice amount of players join. Occasionally, some decent death match and CTF servers were up, and I was able to record some awesome gameplay footage for my YouTube channel.\n\nThis is a game I will be playing for a while. As a fan of Halo, I feel right at home and I've been addicted and recording. Some gameplay footage can be seen here-\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok0W33PRR5Y\n\nI wish all of my friends had this game, and I wish more people played the game. This is a game I would highly recommend.","September 20, 2014","true","12.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

Having never played it on xbox (or even heard of it for that matter) I was pleasently surprised. The shooting mechanics are spot on, the character customization is surprisingly awesome for how simple it is, and the sheer amount of maps (thats not including the user made ones on the workshop) is astounding. Plus you can make your own maps rather easily, so if you feel like playing on Guardian from halo 3, or on the sky scrapers of metropolis all you have to do is make it. Overall this is definitley something you should grab if you enjoy games like halo, CS, UT etc, or enjoy creating awesome landscapes for others to play on without the hassle of the unreal editor or the hammer editor.","July 26, 2014","true","15.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You have simple controls, some basic weapons, a small range of common multiplayer modes, and a simplified level creation system. This all comes together in a great package of a game. You won't need to worry much about learning curves or leaderboards or anything complex. It's all very basic and straightforward. This means you can just play and have fun in the moment. Then when you want to quit playing for the day, you can. When you want to jump in, you can. There's even a cool zombie mode where you can fight against AI zombies so even if you're playing alone offline you can still play the game. It also has a relatively low performance requirement while still looking very pretty with the crisp, pixelated graphics. All of the levels are created from textured cubes. There's a map making mode that basically just has you using one of the game's guns in order to build and shape your own levels. You can then easily save them to the workshop from the game. It's all so simple and user friendly that it's brilliant!\n\nThere are some downsides, but most of them are due to the simplicity, which has counterpoints as upsides. There are no leaderboards or rankings or clans or anything too fancy and complicated, which may turn off a lot of more hardcore players. Also, it can be weird to figure out the ins and outs of making maps at first, and the simple map making system does take a lot of time due to the lack of any advanced, time-saving features. The biggest let down is that it can be hard to get games going sometimes. It may take a long time to get people in your lobby or even to find other players. There's also no local co op play nor any campaign for single player, which is also a little sad for those without good internet connections. So this game comes with built in pros and cons.\n\nStill, with all the simple fun to be had for hours and hours of gamemodes and level creation, it's well worth the incredibly low price of 2 dollars. It's a steal. I just wish my computer could still run it, but right now my computer is rather... worn out. So this game is a bit too much for it right now. I do look forward to coming back to it when I can and making more levels because this is tons of fun and right up my alley. If you have a few bucks leftover or especially if it's on sale and you're into simple first person shooters, it's certainly worth your time and your money. I wonder what the sequel is going to be like... hmm.","August 13, 2015","true","156.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

Easy to create servers and share maps makes it even better. I highly recommend buying this game for only $2. I also hope one day it becomes active.\n\nOverall, I'd rate this 3.5/5!\n\nPS: Game is really well designed, built and fun, but it is really inactive and hard to find a server playable with people and little lag.

At the current price point it is worth buying. It is fun to play.  It really is just a FPS in minecraft style.  The style is just the appearance.  For me, I find after playing modern FPS games the graphics are hard for me to really to  accept, but my kids love it.  The movement is good and controls are tight. I would like to have some type of leveling system because I find that it gives people more incentive to play.  Give higher level players some cosmetic or minor edges for leveling up. Need more variety of guns, attachments, maybe stun or flash, and other equipment.  The number of maps that this came with was outstanding. Some of the user made remakes are great.\n\nProbably this biggest con is the community is very small. Most games are biggest right after launch. So far this weekend when servers should be full there is hardly anyone playing.  I usually just start a public server and people will join so I guess that is good.  But there needs to be more advertising.

Making the maps I want is so easy in this game, although it becomes an actual project when you want to make a balanced map with great flow. It is actually surprising that for a shooting game, the casual players and dedicated community members don't have that locker room behavior which you find in other shooting games the moment you join a server.\n\nObviously, this is a game best played with friends but never be shy to make new ones for the sole purpose of just playing this game.","April 17, 2015","true","84.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

This game is a shining example of what multiplayer games should be. No annoying progression system, no dlc or microtransactions, no 12 year olds â¥â¥â¥â¥ing your mother (usually), just fun in its purest form, and for only $2 as well! I can't say anything about the standard competitive gamemodes in this game, as I've basically never played them, but I can definitely speak for infection. Infection is one of the most craziest, chaotic, and fun gamemodes I've ever played. One person starts out as the infected and their objective is to kill all of the survivors. When a survivor is killed, they also become infected. This keeps going until there is only 1 person left fending off a horde of infected, and eventually they are killed and the game is over. There are settings you can mess around with as well if you're hosting, such as giving the survivors infinite ammo (I totally recommend doing this, as the grenade spam that ensues is hilarious). This game also comes with an in-game map editor that is extremely easy to use and allows you to publish to the steam workshop as well. The devs are very community-orientated and host community playdates every Wednesday, which are hectic and fun as hell! The main reason I haven't played in a while though is because I'm in college now, but believe if I had more time (and my friends had more time) I would be playing the hell out of this game!\n\nPros\n-----\n+ Infection is a god-tier gamemode\n+ No progression system, so you can enjoy the full game from the start\n+ No DLC or microtransactions (it's sad that this is a pro nowadays)\n+ In-game map editor that can be used alone or with friends\n+ AMAZING community-made maps\n+ Awesome devs who clearly care about the game and the community\n+ Other gamemodes such as TDM and CTF (which are still great and use community maps, I just prefer infection)\n+ The â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ hookshot makes the game a lot more fun that it already was\n+ It's only 2 â¥â¥â¥â¥ing dollars\n\nCons\n-----\n- There are none. It's offensive that you even think there would be.\n\nOverall score: 11/10 (God-tier perfection)\n\nSeriously, do yourself a favor and buy the 4 pack, get 3 of your best friends, and have the time of your life.\n\n( Also, the hype is real for Murder Miners X )","December 6, 2015","true","65.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

There are other maps too. If you are a creative person, make your own maps for any game mode! There are many blocks to choose from in Murder Miners.\n\nThe game modes to choose from are: Team Murdermatch (Team Deathmatch), Murdermatch (Deathmatch), Murder The Flag (Capture The Flag), YOLO mode (Mostly used for hunger games maps), Infection, and Zombie Survival. You can easily make your own server, way more easy then TF2 or Counter Strike. And there is tons of options to change for your game!

Secondly, I have been playing this game since 2 weeks after it's debut on the Xbox Live Indie Games section. After all my experience with it after its beta stage up until the newest update, I can say it still is an amazing game. In fact, this game is what got me interested in Halo, I had never played Halo properly before then.\n\nSo what is Murder Miners? It's essentially FPS inspired by the gameplay of Halo with the graphics of Minecraft. In fact, that's all it has to do with Minecraft. Now onto the gameplay. The weapons included (the main ones being the Pistol, Machinegun, Shotgun, Sniper and Battle Rifle) play pretty much the same as their Halo counterparts, particularly Halo: CE because of the 3-headshot-kill Pistol. This will appeal to Halo fans but also most FPS fans as a whole because they are just so balanced. However, movement I find is quite unique. Yes there is Halo jumping, but there are also pretty nice mechanics including wall-jumping, multi-directional dashing and unlimited sprint, which I feel pretty much allow you to be a ninja.\n\nWhile what I have metioned so far describe this as a competitive shooter (which it is), it also has a great casual side. The main part of this being infection mode. This is my favourite mode in MM, as I feel it is the best infection mode out of any FPS game I played, as the zombies are not underpowered as they have a grappling tounge to move across the map quickly, and are able to devour corpses to level up.\n\nAnother great thing about murder miners is the map creation. Now I'm not too into map-making myself, but the game's Minergun allows you to place and destroy blocks with different modes. These options allow you to make maps pretty much any way you want. It's also really easy to use so map-making won't be too complicated, although it can take a while depending on what sort of map you want to make.\n\nAre there any bad points about Murder Miners? Well, not too much. The only real thing I have a problem with is that when playing with a lot of people (particularly 18+ people) the game can tend to lag a bit. However, I have an i3, so it could just be me, but I have also seen this problem on the Xbox version. But thankfully this doesn't happen too much. Another thing to mention is that JForce are really involved with their community and respond to any suggestions or complaints they may have. Also updates used to be very frequent last year (pretty much every month), but are kind of slow at the moment, but this is due to the big vehicle update late last year and with porting the game to PC. I'm sure updates are likely to be frequent again, which is a good thing.\n\nAll-in-all I fully recommend this game, as it is really good and fairly cheap (Â£1.59). I would also highly reccomend getting a 4-pack, as it is not too much more expensive and this game is awesome with friends. I have been playing this game for a long time and will continue to play it.","November 2, 2014","true","28.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

Then I looked at the video on the store page, it looked decent and well done. What really turned my thoughts around were the other reviews, though. They were very good, saying great things about the game.\n\nThen the price, only about a dollar on sale.\n\nI bought it to see how it was.\n\nLong story short, it's pretty enjoyable, with fast paced and fun combat. A few different modes as well, and an acceptable sized community. There is workshop support as well, so maps you make by, yes, building, can be published to the public. All I could really ask for, is more weapon and map building features, and a little bit of graphics shaders options, nothing too heavy. (There isn't very good lighting and atmosphere.)\n\n7/10","November 3, 2014","true","15.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Personally i enoyed the game but i fall into the sneaky basturd sniper catagory so go figure, Make sure you play with friends you can voice chat with, and have the zombies on, you'll get a kick out of the rage that occurs afterwards xD","September 27, 2014","true","5.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Especially the zombie survival mode where you would try and hold off against increasingly difficult waves of zombies until you eventually fell.\n\nNow this version on the PC is even better! With vehicles, two more weapons, and a great community of maps to choose from! What's great about this game is that you can make your own maps and upload them to the steam workshop for people to download and mess around with.\n\nSpeaking of community the devs are doing everything they can to bring more players to the game. Even going as far as 81% discounts and selling 4 packs for only 2.89$. It is extremely easy to play with friends or huge battles with over 10 players. Although those often just become insane sniper fights.\n\nThe game plays a lot like a halo game would with the "OP" pistol, battle rifles, snipers, along with a couple extra fun guns to work with like mineguns to place blocks with and hookshots to fly around the map with. And most of the weapons have extra abilities like the machine gun that empties the whole clip in a second and the minegun that fires a huge blast of energy at your enemies.\n\nSome might look at the game and think "Er mah gurd! de grafics lurk leik meincwaft!" but the blocks make it awesome to build zombie survival forts in or to recreate your favorite Counter Strike map with.\n\nIn the zombie mode you can play as the zombies and join the hordes taking out the survivors or be the lone alpha zombie and scare your friends silly. The zombies have the ability to break through walls, lunge at survivors, or even use their tongues like a smoker from L4D and drag them straight to your bloody claws.\n\nAbsolutely would recommend buying this game. And if you have a friend or two you should absolutely buy the 4-Pack to have hours of fun playing with. (Even though I only have 5 hours on my record I have played this like crazy on the xbox.)","October 8, 2014","true","5.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Its not dramatic when it tries to be. there are times where it is literally 30 seconds of just getting kicked from a lobby, just to waste time.

I would recomend being able to put bots in the game. you can put zombies in for infection mode but once your a zombie there's no one to kill, so bots would be nice.

Unfortunately, my career as a murder miner was cut short by Thatcher in the 80s, when she decided to switch Britain's focus to Murder Oil, so I'm glad to have found a game which can accurately represent the feelings I used to get when I hookshotted into someone and then used a sword to slice their bloody head off.\n\nMany would say that it's a shame that the community for this game is so starved of life; however, I view this as a positive, as it means I've developed an intense friendship with the other fifty or so players. This game is the single greatest video game in history, if The Louvre displayed digital content, they'd tear down the Mona Lisa and replace it with a montage of my sick hookshot combos.\n\nFor real, in all sincerity, buy Murder Miners now, and buy another copy for your friend, and two more for your dad and mum, the total price of which is less than a Subway sandwitch. That doesn't seem too pricy for literally unlimited enjoyment.\n\nOn an unrelated note, I am recently unemployed, and if the team at Murder Miners would like to hire me to write about the lore of this storied and fabled game, they should.\n\nBuy Murder Miners right now, and get good for the pro-am tournament at ESL Cologne 2016.\n\nThanks, Thatcher, you heartless cow.","August 29, 2015","true","1.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","57","4","7","6","1"

You can even customize your soldier like Halo, by choosing from a number of different helmets, and being able to change the color of each individual part with every color in the visible spectrum.\n\nThere's a nice variety of gamemodes, even a Halo-style infection type, along with standard deathmatch and CTF, among others.\n\nIt isn't the most active game (meaning you're not going to see hundreds of matches online at one time), but there's still plenty of players to keep up your enjoyment.\n\nSo if you want Halo on Steam, pick this up, you won't be disappointed.\n\nThe best part: it's cheap!

Later, I pulled a guy out of a helicopter using my newly-grown zombie tentacles and ate him.\n\nThat was my first hour playing this game, so yeah, I would say I got my $2 worth almost immediately.\n\nThis game looks silly, and it definitely is. But the gameplay is solid, with lots of variation and fun to be had. Gunplay is very similar to the original Halo, with community maps and gamemodes that exceed the scope of any FPS I've played before. The simple, 90's era graphics might be a turn off for some, but they really allow the gameplay to flourish in ways big studio FPS games rarely do. Maps can be massive in scale, vertically and horizontally. The community created maps range from entirely original, unique concepts, to faithful recreations of classic FPS maps (the other day I was playing CTF on Halo's Blood Gulch and Zombie mode on Goldeneye's Complex). The rudimentary graphics also mean the game runs as smooth as butter, with no latency or framerate issues to speak of.\n\nIn short, this game is immediately fun, excellently conceived and executed, and is a great value at only $2.

So I thought: Oh, it looks interesting and price isn't too high!\nWhat I was expecting: that this game would be ideal fusion of L4D and Ace of Spades.\nWere these expections met?\nIt's hard to say. Main part of this game is zombie slashing. That was done not bad, but I'm not about to say that it was done perfect. AI of zombies is - literally - stupid. They can be running into the wall for hours,days,months, they coulda make some families and live happily ever afte... stop, they couldn't. They just go into the freakin' wall and do nothing at all. After that they die :(\nOn the other hand, as far as I'm concerned, they are incredibly strong and could kill ya with 2 strikes.\n\nSo, in my point of view, zombies aren't too hot in the game. What about positive features?\n\nFirst of all, there's not a big quantity, but there's a huge range of weapons and they differ from each other: pistol for accurate players, shotgun for crazy ones who are to get close and tear enemy apart, and etc. So, you will say: Hey, these weapons are not interesting. We can see them in every game!\nSo, Is there a lot of games where you are able to get hookshot, jump on the top of map, get your sniper and smash all the heads that are to kick you hell outta there? And are there games where you could cut off the shoulders 5-10 heads of enemies with your mega-sword and get to the big hill with impulse of it's strike?\nAlso, there's a mine gun. It's interesting, but I'm inclined to believe that it's not THE BEST MINEGUN EVER.\n\nBy the way, game give us an opportunity to play with no zombies and just create a big dash on some map with lots of people. So.... sometimes it's really possible to find a deathmatch lobby, but in most cases it's not.\n\nAnyway, game let us destroy all the map with weapons, grenades, cyber-bikes and mega-helicopters with 3 places for all of your buddies. It's not a big problem to destroy city that was created by a teenager from Wisconsin.\n\nSo, I was about to forget. There's a workshop here and it really works (personally my client didn't want to download maps but I'm sure it's just a bug or error of my PC, now it's OK) There we can download some maps to have more fun.\n\nFeel free to customize your model with new helmets, new colours of armour and - even - special colours of electrical sprites effects.\n\nMain flaw of the game is little maps so don't expect the game would be a minecrafted and L4D-ed analogue of BF3 (and even BF2 :-( )\n\nSo, let's be clear and brief: MM is not TOO cool game, but if you buy it feel pacient cause it's not bad and it's about to interest you... or you won't fell that you just wasted your last money to buy this game... I hope so =)\n\nAnd, it's popular to esteemate game by ten-point scale. So, my mark is 7/10\n\nThanx everybody who has read this huge piece of cake that is named review :D   (A minute of self-criticism? Why not? %))","December 21, 2014","true","8.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Advanced movement options such as wall jumping, dashing, crouch-jumping and more bring a different, refreshing take on game flow, with regular players, ninjas, and trickjumpers alike all being able to feel right at home.

It's a solid shooter, it's got map building, and character customisation, what more could I want?\nWell, the servers seemed a little sparse, but you guys don't control who plays and when.\nI just dunno.\n\nAll in all, it's pretty good, and plays like old arena shooters when you really get into it, so that's a plus.\n7/10\nGlad I bought it, and it's still better than most AAA shooters being pumped out these days.","December 5, 2014","true","3.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hey-There-Sexy/recommended/274900/","Hey-There-Sexy","Nooblet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hey-There-Sexy/","42 products in account","Don't write this off as some minecraft spin-off. I'd say it's 5% minecraft, 95% Halo. Like I know a lot of people have probably said, it uses block-based maps, and if the host doesn't disable it, you can place and destroy blocks. But a large majority of the time, that's not the focus of the gameplay in the very least. It can be a pretty competitive FPS. Or it can just be a casual game to play with friends, if you're not the competitive type. There's your standard team death match mode, free for all, and capture the flag, which are the competitive modes. And then there's the more laid-back, casual modes in Zombie Survival and Infection. In Infection, all players start out as humans, with one randomly selected player as a zombie. If the zombie kills you, you respawn as a zombie, and the game is over when all the humans are dead. The winner is the player with the most kills. I don't really like it, because it seems like a boring camp-fest, and there's always that one guy that just digs a hole and hides with a shotgun. But overall, this game is really fun. If you like Halo, you'll like this.\n\nThe weapons are pretty standard. The sniper, battle rifle, pistol, shotgun, and machine gun are all straight out of Halo. There's also the energy sword, but it works a little differently in this. It doesn't instantly lunge and one-hit-kill like the Halo sword does, but instead has to be charged for 2-3 seconds. Or you can use two weak sword attacks instead. Then there's the hookshot. Basically, it's a grappling hook straight out of batman. Or the hookshot from Legend of Zelda, if you like. Then you've got your frag grenades, which can't kill a full health/shield player, and your plasma grenades, which only kill if you actually stick a player. Everything is pretty well-balanced overall.\n\nIn addition to standard fire modes, all weapons have a secondary function or alternate fire mode. The sniper/pistol/battle rifle have scopes. The shotgun camouflages you as the same kind of blocks surrounding you, and the machine gun empties the remainder of its clip at double the normal fire rate. The sword and hookshot don't have alternate fire modes.\n\nThen, there's the miner gun. It can break single blocks, a 1x3 grid of blocks, or a 3x3 grid of blocks at a time. It also has a "Blaster" mode that requires time to charge, but releases a slow-moving explosive projectile. It can also be changed to "building" mode and used to place blocks, for mapmaking purposes, or building cover to hide behind.\n\nAnyway, there's a lot of different things you can do in this game, and for $1.99, it's an investment you probably won't regret. If this sounds like something that would interest you, don't second-guess yourself. Buy it and come play with the rest of the community!\n\nEdit/update: I'd like to also say that the casual/average community on this game is absolutely terrible. If you're a person that ragequits or boots anyone playing better than you, don't buy this game, we don't want you playing it. I'm tired of getting booted from matches when I do well, as well as hosts that end the session after getting stomped for one match. I don't ALWAYS get booted, because there are a few people that don't care if they win or lose and respect skilled players, but by large, most of the community doesn't want to play unless everyone else they're playing with sucks, and that is a very bad way to approach any game. It's very common in this game for even just moderately good players to be accused of hacking and immediately booted from the lobby.\n\nThe game is also not a polished masterpiece. There are bugs and glitches as with any game, especially indie games. But this game has very solid gameplay, a lot of variety, and it's a diamond in the rough. The sequel is hopefully going to be better when it's finally released, as it's going to have matchmaking on dedicated servers instead of user-made locally hosted lobbies, so lag will (hopefully) be less of an issue.\n\nBut if you enjoy this game, and you happen to have a spare computer and a reasonably good internet connection, add me on steam! On the murderminers.com forums, we got someone to write a script that automatically runs a lobby on its own and changes the map on its own, we just need people with the resources to run them constantly, and that would improve most players' experience with the game tremendously, as a lot of people's only complaints relate to having high ping/bad connection to the player hosting the game.\n","February 21, 2015","true","15.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hey-There-Sexy/recommended/274900/","Hey-There-Sexy","Nooblet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hey-There-Sexy/","42 products in account","Don't write this off as some minecraft spin-off. I'd say it's 5% minecraft, 95% Halo. Like I know a lot of people have probably said, it uses block-based maps, and if the host doesn't disable it, you can place and destroy blocks. But a large majority of the time, that's not the focus of the gameplay in the very least. It can be a pretty competitive FPS. Or it can just be a casual game to play with friends, if you're not the competitive type. There's your standard team death match mode, free for all, and capture the flag, which are the competitive modes. And then there's the more laid-back, casual modes in Zombie Survival and Infection. In Infection, all players start out as humans, with one randomly selected player as a zombie. If the zombie kills you, you respawn as a zombie, and the game is over when all the humans are dead. The winner is the player with the most kills. I don't really like it, because it seems like a boring camp-fest, and there's always that one guy that just digs a hole and hides with a shotgun. But overall, this game is really fun. If you like Halo, you'll like this.\n\nThe weapons are pretty standard. The sniper, battle rifle, pistol, shotgun, and machine gun are all straight out of Halo. There's also the energy sword, but it works a little differently in this. It doesn't instantly lunge and one-hit-kill like the Halo sword does, but instead has to be charged for 2-3 seconds. Or you can use two weak sword attacks instead. Then there's the hookshot. Basically, it's a grappling hook straight out of batman. Or the hookshot from Legend of Zelda, if you like. Then you've got your frag grenades, which can't kill a full health/shield player, and your plasma grenades, which only kill if you actually stick a player. Everything is pretty well-balanced overall.\n\nIn addition to standard fire modes, all weapons have a secondary function or alternate fire mode. The sniper/pistol/battle rifle have scopes. The shotgun camouflages you as the same kind of blocks surrounding you, and the machine gun empties the remainder of its clip at double the normal fire rate. The sword and hookshot don't have alternate fire modes.\n\nThen, there's the miner gun. It can break single blocks, a 1x3 grid of blocks, or a 3x3 grid of blocks at a time. It also has a "Blaster" mode that requires time to charge, but releases a slow-moving explosive projectile. It can also be changed to "building" mode and used to place blocks, for mapmaking purposes, or building cover to hide behind.\n\nAnyway, there's a lot of different things you can do in this game, and for $1.99, it's an investment you probably won't regret. If this sounds like something that would interest you, don't second-guess yourself. Buy it and come play with the rest of the community!\n\nEdit/update: I'd like to also say that the casual/average community on this game is absolutely terrible. If you're a person that ragequits or boots anyone playing better than you, don't buy this game, we don't want you playing it. I'm tired of getting booted from matches when I do well, as well as hosts that end the session after getting stomped for one match. I don't ALWAYS get booted, because there are a few people that don't care if they win or lose and respect skilled players, but by large, most of the community doesn't want to play unless everyone else they're playing with sucks, and that is a very bad way to approach any game. It's very common in this game for even just moderately good players to be accused of hacking and immediately booted from the lobby.\n\nThe game is also not a polished masterpiece. There are bugs and glitches as with any game, especially indie games. But this game has very solid gameplay, a lot of variety, and it's a diamond in the rough. The sequel is hopefully going to be better when it's finally released, as it's going to have matchmaking on dedicated servers instead of user-made locally hosted lobbies, so lag will (hopefully) be less of an issue.\n\nBut if you enjoy this game, and you happen to have a spare computer and a reasonably good internet connection, add me on steam! On the murderminers.com forums, we got someone to write a script that automatically runs a lobby on its own and changes the map on its own, we just need people with the resources to run them constantly, and that would improve most players' experience with the game tremendously, as a lot of people's only complaints relate to having high ping/bad connection to the player hosting the game.\n","February 21, 2015","true","15.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

Overall I think that it is a game worth spending on because of the different types of modes also it's only Â£1.59.","May 30, 2015","true","0.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

Murder Miners has made me a changed man, for once it has allowed me to be fully focused and keen on my style of play; as well as increase my urge to commit a Grade A Felony. Unlike it's FPS counterparts such as Dino D-Day and Clash of Clans, MM serves as a bridge between the old school style of gaming and the daily struggles of inmates. However, the price of this game is completely unreasonable, at $1 per copy this is an understatment. The game should be worth around $60 because it has great potential to becoming an extremely (if not already) the worst FPS game available. All in all if you would like to play a game that not only leaves you with your â¥â¥â¥â¥ in your hands, but also leaving you begging for more.

I made a tiny map that consists of a house, fence , tree and garage, in 4 hours. making walls should be easier, and hills are impossible: you have to click block by block\n\n-network issues: I have top tier internet, and I see other players teleporting around , once even someone saw ME teleporting around (how??); also, players with bad internet have an advantage: they teleport, and at random but frequent occasions cannot be hit /godmode. every server has >200 ping, even the ones in Europe.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Unicarn/recommended/274900/","Unicarn","Unicarn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Unicarn/","72 products in account","This game was fun, but the developers have given up on it and won't fix the many issues in the game because they want you to spend your money on the sequel. I've given up on the developers at this point.\n\nI've bought two copies of this game and I'm really disappointed in the devs that they'd just abandon this game.\n\nResponse to Ato (since Steam won't let me post it in the comments due to it being over 1,000 characters in length.)\n\nThere are many issues with the game, such as lack of an FOV slider and lack of being able to change resolution in windowed mode and you promised split screen, which is on Xbox, but not PC. The problem I have is that you're expecting us to buy MMX for the fixes. I understand that MMX will have a lot more content, but it's frustrating that in order to have features that should have been in the game from the beginning you have to buy the sequel.\n\nAlso note that continuing to update the game will help draw in more fan and keep current fans. Look at games like Warcraft 3 TFT. They've updated it so that you can play it in modern resolutions despite it being 12 years old. Another example is Terraria. It's four years old and got a massive update with at least 800 new items, new events, and new features to make the UI more easy and quick to use. I'm not saying that you should add more content to MM1, just that the issues should be fixed.\n\nI've also realized that this game is impossible for me to play on on a larger resolution monitor due to simulation sickness. I'm fine on my 1440x900 monitor, but on my 1920x1080 monitor the game makes me feel nauseous unless I play windowed, which makes it so I can't focus on the game. An FOV slider that goes up to 90 or higher FOV would fix this (MM1 has approximately 75 FOV which goes up to 90 FOV due to the aspect ratio; which isn't enough for me on a 1920x1080 monitor due to the size of it. I know you've said that TF2 has the same FOV before, which it doesn't. By default the game has 75 FOV on a 4:3 monitor, and 90 FOV on 16:9 monitor. You can increase it to 90 FOV on a 4:3 monitor and up to 110-120 on a 16:9 monitor.) Here's an example of what I mean https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGNpt63gm5c\n\nYes, I had played many hours and had fun playing competitively, but now that I can't really play on one of my computers and the developers are expecting me to buy MMX for these to be fixed, I've lost faith in JForce.","July 23, 2015","false","381.9"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","24"

The movement system is both unwieldy, unexpected, and a little clunky when trying to maneuver around. Another gripe that I have about the gameplay is the speed, the general speed with how the aiming and other aspects of weapon handling is in high octane situations. Many times, it's hard to follow what exactly is going on. I think the major cause with this is because the movement system is that of a more slower based fps, while the shooting feels like it was based off a high speed arena shooter ala Unreal Tournament.\n\nSome small minor improvements would be along the line of physical bodies for people. have it so you can not phase through each other. better weapon selection "wheel". possible the option to alter the time to kill for matches/maps. I also think an amazing feature that could be added in the future is more customizable options for how the game plays like Halo custom games.\n\nI also guess that another thing that really made me not enjoy the game was that the store page was talking about a Halo-esque playstyle. When I got into game the only Halo-esque features that I could easily recognize is the clip size for guns, the vaguely similar character model, and the shield. Personally I was expecting some gameplay to have the same flow and speed as Halo, but that could just be all on me.\n\nIf you havenât already, I would recommend getting ahold of Halo Online/El Dewrito and play that for a bit. It's a quite different experience than normal Halo 3 on Xbox. Maybe with that you could have an easy reference that you could possibly used to improve on the fps game that you make.\n\nP.S. I am a really critical guy about anything I have some interest in and see some potential in.","February 21","false","0.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","5"

I'm highly impressed with the game however.\nThe game IS in a sense a combination of Minecraft and Halo, but with a little more customization.\n\nI HIGHLY recommend this for Minecraft fans for the building and destruction assets that you have at your disposal. I do feel it is somewhat limited on what you can and can't do, but hopefully that will be added onto.\n\nWhile it is still in developement, it's still a great game nonetheless. I recommend getting it soon whilst it's still in developement and while the price will stay low.\n\nNote: It is HIGHLY recommended for Minecraft players or fans.

This game is even better on the PC. It is basically a mix of minecrafts terrain destruction and building with Halo's combat system. This game has plenty of game modes to play such as team deathmatch, capture the flag and other classics but also has a zombie survival mode and infection which is a mode where a player becomes the infected and has to find and kill all other players.

The one complaint I have is, why does the game say it has to send maps to other players even though it's a default map? It actually seems to cause lag when it pops up. Not only that, but when other players are lagging it seems to affect the rest of the players on the server. Is there any way to control what Region can play on your game? Just a thought. Outside of that, it was pretty fun to play. I don't know what to rate this really. Because it's not really a yes or a no for me, more like a maybe. Reason for this being the lag issues. Some maps are also non destructable. I think every map should, and you should be able to blow off parts of the map. That would be cool!\n\nAnyways, I'll give it a yes for now, but barely.","June 1, 2015","true","2.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I only found it because there was a link on Facebook where you could get a free key, so I figured I might as well get it and give it a try. Upon first launching the game, I was greeted with a character customisation menu featuring all the usual options (including pelvis customisation) and some very loud music. After creating my character, cringing a bit as the character posed to what sounded like 80's cartoon noises, I turned the music off. I then chose to join a game, and I got a list of gamemodes including "Murdermatch", "Murder the flag" and "YOLO Mode". As  â¢Ò NÎ£KÃ-Î± said in their review, putting Murder in the name of some gamemodes is not a good thing I mean, Murdermatch works but Murder the flag? Not so much. Anyway I tried to join a Murdermatch game and I got a little message saying "No Sessions Found" so I tried the next one but again, "No Sessions Found". I repeated this process until I finally found a server populated by 3 people in the "Zombie Survival Mode". I joined and I instantly got killed, so I respawned. Killed again. On the 5th respawn I was able to spawn away from the other players in a tiny room with a single way in and out so I sat there with a shotgun waiting for something to come past, at which point 2 or 3 zombies spawned in the room and killed me. The game then ended and I was booted back to the main menu so I sat for the next 10 minutes trying to find a server in other gamemodes. Eventually I found an Infection server, in which I spawned as a zombie so I started hunting down players, while also getting used to the controls as zombies have a weird grappling tentacle thing which worked for me 3 times out of 10. I came across a helicopter type vehicle which I could use, surprising that zombies can do that now a days, and killed quite a few people. It was actually fairly fun to fire all those rockets at the helpless players, that is of course until the chat came alive with angry 13 year olds and I was shot down by another one of the helicopter things, found myslef unable to do anything and eventually booted from the game. At this point I gave up, closed the game and only opened it up again to show it to friends and see what they thought.\n\nOverall, this is just another game with minecraft style visuals and guns, aimed at a younger audience so that it can sell (at least, thats what I thought playing it). While I don't at all doubt this was the "#1 rated Xbox Live Indie Game", on PC it is cluncky, there was nothing that explained how certain game elements worked, there were almost no servers so I still haven't been able to play some of the gamemodes and lastly it feels more like a F2P game than one that is being sold at Â£1.59 (79p during sales). Also the only things in the game that seem halo-inspired are the vehicles, some weapons and the health bar.","December 23, 2015","false","1.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

The one complaint I have is, why does the game say it has to send maps to other players even though it's a default map? It actually seems to cause lag when it pops up. Not only that, but when other players are lagging it seems to affect the rest of the players on the server. Is there any way to control what Region can play on your game? Just a thought. Outside of that, it was pretty fun to play. I don't know what to rate this really. Because it's not really a yes or a no for me, more like a maybe. Reason for this being the lag issues. Some maps are also non destructable. I think every map should, and you should be able to blow off parts of the map. That would be cool!\n\nAnyways, I'll give it a yes for now, but barely.","June 1, 2015","true","2.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/evilspiritsrdeath/recommended/274900/","evilspiritsrdeath","deathswagga","http://steamcommunity.com/id/evilspiritsrdeath/","400 products in account","This game is a fun voxel game on Steam at a very affordable price. I got this game in a bundle, and I mainly got the bundle just to get this game. I've played other voxel games like Ace of Spades, Guncraft and Blockstorm, so I was really happy to add this game to my library, and play it. My first impression were disappointingly negative, as when I tried to join servers, sometimes I would get kicked from them when I joined. And sometimes the host would choose a really bad map that they'd made and sometimes the respawning doesnt function correctly on such maps (i.e. spawning under the map and dying). Also once or twice there was a hacker using speedhacks (turbo shooting and lightning fast running) but they would get kicked. Apart from some particular people, this game is really enjoyable. When you find a decent server you can be playing for many hours straight. Its a great competitive game to play with your friends, and has really nice voxel graphics :) You get to choose 2 guns from a nice array whenever you respawn. The weapons are really nicely balanced, no gun feels under or over powered. The infection mode is nice, and works a bit like Ace of Spades' zombie mode. Because the game is voxel, you can place or even destroy blocks. This makes great dynamic battles, and allows you to bury yourself underground to hide. There are no AI zombies here, and I think that the zombies being able to kill you in one hit is rather unfair, and doesn't give you much of a chance. But if you are alert and teaming up, you have a much better chance and it is fun to hold off all the zombies. In zombies survival, you go up against 100's of zombies, and the first player to reach the pre-defined score set by the host, wins. This is also fun and competitive, but also unfair sometimes due to occasional spawning next to a few zombies which kill you and dont give you a chance to get away. The zombie AI could be improved slightly, and maybe zombies speed could be nerfed, but their health increased. Sometimes the zombies are frustratingly hard if theres no teamwork, so this is definitely great to play as co-op. This gamemode is still very fun to play alone or with friends, and is especially chaotic when theres millions of zombies and its exhilerating to try and hold them off and run away. The PvP gamemodes are quite fun, as there is almost zero lag, and everyone has a chance. There is also a great player customization and a recent update that added 3 new super-cool helmets. It's glad to see this game still recieves attention from the developer, and has a great fan-base. There is always lots of people playing, its never hard to find a server.\nOverall, this game is great to play in short bursts with friends, or even many hours straight till your fingers fall off. This game is highly addicting, and at the price of only $5, it's definitely a wise decision to purchase this game. Many hours of fun awaits you.","October 3, 2014","true","15.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","10"

This game. Crosses this line so much they broke it.

Pretty pathetic attempt at a rip off, not even the slightest bit subtle.","February 4, 2015","false","0.6"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","9","20","0","9"

The reviews for this game suggest that it is some sort of amazing FPS experience.  It is not a complex experience.  A bunch of people spawn on a map, and you run around with a couple weapons trying to kill eachother.  Some people talk about how this is very much not like minecraft.  I'll agree that the goal is very different from minecraft.  The graphics (obviously) are similar.  The digging and placing blocks is very similar to minecraft, and is an annoying addition to this game.  I felt like half the time I was digging around trying to find the last player on infection mode, because they had dug into a strange place where nobody could find them.  Perhaps they placed some blocks to make it even harder to get at them.\n\nThis game doesn't do anything seriously wrong.  However, it also doesn't have the degree of depth that I was expecting after reading the reviews and looking at the steam store page.  I'm not recommending mostly because of how I feel I was tricked into believing it was something it isn't.","October 8, 2014","false","1.3"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","2"

I notice there are no unlockables, making everybody equal. I pimp out my character and enter the game. I look around and find a useful, and easy to read, help section telling me most of the mechanics of the game. I hop on an infection server and boy, it was a lot more than I expected. Brilliant mechanics such as devouring and tentacles so I can pull myself around and get the jump on my armed human enemies. Unfortunately they keep killing me, as there's only one of me. So what do I do? I dig under them with my secondary attack. I get one of them and soon I'm on them with my new team-mates devouring all in site. "That was fun!". I then join a FFA server and have a great choice of weapons. From swords, to a halo-esque, to a shotgun which gives me camo. This game is not like any other, certainly not like Halo or Minecraft. The voxel-based system is purely to allow for easy mapmaking and movement; it works like a charm.\n\nTL;DR Brilliant game with great mechanics, gamemodes and weapons. Not just a copy of minecraft or halo.","November 12, 2014","true","16.4"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

However it has vehicules, ability to destroy maps, and zombies for some modes.\n\nThe main differentiator is the Infestation mode where you turn into a zombie once dead. Zombies cannot pick-up guns but come with their own weapons (claws and tongue). Overall, this is a fun mode.\n\nMain problem for me with the game is that the maps, while fun, are not well balanced. A lot of them are very open, which means that a sniper or someone flying high above with a vehicule can spam the map. You often see zombies coming from far away. There is an option to remove some weapon (e.g. sniper) so could potentially help, but it feels like a cheap trick.\n\nThe +\n--- Co-op editing\n--- Map variety - lots of them\n--- Zombie are fun to play once you understand weapons/leveleving up mechanics\n\nThe -\n--- Single player and co-op labels are misleading. The AI is too poor to really be single-player (zombie running toward you)\n--- Most map design are not well balanced\n--- Gameplay is straigt forward which is  a + but so simple it doesn't require much skills like quake/unreal for instance.\n\nI'd rate it 4 out of 10. There are better arena FPS alternatives on PC.","September 23, 2014","false","4.3"," 24 of 51 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","24","51","0","6"

Don't take this as harsh criticism, I'd still buy the game for the price they're asking for, but this game isn't meant for people to play for more than an hour at a time. This is one of those games where you can play for a bit before you burn out because this game burns out quickly unless you're with friends and even then, it can get tedious. It's a good game, but I can only say 7/10 because it's not really a game for time wasting, the genre makes it burn out quick, and the game tends to glitch out.","May 14","false","1.0"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","6"

The game's animations are absolutely attrocious, and have 2 or less keyframes at any given time. The game has no dedicated servers by the devs, and if they expected players to fill the gap, they were dead wrong.\n\nDo not get this game, it is not worth it, and quite frankly, is overpriced at $2 USD.\n\nOverwhelmingly Negative would not do this game justice.

So I see some rather good qualities on this game that are TOO OBSCURE to for Asia ( Clearly I know this area doesn't have any influence due to Xbox did not do well at all ) and Europe ( not sure how well halo did their ). I never played Halo at all, NEVER DUE TO! Where I live, no original xbox's sold well and Halo advertisements are not here...\n\nSo I had some hope with this game to be good, well I did not know what other fps design there is. There is the Halo.\n\nControls : It controls rather clunky due to lack of field of view, which cripples the game quite a bit depending what monitor you have, how far or how close you are. The control for me it is rather jagged due to short burts of energy and full runing. ._. Which makes it uncomfortable to control. Does not help with the annoying field of view.\n\nGraphics: Barely passable, the game has a rather limited amount of blocks, and most of them use GREY, BLACK, and BROWN. Or essentially " Ugly pallete ". It doesn't improve with the graphical settings if curious. Looks the same and well field of view issues.\n\nLevel Editor: Clunky 100% It feels rather unfinished it does not help. There is no way in the game to make simple block and place. It makes it a chore to build and delete blocks due to this. I wished the game atleast has some tips on how to build a map like. Use " ALT ( or B if controller ) with a sniper riffle to build with and other tools.\n\nGameplay : Just Halo with some level design. Varies on gamemodes, the gamemode that actually is fanastic in this game is the zombie based ones. The DM maps are pure UNHOLY PAIN TO PLAY! While TDM is rather okay, okay is not decent. CTF I mean Kill the flag, Uhhh. I mean Murder the Flag, yes I appreciate the effort, but no thanks.\n\nMusic: It is FANASTIC! The only perfectly scored part of the game in music. When launch.\n\n\nWhat could improve the game? A freaking field of view slider. Dang it, that would really help and level editor like this with map tips and such. Rather then being a generic mess. Actually MAKE THIS FULL OUT OPTIMIZED FOR THE COMPUTER DANG IT! Actually fix the sensetivity with a slider, not digits. Make it good for new comers.\n\nWhat would I give this? 3/10\n\nI had some fun, play it sometimes, it is just CRIPPLED on my lack of seeing the dark colors and field of view nightmare. It is too dang close... Just can't see the character models well due to too much black.\n\n\nWho would I recommend this to though? Who wants Halo with Blocks, thats all i have to say. The saddest thing is. THis game is not optimized for computer at all. Just a console game on PC.","October 21, 2014","false","55.2"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","8"
