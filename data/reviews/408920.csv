You are able to freely move your character around wherever you point and click, as long as they're not obstructed by obstacles.\nThe main questline seem to consist of you trying to protect and survive from the atrocity that lurks in the wasteland, which itself is rather straight forward, with apparent tasks such as bringing the fragile population to safety, join forces, pass information, etcetera.\n\nThe ingame currency is nuts, specifically screw nuts, as opposed to bottle caps in Fallout. These can be used for trading or paying for services, just as you'd expect. Each item you own has its value in nuts, and can be traded with most NPC in the game. Almost everyone that are non-hostile will have the ability to barter, where you can browse their belongings and eventually trade with them.\n\nOne thing that can be rather tedious for some players is that during the bartering there is no indication of the total amount of value in nuts, so you'll have to calculate the whole thing every time you barter.\nAlthough I feel this may be an early access condition and will likely be an implemented feature in time being.\n\nNow there's a strong emphasis on early Fallout games in aspect of this game development, Krai Mira isn't as unforgiving as Fallout were. In Fallout you'd have to think for yourself and try to explore the wasteland, find its paths and venture into the dangerzone. While Krai Mira has more of a hand-holding -esque to it, but not necessarily.\nFor instance, upon picking up a quest regarding the main questline, you'd be guided by large illuminating arrows showing you the paths between areas, as their exit tend to be in a specific point of the map. If you were given a task to head to a fort, you'd only be able to venture towards to the fort and encounter events in between. You cannot sidetrack or stray off, which prevents you from making any mistakes but also takes away your freedom of procrastination.\nIt might be worth to mention that there are mild nudity in the game such as topless women, who normally would be prostítutes. Those can exchange adult services for currency, and there'd be a potential side-quest given afterwards such as treasure hunting. The intercourse itself is not visible, the screen fades to black and you'd hear few moanings and then the screen becomes visible again.\n\nControlsOne of the interesting features in this game is that you can move around the camera freely as you please. The mouse wheel zooms in and out, and the zooming range is rather large. The right mouse button can be held down and dragged around to rotate the camera.\n\nThe movements feels awkward, the protagonist seem to slide around quite a bit, especially when you're taking a turn.\nTheir legs would be moving, but don't seem to have any impact on the ground, as if the surface is slippery. But again I believe this is yet another early access condition and may be reworked on as the development progress further.\n\nThe looting is very easy, as you hover over something interactive it'll indicate with a cogwheel beneath the cursor, upon clicking on it the protagonist will move towards it and crouch down to loot it. A looting table will show up and you'll have the ability to click on an item to directly place it in your inventory or press the take all button for your convenience. If the item consist of a stack, then clicking on it will open an amount field where there will be up and down arrows, to increase or decrease.\nThere are still no ability to justify the amount by typing it yourself as of now, unless I didn't struggle hard enough.\n\nCombatThe combat system is very clever I think, where your steps and attacks cost action points (AP), just like they did in Fallout. Despite the whole thing rules out in real-time, once a combat is activated, the environment would pause, until you have made your move. You get a highlighted line of sight striking between the protagonist and your mouse cursor, the further away you place your cursor the higher AP count will rise next to your cursor.\nThat way you'd know how much action points it'll cost you.\n\nClicking on an enemy will make you attack them, and the count of AP next to your cursor changes to enemy health during battle. The health indicator shows amount of health remaining out of max health. Every hit shows how much health is subtracted from the injured's health.\n\nUnfortunately there's a slight control issues, where clicking on a hostile unit may not always cause you to attack it, but rather confuse the game whether you want to attack the target or simply walk past them. Thus makes your character move past the target and lose action points for that reason. Which can be infuriating. This applies to aiming for anywhere but the torso.\nI think this could be solved if the target were highlighted in an outline each time you hover over them.\n\nDialogueNow this is one of the crucial aspect of the Fallout franchise, where the dialogue has a major impact on the game progression. Depending on your attitude and intelligence you can diverse the mission to a different scenario.\n\nIn Krai Mira the protagonist seems startled at all times. His responses are rather overreactive.\nThe protagonist doesn't seem someone who would be tough enough to survive in a wasteland, let alone to be a vigilante or a rebel.\n- I personally tend to be calm in real life and conversate in more of a withdrawn manner, whether it be a joke, argument, flirt or small talk.\nWhen playing a roleplaying game you'd want to connect yourself with your character, play yourself through them. I couldn't connect with my character as he was too melodramatic.\n\nThis might not be the most desired feature but I genuinely liked it in Fallout where I could select how my character would approach to someone. This helped to give our characters a personality to our likings.\nHopefully this may be reconsidered during future updates.\n\nThe NPC dialogue is rather vulgar, there's a lot of repetetive cuss words, but most of them seem to bring up sexual assault of some sort. F*cking here, f*cking there, you'll be ♥♥♥♥♥, she'll be ♥♥♥♥♥, this will be ♥♥♥♥♥, that will be ♥♥♥♥♥.\nSure it was probably fun for the first thirty seconds but then it quickly became dull and unimaginative.\n\nThere's some minor grammatical errors as well, but nothing too absurd, speech is spelled as speach, 'I' is rarely capitalized. It's just minor mistakes. Judging by the devs' responses, I trust that they are competent to correct these soon enough.\n\nVisuals and audioThe graphics is very fancy, and not too resource intensive, the screenshots does represent the ingame footage.\nThe audio consist of short soundtracks in repetetive loops. There are voices in the game though which is appreciating.\n\n\nThe verdictAll in all, it is indeed a playable game, and the equipment designs are appealing. The developers are actively communicating with the users in the Steam discussion and shows great passion in their game as of now and I'd say it has the potential to act as a substitute for Fallout 3: Van Buren.\nFallout 3: Van Buren was the original intended sequel of the Black Isle's franchise, before it was bought by Bethesda and the project got cancelled as Bethesda developed a different Fallout 3 of their own.","December 22, 2015","true","1.9"," 33 of 41 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","33","41","0","0"

There are moments we've almost all had as gamers where we get frustrated in a game, overthink everything and spend a ton of time looking for what we need to move on to the next level or progress the story.  - And then when we discover how simple it was we feel like a complete dope.  ..That's what happened with me in my initial review of this game, and it resulted in a negative score because I was so frustrated at the time.\n\nAfter a little bit of time however, I started realizing that there is actually a lot of this game that I really like.  So I reached out to one of the developers and decided to give the game another chance, realizing that this might all be on ME.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7JU7IyNjUc\n\nAnd in this video, a much more in-depth look at this game Krai Mira, you'll see exactly how foolish I was.  I MADE A MISTAKE AND MISSED SOMETHING SO OBVIOUS THAT EVEN A COMPLETE NON-GAMING NOOB WOULD SHAKE THEIR HEAD AT!   ...There, I said it.  It was all 100% on me.. and not this game.\n\nI have left my intial review and video at the bottom of this review, just so you all can see how drastic my overall first review is now that I discovered what a goober I was in my first play.  It might give someone a good laugh anyhow.\n\nSo what is Krai Mira?\n\nIt's a pretty damn good looking turn based RPG adventure game made in the shadows of the original Fallout PC games.  ..I mean the original old school Fallout games from the 90s, don't be thinking Fallout 3 or Fallout Vegas or you might be left disappointed by the isometric perspective and graphics.\n\nIt offers stats, special skills which can be upgraded as you choose as you level up.  It offers an inventory system and plenty of people willing to trade with you, as long as you give them enough items to suit their desires.  You can pretty much barter with any NPC and you'll see lots of them, and each one carries different items for trade.\n\nMost NPCs will also offer you the ability to play a game of Dice where you take turns rolling 5 dice to score the results in a very Farkle scoring system.  Don't worry if you are not familiar with the dice game of Farkle, as the dice rolling screen shows you a clear dice scoring chart.  This is a game of double or nothing as the winner takes all at whatever score point you decide to play to.  And this game is where my biggest suggestion goes out to the developers...  You have your dice rolling system in place.  You have the scoring in.  Now just make it a small game of "Farkle" where dice can be rolled and you can choose to gamble further for more points or risk losing all your turn points to roll again.  Basically my suggestion is to change the current single dice rolls and 100% luck game to a game of Farkle where strategy and skll will be part of your dice game gamble.  I think that this upgrade alone would take this game from a "good game" to a "fantastic game" that would also be much more addicting!\n\nThe turn based combat system is a lot of fun already and I love how while it shows your entire move area when you in a battle, it doesn't show you the move grids like so many of these games do.  Please watch my video for a better idea of how it all work.\n\nMature Content Warning: You'll see a lot of curse words in the text dialogues and options of how to respond, especially the F-bomb.  You'll also see naked women and lots of sexual innuendo!  - This may be a positive for some people however!  ;-)\n\nSo now this game has taken a huge turn after more time playing, and I actually scored this game at an 84%  (Value: 34/40, Fun 25/30, Controls & Bugs 17/20, Graphics and Sound 8/10)\n\nAn 84% is a VERY high and respectable score for a game like this that is still in early access right after the EA launch!\n\nDefinitely recommended especially to any RPG game, Fallout, or apocolyptic style games!\n\n\n**********************  ORIGINAL FLAWED REVIEW:  ************************\n\nYeck.  I really wanted to like this game...\n\nThe game seemed okay at first.  It felt a little unfriendly and without a proper idea of what to do, where to go, or why as there is no beginning cut scene or even text giving you a clue what's going on.\n\nThe game drops you into an area, and you need to search the entire map area for clues.  You talk to npcs but if you say the wrong thing to the wrong guy, you're in for an un-winnable fight.  Got it.\n\nFirst off, let's talk about what I DID like about the game...  The graphics are well done, as are the animations.  Blood spews realistically when a character is hit in battle.  A nice dramatic music is engaged when battles occur, love that as well!  Another thing I loved was that when you enter a battle (which is turn based) there is no grid typical of these games that shows up, but instead just a blue circular area which shows you your movement range.  The whole combat process itself is by far the best part of this game and is actually both fun and rewarding.\n\nAnd I was enjoying this game quite a lot until I got to the little town with the train ride available for "100 nuts". (nuts is money in this game)  I tried fighting that dude because he wouldn't consider giving me the needed train ride for less.  That ended in the quick death (impossible fight) of me and my two fellow npc friends on my team.\n\nSo after respawning, I tried paying the guy his 100 nuts.  Then there was no way to actually take the train ride I had paid for that I could find.  I searched the enitre area three times, talked to every character, and clicked on every clickable item.  (Items that are searchable or usable show a gear icon when you hover over them)\n\nIn the end, this was a rather quick refund for me.  I don't want to spend my hard earned money aimlessly walking around a map area five times trying to figure out how to progess the game onward.  I don't want to pay to be frustrated trying to figure out poorly designed levels, early access or not.\n\nSorry developers, it looks like your game might be pretty good with some more work, but right now I simply cannot recommend this game to anyone unless they just want to pay you money to help you design your game better.  I'm sure you'll point out something that I missed to move on from where I got stuck, but that isn't the kind of puzzle that I think is fun in a game.  I want progession that isn't overly obvious, but also not so complicated or hidden that I wander around for twenty minutes going WTF.","October 9, 2015","true","2.4"," 45 of 65 people (69%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","69","45","65","5","5"

A REAL HONEST REVIEW requires hours of actual testing different mechanics which require you to progress in game to be able to give an honest review!I will start out by saying I have been alpha, beta testing for over 25 years before it was a market ploy to sell games, and have worked for companies doing so in the past and used to make skins and maps for some really old games Like Quake, Quake 2 and Heretic II and mods for original NWN and I may be a little more picky then most players who are just gamers and don’t really know how to truly test a game. Many reviews done on steam have little or no actual testing or reviewing done before posting a Good or Bad review.\n\nThis game although its not really ready to be sold, let me STRESS THIS to normal players!!! This game is worthy of purchasing by people who go in knowing all of these problems exsist and it will be a worthy redition of original fallout 1 and 2 which were AMAZING games and still are albeit old school.\n\nTHIS BEING SAID, is why I give it a thumbs UP its worth supporting!!! NOT because its ready for normal unhindered/unproblematic gameplay!!\nITS FUN in its current state, but very frustrating when you lose game data if you dont know how to use the hex and decimal system they use for grabbing your data from your character to pass it to a new game character file.\n\nTHIS GAME REQUIRES A LOT OF TESTING STILL AND PATCHING!! SO BE WARNED!!!THIS GAME REQUIRES A LOT OF TESTING STILL AND PATCHING!! SO BE WARNED!!!THIS GAME REQUIRES A LOT OF TESTING STILL AND PATCHING!! SO BE WARNED!!!THIS GAME REQUIRES A LOT OF TESTING STILL AND PATCHING!! SO BE WARNED!!!\nIntroductionThe game is set in a post apocalyptic world, and you start in a small fishing village named Quiet Bay, and here your journey starts with the warning of Taurs washing over the wasteland cannibalizing all the villages they come into contact with and you being given the starting quest of warning your village, the story expands from here. Some based on storyline some based on your choices.\n\nCurrencyThe currency in game is "Nuts" (Bolts for screws) There is Gambling in game slot machines, Blackjack Card tables, Dice Gambling with most of the NPCs you meet to take their money through gambling or lose yours.\n\nItems diversityThe items in game are the exact same style as Fallout some simple weapons and armor modified from junk turned into useable weapons and armor others seem to be real Para-military style weapons and armor and help make the game interesting having both. Seems to have a moderate amount of items right now, very much hoping they will add a lot more before releasing.\n\nCombat SystemThe combat system is Action Points just like old school Fallout style games, but there is a real time system in game but combat remains turn based even when turned on.  Seems on par.\n\nLoot and findable Container system The looting system requires the player to actually scour the map by looking for containers or items hidden on the map and mouse over before they know if the item can be searched or not. Personally I like this since it makes it harder to find stashes but some may not feel the same.\n\nMovement Mechanics The movement in game is classic point and click to move like in original fallout, diablo etc many other games. you can mouse wheel to zoom way out or way in closer to your character .\n\nNO Crafting Mechanics in game yet haven’t heard of any to come\nSocial Reputation System Based on actions (Good Evil Karma choices/Stealing getting caught) and purchases in towns/villages\n\nShops and inventory All inventory including barter on NPCs is reset right now each time you leave the zone and come back can be exploited is not time based. Also reputation helps some with prices buying/selling\n\nPros & ConsThe game has some inexperienced developers but seem to be trying hard to answer players concerns, this game will be a wonderful rendition of the old Original Fallout and the game is fun except for the catastrophic game crashes, errors and game save file problems that pester it at the present time.\nDeveloper stated they are working on save/load function this will help resolve a lot of players problems  with losing saves/data right now. I do think and hope the devs would find a way to put out patches a little faster, even if small ones to let the community know they are still working hard.\n\n\nThis game right now has only auto save and from what I can find it doesn’t even make a backup or keep your previous couple of game saves which is game development 101 from 20 years ago.\nAlso the game saves you only when you zone and it has a tendency to move your spawn point to a location where you are trapped and can’t do anything but start over.\nYou can’t save the game auto saves and it has a extremely poor auto save system for the time being.(Again this is being addressed with the next patch they hope) Even fallout almost 2 decades ago had a game save load system so you could backup your save with multiple saves for redundancy or revert to a previous save so you don’t lose everything.\n\nSomething I am very avid about is not having to start over after time spent on a game I buy, because of a failure with the way the game is designed or a mechanic. Redundancy with auto save system and giving the players the open to backup previous saves is just a normal thing to do with a game now days and has been for over 20 years.\n\n\nGambling Issues Let me say the betting on tables and slots is extremely tedious since you have to click everytime in increments of 10 so when you want to bet a lot you have to click A LOT instead of clicking in the window and typing your amount like you can do with buying from people in bartering. HOPE this gets a FIX!\n\nThe gambling mechanics with the card tables has serious bugs that allow the player to get super rich at the start of the game so you can pretty much buy whatever you want, doesnt involve cheating but more a calculation and reward issue that can override the daily dealers max money amount. Also there is a bug in game if you bet all your money leaving you "ZERO" "0" in reserve if you win it will not reward you and steal all your money. So always leave atleast a single nut in your bag when betting.\n\nThe slot machine gambling seems to be pretty solid except needing more filler dials to reduce the chance of winning or just the amount you can win without a jackpot. Even jackpots are kinda easy to get if you have a few thousand you can empty all the machines out just due to mathmatical probabilities are in your favor to hit the jackpot due to limited placeholder dial positions in the slot.\n\nUNLESS you just want to SUPPORT the company in development, which I think this game is worthy of but dont expect a game you can play through fully right now until some things are worked out this game is not ready for normal sales (IN my OPINON and that doesnt mean listing it as Early Access as an excuse)\n\nSupport the developers!At this time I definitely wouldn't recommend spend any money on this title to "everyone" but if  you want to support the developers in this worthy cause and understand this is a work in progress!\n\nIf you appreciated the review please remember to vote thumbs up!\nUPDATE 6/4/2016\nDeveloper has resolved the gambling bug that zeros out and steals all your money if you do a all in bet.","May 10","true","42.9"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","4"

This is very much like the older fallout games where you can free roam until you encounter an enemy, then it switches to a tactical mode. There is a decent mix of weapons, and the leveling system is easy to use. The random encounters are fun and range in difficulty.\n\nSome of the map is hard to navigate, if somebody dies on a bridge they fall into the water (un lootable) or if they die in a doorway you can't loot them. Getting a group togethe seems to be random or maybe I just haven't found a mercenary yet (currently lost my original group when I took a job, now have just a dog I found at the start point). Slight translation/grammar issues, lootable chests are hard to notice or there are none.\n\nOne BIG issue is the inability to save. You can only load from the last auto save. I dont really enjoy this part at all and hope it gets fixed immediately.\n\nOverall I have enjoyed the game thus far and will continue playing.
