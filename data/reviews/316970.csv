I was the first player to write a negative Steam review of The Waste Land (in September of 2014). My review was sincerely critical of the game's glaring flaws, and the Italian developer, Fledermaus, had his friends in Italy follow and attack me everywhere they could on Steam for about a month.\n\nWhen I posted my original review, within one day my review was swamped with about a dozen childish insults written in broken English by various degenerates living in Italy. Sure enough, these were Fledermaus's lackeys coming to aid him. In the first 24-hour period, my Steam review of The Wasteland had 19 downvotes, 2 upvotes, and comments like "Gues ur wrong!", "If it is bad why is youre review so hated.", "Try righting a rel review."\n\nIt didn't stop there. Almost daily I was getting harassed with insults from random Italians on my public Steam profile. I got fed up with the attention, so I took the review down, especially seeing as how the indie game was already an enormous financial failure.\n\nComments still trickled in on my profile for a couple days, with stuff like "Why you take the review down?", "Upset cuz your review suks?" before finally stopping.\n\nHopefully next time Fledermaus makes a game, he will focus less on attacking his customers, and focus more on making a fun game.\n\n==THE NEW REVIEW==\nThe Waste Land is an awful game that should not be played.  I spent over 12 hours in The Waste Land, wasting my time 100%'ing the game just to dispel any notion that I misunderstood the game.  Never have I been so bored exploring a metroid-style game.  The environments are unnecessarily gigantic and empty. The whole game world takes about 40-minutes to traverse end-to-end, and yet it still feels stripped of content. The monsters sprinkled across the game are pathetic and easy to avoid, and the lack of any coherent level design makes the whole game feel like a bloated, disorganized mess. The only aspect of the game that is not horribly inadequate is the outdoor visual design. Unfortunately, the crudely drawn enemy sprites negate the effect that the environment backgrounds create.\n\nI would also like to point out that the game contains random acts of sex, prostitution, nudity, and implied ♥♥♥♥. In the game world, you are the king of the land, and you are entitled to free sex in any of this sad kingdom's brothels. This is all offered without any context or reason, so it comes across as randomly shoved into the game as poor fan-service. The girls aren't even pretty.","October 8, 2015","false","12.6"," 140 of 148 people (95%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","95","140","148","14","15"

Unfortunately it fails in many ways to capture the magic and squanders its potential as a metroidvania.   As someone who has played almost every Metroidvania on Steam, I can't recommend this game for a variety of reasons.\n\nWhile the graphics are a throwback to the old NES era, the audio in this game is horrendous.   The music is bland and repetitive, and the sound is overall lackluster.   I found myself having to mute the game completely and play my own music to make the experience tolerable.\n\nThe world itself is very large and expansive, but about 75% of it is just boring flat space with monsters that you will find yourself just jumping over 90% of the time.   There is no incentive to fight them monsters since ther is no leveling system, or currency to spend at the towns for upgrades.   This reduces them to avoidable speedbumps (except the annoying plants).  The towns themselves are a nice break from the bland emptiness of the games overworld, but then you realize that the NPC's have nothing of value to say.   There are no shops, but there are brothels that are good for a laugh the first time you go to one.\n\nThe upgrades are almost completely useless.  Only 2 of them actually open new areas, and one of them you find a few minutes into the game, the other is hidden in a silly spot that I won't spoil.  Most of the bosses could even be skipped because they are not blocking your path to progress in any way, nor do they reward you with game changing powerups.\n\nThere is also no fast travel, which makes traversing the games boring landscape even more tedious.   You would think there would be at least one spot in each country you could warp to after visiting once, but instead I spent probably over half of my 10 hours playing this walking to the left or right, jumping over monsters, across empty screens devoid of any real platforming.\n\nOverall skip this game, there are much better metroidvanias on steam.","September 22, 2014","false","10.0"," 109 of 129 people (84%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","84","109","129","4","4"

That isn't the case with The Waste Land.

The game's myriad flaws discouraged me from putting much time into it: the enemies blend in with the background, the hitboxes are tremendously inaccurate, and the fall damage mechanic is completely broken. You gain access to a double jump fairly early on, and one would think that you could use it to survive long falls. This is not the case; when you perform your midair jump at any given point in a long fall, you still take damage based on how long you fell before you performed the second jump. Stupid.\n\nWhile the concept is pretty cool (and, to my knowledge, unexplored outside of this game), the world it takes place in is not. There are a ton of pointless NPC's and vast stretches of empty space. A good portion of my 1.8 hours with this game was spent wandering the expanse trying to get from point A to point B. There's a map, but it's not terribly helpful, as it's presented from a top-down perspective whereas you can only move left and right.\n\nI really wanted to like this game, but I just couldn't. There is a lot of potential here for something good. If the developers were to fix the hitboxes, clean up the backgrounds, and cut down on the extraneous sections of the map, I could forgive it of its other flaws and get some enjoyment out of it. As it stands, though, it's just too broken to be fun.","April 26, 2015","false","1.8"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","19","24","0","0"

"The Waste Land" could have been an incredible game but suffers from many flaws marking it as an amateurish attempt of recreating the lost days of exploring cryptic 8bit worlds.\nBasically, the majority of your time in this game is you aimlessly wandering around a gigantic map with a whole bunch of locations looking for: you never know what!\n\nThat is the main flaw of the game, you are constantly lost and maybe stumble upon a clue where to go next. Now, exploring (2D) worlds can be pretty fun but the key to make that work for me is a) variety in locations and monsters and some kind of logic in how areas are laid out b) impressive landmarks and c) artifacts and treasures to motivate me to go looking around some more.\n\nUnfortunately, the world of "The Waste Land" is too empty to keep my interest going - there are way too many areas that are simply filler, ultimately adding to tedium because you need to traverse these areas (sometimes more than once) since there is no fast travel at all. There is very little indication where to go next, and folk in this game are mostly very vague with their hints.   Exploration simply doesn't feel rewarding enough, thanks to the bland visuals and only 10 weapon-upgrades and 20 health-upgrades hidden in the various lands. Every now and then, the game does something cool - like showing a gigantic moon in the background or being able to see a particularly important tower in the background of another stage. These little details rock, but they are very rare. The rest is spent double-jumping over most enemies and getting to the left or right side of a stage. There is hardly any noteworthy platforming in between.\n\nAnother issue is the fact that the game throws tons of enemies at you (I killed several thousand during my playthrough) but they are neither interesting to fight nor do you gain anything from killing them but the occasionally health pick-up that becomes pretty much obsolete once you have enough health-upgrades to last long enough to make it from one checkpoint to another (checkpoints restore you to 100%).\n\nCombat mechanics are pretty terrible, hitdetection is iffy and the invincibility-phase you have after getting it doesn't work properly. You can get hit multiple times at once, even though you are blinking. What is worse is that you also loose control over your character and get a significan knockback effect. This makes the final boss fight a complete and total ♥♥♥♥ing pain in the ♥♥♥ (I would actually call that p.o.s. broken as ♥♥♥♥) - because as you get knocked back you also get caught again and suffer a second (and third, maybe even a fourth hit without being able to do anything about it). Movement itself does feel rather tight though.\n\nBut, I got to admit - the game isn't a complete failure and every now and then there are some bits that are both interesting and somewhat exciting. 3 out of 5 boss battles are actually pretty cool and atmospheric. Some places even tell a little stories, I really liked the sealed mine shafts - there was a nice build-up by the towns folk in the mining town, telling me of ancient artifacts and people dying in the mine and then I got a chance to descend into that unholy place myself. Whenever the game gives a bit of a narrative to a location, it suddenly becomes much more interesting as soon as you have some context about the surroundings you are in. There are some genuinely cool places to discover, and my imagination kicked in several times playing this - it is a real shame the game didn't keep this level and instead went for the "filler"-areas.\n\nOne word about the atmosphere, even though the music tries really hard to ruin the mood 80% of the time, the bleakness and hopelessness  dripping from every pore of "The Waste Land" is very much to my liking. Not so cool are the ridiculous death animations - because they look like someones first attempts in MSPaint = horrible!\n\nStill, the few good & atmospheric moments don't justify the horrible and glitchy tech or the lack of any meaningful structure to the way you traverse and interact with the surroundings. There is potential here, but it is also an amateur project through and through and that holds it back tremendously.\n","September 22, 2014","false","7.6"," 27 of 44 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","27","44","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/316970/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","The Waste Land shouldn’t be confused with InXile’s Wasteland games. The Wasteland games are RPGs whereas The Waste Land is a 2D action adventure with gameplay similar to the traditional Castlevania and Metroid games. I’ve played plenty of Metroidvania games in my life, so I was willing to give it a try and see if it’s anything like those revolutionary games.\n\nIn this game you control a king who kills a strange looking beast in the very beginning of the game. By killing this innocent creature all kinds of weird and evil creatures are now released into the world of the living. It’s up to you to right your wrongs.\nApart from a short tutorial you’re dropped into the game without any backstory or further information. In fact, the story starts with you picking up your sword and killing the creature. After that, you’re on your way. Where to ? No one knows. This is also one of its main problems.\nAlthough you have a map in your possession you can only use it to see all the places you can go to. There’s no fast travel and there are no objectives or destinations listed on it. Which makes exploring mandatory, but also a tedious, boring task. You’ll walk a lot from left to right, even up and down, and every so often you’ll find a savepoint where you can, naturally, save your game. A lot of times you’ll just get to a certain point only to found out that you can’t continue because you literally can’t go any further or because you don’t have the right tools to progress. So you’ll have to backtrack to another location and hope that there is something there that can help you on your way. This is the general idea behind Metroidvania games, by the way; to find better equipment so you can go back and progress where you previously couldn’t. But one thing’s for sure, this isn’t fun. It would’ve been much better if there was just a way to fast travel to places you’ve already visited. A missed opportunity.\nIn the beginning of the game you’ll have just your basic sword to combat enemies and later on you’ll find better and other weapons (like your bow), and even new abilities and items. Fighting enemies seems fun, especially in the beginning, but every time you reenter an area the enemies will have respawned. Most of the enemies aren’t killed by one hit so they usually all need a couple of hits before they die. After fighting the same enemy for the 10th time or so you’ll grow bored by it and you’ll just try to jump over them. This becomes easier to do once you have the ability to double jump. I don’t think this could’ve been the developer’s intention but I think it’s what most people will do anyway. There’s no real incentive to kill enemies because you won’t gain any experience or items from them except for randomly dropped (poisoned) food. The first and only boss fight I came across with also didn’t provide me with enough challenge which consisted of hitting and running, hitting and running. Yet another missed opportunity, in both cases.\nThings the game does right are the atmosphere. It’s absolutely clear that you’re dealing with a wasteland here. Except for some small villages there doesn’t seem to be anything else and of all it is deserted. Another thing is the secrets, which are usually well hidden. These secret items will upgrade your health and boost stats, but as I said, good luck finding (a way to get to) them.\n\nAs far as the graphics are concerned; there are a lot of browns and greens in them. The game has a bleak look and a depressing atmosphere. The enemy designs are very good and they’re animated pretty well. The environments are mostly static backgrounds and most of it fits together, except for the stairs which look weird in contrast.\nI have nothing to complain about the music, which is good, and - you could probably already tell - there’s no voice acting in it. The sounds characters make aren’t spectacular in any way but they get the job done, which is all that it needs.\n\nI’m sorry to say that The Waste Land hasn’t become the legendary Metroidvania game I wish it would be; there are better games out there, but it’s enjoyable if you like (tough) games with no handholding. I don’t agree with some of the design choices, but thankfully for the developer those things are not for me to decide. I do hope some of my feedback will be addressed, however. If not for me then at least for other potential and future buyers. For now I would think of The Waste Land as an average game.\n\n[Rating: 70/100]","September 28, 2014","true","7.7"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","14","22","0","0"

Many had poor level design, poor gameplay, poor difficulty curve... but we still played these as kids, because that was all we knew, and thought it was great! This game is about that.

It has some great atmosphere, with dashes of Vampire Hunter D and Miyazaki's Nausicaa, but it gets really tiresome in spots.  The problem is that there is too much featureless open space (save the cool background graphics) between location nodes and no fast travel, so you walk and walk and walk and walk before you get to the next important quest -- and lord help you if you get off of the beaten path!  It may take nearly an hour to get back on the right track again.\n\nThe story is pretty cool, though, and most of the boss battles are pretty neat.  Developer Fledermaus obviously has no problem whatsoever cooking up great game assets or scenarios; they just need to concentrate on improving their level design.  If they keep that in mind for their next game, It is sure to be an unqualified winner.\n\n(Interestingly enough, though many parts of the game were tryingly tedious when I just simply sat on the couch and played, my one-hour stationary bike sessions blazed by ultra-quick, quicker than when I play more exciting games.  Yeah, a real funny feeling of time dilation . . .

There are exactly two upgrades that allow you to backtrack and get stuff you couldn't acquire before. For some people that might be enough. For me, it seems as if there wasn't enough depth planned.\n\nOn the idea of depth, the lesser NPCs hardly have any individuality, and very few give "quests" if they can even be called that. To get one heart upgrade one must "Speak" with all the people in a particular area with absolutely no idea that this is something necessary. This happens perhaps twice in the game, with no real warning that you were actually assigned a quest.\n\nWhile the world is an interesting and there was definitely loving care put into designing the world, what populates it is yet again, minimal. Travelling from the snowwy wastes to the desert, there are hardly any different enemies. There might be if I think about it, perhaps somewhere between 30-35 distinct enemies. Maybe. And you fight these enemies over and over and over and over..... Which wouldn't be such a problem except.... You really don't get anything out of it. Well, you might get a heal item... or a rotten heal item.\n\nIf there were more items to get than hearts, swords, and different arrows, I might not mind the lack of XP, coins, something to collect and make the grind feel good. As it is, I got to the point where I was specifically avoiding enemies because it just took too long, and I wasn't going to get anything out of it anyways.\n\nThe problem is the world is HUGE and so you go from zone to zone fighting so many of the same enemies. I would recommend using a guide, because there is about 5% help telling you where you should go next if at all. On top of that, depending on what zone you are in, the music drones on and on and is short, looping and making you wish you could stab yourself in the ear. The first time you hear it, it's awesome; 5 mins later when you've heard the same refrain for the 7th time, you want to kill the game.\n\nDespite all this it is fun to play. The story is quite fascinating and I'm glad a game was developed around this. The progression of the protaginist throughout the game seems a little forced, but setting aside your disbelief one can follow along and enjoy the game. The mechanics are relatively simple, but familiar, but there are still challenges to be hand. However, occasionally the controls "stick" is about as best as I can describe it.\n\nI would recommend getting this game on sale for at least 50% off, as it is worth an easy $5.\n\n6/10 - Even with all it's faults, it is definitely worth playing. Just know what you're getting into.","August 31, 2015","true","15.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Also, The Wasteland did "well" at combining Metroid like items or equipment with a Castelvania open world, if you can remember back to Simon's Quest. I also appreciated the little pun on choosing level of difficulty. Difficulty selection philosophically points at how older games are better at challenging players. Finally, the credits were done in an interesting way too.\n\nHowever, there are enough reasons I cannot recommend purchasing this game. I won't go into the particulars, but the main one is that I imagined a retro open world would have had more substance. Retro City Rampage already paved the Retro open world and any indie developers must ask what can we do equal or better? Next, what is going on in this story? By that I mean the NPCs were either too vague or they were pointless. I went into a town, okay now what? I went into the woods and there were creatures who attack me and now what? There didn't seem to be any reason to kill anything aside from seeing it die, which is interesting, but it invokes no plot. Also, I am wary of having to traverse a big open world. Lets rephrase that, a big seemingly empty-ish open world. It's well designed from the looks of it and with a very cool overland map, but not much makes me want to visit the locations on it. It seems logical that there may be an item that allows a player to fast travel, or perhaps a Mario Brother style warp spot. However, without some reassurance I am not drawn into the story enough to find out. Perhaps NPC townies could illustrate what kind of interesting items we will be able to find; it's not like they are doing much else. Perhaps NPCs could do things we didn't see in the 1980s such as they could change the PC's appearance. Or maybe they do that later in the game but there isn't much driving me to find out. Do the NPCS ever attack the player? Do they ever attack each other? They certainly have sex with the player which is cool. I would liked to have seen a 12 bit Witcher style cut scene of my player in the brothel, but maybe that's beyond the budget. Perhaps NPCs serve a greater purpose and I haven't unlocked this yet? However, what is it that is compelling me to find out? What would compel a player to explore this really awesome open word universe? If the player's answer is: I'm going to have to put some more painful hours in so I can find out. Then maybe some fundamental concepts should be adjusted or redrawn.","September 17, 2014","false","4.8"," 17 of 37 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","17","37","0","0"

Even if I really enjoyed playing it, and would recomend it warmly, I understand lots of people would not. Indeed, this atmospheric matroidvanian game has lots of pros and cons, that i am going to summerize below.\n\nFirst, the cons:The game is real hard, and the dificulty is not allways well ballanced. As the game is open world with really few indications, u can easly take the wrong turn and end repetivelly dying against small beasts or gigantic deamons alike.Some boss are just Far too long to fight. It would have been beter if the life of both the hero and his foes could be divided by two.\nPlus, like in most metroidvanians, you can end up totaly lost and need to look up on the internet to know what is next.\nFinaly, it is pixel art. I know many people wont like it.\n\nThen, the Pros:The gameplay is mostly good. It is actually a greate metroidvania, with a gigantic open world to exlore and lots of secrets to find. The enemies can somtimes become repetitive, but in most place they are a real interesting chalenge. And the bosses are well desined and interesting to fight.\nThe Scenario of the game is well thought, intresting and mysterious, and most of all the universe has a greate well imagined background. As it is an open world, You will be able to travell across your kingdom in many environement complexs and interestings, with severals strange cityes with each an esthetics and somme back stories.\nFinaly, the atmosphere is Awsomme. As you are arpenting the kingdom you doomed, both the musics and the graphics will help you feel the an embiant sadnnes. I particulary apreciated the gigantic landscapes you can see in the north, with pines forests and snowy peaks.\n\nSo to conclude, I would totally recomend that game I liked , mostly because of its ambience and scenario. Even if the gameplay is not perfect, i really liked its chalanging simplicity. It is original, unusual, but somhow disturbingly brillant. Ad absolutelt unique. Buy it on the next deal!\n\n","November 15, 2015","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The "exploration" aspect that most of the time ended you in massive enemy-filled dead-end. After all, this is an indie game and the core combat was somewhat solid.\n\nAnd then I reached the end.

Combat is largely a jumping straight up in the air, seeing if an enemy enters the range of your sword, maybe scoring a hit, then repositioning and jumping straight up in the air. An initial frustration with the tiny hit area of your starting weapon gives way to boredom once you learn the patterns of the three or four enemy types (in the opening stages), at which point everything becomes a slog.\n\nA perfect example: There is this terrifying, gigantic fire-breathing zombie dog that is maybe seven or eight times the size of your character. You walk up to and go "oh man, I am gonna get wrecked by that." After one such encounter, you will have discovered the completely foolproof strategy for defeating it, which is to stand perfectly still and mash the stab button in order to stun lock it until you hit five times. (This does not take precise timing, and because of invincibility frames, this takes a solid four or five seconds. That sounds like a ridiculous complaint, but the time spent standing there just ruins any sense of fluidity or rhythm.)\n\nIt's one thing to ask you to grind through enemies that are more annoying than challenging, but there doesn't seem to be any reason behind the grind. There's no experience or money or anything like that. The only thing that enemies drop is food that restores HP that you lost to other enemies you didn't have any reason to fight. They're just an impediment, which is so much worst in an exploration-heavy game that has you clearing the same screens several times in order to make progress.\n\nOh and the music that plays through the opening areas is just awful and repetitive and somehow both droning and intrusive, yet it goes on forever without variation.\n\nAgain, gorgeous game. Lots of beautiful grace notes (there's a brief character moment in the cathedral that isn't to be missed), and maybe for you there's an 8-bit nostalgia factor. I wish I wanted to finish this.","April 29","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Games that didn't hold my hand to get me through the game but made me think about how to get through an area.   I'll admit that I have gotten to a point (Fighting the whale) and after many trys have gotten a bit frustrated.  But in all honesty I think I have overreached and need to explore a bit more and find something!   The game has dark tones but the fodder design (Killing Giant Slugs and Tortoise) is a bit lame!\n\nI Bought this around the same time as I bought Shovel Knight and have had coversations about which is better and my argument has always been that even though they are both good, it's like comparing Mario to Castlvania 2 Simons Quest!\n\nIf you like games and gaming you may like this!  If you are a Gamer and want a Pre Metroidvania style challenge I'd recommed this!","May 11","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
