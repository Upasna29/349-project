Shoot the legs, that'll disable and/or slow them down. Shoot the head? instant kill. There's lung-shots, heart shots and much more. The animals can also bleed out! Sometimes you even have to put them down...\n\n- A truckload of already-available guns for you to use in your leisure.\n\n- Heavily customisable maps, weather, types of animals that spawn, and more!\n\n- Tents to hide away in! Enough said.\n\n- Would make a good game if it was ported to mobile/tablet devices.\n\n- Bullet-cam options!\n\nCons:\n\n- Minor bugs, though they shouldn't really have too much effect on the game, mostly AI-related. Nothing serious like crashing or resolution errors. They actually make the game a bit easier at times! This can be a good or bad thing, depending on the person. The animals running around endlessly in a circle is a notable bug.\n\n- Graphics are a bit dated. Though those who really want to play the game are probably going look past it. Think a "late-2000's era budget game" graphic style.\n\n- This may only be a problem for, or only be noticed by a handful of players, but the profile name text input bar is controlled by the left and right keys. Not a very popular UI design to some.\n\n- Vehicle controls (horse and quad bike)\n\n\nIn short, if you enjoy hidden gems like these, I'd say give it a try. I reckon it's an 8.5/10.","August 2, 2014","true","9.4"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","0"

Various locations around the world are available, as well as various types of prey such as; Deer, Elk, Bear, Lions, Elephants, and more. I, myself enjoyed the simulated hunt in the Northeastern United States with a 30-30 Winchester Lever action, which also happens to be the same type of rifle I own and have hunted with in real life. Various scents, lures, blinds, and more are available to help you in your hunt, as well as an array of various weapon types from Rifles to Crossbows, designed to let you make your simulated hunting experience unique to your style.\n\nI have played hunting simulators in the past and this one ranks up top with the better ones, for its realistic feel and approach. The landscapes are varied and immersive, the ambient noises are a nice touch and the graphics, while not great, aren't so bad  you can't enjoy the game. If you enjoy realistic hunting simulator experiences, I would recommend this over one of those Cabela's Hunting games any day.","July 22, 2015","true","0.4"," 19 of 27 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","19","27","0","0"

On the surface it may look like a simple, boring game where you spend ages walking around ugly scenery trying to find a specific animal, like a video game in which one searches for a needle in a haystack the size of a planet, BUT THIS IS NOT THE CASE!!!!\n\nThis game is really an epic story of love, betrayal, retribution as well as deer slaughter.  The main character is actually a deep well thought out character who's constant silence is reflective of the inner turmoil within his very soul, who's feelings are expressed subtely and beautifully in his every step and every slight shake of his constant companion - his gun.  This story is expressed through a series of well thought out missions in which the player has to accomplish goals as part of his quest through the in depth world in which this epic is set.\n\nI cannot recommend this game highly enough, it is so good it is the last game you'll ever need to buy with it's never ending replayability. 10/10","December 27, 2011","true","1.2"," 24 of 37 people (65%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","65","24","37","22","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ietsocat/recommended/12690/","ietsocat","ietso","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ietsocat/","394 products in account","It was 82 degrees on the afternoon of October 10th, 2011. I was debating if I should go out deer hunting or not. There was a particular stand set that my friend Dave and I hung in June that I had not been to yet this season. Most of the times the wind was not right or it rained and I did not feel like getting wet. I don't like the heat either but I knew cooler weather will be coming in the near future. I still had to attach a pull rope to this stand because I forgot to when my friend Dave and I put the stand up. Even though it was pretty warm out and it is still early in the season the wind was perfect for this stand setup. We had an east wind.\n\nI decided to go. I jumped in the shower and used my unscented and bacteria killing soap. Then I got dressed and sprayed down each layer of clothing. I drove out to my hunting spot and sprayed down my outer layer of clothing quite liberally. I have always wanted to put a stand in this spot over the years but never have due to the walking distance. I know the big boys are in here but I just didn't want to take the time and put a stand here. Times have changed. I get more serious about my hunting every year and strive to shoot only mature bucks. I carry an extra bottle of cover scent with me at all times. Even though I took my time and tried not to work up to much of a sweat walking in, I pretty much was dripping with sweat by the time I got to my stand. Once I arrived at my stand I sprayed down very liberally again to try and cover the stench of my sweat. I then climbed into my stand, attached the rope and then hoisted up my bow. I then sprayed down a third time. Now, it was 4:30pm and finally time to start hunting.\n\nI was quite surprised by the number of squirrels I saw. They appeared to be out in record numbers. I sat in the stand watching and listening to the squirrels until about 6:00 pm. Out of the corner of my right eye, I caught movement that was not a squirrel. It was a nice big doe. I talked to my son Mitchell (Deer Slayer on BGH) and told him I will not be shooting a doe tonight unless it was an albino or a piebald. We have seen an albino doe on the property in years past so we know the genes exist here to see another albino sometime. This doe and her 2 fawns were coming from a pond that is down over a hill. They must have got up from their beds, got a drink then proceeded to come up past my stand which is in a corner of a large oak grove. There are multiple trails coming and going in every direction in the corner where my stand is and there is water down over the hill and acorn and hickory nut trees that litter the hillside where my stand is. The doe and her fawns walked past my stand on the right. I had an easy 25 yard shot on her but chose not to take it. They then walked on and came up the trail 15 yards right in front of my stand. As the big doe was walking up the trail it looked as if her eyes caught mine and I thought I was busted. She only looked at me for about 5 seconds then continued on without any signs of worry. The doe turned broadside again and I chose not to take her again. This second opportunity was very tempting but I was able to hold off. I was there to see what would come out of the bedding area just as the light was fading, if anything at all. She walked down the trail a little way and she gave me a perfect quartering away shot. Again, I chose not to take the shot. By this time 15 minutes had passed and it was now 6:15. The next 45 minutes except for more squirrels was uneventful.\n\nIt was now 7:00 pm. The canopy of leaves in this area is still pretty heavy. Light was fading and I was going to give it about 15 more minutes. At 7:02 I heard a loud snap of a branch straight out in front of me. It sounded to be about 50 yards or so away. I intently was looking for what made the sound of that branch snapping. I was hoping it would be one of the big bucks that I know lives in this area. I saw a glimpse of brown passing through the trees. I now knew it was at the least a deer. I kept an intense stare on the area I knew the deer was at. It moved again and this time I saw antlers. At this point in time though I was still unsure if it was a shooter or not. The buck was continuing towards and about 30 yards away I finally had a full view of his rack. I knew at this point he was definitely a shooter. Right now he was walking straight at me and was about to walk up the same path the doe and her fawns took earlier. When he came up the embankment he stopped short of the top and looked in both directions. He decided to turn left and walk around to my right side. There was a number of trees lining the embankment so I could cautiously turn and hope he would not catch my movement. There is a large double tree off to my right and I would position myself for when he stepped out from behind this tree I would let him have it.\n\nHe kept slowly walking and stopped right when he was behind that tree. I was thinking to myself I need you to take two more steps and stop. The buck must have read my mind because that is exactly what he did. I didn't have to stop him or anything. I couldn't have asked for a better scenario. I had my crossbow up and pointed already and now it was just a matter of making a small adjustment until I had the crosshairs of my scope on the kill zone. The buck gave me a 15 yard, slight quartering to shot. I pulled the trigger on my Horton Legend crossbow and let the Easton XX75 arrow tipped with the Rage 2 blade broadhead fly. I watched as it hit it's mark. I thought ahh yes!!! It was a perfect shot. I watched the buck take off like a freight train. He ran down the embankment across a flat little area back up another hill then out of sight.\n\nOnce he was out of sight I began counting until I heard him crash. One thousand one, one thousand two, one thousand three. Crash, crash, thrash, thrash, I heard the buck now rolling around on the ground and then I heard this deep aaaarrrrrgggghhhh. I call that the death growl. I knew he was dead. I shot him at 7:05 pm. I texted my son Mitchell at 7:06pm and wrote BBD BABY BBD JUST NAILED HIM!!!!!. My son immediately called and asked me the details. I told him at the time I think he was a big 10 pointer but I didn't look at the rack too much and I wasn't sure but I definitely knew he was a shooter and I heard him crash and he was down. I told him I would find the arrow and then call him back. I then called my friend Dave and told him and he asked me if I was sure I wanted to pursue him or wait until morning. I said I heard him crash and I heard the death growl and I knew he was down. I got down and went to the point of impact and could not find my arrow or see any blood. I walked the way the buck ran and looked for blood and any part of the arrow but I did not see any at all.\n\nMy son called me back and was wondering why I didn't call him back. I said I couldn't find the arrow or any blood and I was starting to second guess myself on pursuing the buck any farther. He asked me again what happened and I told him the details. I was positive the buck was down but just in case I was wrong I did not want to push him. My son said wait and he would be out to help me find him.\n\nBy the time  my son and I got back to the stand site 45 minutes had passed and it was now completely dark. But, with the help of the flashlight I won in a BGH grand slam contest I knew we could find the buck. This flashlight is awesome. It lights up everything. We walked the way the buck ran. Scanning back and forth looking for blood. Finally about 60 yards from the point of impact I spotted a drop of blood about the size of an apple seed. The blood was bubbly. The further we walked the drops were getting closer together and bigger. We reached the top of the hill where I last seen and scanned the area. We walked about another 10 yards on the blood trail and I scanned the area again. I said I see brown. My son said be careful but I knew he was dead.","May 11, 2014","true","2.9"," 16 of 28 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","16","28","0","4"

I bought it on sale and i think its worth about 5 bucks, i would not pay more than that for this game though.","February 10, 2015","true","21.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The game goes like this:\n\n1) Select your target animal(s), location and equipment.\n\n2) Track your target animal(s). You can use an RV or a horse to get around the big maps, and binoculars/calls to figure out where your target is. You can also use decoy animals and scents to bring your prey to you. Most animals will smell/see/hear you from a long way off so you have to hide yourself well. You can bring a tree seat and hide up in the branches, set up a camoflagued tent or just lie down in some nearby bushes.\n\n3) Wait. This can take ages so it's a good game for audiobooks/podcasts. Occasionally make a call (not too often or you'll scare it off). When your target gets close enough, bring out your weapon (there's a variety of rifles, shotguns and a few bows/crossbows) and shoot the bugger.\n\n4) If you hit it in the right spot it'll die instantly, sometimes it'll run off and die of blood loss so you'll have to track it down. Tag your animal and it goes off to the trophy room.\n\nThere are also a lot of missions if you want something more structured, but there's a good variety of environments and animals to keep you occupied. You can also go to Africa and hunt elephants/lions for some reason. There's a modpack that adds new equipment, skins and weapons: go get that too.

Okay, but I want to say, I've loved these games. But as you get around 2008-2010, the games begin to be basically the same thing. They added maybe a few minor things, whether missions to adding one new animal. But other than that, it was basically the same game. It had the same missions as in the previous games. That's the only thing I find wrong about it, since they are pretty much just having you buy the same game, Lol. But other than that, I love this game. And also, the original. If they add the first one, I will jump on that too.
