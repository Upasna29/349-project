The only "feature" they promised and delivered was the intuitive control. The navigation is pretty much the default for 3d software.\n\nIncomplete. Not a work in progress. Not an early access. It's simply a pre-alpha quality release being sold as a final product. Typos, bugs, endless crashes. Not Steam quality standard.\n\nYou can hire extra engineers, but can't get them to do anything. The development was aborted before that. You have a tooltip they call a tutorial on description. But it explains what they planned to develop, not what they actually did. You can sell your skyscraper. And sometimes you'll be able to buy it back for the original land value... and sell again for the skyscraper value... and repeat... If for some reason the game sells you two vehicles with the same name, your save file is wasted. the game will crash when you try to sell or move the vehicle or when the building process is over.\n\nFor ages 6 and below. Not challenging. One of the only simulator games where anyone that can read will probably get everything right since the first attempt. If you sell your buildings, you'll get rich. If you rent them out, you'll get rich. You can just set the price to maximum and ensure maximum profits. Nothing to calculate, no need for operations research. Any building will sell for maximum price within one year. And you can't build a new one faster than that anyway... no need to hurry then. If you set the rent out price to the maximum, you'll get the maximum sale value every 4 years. You'll start slower, but will build up steady income faster (exponential income growth). You can use your steady income to ensure you won't run out of money when investing more than you have.\n\nAs a matter of fact, your only job is to allocate workforce and machinery. Too bad that's about half a thousandth of the skyscraper building costs. In other words, you can fail pathetically and will still look successful.\n\nFor some reason, you can rent out your skyscraper as soon as it's about 20% done constructing (60% total building time). That means you only need money enough for 60% of the building process. From that point on, the rent will give you more than you can possibly spend on its construction.\n\nNo maps or modding. No scripting to fix their bugs. Simulators really need modding capabilities. Especially if the developers decide not to finish the game before (or after) selling.\n\nOnly worth buying if it has a 98% off discount. The only two challenges in the game are:\n1 - Play for one hour without quitting out of boredom or having the game crash.\n2 - Try to have fun playing this. Your role is irrelevant. There is no real challenge.\n3 - Go bankrupt without intentionally cutting all your revenue streams.\n\nTL;DR: the official game screenshots will bring you more challenge and fun than the actual game. They've worked harder on them than the development.","October 23, 2013","false","14.4"," 163 of 172 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","163","172","2","3"

I am not sure it is worth 3.33p even. Wow. This is made by the same people that made the narcolepsy inducing Airport Simulator 2014, a game where you drive vehicles around an airport. So what do you think Skyscraper Simulator is all about? Driving vehicles around a construction site. Except you can automate the driving this time around, wonders will never cease. You start off with $40m Euro and buy a plot of land in New York. You'd think they'd be after dollars, but who am I to query the knowledge of these master game developers. Then you buy a couple of vehicles, so far so good. The vehicles have super weird randomly generated names like "Doleful Elizabeth" or "Freaky Dylan". Bewildering. Then you hire some employees. Some of them might take weeks to turn up, whilst your digger is sitting there doing nothing. Great. Eventually they turn up. Now you can dig a hole. You can let the game do this, I advise that you do exactly that. Wait, I advise that you do not even try and get this far. Anyway, I watched a digger dig a hole and trucks cart off mud for fully 10 minutes. I had completed 20% of the excavation. So I went back to the main map of NY as I was bit bored and wondered what else I could do. "EXCAVATION FINISHED!" flashed up the message 1 second later. Then I quit the game, although I saved first.

STAY THE F*_*CK AWAY FROM IT!!!\n\nThis was one of the first games I bought on Steam and, boy, what a way to start.\n\nThe first thing that struck me was the bland and undetailed graphics that just made my eyes share some tears for how bad they looked. I'm not the kind of guy that judges a game by it's graphics. But, damn! The graphics of this game sucks right across the board! The world overview is just a Google Maps image used as a texture and slapt over a overly simplified 3D "model" of a "city". Do I need to go further on how the graphics on this game sucks? In case I do, lemme tell you that you have only TWO models of skyscrapers to choose from and, as you might expect, they look like HORRIBLE. And when I say HORRIBLE, I REALLY mean it.\n\nThe gameplay is so bland, so poor, so repetitive and counfusing that I actually felt sad experiencing it. You will spend maybe five to ten minutes micromanaging stuff to get your skyscraper done and that's it. Your skyscraper will be finished and you'll not feel a single dent of accomplishment for it. You will, in fact, feel sad for having wasted your life with such a poor and boring excuse of a game. Wasn't it enough, there is a bug in the game that will start playing thousands of samples at the same time making a hell of a noise, just like a freaking stun grenade, and, if this bug don't blow your eardrums instantly, will definitelly leave your ears ringing for a while. Sound fun, eh?!\n\nThis game is an offence to anyone who bought it. And the best part is that the developers just don't give a flying f:3ck about it being bad; they just don't bother paying attention to the feedback given by the costumers to improve it. Well, if the developers made this "tvrd" (that's latin for sh*t) of a game only to make some quick buck and not improve it any further, I say ♥♥♥♥ the developers and ♥♥♥♥ this game.\n\nHave my 0, ZERO, ZED, NONE, NULL out of 10.","December 23, 2013","false","2.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

You control how many people, dozers, cranes, etc are working on your tower. Gameplay is oddly linear: you can't do anything until you've finished "excavating", then you have to build a foundation, which is the most boring part, and then construction starts. That last phase is the most exciting -- you get to play duelling cranes by allocating your cranes between the concrete team and the steel team.\n\nNot much to it. The beginning is frustrating (not enough money), the middle 5 minutes are okay, the rest is boring (you have too much money).

There are some major flaws with the game though that prevent it from being enjoyable beyond the first attempt.\n\nThere's no skill required\n\nThe process of hiring and firing people, buying equipment, and scheduling tasks is practically automatic.  It requires very little of the player and the game even tells you when it's time to do something.\n\nEconomy Simulation lacks info\n\nYou don't know if you rent out on a monthly. quarterly, or yearly basis.  I couldn't find any sort spreadsheet of my assets or anything like that.  You have to wait forever before you can make your second skyscraper and then... ugh. More waiting.\n\nbad graphics, lack of interactivity\n\nokay so google maps do a better job than this game does, and frankly it looks like they stole images from google maps anyway. Furthermore, you can actually go back to your skyscraper and enjoy the look of it, get close, see inside etc. A real shame considering that it's a simulator about skyscrapers.\n\nNot worth full asking price, I got it as part of a humble bundle package, it's worth about 99 cents.\n\n","February 4, 2014","false","0.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Unfortunately, it didn't even match my lowered expectations.\n\nInitially, I thought I could have input into the skyscraper's design; fiddle with floorplans and construction methods and so forth. What I got was 3 arbitrary choices for sky scraper design and 4 slider bars to tweak quality/quantity/type of rooms in the building, and the number of floors. That's it.\n\nAt this point I thought 'oh well, maybe they make up for this with complex and engaging mechanics in management of the actual construction. I could dig that.' What I expected now was a game with plenty of 'make sure this resource is managed well' and 'hire/fire staff as needed', but also a game with slightly complex decisions like choosing companies to contract with, or buying resource sources. Also random events, and a solid progression as described of 'start with multistory houses, and work up to mega skyscrapers'. What I got was a game of 'hire/fire people as needed. that's it.'\n\nBy the time I finished the tutorial/learning process (completed one skyscraper), I decided I'd build another. I maxed the speed the whole time, and found myself entirely and utterly bored. This isn't really a game so much as an add-on for some other, non-existant game with the other 90% of the process. I am generally not critical of games, but this game is only worth a dollar or two as it stands. These simulator games seem to be turning out to be a money grab, rather than a genuine simulator. Much less a fun game.","January 5, 2014","false","2.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The initial instructions you receive tell you EXACTLY what to do, how to do it and when to do it, but will only do so in a manner where you will succeed "averagely".\nIt is then up to the player to optimise their workforce to increase production speed, reduce costs and maximise profits when renting and choosing the opportune time to sell the building.\n\nIt has a similar play style to KSP in that, its all about your prep work. If you don't prepare well, you will fail.\n\nThe complaints about bugs are again, undeserved. The only major one I had was that I had to change my system audio quality from 24bit 48khz to 16bit (this is common for older simulator games), and even this is stated in a pinned topic on discussion, yet there are still regular complaint threads cropping up because the pinned material is not read.\n\nUnfortunately, the "casual" core of gamers have managed to perpetuate the myth that all these simulator games are ALWAYS buggy and ALWAYS boring and the staple of germans everywhere, but then the kind of people who say that generally aren't the audience for these simulators and probably picked them up cheap or because their "favorite youtuber" did an episode on Farming Simulator 2013 and think Lolcats are still funny.\n\nThe game is NOT recommended if you are expecting a simulator where you can constantly tweak stuff, it is NOT recommended if you think this is anything like those simulators which are not simulators *Cough* Goat Sim*Cough* and it is NOT recommended if you have the patience of a 6 year old.\n\nIf you want something to play while you stick on some tunes or chat to some mates in TS/Voip this is for you, if you want something where you can spend time minmaxing staff and finding an "optimal" method, this is for you.","April 20","true","1.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

When I saw this game, thought it could be a good micromanagement simulator, but it started to drive me crazy even before the gameplay because I couldn't launch it (actually I spent more time trying to make it work than playing the game). There's no strategy in it, it's a one way road where there's a right path, and everything different will result in game over.

Honestly, I'm not sure why it was rated so horribly by so many.  There are fairly clear directions that pop on the screen (are easily removable/recallable) telling you what to do.  [The biggest complaint I've read was that equipment was purchased in perfect condition, but then was rated horribly.  You have to fill the equipment with people by going to the lower selections and highering people.]  I built 8 skyscrappers in probably 7 hours of real playing time (at my computer).  The only thing I didn't read, but easily figured out was when you reach a maximium of 6 properties, you have to stop 'renting' one out and sell it.\n\nAs you successfully build them, more properities around the city and more varied designs become available to build with.\n\nThe game does not come without flaws though.  There are bugs, but none that crashed my computer or prevented me from playing at all.  One was a display of my money in the upper right where it'd keep jittering every once in a while.  Another was where I built a skyscrapper on Battery Park and when it completed it (though still listing it as the Battery Park location), placed it in the middle of central NYC.  It also enlarged it by a factor of 3.  (There are screen caps in my profile on the game).  (Note: after building the next skyscrapper, it did reset the size of the one to a normal level.)\n\nAll in all, it's not horrible.  I got it as part of a bundle and took a chance, despite the reviews.  I played on a lower end laptop and though lowering the video graphics on it to it's lowest setting, it all ran smooth.  The biggest complaint of mine was the factor of time.  You often would basically set everything up to build and then just fast forward.  Which when doing so, still took a long while even at a factor of x10.  Again, it's not the world's worst game as the ratings indicate.  It's playable and kinda fun.  It's not intricate or mindblowing on dynamics.  But it's alright to pickup and play for a dozen or so hours.","June 10, 2015","true","16.0"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","1"

I got it in a gift trade, had  a quick look for what it promised in its store page and accepted it go go along the other things in the trade. Total mistake, u get here thinking it is a simulator? That you are going to have some control over what you do right? NO, NO, NO.\nListen to this: All you do in this game is watch. That is right.\nYou can assign workers by clicking on arrows.....thats it, u click on arrows....and u watch as they build default buildings....u cant choose what the building can be, u cant do anything but watch. just watch numbers and images changing. i give this game 0/10. I think thats the only game that holds such grade in my book. Not only because it is trash but because it misleads the buyer.

This is a blatant lie; in reality it is an "not responding" window simulator.\nWhen you first load up the game, you are greated by a series of company logos; Developer, Publisher, etc. Then as the last logo fades to black, with much fanfair absolutly nothing happens. The screen remains blank. The Steam overlay freezes in place, and the game stops responding.\n\nThe issue lies not in my hardware. My i7-4790k, gt740, and 16GB of ram well exceed the minimum specifications. The issue lies purely in this peice of software(search online, many people suffer the same affliction).\n\nAs far as I can find, there is no fix. The game is broken and in an unplayable state. I would strongly recommend not purchasing "Skyscraper Simulator", save your $10USD for something else.\n\nTL;DR\nPros: -A dang fine black screen before it crashes.\n\nCons: -Lacks any kind of depth/gameplay in its current state, because it does not work.\n\nOther Thoughts: I am used to Early Access games being flawed, however this is beyond that. This is by-far the most broken Early Access games in my library of 400 games.","January 15, 2015","false","0.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","2","4","2","0"

This game has the most amazing soundtrack I have ever heard. The game itself is quite silly, and there's not a lot of fun to be had in it, but honestly, if it's on a sale or something, buy it for dirt cheap, download it, and just listen to the soundtrack.

Plus it's impressive that they managed to fit all that black screen in just a 260MB download!\n\nEdit: Right, I'm going to add my review of Airport Simulator here because it's made by the same people. Unbelievably, there's even less substance to that game than there was to SS. It crashes within the first 2 seconds, which means that it would take a lot more time and effort than I'm prepared to spend to get to the required 5 minutes of playtime before leaving a review.
