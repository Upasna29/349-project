Free.\n\nHere's a Quick Look video I did of the game after “winning” it. Have a look if you want to see the game in action, or just read the in-depth review below for something more concise. (Please note I did this video before it was released on Steam, which simply means it only shows the original game and not the much-harder, remixed version you can select at the beginning)\n\nhttp://youtu.be/LIjulBMI85U\n\nTo begin, I'll say this game is a classic platformer in every sense. You jump from platform to platform all the while dodging spikes, energy balls, angry crabs, and anything else the game throws at you. Yet while you may not be able to kill anything, you are able to acquire power-ups like activating ghost blocks, double jumping, and jumping off walls to navigate the map easier. There are even checkpoints littered everywhere so when you do die, you can instantly respawn and try again as many times as you wish.\n\nBut don't be fooled. Although you may not have any lives (except if you're doing YOLO or the cat, you crazy person), the game is challenging, especially when you're gunning for optional moneybags to collect. You'll probably die multiple times before nailing the pattern down to pass to the next screen. But thankfully it never feels frustrating due to the instant respawn that's always nearby. It's the game's forgiving nature that allows you to constantly want to beat what's stopping you. And I can safely say that every time I did fail, I just dismissed it as my own fault and kept at it until I beat the obstacle. Which is truly the mark of a good platformer.\n\nThe game also has a nice, retro visual style. I enjoy how the game acts as if you're playing a classic game on an old TV. It really put me back in the mood when I was just a kid playing my NES. Now while I realize that some people may not have experienced or liked something like this, I really do think it adds to the game because it successfully mimics the era where games used to be like this. It simply gave me nostalgia all over. But hey, for those that don't want it, you can easily turn it off in the options menu.\n\nNow let's talk about a few of the game's flaws:\n*There's no music. Some awesome chiptunes really would've made this game shine. Instead all you get is silence\n*It's really short. It'll only take about an hour to “beat,” more if you collect everything and explore\n*No story. You just thrown into it not knowing what the heck you are or what you're doing. Personally, I don't really mind it not having one since games like Mario never really had much of story either, but some people like to have some purpose other than beating the game. And no, the clever title doesn't count as a reason =p\n\nThat's really all of the negatives I could think of. The game simply does its job well, especially so because of how it leads you where you need to be without holding your hand. There's no maps, quest markers, or waypoints telling you where to go, just like most classic games. But somehow I always wound up where I needed to be even when exploring just for the fun of it. Sure, the game liked leading you to places you couldn't do anything in until you got a power-up, or even trolling you by making you do platforming again for trying to take an easy route, but I always regarded it as a discovery that brought me one step closer to the end.\n\nSo to sum this game up, it's simply a joy to play. You don't get many free games as good as this one. So if you have some time to burn or are bored, pick this up and have a blast. There's even a NG+ for those like me who missed stuff on their first playthrough.","May 6, 2014","true","1.4"," 200 of 238 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","200","238","0","0"

The game has the look of the early PC games I grew up on, complete with CGA graphics (you play it through an in-game CRT monitor emulated on the screen), but designed with the modern pixel-perfect platforming sensibilities of games like VVVVVV and Super Meat Boy. Thankfully, it's not nearly as hard as those games, and can be easily completed in around an hour or so with a little bit of determination. Checkpoints are liberal, and there is no penalty for dying. And for those who enjoy a tougher challenge, there are harder modes available, along with a collection sidequest for 100% completion.\n\nAnd the best part? It's absolutely free. Seriously, as in no-strings attached, no microtransaction bull$h%t, 100% free. One might think that may mean the quality probably isn't that great, but I assure you it's rock-solid, and clearly made with love and care by someone who was inspired by those early days of PC gaming as much as I was.

I've gotten about 8+ hours of enjoyment out of this game so far, so it's emphatically been an incredible value. If you like games like Super Meat Boy, hell even if you don't, download this game. It's free, so what have you got to lose?!\n\n[GOOD]\n+ Plenty of presentation options. Play in the old school looking default settings, or if that doesn't tickle your fancy, set it up the way you want with the multitude of display options available. 8-bit color, 16-bit color, fullscreen, monitor border, there's a lot there.\n+ Tight controls. A game like this NEEDS spot on controls, and "You Have to Win the Game" delivers. I was able to comfortably play only using the keyboard, something that's very difficult to do with other hardcore platformers.\n+ Simplistic gameplay. No health bars, attacks, scores, timers, lives, map screens, inventories, etc. It's just jump past obstacles and collect the 4 powerups you need to advance in the game. Very simple, very clean.\n+ Challenging. FACT: You will die a lot in this game. But if you keep at it you'll eventually move past difficult obstacles and subsequent run throughs will become easier and easier.\n+ Incredible replay value. "Won" the game? Great, now try the extra spicy mode. Then try and go for 100% completion on both maps. Or beat it as a cat. Or try and beat it in under 10 minutes. Or without dying. Two maps (the original and then the remixed and more difficult 'extra spicy'), a cat mode, and YOLO mode, plus going for 100% completion, gives you a lot to do after your first go round.\n+ Style is well done. YHTWTG looks and plays like it came straight out of an 80s arcade machine.\n+ Good time waster. Play for 5 minutes or 50, either way you'll feel like you're advancing well enough. Can play in chunks or long sessions.\n+ FREE!!!\n+ Exploration. The game plays kind of like a metroidvania where there are certain places you can't get to until you get the powerup that will allow you to access it. This leads to a lot of exploring and backtracking as you collect powerups.\n\n[NEUTRAL]\n= No music. Didn't bother me at all.\n= Sound effects consist of blips and bloops. True to it's nostalgic roots.\n\n[BAD]\n- Backtracking through areas can get tiresome.\n- Confusing to know where you're at at times. A map feature would have been great.\n- Some screens require pixel perfect placement to beat.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kenofthedead/recommended/286100/","kenofthedead","KenOD","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kenofthedead/","1076 products in account","A free game that is a loving tribute to the platformers and "open world" of the ZX Spectrum/Commodore 64/NEC computer days, where the world was divided between different screens that formed the whole of a world much like VVVVVV was, rather than the scrolling with the character that came with Pitfall and Super Mario Bros. Make no mistake while this is a tribute and love letter to many a classic game in level lay out, early 80s tube computer box outline, and art style for it's game world, it is very much a game for modern design and ease of getting into.\n\nA game where you have plenty of opportunities to learn exactly what to do due to natural and clear explanation of what to do in what is shown and required (touch an enemy and die, longer pit requires to hold the jump longer, etc), and true to it's roots it never gets too confusing in what to do or where to go unless you yourself have lost your way. It rewards mastering the jumps and wall jumps (a power up), it gives the chance for pixel perfect jumping when desired in it's normal mode, nothing is impossible to reach once you know how and can (power ups, 2 of them), and there is never a situation where one can get stuck.\nAs it is old school it can prove challenging to those who require a clear cut map, as none is provided and instead has one memorising the world and it's lay out until you have a good idea where to go next. As death is never a issue in it's normal mode, with Super Meat Boy like instant-respawn and an infinite number, however one is never punished for exploring and through time you learn the routes to take until they become second nature. Take as many tries as needed, never respawn too far from doing it again or leaving to try something else, it's open to you with the normal mode. As it is screen to screen, a static image as only you and enemies and some objects move in it, you learn what each one looks like with a way to remember them by a quote at the bottom to make each one stand out beyond just it's unique lay out.\n\nNever more than a game about collecting all the money bags in the world and platforming save for one end game puzzle, which you are told how to solve by clues written on the wall, your only worry is your own skill at platforming. You jump, you wall jump eventually, you slide down, you move. The enemies are things that move from left to right or shoot small bullets in a set pattern, nothing to worry about because they never do anything different and thus you can take your time until you master them. Then, quickly speed past them and that may just be the best tactic to get through a specific screen.\n\nAs a platformer fan, as someone who loves to explore a game world, and one who enjoys creative designs with limitations on what is actually shown at any given time, I find this to just to be a spectacular and amazing game that does so many things right and is a pure example of a platformer. A game where my first play through was filled with numerous deaths, gave me the greatest sense of satisfaction in earning an achievement (Steam) when I beat the game by never dying, proving that I had mastered the game and knew exactly what to do.\n\nYet it doesn't even end there. For it offers a Master Quest style challenge, named Extra Spicy Mode, which completely changes up the lay out of every screen, the order in which you travel the world, the challenge offered, and you collect power ups in reverse making it that much more of a different experience. A wonderful thing to go through after I had just "mastered the game and knew exactly what to do". One section required me to do a pixel perfect landing on what normally is death for example, another learning not to jump to keep yourself alive as normal on a vertical positioned platform, and it made me work through it and improve my skill that much more without ever being unfair.\n\nThere are issues that can prevent many people from finishing it because it is challenging, those who quit games easily/rage quit may find little to love here as it's all on the player, at times easy for some to lose track of where they are or going due to no map, it won't be for all fans of platformers who want the Super Mario Bros influenced style of always moving right and holding down speed and jumping only, and there is no action/attacking some crave. Yet it is still one of the best examples of this type of platforming, a loving homage to a style very rarely seen today, and of course it's free so there is no loss in trying.\n\nAlso you can play as a cat.","January 23, 2015","true","6.4"," 51 of 57 people (89%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","89","51","57","7","1"

One might call it MetroidVania style since its a big open world that has you moving from screen to screen. Each 'room' is only a screen like the original Zelda. Since you are exploring, there is no map. The controls are simple, left and right to move and a jump button. On certain platforms you can hit down on them to fall through the platform like many old school 2D platformers.\n\nWhere's the challenge? When you get hit by an enemy or spike you die instantly. Luckily there are checkpoint bells everywhere on almost every screen. When you die, you instantly respawn with no load times. It really keeps you in the action. It is very similar to VVVVVV but much easier and relaxing. If you get frustrated easily, this might not be the game for you, but since you respawn, there's no real punishment for failing.\n\nThe game takes an hour or so to complete. For the most part the game is easy fun. It starts out calming and relaxing as you explore, but eventually has tricky platforming areas and intense bullet dodging boss battles. Along the way you'll find loot bags. What do they do? Nothing but an achievement at the end if you collect 100% of them.\n\nProgressing through the game, you will enable different things such as solid blue blocks, solid purple blocks, double jump and so on. To enable each thing, you must get past the boss. I say get past, because you are just a boy in this game with no combat. You will dodge enemies and in the case of a boss, dodge dozens of bullets on screen at once. The bosses fire in patterns, so you will get the hang of it. There is not that much enemy variety, bats, snakes and crabs move left and right, spiders move up and down. The game's main enemy is spikes.\n\nSince this is a retro style game, by default the game has a 1980s monitor feel. Thankfully you can turn off the 1980s monitor and see everything full screen with no added glare. For anyone that finds the game too easy, there is a remixed level design which is much more difficult yet still forgiving with checkpoints everywhere. If you are brave enough there is cat mode that features 9 lives and YOLO that has one life and then its game over.\n\nThis is an easy recommendation, but if it was $1 or more challenging I'd be hesitant to recommend, but this feels like a good game for the developer to make a better game with. Solid controls, the understanding of an easy beginning headed toward difficult end.","September 3, 2014","true","3.8"," 32 of 36 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","32","36","0","0"

I think not, lol.\n\nSeriously, it is actually a well crafted game, and for people who are good at games like Electronic Super Joy, Love, and so on, this game will provide a fun challenge. If you are like me though, the 100th death or so is the point where I had to decide just how much I valued my gamepad. Turns out, I value my gamepad a whole lot more than I value this game, so rather than smash the controller, I deleted this game.\n\nThat said, the quality of this game cant be denied, and it happens to be free as well, so there is no reason not to play it and decide for yourself. It is designed to make you angry but also get a sense of achievement when you finally do get your timing down and do something. you also get a very real sense of frustration when you fail to do so and end up having to try the same thing over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................♥♥♥♥!","January 10, 2015","true","0.3"," 23 of 30 people (77%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","77","23","30","12","0"

And after completing this game, i can say that this game being free is a steal. This is an awesome game with a great gameplay. It's not too hard to make you quit the game (speaking for myself) and not too easy, just perfect. It does have some tricky places to go through which makes it all the more fun. And there's no map in this game so you pretty much have to rely on your memory. Every room has it's own name which is many a time pretty funny.\n\nI really loved this game. But then again, I'm a sucker for puzzle/hardcore masochistic platformers. But as it is free, i would recommend everyone to atleast give it a try.

The aesthethic is very simple as you can see from the screenshots; and it emulates being played on an old monitor. Even then, you can disable that effect, and add colour if you like.\n\nSo, let's go to gameplay. It's a pretty simple platformer, but, like I mentioned above, it's challenging. It also has a metroidvania style, meaning that there's no clear path when you start, but you still need to unlock certain abilities in order to progress. Most of the levels offer a different puzzle, and while some might seem hard at first, once you figure out how to solve them, they can be quite easy. Even then, there's a few that relay on fast reflexes, which increases the difficulty a bit, but, as I said, the game is forgiving, meaning you'll always have a checkpoint nearby whenever a tough puzzle comes up.\n\nThe game also offers three different gamemodes: normal, with unlimited lives; cat mode, with 9 lives (but keeps checkpoints); and YOLO mode, which disables checkpoints entirely, meaning that if you die, you've got to restart from the beginning. Even then, when you come to know the game, YOLO mode adds a nice challenge. Besides the different gamemodes, the game offers two campaigns, the original campaign, and the "Extra Spicy" one, which changes most of the levels, making them more difficult.\n\nI don't think I have a lot more to say about this game, other than I enjoyed it. If you like platformers like VVVVVV, or Super Meat Boy, I think you'll enjoy this game.","May 17","true","6.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Think Metroid with checkpoints and unlimited lives. Every time you get a new item, a new area becomes reachable, so you have to memorize all of the areas you can't reach to go back to them later. I also enjoyed all of the options to make the game window look even more like an old Commodore 64 computer. A true blast to the past.\n\nOverall, a great free game and worth the disk space.

Build-up of the levels is nice, unlocking of skills (4) fine and challenges are nicely ramped-up. The game has a few options to change the retro-view which is quite nice and I ended up using the old-skool monitor setup with the 2 color setup as it really fitted the game best.\n\nGame can be completed by the average player in 2-3 hours in the first run, if you can decipher the winning word. Losing is also an option to end the game (and achievement) so in the end you play it twice, which is fun as you speedrun the game the second time.\n\nIn the end I had a lot of fun playing the game and wanting to finish it.

You have to win the game!\n\nThe game starts of in a room where the player are given chances to learn the simple controls, walk and jump. From there on, as you collects more equipment, your walk and jump won't be the same as before. The game will challenge your platforming skill and your patience as you explore numerous rooms each with a different obstacles to overcome. As some room features a nerve-wracking obstacles, players get to hone their platforming skills as they jump over spikes and enemies. Unlike some of your usual platforming, you can't kill the enemies. This contributes the game to only make it more challenging.\n\nI find it quite disappointing somehow that the game doesn't contain any background music during my gameplay. The music in the trailer sounded really good. Chiptunes aside, the graphics are just beautiful. When was the last time you played a game that has a calming graphics where it doesn't burn your eyes to look at? The simple colors used in this game really pleases me, and especially that hard mode. The first normal play you're underground of some sort, managed to complete it, challenge yourself for a harder run as you witness an outstanding retro forest.\n\nI'm not going to talk more about it since the game itself is free.

For me, this is best shown in You Have to Win the Game.\n\nCons:\n-No music whatsoever. I understand that it's going for the style of a Commodore game, but many games for that computer had good music. This is my biggest problem with the game.\n-It seems to me as though the developer (who refers to himself as Kyle in the "support the developer" section) tried too hard to exactly mimic the C64. I would love to see this game made more expansive.\nPros\n-Metroid-style gameplay. Of course, there are fewer items, you're not a badass Power Suit-wearing bounty hunter like Samus (in fact, as far as I know, there is no weapon) but the combination of player-driven exploration and strong platforming bears a resemblance to Super Metroid or Metroid II.\n-Amazing conveyance. Here is how the developer designed the game: You start the game and immediately encounter branching paths. Since the player just started, they want to keep going. They choose a direction and go. As they go along, they find outlines of platforms. They realize that there must be something to create platforms. This gives them the patience to keep going. They eventually find a boss. Having no weapon, they instead figure out the most effective way to dodge the barrage of projectiles. They then will find either the Crimson or Cerulean Aura. Et cetera, et cetera. Short version: the game is good at keeping the player going and teaching them.\n-The player is always, always in control.","April 25","true","0.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rancourt/recommended/286100/","rancourt","Dusty Rancourt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rancourt/","2088 products in account","What really defines a "retro game?"\n\nSure, there are quite a few two-dimensional one-afternoon's-scope games out there with chunky, obvious pixels and "chiptune" soundtracks -- how I hate that appellation, much as I dig the genre itself -- and surely you've encountered buckets of 'em in your travels. They're clearly trying to appeal to a certain nostalgic market, but I find that many of these so-called "retro" games don't really understand what it is to which they're alleging to pay homage.\n\nYou Have To Win The Game has no such difficulty. It understands its audience quite intimately.\n\nIf you've ever played an early home computer platformer, with brittle, stylized art tiles on a sea of black background, stages rather than a scrolling continuous playfield, and that curiously fast twitch-timing that makes "simple" tricks hard to duplicate without a dead-steady hand, you'll recognize this one immediately. Fans of the Monty Mole games, Jet Set Willy, Montezuma's Revenge, Dark Castle, and other multiscreen platformers will be right at home. The CGA-style 'magenta and cyan' default graphics cement this port clearly as a PC game, though there's an option to step up to 16-color EGA graphics if you prefer. The PC speaker style sound effects, staggered hex-aligned pixels with faint scanlines, and bowing of the screen to a curved glass surface really drive home that this game is an artifact from a cultural time capsule, and the simulated monitor bezel around it completes the effect nicely.\n\nBe sure to return the disk to its protective sleeve and file it away in its sunshielded flipcases when you're done with it.\n\nThe game itself is delightfully frustrating, prone to tease the player with glimpses of as-yet-inaccessible areas, to inspire mad curiosity about the only occasionally map-friendly physics. Many rooms map easily, yes, but some loop back on themselves, or take you to places from which you can't easily return by stepping back through the passage behind you. Some rooms are clearly designed to make you sweat and suffer, and suffer you shall if you want to earn that coveted 100% at the end. Be glad for the unlimited lives in the standard game mode -- you'll need 'em. (If you're truly crazy, try the Playable Cat mode for nine lives, or the YOLO mode for a single life.)\n\nThe game is an exploration platformer and a puzzle game. Without ruining its secrets, let it suffice to say that careful note-taking, mapping, and that sort of curious and self-reliant Eighties gamer mindset will serve you well. The sort of person who would prefer platformers to be purely feats of dexterity may be frustrated by this game's unavoidable puzzle elements, but I suspect anyone who remembers the games that inspired You Have To Win The Game will recognize that this was de riguer back then. There are certainly some moments of frustration to be had playing this game, some vexingly tricky rooms to navigate, but that's part of the fun of it, really. Anyone who's put together Monty Mole's Freedom Kit or played a Sierra game in which it was all too possible to end up in an unwinnable game for lack of an item acquired earlier is surely used to these frustrations, and the "sunrise moment" of finally getting past a tough room to see what lies beyond it is ample reward.\n\nCurious minds will be left with many questions about the game world visited. The minimal, simple graphics and room names offer clues, but few answers, as to who you are, where you are, how you ended up here, why you're here, and what you're after. This too was part of the charm of these games, but I find myself intrigued by the landscape the game so simply depicts, and given such a large blank space where narrative and purpose would sit in a story, I find myself trying to imagine how this unnamed protagonist got here, to this dangerous world with its varied alien and Gothic imagery, and who the few named figures in the game are, or were.\n\nAs a platformer, it's delightfully tricky but not impossible. This aging gamer managed to achieve 100% after six hours of play, and six hours of play is quite impressive for a game of the era to which this one's paying homage. The game is well-balanced, too -- there are many optional challenges for completion that aren't strictly necessary to win. (I've seen five-minute speedruns through it.) There are some lovely challenges awaiting completionists, though, and the game does indeed reward you for your additional effort. Like every great exploration game, there are places you'll miss if you don't explore thoroughly, and seeing them all will take some real effort.\n\nThis is not a retro platformer for folks who simply like the idea of 2D games with chunky pixels. This is a love letter to the mid-Eighties home computer platformer, from the eloquent and unmistakably informed pen of J. Kyle Pittman and Pirate Hearts. This is a return to a lost era, and it is meant to bring back not only the look, not only the feel, but the entire zeitgeist of a bygone age of computer games. Tread reverently. This is a relic from an alternate universe's past, a living fossil. You can't meaningfully compare it to the games of today, at least not in capacity to rate it. Compare it to games of the increasingly distant past, and if you haven't played those games, play this one. It's a stellar specimen of the early days of home computer platformers.\n\nAuf wiedersehn?

However, if you didn't know, this is very similiar to a "rage game" as it  can definitly be frustrating and difficult to complete, hence its name. But, in my opinion, this is also a great thing as it brings a hard challenge that you wil try desperatly to overcome and achieve. The retro art style is definitly of interest and gives you a slight nostalgia. It really has no story, but then again,based on the title and its genre, you probably wern't expecting a storyline as great as Final Fantasy VII or Metal Gear Solid. Overall, this is a great game compared to most platformers and other rage-inducing games. If you like a challenge, buy this game right now, it's free. Its pretty straight forward, just beat the game.

It's insanely fun to speedrun, or if you wanna relax, it's great to just play casually as well. Extra Spicy mode is a nice challenge once you get a good feel for the game. And there's the kitty and yolo modes if you're feeling masochistic, which limit your lives to 9 and 1, respectively. Also in kitty mode (aka playable cat dlc) you play as a cat.\n\nSeriously, play it. It's ♥♥♥♥in' free, man.\n\nOh, and if someone says it's like the "I wanna be the" games, call them stupid.

However, if you didn't know, this is very similiar to a "rage game" as it  can definitly be frustrating and difficult to complete, hence its name. But, in my opinion, this is also a great thing as it brings a hard challenge that you wil try desperatly to overcome and achieve. The retro art style is definitly of interest and gives you a slight nostalgia. It really has no story, but then again,based on the title and its genre, you probably wern't expecting a storyline as great as Final Fantasy VII or Metal Gear Solid. Overall, this is a great game compared to most platformers and other rage-inducing games. If you like a challenge, buy this game right now, it's free. Its pretty straight forward, just beat the game.

Several gameplay abilities can be unlocked through the game, such as the double jump and the wall jump. Once in possession of both of them, it feels awesome.\n\nOne gripe I have with the game is  the lack of a map (although you can get one in your browser, check the steam guides).\n\nThere are different graphic styles, with more or less colors, and the borders of an old-school CRT monitor, adding to the charm.\n\nSince it's free, I recommend anyone that likes platformers to give this gem a try.","May 29, 2014","true","7.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

As someone who actually knows what a 5.25" floppy drive is, I really appreciated this. The use of the 4-color CGA palette, sprite and tile design, physics, and PC speaker beeps, and especially the level design philosophy are all spot-on. The CRT screen emulation is also genius. (Can it be open-source so we can use it for emulators?)\n\nDifficulty and play length is about the same as VVVVVV. If you found that game easy, you won't have a problem with this one either. But if you're not good at these exploration platformers, prepare to rage your way through a few rooms. But don't worry, the checkpoints are always about 2 rooms apart, so dying is no big deal.\n\nJust be warned, you can "lose" the game, too! And if you lose, you lose all your progress! There's only one way to lose, and it's clearly marked, so keep an eye out for it!\n\nThis is a very good opportunity to feel some nostalgia even older than most other throwback games offer, or if it was before your time, a chance to see how PC games looked and felt back in the 80s.

The really nasty kind, too!  We're talking hardcore prawn that will throw so many balls at your face!  You will be overwhelmed trying to avoid all the balls at the climax!\n\nHardcore prawn aside, You Have to Win the Game is one of those cool new video games all the kids are playing these days with their backwards baseball caps, CGA graphics, and CRT monitors.  What?  You haven't got a CRT monitor?  That's okay, YHTWTG is such a cool guy, he brought one along for you to play on.\n\nAlright, dialing down the flippancy for a second, this is an 8-bit nostalgia trip, but it gets some points from me for going balls to the wall (literally: see the above mention of prawn) with the style and mimicking the curve and scan lines of a CRT monitor.  The harsh magenta and cyan palette will send you screaming back to the C64/early Macintosh days and every screen has its own title invoking some games of the era like the DIzzy games and a few that escape my mind since you're asking me to remember back to a time when I thought basic multiplication was rocket science that only super old people like third graders could do.\n\nBut YHTWTG is not just some kind of Atari game that has beep booped its way into the modern age!  There are actually some pretty contemporary things going on.  Some of them are subtle, like having more frames than are carried in a man's wallet so the platforming is nice and smooth.  Others are part of the game's larger design, like including copious checkpoints and infinite lives on the default mode, so that anybody can win the game, not just masochists.  It's also quite fair, unlike its predecessors who seemed to think you loved to leap of faith into spikes and every unsignposted doom ball from off-screen was an extra quarter for them.  YHTWTG is filled with hard challenges, but all of them are right out there.  Just swinging in the breeze.  In all their naked glory.  Like the hardcore prawn.\n\nYou will die.  You will die a lot.  But it will always be your own fault for not being fast, observant, or precise.  This isn't I Wanna Be the Guy.  And that leads nicely into the gameplay: it's a pure platformer.  Your only tools are jumping and reflexes.  The game does have some Metroidy aspects, where you can roam freely between the screens and collect items to expand your ability to jump and open up new areas.  However, your only tool to deal with the obstacles in your path is, and will only ever be, slick evasion.\n\nYou'll evolve as you play YHTWTG.  You'll go from struggling to grasp the weight and precision of the platforming, to losing more bodies to flying bullets than all of World War I as you desperately push for the next checkpoint.  But slowly, inevitably, You Have to Win the Game.  And by then, you'll probably feel a little awesome.  Maybe even awesome enough to take on the big guns: cat mode (nine lives) and YOLO mode (one life).  And then you'll be some sort of Neo-esque bullet dodging demigod where you walk through a "boss" room in half a second without breaking stride as if to say, "Hollow King, you ain't nothin' but a ♥♥♥♥♥." There will be moments of utter zen as you move directly through the challenges you've completely dominated, broken by the extreme tension of those that can still wreck your ♥♥♥♥.\n\nI freely admit I have not overcome my problem with hardcore prawn (as you can no doubt tell), but man is it satisfying to say that I have even seen the hardcore prawn while YOLO!\n\nSo, You Have to Win the Game is a free, fun, full-on nostalgia trip.  There are only a couple reasons I might not recommend it to somebody.  You should probably stay away if you really can't stand the idea of even trying a hardcore platformer.  Though know that it has gone out of its way to be easy enough that you can win by sheer attrition.  It does have one possible design misstep where it confronts you with a cryptogram at the end that you have to get hints for by exploring.   If you're not into cryptograms as I am, I could see that being pretty maddening (though you could always just walkthrough that part).  And, if you're just put off by 8-bit nostalgia, this is not for you.\n\nOtherwise, definitely go and win the game!  You have to.  It said so!  And I am also telling you now!","March 2, 2015","true","7.6"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","6","10","3","2"

It's pretty entertaining too, as authentic as it is in it's retro limitations. The controls are solid, the enemies are fun to navigate through, and the end-game puzzle is a doozy. It's worth checking out if you can enjoy games like this.\n\nCONS: Turn off the special effects  in the options menu IMMEDIATELY. That dumb CRT monitor frame with the bubble effect + hideous glare is a cheap effect and detracts from the game. You'll thank yourself for turning that junk off.\n\nOVERALL: If you're looking for a reasonably-authentic 1980's platformer, YHtWtG will keep you from having to try and make your old copy of Montezuma's Revenge work...

The game is, thankfully, neither, though it teeters on the verge of too easy on the default setting since there's literally no penalty for death.\n\nRegardless of the game's difficulty, the game is really fun. It's a standard platformer that sprawls out further and further as you acquire new items, further jumps, open more doors and spawn more blocks. Sure, it's been done before, but the game is presented with a brilliant retro aesthetic, the control is nice and fluid, it's all swell.\n\nAs stated before, it's borderline too easy, and the more difficult "nine lives" and "YOLO" settings and too frustratingly hard, there's not really a middleground. The only other complaints I have are with it's brevity and it's blandness. It doesn't really bring anything new to the table. Imagine a more vanilla VVVVVVV. It's a lil' boring, but it's a good game and it's free so what do you even want jeez.\n\nPlay it :)","October 21, 2014","true","1.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/liorean/recommended/286100/","liorean","liorean","http://steamcommunity.com/id/liorean/","1129 products in account","This a nostalgic and fair but difficult puzzle platformer I would say belongs in the masocore category (but again, it's fair, unlike some other masocore games such as I Wanna Be The Guy). It's really hard, expect a thousand deaths on your path to the end of the game, where you invariably will lose the first time because you haven't figured the magic word out yet. So you're started from the same place again without your power pickups, where you get to play through the whole thing again in a try to figure the answer out. If that's not enough for you, you can run the game in a cat form, with only nine lives. Or in the YOLO mode. And after that there's a harder remix of the levels for you to try out, again with the earlier mentioned modifications if you find that too easy...\n\nAesthetically, the game hits it's spot. It's got that CGA monitor, scanlines, big pixel, CRT bending, effect to it that looks really authentic. Or if you want to upgrade to an EGA monitor, you can do that, too. If you want to turn off the CRT screen effects, you can do that. The controls are really responsive and smooth, with one little nitpick from me - if you're using a controller, for this kind of platformer I really would like to be able to use the D-pad for movement instead of just the left stick. The D-pad might have it's limitations in directionality, but it's better for twitch changes in directionality.\n\nThe game uses a metroidvanian backtracking reliant room and map design, except of course for being a jumping puzzle platformer and not shooting action platformer. It doesn't have much story, but that is on the other hand very much a symptom of it's time when it comes to the vibe it tried to hit.\n\nDo I recommend it? Yes I do. If Nintendo hard gaming, CGA/EGA era DOS or NES platformer nostalgia is your thing, this is probably a game for you. And of course, you can't beat that price!","May 17, 2014","true","3.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is also rendered in such a way that it simulates playing on an old CRT monitor. And then there is the crazy futuristic option of playing in the sixteen colour CGA mode!! Whaat?\n\nSorry, I'm overly excited because this game is epic! I mean, when I dowloaded it, I thought... I can't expect much from a free game, can I?\n\nBoy... I didn't even realize how much I missed these old-school platformers with their monotone computer sounds, and their evil, unforgiving mechanics.\n\nBasically you traverse numerous rooms, all connected, named differently, sometimes with a hint of what you should/shouldn't do, or a bit of sarcasm. You collect power-ups that in time will allow you to go further, higher, or deeper. You keep moving back and forth, through the same rooms, to check how your new found power-ups will help you to move forward.\n\nWhich is actually pretty horrible for me, since I have no sence of direction and spacial orientation. I keep getting lost, and forgetting where I'm supposed to go. And believe me. This game is difficult enough without a problem like that.\n\nIt is very challenging, you will get lost, you will die continuously (just because sometimes, you have to die to figure out what you should do), and sometimes you will scream out of frustration. There are areas where I died about 50 times before I could move a step forward... and then I would die anyway.\n\nIf you are curious what could kill you, there's spikes, and flames, and crabs, and jellyfish, and water, and loads more. Generally, most of the game can kill you, and will kill you at one point or another.\n\nIf you miss your old-school 8 bit platformers, with their old-school merciless nature, you should give "You have to win the game" a shot. Especially since it's free to play.\n\nAlso there's a cat mode.\n\nAnd YOLO mode, that's also there.","June 4, 2014","true","2.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/liorean/recommended/286100/","liorean","liorean","http://steamcommunity.com/id/liorean/","1129 products in account","This a nostalgic and fair but difficult puzzle platformer I would say belongs in the masocore category (but again, it's fair, unlike some other masocore games such as I Wanna Be The Guy). It's really hard, expect a thousand deaths on your path to the end of the game, where you invariably will lose the first time because you haven't figured the magic word out yet. So you're started from the same place again without your power pickups, where you get to play through the whole thing again in a try to figure the answer out. If that's not enough for you, you can run the game in a cat form, with only nine lives. Or in the YOLO mode. And after that there's a harder remix of the levels for you to try out, again with the earlier mentioned modifications if you find that too easy...\n\nAesthetically, the game hits it's spot. It's got that CGA monitor, scanlines, big pixel, CRT bending, effect to it that looks really authentic. Or if you want to upgrade to an EGA monitor, you can do that, too. If you want to turn off the CRT screen effects, you can do that. The controls are really responsive and smooth, with one little nitpick from me - if you're using a controller, for this kind of platformer I really would like to be able to use the D-pad for movement instead of just the left stick. The D-pad might have it's limitations in directionality, but it's better for twitch changes in directionality.\n\nThe game uses a metroidvanian backtracking reliant room and map design, except of course for being a jumping puzzle platformer and not shooting action platformer. It doesn't have much story, but that is on the other hand very much a symptom of it's time when it comes to the vibe it tried to hit.\n\nDo I recommend it? Yes I do. If Nintendo hard gaming, CGA/EGA era DOS or NES platformer nostalgia is your thing, this is probably a game for you. And of course, you can't beat that price!","May 17, 2014","true","3.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Of course, this is just my mac, it runs perfectly well with anything else, but mine is just kinda a glitched computer.\n\nI recommend this game for those with a skilled mind, those who do not mind eight bit like graphics and those who don't mind new names popping up on every single room. of course, these factors may have put you off the game, so let me tell you some more...\n\nFirstly, steam will be teling you that you already own it. Why you ask? It is a free game. This makes the game very cheap of price, and actually a good gaming standred game at the same time. (Like team fortress two.)\n\nSecoundly, there are three different modes, and two different types of the game to play by. When you press 'start new game' you may notice there are two different things to press. It may be difficult to actually know what to press, you'll figure it out in a few secounds though, unless you button mash. The two types are original and extra spicy, original is basically avarage difficulty and extra spicy... Well, I think most likely hard. Then, the three game modes are original, **** mode, and cat mode. In original mode, you play as a avarage guy, I guess, and you have the avrage standard of lives. In cat mode, you play as a cat, of course, this gives you the advantage of any other character makes you have your elegade nine lives. The other mode? I have not played and i frankly don't want to, but I think you wear sunglasses.\n\nThirdly, this game will lure you into traps some times, a quality everyone loves to see! You may get it confused with a troll game now, but if you do things like a try hard and select **** mode, yes, it kind of is a troll game.\n\nFourthly, no gore, blood, or any of the sort! This is what makes me say, I know this platform it runs on is a use of thirteen or up, but fans of mario would find it suitable to play. This feature means you can easily show any young one you know tis game if you like it, and no costs.\n\nFithly, the makers said something about a sequeal in develepmont. This means maybe once you have completed it you could try the sequeal (if it is out at the time.)\n\nI hope you found this review helpful and you have made your decision weather you want to win the game or not! (Wait a sec... You HAVE to win it!)\n\nCaution; keep away from dogs when selecting mode three.","June 13, 2014","true","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Of course, this is just my mac, it runs perfectly well with anything else, but mine is just kinda a glitched computer.\n\nI recommend this game for those with a skilled mind, those who do not mind eight bit like graphics and those who don't mind new names popping up on every single room. of course, these factors may have put you off the game, so let me tell you some more...\n\nFirstly, steam will be teling you that you already own it. Why you ask? It is a free game. This makes the game very cheap of price, and actually a good gaming standred game at the same time. (Like team fortress two.)\n\nSecoundly, there are three different modes, and two different types of the game to play by. When you press 'start new game' you may notice there are two different things to press. It may be difficult to actually know what to press, you'll figure it out in a few secounds though, unless you button mash. The two types are original and extra spicy, original is basically avarage difficulty and extra spicy... Well, I think most likely hard. Then, the three game modes are original, **** mode, and cat mode. In original mode, you play as a avarage guy, I guess, and you have the avrage standard of lives. In cat mode, you play as a cat, of course, this gives you the advantage of any other character makes you have your elegade nine lives. The other mode? I have not played and i frankly don't want to, but I think you wear sunglasses.\n\nThirdly, this game will lure you into traps some times, a quality everyone loves to see! You may get it confused with a troll game now, but if you do things like a try hard and select **** mode, yes, it kind of is a troll game.\n\nFourthly, no gore, blood, or any of the sort! This is what makes me say, I know this platform it runs on is a use of thirteen or up, but fans of mario would find it suitable to play. This feature means you can easily show any young one you know tis game if you like it, and no costs.\n\nFithly, the makers said something about a sequeal in develepmont. This means maybe once you have completed it you could try the sequeal (if it is out at the time.)\n\nI hope you found this review helpful and you have made your decision weather you want to win the game or not! (Wait a sec... You HAVE to win it!)\n\nCaution; keep away from dogs when selecting mode three.","June 13, 2014","true","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I played for 15 minutes, which may seem short, but in this game that is really all you need (see speed run achievement: "beat game in 10 minutes" ... and not in a mario bros warp through secrets kind of way).\nI didn't play the game to the point where I acquired all the items needed, but played enough to see where it was going (acquired blue and red orbs). I played until the game glitched and I couldn't jump anymore... a pretty critical part where that's the only thing in the game you can do (left, right, jump, press down to go through platform are the controls). I decided it was enough after giving it a fair chance since it really didn't grab me from the start either.\n\nAlthough the visual aspect and old retro tv screen were pretty cool, they are gimmicks that will wear off fast as the game itself doesn't hold up... and even if they were trying to mimic one of the old games, just because they are old doesn't make them good, and there are a lot of aspects/mechanics (even in old games even DOS) lacking in this one.\n\nThe game has a metroid like environment with a couple of branching paths but ultimately it still doesn't feel expansive. The collectibles are just simple money bags with a couple of items needed to make the map more accessible, which doesn't really end up being fun. There are a couple of interesting "fall through the map" type things but they are over way too fast.\n\nEnemies are extremely simple (crab walking back and forth, or stationary creature firing projectiles for you to avoid). There doesn't need to be a way to defeat the enemies, however, it doesn't hurt.\n\nThere is no music (again, just because old games may not have had it, doesn't mean we should take that excuse here, as disabling music in options could be there for real purists).\n\nAll in all, the game feels very empty, And it feels like this game is trying to be VVVVVV in spirit. Yes VVVVVV has a unique up down mechanic, and this game has a regular jumping mechanic, but there's another flaw -- this game has no unique mechanic(s), and like I said, it just feels very bland.\nHowever, VVVVVV is superior in almost every way: music, some semblence of story, bigger map, more interesting map challenges/obstacles.\n\nI may try this game again in the future, but first impressions (15 minutes, 35% through the game (?), red/blue orb collected) are not great. The game isn't bad, but really has no striking features that would make me remember it.","February 19, 2015","false","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I played through it once and got the bad ending.\nMy only real complaint is that there is no music.  unless you are jumping or something's shooting at you, there is no sound whatsoever.

There is not much story to speak of, but it isn't necessarily the most important part of this kind of game - the title describes the objective, and a counter in the bottom right hand corner describes the win condition.\n\nIt's easy to see where the developer has gotten his inspiration from (among others VVVVVV and Super Meat Boy (and, while I'm not quite sure as it might have gotten inspiration from the same sources, I might want to add I Wanna Be The Guy to the list, too).\n\nThe game is hard for pretty much the same reasons VVVVVV is hard - it's difficult to remember how to get where, and it's easy to get lost in the numerous level screens. Some parts of the game requires some "grinding" (if that's an appropriate term to use for trying again and again in a platformer), and some levels are pretty boring to do after a while. But the save-points are plentiful, and collection of money/artifacts/things are saved upon collection.\n\nAll in all, a really good game. It took me 1 hour and 50 minutes to get to the end without losing, and completing the game 100% took me 2 hours and 10 minutes (that means 20 minutes extra from my first, any%, win to my second, 100%, win. After this, I have three achievements left, which I'm going to go finish pretty soon. Other than getting 100% of the achievements, it doesn't look like there is a lot of replayability, as much of what makes the game great is the exploration.  However, it could be a fun game to run through once in a while, just to see if you remember every level and how to do them.\n\nIf you like this game, I'd recommend also checking out VVVVVV, Eversion, and I Wanna Be The Guy. This game reminded me a lot of those three, and I have enjoyed all three of them a lot, just like I did with this one.","September 24, 2014","true","2.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

He can fall from any heigh and keep walking but if he touches spikes, flames, baddies he'll die instantly but come back to life at the nearest check point.\n\nLike the classic adventure game, you'll need to initiative and start exploring and along the way you'll see bags of gold in different colours and everytime you pick one up your percenatge at the bottom of the screen increases. Obviously, You want to achieve 100% so this will you keep you looking further and sometimes you get lost of track and just like to explore new areas.\n\nNot only do you discover treasures but you also find new abilities for your character, I'm not going to say much but sometimes your curiosity will reward you if you ask your self "How do I access that area?"\n\nI personally had a lot of fun, and Im still keen to play on. The CRT computer monitor can be turned off too so you can play the game with a flat screen and even change the colours around to emulate the Amiga. and It's free too so..\n\nYou have to play this game.\n","February 15, 2015","true","2.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

For those saying the levels are too sparse, I can only reply with "You weren't there, man..." meaning it's a characteristic of games from this era, and works perfectly (yeah, I know games like VVVVVV do things a bit differently).  The sense of loneliness is down to individual interpretation.\n\nAnd as for those who say it's too easy, leaving reviews saying they completed it with a play time of less than an hour... well, you must be much better gamers than I am, because it took me the best part of an hour to even explore most of the game.  Really, I'm not sure how you managed it if you weren't following a walkthrough.

And if it's not your thing, thank goodness you get to sample it for no financial investment.\n\nI can't help but feel a bit sad at some of the negative reviews.  For those saying the levels are too sparse, I can only reply with "You weren't there, man..." meaning it's a characteristic of games from this era, and works perfectly (yeah, I know games like VVVVVV do things a bit differently).  The sense of loneliness is down to individual interpretation.\n\nAnd as for those who say it's too easy, leaving reviews saying they completed it with a play time of less than an hour... well, you must be much better gamers than I am, because it took me the best part of an hour to even explore most of the game.  Really, I'm not sure how you managed it if you weren't following a walkthrough.  In which case, you've missed the point, and should've allowed yourselves the opportunity to discover things along the way, it's all part of the enjoyment.\n\nBut to each his or her own.  Grab now.

The controls are responsive and the gameplay feels fluent. Jump around, collect moneybags, find the secret word, find the secret symbol, and then, ultimately, You Have to Win the Game.\n\nThe game reminds me a little of VVVVVV, even tho YHTWTG isn't as difficult. The exploration ascpect is strong in both games.\n\nYou have the option to play with infinite lives, 9 lives or 1 life (the latter are not for the faint of heart). You also have the option to play with CRT-simulation, which is very cool. I have it on, by the way.\n\n\nI'd recommend this game to anyone who is looking for an old school-ish and semi-hard platformer and I'll definitely add this game to my list of favourite platformers.\n\nAnd lastly, holy cow, this game is free!

The developers took much care in making sure the presentation and gameplay are genuine to the mid 1980s PC style of platformers. The controls are easy to use and the artwork is themed well. As a totally free title, this game is a welcome addition to the genre even though there isn't too much content nor a storyline to speak of. There is fun to be had here and you won't feel like you wasted your time. Unless... the ending bothers you as it did me. Without mentioning any spoilers, I feel it's necessary to at least say that the end-game "puzzle" feels out of place and I personally didn't like it at all. It really didn't have to be included in the game. I understand the developers felt like the finale had to be brought together somehow but the puzzle they decided on really feels like it doesn't belong in this game at all. Besides this final "puzzle", the game was enjoyable, if only a bit shallow and without any music.

While i have played games like Super Meatboy and Mechanic Escape as well as other indie titles that have had insanely hard platforming skills this one does a very well done job of making the game seem like an old PC game but making it still cool to play for the modern age. you go around collecting money bags the more you collect the further your progression. Along the way you'll encounter enemies using bullet hell style attacks. Your character cannot attack so do your best to dodge them, as well as the hundreds of spikes and other creatures in the game. This is a game I think everyone she be getting especially cause its a platformer thats made very tightly with literally perfect percision and controls mapped with excellent timing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/286100/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account",""Hardcore" retro platformers have been making something of a comeback in recent years, thanks in large part to Super Meat Boy's success, and the DOS inspired You Have to Win the Game is the latest to join the batch of games designed to make you grit your teeth as you die again and again...in theory.\n\nPutting you in a (mostly) nonlinear metroidvania world, you hop your way around exploring and collecting upgrades to progress further, to eventually do exactly what the title says. There's very little more to say in that regard as YHtWtG isn't trying to do anything new and knows this, acting more as a diversion than something you'll continue to talk about after the 30-60 minutes it takes you to finish it.\n\nIt plays decently, with functional controls that I didn't hinder my advancement or cause me any great difficulty, and is for the most part is fairly average at what it does. There is nothing particularly noteworthy I can say for or against it, but that's also because so much of the game consists of...nothing. Room after room I entered greeted me with rarely a trap or platform to be seen, allowing me to leisurely walk from one side to the other only to find much of the same waiting for me when I entered the next screen. There's little challenge to be found here aside from a few obnoxiously placed traps, but the lack of any map and the convoluted nature of the environment means a great deal of patience is still required to finish the game (less you fall asleep on account of the tedium of backtracking through every screen looking for the passage you missed). The lack of any soundtrack only adds to the emptiness, almost as if the developer was intentionally designing the experience to make you to feel cold and alone.\n\nAs a game that aspires to be something that twists your fingers into knots and causes you to curse your monitor in rage, You Have to Win the Game is a shockingly easy adventure that leaves little if any impression. I can't say it's bad, but for every second I spent playing it I had to ask myself: what was the point? If you have a likening for oldschool platformers and need to kill an hour, you could definitely do worse than YHtWtG, but I can't help but feel that those with more limited free time would be better off spending it elsewhere.","May 11, 2014","false","0.8"," 56 of 117 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","56","117","0","4"

It displays my videogame taste yours may be diffrent please don't be offendet by it.\n\nFirst of all the title i don't have to do anything and that is not the right message you could send to your players. The titel looks like the title of a game on kongregate or newgounds (i don't have anything against this sites). And then the game just tryes tom act like it would be "retro" (It probably looks silly if you actually have a 4:3 tube-monitor) and it is that kind of "retro" that tries to facade bad art skills in my opinion. You can turn the annoyuing glare and scanline-simulation off though. It is still very pixely but at least is nicer to look at then in my opinion.\n\nI only played it a little bit but from what i saw there wasn't much to it.

The game is also relatively glitch-free. Because the game is made in the style of traditional platformers, newcomers may not be familiar with the idea of 'hitboxes' and 'states'. As such, newcomers will find spikes frustrating because 'they didn't hit it', or because 'they didn't know they could touch it'. Newcomers will also find it difficult to land on some platforms; they assume they can't jump while in mid-air.\n\nI'll be honest, the game is well-designed, well-coded, and definitely worth playing. That said, it is a homage to the platforming genre and carries many of the frustrating game mechanics that turn off newcomers to the genre. The quality is very high, as far as the genre goes. The colour palette is well chosen, also.\n\nIf you enjoy games like Mario, Metroid, Ninja Gaiden, and Castlevania, you'll probably enjoy this game.\nIf you don't, then don't play this game.\nAnd if you've never played a platformer, give this a shot; it's free, and is a great introduction to one of the earliest game genres.","February 27","false","0.4"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","0"

You're giving "You Have to Win the Game" a thumbs down, but you gave VVVVVV a thumbs up!? Where is your logic! I don't see it on you! Are you even human?\n\nYes, I didn't care for "You Have to Win the Game" as much, yet I still enjoy playformers like VVVVVV. Why? Well, it's very simple. And I'll explain that in a second. YHtWtG is really good on graphics. The purples (or I  guess reds, as the game calls them), are beautiful to look at. The challenge is acceptable, emulating the same fair-checkpoint system that VVVVVV had. But I personally thought that THtWtG was just a little stale. It felt too much like every other platformer I'd played, with the same tight controls as VVVVVV. It just didn't stick out as much to me. I feel like it would've been a lot stronger if the bosses were actually bosses instead of hazards like every other enemy in the world, and that you'd get your powers for double-jump and spider-climb at the beginning and that the whole game was centered around you unlocking new blocks for places for you to explore.\n\nI also don't like the win/lose portion at the end. If I've played through the whole game and gotten to the end, I'd like some form of recognition, but you can only win or lose from some arbitrary secret-word game.\n\nNow, some of my complaints stop very quickly, because the game is free. And, yes, it is fun. But aside from the lack of memorability, or charm, or real humor (besides the VVVVVV-esque way of titling your screen something clever)... "You Have to Win the Game" just doesn't impress me.","January 22","false","1.3"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

The game is deliberately evocative of ages past, and contains various standard platforming puzzles.\n\nStory\n\nThe game has no story.\n\nGameplay\n\nAt the start of the game, the character can do two things – move, and jump. Over the course of the game, the character also unlocks the ability to double jump and to wall jump, as well as activating red and blue walkway bricks; all four of these things open up new places for the player to go. The platforming starts out pretty easy, but gets progressively more difficult throughout the game. There are no bottomless pits in the game, but as per usual, there is lava and spikes.\nEnemies in the game exist, but there are only a very small variety of them; however, this isn’t really a problem as the game is so short and the gameplay so basic. Touching any enemy is instant death, and there are fundamentally two kinds of “normal” enemies, creatures which crawl on the ground (snakes and crabs) and creatures which fly through the air (bats). In addition, there are a small number of unique monsters which spit out patterns of projectiles that the player must navigate through to win.\nMost of the gameplay consists of exploring the environment, collecting all 64 money bags (though 5 of them are actually hearts instead, they serve the same purpose), unlocking all of the abilities, and navigating through to the end of the game, where there is a little mini-puzzle which allows you to “win” if you solve it. Winning or losing brings up a short message on screen, then sends you back to the beginning of the game without any upgrades, but all of the other collectibles remain collected.\nThe platforming is very basic, and overall the gameplay is very evocative of older platformer games, with very simple gameplay that isn’t anything special, but does what it needs to do. Unlike older platformers, are bells scattered throughout the game which serve as checkpoints, and their extremely high frequency means that the player is never sent back too far if they die; in this sense, the game is rather evocative of VVVVVV, in that the platforming deaths have little consequence because you can immediately try again, which is a good thing as it reduces frustration. The game gets to be fairly difficult by the end of it, but even still, the game is quite short; 100%ing the game took me under two hours, and to do that, you must beat it twice.\n\nGraphics\n\nThe game is meant to look like it is being played on a computer out of the 1980s, and the game does a great job of achieving exactly that. This means, however, it isn't really very pretty to look at, though it is mostly reasonably clear what is going on; a few of the money bags are deliberately hidden by maching the surrounding colors closely, which is a somewhat questionable decision from the point of view of collectability, as all the others are simply hard to get to, whereas those two are easy to simply never see in the first place.\n\nFinal Summary\n\nYou Have To Win The Game is exactly what it promises to be – a retro platformer out of the 1980s. It isn’t the best platformer ever, but it is competent enough. However, there’s really nothing to recommend it either – if you miss out on this game, you aren’t missing anything from your life. If you get a free copy and are bored, you might get some enjoyment out of it, but there’s a reason games have moved on from such basic mechanics – they’re too limited to really grab you and leave you feeling as if you’ve done something new.\n","September 25, 2014","false","2.4"," 8 of 23 people (35%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","35","8","23","0","0"

This game could have been released in 1990 without any alterations, and perfectly blend with other games of that era.\nBut aside from that (questionable) achievement, the game has little to offer. It has no new mechanics, no interesting features, no exciting gameplay, not even story or graphics or any other means of being special. It's just the experience of old-fashioned maze-like platformers with no map, but rage-inducing jumping sequences that have to be done over and over again (and then you find out that you have to complete that sequence several times more later). Thankfully the game has a lot of checkpoints, so you don't have to restart from the very beginning every time (unless you chose the YOLO mode).\n\nStrangely I don't even feel true nostalgia from playing this game. I'd call this feeling 'fake nostalgia': turns out it's not CGA graphics or story-deprived convoluted platformers I miss, but the feeling of discovery and novelty from playing such games in my youth.

This game is very challenging, play it if you like that and don't if you hate a challenge in reflexes and patience.  Especially don't try to do a 'Let's Play' like I did the week a paper is due or something like that; doing an extra college class during the summer while recording my impressions of this game was excruciating.  This game is best played when everything you have to do in real life settles down and should be especially enjoyable if you have plenty of spare time and friends to watch you fail (I'm assuming).  Don't play this game if you're impatient, since some of the stages will entrap you in infinite loops if you go the wrong way, require an adequate level of dexterity and a good sense of timing.  The game has no music, so hearing the only three sound effects this game has to offer played over and over can get annoying at times -if not drive you insane.  I know people like this game since as of this posting, the game's rating is ranked at 'very positive' but I would rather express my partial disdain for playing this, since this game has loads of potential but fell short of my expectations.  If you want a hard platformer that's more stimulating, and actually has challenges you can remotely solve on your own, try Eryi's Action (also available on Steam) instead.  Let me warn you that you can only win the game if you can descipher the markings in some of the stages and figure out what the magic word is using the code, so good luck trying to figure that out before googling it like everyone else (if you must know the magic word is 'super,' because you have to be supremely patient and determined to win this).

This game is a little iffy on my list. I would  recommend this game if it wasn't so complicated. I was roaming around for 3 hours trying to figure out where to go, and I had to turn on ghost blocks and I thought, ok, I found it!, but no, I had to turn on another set of ghost blocks, and still figure out where to go. Its not that its not fun, its just frustrating. I would give it a 3 out of 5 because I do admit that it has its pros as well, and I can't get over the look of an old fashioned platformer that looks somewhat like.....OH NO!

One of my favourite pc platformers ever. So this is a good one just for that. But it does have a few issues about it. Where in the HELL do I go? Do I YOLOmcSWAG into this bottomless pit? Do I sit here and bang my head into my palm a couple times? And another thing, it feels like my guy's gonna go into outer space when I jump. I think he wants to grab Wheatley, that's how floaty it feels to me. And, yes, I may like the occasional floaty jump in a game where there's no, so to speak, specific platforming areas!

Maybe.  Unfortunately, YHTWTG manages to fail at trying to provide a *good* retro experience.  The game can be frustrating, borderline cheap at times, and while I have no problem with difficult games, I like games to be fair as well.  There's also virtually no soundtrack, which just makes the game boring to go through.  Coupled with the game's frustrating difficulty spikes, this severly hampered my enjoyment with YHTWTG.  There's also the lack of a map, or really, just any direction.\n\nWe're not in the 80s anymore; people shouldn't be making games like this.\n\nThis game is obviously very "inspired" by VVVVVV, with all the spikes, the high difficulty/low playtime, and every room being named.  VVVVVV did things right; it had hard, but fair gameplay, it wasn't confusing, and it actually had a soundtrack (and a damn good one at that).  So, in summary, YHTWTG tries to be VVVVVV, but ends up being the opposite, much to my dismay.\n\nIt wasn't a totally negative experience, but I wouldn't recommend the game, even though it's free.\n\nEdit: Oh, and how could I forget?  Another thing about the soundtrack is that the trailer for the game on Steam has music playing, but like I've said, there's barely any music in the game.  I find that to be somewhat misleading, honestly, and it's a shame that there's little music, as the tune for the trailer is actually not half bad.","December 14, 2014","false","1.5"," 1 of 11 people (9%) found this review helpful","9","1","11","0","3"

This game is so hard, it can make you kill your computer (Which I almost did, sorry computer) There;s this part where it's impossible, and tedious as hell. You have to get on the moving platform up and down, and wait for the perfect moment to get to another moving platform, which has a bat on top, which also has a double spiked block. It's impossible, I've almost got it, yet it the spikes at the bottom, oh, I didn't mention those, killedme. Which is no fun in situations like these. I deleted the game right after this.\n\nWell, in games like Megaman, there may be some hard moments, but you can beat it after. This game you can't. Mega man also gives you health. I thought I put yhtwtg on easy. If you need to make a game this hard, add a ♥♥♥♥ing health bar.\n\nI'd rather play dalmatians 3 or snow white and the seven clever boys.\n\nI can't even give this a rating.

I know, that's what a game is suppost to be. being Easy is worst than being hard. but there is a difference between being hard and being WHATTHEACTUAL♥♥♥♥ rediculous. I have no clue why games like this are popular, it's just the developer deciding to not care about the player at all. Don't get me wrong, there are some nice parts of this game that I really enjoyed and that were really fun, but it's all forgotten when you spend forever trying to time your jump just so that you land on the platform, but miss the spike and the bat, then the milisecond you land on the moving platform, also jump and move forward, again dodging the bat, and then jumping down before it goes backwards and kills you, making your start again. If you're in to punishment with little or no reward, than you might like this game. it does have good replayability and I do like the retro style (nice touch with the screen btw.) but there is only so much I can enjoy a game that knock you down and beats you with a stick again, and again, and again, and again, and again...you get the picture.","May 31, 2014","false","0.6"," 0 of 9 people (0%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","0","9","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/novakza/recommended/286100/","novakza","NOVA","http://steamcommunity.com/id/novakza/","192 products in account","I typically like difficult games, and the game is noticably going for a very "VVVVVV" feel--each screen has it's own title, it has a similar scanline filter, and so on. VVVVVV was one of my favorite games, so I was initially very impressed. And it was free, so I had to try it!\n\nThe one, killing flaw: No music. No sound what so ever aside from the occasional death noise. I hate to put it like this, but the poor sound direction absolutely destroyed the game.\n\nAs steam forced me to play for a while in order to write a review, I played for around 7 minutes. In doing so, I already passed by the first "boss", and according to the game, I'm already 25% finished. I understand it's free, but I've played 2 dollar games for 10 hours--it feels simply wrong to finish that much of ANY game in that little amount of time.\n\nI think the developer knows a little bit of what they're doing, but I'm guessing they're a single person team. Just in case they read this, let me hammer this in: GET A SOUND GUY. Make your game longer. And then, honest to god, I'd pay 10 bucks for it. But as it is, I can find flash games that entertain me more (Pause Ahead comes to mind).","May 8, 2014","false","0.1"," 21 of 55 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","21","55","0","0"

For someone who plays a lot of these I can understand the appeal of trying this one out, to give yourself a bit of a refresher but you'll feel like you're playing a weird mod of VVVVVV. The title of this game seems more like a way for you to be pulled into it, I feel like if it had a more conventional name then the game might have to put more focus into the world having a cohesive connection with a story.\n\nThis is not a terrible game by any means, it feels like someone tried to mash VVVVVV and super meat boy together, that's a noble effort. I can't imagine the amount of hours that have gone into making this game and the time it took for the developers to learn the skills they have to make this thing possible. However the more time I put into this game I keep wanting to experience something that is more fleshed out.\n\nIt's not something I would recommend to fans of platformers because they've probably experienced something better would likely find this mediocre.\n\nI also could not recommend this to someone who's getting into video games or this genre.\n\n(I've played the non-steam versions, i have spent more than 2 hours on this game)","May 9, 2014","false","2.4"," 3 of 16 people (19%) found this review helpful","19","3","16","0","1"

At first you will think that this reveiw was bad and how easy you got through the first 5 levels but then once you go past thge first boss you will think of this review and how correct i was. If you want a good summary of this game: It's about a boy (that you never ever get to know his name) that goes in freaking caves and jumps like a hare and not fighting (yes not fighting) bosses but he simply walks around them to just take there reward then you gotta collect 100 coins or whatever and hearts with like eye patches on the hearts (makes no sense) and do these imposible jumps that will take at least millions of attemps to make then you have to go and explore this map with the exact same textures for all items and then youdo even more crap to get to that one coin that will take a year to get. Once you get the coin you must find a freakin exit whitch will take an extra year to complete once you collect all the coins ( whitch i havent even made it to the end for countless whining and rages) and you win the game. The funnest thing about this game is that there is a yolo mode (yes a ♥♥♥♥ing yolo mode) : Once you acheve you're happeness level by hacking the game to noclip to the end you must have 1 (yes 1) (yep 1) life to complete the whoooooole game (do they think even 1 person even made it to the end?) and there is also an achevment that I guess was just to troll people was that you had to complete the game in 10 minutes. Yes 10 freaking minutes. So if you agree with me that this game is just plain imposible tell me and i will make an appointment to the phycologist so we can both take about how this game affected our lives","November 2, 2014","false","2.1"," 6 of 24 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","6","24","0","3"

Your character is a "one hit wonder", and your job is to finish the game. Along with collectable power ups to help you out, you will need to remember the "special" word hidden in the level to "win the game". Otherwise, you will lose.\n\nThere are several modes to help with the replayability: Yolo mode disables the checkpoint system, making the entire game a no hit run; cat mode gives you only nine lives before you die. There is a "spicy" campaign that increases the difficulty by a ten fold; just the thought of it and Yolo mode makes be quiver.\n\nIt reminds me of Super Meat Boy, though with none of the high speed.

Its tribute to the games of the bygone CGA era shows the passion the developer has for games and technology. Personally, I preferred the "red" color scheme over the "pink", and I also played with the CRT setting off. The only thing I felt was missing was background music. This is understandable though as many 80s PC games couldn't push out more than sound effects due to technical limitations. Playing this game has sky-rocketed its sequel, "Super Win the Game" to the TOP of my Wishlist. It is just that damn fun.

Honestly, I don't know why it's free, because it is awesome, and the developer could easily make some good money off it. If you like platformers like Super Meat Boy or VVVVVV (which you should, because they are awesome), then you will like this game. It has cool retro graphics (like something off the Gameboy or earlier), and it's not as difficult as SMB or VVVVVV. It has a mechanic pretty similar to VVVVVV, where your screen displays one room at a time, all of which have different names (alternately cryptic, humorous, obscure, or just wierd). There are also save points in most rooms like in VVVVVV. There were just a couple times where the save points were a little too far apart, which was somewhat annoying when I got stuck at a hard part and kept having to play the same 3-4 screens over and over, but this was pretty infrequent. The music is mostly non-existent, except for some jumping sound effects and such, but that's ok. It adds to the retro asthetic.\n\nI played through a good portion of the game with a keyboard, which is certainly doable, but eventually I got to a part where I just knew it would be easier with a controller, so I played the rest that way. The game has some cool surprises, especially at the end. Figuring out the "magic word" and the "magic number" really isn't too difficult, but it is rewarding when you get it. Also, choosing to "lose" the game is also funny, although I recommend winning first, since you lose all your powers and start at the beginning when you lose (but you keep all the stuff you've found).\n\nAnyway, you should definitely give this game a shot. It's short and sweet, but the price is definitely right. For what it is, I give it 9/10.","January 3, 2015","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even though (for a rage platform game) it's very light and not too difficult as you can eventually find out the tricks to get past every little 'level', keep in mind that it can still make you rage, so I prefer to reach a checkpoint after finishing a particularly hard bit and take a break.\n\nThe graphics are amazing. Even though it can't have been that hard to make and it probably took a few weeks (days, even), the classy retro look makes it somehow friendlier than some other difficult platform games. I also like the fact that the game isn't mean, or evil, but it still makes you rage. It actually tries to help you. Top tip: Always look at the bottom of the screen; you will find the 'title' of each 'level'. This title will sometimes help you, especially when you're trying to figure out which way to go.\n\nTo conclude, I recommend this game, as it is short but sweet, simple, retro-style, friendly, FREE, and it only takes up 8MB on your computer!","March 12, 2015","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
