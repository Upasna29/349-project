Well, some may argue it's only the third real Call of Juarez game, since the previous one, Call of Juarez: The Cartel, did have a rather different and more modern-day background. As The Cartel did not get a particularly positive reaction, many thought the series had went off-track. But they were far from the truth: with Gunslinger, Techland has for me made not only the best game in the series, but probable the best Far West-shooter ever. A bold statement, so let me explain in detail.\n\nThe concept of the game is original and well thought-off. You play as the bounty-hunter Silas Greaves, who tells his story in a Far West-saloon to a bunch of regular customers. As his story unfolds, it soon becomes clear Silas has a penchant to exagerrate some parts of it, which is why his  story is more and more questioned by his audience. This idea of "truth or false" is cleverly catched upon by the collectible items that are to be found throughout the game. These "nuggets of truth" give a fairly detailed amount of information on the history of the Far West, its main protagonists and some lesser-known historical facts.  The entire game provides prove of the love of Techland's crew for this setting: every bit of it, from the very easy to manage menu's right up to the credits, bathes in a unique Old West-style. There are countless references to the history of 19th-century America, and to the influence this period had on later arts such as literature and, ofcourse, movies.\n\nAs for the actual gameplay: it leans more towards an arcade shooter than towards a tactical or realistic game. There is a fair arsenal of weapony, each with some characteristics of their own, but most enemies go down easily and swiftly. What makes the shooting really fun, is the idea of the "combo": whenever you manage to shoot several enemies in a row, a multiplier comes into play, so that your experience-points go up that much faster. Getting one more kill in a row so becomes a goal of its own. Since experience-points are connected to a clever system of levelling-up and gaining interesting skills, getting longer kill-streaks soons becomes a true challenge. Added to these are two special effects: bullet-time, triggered by special shots like headshots or piercing shots, and the "sense of death", which allows you to dodge bullets at the last moment. Boss fights come in two types: normal ones against more powerful foes, but also as typical Old West-duels, in which a totally different method of playing is needed. These feel a bit trial-and-error at first, but after some practice, still can provide their share of the fun. And they provide great links to several Westerns, starring the great Hollywood-heroes of decades ago.\n\nGraphically, Call of Juarez: Gunslinger is very good-looking. The game uses a comics-style with cel-shaded graphics, loosely comparable to the Borderlands-series. Enemy-animations are fairly standard, and enemies don't come in that much varieties. However, these are minor criticisms, since the game comes at a very acceptable price, although it has the scope and content of a true AAA-title. After finishing the main story (which took me about 8 hours), there's a New Game Plus-mode, very useful to collect the XP needed in order to unlock all of the skills, and a True West-difficulty, in which most of the HUD is disabled.\nVery entertaining is the Arcade-mode, in which ten of the games' maps can be replayed with as sole objectivity to get as much points as possible by making very long kill-streaks. Since the Steam-integration also comprises global leaderbords, tihs is great fun as I tried to get up the rankings a bit.\n\nGameplay: 26/30\nGraphics: 17/20\nSound: 8/10\nTechnical stability: 9/10\nLongelivety: 8/10 (thanks to the several difficulty-levels and the Arcade mode)\nSteam Integration: 10/10 (really perfectly done, with a great bunch of achievements that let you discover several special aspects of the game - and do try to collect all of the "nuggets of truth"!)\nPersonal appreciation: 10/10 (I just LOVE this game)\n\nOverall score: 88/100\nCall of Juarez: Gunslinger is one the best games I've yet played this year. It's a great, arcade-type shooter, with much more content hidden just below the surface. It's unique low-price makes this a must-buy!","September 22, 2014","true","29.0"," 146 of 154 people (95%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","95","146","154","7","7"

The levels are narrow and the mechanics are simple, but the overall experience is downright riotous. It is designed to simultaneously feel comfortingly familiar and adventurously fresh. Put simply: it is a very easy-to-digest FPS game that boasts a strong and unique identity. Both established fans of the genre and those who are generally on the fence would be wise to give this game strong consideration.\n\nCall of Juarez®: Gunslinger embraces the Wild West  of the late 19th and early 20th century for its setting and atmosphere, with a jovial emphasis on the “Wild” part. The graphic style is in the same vein as that of Borderlands, although slightly more realistic; but the overall ambiance is definitely more focused on fun than realism. And the narrative is great. It is funny and compelling, it flows at a very enjoyable pace, and it touches on “real” folktales from the Wild West era. But more than that, the style of storytelling used in the game is exceptionally well-crafted and delivered near perfectly, with excellent voice acting. It comes together to establish an outstanding presentation.\n\nAs for the actual gameplay, it is admittedly quite limited compared to some modern FPS games. There isn’t much variety to your arsenal, enemies, or to the level designs. However, there are great fundamentals inherent to the game. The gameplay is fun. It really is. There is pretty much nonstop action, and the firefights are always exciting. The game features a slow-mo power aspect, or as it is frequently called, “bullet-time.” And you are rewarded for scoring high combos during the firefights by receiving more bullet-time energy and exponentially more experience points. As you gain levels from those experience points, you can unlock passive abilities that make you more deadly. It is a simple system, but it is rewarding. As for the levels, they don’t allow much exploration or alternate pathing, and are mostly narrow. But since the game is highly story-driven, it is a fitting design choice.\n\nProbably the most defining feature of the game, (and franchise), is the dueling minigame. It can be frustrating at first, but after you learn some of the intricacies it becomes easy and pretty fun. There are duels peppered throughout the campaign in the form of boss encounters, and there is also an auxiliary duel mode in a score-attack style. The dueling feature is a leading contributor of the game’s charming and unique identity.\n\nThe game runs on a checkpoint system where the checkpoints are both frequent and effective. There is also a level-select option that lets you replay certain levels at any time. As always, I would still prefer the option to save manually; but in Call of Juarez®: Gunslinger the system used is quite adequate and due to the linear nature of the levels, will never set you back more than a minute.\n\nIt all adds up to an undoubtedly enjoyable experience. It isn’t a very long or sizable game by any means, but the campaign is very fun and has decent replay value. I can easily recommend this to all fans of the genre, big and small, new and old. If it looks like something you would enjoy, it probably is.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","February 24","true","12.9"," 106 of 113 people (94%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","94","106","113","4","9"

Besides the campaign there are other 2 modes Arcade and Duels where you can compete with your Steam friends for the highest scores.\nNow the downside, there is no multiplayer/Co-op whatsoever and it would’ve been nice if they had added some kind of horse experience, after all what’s a western without that?

My only gripe is, that the game is too short. Most of you will beat this in around 6 hours. But considering the low price, this is absolutely fair. Especially because you'll want to replay it immediatly after finishing it. At least thats how it went for me. Call of Juarez:Gunslinger is a very linear western shooter, that doesn't have anything in common with the other CoJ games.Exept for the setting of course. It tells a very interesting and humorous story, wich makes you laugh while exploding enemys in Over-the-top blood fountains. The artstyle is comicy and creates some beautiful scenerys, while you listen to the fitting soundtrack.\nNow for the interesting part: The gunplay in this game is mindblowing. Lining up a row of headshots has never been more satisfying. The weapon arsenal is not really big, but you'll find something for your taste and stick with it.\nSo, in conclusion, if you like FPS Games at all, if you like a well told story and a good laugh, buy this game and thank me later :)\nSincerely,\nFISTING SANTA","November 25, 2013","true","14.2"," 109 of 121 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","109","121","0","1"

There are no sidequests, no puzzles, no npc:s to talk with, just headshots after another.\n\nThe two main hooks for me were the satisfying gunplay with guns that feel like they make an impact. And the revenge story told by the protagonist who acts as an unreliable narrator. Some scenes you need to play again, because the story didn't happen as it was told the first time.\n\nFor the guns, you get to choose from revolvers, rifles and shotguns. Skills for these weapons can also be upgraded by gaining experience points. Headshots, combos and double kills give more xp than normal kills.\n\nEnvironments felt a bit stale and repetitive. Which is also highlighted by the lack of civilians in the few town maps.\n\nThere's also a "bullet time" mechanic that you can use, in which the time almost completely freezes and enemies turn red for easier spotting. During that you can take your time to line up a nice headshot combo. This is limited by energy bar that refills with kills.\n\nMany boss fights felt a bit boring when those were just horde of enemies and/or one really resilient enemy on top of that. But sometimes you get to duel in a stand off which is nice change of pacing. In these you need to keep focus on the enemy with your mouse and get your draw hand in better position with the keyboard.\n\nCall of Juarez is really simple and short but still quite fun game. Recommended for fans of westerns and corridor shooters.\n\n[Score: 75]","April 28, 2015","true","5.2"," 82 of 88 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","82","88","3","4"

I can't remember the last time I started an FPS and "couldn't put it down" as is the case with this one.\n\nEven the most experienced players will find plenty of fun and challenge here.  The role-playing/skill-up elements add to what would otherwise still be a very good FPS, and the "nuggets" of wild west history are just icing on the cake and all interesting reads.  I actually couldn't wait to read each one after I found them.  Be careful you may end up researching old west history after playing this game.\n\nThe boss fights are fought both in traitional fps style, and in old-west style "duels".  The "dueling" mechanics are well-done, a nice change of pace for "boss fights" and add a whole new fun element to the "old-west" atmosphere of this title.\n\nAll that is available just in "story" mode, but there are 2 separate "arcade/challenge" modes as well in which you compete for scores.  In "arcade" mode you get to beome a one-man murder-machine as you blast your way through really fun shortened levels from the story mode, trying to gain as many points as possible.  There is a separate XP bank in this mode for each of 3 archetypes you can choose (basically rifle, shotgun or pistol style) and skills in this mode are gained automatically as you complete the challenges, all of which can be replayed infinitely for more xp if you want.\nIn "duel" mode you are given 5 lives to survive as many duels as possible, all presented in order and taken from story mode.\n\nI'd write more, but I have to get back to the frontier right now pilgrim.

Until I started Gunslinger, I thought it was done to boost sells for the game from the series which fate was uncertain after unsuccessful Cartel. But that's not the point. In fact, now I'm in doubts which one of those two bundled games is more providing with the spirit of the 80's.\n\nRemember the scene from the "Back to the Future 2", where Marty plays the Wild Gunman in the cafe? Gunslinger is all about that sequence. Where Far Cry Blood Dragon is the modern FPS filled with neon and such landmarks and tombstones of the past as "VHS"... Gunslinger is only looking as a modern game. In fact, it is just an arcade with cowboys shooting each other for a fistful of bucks or without any reason at all. "Ma foi, je me bats parce que je me bats", said Portos... and this bravado stays in our blood, no matter how civilized we are.\n\nThere won't be cool distinctive features of the generous western shooters such as the Call of Juarez 1&2. No real-deal ballistics, no such variety of tools and gameplay sequences... You just run'n'gun, but boy, that one is pure and delightful experience! Some people blame new showdowns... certainly they wouldn't stand even 10 levels in the Wind Gunman (and I was good behind the 100th level on my NES back in time).\n\nSo - yeah - I like the game just as it goes. Fair challenge, fair experience, fair price... Nice story and solid gameplay. Good Western show on your PC, and I think it is much better than you can get from the Disneyland tour or just idle watching young Eastwood or Bogart movies.

Not only because you are playing the Story as it is being told but how the Story is told. Because you are narrating your own story, sometimes you need to rewind to make the Story accurate in case you mess up or your listeners say something "is that how it really happened?". While the Story is not necessary big I guess you can extend it by looking through all the collectibles or by increasing the difficulty. As for my play through, the things that always took me more time to do were the duels, usually in the end of each Chapter. You need to pay attention to your focus on the target as well you speed to draw your revolver. This is a very clever idea and it really gives you a tense moment showing some good old West one-on-one combat.\n\nThe visuals are really nice. Every now and then I had to stop for a bit after the killing to enjoy the scenery. It's not only the visuals that grabbed my time but the attention to the little details made playing this game a even more enjoyable experience. You can see that they put some time to make the city, the lake or the forest just like it was supposed to be back then. In my opinion they nailed in the setting. I always enjoyed the West duels and this time of the year in the History. The duels show how honor was something important back then and I grew more fond of these weapons (revolver) in games.\n\nIn the end it was a good game and the thing that stands out the most is not the Story but how it is told. I thought it was pretty clever pushing your way while hearing your own voice, aiming for head shots in slow motion and throwing some dynamite. Oh and when you make a clean kill and blow the fumes from the pipe of your revolver? Priceless.","February 17, 2014","true","5.5"," 60 of 70 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","60","70","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/antimagicSA/recommended/204450/","antimagicSA","anti-magic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/antimagicSA/","448 products in account","One of the few first person shooters where I would say that the story and it's presentation far outstrip the gameplay, which is a significant achievement when you consider just how tight it is. The actual story itself is not complicated or morally challenging, but the use of an unreliable narrator combined with how the game itself reacts to when he backtracks to redescribe certain details is both amusing and engrossing. It cannot be overstated just how enjoyable the game is for it's presentation alone.\n\nWhile the gameplay does not push boundaries it is dependable and will prove both challenging and fun. Essentially there are three gameplay types based both on guns and the skills associated with them: shotguns, pistols and rifles. Skills are attained through scoring points which you obtain by killing enemies: pulling off headshots, performing multiple kills in a row, long distance shots, on the run kills will all net you bonuses which are coupled with your combo meter. Additionally you have access to a concentration meter (aka bullet time) and also a cheat death meter allowing you to dodge a life-threatening bullet. This arcade style action is not revolutionary but is incredibly fun.\n\nThe story mode also contains duels which are a point of contention for many players. Thematically they almost seem necessary but mechanically they can be a bit of a nightmare, especially if you intend on winning your duels honourably. You have a focus and arm speed percentage which you want as high as possible before you draw but even with high numbers it can end up being a gamble as to whether you get a decent shot off first. The duels later in the game can be quite infuriating as the target moves around or simply draws with very little delay or room for error.\n\nJust a fantastic game from start to finish, with a new game plus mode to offer even more details to the mysterious story. Personal gripes lie with the last level being obnoxious as you're assaulted on all sides, the rifle build/path not being the best and losing save data related to the alternate modes. Otherwise I cannot recommend this game enough, on sale or not.","November 5, 2014","true","6.9"," 40 of 41 people (98%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","98","40","41","2","0"

Once Upon a Time in the West, The Man with No Name Trilogy, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, Tombstone, The Wild Bunch, True Grit, 3:10 to Yuma, etc. To me, when it comes to a good Western, I'm not too concerned about the tone or style. I'll enjoy 2+ hours of a Western without a single gunshot just as much one where everyone is getting put down like old yeller.\n\nHowever when it comes to videogames, I want a lot of action. For the longest time Sunset Riders was the only Western game I enjoyed. I guess I never had the patience for titles like Red Dead Redemption* and...uh...okay well there haven't been a lot of Western games period. I never realized just how barren the genre really was until now. It's really quite strange because with a little imagination, you can do anything with a Western-themed videogame.\n\nSo let's look at Gunslinger. As the story goes, Silas Greaves is a man seeking vengeance. In his search for his brother's murderers he encounters many of the legends of the West. Billy the Kid, Jesse James, Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid, you get the idea. This can't be just mere coincidence...can it? The storyline is unreliably narrated, with storyline changes affecting progress of the game. Expect to run into situations where you go one way, but then Silas is all "Wait. That's not how it went." and suddenly you're going somewhere else. All told it's very effective and adds a lot to what is a traditional Western storyline.\n\nSpeaking of traditional, this game is an arcade shootemup. There are some rare moments of quiet reflection, but you never spend more than a few seconds, not shooting cowboys in the face. The game is divided into several short stages. You run through the various environs, outlaws accost you, you gun them down. Each stage usually ends in a boss-fight. Some of these fights are straight out of Sunset Riders, just in FPS fashion. You've got the guy with the big health meter, he's firing on you from an advantageous position with the assistance of other thugs, oh if only they dropped a memorable one-liner when you dropped them (Bury me with my money...). Stages can also end the old-fashioned way, with a stand-off. In these duels you have to center your sight and steady your hand on your gun. Only the fastest and most accurate draw lives to tell the tale. These are pretty neat, though in the main game there isn't much to set one duel apart from the other. As you progress the outlaws become faster on the draw and move around more to throw off your focus at least.\n\nFor the most part, Gunslinger is pretty much a shooting gallery. Surviving dozens of armed bandits is one thing, but killing them stylishly for larger XP bonuses is what it's really all about. The trickier the shot, the more points you receive. Not everyone can ricochet a bullet through a wooden post and into a man's skull in the blink of an eye, but for those that can, it's worth a bunch of points. Trickier shots also reward the player with more concentration. Yes, this is obviously a mechanic with its own gauge at the corner of the screen. Concentration is basically the "slow down..pardner" button. Aside from causing everyone to move at the speed of snail, other benefits such as increased-damage are applied. XP is used to unlock various skills. While they're tied to certain weapons (pistols, rifles, or shotguns) the bonuses are univerally applied.\n\nThe first play-through is probably going to take five hours or less. As I said, Gunslinger doesn't fuss around with the details. Multiple difficulties are available, including a bonus "True West" setting. Not only does Silas die a bit easier, he also doesn't get all those helpful UI elements. Even something as simple as a crosshair is straight-up gone. At this point it is definitely to your benefit to take advantage of the New Game + so all of your acculumated skills carry over.\n\nThere are two additional modes in Gunslinger. Arcade mode dumps all of the plot, throws in more bad-guys, and changes the skill system. Instead of three sets of skills, you get three classes each with their own set. Getting the high scores practically require that you chain the entire stage. That means knowing where every outlaw is going to appear, reloading at the right moments, and using concentration when absolutely necessary. This mode definitely lives up to its name. It's frenetic and prone to chaos at first, but players will eventually become skilled enough to clear entire levels without wasting a shot. Duel mode is shockingly all about the duels. There are 15 stages and you have a limited number of lives to work with. If you enjoy the duels in the main game, that's plenty reason to consider giving this mode a run-through.\n\nReally though, what I enjoy the most about this game is all the shooting. Actually this game graduates to the level of shootin' game. Gunslinger is at it's best when you're rushing through stages capping everyone with trick shots and looking golden. Unfortunately there isn't the Western equivalent of a "360 no-scope". Still it's one of those shooters that knows how to make a player feel good about killin'. Also I like how there are bonus points for "last-breath" kills. One thing I hate about these checkpoint-based shooters is that they feel the need to obscure the player's vision when they're about to die. Look, it's a videogame, when I'm close to death I want to be able to see everything, not be handicapped. At least Gunslinger gets it right by giving a bonus for shootin' someone while half-blind.\n\nWith good story-telling and even better action, Call of Juarez (registered trademark) Gunslinger is definitely worth a look.\n\n*It could be I'm just sour because there's never been a PC port. I really didn't spend much time with RDR on my X360 or PS3.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","October 3, 2014","true","6.4"," 28 of 30 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","28","30","0","1"

Not that I heard great things about it...\nThe two other predecessors, however, I have played and finished.\n\nThe first thing I would say, if you are a fan of the series, is to divert your expectations. The first two games both were stories that attempted to, and perhaps succeeded, into gripping you into their narrative. A heart clenching story of vengeance and/or a lust for a haunted treasure.\n\nIn comparison, Gunslinger's story seems like a mini version of it. A simple adventure about and narrated by Silas Greaves, spoken in the context of a Saloon like he was a Cowboy telling a tall tale.\n\nThe interesting thing done here is how the story impacts the game, whereas it's usually vice versa. Your audience at several points takes over the narration for a moment, telling how they heard an event in question went down.\nAnd you play it all out, in a non-forced manner, taking their narrated path through the level. Eventually Silas will cut back in and tell how it really happened, winding back time to let the player cross through the level that way.\nIt's a very impressive, if not unique way of telling a story in a game.\n\nThe story itself, due to this, often comes across as a bit light heartened. It feels like it's lacking that darkness, that grit. But let me tell you, it eventually does come around, as Silas tells the story of his life as a Bounty Hunter in his quest for Revenge, and how he got around on starting in that line of work.\n\nThe array of guns may also seem simplified. A total of seven firearms and dynamite as throwables. It seems like that's not much, but for a story of this length, it seems enough. By the time you've gotten well comfortable and skilled, you'll have levelled up plenty and gotten around to a nice build to complement your weapon of choice.\n\nTalking of Levelling, the game makes use of three skilltrees. They mainly befit the Archetypes of Gunslinger, Ranger and Trapper. Which simply means Pistols, Long Range and Shotgun/Dyanimite. Each skilltree awards you with a stat boost and pretty skin of a specific weapon halfway and at the end of the skilltree. Each tree has at least two unique skills that make you an even deadlier man, and the weaker skills tend to have some synergy going with other skills. Again, it's not very extensive, but enough for a game of this length.\n\nCombat wise, it feels pretty good. The guns have weight to them, and fatal hits feel very satisfying. You have regenerating health, but so does the enemy apparently. You can fire two bullets in their chest, but if they find cover, those bullets can be considered wasted.\n\nI played this game on Hard, which especially urged me to make good use of cover. The enemy will not relent, and is quite intelligent compared to some titles. They take cover the moment you are spotted, move to another one if their current one proves not good enough, and they seemingy try to outflank you when they have the numbers. I was kept on my toes quite a bit, and every enemy felt like they could end me very quickly if I didn't pay attention.\n\nOverall, Gunslinger feels like a smaller (not necessarily stripped-down) version of the first game and Bound in Blood. But those were also full titiles, while at the time of writing this game is sold for 15.\nSo all in all, I would say that, with rational expectations, you'd very well get your money's worth.\n\nCall of Juarez: Gunslinger seems like a pet project treated with the love and magic of a Call of Juarez story, but smaller. If a typical CoJ story you are after, you might have a good time with this 7 hour game.","October 2, 2014","true","9.1"," 26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","26","31","0","0"

When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.” and in the world of Call of Juarez Gunslinger, it seems that a number of legends have been printed concerning Silas Greaves. Stumbling into a saloon in Abilene, Kansas, Greaves has a seat and the local patrons buy him drinks and as old men are wont to do, Silas begins recounting his life story in an attempt to set a few things strait that newspapers and dime novels has misrepresented.\n\nSilas' tale is, as one would expect, a tale of revenge. He is riding in hot pursuit of Roscoe “Bob” Bryant, Johnny Ringo, and Jim Reed who managed to kill his brothers and nearly kill him as well. His quest for vengeance brings him toe to toe with the likes of Billy the Kid, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, the Clantons and John Wesley Hardin making Silas the Forrest Gump of the old west. His stories seem more unlikely than what the papers and dime store novels have written about him and it isn't long before the patrons of the saloon view his yarn as an apologue rather than an autobiography. It doesn't help that the old timer's memory isn't what it used to be and some details are amended in the middle of his narration. On the gameplay end, this means that your environment can change around you during the course of a missions to account for Silas' faulty memory. While these add to the game's style, they do little to affect the firefights.\n\nGunslinger is a competent albeit uncomplicated shooter. Enemies appear en masse and are quick to huddle behind cover. A few special enemy types are present such as enemies with wooden shields, armored shotgun toting maniacs as well as the odd desperado behind a Gatling gun. In order to more efficiently blow gaping holes in the opposition, Silas can enter a concentration mode that slows time and highlights enemies in red. This can of course be replenished by slaying foes. An arcade style combo counter multiplies the points gained from cutting down outlaws and delivering head shots, shooting through cover or taking out men on the run earns bonus points. These points grant Silas experience which can be used to level up one of three skill trees. Only a handful of abilities in each of the trees feel like substantial upgrades however and the special weapons you unlock from each tree are more ornate versions of the standard weapons with a few stat tweaks meaning they don't really feel like new weapons. Never the less, Gunslinger manages to satisfy when you are wielding two six shooters and sending torrents of  blood flying from the skulls of those who would come between you and your prey.\n\nAlmost every level in Gunslinger's campaign concludes with a duel or boss encounter. The boss encounters often require gaining ground on an enemy posted behind a Gatling gun or having a shoot out with a single shotgun wielding bullet sponge. Duels are a bit more involved as you target an enemy to gain greater focus and position your hands for greater speed so that when the time comes your iron clears it's holster and your lead decimates the body of your opposition before he can even consider killing you. Duels require some quick timing and a bit of finesse to ensure that your focus is as high as it can be and your handspeed is maxed but ultimately these become a bit repetitive.\n\nPart of what makes Gunslinger so satisfying despite it's simple mechanics is that it drips with style. The notorious outlaws that you cross paths with are introduced through comic book panels and a beautifully detailed Boderlands style cel shaded graphical style prevents these comic panels from looking out of place. The dialogue is pulpy and seems ripped strait from a trashy dime store novel and while it can sometimes be a bit overwrought or contrived the overall aesthetic of the game makes it seem like an intentionally kitschy touch. Voice work is solid and the music plays on common western themes, employing distorted guitars to give the music a coarse tone that prevents it from conjuring quixotic images of  the west associated with 1950's western cinema culminating in a functional though not exactly exceptional soundscape.\n\nRounding out Gunslinger's feature set is an arcade mode that recycles sections of the singleplayer game and challenges players to string together combos and set high scores that can be compared with friends and the rest of the world on a leader board. A duel mode allows you to experience the game's duels back to back with a few added opponents. Neither of these modes will hold your attention since they do little to differentiate themselves from the game's campaign. The campaign itself will take around six hours and does have two endings. A new game plus mode and collectables add further incentive to play through the game once more.\n\nGunslinger is a stylish homage to the West. Fans of western cinema will find a number of references allusions to popular films and coming across some of the real outlaws whose exploits built the mythos of the West adds some novel appeal to the experience. Gunslinger masks the corners it cuts as a budget title with a rich style making it's campaign a mostly pleasant experience with repetition and simply enemy behaviors standing out as the only major blemishes. The West is somewhat of an untapped resource for video games and it's a shame that so few games have taken advantage of this period of American history. Let's hope that this new budget price point draws a few more people toward the Call of Juarez franchise and spurs the development of more satisfying western pulp.\n\n+Super Stylish\n+Budget Price\n+Simple, Solid Gameplay\n+Integration of historical figures\n\n-Repetitive\n-Bland AI\n-Additional Modes do not satisfy\n-Many upgrades don't feel like they have an impact","January 9, 2014","true","14.3"," 37 of 50 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","37","50","0","2"

Solid gunplay and nice mechanics that make it a bit more interesting, like some sort of 'focus' mode that let's you highlight and shoot the ever loving f*ck out of baddies.\n\nThe storytelling is definitely the strongest point of this game, you go along Silas' stories and meet interesting characters (that existed in the ACTUAL wild west) along the way. It's a very linear experience though, with little to no exploration or sidemissions in the storymode, sure there are the extra challenges that you can access in the main menu but those will give you 6 hours of extra playtime at most (or like 25 hours if you're a perfectionist like me).\nI did like the inclusion of "New Game Plus" which let's you keep all your upgrades while starting a new storymode, which still made it worth replaying once or twice.\n\nThat brings me to another weakness of this game: you can play through the entire storymode in about 3 hours, so while it's a fun game to knock out in one sitting (believe me, I just did, for the 3rd time) It doesn't hold much replay value other than bragging rights for completing the game on all difficulties, which even at the highest difficulty level, isn't all that hard.\n\nWhile it's a short and linear experience you find yourself shooting and blasting through, it does look pretty, with cell-shaded graphics giving it a borderlands-ish feeling which I definitely liked, you can even make your guns look prettier by upgrading your skills and you'll end up with beautifully engraved and gold-plated machines of DEATH!\n\n\nTL;DR\n+Good graphics\n+Good upgrade system (that let's you have nice and shiny weapons in the end)\n+Great gunplay\n+Interesting storyline\n+Outstanding presentation of said storyline\n+Interesting characters\n+NO UPLAY\n\n-Quite linear\n-Not a lot of replay value\n-Really short (you can knock this game out in 3 hours or so)\n-Not difficult, even on the highest difficulty setting\n\nVerdict: Call of Juarez Gunslinger is a fun game, that is fun to play if you're looking for an easy, quick game to play, it's not gonna challenge you, test your abilities to the maximum but it's definitely a fun story-driven experience, no matter how short that is.\n\n[7/10]","October 21, 2015","true","34.0"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","0"

The story is a bit on the short side but it is also a budget title and there are extra modes to play beyond the story.

So Dad walked into a bar back in 1910 and forced a bunch of people to listen to the story about that one time he killed all those guys, and then the other story where he killed those other bunch of guys, and then again, only someplace else. All in all he kills a lot of dudes.\n\nCall of Jose: Gunfighter takes place during the wild west, a time when it was okay to wear ponchos and not look like you're about to breast feed your kid. The game takes you to many locations like the United States of America, the United States of America, Mexico (I think), the United States of America, and my backyard. At each of these locations you kill a bunch of dudes with old timey guns such as a revolver, another revolver, a rifle, a shotgun, and another revolver.\n\nThis would be really bad if it didn't feel so good to shoot people in this game. Please don't tell my therapist I said that.\n\nFor an obviously budgeted game, Call of Amigo: Slapbattler has a lot going for it in the shooting guys department. Although you only have a basic assortment of weapons, each one of them has this nice crunch to them when you fire. It also helps that you get points that pop up on the screen that are saying “Hurray! You killed a guy!” like some sort of Spaghetti Western version of the Running Man.\n\nThe levels in Call of Django: Tarantino are fairly linear, and you can tell that the team was constrained by a budget by the used assets you run into, but you kind of look past that stuff just by how the story is told. Through the entire game, Dad tells the story from a first person perspective, even going as far as to voice the other characters like he is telling a story, there are other characters that talk, but unless they're people who are listening to his story they're either just enemy chatter or few and far between.\n\nThere is also a dueling feature because killing everyone someone has ever known or loved isn't enough, you have to beat him in a fair fight as well just to show him who's the boss of this gym. You use the movement keys to move your hand closer to your gun and aim at the person you're about to plug with the mouse. These two fill up a meter that will let you draw your gun faster when it comes time to draw as well as hit the stupid ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on the other side with one quick bullet, like Leonardo DiCaprio in that one movie he was in. You know. The one where he dies.\n\nBut the problem with Call of Chihuahua: Taco Bell is that it's short, you can beat it in a single sitting even with potty breaks. This is alleviated a bit with some replay value such as new game plus and arcade mode where the who racking up points via murder plays a much bigger role. But that can only take you so far.\n\nShould you play: Call of Tequila: Sombrero?\n\nI like it, but that's where it kind of stops. It's not amazing, but it's not mediocre or awful either. It's a fun romp through the old west with a good narrator and back story. The shooting is good for what it is and it doesn't really get boring or grate on you. The few boss characters or heavy characters that they're are aren't complete bummers to fight either and even bullet sponges can go down with one well placed bullet. I would say get it on sale and just blast through it in one sitting.\n\nCall of Jaurez: Old guy gets 7 Dirty Harry references out of 10.\n\nWait, Dirty Harry wasn't a western.\n\n\nHere's a curator where you probably won't get shot in: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curation","March 1","true","6.4"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","83","20","24","14","0"

First off I loved the approach the developers took to the game.  Now if you have read my other reviews you will know I'm not a huge fan of first person shooters.  I am however a gamer!!  So the game play is secondary to this larger-than-life storytelling.  So you take on the role of Silas Greaves legendary bounty hunter.  The best way I can think to describe the game it your character Silas is telling about his legendary life in a true old west fashion.  Its a first person shooter  told by yourself in a third person storytelling style.  You are Silas Greaves walking into a saloon taking advantage of your bounty hunter status and storytelling ability for some free booze.  Are they all big fish story's or true?  At a certain point I was thinking the gameplay got in the way of the story.  That is how good it is being told.  But the game play is basic nothing expectational or revolutionary as far as a video game goes.  The duels are probably the best part.  They automatic checkpoints will save you from time to time lot of blood shed by Silas as his career as a bounty hunter so dying in the game is expected from time to time.  They fast pace of the game is key to survival in my opinion if you take a more reserved approach you will not die as much but miss out on the point of the story because the narrative is bigger then life he didn't stop to cover he went balls to the wall in wild wild west style.  But with its lackluster play style they story makes up for it in a tremendously enormous way.  Once I started playing I want to see the next chapter from beginning to end.  Also this is the fourth installment of Call of Juarez I haven't played the others but I will be looking into them because if the main antagonist in those is anything like Silas  and the way they tell story is similar they will be just as fun I would assume.  But definitely worth the price steam has on it $14.99 and if its on sale its a MUST BUY.","September 24, 2014","true","14.0"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

The graphics are unique in that they are different from your average FPS, I'd kind of liken them to Borderlands, but even prettier in my honest opinion. The thing that shines most in this game is the replay value, with a great story mode and arcade mode you could play through the story multiple times, (thanks to a simple yet enjoyable leveling and perk system) and have a different experience every time. The gun play is amazing, fast paced, visceral, and adrenaline incuding. Once you've gotten the hang of things and you're popping heads left and right you will almost feel like a badass bounty hunter yourself.

After having played it myself, I can safely say that it is a fantastic game and one I've never played anything quite like before.\n\nYou play as Silas Greaves, playing through stories of past exploits in the wild west as they are being told by yourself in the present.  This is one of the game's greatest strengths, as the storytelling not only perfectly matches the action, but will also change the environment and even make you replay parts of the story in different ways as various people tell how they've heard the story before.  It may not sound like the best idea, but it plays excellently and I'd love to see more games done in this style.\n\nThe other big strength of the game is the gameplay itself.  It does arcade shooting action very well and also includes the ability to avoid death by dodging bullets and slow time down with concentration mode.  You gain experience for killing enemies with a combo multiplier increasing the value of each kill and can use this experience to gain new skills.  Outside of the regular gameplay there is also a rather unique dueling feature.  You will be pitted against a famous outlaw in a wild west duel where you must keep your concentration by keeping a reticule on your enemy while keeping your hand ready to draw.  It provides an excellent sense of suspense before shots are fired and tests your reaction time very well.\n\nGraphically the game looks pretty good with a pseudo-comic style lightly outlining objects in the game.  Don't expect groundbreaking graphics, however.  Sound effects are also quite good and fit the game very well.\n\nOn the technical side is the only part of the game I'm disappointed in.  Call of Juarez Gunslinger runs on the Chrome engine so like all other Chrome engine games I have played it won't run quite smoothly.  It likes to drop frames randomly though it will run quite fast.  The game does not respond well to ALT+TAB and will get a visible mouse cursor fairly often when using the Steam overlay.  FOV can be changed through a config file as with other Chrome engine games.\n\nBuy this game, you won't regret it!","October 19, 2014","true","13.4"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","2"

Colorful graphics, arcade like score system, level ups, story,...\n\nI was right - this game makes everything right.\n\nYou are an old guy, who can't remember exactly what happened a few years ago, but that does not prevent you to tell your story to every stranger in the bar, you are currently in and drinking whisky. So it was not hard to recognise myself with the narrator.\n\nSo you are telling your weird story and during the good old rusty voice is sounding, you are playing the game and watching how the world is changing: some new ways will be built, some cherokees will turn into bandits in no-time and so on. It's a very dynamic game.\n\nThere is not only the story mode, which will take around four hours to complete. You also are able to face off famous western outlaws like Billy the Kid, Jessy James, The Dalton Brothers and many others in the duel mode. 1 vs 1, only pistols, who will be faster?\n\nArcade mode is also very nice, but maybe not that motivating. It's kind of a score attack in already visited level passages.\n\nWhat I really like is the New game + mode. Where you are able to complete your skill trees and find the last hidden golden nuggets.

I just loved the western feel, and I also loved the second one :)\nbut... after the cartel... I was afraid they lost it, until I saw this game! and I knew they're back!\n\nStory\nThe story is about this old bounty hunter named Silas Greaves, it all begins when Silas enters a Saloon and starts telling his story...\nSilas's story is how he met\dueled\killed real outlaws from the Wild West, outlaws like Billy The Kid, Jesse James and more... all in the sake of revenge...\n\nGraphics\nI loved the graphics, it's not BF4 or Metro, it's more like Borderlands 2, they tried to make it like a cartoon, since the whole game is being told by Silas,\nThe cut scenes are like comic book pages, anyways, the game got really sweet graphics, for me, it worked!\n\nGameplay\nGunslinger is a FPS with touches of RPG, set in the Wild West, so you know what you'll get... and they deliver it!\nThe game is packed with gun fights, where you run in the old wild west towns, deserts, moving trains, mountains, mines and more,\nthe RPG part is that you have 3 trees that you can choose from, Desperado, Trapper and Ranger, The Desperado class focuses on two revolvers, Ranger uses his Lever-Action rifle and the trapper uses Shotgun and dynamites,\neach level you get a point you can spend to each class, after 6 skill points invested in each class you get a legendary weapon, which is just a better revolver\shotgun\rifle\neach chapter you face a boss which is an historical figure as i said above, for instance, in the first mission you face off Pat Garret,\nwhen you face those bosses, you enter a duel, which is pretty cool too, they've made it really nice!\nthey also have a bullet-time effect, where you gain concentration after killing your enemies just like the old Call Of Juarez games.\nOk, so I'll just summarize this, the gameplay is just great! i mean, the shootouts are great, it's full of action, and if you love the wild west like i do, this is the game for you!\n\nConclusion\nI hope they'll make more like this!\nThe game is just amazing, well made, bug-free, full of action and fun, they deliver the atmosphere of the wild west, from the narration to the scenery and to the guns and foes.\nthe game is pretty short actually, about 10 chapters, and it took me about 7 hours to finish it, but hey, it's 15$ so for that price is a steal imo,\nthere is also an arcade mode that you can play which has 10 levels, the arcade mode is another game that you need to make combos to reach high score and compete with friends.\nSo, after they made the Cartel game and failed big time, they redeemed them self with this great game imo, I can't wait for them to make more games like this!\nand if you didn't play this one yet, but it now! and play it now!\n\nSome screens:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=191646679\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=190821536\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=190821484\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=190674908\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=190674923\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/JustLynx/screenshots/?appid=204450&sort=newestfirst&browsefilter=myfiles&view=imagewall","November 5, 2013","true","9.9"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jbaketkd/recommended/204450/","jbaketkd","Vash(88)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jbaketkd/","787 products in account","Call of Juarez is an extremely linear shooter; although, it does hold  a solid amount of entertainment.  The game-play isn't anything new apart from the duels, but the story and voice acting are both top of the line.  The player gets to meet and kill many of the legendary outlaws of wild west, and the way the game-play follows the dialog of the main character can be both fresh and, unfortunately, annoying at times.\n\nThe shooting always comes down to the same thing: the player picks his or her semi automatic western influenced weapon of choice, then proceeds to blast heads off of cowboys, outlaws and different Indian tribes while following a set path until the duel at the end of the chapter is reached.  The game-play falls short after a short while due to how easy the game is.  The player is given a slow-mo ability, but the game is a push over even without it.  The fault comes from the lack of aggression in the AI.  The bad guys simply stay in the same spot or run back and forth from one of 2 cover points until the player kills them.  Only a select few enemies will actually advance on the player's position.  Granted, the duels that at the end of most chapters can be a lot of fun and a good challenge.  Each one feels a little different from the last, and getting the hang of the dueling controls can take some time to master.\n\nThe story is told by the main character as the player progresses, and the ending has a nice and unexpected twist.  Something that was not expected from Techland after giving such a bland and unexciting end to Dead Island.\n\nThe weapons all feel and sound great, and there was a lot of effort put into the detail; however, there is a lack of options given that the pistols all feel alike -- the same goes for the rifles and shotguns.  There were some nice touches, though.  For instance, when shooting a double barrel shotgun, each of the hammers have a separate animation and work independently from each other.\n\nIf you are looking for five or 6 chill hours of western shooting, this is a fun game.  If you are looking for a shooter that is going to keep you on your toes and thinking outside of the box, avoid this game at all costs.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=319632478","September 27, 2014","true","7.6"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/204450/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","There has never been a game that has surpassed my adoration for the original wild wild west game Red Dead Revolver. From it's unique game play style to it's duels. I have to admit though, if I were to choose one game from the present that was near it's greatness, it would be Call of Juarez : Gunslinger.\n\nNow, the story sort of took me by surprise. I was expecting the typical scenematic every now and again between shootouts. This wasn't the case. CoJ : G approaches the story by telling it from a man named Silas's perspective. I felt like a kid in elementary again being read a book as I sat quietly listening on the mat floor. The cut-scenes aren't fully animated, but are animated enough to give you a rough idea of what everyone looks like. Within the game, Silas's voice narrates the action while his friends will sometimes pipe in with a question or a comment. The game is definitely unique in it's approach to telling a story.\n\nI was extremely skeptical before I even tried out the game. I've heard a few positive reviews but haven't seen anything to make it substantially stick out. I gave it a shot and am glad. The game play will keep you immersed, but depending on how much you like what they give you, depends how long it will suck you in for. I haven't been bored yet as they do a good mix of allowing you to use all of your weapons (or explosives) at a given time. There are times where the game play will stop and the player will have to have a duel with an enemy. This brought me back to the good old days of Red Dead. Instead of simply copying former versions that have included dueling, CoJ rather has you and the opponent sort of circling one another. At this point, the player tries to focus in on the opponent (with one joystick) and adjusts their hand position over the gun with the other joystick. Carefully watching the opponent, once he draws then you can draw. Draw first and lose honor. The game play itself is done in first person and the guns move relatively to where you move, meaning if there is a wall in the way of one revolver, Silas will hold the left revolver up (for example) while the right one can engage enemies.\n\nThe guns themselves are sort of basic but slowly upgrade throughout the game. Basic guns include revolvers (you can have dual-lies), rifle, sawed-off shotgun, and the double barreled shot gun. Explosives are also available such as sticks of dynamite. Within the map, there are explosive objects which can be shot to damage opponents within the proximity. There is also a feature which slows down the game and gives the player a chance to take out as many opponents as they can before their "focus" stamina runs out. When a player's health runs low, you're given a final chance to redeem yourself and get back on your feet. This happens by focusing in on one opponent (automatically) and he fires a single bullet at you. If you dodge the bullet, you can keep the mayhem going. If you get hit, you're sleeping with the fishes. I absolutely love this portion of the game as it keeps you on your toes and engaged within the game play almost at all times. Just because that dynamite is flying in the air doesn't mean it has to explode by you. Shoot it before it gets near you! The RPG element of the game deals with improving your skill with the revolvers, rifle, or shotgun. Choose wisely as you may favor a gun more than the others.\n\nThe graphics in the game are unique to their own sense. Their good but follow a cartoon sort of look in the slightest bit. Sounds are good and when a gun shot lands, you can definitely feel and hear it. I absolutely love what they did with the HUD. The more you get shot, the blurrier your screen becomes with bullet holes on it.\n\nI like this game, but I do feel they could have done a little bit more with it. I'm certain adding a multiplayer option would fill the void and add some more depth, but I would have liked to see what more they could have done to add to the game. The FPS experience is definitely a notable one. I've talked mostly positive, but once the game's done, there isn't much else to see.\n\nRating : 7.45/10\n\nGameplay	B+	Story / Campaign	B+	Visuals / User Interface	B	Sounds / Music	B-	Replay-ability	C-	Overall 	B-\n\nWould have been a 7.5+ easily with some replay-ability. Not typically a bad asking price though - quite fair.\n\nScreenShots :\nWhat getting shot looks like\n\nJust as I'm about to die, I get a second chance at life if I do this right (check following screenshot)\n\nDodge right or left\n\nWhat a duel looks like\n\nQuick time events being snuck into the game between shootouts\n\nIn a few years, everyone will copy his style\n\nI like games that try at every point to keep the player engaged.","September 1, 2015","true","5.2"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

I certainly didn't expect much of a game called "Call of Juarez: Gunslinger", or at least not more than a mindelss little trash fest. Actually the only reason I bought this game was because Chris Fanklin said some things about the story telling that sounded interesting - and the game was on sale.\n\nBut now that I've finished the game over the last two days I can barely remember the last time I had that much fun with a game. The action is fast and there's enough variety to keep the interest even for someone like me, who usually doesn't like shooters. I played the game with an Xbox controller and it worked fine (even if it wasn't the most easy game for me).\n\nBut that's by far not everything. The game's beautiful and it knows that, giving players some rest from time to time to enjoy the view as the sunlight shines through the trees. Even if the game is rather short, it ends it's story in a very satisfying way.\n\nYou barely see a game that in manages to intertwine storytelling and gameplay mechanics in a way that both complement each other. Gunslinger does it with an easy that not only impressed me but could also be a textbook example for the whole ego shooter genre, that seems to be stuck in the same tropes since Half-Life was released over a decade ago.\n\nI didn't expect much from Gunslinger and got a game that impressed me with it's perfect execution of a well thought out idea. It might not be as ambitious as Bioshock Infinite, but it's certainly a better game in any regard.","October 5, 2014","true","12.2"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","0"

This game mixes high-octane arcade wild-west gun action with narrative trick and focus of Bastion... AND IT WORKS!\n\nCore gameplay is really satisfing. Nice controls, awesome gun mechanics, bullet time. Everything works here pretty well. The story is most interesting part of this game however. You are basically playing through recollections of old bounty hunter that tells his story in the Sallon. Your hero regularly tends to leave some plot holes along the way or he misrepresents some historical facts and everything is translated into gameplay in pretty clever way. This idea is a meat of the game for me and I'm really impressed.\n\nSidemissions are also suprisingly awesome. Found collectibles give you some historical factoids about people, event or places of the real Wild West and those are really interesting reads, especially when you contrast them with main protagonist's story. Arcade mode is tons of fun and Dueling "At the High Noon" mechanics, while not completely clear for the player at the beginning, make for really fun boss fights with many famous outlaws of USA's 19th and 20th century history.\n\nI can easily ignore most of the nitpicks. This game isn't sharp in every aspect (regular bossfights and some of the story elements come to mind). But for the asking price, this game is great.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drpixel/recommended/204450/","drpixel","DrPixel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drpixel/","3726 products in account","Having never played the prior Call of Juarez games, and hearing that this new one was pretty good after the supposedly terrible Cartel, I wasn't really too fond on getting it. I'm not a huge fan of old western movies, or games like Red Dead Redemption on consoles, though I do enjoy them. I like arcade shooters though, and when a friend gave me it I just had to try it.\n\nThe game starts with the player, an aging bounty hunter of years past named Silas Greaves, entering a saloon in a stylized comic-book/hand drawn sort of cutscene. He orders a drink (or two....or three), and begins to tell his story to the other people in the saloon, who seem fascinated by his presence. He tells wild tales of his past, each one being a level in the game, and entertains the people listening in with his crazy adventures. He narrates the story while you play through his supposed (I'll get to that in a bit) adventures, and the other people listening in chime in sometimes too.\n\nNow, Silas is a big fat liar as it seems he's everywhere at once. First he's with the famous Billy the Kid, then next he's dueling with Jesse James, the famous bandit. Is any of what he says true? No, not at all, and the other people start to suspect him as the game goes on and it gets pretty funny. In fact, the whole game is pretty humorous as Silas is a drunken liar so he changes the story or ridiculously adds in things akin to "breaking the fourth wall" moments. He does some really silly things too and seems to always be present at every major event in southwestern USA folklore.\n\nAs I said earlier, levels consist of playing through Silas's supposed "past stories", each of which are pretty fun and fast-paced. Sometimes Silas will cause certain things to happen based on his blatant bluffing or his audience will call him out and he'll rewind to tell the story like it "really is". Gameplay consists of you moving from point to point, shooting enemies for points, and moving more. That's essentially all that the game is, but it doesn't waste its time and constantly delivers either funny scenes or action-packed scenes. I like that a lot, and it's probably what kept me going to beat it in one sitting. That may sound pretty crazy, but the game is only about 5 hours long so it's not too bad and the game kept me engaged.\n\nI usually have a lot of problems with shooters, but this one was very solid with collectables (that included real facts of southwestern lore, which was neat to see being of the southwest myself!) littered all over the place and points to gather from killing enemies. In addition, there was also some very light RPG mechanics that were nice to see. I only wish that there were more weapons and more ways to gain points.\n\nGraphically speaking, this is quite the good looking game and it runs very well on even slightly older machines like mine. I was surprised to see it look so good AND run so well! Textures are crisp and the animations are fairly smooth. This is essentially a AAA arcade game so you can expect it to look as good as the name backing it is popular (Ubisoft).\n\nI can't really recall the sound or music being anything superb, but the voice acting is great and certain songs were particularly pleasant on the ears (one of the credits songs comes to mind). Everything just gives off a lovely southwestern sort of feel that you very rarely see in games nowadays.\n\nCall of Juarez: Gunslinger overall just felt "good" to me. Nothing really stood out, but I enjoyed it a lot and would probably recommend it to others if they like shooters. However, I would not give it a huge recommendation or say it's one of the best 2013 games, no, it's not really deserving of that high in my opinion. The humor is decent and the action will keep you entertained, but even if it's one of the best Call of Juarez games it won't win any awards I think.\n\nI give this game a: 7/10","January 11, 2014","true","6.6"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dons20/recommended/204450/","dons20","TRU±PlayMaker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dons20/","569 products in account","IntroductionCall of Juarez: Gunslinger is a first-person shooter that combines tall tales of the wild west with a unique visual style in one of the most fun arcade-styled shooters of 2013. One of the strongest points of this game, is that it does not try to take itself too seriously, allowing for some unique plot twists, fun moments and interesting gameplay overall.\n\nI have not played the previous games in the series as of the time of writing this, so I will not be comparing this game to its predecessors. Instead I will be reviewing it based on its merits.\n\nStoryYou are Silas Greaves, a traveller who stumbles upon a bar in a certain town in the old west. You meet some local folks and begin telling them a few stories of your travels. As you re-live those journeys, Silas narrates all the action, and the game may somehwat change depending on what he is currently saying. This can lead to some pretty ridiculous moments where you can hardly believe what you're seeing, only to watch as the game changes to fit the new narrative. It really helps to emphasize the whole 'tall tale' aspect and let you see it in the eyes of the audience he is telling it to (or at least how he remembers it).\n\nGameplayStory Mode\nCall of Juarez: Gunslinger takes a more casual, 'arcadey' approach to the FPS genre. There are three playstyles which you can employ in the game. If you like taking enemies out from range, grab a rifle. Or do you prefer close-range combat? Grab a shotgun. Perhaps you like rapid mid-range fire, grab the dual pistols. This type of diversity makes the combat fun, and really caters to anyone's particular playstyle. Combined with these options, is the skill tree which really empowers the weapons you choose to specialize in. You aren't locked to any particular tree, allowing you to level any skill that suits your tastes at any time. I really like this option, as it encourages multiple playthroughs without preventing you from having a particular skill locked away because you decided to try something new. If you level up a particular skill tree enough, you unlock a special golden weapon that has special benefits over the standard version. This gives something special for players to work towards and motivated me enough to want to play the game repeatedly.\n\nCombos are a highlight of the game, turning this from a simple FPS to a more arcade-themed one, where players try their best to keep those multipliers up.\n\nYou'll often have hidden "Nuggets of Truth" which give you historical facts based on the particular story you're hearing. These are really useful for finding out what is fact and what is fiction in this wild rollercoaster of a story.\n\nDuels\nThese are fun but tense modes where you face off against another fellow gunslinger. This is a one-shot, one-kill mode where timing, accuracy and reaction times are of the utmost importance, and one mistake can leave you with a dishonorable rating, or even worse; dying.\n\nVisualsCall of Juarez: Gunslinger has an art style which is not often used for FPS games. With a style similar to the Borderlands series it gives a cartoony feeling but can have some of the most beautiful looking environments ever. Mountain levels were especially appealing, as the game had some stunning environments which would almost distract you from the gunfight you were currently engaged in. This game has has all the other aspects which makes it just as gruesome as many other well known titles. Headshots result in an almost artistic splash of blood, while bodily shots may not give the same effect. Guns look and feel powerful, especially the golden versions, and firing them is an absolute pleasure.\n\nAudioFollowing the aforementioned point, the sounds in this game are so crisp and clean, and really seal the 'immersion' in the game though of course, 'immersion' isn't the real selling point of the game. From the sound of bullets whizzing by your ear, to the loud boom of a shotgun blast, the audio was clearly well designed and deserves all the praise it could get. The voice actors were top-notch as well, giving you the feeling that you were listening to a real cowboy right through the story. I'm a sucker for good audio, so I was pleasantly surprised to find so many realistic sounds in this game to really sell it. Simply amazing.\n\nNegativesWhile the levels themselves were well designed with great checkpoints, and they were pretty large overall, we weren't really encouraged to explore, as the game was still very much linear, with its only merit being larger areas to explore. Some towns had very large areas to explore, but nothing to reward that exploration. It felt like a waste of time to even explore, so I just didn't bother for the most part.\n\nThere was no multiplayer unfortunately, which I think would have been pretty good if there was possibly, co-op, versus or something. Instead, it just turned out to be a single-player game (a very good one nonetheless).\n\nThere were a couple tiny bugs here and there but they really weren't very noticable, and a quick restart from checkpoint fixed any issues I had.\n\nSummary & ConclusionCall of Juarez: Gunslinger is a marvellous game which is a breath of fresh air among most FPS titles. The art style and arcade-type gameplay really sells the 'casual' aspect while the sounds, entertaining story, and skill-tree system give the player a lot more than they would expect.\n\nIt is definitely a great game and one that everyone should be willing to give a go at least once.\n\n9/10 Worth a buy.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

This game is a regular FPS shooter but with the addition of unique gun dueling combat system. After several gun duels, my body actually developed higher reflex and coordination and I can shoot better and faster in the game dueling combat. This made me really feel like a gunslinger living in the wild west. Unfortunately there is no multiplayer. The developer should add multiplayer if they ever release a sequel to this game. Story co-op would be fun and Player vs Player gun duel would be really awesome.\n\nThe story mode is too short though and the last chapter a little bit stalling, but overall still interesting. If they can expand this wild west franchise to a bigger game world like RDR and adding multiplayer, this game will be a winner.\n\nCONCLUSION :\nRecommended on full price, a must-have on sale price.","May 19","true","15.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

The art style is really detailed and suits the setting, the execution is tidy and really brings the wild west to life.  The story is quite engaging and had enough twists and turns, and a good dose of humour to keep you on board for one more level...\n\nDownsides are that this is kind of repetative, and you will find yourself shooting hundreds of dum dums not so much out of skill as out of need to progress to the next room full of dum dums standing there ready to get mowed down.  The lovely bullet time mechanic is good for racking up some sweet points, but completely undone by the bloody quick time events that seems to pop up the second you trigger the bullet time.  These quick time events are basically 50/50 going to kill you depending which way you dodge, oh and by the time thats sorted out your bullet time meter is empty, bad luck.\n\nAlso annoying is the duelling sub game.  You need to fill up your focus by hovering a ring over the person you are duelling, the longer you hold it steady the more time you get to shoot them when its go time.  Problem is the focus ring is swerving all over the road like a drunk teenage nanny dropping your kids off at the pool and so you need more luck than skill to fill up your focus.  You can draw when you like but you are going to be the bad guy if you do, so basically dont do it. Wait for them to draw on you and then its 50/50 again if you are going to die.\n\nThis for me is a game that almost was legendary, almost.  Not buggy, not poorly designed as such, just had some shortcomings and never really lived up to the hype of the reviews I read.  buy it cheap, play through once then uninstall and move on...\n\nUPDATE.  For any other r.e.t.a.r.d who thinks I'm not entitled to an opinion, and cant understand that just because I do not recommend this game, doesnt mean I didnt like it - nobody is forcing you to buy this game, nobody is forcing you to read this review. If you like the game more than i did write your own review and by all means give it a thumbs up, just dont think you get to come on my review and make ridiculous comments like youre so much better at games than someone youve never met just because they did not think this was the best game in the world.  It's not the best game in the world - cope with that, buy it or dont, not my problem.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aprofilehere/recommended/204450/","aprofilehere","Gunderson Mallard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aprofilehere/","2359 products in account","How the Old West was Lost\n\nAs Silas makes his way to the saloon, a car nearly runs him over, or so we are led to believe through the graphic novel cutscenes. Gunslinger is a blending of the old and the new, fact and fiction; Gunslinger tells a story about storytelling.\n\nSilas’ story is presented through the original tradition of storytelling: by word of mouth. As Silas tells his story the truth becomes blurred: he embellishes his story, challenge history, and is challenged by other patrons of the saloon and his own memory. All of these elements make a well-worn, classic story feel fresh again, and make for some interesting turns in the gameplay. At one point Silas mentions that some men attacked him and they were like Apaches, at which point Apaches surround the player as he fights for his life, but then Silas corrects the story by emphasizing that the men attacked like Apaches, but were in fact just the bandits mentioned earlier.\n\nThe gameplay synthesizes with the idea of blending old and new. The action of the game has a very distinct arcade feel. There are explosions everywhere, combo kills, frantic firefights, and cartoonish blood spurts. Coupled with this are the modern gun and health mechanics: carrying only one gun from each category of weapon, regenerating health over time, and three skill trees to invest in after level ups.\n\nThe slick art style and presentation fit perfectly with the game. Every character in the game is introduced with a small Sergio Leone inspired sequence. Add to the style is The duel mechanic that makes you feel like a cowboy: slowly inching your hand closer to your gun as your eyes focus on your target, and you have to draw second if you want to kill your opponent honorably.  Old West fans and history buffs will appreciate how crowded this game is with famous figures and “Nuggets of Truth” that detail some of the history that the game touches on.\n\nGunslinger shows just how good Westerns can be. Adding to the style, interesting storytelling, and great action is the replay value. You can try your hand at a various arcade levels, duels, and Silas Greaves may be old, but he still has a story tell and a good fight in him.","November 26, 2013","true","33.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

And one thing I can say after playing it through is it is essentially a flawless gem for me. The somewhat cell-shaded graphics still look good, the shooting is great and extremely satisfying and the setting is purely awesome. The game itself is entirely story-driven, but the story behind it is really interesting, it incorporates a lot of actual Wild West history as well as plenty of legends. There is enough humor for it to not become too serious and there is enough suspense to keep you interested in what is going on. Great music and absolutely awesome voice acting complete the experience. The collectible “nuggets of truth” are hidden quite cleverly and are not that easy to find and along with a “game plus” mode provide some replayability. On the other hand, the nuggest provide a very interesting insight into speculations about whether the Wild West legends (including people and events) are actually true or not. Other “additional” features include a series of duels (not that interesting for me) and replaying some of the game parts as “shootout” scenes, which are fairly satisfying. If you have ever had even a passing interest in Wild West, please, do yourself a favor and try the demo of this game. The game is EXACTLY like the demo and, if you like it, you will not be disappointed (a demo that actually represents a game well – how common that is nowadays?). I would strongly suggest that you buy this in a pack with Far Cry: Blood Dragon, which is another awesome shooter that I have reviewed last year. If your tastes are anything similar to mine, you will certainly not be disappointed.","July 1, 2015","true","20.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

The whole game is a straight-forward action shooter with the hilarious framing of being a story told by an old man of his younger days to a few people in a saloon in 1910, in order to get himself some free drinks.\n\nThe game is great fun and has a rather whimsical "Spaghetti Western" feel to it as you blast your way through and the storytelling works itself into the game. One minute you'll be running along happy as a clam blasting desperados, then suddenly he'll mention he's trapped and running low on ammo! And lo' and behold the way forward and your retreart are cut off as debris litterally fall from the sky to block your path and suddenly your ammo counter rapidly dwindles away of its own volition!\n\nThe guns are quite satisfying to handle, though I admit I typically stuck to a preferred loadout (the Ranger is the only pistol worth using, when I shoot a man, I expect him to die, and that pistol is the only one who does that job). Overall the game was certainly worth the purchase, and it has not just story mode (with new game+ for the uprades!) but a score attack mode of sorts too.\n\nAnyways, for the cost of a few beers, you can have ol' Silas Greaves spin ya a yarn or two. Most of its ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, I reckon, but damned all if it ain't entertainin'.","December 2, 2013","true","5.3"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Very cool feature, if you ask me. Way more worthwhile than just "items" you pick up for completion.\nI also want to mention the duels. They're detailed and difficult. You have to keep your eye on your target (a focus circle you use the mouse to guide) while positioning your hand over your gun for a quicker draw speed, and you also have to watch your target's hand to make sure he makes the first move (otherwise, your kill is deemed dishonorable), and react quickly enough to blow the other guy's head off first.\n\nOh, and bonus points because Silas actually blew smoke off his revolver. Fckyeah.\n\nI saw a lot of detailed positive reviews, so I'll keep mine short since I'm sure it's all been said before. I can't believe this game isn't more popular!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/albertrayon/recommended/204450/","albertrayon","albertrayon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/albertrayon/","1581 products in account","Call of Juarez Gunslinger is a Western themed First Person Shooter from Techland and published by Ubisoft. It is the fourth game in the Call of Juarez series, however experience in the previous games is not necessary to enjoy the gameplay and storyline. This is the first Call of Juarez game I have played, and I don't feel like I was missing out on anything by skipping the first few.\n\nThe gunplay in Call of Juarez Gunslinger is fast and hectic, but very enjoyable. The controls are tight, and even when the game throws an overwhelming amount of enemies at you, between the bullet time, three gun types and dynamite, you feel like you have all the tools you need to take down the entire Wild West. That's pretty much what you are doing here, with a body count approaching the thousands by the end of the game.\n\nThe ridiculous body count fits in with the story, however, because the plot is framed around a tale an oldtimer is telling to those gathered in a bar. Apparently Silas Greaves was responsible for taking down nearly every famous outlaw in the Old West, and you get to relive the story as he tells it. Within that framework comes some neat tricks, as you will replay sections of levels with slight differences as it is misremembered, and new paths will open up before you as they spring from memory. The whole story takes on the feel of a tall tale, which seems fitting for a game about the Old West, where legends and tall tales are aplenty.\n\nIn addition to the normal gunplay, there is a duel mode as you finally come face to face with each of your foes. It does an admirable job of adding the tension that duels must have built, as you must keep focus on your enemy while making sure your hand is ready to draw. If you enjoy the duels, which I did, there is a duel mode where you can face all your enemies again, with a leaderboard to track your score against friends.\n\nThe graphics and sound exude style. The characters are all very well designed, and the environments are very enjoyable. Cutscenes all have a storybook feel. The voice acting is stupendous, and often humorous as you listen to the audience argue with the storyteller. I was expecting something good in these departments, and what was delivered is great.\n\nOverall I completely recommend Call of Juarez Gunslinger. It will take about 5 hours to complete the main story mode, but the price point fits that length. This was a budget priced title, but many aspects of it feel AAA in quality. I had heard good things about this game, but it exceeded my expectations.\n\nGrade: A","January 15, 2015","true","9.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I've always hated game stories that are told in past-tense, but this game makes a great case for it's usage. Often, revisions, depictions, and plot details are inserted mid-game, changing the environment as the player traverses through them. The plot itself only really becomes interesting in the second half, but when it does, it's quite enthralling.\n\nThe gameplay itself feels like something common on the Chrome engine - the same engine that Far Cry 3 utilizes. There's a similar RPG progression, though it's dialed back for a much smaller game. Early game, it's not much fun, but as abilities are unlocked, the game feels much more fleshed out. It certainly makes the iron-sight-and-recharging-health gameplay easier to swallow.\n\nA better-than-average game with some pretty neat tricks up it's sleeves. I'd say that's worth picking up.","November 25, 2013","true","7.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Gameplay is simple, yet satisfying and funny, and here are examples why: ladder appeared after Greaves realised he went that way, or a body of an old indian fell out of the sky when he needed ammo. A cool, western comedy shooter, with a serious story, few well known weapons and setting you will not find anywhere else. Graphics are in this 3D drawing style which fits the game just perfectly as well as the cutscenes, which not only aren't annoying, but are short, nicely made and skipable. And the absolute GEM of ALL THE FPS is the hardest gamemode, which makes you feel like a real cowboy - no hud, no crosshair, no clues. Just you and your guns. This is how all the shooters should be made. You will become a master of FPS after completing this game on hardest mode. The good thing as well are duels, which train reaction time and focus.

All of the different mechanics to make you feel like a real gunslinger - dodging bullets in slow-motion, bullet time, ADS with a pair of revolvers, the duels, and the reflex QTEs. Everything just adds up.\n\nMy only real complaint is subjective, even. There just doesn't seem to be enough weapon variety, even if I am typically sticking to my revolvers and rifle. But that's okay. They work, and do they work well. The fact your weapons upgrade through your talent system is weird, but I can accept it.\n\nI don't think I've ever had as much fun with a shooter since I played Borderlands, Ubisoft and Techland?

At its core, it's a shoot-em-up arcade game.  That being said, I didn't enjoy it as much as I hoped I would.\n\nPros:\n-The graphics are beautiful, and very well done. A shout out to the graphics department in charge of the game.\n-It's got a very artistic way of portraying the story; Graphic novel style, combined with the narration of an old cowboy telling his story.\n-It's not an easy game, and at times requires trying different routes and tactics to accomplish your goal.\n-There are some great history-bits found as secrets throughout the game. I love me some real-life learning.\n\nCons:\n-Linear, shoot-em-up. There's not much depth to gameplay.\n-A few path bugs. I remember a boss getting glitch stuck inside an environment element, where I was able to hit him safely without him being able to move or shoot back. There were also a number of places where I'd find my own character stuck and unable to move.\n-Sometimes, the controls would bug out to where I couldn't aim, crouch, reload, etc.\n-It got repetitive pretty fast. Even when trying to branch from the norm, as in the case of duels, it didn't feel like there was much depth or learning curve.\n-One last thing that bugged me. In the Xbox 360 version there is the option to turn off swearing and blood, which didn't port over into the PC version. Now, I understand plenty of gamers believe the more gore, the merrier, but I appreciate the chance to share the game with kids and family. Given it's an option in the console version, I'd appreciate seeing it ported over.","May 24","true","1.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"
