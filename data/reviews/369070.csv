It is a series of levels and each one is 99% linear.\n\nSlain! looks great, and it looks even better in motion. But that's the only thing any effort was put into. The controls are awkward and the enemy design is worse. Animation/collision bugs cause your combo to drop or your swings to not complete. 75% of the big enemies can have their AI broken by simply ducking and mashing attack. WHAT!\n\nI feel like this game was not rigorously playtested. This is because when I beat the game in about 4 hours (I didn't finish the sewer level, I think that's an after game challenge level?) I was treated to invisible credits and a soft-lock. Really.\n\nIf you read the credits (via the menu, since the end-game ones never show up) there is no writer credited. Which makes sense, because the sloppy drivel is rife with grammatical and punctuation errors. Phrases like "BTW" and "THX" are used at certain points. Those lines freaking killed my soul. Was this written on a cell phone? Why would they be so lazy here? It almost seems like an intentional middle finger. The stupid thing is, the story could (and should) be completely removed and it would feel much better. Just like old Castlevania games or whatever. No reasons needed, just do some platforming and fighting cool monsters.\n\nI also want to hate on the music, since every one else likes it for some reason. Yes, it is indeed heavy metal and it does use live guitars. But that's it. It's just a constant chug-chug-chug in the background with no variety or even solos. Remember how Symphony of the Night used rock organs and synths and had Baroque pieces, creepy ambience in the caves, and only brought out the rockin' when s*** got REAL? Yeah, that's why it was so GOOD. I guess it's not fair to compare this against what might be the best VG OST of all time, but WHATEVER man. The music in this game doesn't even loop correctly. Ever. Also, I've been a metalhead since my teens (about 20 years going) so it's not a genre thing. Believe me, I was hyped.\n\nTLDR: Super disappointment. Sorry. Wait for Bloodstained to come out a year or so from now.","March 26","false","4.5"," 205 of 226 people (91%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","91","205","226","6","6"

The art direction is great, and the sprite and animation quality is top notch. The music is also pretty good killin' metal, if you're into that. This concludes the positive part of this review. I am also prefacing by saying that I played with a keyboard, as I feel that controllers might have a better go of it.\n\n(EDIT : I have tried playing a controller, and the input delay is gone on that. Everything else said in the review still applies, however)\n\nThere's a phrase I've heard several times now regarding Slain! : "I really wanted to like this game".  And I did, honest! I was instantly sold on it when I saw how it looked. But as it stands as of this review, it is just terrible. I will of course immediately change this review if I see improvement.\n\nThe first problem you'll notice after launching the game is that the controls work only when they feel like it. Navigating the menu is the first obstacle of the game, as hitting the buttons only works sometimes. Once you start playing, you will realize that this is not an isolated issue.  For some reason, certain actions, particularly running, have a significant delay before they come in. I can't imagine WHY, but this sort of feels like it might be intentional, as other buttons work perfectly well, such as the two attack buttons.\n\nAnd I had to personally discover what those buttons are, because the game provides absolutely no insight as to what the controls might be. Arrow keys move your character, and Q and W are the attack buttons. You can press R to do a backdash (a pointless one, by the way, which I'll get to in a bit), and the 1 button shoots a ghostly fireball. You can also duck and hit the W button to expand a full bar of energy to cast a screen-clearing smart bomb. I think there might be a third spell, but I have yet to see it.\n\nI might seem like I don't know a lot about how to play the game, and that's because it's arcane secrets are skillfully hidden by the barely helpful handful of tips you recieve at the top of the screen. As someone who's pretty seasoned in terms of playing video games, though, I can say with confidence that either I completely do not understand how combat in this game works, or the combat system is a broken mess. You have a light and heavy attack button, and you seem to be able to do some combos (I use the word "seem" because I have yet to make them come out reliably), and decapitating opponents gives you more energy for spells. Actually fighting is a joke - Your attacks have hitstun, but the hitstun doesn't always work, either by design or through flaw, which means enemies will often be able to hit you while you're swinging at them.\n\nThe game implies that there is a block in a hint, which I have not yet discovered how to perform, and the backdash is essentially useless because enemies just stand there rapidly swinging, which means you're either going to backdash out of the range of your own attack, or not backdash far enough and just get hit by the next attack that comes. If there is any technique to the fighting, I have not discovered it, and the only way I've made any serious progress through the game is by just running forwards and mashing the light attack button, trading health with enemies as I move along, and using the smartbomb when there's too many of them. The developers apparently expected you to do this, as the levels I've seen so far are generously sprinkled with collectables that fully restore your HP and Energy, further cemeting my theory that this is what I'm supposed to be doing.\n\nThere are three things that will stop your progress- traps, which kill you instantly. Clumps of enemies who hitstun you to death, which I guess can be construed as the player's fault, and Bosses. I have yet to defeat a boss enemy in Slain!. I have encountered two in my time playing, the first of which I was able to just run past and proceed to the next area, and the second one which hurts you when you touch it, which is as far as I got in the game. Bosses are not fun or interesting, they're just big (admittedly cool looking) roided versions of the regular opposition which hit harder and have much more HP.\n\nOutside of the biggest problem which is the gameplay, the game has other issues. There is no way to rebind the keys, and the options menu contains nothing except a single submenu, which is volume control. Aditionally, the dialogue is not only incredibly simplistic and written like a bored forum post, it's also in dire need of a spellcheck. Additionally, whereas the " solid " objects in the game look great, there are some particle effects of a much lower quality that really stand out as an eyesore.\n\nI would describe playing this game as a chore. There is no fun in slaughering your way through the opposition, as the combat is just flat and unimpactful even when it doesn't feel broken. The two areas I've seen are not exactly inspired either, both being a series of alternating flat areas full of monsters and pits full of either monsters or spikes.\n\nThere can be a good game here, there really can. But the very core of the game, the only thing you do in the game, which is the fighting, is just bad. And as such, I cannot recommend this game for anyone, not even as eye candy, because you won't be getting far enough to look at anything significantly pretty. It's just a punishing, janky, unsatisfying screensaver.","March 24","false","1.7"," 252 of 297 people (85%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","85","252","297","11","1"

Let me get this out of the way right off the bat: this isn't an AWFUL game. It looks great... no, it looks SPECTACULAR. This is lovingly crafted stuff: the baddies, the bosses, the backgrounds, the foregrounds, the GROUNDgrounds! It's a slick looking, heavy metal album cover of a game.\n\nBut it all falls apart, unfortunately, like a conversation with a beautiful airhead.\n\n“So what kind of hobbies do you have, Slain!?”\n\n“Pizza!”\n\n“Pizza isn't a hobby, Slain.”\n\n“Horses!”\n\n“Alright, we're done here.”\n\nIt's just kind of... vapid? That's my biggest complaint, and the most damning, unpatchable one. The combat has no impact... and that's CRITICAL for a hack n' slash. What it lacks in combat depth it should make up for in VIOLENT, RADICAL, FEEL-GOOD COMBAT. It doesn't sound good, and it doesn't feel good. The majority of the game you can spam the attack button and watch as the minions of SATAN crumble like so much tissue paper before your standard sword.  Hell, I didn't realize I could switch between elemental weapons or use spirit bombs until halfway through the game (I figured they mentioned fire, ice, and steel as a Game of Thrones reference or something, honestly). I guess that's another issue in and of itself: the game doesn't really explain itself well. “Spirit bombs are great for clearing out tons of enemies!” Thanks game! How in the ♥♥♥♥ do I do that?\n\nAnd besides all that you run along a fairly linear path, slapping switches and jumping on platforms. It's all very uninspired, save for the brilliant art design. And the story? Forgettable. You play as one Geralt - I mean Bathoryn? And you have been brought back to life to destroy evil? And that's that. Go around and kill evil. And the dialogue is bizarrely disjointed - sometimes they stick to the old timey spiel, sometimes there's a weird modern tone that's just short of "LOL."\n\nThis is likely a byproduct of this game having been rushed out the door before it was ready... it was delayed at least twice as far as I know, and it still feels unrefined, unpolished, unfinished. The platforming is MOSTLY okay, but there are some serious spatial issues with some platforms (lookin' at you Wolfswood Caves with your stupid aggravating smashy, insta-death falls if you don't jump on the last frickin' pixel of a GOD DAMN LEDGE ♥♥♥♥). The enemies all look cool, but they're just so much fodder – even the bosses. Slash 'em, run around 'em, slash 'em, rinse and repeat, dead. I seldom had to dodge, just casually smack them as they (in futility) try and break through my attack spamming.\n\nDespite there being checkpoints, if you quit out of the game during a level you have to start the whole damned thing over again – and some of the more frustrating, platformy ones can take a substantial amount of time. If you decide you have somewhere else to be don't quit out until you actually beat the damned boss. Once you beat an area you're free to explore, replay a level... but why would you? It's mostly linear, the combat is unsatisfying, and the “puzzles” aren't all that puzzley.\n\nAt the end of the day this is a gussied up pig. It looks AMAZING – but wipe away the makeup and you'll see it's a Berkshire boar with beady little soulless eyes. Even if they fix the myriad of issues (achievements, control issues, sound issues, typos) this is one to avoid unless heavily discounted.","March 27","false","4.8"," 137 of 159 people (86%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","86","137","159","23","6"

I was looking forward to it for ages but there's just so many problems that they overpower the great atmosphere and badass world the developers have created.\n\nThe general gist is that Slain! comes across a bit like Volgarr The Viking with an old school 'hack and slash' approach set in a beautifully realized metal album cover full of blood and gore and demons of all types. The pixel art is incredible in the vast majority of the game and I can't stress enough how talented the artist is. Sadly I experienced a lot of negatives in my time with Slain. Rather sluggish & stiff controls, repetitive combat (usually you can break enemy AI or mash), iffy collision boxes, difficult to read text/story typeface, confusing and arbitrary level design, music that loops too frequently, frustrating trial & error segments, imbalanced checkpoint placement, janky animations, lack of auditory and visual feedback, audio bugs and barely functioning menus... the list goes on. The game honestly needed a bunch more work and polish before release.\n\nI do appreciate what the developers were going for with Slain! and I believe the concept has a ton of potential, but it just wasn't where it needed to be by launch. I sincerely hope they'll keep addressing the issues after they get more feedback and I'll be happy to change my stance (and review) if that takes place. For now though, I think it may be better to wait on this one.","March 25","false","4.4"," 87 of 108 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","87","108","2","0"

There are so many easy mistakes that could have been avoided and make the game more understandable and enjoyable.\n\n-Nothing is explained correctly:\nI am a dark souls enthousiast and used to game not explaining everything, but if you have a message saying "This ability is great for this", you have to say how you use the ability. Otherwise I will never understand what you are talking about.\nFor example, I have no idea what the "B" attack does nor why it's so weak, I just won't use it.\n\n-The backgrounds, foregrounds are too hard to read:\nI love the art style, but it's almopst impossible to know if something is going to block you and you have to jump over it or if it's just a foreground object. Even some flying blood splatters are hard to differenciate from enemies projectiles.\nOh and side note, and if I can't get onto a ledge under the main path...don't put a ledge there. Anyone who played a 2d sidescoller will expect to be able to jump on that ledge.\n\n-Not understandable hits from the enemies:\nFor this kind of games, it's really important to know when an enemy hits you and why it did.\nHere it feels random. Sometimes, the enemy doesn't do the attack animation and I get hit. Sometimes it does, but i'm guessing I'm in an "invulnurable" animation state and I don't take damage.\nFeels like a bug but I'm not sure it's not intentional.\n\n-Missing sounds?\nDon't know if it's because of the devs wanting the music (not as good as I expected IMO) to be more present but there's so many things that don't have sound effects.\nIt's so noticeable and akward. For example, when you kill a boss, no sound, nothing. Pick up a huge red bloody key, nothing. It makes averything so weird.\n\nThese are the biggest issues with the game. It still has the potential to be a good sidescroller, but right now it feels like an Alpha that should have been early access and waiting for players' feedback","March 26","false","0.5"," 66 of 77 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","66","77","0","1"

You have to hold a button down for about a second just to turn around, due to mistakenly implemented analog sensitivity in Unity even when using a keyboard. Attack combos are an inconsistent mish-mash. I think that duck is the same as block but you're better off trying to bash the attack button since blocking only works on projectiles--meaning if fighting melee & ranged opponents simultaneously, blocking gets you killed.\n\nAfter pressing every key on my keyboard I found a cool looking fireball which was semi-useful.\n\nEarn mana by using 'decapitate' button (W key--you're welcome) but it only works on enemies with very low HP, and it's slow and short-ranged and leaves you vulnerable. It seems to me to be essentially useless since you can't gauge enemy HP (unless you count the hits you've made and know how many it takes, but that's nearly impossible when fihgting 2-3 at once). Even if one of the enemies in a group is low enough, using decap means you'll almost certainly be hit 1-2x by the other guys.\n\nAttempting to hit an enemy and then run or run and turn around and attack again is entirely futile, due to the terrible turn-around speed and very very clunky controls. The dodge key itself didn't prove useful enough to bother with due to the clunkiness (approach enemy, attack, dodge--you're likely to be hit before your attack finishes and the dodge executes).\n\nFortunately, I was able to dispatch groups of enemies by simply standing on a raised ledge, watching them walk endlessly into it, and attacking them whilst crouching. Take that, mindless undead!\n\nMy general feeling about the combat was that MAYBE it would be possible to game it perfectly and get past enemies by maintaining a specific distance, attacking, dodging backward, attacking again but I'm no slouch and after many many lives lost, found it nearly impossible to defeat groups without sustaining damage.\n\nI got so frustrated by the controls after what what was probably my 20th attempt at getting past a section leading up to the "red skelly" right after entering the 1st temple that I closed the game so can't comment any further.\n\nI'll try to check back after some patches have been released in a month or two, and hopefully get a bit further and be able to write a nicer review.\n\nDamn the art is great, though. Still a very inspiring game in that regard.","March 27","false","0.8"," 42 of 50 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","42","50","0","0"

And here's why:\n\nFirst, let's talk about what I loved about it. The art style. The graphics. The visuals... That's about it.\n\nThere are two reasons I hated it, and a couple of nitpicks. First, the sound design is kinda messed up. Things that should to be loud are not, and things that should not be loud, are really loud. I don't know how to explain it. When you play it, the lack of any grunts from the character or enemies seems really weird in a game like this. And the music is either too loud or not loud enough, depending on what setting you put it on. There is no middle ground. And speaking of the music, it was a big let down. At first, it sounds awesome. But then it gets really repetitive real fast. To make my point easier, pretend that you are listening to a Behemoth song with no vocals and no solos... for like 15 minutes... It isn't as good as you would expect.\n\nThe second reason I hated it is the bigger one, which is the combat. Look, for a 2D action game like this, you should either have a 1 or 2 attack style like Castlevania or Rogue Legacy, in which you hit with 1 weapon and 1 move, but you have another attack like throwing knives or something. Or you have the second kind which is fluid combos like Dust: An Elysian Tale or Salt And Sanctuary. You can perform multiple combos with easy to handle timed button presses. This game has neither. Your weapon is too weak and too stiff to use like Castlevania's whip, and your character isn't fast enough to pull it off. And the combo system in the game is just too bad. It needs lightning speed reflexes to pull off a 3 hit combo which isn't even that good. I found that none of my hits give knockback to the enemies. And the fact that you have to be right in front of their pixalated face to be able to hit them means you will be taking a lot of damage as well. The only way I was able to progress without getting much damage is crouching and spamming the hit button, because that attack is the only attack that gives some sort of knockback effect on the enemy... Almost.\n\nOverall, the game is a complete mess, and I was really sad about that. I was so looking forward to it, and it hurts me to see it in such an unplayable mess. I do hope they fix it, but I doubt they will. I'll give it a week... Then I'm gonna refund it if it is still unfinished.","March 26","false","0.5"," 46 of 58 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","46","58","0","0"

I'm not even going to go into detail on how underwhelmingly useless the "decapitation" attack is.\n\nArt style? Yeah, it's alright... it's a little unremarkable though, nothing in the game jumped out at me as striking or impressively constructed.\n\nMusic? It's run of the mill metal, at times it doesn't even feel like it fits the level design, speaking of...\n\nLevel design is exceptionally poor. Run forward, jump over the occassional trap, the platforming elements are tedious and for the pace of the combat the levels are entirely too long.\n\nUltimately Slain presents itself as a game with "stunning visuals and true old school gameplay" now if by old school gameplay they meant a throwback to the platformers of Spectrum Sinclair and Commodore 64 era with sloppy combat mechanics and terrible flow of design or gameplay then they definitely hit the nail on the head.\n\nThis game seems like it was constructed around the concept of "Darksouls YOU DIED! was really funny, hurr, lets make something that immitates that." but has completely failed to realize that responsive combat and a world constructed around death being designed to teach you a lesson rather than as a result of you not spamming the attack button fast enough results in an exceptionally sub-par product.\n\nI cannot recommend this game to anyone and I am entirely doubtful that sufficient changes to the feel of the character movement, level design, combat or over-all pacing will ever take place.\n\nUltimately, this game is not fun to play.","March 26","false","0.5"," 41 of 53 people (77%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","77","41","53","5","1"

A lot of the major problems that Slain has to do with basic game and level design: there's some basic problems regarding the different gameplay parts working together in harmony: which is a major problem. The level design can be nasty at times, relying on trial and error more then environment recognition or skill. Now it's not that hard in terms of difficulty: the game relies on exploiting the AI and using pattern recognition to not taking damage. And at first, that works. But it's the lack of enemy variety in combination of repeating the levels over and over again that makes the experience hard to drag through. It's not the scourge of the earth as some other reviews have said, but the game frustrated me from the get go, and continued to do it without offering something that great in return. It doesn't help that the engine lacks precision, as not only will enemies can hit you in death animations, but the game will spawn enemies on top of you regardless of fairness or not. And don't get me started on a PC game launched with this kind of keyboard support, it's one of the worst I've seen, and that's for a game that was delayed SEVERAL times. It's a shame, I was really looking forward to the game, and it just couldn't deliver in the end.\n\nLists:\nPositives:\nAesthetic. A strong artstyle along with some great music. You haven't really seen a game like this.\nSlow methodical gameplay that relies on memorization and pattern recognition. Has an original castlevania element to it: find the way to exploit the AI to avoid damage and dying.\nThe different elemental weapons does add some variety to the gameplay due to enemy weaknesses and weapon range.\nGood alternative wolf section that varied the gameplay up.\nThe game works well for the gameplay in question for the controller. It takes time to get used to, but it's more about slow and steady gameplay more then anything else.\nThose who are able to pick up on small environmental hints will do well in this game. A sharp eye is almost required without relying on trial and error gameplay.\nNegatives:\nKeyboard controls are horrible. The game should not have launched in this state with it being a PC port, or at least have required the use of a controller. Inexcusable.\nTrial and Error gameplay. This can be seen on multiple levels: but for example: the game will spawn enemies right on top of you, and if it's the first time you've been in an area, you're in for a nasty shock as you have no time to react. You only learn where they spawn, then can deal with it.\nLack of precision on the engine at times, as you can be hit by dead enemies.\nLevel Design is very poor at times, leading to unavoidable traps and nasty situations that ask too much of the player.\nLack of enemy variety. You'll face the same basic enemies over and over again at times.\nNeeded a secondary weapon system to deal with specific situations. Similar to games like Castlevania, as there's are times where you've got no room to manuever due to a specific situation, and needed something as a get out of jail free card.\nWhile the aesthetic is strong at times, it can go against the main gameplay in question as it can be hard to see things at times.\nLevels can be too long for the lack of a more consistent save system. Especially with the gameplay relying on memorization.\nBugs can pop up at the wrong time. Some of them are hilarious, but they can really take away from the experience, like taking a boss out entirely.","April 4","false","5.5"," 29 of 38 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","29","38","0","0"

Let me list of some things before I even get started.\n\n1. The combat is good up till you go up against enemies that take way too many hits which is up to the level with the wolf knight guys.\n\n2. Pixel perfect jumps to avoid instant death which you may end up dieing due to not being able to do that. You will lose mana alot due to that too so good luck keeping it.\n\n3. Too much frustrating and unnecessery enemies that do way too much damage or lock you in attacks making it impossible to do enough damage to kill anything.\n\n4. Dodging and timing it a complete joke the backdash barely works and if your lucky you might not get hit. If lucky by a miracle you even can get past an overpowered enemy.\n\n5. If you quit out of the game you have to restart the entire level all over again and also no checkpoint you start from either.\n\nThis is considered a metroidvania type of game? There is not even a speck of any kind of that in this false tagged game. This game is basically 2D Dark Souls, but without the leveling, equipment to help with unbeatable fights or barely beatable, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dodging that barely does save your ♥♥♥, and will make you tear your hair out or smash your computer due to the unnecessarily difficult broken enemies or enviroment. If your a masochist or glutton for punishment then enjoy this nightmare of game. I only made it through the prologue and then tried the two other areas, before finally giving up on the wolf ruins part. I rather not cause my anger to raise anymore then it needs to along with my blood-pressure.\n\nPlus went back to it to see if I could get through the game some more turns out the achievements didn't register when I beat the Thorn boss and the Banshee Queen. This game is pretty much broken as ♥♥♥♥. Plus why even have ice and fire enhancement pickups if you can select them with your control-pad or joystick? Not that they help anyways since the axe is pretty much the only useful weapon in the game since it can do more knockback and you pretty much have to relay on cheap spamming attacks. I complained about the combat being bad, but I forgot to mention about the unkillable blood wolf which I got to in the wolf level. I swear to god you cannot even kill it at all I tried using the axe and also the other weapon types. Yet none of them do anything at all plus the blood wolf sometimes respawns even if you don't kill the wolf knights or guard or whatever the hell you wanna call them. For the love of god this is too broken to play.","March 26","false","2.7"," 28 of 37 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","28","37","0","0"

The art looks excellent, animations look fluid, the sound is ok too, I myself had been keeping an eye on this game for a while which makes writing this review kind of sad.\n\nWhere the game drops the ball is the gameplay. There are so many problems even playing the game the way the devs recommended, with a controller and everything the game still feels unresponsive, the hit detection feels awkward, trying to do anything after getting hit ended up being more of a gamble than anything else, there isn't any post hit invicibility or a considerable push back to give you space. Which means you won't always know for sure if you're getting hit until a monster brutally murders you in two or three hits. The dodge move was useless due to the start-up frames leaving you open to getting hit since it takes a bit to actually move away, attacking is actually quicker.\nSpeaking of attacking, even the input of the basic combo doesn't always respond as it should making it another gamble if you're trying to cancel the combo into a decapitation move to restore mana, sometimes I managed to pull it off perfectly but most times it felt like the game just refused to do it and it would either stop around the second hit or do the normal 3-hit combo despite me pressing the button only twice. Also getting the first hit due to how the controls respond also felt like I was making a bet rather than being skillful.\nIt all feels very loose, devoid of necessary feedback to the player. It needs to have tighter, more responsive controls that would allow to pull off moves and possibly tactics well which even if they pulled off I'm sure it would retain the level of challenge they were going for. But as it stands, during release, the game is difficult for the wrong reasons and quite a shame too since I really can't give it enough praises over how good and different it looks.\n\nIf you want a challenging 2D Platformer you're better off playing Volgarr the Viking or classics like the 2D Castlevanias, at least there the controls respond perfectly and the whole game feels tighter and meatier. Hopefully the devs will take the feedback and either patch this while looking at where other games got it right or do a better job on their next game. Personally I would like to see them fix this game by overhauling the gameplay and if they do I'd consider playing it all the way.","March 26","false","0.3"," 26 of 35 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","26","35","0","0"

As of the latest update, it no longer recognizes my Xbox One controller. It seems the developers of this game are really struggling to get this game in proper working condition. As I mentioned earlier, if this were Early Access, I can excuse it. But this is a full-fledged release, and this is simply inexcusable. I mentioned that in a few months time, maybe this game will get better. Instead, it got WORSE. That's not how it works, Wolf Brew.\n\nThis game has potential. It's a 2D side-scroller that reminds me a lot of Castlevania and Metroid, with a nice art style, amazing animation and a cool soundtrack. So why am I giving it a "Not Recommended" rating? Well, the controls and combat feel sluggish, the game doesn't bother giving you a tutorial (or even a basic explanation of controls), the hit detection is off, and there are oddly no sound effects (the repetitive music, as nice as it sounds, doesn't help). If this were an Early Access title, I'd let it off easy, but this is a full-fledged release, and such issues like this are hard to ignore. Maybe in a few months time it will get better, but as it is I find it not worth $12.99.","March 30","false","0.4"," 22 of 28 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","22","28","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kilooscar/recommended/369070/","kilooscar","KiloOscar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kilooscar/","362 products in account","So, this is a very early review because I feel like some of the early negative reviews are not fully thought out. I will try to keep it simple.\n\nI:\nI have no issues with controller lag. I use an Xbox 360 controller to play, I do get a second or so of lag with the keyboard (left and right direction only) so this must be a keyboard issue only, for now. I was about to see what they meant after I got the first sword powerupgrade to realize that these specific enemies, not going spoil anything, are better to fight without the powerupgrade. Sword powers are interchangeable or can be turned off. This adds a little tactic and strategy, which is a positive in my eyes. Also, people might be trying to play this game on to high of a setting for their computer, which unsurprisingly could cause input lag and FPS drops.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE Before playing the game you get a box that lets you choose graphic display such as resolution, quality, window or fullscreen, and Display 1 (2,3, etc.). The same box also shows you the controller and keyboard setup, which you can reassign the keys (Only movement keys can be reassigned). So, knowing which keyboard keys to press can be a mystery. Seems that QWER (attack), 1234...(Mana attack/swordupgrade), P (pause) and ENTER are used but I haven't played much with the keyboard controls.\n\nII:\nSound, yes the soundtrack is great. However, I agree it is a little loud. So what I did was go into options and turned it down a notch and guess what?! it made sound way better and I now hear all the little game sounds as well (e.g. foot steps, swinging sword, etc.). I also have good headphones so that might help. Also, if the soundtrack bores you than change how you play and try to get past that specific area instead of getting slain or mute it until you get past that area you keep having to repeat. PS the slain death screen is great.\n\nIII:\nI have read discussion forums that GOG had an earlier build on release date and most people seem to be writing reviews off of that wrong release or not realizing everything offered to them; Or, some other technical issue that I seem not to have.\n\nIV:\nYou can exit the screen withOUT Alt+Tab, no idea why someone said that only Alt+Tab will let you exit.\n\nV:\nSome letters in the game are hard to read due to the font choice, but logical guessing from storyline and other words I can make out what is being stated.\n\nVI:\nThe pixel art is beautiful and I cannot wait to see what other enemies await as so far there has been a good mix.\n\nVII:\nVariety in attacks, including mana and weapon upgrades seem adequate and rather more than I expected them to include. I expected something closer to Castlevania but get a lot more and I am talking about NES castlevania style/types of weapon and attack choices.\n\nVIII:\nYes you will be Slain! as the name implies and you know, I am okay with that. The popular Dark Souls is constant death as well as many other games, including this one, and for many this may be a new thing, but I think a good thing. Prepare to be Slain! is a no joke saying with this game.\n\nI am enjoying this game and I do hope others see this review after reading the negative reviews. I would recommend this game to my friends and even bought a copy for a friend that also loves this genre.\n\nI definitely will have more than .3 hrs after this review as long as my non-gaming life allows and if it really goes to pooper later in the game I will update my review.

Lots of great colours splashed about gothic-medieval architecture paint this game wonderfully. This game is wonderfully bright and dankly dark at the same time, and that is shown well with the levels of scrolling seen between the foreground, midground and background.\n\nSadly, the art is the only thing I find great at this time. The controls, in which I'm playing with an Xbox One controller, are clunky. It's as if the developers grew up, like myself, playing Castlevania. Now, I love Castlevania. I will gladly play some hardcore Castlevania or Super Castlevania and then cross the bridge right into some Symphony of The Night or Aria of Sorrow. However, that's what this game's gameplay feels like to me: that bridge.\n\nThe developers seem to have created their own bridge, but it's a little rickety. Slain! is a cross between the old school Castlevania and Symphony of the Night, but unfortnately they didn't find the right balance between the two. In Castlevania, the devs understood that enemies needed a wind up and to be kept at a length, hence the whip or the long arc for the sword. Slain! gave me a fat sword that doesn't really seem like this amazing warrior would use (except to butter his toast) because the range is laughably short and he swings it like I have to tell him how.\n\nAnd he can't block unless he crouches.\n\nI assume maybe there will be longer, better weapons in the game, but at this point, with the game telling me nothing about how to play the game, ie. crouching makes you block and the B button is for decapitations, I don't exactly care to play that far into it. The mixture of slow, unresponsive controls and sludge metal is not a good mix. I enjoy grindy metal at times, but when your game feels like a gelatinous cube, and it's okay to have a game feel that slow, it may be best to tuck away the sludge metal for later.\n\nIn some way I want to recommend this game, because it looks gorgeous and maybe with a fix to the responsiveness it could be a lot of fun, but I can't do it. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game. The problems with Slain! bum me out as I was so very much looking forward to an ultra-dark heavy metal kind of vibe in a video game, but this is a whoops.","March 24","false","0.4"," 39 of 61 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","39","61","0","0"

The sprites are detailed and the animations are fluid.\n- The soundtrack fits the setting and is well composed.\n\nCons:\n- Controls are clunky and unresponsive.\n- Story is boring.\n\nAlright, so my main beef with the game is that it just doesn't feel good to play it. Attacking feels like it has no weight behind it so it's more like swinging a piece of cardboard EVEN when hitting an enemy. It's like just slashing through the air. Killing an enemy feels more like a chore than satisfying combat because all you do is button spam until the horde stops stumbling towards you. As for enemies that don't have knock back, such as a boss, you can't do a normal combo on them because your character moves forward as he attacks which just ends up making you run into him and take damage yourself... so pretty much you spam magic until you run out and then jump slash for the rest of the fight.\n\nAlso the controls are not explained at all ingame.\nHere's the controls from what I figured out on a controller.\n\n360 pad controls:\n\nA - Jump\nX - Slash (spam for "combo")\nB- Decapitation Slash (for mana recovery)\nRB- Magic\nLB - Backwards dash/dodge\n\nOh yeah, and pointing downwards on the left stick is BLOCK.\n\nDevs, if you read this I would love to just offer a few suggestions on what I, personally, feel that your game could benefit from.\n\n- Teach us the controls in a creative way.\nI'm not saying put up one of those "Here's the controls, got it memorized? Cool" screens but build the first level in a way that teaches the controls by way of obstacles that don't straight up punish the players immediately.\nFor example: Teaching a player how to attack could be done by way putting a door in the way in the first room. Just paint an "X" on the wall in blood or whatever and us players can put two and two together to press X to break the wall. COOL! We just solved a "puzzle" by ourselves and you didn't have to hand-hold us through it! This approach could be taken further by having the wall maim an enemy on the other side of it where we could be taught about Decapitation attacks by having a B somewhere or something. I just find this approach a non-invasive way to teach controls so noobs can solve it without having to read and vets can just blaze through without having to spam A through a wall of text... much like what you're reading right now... >_>\n\n- Give attacks more weight\nLike I said earlier, attacking just feels like cutting through the air and accidentally shredding an enemy that feels like it's made of paper. I think the main reason it feels this way is the lack of feedback we get from connecting a hit on an enemy. Possibly consider giving the enemy a little more knockback, some visual embellishments (like a spray of blood on flesh, shards of bone on skeletons, or sparks on armor), and more intense sound effects. Screen shake isn't a horrible idea either. The small project called "Grave" by Heartbeast is an excellent example of well-executed and SATISFYING feedback.\n\n- Less clunky movement.\n"Slain!" just feels clunky... I just don't know another way to put it. It's movement system is very cut and dry. It's like "move. stop. attack. stop. get hit. stop..." Anytime something in a game inhibits my controls it frustrates me, like a pause inbetween actions like your character has to stop and think about his next move every single time. The protagonist in "Slain!" seems like he'd be a well-oiled fighting machine that could quickly chain together different moves from his arsenal, instinctually, but he doesn't feel that way. He feels more like a clanky robot that's in dire need of some WD-40 or whatever.\nNow admittedly, this is totally a personal preference of mine and I totally understand if you were going for the stilted movement of a game like "Castlevania" but  it just doesn't feel right in "Slain!". "Castlevania" was a precision platformer, in my opinion, where every action you made felt calculated and purposeful. However "Slain!" just feels like a button mashing mess in it's current state. I suggest giving him a little bit of momentum when he starts and stops running, a dash attack perhaps, less abrupt halts in his previous actions, and also knockback instead of just a brief second of sitting still helplessly when attacked.\n\n- Get us excited!\nA bit vague? Yeah I know, sorry, but what I'm trying to articulate is that it doesn't feel rewarding to do stuff in Slain.\nThe first boss is slow and kind of boring, which I understand, it's the first boss, it should be easy, but it was easy in the wrong way, in my opinion. The hardest parts about that boss were jumping over him when he was a ball because his hitbox is wider than his body and then accidentally damaging myself because I comboed into his body and took contact damage... There was no exciting reflex testing or using clever mechanics that we were taught in the first level. AND THEN after we kill him, what do we get? A key... a key that is pretty much useless because all we can do with it is open the door to the 2nd level. What's the use of the key if that's the direction we have to go anyway? AND THEN we get a wall of text to read... See what I'm saying about getting us excited? There should be a sweet new ability or leveling up our health or mana or... anything really!\nI don't wanna be that guy and say "ThIS Is HOw i wOUld hAVe DEsiGnEd thE BOsS" but ♥♥♥♥ it, I am. Make his roll attack faster inherently making it easier to jump over, allow his green, poison orbs to shoot out faster and also be shot back at him (allowing for a more creative way to attack him), then after hitting him with enough green orbs he gets knocked down into a vulnerable state where you can run up and beat on him for a bit until he recovers. Repeat until dead. After he's dead you get a new magic move like umm... Hold up and Press B or something and you summon up a row of vines like he does in one of his moves. That would be excited to me anyway. Exciting boss fight + new game mechanic REWARD = Satisfyed gamer.\n\nDisclaimer! If I came of rude in this review it was not my intention, and I didn't mean for this to become a game design rant. I merely wanted this game to be more satisfying than it turned out to be for me.\nThanks for your time if you read any of this.","March 25","false","1.2"," 22 of 32 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","22","32","0","0"

I thought 'Damn these graphics, yummy! It must be a decent game.'\n\nI hate to say it, but it's not.\n\nIt does lack the basic tutorials but that's ok with me, you only have so many buttons on the controller and you can easily figure them out in a few tries.\n\nBut gameplay wise it's just lacking, controls are clunky, and as a result the combat is bland at best. For example about 10 minutes in, the game tells you that 'you've awaken the [insert mini boss name here]' Wow scary! But how do you beat it? The controls are just too jerky for you to hit the boss once and run away to dodge its attacks, and I died several times trying to do so. I then got bored and started to mash buttons, guess what, the boss was killed by button mashing, since the boss staggers everytime therefore you can just combo it to its demise. It does not reward you for playing smart, but instead you just mash buttons to win. (at least for the first parts of the game)\n\nIt might not be fair to draw any final conclusions about this game, for I only have less than 20 minutes with it, but I can safely say that it didn't leave a very good first impression.

Even if there was a "controls" screen telling you keyboard controls would be helpful in at least properly mapping a controller. Instead I had to start the game and do process of elimination. Took much longer than it should have. Your character gets stun locked way too often even when in mid attack. It's just unfortunate because the game looks so good. Also, when I finally did get all the controls properly mapped with Joystick Mapper, I would be hitting the "behead control" and it would randomly shoot the spirit skulls and waste my mana when I didn't even hit that button.

The only thing that's better in Slain! are graphics. Everything else is much, much worse. So sad I backed this on Kickstarter, can't get the refund. If there was only a bug here or there, I would have hope that it can be fixed. But it's not about the bugs here (actually haven't encountered any), it's about poor game design, really bad controls, missing sound effects… In the games mentioned above there was at least some feedback / knock back when you get hit by an enemy, in Slain! enemies walk through you. Sure, all this can be fixed but it’s not a question of days but rather months. At this stage, I would suggest to the developers to slap the “early access” badge on this and take it from there.\n\nEDIT #3:\n\nHoooraaay! Patch 1 is out! It fixes sooo many things! Oh, wait... it's just for Win. No patch for OSX and Linux. But the store page says the game supports OSX and Linux?

At the beginning a monster spawns from the ground, blood sprays from the pit, visually very dramatic… no sound… no ground rumbling, no sound of blood spraying, the monster is mute. Fire gargoyles spit fireballs from their mouths… no sound at all.  Monsters make engine revving like sound which starts quietly, then gradually goes louder, then ends abruptly and then starts over in a loop. Skeletons make a fireplace crackling like sound (bones?) but die without making any sound… The list goes on and on. And I’ll remind you all that one of the Kickstarter stretch goals (which WAS reached) was hiring “dedicated professional audio designer”.","March 24","false","2.6"," 20 of 29 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","20","29","0","0"

I WANTED Slain! to be good. I had phone reminders set for MONTHS to check for a release date and bought it regardless of the negative reviews to really try this game for myself.\n\nShame on you, Wolf Brew Games. This game was my most anticipated title of 2016 thus far and it is awful. AWFUL. None of this lived up to what it was advertised to be, and it is due to gripes that are apparent within the first 15 minutes of gameplay. I view preview material with a good amount of wiggle room, as I know how much can change within development, but this is unacceptable. Let me break it down in bullet form:\n\n- This was toted in many different outlets like it was going to be a Metroidvania styled adventure. It was not, and that will become apparent with subsequent bullet points.\n\n- The graphics and certain animations are GORGEOUS, but the game as a whole is a mess. It lacks personality, and right from the opening cutscene there's none to be found in the game. Just because a few idling animations and sword swings look pretty doesn't mean the game feels cohesive.\n\n- The sound design is virtually nonexistent. Even after turning down the (so far, repetitive) music, there was almost no sound to be heard. Super Meat Boy has more sound effects for running and squishing than Slain! has for "epic" combat, and Super Meat Boy's are louder.\n\n- Like some other reviewers mentioned, this game feels like a Flash game in many regards, and not in a good way. The intro contains poorly written dialogue, with horrible text formatting. The animations that weren't the few good ones featured in previews are janky and quickly repetitive. I found myself walking past areas that triggered popup text and even dialogues from NPCs, that quickly vanished without allowing me to stop and read them. This included what looked like it would be useful gameplay information, if I could finish reading it.\n\n- There is no reliable way to find out what Bathoryn can do. The controls are trial and error, and from what I was able to figure out, there is no depth to combat. I'm okay with simple combat, if it has flow, but killing enemies is actually boring; hacking and slashing is boring in a hack and slash game. I see what you were attempting with the button timing for the sword swings, but it feels unresponsive instead of rewarding.\n\n- The challenge is horrible. I think in all the battles I fought with enemies both large and small, I died ONCE to combat, and did not struggle at all aside from that. At the same time, however, I found myself in situations where I did not have any techniques at my disposal to adequately deal with the combat at hand. In one room, there were a bunch of flying enemies near the ceiling, so I had to awkwardly keep jumping off of a platform and swinging blindly to kill everything instead of being able to properly engage them in combat. Bigger enemies can be dispatched by walking away and mashing your spell attack until they crumble, like other reviews point out. The only things that really ended up killing me were the ridiculous traps and pitfalls, not because they're treacherous, but because they're random and uncalled for. The moving platforms are incredibly tedious, and some of them even move randomly and require blind faith when you jump since you can't see the next one from where you stand. It doesn't really matter anyway, since there are overly convenient checkpoints whenever a real threat presents itself. Now for the traps. Yes, they're "hidden" but they're not cohesive with the layout of the level. They're placed where you can either see them easily and avoid them, or where they're not actually "hidden" so much as "there so enemies can push you into them." It's just a treacherous one hit death jump, not a trap. They're fancier versions of the aforementioned pits.\n\n- The game over screen doesn't even have unique sounds and music. It just keeps playing the same song from the level until you respawn.\n\n- There's no inventory system or map, you just mindlessly go right and sometimes find a weapon that the game vaguely describes without giving you a choice of using a weapon you already had. Just like the dialogues from earlier in my review, you can blink and almost miss the text.\n\nThis game feels incredibly rushed and unpolished for a game that had countless positive press, a successful Kickstarter, and extremely promising preview material. I'll be keeping my copy for the Deluxe Edition art content, but I'm warning everyone to stay away from this game until further notice. What a shame.","March 25","false","0.4"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","0"

The last thing I want is to discourage the developers, because their heart was in the right place here, it just didn't work this time.\n\nFirst and foremost, the controls are beyond clunky, and not in a charming Castlevania 1-3 way, where it's an art to adjust to the slow pace and deadly jump mechanics. but this is more like you're never sure if what you're trying to do is actually going to happen when you press the button. It just makes the game really frustrating to play, especially when you get lucky and make a lot of progress only to have the unresponsiveness and poor hit detection fail you at the worst time, and then have to start all over again. Also, it's kind of strange to be thrown into the game and have no idea what the controls are. I understand it's a relatively simple game, and I appreciate being spared an annoying unnecessary tutorial, but at least an option to view the controls in the options menu would have been nice. For example, there is text early in the game telling you to block projectiles...but no mention as to how to do so. If you're going to break the fourth wall by giving the player text instructions on the screen, you might as well go all the way and tell them how to do it, otherwise it's pointless. Of course I WANT to block the projectiles, I don't need to be told that. I only found out by accident about 20 minutes later that crouching is apparently a block, at least I think so. I managed to block about 50% of the projectiles by crouching. Also, when you go to quit the game, the character jumps upon selecting Quit from the pause menu. Not a big deal, doesn't take away from the experience, but just seems like another weird control thing that makes the game seem rushed and unfinished.\n\nIn addition to the control issues, I felt like the overall gameplay was very one-dimensional. You have 2 melee attacks, but the longer attack seems completely useless. There is nearly a full second pause after the attack ends where you are left vulnerable. No matter how I tried to use it, or how quickly I backdashed away from the enemy after, the...I guess we'll call it the red attack, led to me taking damage 100% of the time, and doesn't seem to do any more damage to the enemy than the basic attack. Or at least, not enough to justify taking damage yourself in exchange every time you use it. The level design was also kind of generic and unexciting. Not visually so, but the layout was predictable and didn't keep me interested, mostly just a direct line from left to right, jumping a few gaps along the way. The monsters were fine, decent enough variety early on, but without much audible feedback when fighting them, they also got tired quickly.\n\nOn that note, the sound is another major issue. The music is ok, but a bit more repetitive than expected, which gets old very quickly when you're stuck trying to trudge through one area for a long period of time hearing the same 2 power chords chugging for 15 minutes. As for the sound effects, they are barely there at all. By default, both music and sfx are set to 10 volume. After a few minutes, I turned the music down to 9, then 8, then 7, and kept turning my speaker volume up just to be able to hear the sound fx at all, but they are rather bland and generic sounding, which is a buzzkill. Sound is a big deal in a game like this. You want that big violent explosion of sound every time you kill something. Not to keep comparing to Castlevania, but in Symphony of the Night for example, every one of the 100+ monsters in that game had a unique death sound that was percussive with some burning noises and occasionally some howling/screaming that matched up perfectly with the dying animation...it makes the kills incredibly satisfying, and pulls you into the world. SotN wouldn't be nearly as legendary without the incredible sound design. Not that I held this to the same standard, obviously a very different situation, but in Slain, the only thing you hear is some soft clinking metal sounds and whooshing. It really cheapens the whole experience.\n\nIn spite of the poor gameplay and sound, I do have to say the game looks amazing. This is some of the best pixel art I've seen in recent memory. Everything about the game is visually beautiful, and before playing it, I thought even if the game wasn't stellar, it would be a pleasure to play just for the visuals, but unfortunately that wasn't the case. I wish I could have enjoyed more of the scenery, but after about an hour, I'd had enough.\n\nI appreciate the effort that went into this, and I can tell what the intent of the game was, but it has too many problems to be enjoyable in this state. It just feels incomplete. If I had played this as an early access title, I could give a pass to a lot of these problems while the bugs are still being worked out, but it was sold as a complete game, and it really could have used a little more time in the oven.","March 25","false","0.8"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","0"

Please leave a review on the store page as soon as you have installed and played to help us gain some early momentum"\n\nSo here is my review.\n\nThis could have been a great game, except for a number of flaws. The most prominent of these, is that NOTHING is ever explained to you; which would be fine, but the control scheme is almost entirely unintuitive. To add to that, the UI in this game was definitely not designed well, going through the menus, the only indication to what option you have selected, is that the option turns a slightly different shade of red, now I imagine the irritation of this is compounded because I am colourblind, but I can't see this being pleasant for anyone else either. Any other flaws past this, I can't really elaborate on, as they might just be parts of more unexplained gameplay. For example, flying enemies up higher than my jump attack, that very rarely descend while raining down attacks? I have no way of attacking them, but perhaps I have an unexplained vertical ranged attack.\n\nI was looking forward to this game, and UI aside, it really is a beautiful game, and I really wanted to like it, but I can't play this as it is.

I was so ecstatic when this game finally released. What I have played of it, so far, has been unfortunately disappointing. I will say that the graphics are absolutely stellar. This game really does have a lot going for it. However, the game's biggest issue right now is the controls. Jumping doesn't seem to have a delay, but moving left and right has a very frustrating delay to it. I can understand the attacks having a delay; it makes me think of the old Castlevania games that I absolutely loved. There's no way to tell that an enemy has hit you; you pretty much stand there and soak damage. If the enemies could knock you back, then the fights would have been far more engaging. The game has a decent foundation, but I cannot recommend it in its current state.","March 24","false","1.4"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

XBox360, Logitech F310, StrikeNX, 8BITDO SNES PRO 30, even an Xbox Street Fighter stick. All work beautifully now. Now if you guys would just get rid of that redundant splash screen with the controller mapper and resolution chooser this game might actually be a contender for the best action platformer I've ever played on PC, period. (Granted I'm only half way through my second play through but wow. It feels like a whole new game.) Amazing improvement. Good job! (But please, if you want to make it better please don't let me stop you. But if it gets much better I might have to revise it to "Best Side Scrolling 2D Platformer I've ever played on anything.") And I was born in 1977 so believe me that's saying something.\n\n\nAs of patch 1 Slain is now the game I was waiting for 9 months for. (There are a few niggles left as patch 1 now makes my 360 wired controller work beautifully but breaks compatibility with my Logitech F310.) Patch 1.5 coming in a couple of weeks should fix this as they say they are going to make all the controls customizable in game as well as allowing you to switch to the D-pad in software  (Which is good.)  I made the mistake of trying to remap controls with the nearly indecipherable control mapper that starts when the game starts. Do not do this as it there is NO "reset to default" button and apparently no ini file to edit as a workaround that anyone can find. (For now just enjoy it with a 360 controller or whatever you can get to work. Keyboard works now too with no lag.) The developer fixed so many things with patch 1 I have confidence they will get the other stuff fixed very soon in patch 1.5 and 2.0. The game itself... when it works... is REALLY good.","May 28","true","25.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

First impression is that this game has lots of potential, but really feels like a beta release. I can tell that a lot of love went into making this game and I'd be happy to update the review if the game is also updated/improved.\n\nPros:\nBeautiful art and animations (particles are very loud though)\nMusic is solid, but the sound mixing is pretty far off (had to turn the music down to 7 just to hear game SFX)\nGreat thematic. Skulls and blood and metal!\n\nCons:\n- No viscerality. This is my biggest disappointment. When I hit or get hit with a huge ♥♥♥ sword, I want it to feel like that. Give me audio feedback when I flip a switch. I want to hear that platform move. Etc. Lack of feedback makes the gameplay feel hollow.\n- No invulnerability frames and I get stunned on hit? What was the thought behind this? It adds some artificial difficulty, but mostly just feels bad. Getting stunned out of the spin and being unable to move but having no indication as to having been hit other than unresponsive controls is no fun.\n- Sound effects are all but non-existant. I muted the music to hear the SFX and it seems like half of them just aren't there. Like I mentioned above, lack of sound really detracts from overall feel.\n- Basic attack combo is untuned. Thrust hitbox projection + knockback is super strong. Decapitation move gives back mana, but mostly feels like a trap. 3rd part of combo, the down slash, is nigh on inaccesible. X spammed my way through the first level. The Anubis guys in the woods seemed less susceptible to that method, but only played a bit.\n\nMINOR GREIVANCES\n- Moveset between sword and axe is identical (aside from knockback)? More of a missed opportunity.\n- Why tell me I should block if you don't tell me how to do it?\n- Dash only goes backward, but it functions as a move cancel as well. Odd design choice that doesn't mesh with the rest of the controls.\n- Menu control is sluggish and also still controls you in game while it's open.\n- Badguy says "BTW" at one point. The cheesey metal story is kinda fun, but this was really jarring.\n- Enemy collision is unintuitive. Hit detection feels right, but some mobs you can just stand inside of. I literally stood inside the volcano dogs and spammed X to kill them.\n- Changing settings to 'fastest' makes the controls slightly better.","March 24","false","1.3"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

I have 681 games, some of them pretty lackluster and a few are maybe bad.  But this one...  It just makes me sad.  The art style looked incredible, the trailers were great.  I'm playing with a gamepad so I got none of the input lag, but the combat just isn't fun.  The sound effects basically aren't there, the intro was weirdly silent and went on too long and was riddled with minor typos and grammatical errors.\n\nI had exactly 5 minutes of game time before I requested my refund.  I'm sorry, Wolf Brew Games, but this needs a lot more work before it's ready.\n\n1. Get rid of the awful looking "high res" blood that comes out of enemies when you hit them.  Having your beautiful spritework clash with stuff that looks like default after effects is really jarring, and does the game no favors.  This actually really irked me.  Pick an art style and stick with it, man!\n\n2. Combat needs massive improvements to impacts.  We need hits to really connect, make high quality "chunky" sounds and visibly stop or slow enemies, as it stands they react like an older Newgrounds flash game, where you swing wildly and the enemy kind of sort of backs up a bit but shows no indication that you're murdering it.\n\n3. Music is good, but repetitive.  Get some more tracks made!\n\nI'm sure there'd be more for me to say if I had played more, but that I already have a list that damning in 5 *minutes* of play is... not good.

For example, when landing after a jump or walking off a platform there is no sound effect. Also, there is a stone wall that you must break in the blood grounds and it makes absolutely no sound when doing so.

The pixel art is top notch and wonderful that portrays a Gothic atmosphere. From the screenshots and everything I saw, this felt like a winner. So, I gave it the chance. Boy was I wrong...\n\nThe game starts in a Legacy of Kain-ish style in a tomb. Which caught my eye, as I was looking around the tomb awestruck. Then, I walked outside. The graphics were indeed what was told. It was dark, moody, and overall breathtaking. Beat up a few baddies, and start to notice something completely out of line.\n\nThe controls are NES bad. The ground combos of Bathoryn are so sluggish and slow, that the delay in pressing the button is extremely noticeable. Enemies getting in cheapshots, because the reaction of the character is delayed. I started to learn very quickly to not fight on the ground, but use jump attacks. That way I was able to at least time my attacks correctly. But, even then running into the first "bigger" enemy made me realize another major flaw.\n\nThe game sells itself on his "heavy metal" and soundtrack. For 15 minutes, I had to listen to the same 25-30 second metal loop over and over. Now, I love me some death metal, hardcore, J-Metal, and more. But, the reason why the movie Heavy Metal works is because that it wasn't just the same rift playing, the music controls and creates the atmosphere as well as the visionals. So, the music didn't help create the atmosphere of the game, when you have a dark and brooding game. The metal needs to be dark and brooding.\n\nOverall, I loved what I saw in the videos. I feel in love with the graphics. But, it's very clear the moment you leave the tomb at the start of the game, the game is missing the polish and the shine. The atmosphere, which is visually stimulating, falls lower than flat due to it's the repetitive sounds and music. In the end, I had to ask for a refund, as I am extremely disappointed with everything but the visuals.","March 24","false","0.2"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","15","23","0","0"

Players will control Bathoyrn, a hero in the gothic world, seeing to liberate seven great towers from 7 deadly overlords.\n\nGameplay is played from a side view, and you have to hack and slash your way through levels, using heavy attacks, quick attacks or magical spells. A lot of the negative reviews on Steam are pointing out that the game has poor unresponsive controls. Whilst this is true in some points, I feel like it is not as big of an issue that people are making out. Not to mention the developers have already acknowledges the issues and are working on a patch to be released.  The platforming elements in Slain are few and far between, there is a number of jumping puzzles, but none that have you re-doing the stage over and over again because you miss a ledge, each of the jumping puzzles are concluded within a minute or two leaving it a stress-free challenge. I would of liked to have seen a little more in-depth combat mechanics in game, and maybe even some sort of talent tree/unlock system through levelling up to add some additional abilities, but alas.\n\nVisually, Slain is absolutely gorgeous. The pixel graphic style hits all of the right notes and it is easily one of, if not the best pixel style game I have ever seen. The backgrounds of all of the levels are stunning and perfectly hit the mood of the game on the head. The character models of the player and enemies are all very high quality as well. The attack cycles of all of the characters animation are fluid and look amazing to see playout. The graphical department is definitely Slain!’s strongest point.\n\nSlain! is hard, a lot of timing has go into when to strike your enemy, trying to remember attack patterns of your foes will also make the combat easier to overcome too. Thankfully each level has a number of checkpoints evenly spread out across the stage meaning if you do die, you don’t have to replay the whole stage again.\n\nNow, I am not 100% sure whether I have finished the game to be completely honest. I got an ending cut scene, or so it felt like it, with a “To be continued” at the end, but looking at the achievements, I haven’t got any apart from one. I definitely haven’t defeated a giant spider; I haven’t defeated the “Mega Beholder”, Horge, or Lord Vroll. I am not sure how I fight these, and I am not sure how I go about seeing the rest of the content; is it even present in the game? I’m not sure.  For what I have played so far, and if it is the game I have finished, it only took me just under two hours. That for me is a little on the short side. Like I said, this could be a bug, with the game; I am just not sure and would welcome a response from a dev on the point.\n\nTechnically, the game is OK. I will mimic the concerns about the controller issues that people are having in that they aren’t hugely responsive at times.  Some sort of tutorial system would be welcome too, rather than being chucked into the game and being expected to know what all of the buttons do right off the bat. Slain also has an issue at points where invisible walls prevented me from progressing through the stage, when it is quite clearly the way I needed to progress - this only happened when I was trying to jump over traps though.  I was happily surprised I could play the game on 4k resolutions though which for me is a nice addition.\n\nSlain is a game that I was extremely hyped over for a number of months. I was disappointed when the game was delayed a few weeks ago, and couldn’t wait to pick it up on launch this past week. Maybe I was a little too hyped for it because I expected a lot from it. In the game’s current state I can simply recommend it for action/platformer fans as it is an interested take on the genre, hopefully the developers can clear up the technical issues and shed some light on the content that I seem to have missed. The price tag of £8,99 may be a bit too high at the moment for only 2 hours’ worth of content, so this is one to watch out for when on sale.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

I'm glad that the kickstarter allowed for whomever is responsible for it to create it. That alone makes me feel it was worth the $20 pledge.\n\nThe font that I see others comment on is okay, I don't mind it at all. However, the appearing tips are seriously aggravating. Nowhere does it actually seem to say what the controls are. So when the tip says, for example, that "spirit bomb" can clear many enemies at once, I'm left puzzled on whether that means the R1 trigger attack or something else (apparently something else, but I only learned that by reading others comments here).\n\nBased on, an admittedly very short play session, combat mechanics seem completely dysfunctional. You end up mostly mashing one button, hoping for there to be some effect on the enemy. Movement and jumping is quite responsive, so I don't think I've experienced that exact "sluggishness" I see others write about (I used a steam controller, so don't know if that had an effect on it).\nHowever, attacking is a whole different matter. Attacks themselves feel lackluster and there is hardly any feel to what you're doing or that much of a reaction from the enemy. Gameplay gets condensed to walking up to an enemy, hitting it as many times and as fast as possible, until one of you falls over. If you survive, then you move onto the next target (if not, well, you start over). Rinse and repeat.\n\nSlowing individual attacks down, adding more damage to each hit, heftier sound effects, more kickback to enemies (they could then be stronger as well) and allowing for the character to dodge after finishing an attack (or series of attacks), might do wonders to the gameplay, I reckon. Also, having more moves from the start wouldn't hurt (no idea if there will be more unlocked as the game progresses).\n\nI'll give the game another chance a bit later and will update this review, if there are any interesting revelations on gameplay mechanics.","March 24","false","0.3"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

At times, it also seems like sound effects are completely missing when a visual effect is rendered, but the SFX is mute.\n\nI didn't have many issues with the controls using a controller, it's not laggy per se, it just takes some getting used to.","March 24","false","0.5"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

The rocking metal music, which at first sounds cool, quickly loses its luster as it's looped continuously ad nauseum.  I will say I love the look of the game and the concept behind it.  The whole experience feels hollow, like a skelton for a decent game is there, but not fleshed out.\n\nI played this with a gamepad, so the controls were fine. Be warned, the game won't tell you the controls, so you'll have to figure it out on your own or look them up in the menu.\n\nThere's no sound effect for defeating enemies. Which leaves you feeling like you haven't accomplished anything.  The enemy AI is so basic that you can cheat your way to victory by exploiting their limitations.  There was a large skelton boss with a sword on a platform that was unable to move off of, that I just stood back and pelted him with projecticles.  Speaking of skeltons they can be obnixous to take down as they take several hits to defeat, and there's no skill involved so you end up mashing the attack button.\n\nMaybe with some updates and tweaks this game could become something resembling a decent game.

This game could of been something great; a castlevania-esque looking, side scrolling, badass soundtracked murder-a-thon, unfortunately it's infuriating to play. If the music had something more to it, the controls were tightened up, the enemies didn't stun block you to oblivion, the everything was balanced a little better I'd love this game; It's just disappointing overall.","April 4","false","1.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

What we got was a huge disappointment. I played some of it outside of Steam for a bit to ensure I'd have the refund option available if I chose to do so.\nFirst and foremost, the art style is beautiful. If there's one thing that this game does get right, it's the graphics (for the most part.) However, aesthetics alone aren't enough to hold this together.\nThe controls are fairly clunky and unresponsive; for a platformer, controls need to be tight. Which they aren't.\nCombat could use some help. You string together the same three-hit combo- which is fine, though the window to actiate the next attack is odd. I can't tell if the button is supposed to be pressed immediately, if there's supposed to be a delay, or what because the devs didn't exactly provide any kind of instructions on controls whatsoever. It's also hard to attack monsters at such close range without them hitting you back. But with a game that's supposed to be about butchering a bunch of monsters, attacking like an opportunist coward seems a little disappointing. There's also no cue, visual or audio, that you've been hit. Sure, don't need a sound effect, just do a red flash on the boarder. Oh wait, that's not done either. So often you may not een know you've been hit. Overall, I get what the combat was going for, but it still needs help.\nThe audio is sub-par. While the music is decent, the sound effects themselves are in serious need of help. Many of the effects are really low and are easily drowned out by the music, forcing you to turn the music down and your computer's volume up to hear anything. Even then, the sound effects themselves aren't exactly excellent quality.\n\nTo be honest, this kinda feels like something I'd find on Newgrounds in terms of quality. Sad thing is I've played better games on Newgrounds. In its current state, I can't recommend it at all.","March 24","false","0.2"," 16 of 29 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","16","29","0","0"

The addition of WASD + Mouse input has made the game playable (but has to be selected in options!) at this point.\n\nThe and developer appears to be moving towards making the combat more satisfactory and some other game play tweaks. In other words the developer appears to be listening and I can say the game is worth buying if you enjoy the look & feel of traliers I think you'll enjoy this game.\n\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\n\nSlain has potential; but they need to do at least two things to make this game playable\n\n1) You need to at least TELL US what the control options are even if you aren't going to let us map them!! I have no idea what any of the controls are on my keyboard NOR my game controller.   There's  literally no way to tell what the controls are! At one point it gives you the helpful advice "Spirit bombs are useful against crowds of enemies"  how do you do a spirit bomb?  WHO KNOWS?!\n\n2) The keyboard support is so bad I would say this game needs a warning that a game controller is recommended. As this is currently a PC game they NEED to support Mouse + keyboard theres really no reason on earth this isn't possible in a Unity 3D game these days.\n\nThe control issue is so bad that when using the keyboard the only way I know how to quit the game is hit CTR-ALT-DELETE for task manager and quit it like that.. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Is there a way to properly quit? WHO KNOWS?\n\n\nGeneral gameplay is a little unpolished, such as there's a mini boss early in the game (some kind of razor claw monster) that I have no idea how to beat , but hey no problem just walk through him and keep going...\n\nThese things can be polished over time I suppose (if they care to) but the controls need to be fixed ASAP.\n\nWill update/change review once they do so.","March 24","true","4.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","13"

There really isnt a story or any depth to the game what so ever. Very repetitve with not much variation to the game. I've gotten so bored with the game both times ive played it and quit because i was so bored with it. NOW to the controls. YES they are horrible. ONLY because of two reasons. If you try to use the keyboard, you might as well not purchase the game. If you use an xbox 360 controller the game becomes semi-playable BUT there are no instructions for the controls AT ALL. Making it almost un-playable or do said moves the game talks about in the subtitling. I would typically live with a bad game but this is a huge exception.

The soundtrack, the aesthetics, the atmosphere...it's all close to perfect. I'd actually say this is a spiritual successor to the NES metal tribute game Holy Diver, which is a similar level of badassery but was sadly limited by the possibilities of the NES.\n\nNow, I'd only have one criticism of this game - which is a big one though: it needs customisable controls.\nThe keyboard controls just don't feel intuitive to me (and I realise this was designed for a gamepad, but I'm just more used to playing on keyboard). At the very least, there should be a menu option to show a basic explanation of the controls, I've died a bunch of times before I actually figured out how to do the super move.\n\nI've also seen a lot of people complain that the controls are slow and unresponsive, but I personally think that's an artistic choice. This game is supposed to be a tribute to old games like Castlevania and Ghosts'n'Goblins, and those also have similarly slow controls - I have such fond childhood memories of raging over the sluggish controls in The Castlevania Adventure on gameboy, I'm used to this by now. It's not intolerably slow, so it passes imo.\n\nI'd recommend this because the developer said they'd fix the controls, so I'll hope that my problems with the game will be gone in the future.

Pixel perfect is a good way to describe the collision detection in this game, that is to say how close to an object you have to be before impact occurs, this is somewhat important so i would describe it as being tight in this regard so do be careful and time your jumps to perfection.\n\nControls are spot on, for reference i am playing with keyboard which uses cursor keys for control of your character and other keys for slash etc. This isn't a control system that gets used these days but something you would have seen years ago but for me this just feels very natural, didn't try gamepad controls but it's there for those who prefer it and also i didn't have any control issue's and any kind of input lag either. I will just say that keyboard bindings are not listed in the launcher/configuration and there is virtually no options ingame apart from music and sound fx volume.\n\nI won't spoil what the rest of the game has to offer as that should be for you to discover but there are some great little features and surprises in store.\n\nPlus points\n\nMetal soundtrack\nPixel art graphics (amazing really)\nSlick controls\nGreat difficulty\n\nNegative points\n\nLack of options\nSome achievements are currently bugged\n\nJust to sum up would i recommend this game? Yes i certainly do especially if you love and remember classic action platformers but do bear in mind that it's a challenging game too so if that's your thing then you could do a lot worse than giving Slain a shot and i rate it 8.9/10.\n\nFor reference i purchased this game myself and didn't receive a free key from the developer or publisher and in no way related to them, thanks for reading and hope that you all enjoy your experience.","March 24","true","4.1"," 20 of 40 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","20","40","0","8"

I love the art style and the soundtrack is great.\n\nIf you enjoy classic inspired games, don't mind dying a few hundred times, and like metal you need this game in your library.\n\nDon't let negative comments about "unresponsive controls" influence your decision.

But when the game is set to "fastest" in the graphics options, the controls are very responsive, and the game doesn't look much different from the top graphics option.  Runs awesome with the Steam Controller under Linux! Which is a huge positive for me; no tux no bucks.\n\nIf you're a fan of the original Castlevania, this is basically Castlevania with checkpoints. Totally worth it at the price point they're selling the game for. Definitely very difficult, in a cheap NES sense, but that's part of the fun.\n\nI would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys retro action-platformers.\n\nDay-one purchase, I've had this on my wishlist for quite a while, and I don't regret the purchase  at all. If you're a fan of Shovel Knight and Super Meat Boy, than this game is a good compliment to round out your collection of neo-NES-styled games.","March 24","true","1.2"," 21 of 43 people (49%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","49","21","43","2","0"

Somehow I expected to pay double the price and get double the game, so it comes of as a little disappointing.\n\nGuess the idea was to recreate the classics of old - Shadow of the Beast 1 comes to mind here: Slightly atrocious controls, zero attack variation, great graphics and flair.\n\nThe visuals are basically what sold the game to me. If you like what you see, it'll probably be worth the price - just do not expect a marvel of game design. Also it feels a little unpolished right now, but that might change with future updates.\n\n+Scenery: It's probably what you came here for. Spot on.\n+Enemies: Lacking variation, but what's there looks deliciously gruesome.\n-Frustration: Difficulty relies heavily on the unfabulous duo of sparse checkpoints and poor collision.\n-Simplicity: Wish it had been more than just a looker.","March 25","true","9.5"," 13 of 27 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","13","27","0","0"

I guess I didn't have huge expectations.....1st i'm a big 2d scrolling platformer fan. I have been playing games like Castlevania and Metroid for years. The artwork in this game is awesome. I see it has been made with the  UNITY Engine and with the pixel and high rez graphics combo it creates a very gory looking world.\n\nAs far as the sound goes I have no troubles at my end. I have set the music for 7 and the SFX set for 10 seems to be the perfect settings. The controls seem just right! I use an Xbox 360 wireless controller. It took me a bit to learn when to backup and jump, slash and time my projectile hitting. I guess being in my 50's have given me the GRIT to learn and proceed!! Haha.\n\nThe Devs sound very involved so far but it is early yet!? Nothing worse then trying to please everyone all at once. My guess a few of them will be poached by some big game developer and the game will die off. (hope that doesn't happen)\n\nThere are small problems with the menu as it delays at times when you press a button or move your stick but that is only in the menu at my end. I would like too see a more robust INTRO and a little back story....no big deal!\n\nSo far I like it a lot and look forward to the improvements....Keep up the good work devs but also get some rest and go at it strong. 8/10\n\nMAY 14/2016\nUPDATE\n\nSlain! has just received a PATCH! It is much better now...movement is better and sound and music is better....the game saves properly now and it is SO MUCH better to play!! Thank you DEV!\n\n\nMAY 30/2016\nUPDATE 1.25\n\nAnother update...controller problem seems fixed....they added a "NEW" level....this game is so close to being "GREAT" as promised! It is so much fun now....thank you again guys!! Keep up the good work!!","March 25","true","1.6"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","9","19","0","0"

The art for the environment and enemies is all top-notch imo.  At times the grunginess of it all can make traps, etc hard to see, but overall - beautifully done!\n- OST is metal and adds a lot to the experience (albeit a bit repetitive in the guitar riff dept)  There are times where I feel the music is marred by the distortion.  Mainly because I'm not a fan of the tone - it's a bit dry and high on treble.  It overpowers the rest of the music.  Just my opinion, either way, well done and it certainly fits!\n- I love the overall theme.  Feels like it was ripped from a death or black metal album.\n\nThings IMO that could improve with patching, etc:\n- SFX are weak!  This game could really use some decent SFX - they're not terrible atm, but I would've loved to have just stopped in the middle of a level and bask in the ambience of evil winds blowing through the trees, far-off screaming, or when you hit something, you really hear it, which brings me to the next point...\n- JUICE.  For a game where everything is in your face, when I hit or kill something, I want to FEEL it.  A little screenshake and more meaty SFX for hits and kills would go a long way in improving the experience.\n- Enemies either get knocked back or stay put and chop when you hit them.  I don't see any consistant pattern, so it's a bit difficult to be strategic with some encounters.  Hit timing, knock-back, etc could be tightened up some more.\n\nOverall, at this time, I would recommend it to fans of sidecsrolling action games who are looking to scratch that nolstalgia itch with something new.  I hope the developers take some of the player feedback and implement any suggestions they find worthy.  If they do, then the game would be definitely be better for it!\n\n\m/ >< \m/","March 25","true","1.7"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

Slain.\n\nI read about it on Kotaku and became interested with promises of heavy metal and side-scrolled hack n' slash and was not let down. Feels a bit like someone was looking for ideas for their first game and used inspiration from a local metal band as a basis and I would not be at all surpsied if we see the OST from the game released with a name which is made up of two words: One vaguely metal and the other word being "blood".\n\nI played it for 8 minutes which got me through the first boss and two levels which took me to the overworld. It plays a lot like a "smoother" Castlevania(Super Castlevania?) which isn't a bad thing! It has tight controls, fun graphics, plays great, the enemies are easy to take down if you're careful, and lots of insta-deaths from falls and traps! What it doesn't have is even a vaguely-decent story and the text all looks like it was texted to someone who uses Twitter a lot.\n\nTo summarize:\n\nI love this game. I'd buy the album.

When I started, the intro gave a feeling of i'm the hero and i've done this before. As you progress you notice so much being put infront of you. For a platform, its usual as in most platformers give you a hard sistuation to get a feel for whats comming up ahead. Slain! did this perfictly. You quickly discover the visuals of traps and learn the que's for when or when not to attack. If you use a controller, "as do I'  you probably spamed the joy stick and attack bottons. I personally deduced most of the uses for most of the attacks, from watching the trailer, form just messing around ingame. The graphis are beyond what I was expecting. the main menu was a shock to start but in game blew me away."I am playing on 1920/1080 and fantistic"  The atmosphere of the levels all most perficltly match all the songs along with the visual aesthetics.\n\nI highly recommend this game to all who are seeking a well made platformer. The vibe the game gives matches all the effects given to player. yes the controls might not be easy to figure out, but when you do the game just gets better.","March 25","true","4.5"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

If I'm swinging a giant sword then there should feel like there's some impact to it.\nThat's just the issue with the asthetics. The practical reason is that there should be a rhythm to the game play rather than button mashing and hoping that the weapon knockback is enough to halt the enemies' advance. Some enemies shouldn't meant to be halted, so the other part is having the attack range longe enough to hit and then have room to dodge backwards. And then the dodge needs to cover a sufficient enough distance to be able to repeat this process.\nAll of this with a slight input delay makes the combat annoying. I can deal with it, but it's not versatile enough for me to have fun jumping and dodging and hacking my way around the screen.\n\nA tutorial section of the game would be helpful to teach about blocking and how the mechanics of the game work.\n\nAlso the special attack to kill everything (down and one of the attack buttons) is a bad way to map it as I'll be ducking in combat to block projectiles and then can accidently hit the attack button when I immediately want to follow through with an attack which will trigger the special attack and waste all of my mana.\n\n\nHowever, the art and music of the game is that brilliant that I'm not getting a refund and will wait for patches.\nDespite the shortcomings, even if the game was never patched the game is certainly worth the price tag.","March 24","true","1.0"," 30 of 63 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","30","63","0","0"

Reminds me of games I played as a kid.  Games like Rastan, Karnov, Altered Beast, Ghouls n' Ghosts, Castlevania games, and even more recently Volgarr the Viking.\nIt's not a game with a deep story or lots of depth.  It's a hack and slash side scrolling platform game.  It has some great artwork and nice music.  Although there are areas of the game where I think they could do more with the sound effects.\nI love how the game doesn't hand you things on a silver platter.  There is no tutorial that explains every single move and function in the game.  It gives you a hint or suggestion and the player is left to figure it out on their own.  The controls are pretty basic as is so it's not a problem, and it's fun when you figure out a new move.  I hit this button + this button and tada  you guys figured one out.\nI plugged in an old 360 controller and immediately felt at home playing the game and comfortable.

Expecting to find a game full of great visuals and music but not much else. I was very very wrong. I don't know what people are playing on, if they are playing earlier builds, etc. But I had no problem playing this game and think it is a fantastic ride.\n\nLet me first say, if you are playing this on keyboard, I have no advice. Please buy a gamepad as that is obviously how its intended to be played. I tried this on both a wired 360 controller as well as an NES USB controller and both worked great. If you were a fan of the NES Castlevania games, then you will immediately understand this game. None, and I mean, NONE of the controls are a problem. They are just the like the whip in Castlevania, there is a slight delay between the button press and the execution of the swing, you need to use strategy. This is not Cave Story or Dishwasher Samurai. The combat is not combo driven or twitchy. This is about taking time, learning, and dying alot. This is old school.\n\nI have never written a review for a game on Steam. I just had to chime in when I saw the plethora of negative reviews and felt they were either being unfair or expecting something from the game that I wasn't.\n\nSome people want more explained in the controls/tutorial. I, for one, applaud the lack of it. Remember experimenting with different buttons and attacks to figure things out? That's what you do here. By the end of the first stage, I had learned everything...and I believe that was the original intent.\n\nSo in conclusion, I don't want to say other people are wrong. They bought the game and are entitled to their opinion. But I just wanted to supply another point of view. This game is fantastic and I really can't wait to die alot more in the coming levels. OH, also never had a pause or quitting problem...pressing start on the controller, then exit...worked fine for me...","March 26","true","1.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","2","0","0"

The only way you can get a game that looks better than this one is to go play Castlevania Symphony Of The Night. There is a ton of detail in the foreground and the background going on that is really amazing.\n\nSound\n\nThe metal sound track that goes with this game is great.  There's really not much else I can say.  Some people said they find it a bit repetitive but I don't find that that be the case.  I suppose you can always turn the sound off and fire up something else to play to it.\n\nControls\n\nCertainly I agree with some of what has been said already\n\n1)Tutorial: The game could stand to have an in game as you go tutorial on what buttons to do what, and how to use the powers you collect.  Apotheon does a good job of this, so does Axiom Verge.  This isn't a huge demerit for the game, but it certainly would make the game play more fluid and enjoyable.\n\n2) Complains about Input delay:  To be honest I haven't had any.  I use a PS style USB controller to play most platform games or side scrollers.  The game reacts perfectly fine to my controller inputs.  I haven't tried using a keyboard so there may still be a issue there.\n\n3)Mapping Keys:  This is probably my biggest gripe about the game.  While the the USB controller I have works fine, it would be great to be able to map the buttons IN GAME.  There is an option to do some mapping  before the game starts but it's pretty nebulous and i'm pretty sure its only for the d-pad/analog stick motions.","March 26","true","1.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I've been looking forward to this game for a while now and in the first half hour, I was having a great time. The art is amazing, the music gets me ready for a gruesome adventure and the archaic setting is right up my alley.\n\nI played and played, died and died and progessed further and further with each try. And after about an hour, I finished the first level. At this time I was thinking, "wow, that first level was extremely hard". But as I progressed further into the game, I realized that it's not challenging for the right reasons.\n\nMy constant deaths were not due to mistakes on my part. I would try something new each time. And I've given both of the first two levels PLENTY of tries. Here are the problems with the game (in its current state) that I see so far:\n\n- The character doesn't always hit in combos like he should when I'm mashing the hit button.\n\n- When I hit the dash back button, it doesn't interrupt the player attack animation, which causes the enemy to hit me before I can dash. The dash NEEDS to interrupt the attack animation to get rid of the unresponsive feeling of that specific mechanic.\n\n- Each battle basically consists of hitting enemies while they hit you (partly due to not being able to dash properly). It's almost impossible to get through a fight without losing health or exploiting the game. (Getting enemies on a ledge so they can't hit you). This causes me to lose health with almost every single enemy encounter. Which leads to my next problem.\n\n- The hearts. You regain health by hitting things that resemble tombstones. The heart then pops out and start floating away. Sometimes when the heart starts to float away, I can't jump due to me swinging at the tombstone. The heart gets away and I've learned that if you go into a battle without a lot of health, you die. So at this point, I restart at the checkpoint because I KNOW that I'll die.  "Repeated failure is a predictable cycle, and rather boring." - Raph Koster.\n\n- Another problem with the health regen system is where they are located. Most of these tombstones are located right above enemy spawning points. So since I have little health left from my last battle. It's nearly impossible for me to collect this next heart because I dont have enough health to kill the enemies surround it.\n\n- The last problem I have is with the enemies stacking on stop of eachother. I know it's kind of wierd for enemies to "wait in a line to attack you", but when they're stacked up, you lose SO much health when you're fighting because there are times when A LOT of enemies are thrown at you.\n\nAs a game dev myself, I respect the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game. It's awesome and has SOOO much potential to be great and I have faith that the devs are going to make it so. So my recommendation is subject to the tweaks, fixes and optimization.","March 26","true","2.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I purchased Slain expecting a (Gorgeous) sluggish sloppy mess that was going to be hopefully patched in the near term to address the major shortcomings in the gameplay.  I have been following this game for a long time, and the dev's seem to be very engaged and genuinely desire to provide the best product they can, so I decided what the hell - I'll give em the chance.  It sounds like perhaps there are some optimization issues that at the time of me writing this need to be resolved for some folks, but the devs are already looking into it.  Anyhow, I saw none of this.  Instead of a 12 buck gamble on a future quality product though, I was pleased to discover a very enjoyable game right out of the box!  I'm running on a i7, 16 gb ram with 2x 770gtx cards, and Im using an xbox 360 controller like a filthy console peasant would.  I have not tried with a keyboard but with that said, I have played the game on max graphics quality and it handled exactly like I hoped it would.  Volgar the Viking or old school early Castlevania games would be the best approximation of gameplay that I can think of.  Perhaps the old Blackthorne game from Blizzard?  These are all good things - they were all fun games!  The controls are simple, and the combo chaining crowd will likely be confused by the fairly straight forward approach, but that's the point - this is an homage to the classic 16 bit side scroller, and they were all about making the most of pretty basic gameplay.  The game is challenging, but the ballance is well done - some fights are intended to beat you to a pulp but if you play smart you will live through it  there is always a health pickup to keep you going.  The pace is good, and if you keep your cool, you will do just fine.   This game is dripping with atmosphere.  The graphics are absolutely stunning - some of the finest pixel art I have ever seen, channeling the very best of the 16 bit consol era along with the glory or the old VGA pentium days of platform gaming.  Every screencap is art.  The atmosphere is augmented by fantastic music and flavor narrative that complete the dark, Gothic environment and works on the same vibes that made Diablo or Symphony of the Night so engrossing.    This game by my observation is damned good.  It does what its supposed to do, and it does it well.  I don't understand where the negative posts came from, though they may well have valid points - what works on one computer may not work on another.  That said, from my own experience, this was exactly what I wanted.","March 26","true","10.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It's difficult, the controls are stiff and require precision & timing, and there's little in the way of explaining the game's mechanics. All of this seems to have been by design. You're definitely going to want to play this with a gamepad. If you're an oldschool Castlevania veteran you should feel right at home here but if you're expecting a more forgiving action-platformer or a Metroidvania you'll find yourself initially frustrated and possibly disappointed. There are some rough edges here in terms of presentation: sound effects v background music, minor performance issues, occassional crashes. These will likely get smoothed out in time. As mentioned by everyone, the aesthetic of the game is fantastic with great attention to detail. It's more Castlevania than Castlevania with gothic horror on display everywhere. The soundtrack is excellent and totally appropriate. Bottom line: if you love the original Castlevania or Castlevania 3 or if you're a fan of classic hard arcade-y NES titles (e.g., Ninja Gaiden) you should grab this. If you're more interested in exploration over platform puzzles this isn't really for you. If you're expecting inventory management & leveling up over tough action requiring persistence and precision then maybe this isn't the title for you.","March 26","true","3.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The game is great. It has a nice heavy metal theme throughout the game and soundtrack, the visual are beautiful for what they are intended (it's ment to look old and blocky). If your into metal, sidescrollers or want that nostalgice old school feeling then you'll like this.\n\nTo address the cons of the game. like so many have stated the controls are lagging and a bit odd. Thats on keyboard though, If you have a controller then the game is fine but beware, there is no tutorial in the game. The first level is ment to teach you the controls through chat windows that pop up throughout the stage but they go by so fast and the window sort of blends into the area that you miss what it says, it also doesn't tell you Button A does this, Button B does that. It really just tells you of Bathoryn's abilities.\n\nBut I don't believe thats reason enough to give this game a negative review as a patch is about to resolve the control issues, and the game dev posted a picture of the controller skeme on the community hub so we have everything to fix the cons of this game.","March 26","true","2.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I hope the rougher issues (steam achievements not unlocking included)  get ironed out and this game gets more love. I found it challenging, but not so much that I raged and quit. It brought me back to my NES days, pushing myself further. The "END" of the game is also a little disappointing (won't ruin it here). Sadly, the price also feels a little high for the amount of time it took me to complete. IF YOU enjoy more classical platforming/hack and slash games reminiscent of Castlevania series and the like, I suggest you give this game a go. A gamepad is also the way to go with this one.

Controls are simple, but strategic: you have a 3 hit combo, a slight backwards dash, a jump (you can attack during your jump), a ranged magic attack (can be cast midair), and what looks like a backhanded slash.  Others have complained of input lag, but I didn't feel any per se, I felt like my button presses were in time with the animations - which is maybe less responsive than some would have wanted, but felt very natural to me.  One point where I think the creators of the game may have "suckered" some people is there isn't an ability to animation cancel: if you're in the middle of an attack and someone swings faster than you, you can't dodge or jump.  This was frustrating the first two or three times it happened to me until I realized it was intentional: you can't just bull your way through some areas and you need to actually use some strategy.  The only part of the controls I'm not particularly fond of is the backhanded slash, which doesn't actually appear to do much: it's less useful than your normal attack, it's shorter ranged, and it doesn't seem to do more damage.  It looks cool, but it doesn't appear to have a use.  I'm not very far though, so maybe it's some sort of required execution for bosses or something.\n\nAnimation is gorgeous; there's tons to look at.  I wish it was a little better defined, but it feels like somewhere between an 8 bit Castlevania and a 16 bit one.  I know that's a weird middle ground, but it feels very appropriate.  Music is a bit repetitive - I didn't mind it as much as some other people seemed to, but I did mind that it was very LOUD and the settings were either LOUD or almost muted.  I ultimately turned it down to hear the ambient noise and found it more pleasant and helpful.\n\nDifficulty level seemed to be about what I expected from a game that seems to pay homage to 8/16 bit classic Castlevania platformers: it's not particularly forgiving, but it's also not particularly difficult, either, with tons of health and mana vials to be found easily.\n\nOverall, I'm recommending this *with caveats*; I think with a couple good patches, some of the day one issues will be cleared up (like that weird input lag in the menu and the music issues) and it'll be a lot better.  It reminded me a lot of Volgarr the Viking, albeit much easier.  I'm super happy it works with my Steam Controller without having to fiddle with it too much.  I also haven't found it to be much of a Metroidvania (yet); it honestly plays like an original Castlevania title from the NES - that's not a knock at all, but if you were expecting a large map with back tracking and finding new powers, I can't say that I've seen anything to that effect (yet).","March 24","true","0.4"," 11 of 25 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","11","25","0","0"

Also you have to configure the game for your controller. By default it uses the left analog stick for overall control. From menu navigation to in game movement. I rather use my D-Pad.

No explanation of the controls.\nThe game tells you early on that "Spirit Bombs" are a great way of clearing out large hordes of enemies. How do you "Spirit Bomb"? HINT: Have Twitch chat buddies with Google :^)\n\n2. Ridiculous stunlock when an enemy attacks you.\nNot normally a problem in Castlevaniaesque titles, however, in those games you get whats known as "knockback" which safely (in most instances) knocks you backwards out of harms way. Not so in Slain! where you get locked in place and promptly surrounded and killed within seconds. Enemies do NOT suffer this stunlock effect however and oftentimes with attack straight through your attack\n\n3. The swordplay.\nFor some reason I find it to seem quite janky.  A basic combo system would suffice here e.g 3 vertical slashes into a horizontal slash for the decapitation.\n\n4.  Audio.\nSFX are way too quite or just not there at all. Not really much else negative with regards to this subject.\n\n5.  The backstep.\nNow I thought that using this properly would help negate a lot of damage I was receiving. Unfortunately, it is kind of broken. Replace this with a dodgeroll and we are golden ;)\n\nThe story I havent paid attention to :^)\nFrom what I can gather, you are some kind of warrior trying to kill the big bad guy after being woken up by some ghost lady. Unfortunately, the text is hard to read and disappears quite quickly. Not too much of an issue that makes it deserving of going into the above mentioned negative are of this review\n\nGameplay\nThis is essentially Castlevania with more headbanging and windmilling. Gore everywhere, big enemies, lots of smaller ones and some platforming sections thrown into the mix. The game can get quite difficult but for all the wrong reasons. Stunlock being the main culprit of 99% of my deaths so far\n\nVisuals\nIts like a full motion Slayer album cover. The character animations and enemy design are amazing, with beatifully flowing movements bar a few enemies that have a stop-motion feel to them. Anyone who has played "The Deadly Tower of Monsters" will know what I mean. Think "Jason and the Argonauts" style animation.\nAside from that tiny negative, the game looks and animates beautifully.\n\nAudio\nHit and miss for the most part. Music is great but the point where the music loops needs some work. It just stops.....then goes back into the track again. SFX need to be patched as well as some of them just flat out arent there. An audio cue when you take damage wouldnt go amiss devs ;)\n\nClosing\nA few hiccups here and there mar what could have been an amazing launch. The issues I mentioned above arent enough to make this a "Do not buy" by any means but may hinder your enjoyment until you adjust to them. Hopefully this will be patched up. Im going to plough through this, issues and all, due to my love for Castlevania style games.\n\nOverall, I recommend this IF you have the ability to look through the issues I stated above\n\nFrom what I can gather, this is the devs first game. Techincal issues are to be expected and all the negativity is unjust. Help them guys. Feedback, negative or otherwise. Saying the game is "garbage" and requesting refunds isnt going to help them and will only make them less likely to make games in the future.","March 25","true","5.3"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

(This might be a tad bit arrogent)\n\nSo I like this game and here is why:\n1. I like the difficulty with the game\n2. I like the old school feel to it\n3. There is a learning curve to the game and it rewards you for learning\n\nSo lets delve into this:\nA. Graphics\nB. Game Play\nC. Music\nD. Controls\n\nGraphics:\nExcellent graphics. It brings back memories of Ghost and Gobblins and the 8 bit era. Very metal, very metal. The only complaint is that some of the traps blend in very easily into the environment, although that may be the intent of the developers.\n\nGame Play:\nYou have access to quite a few things that make the game interesting. To discover them is part of the game, and the game was meant to relive some of the old style hype. So if you discover the flame sword fairly early on and then die, then can you re-equip it? or is it gone forever? (HINT: LOOK AT THE CONTROL SECTION). You have access to three primary attacks with one screen wipe: Regular slash, beheading slash, range magic attack, and magic bomb. With the other two unlock weapons or so, you get different effects with each of the slashes. For example, the flame sword is faster and moves you further across the screen, while the ice axe will throw enemies quite a distance from you.\nThere is an indicator for everything, but you would have to figure out what it means, and I will make a beginners guide on what each one means. For example, why do enemies have a red line around their necks? or why is there blood all over that patch of ground that the surrounding area lacks?\nEach enemy has a clear pattern and a clear counter play to them and some have counter play to alternative attacks. (HINT: DO NOT BOMB THE BIG RED SKELETONS) so the frustation there is that the patterns will change as you unlock more weapons. But I like a game that evolves with you.\n\nMusic:\nI like the chords that are playing in the background. Yeah the repeat every so often, and so times they cover up sound clues to what you need to do next. Aside from that, you can control the music from the pause menu. If you don't like metal chords, then play with no sound.\n\nControls:\nThis seems to be the biggest complaint of the game. However, I disagree with those complaints. Before the game loads, a white box shows up and you can change the controls from there. The controls are as follows for those that do not have a joy stick or game pad:\narrow keys for move left, move right, jump and block (which is down)\nQ for quick slash\nW for beheading slash\n1 for range magic attack\n2 for normal sword\n3 for flame sword\n4 for ice axe\np for pause\nenter for continue or navigating the menu's\nNow for some of that good old explaination for how the controls work:\nYour momentum is controlled by a few things: how long you are holding the key, and whether or not you have taken damage. Damage stops your momentum, so a couple of parts are hard because of a range enemy on the other side of a pit. That was fun to figure out.\nThe platforms that are solid are solid through and through. That means if you try to jump to another platform from underneath, you will bonk your head and lose some of your momentum.\nEach weapon has a plus and a minus to how it works:\nNormal weapon is a basic no bonus and no minus tool. The downside is that other weapons will handle situations better and you will take damage from enemies, because this things has a very small stun lock.\nRange magic is good for dealing with weak enemies that you are having some trouble reaching. It consumes a small amount of mana, but with a full bar you can maybe fire it off about 10 times.\nFlame sword is good agains witches. It is faster and deals less damage, while moving you farther with each attack.\nIce axe is good against most creatures, but terrible against witches. Each swing has a big stun time and the final swing in a normal combo knocks an enemy back far enough for you to reset and move.\n\nTLDR:\nThe game's difficulty comes from not giving you any sort of tutorial to learn anything. It expects you to 1. be patient and not click, click through the game. 2. pay attention and try different combo's to advance. 3. finally focus on how each enemy fights. This game is a departure from the normal here is the first level, now we will walk you through the tutorial before letting you go HAM. Be patient and you will eventually make it through.","March 27","true","5.7"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","3","0","0"

So I buy that and I'll be damned if something new didn't come out, 10% off and something I read about but not on my wishlist! Well...at least I have something to play while being broke!\n\nNow...onto Slain.\n\nI am not sure what the gripes are all about, the game seems to play just like an old school 8 bit game. In those days, there was no such thing as "Fair" controls were something you had to learn how they worked and how YOU could play the game. Often with little or no instruction. We played and we learned to be good gamers.\n\nToday it seems like there are so many complaints over really nothing... I agree if a game is broken, but this game to me is not. I loaded it, turned on my gamepad and started playing. I had read after purchasing so many bad reviews, I cringed...had I wasted 12.00? Nope. IT IS OLD SCHOOL GAMING AT IT'S BEST!\nGo back and look at Yars revenge or Night driver...se what we had to work with. Did we have fun? Hell Yeah! Are games better now? Absolutely. There is a place for every style and type. Just remembre, 8 bit isn't a catchphrase or some kind of art style... it is the early life of video games...\n\nAnyway, to each their own. The game may not be everyones cup of tea but I really like it. I know I only have 12 minutes in the game at this point, but if I wind up being wrong, i'll eat my review and update it.\n\nMeanwhile, drop your expectation and play. It is a lot of fun.\n\nStephen","March 27","true","0.2"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/recommended/369070/","Humanure","Belphegore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/","1597 products in account","After only playing for 25 minutes, I feel compelled to write a review due to all of the negative ones that I've read on here. The top negative reviews that I've seen complain primarily about not being told the controls in the game, not being able to exit the game, and their game not saving. I feel that 95% of the top reviews come from people who have never picked up a game in their life as they're illegitimate complaints, and I have experienced none of these issues. Yes, it is true that the game doesn't spoon feed you by giving you the controls, but they're not that hard to figure out; jump, light attack, heavy attack, spellcast, backdash. You exit the game by pausing it with the start button and pressing "exit". My game also saved just fine. Now, on with a REAL review.\n\nSlain! is a brand new, heavy metal inspired game that can loosely be classified as a Metroidvania; though as far as I have experienced, there is little in the way of exploration, and the game primarily focuses on platforming with a heavy dose of hack n' slash. You are Bathoryn (great tribute to an all-time metal legend, by the way, props) who is risen from his grave by an unknown spirit. Your primary objective is to save the lands from onslaughts of ghoulish monsters. From the very start of the game, the dialogue exchange between Bathoryn and the entity is very sarcastic, and mildly funny. Bathoryn does not want to be risen, he prefers to lay dormant and be left alone; too bad, however, there are demons to be slain!\n\nThe pixel graphics are dark, gritty, and filled with all things that us metal heads love; blood, guts, gore, sharp pointy things, bones, skeletons, horns, demons, spirits, blood moons, fog, you name it and it's there. Although Slain! has an overall Castlevania vibe to it, the game is uniquely its own in both art direction, sound, and play style. The vibrant, complimentary colors boldly stand out from level to level; neon greens clashing with deep blues,  foresty greens fighting with pinks and oranges, cold blues combating rich blood reds, the game is every art lovers dream, especially those like myself who appreciate the utilization of colors to make backgrounds come to life. The sprites, especially bosses and larger enemies, are gory and complex in their detail, while smaller sprites such as skeletons are somewhat lackluster.\n\nWhen it comes to the soundtrack, Slain! enters an entirely new level of appeal to metal head; headbanging tunes rock the stage from the moment the title is booted up, until you exit, they don't even stop at the pause screen. Not to mention, it should be good, the entire score was done by Curt Victor FREAKIN' Bryant; if you don't know who Celtic Frost is, then you have no business owning this game, really, as it will not be for you. Each level and area within the levels have their own songs, and are usually made up of heavily distorted guitars that show off some excellent fretwork compositions and techniques; such as palm muting and pinch harmonics. If you're into metal, I'd classify the soundtrack as a mixture between thrash and death metal, although I expect there to be some doom inspiration somewhere, as dark as the game is. There's also a reference early on into the game to Bathory's album Fire and Ice, which I greatly appreciated; it's an amazing album, after all. The only complaint that can be made here is that if you get stuck in an area, the music tends to start a 10-30 second loop that can get rather boring if you fail to move on for more than a few minutes.\n\nThe absolute primary issue that I have with this title currently is how easy it is, although presenting itself as a challenging game. Some other reviews talk about how you have to conjure combos in order to move forward, rather than button mash, but this is not true; most enemies can have their attacks stopped by pressing the light attack button repetitively, this so far does not include bosses. However, the only boss that I've gotten to thus far was incredibly easy to beat as well, and his AI was very, very bad. All of these complaints are easily patchable, and I look forward to a future update that will hopefully address some of these concerns; even if not, it's not a huge issue.\n\nSo there you have it, a review written by a metal head, for a game that's intended for metal heads. In all sincerity, beware the negative reviews. I will say that the keyboard controls are shotty, but I cannot wrap my head around who would bother to play a Metroidvania style game with a keyboard in this day and age anyway. For those complaining about remapping, you may want to invest in a little thing called XPadder. Slain! is an excellent title, with amazing art and an equally captivating soundtrack, all wrapped up in the things that metal heads love and adore. I'm greatly looking forward to unravelling the story and exploring the levels further.\n\nRating: 4.0/5.0","March 25","true","1.2"," 10 of 28 people (36%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","36","10","28","2","4"

Also, as far as I've made it, there seems to be no real explanations for the mana system other than decaps to fill it.

Played for 15 mins, all the other reviews are right, controls slightly unresponsive, can't remap them. No way to find out what the controls are other than pushing every button on my keyboard to see if something happens. Press escape to quit, nothing happens, have to alt-tab out. Game looks great, sounds great in the short time I spent with it.\n\nSaw the devs post, that they are aware of the shortcomings and say they are committed to making it a great experience. Here are my suggesstions for devs:\n\n1. when I push a button to move the guy, make him move with out any little delay.\n\n2. allow me to change my keyboard layout to whatever the hell I want it to be.\n\n3. when I push down to block, make it block, everything.\n\n4. don't have the guy step forward into enemies when he attacks, it doesn't make it challenging in a fun way, it makes it challenging in a clumsy, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ way.\n\n5. just tell me what the controls are, the idea that you thought it would be fun for the player to figure them out himself is misguided at best. All it does is make me have to stop and push every button on my keyboard to see what happens.\n\nDevs, the bones are there, this could be amazing, it's still early in the release, pay attention to all your players suggestions and you still have the chance to do good. Don't overthink the changes, listen to the players, keep it simple, profit.\n\nAs it is, I can't recommend that someone else buy this, but I hope to change this review in the next couple days, after a brilliant update.","March 26","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This only reflects the first level of the game:\n\nThe game's combat is kinda....crap. Against weak enemies you can just mash the attack button and stun lock them into oblivion. For tougher enemies with more health, you can either spam your magic attach (which is rightly limited to avoid abuse) or trap them on a ledge to easily beat them without risking health (enemies can't jump and will only attack if you're right next to them).\n\nI'd normally feel bad about that, but the combat just feels so slow. Trying to mash against a boss just starts a slap fight you're doomed to lose, so this is one where you must master the art of the jump slash - which is much faster and allows you to keep moving.\n\nThere is a backdash function which appears to exist to make combat more deliberate and complex, but enemies' attacks always seem to begin before your attack animation ends, so you're better off with the jump slash. (Maybe allow the backdash to cancel current attacks to make dodging more fluid?)\n\nThe music is ....fine. Honestly, metal can be cool, but, stretched over long periods with no vocals and incessant repetition, I, personally, couldn't stand it. After truning off the music, the game took a different tone. Instead of listening to thrashing power chords, I heard the dripping of blood and...not much else. The sound design relies pretty heavily on the idea that everything will just be drowned out by the music so not much actually has a sound effect.\n\nThe biggest complaint I have with the game, though, is the platforming. I did not think going in that this game would have such a strong platofmer component to it. Certainly, I figured I would run and jump to various challenges, but the first level basically plays out like:\n\nMash to kill an enemy,\njump over moving platorms moving up and down\njump over insta-kill trap\njump over moving platorms moving up and down\nmash to kill an enemy\njump over moving platforms moving up and down\njump over insta-kill trap\njump over moving platforms moving up and down\n\n\nTo put it bluntly, the level design for the first level is somewhat tedious with a lot traps and pits that will kill you instantly - forcing you to restart from your last checkpoint, and, with such slow, limited movement, it doesn't feel engaging, or satisfying, to keep jump slashing my way through ghosts just to get across the same set of 4 moving platforms I know I've seen at least 3 times before.\n\n\nI like this game - I like action adventure games with fast combat and striking visuals - this game....tries at that.\nI'll keep my copy and continue playing to see how it goes (toggling the music as I go to give it a listen), but, so far, its in dire need of polish.","March 25","false","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

I have no doubt the developers will be patching in fixes that will improve the playability and I love the pixel art and soundtrack (even if it does get a tad repetitive). Bottom line: Is it worth $12? At this point if you plan on using a gamepad, then yes.\n\nRevision: 3/31/16\n\nThis was initially a positive review but the more issues I come across (broken achievements, bad dialogue, weightless combat and cheap deaths) I can't honestly recommend this until more work is done.

I have to take back my review, and rewrite it without nostalgia glassess on, as this game is not what it appears to be. It's awful.\n\nI will commit to saying this game is brutal. The art itself is very well done, however the story is atrocious as it is compiled by terrible writing, not including typos, for example “there are definately wolves in this forest.”\n\nIt gets worse, as even some bosses with use drivel that you would see in a teenager’s text messages “WTF”.\n\nMoving beyond the terrible writing, the combat becomes repetitive, and because of the extreme difficulty level the game sets as a standard, the slow-swinging hero Bathoryn has a hard time of dispatching enemies.\n\nEven after being able to shapeshift into a wolf, the game is so unforgiving that at times it almost seems capricious with enemy locations and traps instant killing you.\n\nCheckpoints are somewhat frequent but that does not make up for this half-♥♥♥♥♥ mess that takes inspiration from Castlevania Symphony of the Night and Rondo of Blood.\n\nThe protagonist isn’t as fast as you would expect from Alucard, nor is he nearly as quick with his attacks. I understand the developer wanted this heavy metal theme for the game, but the keyboard mapping is questionable at best. There is even a dedicated keystroke for decapitating enemies… which only regenerates mana.\n\nYou start the game waking up in a tomb, and there is no tutorial.\n\nThis game has so much potential, it is squandered on poor development. If the developers invested more time, they could have implemented RPG elements, and a bigger weapon variety, maybe even armor.\n\nAvoid this game like the plague, and just enjoy the art that you can do a simple search for. Otherwise, after having played this game for longer than I would have liked, I wish I had a physical copy to destroy while listening to Behemoth and send it to the developer.\n\nThis game is shameful to even compare to SOTN, or Rondo of Blood (both of which are both better choices than this joke).","March 27","false","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They also did away with the decapatation button and programmed a dedicated block button which has made combat feel a lot more dynamic.  Also if you time a block correctly you'll counter with a super attack which feels very satisfying.  I really like that new feature!!\n\n- Some good new music has been added to an already awesome soundtrack\n\n- Sound effects seem to be clearer and crisper\n\n- The game is now fun to play, my latest slew of deaths didn't feel cheap or leave me frustrated and confused.\n\n-The visual style is still awesome.\n\nThe game still has some quirks but it's literally night vs day concerning playing in it's state now versus when it was launched.  The developers also seem very committed to continue adding patches and improvements which the ones currently added have vastly improved the game since launch.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor context I left my original take on the game from time of purchase at launch:\n\nThese are my impressions of Slain! Hopefully viewed as constructive critism.  I experienced some frustration that has taken me away from enjoying the game.  I do think with some improvement though this title still has the potential to be fantastic.\n\nThough here are my current thoughts of the game as it stands during the writing of this:\n\nPros:\n- Amazing visual style and animation\n- The settings look alive, they are real visual treats\n- Great soundtrack\n\nCons:\n- Lacks crucial sound effects.  For example: no sounds from enemy projectiles, sounds that accompany enemy movements or strikes or large area of effect attacks. Your character doesn't make a sound when being hit... so no " ugh's" or what have you (or at least not any that I could discern).\n\n- Character move sets don't seem compatible with the game around you, there's a combo and dodge system that don't seem to work with how the enemies in the game world function.\n\n- Enemies don't seem to have a "tell" that would help identify when to use the dodge ability.\n\n- Enemies will always hit you no matter how you strike or if a combo is being executed.  Other issues with this is that enemies will clip through you and/or anchor you somehow (or in some cases get stuck in you), especially in mobs, which is ok in concept but the problem is that the game mechanics don't allow you to escape this.  This also causes the dodge ability to fail in mid execution, which renders dodging pointless.\n\n- The dodge button would greatly benefit to being tied with the directional input. Dodging is tied to the direction you're facing, so if you're facing large amounts of enemies sometimes you'll frantically be facing different directions which might make you end up "dodging" into an enemy, not away from it.\n\n- Even though button mashing is discouraged, the combo system isn't  fluid or responsive enough to tackle enemies adequately, especially in groups or with larger fiends.  Your character animations will be interrupted and you will sustain damage by proxy. So I found that if I switch back to the regular sword and then hammer on the attack button you'll end up progressing much further than doing it the way the game was intending you to.\n\n- A big problem for me is that I don't always understand why or how I died in a combat situation. The lack of sound effects and a visual sign of impact, you'll find that your health has been drained and you' re back at a checkpoint often and with a feeling that things aren't working correctly which leads to a lot of frustration.\n\n- A lack of weight in execution from the main character and enemies, feels like even though you're being hit or they're being hit, it has a lack of substance to it (it's hard to describe).  Like there isn't like a knockback on your character or the enemies, you'll swing your sword but it doesn't feel effective. When you're being hit you'll just have to take the games word for it via the health bar that you have been hit (if that makes sense?).\n\nIt looks like the devs are going to be patching the game up, so hopefully things will get fixed up.  The game is  just shy of hitting the mark at the moment.","March 26","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
