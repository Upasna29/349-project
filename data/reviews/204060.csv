In fact this game is strange in more ways than one. But it's because of it's peculiar personality that makes this game really special - it's more of an experience you get to play through.\n\nIt's a game for someone who's looking to get away from convention and try something different, as well as get in touch with the mythopoetical hipster side of them. Seriously.\n\nIt's not just a game for nostalgic pixel-art eye candy, and as linear as the story is, the gameplay sure isn't. For one thing, the game encourages you to take your time playing through because if you play through this game honestly you're meant to take a solid month to finish it. It also encourages you to explore the environment, because there are a lot of great things you'll only notice if you take the time to have fun and click around the different areas you explore within the different phases of the moon.\n\nFor such a tightly-packaged few hours of gameplay, it's an amazing game. Well worth playing through and grabbing all the accomplishments for.","June 2, 2015","true","13.3"," 63 of 68 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","63","68","0","0"

Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP offers you rather straightforward, but surprisingly moving story. Nostalgic, melancholy mood encompasses both worlds, and gets further enhanced by the music and commentary. Dry humour won't necessarily endear the tale to everyone, although I enjoyed the innovative narration.\n\nAs in any point & click game, you have to solve puzzles (varing in difficulty and nature) to move forward - and, well, it took some time for me to get used to SS&S EP mindset.\n\nMusic is beatiful - even if you're not interested in game, soundtrack is worth listening to. If you like pixel art, you will also love graphics. The world is detailed and alive, and holds much potential in my opinion; given how little we get to know about its mythology and geography, I feel kind of disappointed that SS&S EP offers only a small figment of its world. I would certainly like to see more.\n\nI recommend Superbrothers Sword & Sworcery EP to anyone curious enough to try rather meditative atmosphere.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kixu/recommended/204060/","Kixu","Tau","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kixu/","64 products in account","Nothing made sense, there was no story closure, no character progression, the game mechanics had no logic, no depth, there was virtually no interactivity so I might as well have watched a let's-play...  Pretty graphics and soundtrack, but that's it.\n\nWith some games, even if the gameplay isn't stellar, a player can derive something from the feeling of being in control of the character that they can't get from watching a let's-play (The Stanley Parable is an excellent example of this), but that's not the case here.  There's nothing.\n\nThe controls are point-and-click.  You guide the character around on a leash and solve "puzzles," and by “puzzle” I mean "click arbitrary things on the screen in an arbitrary order."  What sort of things?  Click all the ducks, or click all the trees, or click all the bushes – in a specific, arbitrary order.  It's just trial and error, with no rhyme or reason.  If you think perhaps I'm exaggerating, I don't blame you, but I'm not.  This game really is that mediocre.\n\nOccasionally you'll have to fight something.  Combat in this game is an extremely simple rhythm game.  It's tricky-enough to be a little frustrating, and bare-bones-enough to be boring.\n\nThe world that you explore is simultaneously small and tedious.  There are maybe three dozen locations.  They're all pretty, and backed by a great soundtrack, but devoid of things to do.  Around half of the locations are completely purposeless, and serve to do nothing more than take up your time as your character (slowly) walks through them on her way to the place you're trying to get to.\n\nTo be perfectly honest, I'm fine with games having decorative content that's just there to immerse you and give you a place to chill out.  Trouble is, these locations actually GET IN THE WAY of gameplay.  I don't want to spoil too much, but there's a sizable chunk of the game that you spend walking back and forth between two locations at opposite ends of the map, and I am completely baffled by that design decision.\n\nNow we have to talk about the story and dialogue, and...  Oh boy...\n\nThe game opens with a man who appears to be a shrink sitting in a plush chair.  He breaks the fourth wall and speaks directly to the player as his patient.  He refers to the game by name, describing it as a “therapy.”  The game is broken up into four “therapy sessions.”  If all of this sounds horribly pretentious, that's because it is.  The therapist (referred to as “The Archetype”) even subtly hints that if you aren't enjoying the game, it's because you aren't approaching it with the right mindset.\n\nThe Archetype persists throughout the game, constantly giving you “hints” (more like outright telling you what to do next) and breaking the fourth wall.  There is almost no opportunity afforded to the player to suspend disbelief.\n\nMost of the game takes place in a fairly classic fantasy setting, with swords, shields, monsters, ghosts and spellbooks.  But the characters, inexplicably, talk like modern-day stoners.  That's the most accurate description I can give.  Even the dog.  No, really, even the dog.  It's not funny or clever at all.  At first it's quirky, but the novelty wears off as you meet more characters, and discover that every single one talks in the same way.  It's like reading a fanfiction that's trying for self-depricating humor and falling short.  None of the characters speak seriously, and it makes it that much harder to get immersed in the game.\n\nAnyway, that was my experience playing Sword and Sworcery.  I finished the game, and I kind of regret it.","September 16, 2015","false","4.6"," 202 of 281 people (72%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","72","202","281","15","6"

In real world I think it would be around 500 meters from start to end, and there is no much verticality, or many areas you can enter.\n- You often need to go trough the same areas, and walking is really slow and you can't run. There are times where you need to "pull a switch" that is 3 minutes away from the "door" it opens, then go back... and then you get killed... by a guy you killed three times already. That's why it took me 5 hours.\n- Boss fights are very slow and are all basically the same. Then you die, and have to wait and click stuff for five minutes again.\n- The world IS interesting, but there is no backstory. You are there an have to do stuff, for no reason.\n- And who the hell is that Archetype ? If you can remove a part of the game without changing it, then it shouldn't have been there in the first place. He's just...put there, like the Twitter integration... what ?\n\nConclusion:\nI'm not saying this is a bad game, by the end it grew on me, but I can't recommend it. I think the game hasn't fullfiled it's potential and is overhyped. It looks and sounds great, but the devs missed an oportunity to make something bigger with it. Yeah, they made big money, but that it's not the point here.\n\nA bit more polished story and a larger world and it could have been great.","August 9, 2015","false","5.5"," 108 of 143 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","108","143","2","0"

The retro look is fun, the music is great, the puzzles are ok but the realization that you now have to spend 10 minutes backtracking to point A and back is just no fun. There is also the feeling the game is being cryptic for some hipster indie appeal rather game content reasons and the constant "tweet this!" prompts just add to this feeling, like the devs are reaching for cult status.

Not that I know anything about Superbrothers after having finished it, but I can safely say that calling the game an EP is actually pretty accurate... Gameplay is overall limited, and you're here for the 'magic', the music, and the atmosphere. Keep an open mind here, S&S doesn't play quite like any other game. You'll only be going through the game once, but if you finish it, it's a worthy experience as games go.

Its a point and click puzzle/adventure game with a heavy music influence and it has among the best game soundtracks I have heard so far. While not being the hardest game ever it is still challenging and has a lot of humour in it so enjoyed all my time spent in it. Its a game I'd recommend pretty much everyone to at least try as is an experience I'd want to share.\n\n\nMostly storyline achievements but some harder to find specific ones thrown in. I'd recommend a glance at a guide to find them all as you could very easily miss a few of them. There are also two achievements tied to not altering the time while playing the game (which makes sense once you have played the game) and one for....altering the time. Would recommend beating the game while only using real time or in-game means to beat the game and get the time-altering achievement as your last thing.\n\nTime to 100%: ~4½ hours","February 22, 2014","true","3.6"," 42 of 53 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","42","53","0","1"

You meet a few folks, fight a few beasts, and solve some puzzles (mostly by clicking at the proper time or in the proper order). This is all framed as some kind of "therapy session", presented by "The Archetype", a Fourth Wall-breaking, cigar-smoking quasi-narrator.\n\nThe major issue with this game is its far too pre-occupied with being quirky and self-aware. If it were a person, it'd be that guy who confuses the simple act of dressing in a suit and drinking martinis with having charisma and gravitas. He doesn't know etiquette, doesn't have any sorts of skills, has no refinement to his tastes, but covers for it by downplaying the importance of all those things. He's too cool to learn the rules but still thinks he can break them. That he's too good to know that stuff. He has no game, but think's he's a player.\n\nThat's what I got out of this game. The gameplay is extremely rudimentary and poorly designed on top of that. Skin pulled across bare-bones. Exploration consists of tromping across a simple path through several screens, very slowly. You click on things of interest to gain to be rewarded often with throw-away lines delivered in that Dudebro vernacular ("We saw a grave on the hill and wondered what was up with that". Riveting).\n\nPuzzles consist of going where the hint tells you. This isn't hard, it's just tedious and time-consuming, due to the aforementioned plodding walking pace. You only have a linear left-or-right path to take anyway. Once you arrive, you hold down the button for five seconds to make your Magic-Mode happen. You then click in an arbitrary fashion on things on the screen. Sometimes it's sheep, sometimes it's trees, sometimes it's birds. There's no logical connection to the objects and the puzzle. There's also no real logic to the order in which you must click them. It's just trial-and-error. It's about as difficult and as fun as stuffing a bunch of random toys into a toy chest so the lid closes.\n\nCombat consists of a rythm game that's extremely rudimentary. You can block, or hit. Wait for the cue, hit the enemy, or block his attack. Sometimes you attack his attack so it's bounced back, and they might bounce it back at you. Repeat until someone screws up.\n\nSo on top of this gameplay we get a presentation that's way too satisfied with itself. When something pretends to be much more clever or intelligent than it is, that's the textbook definition of "Pretention".\n\nDon't get this game, it's a waste of time.","January 28","false","1.9"," 78 of 113 people (69%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","69","78","113","9","7"

The point and click move system doesn't require you to excessively micromanage your moves. The puzzels are interesting and feel part of the worlds mistique. The combat is appropriately challenging with the exception of the boss battles which are disproportianately punishing, and have you sitting through long animations between each failure. The worlds not going to blow you away with it's originality but it's certainly a solid execution of the classic fantasy setting.\n\nUnfortunately this is all for nothing. Rather than let me sink into this worlds story and characters, the game repeatedly pulls the camera back for some 4th wall exposition. These don't actually add much information to the plot they just interrupt immersion for the sake of some snarky self referential, self congratulatory, ironic commentary. It feels like there were 4 writers and one of them was too cool to be a team player. After the second of these scenes you get this feeling you're just going through the motions to see the next lifeless monologue from "the smoking man". A lot of good work seems to have gone in this game, but an adventure game that can't hold your interest in it's story can't really accomplish anything.","November 25, 2013","false","3.7"," 184 of 297 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","184","297","2","4"

I think it'd probably agree with me more if I were 20 years old and playing it on an iPad while sitting in Starbucks, but the complete lack of UI concessions to acknowledge that this version is indeed running on a PC makes me want to kick someone in the junk every time I have to perform any action. The dialog also crosses back and forth across the line between clever and aggravatingly pretentious hipster nonsense, to the degree that I can't tell if it's meant to be on purpose or not.

I own this game on my iPad, too, and it definitely plays better there than it does on my PC.\n\nThe game is funny, and very self-referential, but the story is a zilch.\n\nThe story and gameplay combine to give you a "go here, do this.

Now go to that other special place, and do another special thing. Rinse and repeat until the game tells you that it's over.\n\nBut the art is pretty, and the game has a sense of humor about itself.

It's not a great soundtrack that stands on its own, but the music and sound improve the gameplay.\n\nI cautiously recommend this game for people who enjoy weird, indirect, self-referential media (you know who you are.)

The game is simplistic to play but, I was hooked till the very end. The game is like one of those “Where the f*** do I go” kind of games but, I don’t mean that in a bad way as you may think for the quotation sentience. The pixel visuals are really nice. At first, I wasn’t too keen on the game but, as I played more, I started to really love the look of it. The gameplay consists of you clicking on the environment to which the character will follow. You don’t really have full control of the characters but, I think it make you feel and take in the world and environment more. It’s a funny game but, at the same time, I felt, some sort of serious connection to the character as I got further into the game. I felt… something… at the game ended, which I can’t really explain nor did I expect. Every now and then you trigger random battles, which personally, I really like. At first I didn’t know what to do but you get the hang of it pretty quick.\n\nThe game tells you nothing. I like games like that. It doesn’t take your hand and flat out tell you what you need to do next. Other characters in the game give you clue as to what to do next and you take it from there.\n\nOverall I love this game. It’s one of those games that makes me wish I could make my own game. I know a few people wouldn’t but, I would say it’s worth the money and if I didn’t have the game (as in if I had played it at a friend house) I would buy it for myself. Even if I finished it.

This game isn't a horrible mess and its easy to play (but sometimes encompasses a few frustrating puzzles) coupled with this "I'M AN INDIE GAME" mentality prompt both a curious eye as well as a  turned nose.  And that is the problem....if a person didn't feel some of the vibes that this game was broadcasting and left it more subtle it would have left the player feeling "oh, well that was a cool and quaint little game."  Instead there is a "Tweet this" achievement mentality (marketing) and a even a scene where - You're now at a concert rocking out with Jim Guthrie..."who's Jim Guthrie?"  Oh an indie rocker that definitely understands his craft and instruments and the composer of this game (which does have a pretty cool soundtrack) but did the game really have to take this route?\n\nPart "me generation" development but "oh no, I'm an Indie" game.  And thats the problem.  This is why earlier reviews loved it but now every review now currently in the year 2015 is so on the fence.  In 2012 perhaps it was cool, perhaps it was "edgy."  Now, its a game that tells a quick little story with a few puzzles and backtracking.  The whole game can be viewed in youtube and while I do not regret having played it, and I am thankful for the soundtrack, I honestly can not recommend this as a buy.

What might have worked with touch controls is poorly translated to mouse.\nLazy game design - Most of the game time is spent travelling through screens or fighting with controls, actual content which required you to think or make decision could be completed in 30 mins. All the bosses are the same. Sometimes it felt that the game is being cryptic just to hide that there is in fact nothing to do. On the point of lazy game design, sometimes it turns out its more convenient to do nothing than actually play the game - eg. after I alter the moon phase in Moon Grotto, the spectre appears when I come out. Turns out it's easier to let myself be killed, because I will wake up by the hearth with no negative consequences from death and I save myself travelling a few screens to get into a dream.\nI don't mind artsy games, games which are slow paced etc. However playing this felt like watching an artsy animated film which requires you to constantly push play button, because it won't continue unless you do, although it gives you no challenge or satisfaction from doing so. The game feels like attention-seeking little kid and the feeling is reinforced by "Tweet this ?" prompts present almost anywhere.

It's part of being self-aware, of understanding your medium and using it well.\n\nThis game is frustrating because it takes this to its illogical conclusion: EVERYTHING is lampshaded, the fourth wall is broken constantly, and you're never given even a second to immerse yourself without the game reminding you that THIS is what it is doing, and isn't it so clever that it's doing that and aware of it?\n\nCoupled with bafflingly poor game design decisions (that you're perhaps supposed to appreciate for the irony?) like running across an entire established world several times for a quest, being all but required to adjust your date and time settings on your actual computer, and Twitter integration of all things, this game trips over itself to get in the way of your having fun.\n\nThe art is pretty, though.

It's really great to look at, has great music and sounds, but is not really much of a game. It's an incredible waste because what's good is amazing, but they should have put more work into the game portion. It's no better on a tablet FYI.\n\nOK, you click and explore a bit, but every puzzle is the same. You click on yourself and hold until your "sworcery" activates. Then you click on usually obvious stuff in the background until you solve the puzzle. Advanced puzzles involve clicking and holding. Seriously it's that simple. You're going to walk slowly through the same (gorgeous) screens over and over. You're going to watch the album flip slowly from side A to B at least 3 times. Combat is slightly more engaging, but it's really just like quick time events. Often it's an actual QTE when your shield lights up and you click it. There are no inventory puzzles.\n\nJim Guthrie makes great music, and this game is basically an ad for his album. At one point you wander into one of his concerts.\n\nI couldn't stand the writing. On the one hand you have a bronze age story of confronting an ancient evil, but everyone is self-referential undermining the mythopoesis of the world (they use that word in the game FYI). It's 4th wall breaking. I guess to keep you from being immersed in the game world for some reason. It's beautiful, but I think they realized it was too small.\n\nFinally, there are some Legend of Zelda references for some reason. You are collecting 3 triangles and one of your first acts is to enter a giant stone head of Gannon. Your final act does something and you die. I guess you stopped an ancient evil but there's no payoff.

In look and tone, Superbrothers embodies a lot of what I love about indie gaming - simple yet beautiful. Even on first impressions it wasn't perfect - not as deep as Undertale, not as complex as The Witcher, nowhere near as difficult as Binding of Isaac. I began to get annoyed at forced wait times for the moon cycles, but there are ways around it, inside the game and out. But I was enjoying myself... until near the end of the game.\n\nBefore that though, I have my own personal complaints. This game was originally designed for the iPad, and this especially shows in the game's combat. Fighting the handful of bosses/creatures relies on twitch reflexes, which is fine for touchscreens, but is abominable with mouse controls, especially for laptop mice. I can't move the cursor to switch between attack and defense quick enough unless I know in advance what attack they'll use and when - it's the same every time. I'd say the Trigon battles would be near impossible if they didn't follow a pattern AND that you can use your sword and shield with the Z and X buttons, respectively (I also don't recall that being explained at any point) Fortunately, you don't have to do this too much - once for each of the three trigons and maybe two or three other occasions. This brings me back to the atrocious wait times that would make freemium games facepalm. The lunar cycles can be manipulated easily enough through various means, but that isn't what I'm getting at. I'm talking about the Trigon boss fights. Due to the facts that you can only carry a few healing items, you can't leave the boss area once you enter it (not even dying will fix this), and the aforementioned terrible combat, you'll soon be stuck next to the boss with 1 star of health left, no mushrooms to heal yourself, and no way to leave to get more. I've been told that you can get health back between boss phases by holding the shield button. There's two problems with that. One, at no point in game is this explained until you actually say screw it and run headlong at the fight, and two, it only works for me when it feels like it. So, in my current position as of writing this, to beat the last Trigon I'll have to either have insane reflexes normally reserved for bullet hell shooters and not get hit once, find some way to make the shield heal thing work, or wait until the game resets me back in the real world to start the entire process over. Joy.\n\nThis game is, in my opinion, more about doing the most it can with very little. References are made to popular games like Zelda and Mario, and most of the speech uses modern colloquialisms, particularly social media lingo. Some might say that it's just trying to trigger nostalgia, spread the word about the game, and add to its supposed quirky, self-aware pretentiousness. I would have to half-agree there, however, I only casually use social media and nostalgia alone doesn't work with me. Personally, I think the soundtrack and personality of the game are good, but it's not for everyone. I'd still take this over bland AAA title du jour any day of the year.The combat is awful on PC (get the iPad version instead if you can), the wait times are up there with the mobile moneysuckers it desperately wants to rub elbows with, and there is little worth going back for once you beat the story. However, I've played much, much worse. Go for it if you want to support smaller indie devs, but if you do want this game, then maybe wait for a sale - given how short the game is, $8-9 is kind of a bit much.","March 7","false","6.4"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

As I write this, I'm still not entirely sure how to describe what exactly it was I experienced.\n\nThe general gameplay consists of you searching beautiful low poly. highly detailed environments for strange creatures known as 'sylvan sprites' by clicking multiple points in the environment. The game gives very little direction as to what parts of the environment you should be clicking and the direction that the game does decide to give you is delivered via nonsensical, highly confusing messages through in game twitter like updates from the few characters.\nWhile I presume these messages were meant to contain hints, half the time I couldn't decipher what was random nonsense and what was the game's way of trying to point me in a particular direction. This resulted in me randomly clicking my way through most of the puzzles, which worked out fine except on a handful of occasions.\n\nWhile the gameplay leaves a lot to be desired, it's everything else that makes this game worth experiencing. The writing, while cryptic and often times silly, sets a very laid back tone as you quest to save this musically infused world.\nThe charming art design combined with the beautifully composed music gives this game a sense of style like no other and I often found myself in awe of the relationship between the two.\n\nThe story isn't partiuclarly deep or complex but the quirky and episodic nature in which it unfolds makes this a game worth seeing through to the end.","August 19, 2015","true","7.1"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","14","20","0","0"

I loved it all the way through, but some of the negative reviews here have some points. For one thing the game is terribly short - though it says 'small world' in the game description. Another is that the click to move is often considerably slower and more clumsy than I would like, and finally the humor is hit or miss. Sometimes it puts a grin on your face, other times it's eye-roll worthy.\n\nWith that said, this is roughly the equivelant of an indie prog-rock concept album, only instead of lyrics you get gameplay. Most of the puzzles involve clicking and experimenting with the environment while 'meditating' and are all in themselves relatively simple. The combat involves some reflexes, but has set patterns which can allow even people with slow reflexes to survive it.\n\nThe star of the show is the music - play this with a good set of headphones and enjoy the atmosphere it creates, don't play this game if you like to rush, and don't go expecting shakespeare instead of beowulf.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ArturoGTZP/recommended/204060/","ArturoGTZP","zerepzerreitug","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ArturoGTZP/","33 products in account","I'm really intrigued by what I just played. Sword & Sworcery is a strange mix of funny self-awareness as a game and art project; pretty pixel landscapes and nice soundtrack; all mixed in a plot that goes from the super-serious to the super-casual in waves. The game is never out-right comedic, but you can tell from screen to screen where you're supposed to relax and where you are supposed to be tense. What fascinates me is how even with its pixelated characters the game manages to make you feel stressed, afraid, rejoiced or frustrated as you go.\n\nOne of the game elements that is constant throughout the story is the lack of a expectations on what is possible and what not within the environment. I found myself unable to judge if I had any agency in this or that environment or situation, which in this game, is a good thing. You feel great when you realize that you CAN interact with this or that element, and once the creepy monster starts to chase you, this lack of understanding about where are the game-boundries makes you feel trapped and powerless as you desperately click everything on screen while moving away as you trying to figure out what to do next.\n\nGranted, this lack of context did made me go for an online guide once I couldn't figure out how to wake up one or two of the Sprites. But overall, if you have enough curiosity and patience, you will get the hang of this strange little world without external help.\n\nAnother thing that I found really original about this game is how the difficulty raises as the story progesses. We're used to getting more health and power in other titles, allowing you to combat fiercer and bigger enemies as you go. But in Sword & Sworcery you get LESS health as the main character's well-being begins taking a toll on the quest, which makes formerly easy challenges suddenly stressful and difficult. This increase in vulnerability goes counter to the power-trip most other games makes you go through, and that alone, I found it to be really cool (as well as REALLY nerve-wrecking as I faced old enemies).\n\nThat being said, this is not a fighting game per se. Sure, the fights are the parts that require most eye-hand coordination and skill, but the puzzle solving and exploration take a similar toll in your brain. I found it very balanced how much emphasis it was put onto each part of the gameplay.\n\nOh, another thing I liked: At the end of each "chapter" the narrator takes you back to the main screen, telling you to take a break before continuing. I found this to be cool in terms of story-telling, and oddly considerate for you as a player. It made me wish more games would suggest that kind of pauses for their players.\n\nSo overall, this is a very strange, charming, deep, stressfull and rewarding game all at once. It's a bit short compared to other titles, but by the end, you'll be glad by every minute of it.","April 13, 2015","true","5.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

It was designed as an experiment to see how social media and gaming interact with one another. The quirky 2nd person narration and access to twitter make the game feel as if you're traveling with the main character to complete her woeful errand. It's very slow to start, but the game becomes very suspenseful towards the end and you'll be glad you've stuck with it if you make it that far.\nPerhaps this revitalization of the Adventure Game genre is ahead of its time and not easily understood by the more impatient or less educated, but I found it to be a magical story about martyrdom. I went in curious as to what this game was (I received it with Humble Indie Bundle 5), and came out with a heavy heart. The emotion at the end really struck me.

I'm ok about waiting real-life time when it comes to mobile games (e.g. to replenish my lives), in fact the Steam version is merely a port of the iOs version, but I can't stand when I can't play a PC game whenever I want.

I would definitely recommend playing on mobile as opposed to PC, as it was clearly built with that form factor in mind.\n\nAs the name suggests, Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP is a bit of a musical experiment wrapped up in a video game. Records (or Big Black CDs as I used to call them) show up with some frequency in the game as little reminders to pay attention to the awesome sounds being gently pushed into your ear canals. I enjoyed the music so much that I went and bought the soundtrack.\n\nMost of the visuals are very simple, very 16-bit. But every once in a while there is something that is nice and smooth. These objects usually don't belong with the rest of their surroundings, and the difference in visual style helps to emphasize that sense of alienation.\n\nDespite the fact that the visual style is very pixelated, there were quite a few moments that just took my breath away. The best part about them is that I didn't see them coming, so the awe factor was even greater.\n\nMost of the game is spent with the device in landscape, and you walk around by either holding down on the spot you want your character to walk to, or you double-tap there.\n\nHowever, when you rotate the device into portrait, she will unsheathe her sword and prepare for battle. Obviously whenever there is an enemy nearby this is what you want to do.\n\nThe combat always follows the pattern of "tap the shield when your enemy is going to attack" until "your enemy is vulnerable, tap the sword." Each enemy has different patterns to them (usually the music gives you a hint at what that pattern is) so you have to stay on your toes. The boss battles are really intense, especially if you make a couple of mistakes at the beginning and can't afford to get hit when it gets really crazy. I'm pretty sure that I got more than a few weird looks while I was sitting in the TV lounge yelling at my tablet that it wouldn't defeat me.\n\nIn between the battles there are quite a few puzzles. The hints are often very cryptic, but they are always enough to get you going in the right direction and once you have started the rest just kind of follows.\n\nThe tone of the game is hard to describe, as it has several parts that almost conflict. The game is very meta, and makes references to the fact that you are outside of the game world affecting the events inside the game world. It also has a great sense of humor, and is often very frank with its jokes. At the same time it is very serious, and you are always aware that the events that are taking place cannot lead to a happy ending.\n\nThe game, while being very story-driven, is also very easy to digest in small chunks. This is very important in  a mobile game. The chapters are not too long, and they make sure to remind you what is going on at the beginning of each one.","March 12, 2013","true","5.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

There's some weirdness in the game being a mobile port, particularly when it comes to the fact that your mouse cursor is accompanied by a big dimming area on the screen, but it's mostly just a minor oddity. A few mechanics things could do with some more explaining, but otherwise it was pretty accessible (hold up your shield in combat for a while to heal; some of the puzzles require you to enter combat mode without an opponent and either hit things or hold up your sword; a few other things).\n\nI enjoyed the setting - it's a weird, mythical Caucasus, where the characters talk in remarkably modern and kind of hipsterish/ironic ways (which I actually thought was quite entertaining, but might throw some people off). The one thing I didn't enjoy was the weird meta-narrative, though - there's a man in a suit who appears in interludes, and seems to talk to the player directly as a separate character from S&S's protagonist. I don't really understand the point of that element, and would have been fine with the rest of the game's simple story on its own.\n\nOverall - it's aesthetically pleasing, accessible, interesting, and doesn't overstay its welcome.

That's all this game has going for it. Not great either, just good.\n\nBeyond that, you have several negative points you'll be frustrated by constantly. The controls are really bad. I know this game was designed first for a touchscreen interface, but even with that in mind, they were done wrong. No other touchscreen game I've played has had you *double-click* to do your primary action. Hell, most don't even make you do it for alternate actions. Do you want to wear out your finger or mouse? Now you can!\n\nThe game world is also really vague in how its levels are layed out, and how they look visually. This means that you'll be backtracking constantly, because you forgot which way was "forward" and which was back where you just came from. This wouldn't be so bad by itself, but it combines with the aforementioned bad controls, and the slow movement, to make the simple act of moving around a grinding chore.\n\nThe nail in the coffin is all of the self-referential, condescending, pretentious dialog and writing of the game. It constantly feels like you're talking to that one "artist" you met at a party. You know the one. When you ask them what they do, they talk about how "quirky and random their life journey has turned out. LoL!" When you ask them what their art is about, they say "Everyone brings their own interpretation!"\n\nDo not buy this game.","April 8","false","0.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

How it's only strong point is that it's able to beat the player over the head with a bludgeon that has the names of every crap artist out there on it; but considering everyone seems to love SuperBrothers Steaming pile of ♥♥♥♥, I'd like to just say a few words.\n\nThis game is the most boring 'game' I've ever played, and I made it 3 hours into Little Inferno. But at least Little Inferno tried shoving it's moral down your throat like some highschool boy on prom night. Superbrothers Swords and Sharks was just plain boring. There was no substance, nothing to hold you to the game. It droned on and on and on, trying to point something out to you but I had no idea what the hell it was trying to say. It might've been saying, "Hey, isn't integration with social media sites a great thing?" And if it was, it would be wrong. Because it's not. It's tedious and annoying.\n\nNow, I've played flash games like this. With the whole blocky, pixel art style and the clicking and the music; but SuperSorcerer and the Goblet of Swordcraft was just plain terrible. Not only do they expect people to shell out $8 for this, but it's a terrible port from a bloody tablet. And if that's not enough, people are actually praising it! I just don't get it. Don't buy it. Save yourself. Buy something good. Buy a book.\n\nEDIT: On Gametime, I made it less than an hour in. It was hard, damnit. I tried. I really did. I wanted to like it because everyone else did.

Its a game where you can enjoy exploring and seeing the world while you're progressing, and it leaves very little fluff in terms of exploration, just about every area in the game is important in some way at some point. The dialogue and character interactions are also great, and they're presented in an interesting way that makes the game feel more like a story. The game can be finished in about 2 hours but it offers the option to pace yourself, which I highly recommend to enjoy the game like a series of snacks. I played it on an iPad first and found it much more intuitive to control using the touchscreen interface.

The emphasis is mostly on the puzzles.\n\nThe good:\nThis game has undeniably a good soundtrack that really enhances the mood.\nThe pixelated graphic is well done with a great attention to details and smooth animations. If you don’t mind this style it’s definitely in the good end of pixelated games.\nA somewhat interesting way of telling its story (kinda good but not really).\n\nThe bad:\nSadly good sound and interesting art style is not enough to have a good game, and sadly this is the only thing this game really has going for it…\n\nThe fighting mechanics are neither interesting nor good. Fighting seems pointless most of the time.\nThe puzzles are just uninteresting – subjective yes, but that’s how I felt.\nYou spend an eternity just walking…\nThe dialogue is *sigh* not good.

Engaging gameplay should always be the main focus of any game, but Sword & Sorcery just fell flat. Action? Puzzles? It didn’t really excel in any area.\nI was glad when the game actually told me to quit after completing the first chapter.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateGodfrey/recommended/204060/","PrivateGodfrey","Captain MooMoos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateGodfrey/","490 products in account","This is a rather long review, so if you just want a brief summary of why I recommend this game skip to Results and read from there.\n\nSuperbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP is clearly a tablet game; something that if you don't know before going in will really make you sour.\n\nStory:\nSuperbrothers: Sword & Sworcery is the story of a gender ambiguous character that embarks on a mission to bring peace to the land. An evil monster has arisen after the powerful tome was taken from its castle. As you progress through your epic quest you learn to realize how great a toll is put upon a true hero. The world twists and turns around you and the sounds of nature great a lullaby. You must fight to collect the trigons of power and assemble to force necessary to defeat the evil that has plagued the land.\n\nCampaign:\nThe game is interesting and offers a mixture of sounds, visuals, and thoughts that create an absorbing atmosphere. The landscape repeats itself, as there are only about 20-25 different screens (this is a rough estimate). Some of these screens you only go to once, so realistically you run through the same 10-15 most of the time going backward and forward. You play as a character (of some gender) and go through their adventure defeating evil from the land; rather a basic adventurer’s tale is it not? But what really makes the story great is how the world unfolds in front of you drawing you in through the lore of the land. The tome which you find at the beginning allows you  to read into the thoughts and feelings of those around you. Giving you a sense of understanding and wonder of how you are viewed by your friends, colleagues, and pet.\n\nGameplay:\nThe combat system is deficient as it is definitely optimized for two fingers. In order to initiate a “defend” or “attack” command you must move the cursor from one button on the screen to another and click. Moving the mouse and clicking the commands can be rather difficult in high stress boss fights. Most of the fights are simple and even the boss fights are not too tough, but when you lose against a boss you have to watch the fight animation all over again. It would be similar to watching Goku charge all the way to Super Sayan then the VHS losses track and you have to start all over again. The first time the charge up is awesome, but if you have to watch it two times in a row its infuriating. The soundtrack and imaginative story is what makes this game.\n\nQuests:\nThe quests can be rather annoying, and a few times I had to look online for guides because the game wants you to click random patterns to solve a mystery without any hints on how the pattern would look. True I could have sat there for 20 minutes and figured it out, but that is just a waste of time.\n\nResults:\nMinus some of the elementary problems with the game, its interesting approach to a RPG/Arcade game. Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery pulls you through with a rather interesting story and mystical element that makes you wonder the whole time what will happen next. Pulling on your emotions and your curiosity this game is definitely an interesting and play-worthy game. Just make sure you understand when you get in that this game that it was designed as a tablet game. I recommend this game, but only if you can get it for a good price. I personally wouldn’t buy this unless it was 75% or more off. Waiting for a sale may seem frugal, but l on the itunes/play marketplace this game is $4.99, meaning that the $7.99 cost on Steam is way above what it should be.\n\nPros:\n+The soundtrack, the music really builds up the atmosphere of this game.\n+The story is at first a mystery that unravels to leave you wanting more.\n+Characters and environment really run together.\n+Its broken up into good length chapters.\n+Incorporation of character thoughts allows you to really delve into the stories of the people.\n+Not mentioned, but the dog which guides you through your adventure was a very good concept.\n\nCons:\n-Games playable areas are very few and overused.\n-Fighting is not designed for computers, and thus requires you to click buttons on a screen (when they could have easily incorporated two physical buttons in order to use the fighting commands).\n-There are very few settings and customization options.\n-Boss fights have way too long of animations.","February 22, 2014","true","3.6"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

While fitting into the pixelated art style that is becoming more popular by the minute, this game may be the only one to pull it off in such a gorgeous and vivid way.  Bright colors, unique environments, and the cute little creatures of the forest are all implemented perfectly and without excess noise to drown everything out.  The graphical content of this game never ceases to disappoint.  From a tiny village, to a waterfall going through the middle of the woods, and even a concert venue with a bear, Capybara makes everything work and keep you wanting more.\n\nSword & Sworcery tells the tale from a Scythian woman’s point of view as she steals a tome and proceeds to fight a towering specter, numerous small triangles that form a larger triangle, and even that mysterious bear inside a tree that is much bigger on the inside. Using the tome to read your, and everyone else’s, thoughts from second person, this title provides a fun and humorous way to keep you coming back.\n\nWhile this game is short, it is split into sections.  To prolong this game, I recommend playing each session on a different day.  As short as it may be, Sword & Sworcery is a fantastic game with a wonderful soundtrack and is for anyone who likes adventure, pixel-art, art in general, or just having a good time.","November 17, 2014","true","6.2"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","0"

I did like the art style, music, and the setting but the story was nothing special and the characters were pretty flat. i did not mind the constant 4th wall breaking but i did mind the hipster talk that was omnipresent. also the actual gameplay was not really engaging (it basically consists of two kinds of very simple puzzles). i still do recommend the game but people should go in with lower expectations.","January 3, 2014","true","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What you can do at any given point in the game is based on the current phase of the moon, but we're talking phases of the moon as they are measured in the real world, based on our system clock.\n\nBecause of that this three hour game could potentially become fragmented across an entire month! Fortunately there are a couple ways around this. One is a secret mechanism built into the game that still lets you finish the game honestly, while the other is a click away but will get you a nice achievement tagging you as a cheater.\n\nSword & Sworcery gives off a very dark and mysterious feeling and the great soundtrack helps set the mood along with the beautifully done pixel graphics. There are only a handful of battles in the game which are simple QTE, and the slang dialogue feels completely out of place.  Worth at least trying for something fresh.","July 1, 2012","true","4.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Journey Through a Quirky Audiovisual ExperienceGenre: 2D Point & Click Adventure\nDeveloped & Published by: Capybara Games\nPlatform: Windows, Mac, Linux, Mobile.\nBusiness Model: Base Game\nCopy Purchased by Myself Overall Gameplay Thoughts\nAt its core, Superbrothers is a 2D point and click adventure game. You click on places to move, try to find objects to help you progress and experience a story mainly told through the music and pixelart. Said pixelart is a very dense affair and can take some getting used to. Combat is handled in a 1v1 mini-game where you need to time your attacks or defense with what the enemy is doing. It’s ok, a bit annoying but otherwise harmless and you, thankfully, won’t encounter it too often. The game is on the short side, clocking in at about four hours but I felt I got my monies worth.\n\nStory Thoughts\nThe game follows the adventures of a Scythian and her adventures in locating a mysterious object called the “Megatome”. She is nameless and her past is unknown. Well, that goes for most everyone you’ll encounter. There’s not a learning about pasts, just experiencing the here and now. You interact with a few people in the game, but the game mostly focuses on exploring the world and trying to find objects as you go through it. There are a few occasions where you’ll fight a wolf and an object known as the Golden Trigon but they’re few and far between. The game also likes to insert amusing jokes and references as well as break the fourth wall. Overall, the story is fairly ok.\n\nDifficulty Thoughts\nThe puzzles weren’t too bad on difficulty, so long as you could figure out how the game wanted you to interact with it. There is a bit of a learning curve to the controls, especially if you’re new to the genre. While there was the occasional puzzle that could be difficult to solve, I managed to get by most of them just fine. They usually require you to move your mouse in a certain way or click on the right places of the screen in the right order. Sometimes the game can be frustrating because it won’t clue you in on whether you’re trying to solve the puzzle correctly so that can lead to a lot of brute force guessing.\n\nPC Settings and Port Report\nIt made the port to PC rather reasonably but it’s still missing quite a bit. What it does have, is a plentiful amount of resolution options, fullscreen on/off, Twitter integration (though I have my doubts this works anymore) and a single volume slider. It would have been nice to see multiple audio sliders and the ability to configure graphics. The game handles itself well on both the desktop and mobile devices though I think the touch experience is preferred. Though, I doubt you’ll really feel like you're missing anything when using the mouse. There weren’t any serious porting issues reported and the game didn’t have any major bugs or crashes when I gave it a go.\n\nThe visuals presented in Superbrothers are a rich and dense pixelart design and are quite interesting to look at. Combined with the atmospheric chiptune/electronic soundtrack, it really creates a unique experience as you travel through the levels.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nPoint and clicks like Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery are a mixed bag for me. I always seem to get really intrigued by the concept but the execution doesn’t always gel with me. Sure, the game was oddly engaging for me when I first played it back in 2012 and I think it still holds up now. I also won’t deny that a lot of the homages♥♥♥♥♥♥ences to the Legend of Zelda series probably helped me enjoy this game more than I normally would. That said, the combat is pretty lacking and it can feel like the game is being unnecessarily obtuse at times. Puzzles can be confusing or downright frustrating, requiring you to force brute them or look up hints online. Which I’ve found is pretty typical of minimalist point-and-clicks like these. It’s why I don’t like playing them too often. As for Superbrothers, I still think it’s worth giving a go if you’re into this genre or want an introduction to it.\n\nRead this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me]","June 8, 2012","true","4.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is a game that isn't afraid to be self-conscious and sometimes poke fun at itself and at what it is trying to achieve. The ironic tone of the dialogue makes this clear from the onset, and although I enjoyed the wry wit and humour on display, there were times when I couldn't help but think what might have been if the developers hadn't felt the need to abruptly break the fourth wall so often and had taken this wonderful thing they had created at face value and just ran with it.

Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP is, without a doubt, one of the most beautifully designed and evocatively atmospheric games I have ever witnessed.

The hauntingly atmospheric music and brilliantly minimalistic sound design make this wonderful mystical world come to life. Sometimes, while wondering around, I would just stop and not do anything at all and just look and listen and just try to soak it all in.\n\nBut of course there's more to this whole strange and fantastic adventure, there's a mystery to be solved, secrets to be uncovered, moon phases to be observed, hidden things to be clicked on, places to be discovered, monsters to be fought, and a story to be told and experienced and remembered and cherished. I can't but recommend Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP in the strongest terms. It's a wonderful thing to behold.","February 27, 2013","true","7.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Hell, I met Jim Guthrie's (game's musician) in-game avatar while dreamwalking by a full moon, and as he improvised a small jam session, I just laid back on my chair while listening to the music, just as my character did in-game. Talking about Jim Guthrie, I would like to personally thank the good sir/lady who made so that his album is gifted with the game.\n\nEverything in S:S&S is oddly satisfying, from the release of the sprites, to the rythm-based battles, and just wandering around, or, even better, dreamwalking in the mountain's people minds.\nAnd don't even get me started on the moon gimmick, which is an absolutely astounding idea.\n\nYou quickly empathize with the heroine, a 'Scythian' whom nothing you know about, and you will care for her until the end of her woeful errand, if you are brave or heartless enough to lead her there.\n\nS:S&S is for you, who actually read books in the Elder Scrolls.\nIt is for you, who actually understood Dark Souls' lore.\nEspecially for you, who keep preciously video game music on your phone.\nIt is for the dreamer who still resides in few of us.\n\nOr is it just for me?","December 23, 2014","true","7.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a wonderful thing to behold.","February 27, 2013","true","7.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Whether a painting is a masterpiece or just some colour on  canvas is entirely up to debate. As is whether video games can ever be considered art?\n\nSuperbrothers: Sword and Sworcery EP is art, plain and simple. It’s stunning, it’s gorgeous, it’s moving, it gets down to the bottom of your heart and invokes the deepest levels of emotion. Happiness, sadness, loneliness, fear, these are the feelings that have stuck with me after the completion of the Scythian’s woeful errand.\n\nAnd what an errand it was. Sword and Sworcery doesn’t really explain much. You’re a Scythian, you’re on a quest of some kind, you wake up in a forest and are pretty much left to figure out the rest by yourself. The game presents its story through messages that are all less than 140 characters. It’s all very self-aware, quite humorous stuff and it’s what sets the tone of the game, lighthearted, but with serious undertones. To say more would spoil the journey.\n","November 4, 2012","true","5.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Inspired by classics like The Legend of Zelda this game's visuals are crafted with beautiful pixel art. Be aware: This is NO retro look! Back in the day, this many different colours on the screen were unthinkable. To the beautiful art style comes an outstanding soundtrack and a (more or less) fluid gameplay.\n\nIf you don't have an iPad or similar Android tabled and you're interested in this game, you should definetely check it out here!

But I love it.\n\nReasons I love it?\n- killer soundtrack. Seriously, even if you don't want to play this game, pull up the OST and give it a listen. It's one of my favorite soundtracks to listen to while I study or write papers.\n- the dialogue is hilarious. I've read a lot of reviews which pit the writing as pretentious hipster nonsense, but I just don't see it. The game got more than a few chuckles out of me. I mean, two of the characters you encounter first are Dogfella (a dog) and Logfella (a lumberjack).  I dunno, it tickled me senseless.\n- the Grizzled Boor. This guy is a nut, seriously how do you guys come up with this ♥♥♥♥ lol. Uh uhuh uh uh uh.\n- the pixel art style is deadly. The first couple of times I loaded up the game I distinctly remember letting out a few involuntarily audible moans of "cooooooool"\n- the gameplay and puzzles are directly tied to the actual phases of the moon. THE MOON. How neat is that? The entire game should, in theory, take you at least a full lunar cycle to complete. That is, unless you can come up with some way to alter the moon's phases yourself, you cheater.\n- the combat is easy-going, which may or may not appeal to you. It's all personal preference, you know?\n- the puzzles were challenging, but not impossible. Once you get into the rhythm of the game a bit the solutions will come easier to you. I'm a huge puzzle nerd though.\n- great for touch-screen devices, if you're into that.\n- it's refreshing to have a female lead, honestly. She's just trying to complete her woeful errand, you know, doing her own thing, being a heroine and such.\n\nOverall, I'd have to say this is one of the quirkiest games I've ever played, and I sincerely hope you like it as much as I have.","July 16, 2015","true","6.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

This is a lovely ipad conversion of a short, amusing, yet subtly bleak fantasy tale. You play a girl who turns up in a forest, accidentally causes a bad thing to come about, and then must fix things, all the while getting to know the few people you're stuck in the forest with and your destiny. It's divided into four parts and carefully narrated by a mysterious archetype figure. He even suggests when you might have had enough by punctuating the end of each chapter with a sort of summary of events and a kind of 'until next time...' attitude. Even though the game is quite short, it's broken up into four of these easily digestible chapters. Having EP in the title, the music is obviously one of the centrepoints and Guthrie does a great job of stimulating an apt mood for the moment with some unusual synth tracks. There are things that might put people off - it's pixel-art, it's fairly slow going, sometimes the way to do some of the puzzles is a little obtuse, but the pace is important to setting the mood, the weird puzzles further fit with the unique nature of the game, and the humour is great, with regular comments from "you" and others that tend to look at situations sideways and often break the fourth wall. It's a lovely tale to see, hear and play and more people should experience the whole of this.","January 11, 2014","true","4.7"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

The music is some of the greatest I have heard in an indie game. It fills the surroundings and oozes with life. Sound effects play a key-role in puzzle solving and give ample combat hints to dodge an enemy attack. The puzzles are also cleverly constructed and are not hard to solve, yet leave you with a pleasant feeling after doing so. 'The graphics are 8bit and we are fine with that.'

From booting up the game you can instantly tell it is going to be quite a different experience. Every aspect of this game feels very....indie. The music is indie, the art is indie, hell. its an indie game! The music is just fantastic. The game comes with the music files ready to be imported into itunes so if you this music is your cup of tea, you can listen to it on the go. The game takes moments to laugh at itself which I though was great and with the sparatic randomness, you never really know what to expect in the next area. The game is split up into 4 parts which makes it much easier to play through by making actual times for you to take breaks if you wish. Now the story is not entirely gripping and the barebones gamplay is not complex at all. The humor will make you smile and the purity of the game will make your smile wider. The boss fights can be somewhat frustrating but you will establish a rhythm and beat them in no time. You could buy this game for the soundtrack alone its so good. I give this game an 8/10 and a high recommendation to anyone who likes  indie games and games with a very unique artstyle.

That might have more to do with the genre than the game itself, though.\n\nThe best part is undoubtedly the music. The delivery is good too; just experiencing the world is half of what the game is. Visually it is hit and miss; the pixel art looks great however there are often parts that are too detailed and stand out for it, such as the sprites. And the combat reminded me of Quest for Glory, which I enjoyed.\n\nThe game doesn't try to hold your hand too much, thankfully, but reading over the Megatome can always put you on the right path (and adds to the experience besides).\n\nWhat I didn't like was the very obvious touchpad controls. They work completely fine, but the game could have been made more enjoyable with better mouse control rather than just substituting the mouse pointer for a finger. Also the blatant twitter integration was groan-worthy... but I could accept it with the way they presented all of the dialogue.\n\nUltimately I'd say that if you are interested in Superbrothers that you should try to catch it on sale. It is good, but completely skippable.","July 6, 2014","true","4.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

To me it was more of a nuisance than anything else because I didn't care whether people knew I was playing the game or not.  Had there been a moment that I wanted everyone to know about then it would have been another story....but apparently there wasn't.\n\nAside from the lackluster attempt to get me to advertise for them, the developers behind S:S&S did deliver in one promise they made at the beginning of the game: good sound and jazzy music.  This Jim Guthrie fellow made some solid tunes throughout the game.  Particularly I liked the tunes the flowed After each I defeated and retrieved each Trigon, while I was in the dream world during a full moon, and when the Gogolithic Mass chased me.\n\nThe one aspect I was trying to explore while playing the game was the insatiable curiosity I had about how the entire dialog of the game reminded me of something a schmo would say while hanging with his other friend schmo.  There were modern colloquialisms, filler words, and then suddenly words that fit the context of the game.  After thinking about this for awhile I developed in my mind a voice that I imagined would speak this way in real life.  I imagined this voice would belong to someone who liked groups like Ben Folds Five, but also would watch episodes of Sesame Street simply because few people his age would do it.  A voice that grew up in the 90's with a tinge of modern hipster.  And then I heard this.\n\nALL MY ASSUMPTIONS WERE VALIDATED!\n\nThat point aside, I also wondered if most artistic games share characteristics similar to conventional art in that if they reflect the personality of the designer then they will be much more popular (of course among people who find that personality type amiable).\n\nIn the name of Buddha, Amen.\n\nHere is my playalyzation of the this game\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYBJxdpXNnt5ajxbZZcIp6qmG6UYq7lf4","October 29, 2014","true","8.1"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Let's give it a listen.\n\nWell, dude, before we listen we need to think about what we are listening to. Superbrothers from a story perspective, follows the riveting and sacrificial journey of a warrior woman who isn't from around Migmi Taw. She has to place together esoteric constructs in order to defeat a dark force. In short, it's a tragic hero's journey through and through, but with a twist. During loading screens and within certain objects the game's administrator breaks the forth wall reminding us that we are playing a thought experiment with a twitter overlay. Overall the plot of this game maybe isn't moving or entirely grounding in solid logic, but it is very relaxing. It's a story that you will find yourself slowly slipping into just enjoying, even if you don't quite understand it all. In short, Superbrothers is thought provoking, complex, but most importantly just casually enjoyable. Compounding on that relaxing story line is the game's stellar presentation. The creators went the route of a beautifully detailed pixel art style and holy crap does it impress. Environments are vibrant and varied, begging you to explore every single inch. You'll move from a concert to a forest to a massive monolith in mere moments. Not to mention the environments show you how to solve the puzzles given to your character, which means you never feel completely lost or stuck. From a battle design standpoint, these locals are made for exploration and variable atmosphere not combat. Still no location in the game traps you into combat without giving you a chance to ready yourself, meaning that you won't die and flip a table. The game play in Sword & Sworcery is really the only major weak point in the experience. Originally developed as an IOS application, the game's touch screen control system has been poorly appropriated to its PC counterpart. So many aspects of puzzle solving, combat, and movement can feel uncomfortable due to the constant feeling that you’re moving too slow or that your keyboard is uncomfortable. It greatly detracts from the experience on the whole and it's a complete shame, since it could have been fixed by simply allowing the player to move using WASD. Otherwise the puzzles are nicely integrated into the environments, the combat system is simple and rhythm based (which floats nicely with the sound design), and the twitter integration is completely optional allowing your experience to be as public or private as you want.\nSo now to the most important part of the EP, the sound. Superbrothers is quite literally the best sound designed game I have ever played. The tracks are memorable because of both their intricacy and connection to various areas we spend extensive time exploring within the game. Combat tracks are adventure tracks are bass filled and mesh extremely well with the timing based combat system. More esoteric tracks fit beautifully with the cut scenes and trigon collection moments. The music alone is moving, thematic, and overall excellently composed. And it doesn't end there; the sound effects in the game are excellent. Pounding waterfalls, light footsteps, water splashing, or logs falling Sword & Sworcery will provide you an immersive sound experience. So then to summarize\n\nPros:\n- relaxing and thought provoking storyline\n- breaking of the 4th wall\n- extremely detailed pixel art\n- highly varied environments\n- Puzzles and environment mesh well\n- Excellent OST\n- Excellent Sound Design / SFX\n- Non-invasive social media experience\n\nCons:\n- breaking of the 4th wall\n- Poorly appropriated controls hinder experience\n- Social media experience?\n\nNow for you completionists out there, I would not tell you not to give this one a go. Most of the achievements in the game can be collected by just playing the game, or doing 4th wall breaking things like setting forward your device clock. But there are a few more difficult ones. For instance you must use the megatome to kill 7 rabbits. This can be tricky due to the mechanic never being explained, but don't fret. You only have a few options at your disposal so it's not hard to figure out how to accomplish this. There is no completion bonus for this game, but it's also not that hard to complete so just sit back and enjoy it.  With all this in mind I guys this game a score of 8.3 out of 10 and a completionist rating of Finish it!\n","April 17","true","4.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The thing about it is that it does not feel retro at all, but particularly modern. The game was originally developed for touch devices, so the controls are a bit simplistic. It feels like a point and click adventure, although you are free to move around anywhere you like. However, the story it tries, and succeeds to convey is quite beautiful. You are a rather unknown adventurer starting a journey to retrieve a book. Not treasure, not a weapon crafted by gods or demons, but a book capable of giving you knowledge you require. It is your job to take that knowledge and venture on a journey with the book’s guidance in order to achieve the dream of becoming a hero. That journey is marvelous and wonderfully complemented by its atmospheric soundtrack composed by Jim Guthrie, the same person who wrote the soundtrack for Indie Game: The Movie. This game is one I recommend to anyone in search of a great 4-hour long quest.","June 28, 2014","true","5.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's uniqueness is what makes it so quirky and lets it stand out. Sometimes for the better, while other times being a bit frustrating.\n\nThis is an 8-bit style abstract puzzle-adventure, stylised like an album (if that's possible). You follow a lone warrior, as he meets new people in this strange wilderness, while trying to find some ancient tome to defeat an evil thingy. It all sets up pretty standardly.\n\nThe little surprises came from the sprinkled humour in the ways the warrior interacted with the environment, and the inner monologue that followed. The sarcasm, and style of speaking was reminiscent of a teenager talking to friends, as opposed to fantasy speak ("We were like groan not another fetch quest amirite?")\n\nControls were not entirely intuitive to figure out puzzles, mainly because this was primarily designed for the smartphone interface. You would come to a new area, and see a shining light, for example. The way in which you interact with it may be to click it, or attract other things to it, etc. This game doesn't go out of it's way to explain how to complete a puzzle, but rewards exploration. This could be frustrating for some, if you're like me who is sometimes impatient.\n\nThe minimalistic style is cool, and Jim Guthrie's atmospheric soundtrack fits in perfectly.\n\nOverall fairly simple and short, this game is good to spend a few hours in.","January 31, 2015","true","3.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It incorporates the soundtrack perfectly with the gameplay. Seeing the story and adventure unfold was very enjoyable. There's some surprisingly creepy moments, which is very impressive for a 2D sprite game. The characters you meet along the way are simple but somehow interesting. The dialogue is witty and fun.\n\nNow for the negatives. The game has a LOT of back-tracking, and by the end I was forcing myself to continue until the end. It can be very unclear what you need to do to proceed; at one point I had to check a guide to realize I had to summon a lightning bolt to crack a tree (the game never, ever hinted I needed to do this). There is a lot of aimless wandering as you try to figure things out. The combat is extremely basic, but to be fair that's not the focus on the game.\n\nI'm happy I played it, but it definitely stretched my patience at times. It took me about 3-4 hours to beat it in one sitting.\n","June 8, 2015","true","7.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

But that's not the point of Superbrothers. The game is about exploring if anything. With the help of the minimalistic but mesmerizing and authentic visuals and the truly fascinating soundtrack you get sucked into the unique world of Superbrothers.\n\nSuperbrothers uses a unique feature, where the position of the moon defines your ability to progress in the game. This is a fun feature, but you can always avoid it by changing the date on your computer should you be in a rush. I did run into an issue with this, as you can be blocked out of a certain part of the game (and achievement) when you play at a 'no moon' part of the cycle.\n\nIts story is one for the personal interpretation, so I dare not giving any details. However, if you are going to play this, take the time to chat with NPCs as well as reading your journal. The devil is in the details.\n\nThe true beauty of Superbrother is in the complete package. The graphics, the music, the sounds... allow yourself to get sucked into the dream... it'll be a good one.\n\nOne final tip, go for the #moar achievement.\n\n\n+ Masterful audiovisuals that complement each other\n+ Compelling storyline\n+ Original and unique\n+ Interesting moon-mechanics\n\n- Social media oriented ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t\n- Chance of missing out on content\n- Very little gameplay\n\n\n8 / 10","May 21, 2013","true","8.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This will be my third time playing it. I have a lot to say about it.\n\nIt's not quite a point-and-click adventure. It's not quite a hack and slash. It is a strange emotional experience, that is based in the fantastic but sprinkles in a bit of the mundane just to keep you grounded. It's a somewhat short game, but it demands you to space out your experience, even asking you to wait entire IRL moon cycles before progressing in some cases. In the first section of the game, the narrator will actually tell you that the first play session will tak you 15 or 20 minutes, and when you finish you will even be kicked back to the main menu just as encouragement to not play it all at once. I kind of wish more games did stuff like this, too many games are built for open-ended gaming sessions, but S:S&S parcels out the gaming experience in discrete amounts.\n\nThe strangely proportioned pixel art people might be a little off-putting at first, but it forces you to see them not as they look but as what they represent. And the music is excellent, and is incorporated into the gameplay and game events masterfully. The music will entice you, provoke you, threaten you, and calm you. Everything about this game is like falling into a trance.\n\nGameplay-wise, there aren't really any difficult puzzles, and the combat isn't too complicated (though sometimes those trigons will get the better of you). When you do mess up, the game punishes you swiftly but not harshly. When you lose a fight the worst that happens is that you have to regain your health and then try again. It feels a little odd playing this game with a mouse though, as it is very clearly intended for touch controls.\n\nThe story starts out intentionally vague. You play as a warrior referred to only as the Scythian, who was sent far from her home to complete a woful errand that somehow involves a book called the megatome. The dialogue is mainly related to you indirectly by the omnipotent narrator, who sometimes will appear in game to make an appearance just to break the fourth wall. In fact a lot of the dialogue and environments is just a little cheeky and breaks the fourth wall. There is twitter integration, but it's not very obnoxious and it's only referred to once in the beginning if you choose not to use it.\n\nDo I recommend this game? Absolutely. But with one caveat: if you have a touchscreen or tablet and a good pair of headphones, play it with that. You can get this on Android's Google Play Store, and probably on the iPhone app store as well. I played it on my phone, though I much prefer the way it looks on a full-sized monitor.","February 7, 2015","true","2.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This game has pretty pixel graphics, an amazing soundtrack, and a good puzzle system. While the combat isn't exciting or, well, anything much, it does add a bit of tension. The story is pretty narrative-based, so don't expect much dialogue. The music, being the thing that got me hooked, is amazing. Well-done with very solid tracks that I still eventually listen to, it is one thing that will get you gripped. The puzzles themselves are okay, but unless you go against what you're accustomed to in RPGs, you will find yourself looking for a guide.\n\nOverall?: 9/10.\n\nWell done artstyle mixed with a solid sense of wonder and passion in the dev's work, this game, and its free soundtrack included, will keep you hooked all the way through.","February 9","true","1.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Let's give it a listen.\n\nWell, dude, before we listen we need to think about what we are listening to. Superbrothers from a story perspective, follows the riveting and sacrificial journey of a warrior woman who isn't from around Migmi Taw. She has to place together esoteric constructs in order to defeat a dark force. In short, it's a tragic hero's journey through and through, but with a twist. During loading screens and within certain objects the game's administrator breaks the forth wall reminding us that we are playing a thought experiment with a twitter overlay. Overall the plot of this game maybe isn't moving or entirely grounding in solid logic, but it is very relaxing. It's a story that you will find yourself slowly slipping into just enjoying, even if you don't quite understand it all. In short, Superbrothers is thought provoking, complex, but most importantly just casually enjoyable. Compounding on that relaxing story line is the game's stellar presentation. The creators went the route of a beautifully detailed pixel art style and holy crap does it impress. Environments are vibrant and varied, begging you to explore every single inch. You'll move from a concert to a forest to a massive monolith in mere moments. Not to mention the environments show you how to solve the puzzles given to your character, which means you never feel completely lost or stuck. From a battle design standpoint, these locals are made for exploration and variable atmosphere not combat. Still no location in the game traps you into combat without giving you a chance to ready yourself, meaning that you won't die and flip a table. The game play in Sword & Sworcery is really the only major weak point in the experience. Originally developed as an IOS application, the game's touch screen control system has been poorly appropriated to its PC counterpart. So many aspects of puzzle solving, combat, and movement can feel uncomfortable due to the constant feeling that you’re moving too slow or that your keyboard is uncomfortable. It greatly detracts from the experience on the whole and it's a complete shame, since it could have been fixed by simply allowing the player to move using WASD. Otherwise the puzzles are nicely integrated into the environments, the combat system is simple and rhythm based (which floats nicely with the sound design), and the twitter integration is completely optional allowing your experience to be as public or private as you want.\nSo now to the most important part of the EP, the sound. Superbrothers is quite literally the best sound designed game I have ever played. The tracks are memorable because of both their intricacy and connection to various areas we spend extensive time exploring within the game. Combat tracks are adventure tracks are bass filled and mesh extremely well with the timing based combat system. More esoteric tracks fit beautifully with the cut scenes and trigon collection moments. The music alone is moving, thematic, and overall excellently composed. And it doesn't end there; the sound effects in the game are excellent. Pounding waterfalls, light footsteps, water splashing, or logs falling Sword & Sworcery will provide you an immersive sound experience. So then to summarize\n\nPros:\n- relaxing and thought provoking storyline\n- breaking of the 4th wall\n- extremely detailed pixel art\n- highly varied environments\n- Puzzles and environment mesh well\n- Excellent OST\n- Excellent Sound Design / SFX\n- Non-invasive social media experience\n\nCons:\n- breaking of the 4th wall\n- Poorly appropriated controls hinder experience\n- Social media experience?\n\nNow for you completionists out there, I would not tell you not to give this one a go. Most of the achievements in the game can be collected by just playing the game, or doing 4th wall breaking things like setting forward your device clock. But there are a few more difficult ones. For instance you must use the megatome to kill 7 rabbits. This can be tricky due to the mechanic never being explained, but don't fret. You only have a few options at your disposal so it's not hard to figure out how to accomplish this. There is no completion bonus for this game, but it's also not that hard to complete so just sit back and enjoy it.  With all this in mind I guys this game a score of 8.3 out of 10 and a completionist rating of Finish it!\n","April 17","true","4.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I'm just a sucker for pixel-art, it's crazy. That, and the game is just great. It's some sort of point-and-click adventure mixed with a couple of battles. The music is also done in a cool way and fits the game perfectly. Man, the music during the battles... don't get me started; it's lovely !\nI hear you ask; 'doesn't this game have any flaws then ?'\nUnfortunately, it does. The narrative isn't handled all that well, the game is quite short, and there's a lot of backtracking involved. Now, none of that really bothered me, but I do wish there were more locations. And some of the puzzles require a bit of pixel hunting. It would've been nice if they were handled in a different way (either make it more obvious or change the puzzle(s) altogether).\nStill, a very pleasant (and cheap) surprise !\n\n[Rating: 89/100]","May 3, 2012","true","3.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Sword and Sworcery enthralls you in a meditative ambience and aesthetic, only to pull you gently out of it with distinctly silly dialogue and tense moments. I feel as if I have something to fight for and I choose what and who I fight for it. Then there's the merry band of characters that charm you right from the get go. Logafellow is one of my favourite male characters in video game history.\n\nIt rewards curiosity, kindness and patience. If you're in a tense mood and need something fast paced, it's probably not the best time for Swords and Sworcery.

On paper it's a point-and-click adventure with some short rhythm-based combat sequences. In practice the puzzles require paying more attention to the music than to their logic, the storytelling is deliberately bizarre and less relevant than the overall feeling the graphics and music combined will give you. If you're looking for an actual game, with logic, content and progression then this game is not for you. If on the other you're looking for something you can enjoy over 3-4 nights, with the lights off and a good pair of headphones then it'll be a great experience.

I played through this on my iPad, but I have to say that the PC version is much more enjoyable to me so far. I think this is a game that is best enjoyed when you're not on-the-go, so that is why I prefer the PC version. Seeing it on a bigger screen and hearing it with better speakers makes it much more immersive. It has one of the most unique art styles I have ever seen. The music is fantastic and I have been listening to the soundtrack frequently outside of the game. The story is intriguing. In short, this is a masterpiece and well worth the 4-5 hour play-through if you can accept the strangeness and just try "feel" the game and the music. They put a lot of emotion into it. Oh, and use a nice pair of headphones if you have access to some.\n\nPros:\n*Even though it's a point-and-click adventure game, you get a little sword fighting/blocking action which is great in my opinion.\n*Music! Awesome feel.\n*Art style is very unique and beautiful.\n\nCons:\n*Not much replay value, but for a low price that's not much of an issue for some people.\n\n9/10","June 8, 2014","true","4.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ElusiveOne/recommended/204060/","ElusiveOne","ElusiveOne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ElusiveOne/","71 products in account","Sword & Sworcery features a female warrior on a quest to reunite triangles lost in a mysterious fantasy realm located somewhere between dream and reality. The intriguing story is divided into three increasingly long sessions, each briefly presented by monologue from The Archetype, with a shorter final one acting as a sort of conclusion.\n\nVery appealing and well executed pixel art embodies artistic simplicity met with astounding precision and remarkable sensitivity. Simple but fluid animations infused into every corner of the world, along with subtle color shifts that gracefully enhance the liveliness of the scenes, create a mesmerizing environment unlike any other.\n\nA solid soundtrack suits the mood perfectly, composed mostly of rock-tinged retro ambient ballads, properly extravagant mood trips, doom and gloom, and a wealth of high quality atmospheric sounds.\n\nDishearteningly and despite all the game does exceptionally well, there is too much to loathe about everything done wrong, or too peculiar to be enjoyable. Every time it surprised me with an awesome moment, of which there are a good few, it had to immediately remind me of its many glaringly frustrating elements.\n\nSword & Sworcery's totally awkward controls, obviously initially created for touch devices, do not play well in a mouse configuration, despite efforts made to ease the transition. Almost every design decision taken by the developer seems counter intuitive or ergonomically inefficient. Thankfully simple hints pop up from time to time to explain the more cryptic expectations.\n\nDreadful combat sequences require learning unavoidable patterns and hitting one of two buttons at the right moment, often with no clear consequence until repeated exposure. Later combat sequences can only be described as cheap rhythm games akin to playing ping pong. And waiting. Battles are exceptionally long for surprisingly so little action, as most of the time is spent waiting for a cue. Fights are so unequivocally counter-intuitive that an explanation comes after each failed attempt in the game's Megatome, a sort of encyclopedia chronicling important characters' personal thoughts.\n\nThe same boring and uneventful fights keep re-happening fairly frequently, without actual rewards, presumably to artificially extend playing time.\n\nThere are some funny and/or clever bits of dialogues and descriptions, though it eventually becomes banal to read blurbs drenched in juvenile hipster crass hidden among rare gems. Despite the intriguing setting and the very charming characters, the whole affair reads like an aspiring author's collection of best attempts at mystic alliterations and esoteric one-liners.\n\nMost Sworcery puzzles mainly consist in (optionally) ingesting magic mushrooms to see specific parts of the environment lit up, then figuring out in which pre-determined order the game expects you to click to release sylvan sprites. I found no logic to these segments most of the time, so it turned out to be tedious guesswork for the more obtuse ones and deceivingly simple otherwise.\n\nParts of the game accurately synchronize with the actual moon's phases, marking one of the game's most unique and truly original ideas. Fortunately, the developers realized that being able to play entire sections of their game only once a month at full and new moons was a spectacularly bad proposition, and they built a way to temporarily alter the phases of the moon directly in the game, essentially circumventing the entire feature's purpose and value.\n\nA few other minor flaws and annoyances include the main character constantly referring to herself in the second person, completely useless Twitter integration on every single line, slow character movement, and too often self-referential for its own benefit.\n\nThis game offers a beautiful world in which I would love to get lost for hours, if only it offered anything worthwhile to do. As it stands, its long list of frustrating elements far outweigh everything else I so desperately loved.\n","November 24, 2015","false","5.6"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

It feels like a stripped down version of rpg combat. The game has you progress by walking SLOWLY between areas solving the same tedious puzzles over and over again, just to obtain these 3 triangles called trigon pieces. The overall game was not very fun, from slow walk speed, to tedious puzzles, a predictable story, to banal combat. The moment when I stopped was after obtaining the 2nd trigon piece and having the game say that in order to obtain the last piece I had to wait real world days for the next full moon.

Especially if your personality is akin to that of a differently-abled llama.\n\nThe pixel art is great, no doubt. However the scenery soon becomes repetitive and the initial charm of the landscapes diminishes.\nThe clunky, unintuitive contols frustrate often. In particular, a chase scene quickly goes from tense and urgent to mouse-throwingly-irritating. As you try to escape, your mouse clicks "grab" the screen, dragging the scene in the opposite direction of the one in which you were attempting to move. Throw in the painfully glacial pace of your protagonist and navigating this lovely low-res world becomes a chore. Essentially the gameplay itself is pinned upon almost a singular mechanic, initiating "scorcery mode" and activating the environmental surroundings through mouse clicks in a specific order to release Forest Sprites. It's simplistic at its core, but often obtuse. You may however consume mushrooms to highlight these specific points of interaction, but maybe 'shrooms is how we've ended up here in the first place.\n\nFor all the emphasis on the soundtrack or the "EP", the tunes here are generally uninspiring, background ambience. A grating bell-dong accompanies every scroll of on-screen text that feels quite unnecessary. Although, the grunts and cries of your protaganist during battle sound fierce and have a Link-like charm. There's also a rambling, awkward monologue from a character that was somewhat amusing.\n\nThe attempted casual, modern style of the text is an innovative idea, but feels forced. The word "super" is repeatedly thrown in front of adjectives, endevouring to be current.\nIn spite of all this, I found the choice of a female lead character to be a commendable one. It's just a shame she doesn't have more to do.\n\nThe parting announcement S:SS leaves you with- "Your woeful errand is at an end." Indeed... Indeed it is.\n\nSuper disappointing.","January 16, 2015","false","7.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

Having said that, I didn't especially enjoy this. It's decent enough, and certainly intriguing. I personally just found the control system somewhat cumbersome, and had a really hard time figuring ut what the heck i was meant to be doing most of the time. I don't mind games that leave you to figure stuff out on your own, but most of the time, I just ended up wandering about doing random things until something happened to progress, more by good luck than logically figured out.\nHaving said that, the good soundtrack and retro style graphics did apeal and kind of added to the otherworldly-ness (not sure if that's a word!) of the atmosphere. There wasn't anything particularly terrible about this game, but nothing particularly stood out about this, aside from the soundtrack. And, I confess, the link into the social media kind of felt more gimmicky than innovative.  would I recommend it? In all honesty, probably not. There are plenty of 'experimental' games out there which feel much more accessible than this, and manage to combine innnovative ideas and gameplay (Dear Esther, for example, or Shelter even are two that spring to mind). Full marks for effort, but a bit too inaccessible for me.","February 14, 2015","false","1.4"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/recommended/204060/","jocosity","Communist "Joseph Ballin" Layton","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/","920 products in account","Three years ago, I wrote a joke review for this game just saying "Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP is an indie game", with the joke being that it looked like the samey pixellated trash that was flooding the indie scene at the time. But now I actually got around to playing it, and I've found that it's actually exactly what I expected it to be.\n\nYou don't really do much in this game. Your goal in each area is to find the sprites "hidden" in the area, though they aren't particularly difficult to find. Then you do a quick "puzzle" ranging from things like sliding ducks to their mother to engaging in trial-and-error to find the correct sequence of clicking on trees. You do this a few times and then occasionally fight a boss that plays out kind of like the first Ganondorf fight from Ocarina of Time, where you deflect a missile attack back and forth until it hits it. You meet two characters along your journey and you can see their thoughts, along with your own, in the megatome (a magic book that you find early on), and they're interesting enough to not make you feel like you wasted time reading them but they rarely go beyond that level. The game disagrees, of course, and even if you tell it that you don't want to participate in its twitter functionality early on it's still going to put a tweet button beside every line of dialogue and constantly remind you that social media is going to play an important role in the game (spoilers: it doesn't, at least as far as I could tell).\n\nIf the controls were changed at all from the iOS version beyond letting you use your mouse, I couldn't tell. Almost everything is done by clicking and holding, or clicking and holding and sliding, and other things you would expect from a touch screen game. I didn't think it was possible to make a simple point-and-click interface unintuitive, but they've proved me wrong. You can move by either double clicking the area you want to move to or holding and sliding, but holding and sliding produces a constant humming sound that goes against the music, which is presumably the whole point of the game. The music is admittedly good, particularly one part where you can listen to the composer play the guitar while clicking on things in the environment to make your own rhythm alongside him, but a significant portion of it seemed to just be ambiance. It set the scene well, but it isn't something that I'd want to listen to outside of the game, though I'm not sure if that was the point or not.\n\nSo in the end, my review 3 years ago was probably better left unchanged anyways. In the time it took you to read all this you could've done something else that takes a minute or two to do, and you still probably wouldn't have touched this game either way for $8. Maybe we'd all be better off if I had never returned to Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP after all these years.","April 16, 2015","false","4.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/futome/recommended/204060/","futome","Claire✿","http://steamcommunity.com/id/futome/","322 products in account","Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP was an interesting game. ...But not interesting enough.\n\nAnd what I mean by that is through my complete playthrough of the game, the game felt like it was trying to convey a bigger thought. A bigger picture and a larger frame of imagination.\nWhat bothers me is the game conveys these thoughts but then suddenly ends when it felt like it needed to start show casing it's cloud of information and thoughts of enlightenment.\n\nIt was a pretty impressionable lacking feeling.\n\nThe world SB:S&S takes place in was one that felt like it had a substantial amount of lore and background, but you were just a watcher who commands a Scythian to complete a quest they called "A Woeful Errand" It felt like that besides the errand, the world it takes place in isn't extremely meaningful to you as you're there to guide the Scythian to complete her mission. So most lore can easily be ignored or you can make the Scythian get a little bit of background information from reading her thoughts on the world around her and talking to other people. I appreciate that is was natural and people weren't just flushing the worlds background out of them into you.\n\nThe game has an interesting way of connecting you to the characters involved in the game. Your character shortly after starting her errand aquires a book dubbed "The Megatome"\nThe Megatome allows you to see how many days until the next real life black moon or full moon. It also allows you to read the minds of others and establishes an interesting connection to people around you. Mind you, this function isn't gimmicky and isn't overdone. It's pretty simple but interesting.\n\nThis game is a point and click adventure without a doubt. It was released first on the IOS and then for PC. During my playthrough, i'd say it's a little better suited for the IOS. But it works pretty darn well on the PC too, so it is a pretty good port nonetheless.\nThe playing world is pretty narrow in-movement, but as far as what you need to do and exploring goes. The game respects your thoughts on where to go and what you should do. There is times where I got lost or tried to solve a puzzle in a area where there was no puzzle to be solved (by using the song of sworcery). But ultimately after maybe ten minutes at worst, i'd figure out where I needed to be and then they game kept moving.\nI appreciate that and the time loss isn't that bad, the only thing that will probably bother you about that is when you gotta hike all the way to where you need to be. The Scythians pacing can be a bit tiresome and annoying sometimes.\n\nThe art style of the game is pretty great. Sometimes I feel like it wasn't tied too strongly to the story, so sometimes the art styles impact fell kind of short when the story was uprising towards it approach to its climax.\nThough at-times the art and the colors and sounds mixed-in with what was happening helped achieve a state of artistic enlightenment and a different kind of view on things. ...Also getting high on the occassional in-game mushroom helped that out a bit sometimes.\n\nUnfortunately, the same can be equally be said about the music. The music was perfect in areas and it carried emotions out of me. Feelings of intensity, feelings of whimsical peaceful happiness and others.\nBut unfortunately as I said, there was times where the music felt really out-of-place or it was hard to understand what the music meant in-conjunction to the story or what was going on.\n\nThough that aside, the connections I grew with side characters and main characters was very nice. My personal favorite being the Grizzled Boor. I like how in the game the story isn't painfully linear. You actually may never even see the grizzled boor until the ending or there's other parts in the progression of the story where you may think that was just the story running its course. But not so, this helps build a level of replayability in the game. Though i'd say probably one or two playthroughs after the first, and you'll never play this game again most likely.\n\nThe combat system is pretty basic and unimportant, which is good since it's not really a meaningful compenent of the game in the first place. Though there was a time where a battle felt really tense unexpected and there was a time where I had to fight someone and I didn't want to hurt them in the first place.\nCombat is pretty sparse, and usually pops-up in places when you've gotten kind of sick of the scythians mundane pacing through the world.\n\nThat all aside, the game is a experience and a expression. They said it themselves that this game is an experiment (a social one (it encourages you to tweet things about the game)). I wouldn't really agree that it was a successful one or that they could get much data from their experiment, but it was still an okay test in my opinion. Though they needed to provoke more thought and stimulation of emotions in the game.\nAlso they not only called it a social experiment, but also a sound experiment. Shamefully that lacked at a good amount of points too (as explained earlier) and after the 3rd chapter, you'd consider the sound experiment something of a joke. It had its time when it was woven very eloquently, but it wasn't consistently often and done very well.\nPerhaps the most touching parts of the sound experiment was when I was awakening Sylvian Sprites and when I sent them to the heavens above you would hear a happy child giggling and the sky would lighten for a second. I honestly cherished those moments when I was awakening the spirits and the peaceful tranquil sounds they made as you tapped them touched my soul a little bit.\n\nSo ultimately, we arrive at the point. "Should you get this game?", and I say maybe.\n\nThrough the games pieces of lacking material and parts of confusion and changing wavelengthts of script quality.\nThere's parts and pieces of this game that are actually good, are things that need to be presented to the player.\nYou won't get much out of it if you don't think a little bit about some of the things in this game for a short bit after or even during the game.\n\nI'd recommend getting it on a picecut like I did though.","March 16, 2014","false","4.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Takarias/recommended/204060/","Takarias","[TRQI] Takarias","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Takarias/","253 products in account","S:S&S is a game that tries too hard.\n\nIts visual and audio style are both incredible, and the game is a joy to experience, but it quickly goes downhill once you start trying to actually do something.\n\nThe controls are the first thing that hits you. It becomes immediately apparent that this is an iPad game. 'Replacing touch with a mouse is clumy, but I can deal with that,' you say. And so you deal with it. The controls don't seem to get more intuitive, but at least they're workable.\n\nThen you get to a girl named Girl, and that seems quirky. And this quirkiness stays pretty consistent, which means it gets a little annoying. There's a g-man that says a bunch of big words that essentially mean nothing, a woodman that states the obvious, and a dog that barks. Whatever, you've seen iffy writing before, and you continue.\n\nBut then you realize that you're incredibly slow. Annoyingly so. Most of the game is spent waiting for your character to slowly meander across the beautiful pixel landscape. You can only explore an area the first time through, but this game will keep sending you back and forth through it. So you deal with it.\n\nThis slowness carries through to your interactions with things. Everything needs to be clicked and held, or maybe rubbed for a while. Or strummed or touched just right, or poked a few times.\n\nWhich brings us to the puzzles. If you can call them that. You click and hold on a thing (for a while,) then you have to interact with... something. Sometimes that something glows, sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes you need to slowly walk over to a mushroom and eat that first before you can see the thing you have to do something to. And once you figure out what you're interacting with, and how to interact with it, you have to divine what ORDER to interact with those things. I could find no rhyme, reason, or explanation to how this worked. It was pretty much just random clicking that eventually got me through.\n\n'But this game is rated Mostly Positive in user reviews!' you say. And yes, it is, so you keep going, thinking that there's gotta be something incredibly redeeming about this game.\n\nPerhaps this is so highly rated because it wallows in how artsy it is. Everything about this game is artsy. Yes, it's pretty. Yes, it sounds good. Yes, it's pretentious. But that doesn't make it good. Anyway, you think this, and continue on to...\n\nThe first boss. Now, combat up to this point has been pretty simple. There's been a wolf that you block attacks from, and it seems like you can't hit it, though it's never explained why not; and there was a statue or something that you blocked and then hit while it was stunned. That was actually pretty okay. But the boss? Oh no, it doesn't follow the few combat rules laid out up to this point.\n\nSo far, the player has been shown that you are capable of blocking god damn anything with your shield. So the boss betrays your trust with an unblockable attack. You fumble your way to finding the solution to this little problem and make it to the next step. Now the boss triggers an audio cue, at which point you tap the block button and dodge to the side. THIS IS NOT INDICATED OR USED UP TO THIS POINT. Until you dodge, you don't even know that dodging is a mechanic. This is terrible design.\n\nZelda gets blasted for overusing the new toy and throwing it away at the end of a dungeon. But do you know why they do that? The entire dungeon is spent training the player how to use said toy before offering a final test of the player's skill in the form of the boss fight. S:S&S throws this entire concept to the wind and throws random crap at you and laughs when you don't pick it up immediately.\n\nI think the boss is supposed to be beaten through trial and error, but 'trial and error' and 'figue out the new mechanic on the spot' are not the same thing. And since everything takes so damn long (the boss's first attack is over a minute after you triger it, every time,) it's really hard to keep pushing yourself through this encounter.\n\nI certainly didn't.\n\nAnd that is why I do not recommend this game. Maybe get the soundtrack and poke a Let's Play or something, because it's really pretty and sounds great.","July 17, 2015","false","1.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The puzzles were too easy and combat was lackluster and unchallenging, making it annoying and pointless to fight that shadow guy everytime you have to walk through the same pathway a millionth time. The writing was also irritating as it tends to make unnecessary self-commentary everytime something happens that takes away any meaning to the story in a shallow attempt to be funny. And let's not forget that annoying voice acting of Logfella when he tries to make awkward conversations with you; it's unfunny and out of character (no attempt to sound like an old woodsman and instead sounds like an awkward teenager) which loses any immersion to the game. Overall I liked the style of the game but gameplay mechanics and story were not good. Not worth the 2 dollars I spent on this game.","January 27, 2014","false","3.7"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","2"

Sword & Sworcery is an EP, not a game proper. It is music foremost and a storytelling experience second.\n\nDespite what you may think and hear, this game is far from pretentious, and one of few examples where people will point to when they say that games can be art. Here is one so accutely self-aware that it nearly transcends it.\n\nAt its base, Sword & Sworcery is a wacky adventure tied onto a pretty nifty soundtrack. It is an experiment in modern storytelling and game design. A fruitful experiment, infusing music with puzzles and battles and decidedly not vice versa. The visuals, as you can already tell, are beyond stunning.\n\nS&S is a game that tells its story almost in a sarcastic, tongue-in-cheek manner. At risk small of ruining the surprise, I will say this: it is exactly this silliness that both allows you to come even close to taking it seriously, and the cleverness that makes you appreciate it all the more.\n\nIf the plot were presented in a serious manner, few would take it seriously and it would just seem as pretentious and obfuscated as Braid. It is the humour and quirkiness of the title that makes the story penetrable at all. Despite the jests, the story is even more compelling if you take it as being honest.\n\nNow here's the sad bits: this is not meant for the PC at all. Find yourself a touch screen copy of this game. It is not meant to be completed in one or two sittings. You are meant to pace yourself and take it in chunks, and you'll be more likely to finish the game that way.\n\nMissing the ending is something you do not want to do. That is when everything sinks in.","June 2, 2013","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The soundtrack the soundtrack the soundtrack. Soundtrack? The. Soundtrack.\n\nSound Effects: I don't think I have ever commented on sound effects. I mean, voice acting, sure, but that to me is its own category. I also want to cater my chatter to the games themselves since oftentimes something stands out on its own and needs to be talked about. That said, the sound effects are crisp, elegant, real, magical. I think crisp is a delicious word; it makes me happy. Crisp. That was the first thing I thought of when I watched the Steam Release video. It carries throughout the game. Moments where there is little music are made vibrant by the sound effects. Not an "oh I hear birds, how realistic" or "oh the people in the distant market, I can hear them!" vibrancy. It goes deeper into an almost trance inducing simplistic beauty. It dances in your mind. It dances with your mind.\n\nStory: Simple. At least to me it wasn't terribly deep, but I admit that I didn't spend an enormous amount of time in the game. The writing is superb though. I was pulled into the mystery of the game mostly becasue I didn't feel I had to be playing the game to be a part of it. The story became part of my own. The woeful errand is mine.\n\nGameplay (A): The controls and actual gameplay are brutally straightforward and it works. I felt good about accomplishing things but it was more of an "Ah-ha! Got it!" feeling than an "I did it! I can't believe it! YEEEEAAAAHHHH!" feeling. That said, the last part of the game gives you the latter feeling.\n\nGameplay (B): The way it incorporates into life would have been more engaging if I used twitter. Still, this game got me to actually make a twitter account, so that was something. I haven't used twitter since, so...yeah. Anywho, even despite that element being wasted on this guy I found the way this ties into the real world to be the best thing ever. I am sure some people will think it is lame, but I loved it. I don't want to ruin it, you can always look it up if you want, but it is astronomy related. Nothing complex. Nothing you can't google your way into knowing. But I was enraptured.\n\nGraphics: Obviously not for everyone. I loved them. It manages to be pixel art while also being art. Not all pixel art games are terribly pretty, but this one is. Nostalgia doesn't even have much to do with it. It is an art style and I love what they have done with it.\n\nOverall: I bought it, obviously. I watched the release trailer and knew I had to. I am recommending it. I bought the soundtrack. I fell in love with the mystery and ambiance of this game. You could read a hundred reviews that say this is amazing and you may think it is insipid. I tend to buy indie and sale games that spark my interest. I love trying different games to find ones I like, but a lot of them I don't fall in love with and I am ok with that. If you want to invest some effort then look at my library, my reviews, and what I have spent time playing, then decide.","August 26, 2014","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Part of the game is figuring out how the interface works and how puzzles are supposed to be solved.  It's short, and I ran the range while playing it from thinking it was super simplistic to thinking the design aspect of it and the entire concept was transcendent brilliance, and then I was somewhat disappointed by a kind of abrupt ending that brought the game down a point or two for me.

I cannot forget how I sat at the campfire playing music and wondering how simple and beautiful it was.\nTalking about cons, some may be disappointed by the game length (but I do not consider this bad, as it feels right for the game), or may have issues with the control system, but these do not not outweight the pros about the game at all. Talking about the price, I do not hide that the current one (5.99 €) may have deterred me from buying it.

While the visual art and music are technically decent, they just kinda seem like the same ♥♥♥♥ we've seen over the last couple years with no real flavor. Other than the sheer size of the enviroments, nothing really stands out. AThe majority of the time is spent walking around very slowly around big ♥♥♥ environments. Some would call this building atmosphere, but without engaging mechanics or story or REALLY good visuals and sound it just becomes a bore.  Occassionally you get combat, which is simple block->counterattack fair that is a disgrace to the legacy of Punch-Out. Then there are the "puzzles" which boil down to find a couple hidden objects then click them in a vaguely rhythmic order. There's exactly one real puzzle that the achievements straight up tell you the answer to. The plot follows a bunch of characters that are never really developed on some quest we have no real stake in told through a narrator that sounds like some hipster who really likes Adventure Time. The big gimmick is the weird metaaspects of "The Archtype" telling you how to play the game and what you are supposed to be getting out of it, as well the ability to post ♥♥♥♥ you do to twitter and follow the in-game characters. This is just the sour prentious icing on the bland, mediocre cake. Maybe this ♥♥♥♥ was impressive on phones, but on the PC it just doesn't stand.","August 9, 2014","false","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While the visual art and music are technically decent, they just kinda seem like the same ♥♥♥♥ we've seen over the last couple years with no real flavor. Other than the sheer size of the enviroments, nothing really stands out. AThe majority of the time is spent walking around very slowly around big ♥♥♥ environments. Some would call this building atmosphere, but without engaging mechanics or story or REALLY good visuals and sound it just becomes a bore.  Occassionally you get combat, which is simple block->counterattack fair that is a disgrace to the legacy of Punch-Out. Then there are the "puzzles" which boil down to find a couple hidden objects then click them in a vaguely rhythmic order. There's exactly one real puzzle that the achievements straight up tell you the answer to. The plot follows a bunch of characters that are never really developed on some quest we have no real stake in told through a narrator that sounds like some hipster who really likes Adventure Time. The big gimmick is the weird metaaspects of "The Archtype" telling you how to play the game and what you are supposed to be getting out of it, as well the ability to post ♥♥♥♥ you do to twitter and follow the in-game characters. This is just the sour prentious icing on the bland, mediocre cake. Maybe this ♥♥♥♥ was impressive on phones, but on the PC it just doesn't stand.","August 9, 2014","false","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The soundtrack the soundtrack the soundtrack. Soundtrack? The. Soundtrack.\n\nSound Effects: I don't think I have ever commented on sound effects. I mean, voice acting, sure, but that to me is its own category. I also want to cater my chatter to the games themselves since oftentimes something stands out on its own and needs to be talked about. That said, the sound effects are crisp, elegant, real, magical. I think crisp is a delicious word; it makes me happy. Crisp. That was the first thing I thought of when I watched the Steam Release video. It carries throughout the game. Moments where there is little music are made vibrant by the sound effects. Not an "oh I hear birds, how realistic" or "oh the people in the distant market, I can hear them!" vibrancy. It goes deeper into an almost trance inducing simplistic beauty. It dances in your mind. It dances with your mind.\n\nStory: Simple. At least to me it wasn't terribly deep, but I admit that I didn't spend an enormous amount of time in the game. The writing is superb though. I was pulled into the mystery of the game mostly becasue I didn't feel I had to be playing the game to be a part of it. The story became part of my own. The woeful errand is mine.\n\nGameplay (A): The controls and actual gameplay are brutally straightforward and it works. I felt good about accomplishing things but it was more of an "Ah-ha! Got it!" feeling than an "I did it! I can't believe it! YEEEEAAAAHHHH!" feeling. That said, the last part of the game gives you the latter feeling.\n\nGameplay (B): The way it incorporates into life would have been more engaging if I used twitter. Still, this game got me to actually make a twitter account, so that was something. I haven't used twitter since, so...yeah. Anywho, even despite that element being wasted on this guy I found the way this ties into the real world to be the best thing ever. I am sure some people will think it is lame, but I loved it. I don't want to ruin it, you can always look it up if you want, but it is astronomy related. Nothing complex. Nothing you can't google your way into knowing. But I was enraptured.\n\nGraphics: Obviously not for everyone. I loved them. It manages to be pixel art while also being art. Not all pixel art games are terribly pretty, but this one is. Nostalgia doesn't even have much to do with it. It is an art style and I love what they have done with it.\n\nOverall: I bought it, obviously. I watched the release trailer and knew I had to. I am recommending it. I bought the soundtrack. I fell in love with the mystery and ambiance of this game. You could read a hundred reviews that say this is amazing and you may think it is insipid. I tend to buy indie and sale games that spark my interest. I love trying different games to find ones I like, but a lot of them I don't fall in love with and I am ok with that. If you want to invest some effort then look at my library, my reviews, and what I have spent time playing, then decide.","August 26, 2014","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While the artstyle is for the most part lovely, it still boggles my mind wondering where the praise for this has come from. The music isn't even particularly good. This may be listed as a recommendation, dear friend, but this is very much a warning.","June 3, 2012","false","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

While the game tries to convince you that its soundtrack is awesome, you'll be moving via double clicks through some of the most obvious adventure puzzling ever.  Very light action elements have you using Z and X on the keyboard to block and slash through the game's "fights," but you'll likely only die a handful of times if at all.  If you can't tell, I think this game is easy.  There is one real-world time based puzzle, but you can work around that a couple of ways if you are impatient.  Overall, I'd have a hard time NOT recommending you play this due to the fact that I enjoyed my time with it.

I can happily say that it was a bad mistake on my part, and that I recommend it.\n\nPlaying Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP has been a truly nice experience: as others said, the music, the art and the game itself have some peculiar quality that evoked in me a sense of wonder, and made me quite absorbed by the atmosphere of the game. I cannot forget how I sat at the campfire playing music and wondering how simple and beautiful it was.\nTalking about cons, some may be disappointed by the game length (but I do not consider this bad, as it feels right for the game), or may have issues with the control system, but these do not not outweight the pros about the game at all. Talking about the price, I do not hide that the current one (5.99 €) may have deterred me from buying it. Still, I find it a rather reasonable price for the experience this game offers.\n\n","July 25, 2014","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The interaction between puzzles and just getting around is well thought out and it keeps you on your toes. They took an interesting approach adding a feature to live tweet in the middle of the game, but what you're able to tweet can be quite entertaining. The visual effects are amazing differing from area to area and the overall disgust for rainbows is something to laugh at. Each character quickly builds their own unique personalities into the story which can cause you to care more about what they might have to say at each turning point. One can appreciate that breaks are recommended after you complete each act, giving you the opition to instantly turn the game off or continue right away. While the fighting system may grow dull, the story keeps you hooked in enough to bare through it. Lastly, the soundtrack is phenomenal. Being free to create your own sounds at certain points throughout the game, it helps to have well composed music that fits the mood in every scenario and is delightful to listen to on its own.\n\n9.5/10","May 19, 2014","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The player is thrown into a world s/he knows nothing about, in a game where the mechanics are not explained by some boring tutorial or lame on-screen directions. Instead, the game cleverly introduces concept little by little, nudging the player to understand. Doing all of this, without being frustrating or annoying, rather keeping the player intrigued to know more.  Also great for casuals as it is divided up into sections that seem to take 30-45 minutes.

It's blend of lush, beautiful pixel art, engrossing sound effects and score, and intuitve gameplay sets the bar for indie games several pegs higher.\n\nAlthough the gameplay mechanics are designed for touch-enabled devices, I had no issues using a mouse to click, drag, and strum my way though game. The combat system was probably easier on touch, but I only encountered a few mis-clicks in my five-and-a-half hour playthrough.\n\nI believe it would be very easy for someone to beat this game for the first time in four hours, but I managed to get turned around a few times, especially in Session 3. The characters generally guide you along well enough to your next goal, though the hints can be quite cryptic at times. When I did finally find my way again, it was only then that I realized the true meaning.\n\nAt its core, the indiekid/hipster vibe of this game will either make or break the experience for you. The vocal tracks, few and far between, remind me of more of a spaced-out Bill and Ted than one would expect from a game, and both the developers and sound/music guy Jim Guthrie managed to have cameos. I found these traits endearing, the final polish on an already unblemished game.

It's more of an experience? The main focus is not the game itself but the pixel art and the clever use of sound and music. The music always matches the mood of the action giving you upbeat and epic tunes during battles and soft ambient tunes during exploration. In fact, battles were my favorite parts of the game (though there were few). They battles are simple patterns of attack and defense but they still prove to be fun and sometimes a bit intense.\n\nWhile there are some definite good aspects of this game, there are other aspects that have me torn and make this game somewhat difficult to recommend. First of all, when playing this game, you have to remember that it was intended for mobile devices and tablets. I didn't understand that at first and was instantly frustrated with the controls. Touching and tapping has been replaced with mouse controls. It's still a bit confusing but you get used to it. My second gripe is that you as a player have very little idea of who your character is, what she is doing, and why (you understand more towards the end but for most of the game, you will be confused). It's important to check your surroundings, interact with characters, and listen to what they say (though they can be deliberately cryptic at times). This bring me to my next complaint... This game works fine, it looks good but there was something that kept bothering me and I couldn't quite figure it out until a couple of other users pointed it out in their own reviews. The game feels pretentious. Something about the overall presentation... The flashing of the game's title every now and then in-game, the flowery language of the archetype narrator, the fact that your character is known a "The Scythian" while other characters get names like "Logfella"... It's difficult to place the blame on one aspect but something is not quite right about this game's overall atmosphere.\n\nOverall, this is not a bad game. And maybe I'm wrong and this atmosphere was not the intention of the game's developers. So if you're into point-and-click, adventure, and music type things... Then give Sword & Sworcery a try and decide for yourself. It's a unique experience that you won't find elsewhere.","May 24, 2015","false","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game does not overstay its welcome and does an excellent job of setting the player on a vague adventure through a forest where they must find magical triangles for no clearly defined purpose. This game's humor is extremely self-aware, and is often juxtaposed by the game's sense of epic art direction. Speaking of the art, it's hard to hide that this game uses a sprite based style that is actually more impressive than you might first think. Animations are extremely fluid, and you'll find yourself captivated by pixel art that looks fairly mediocre in stills yet springs to life in motion.\n\nMore important than anything else is this game's atmosphere and theme. This game has a wonderful soundtrack that plays many nature-inspired tunes while you walk around solving nature-inspired puzzles in your quest to find the magical Trigon. It's a difficult feeling to describe, which is why I have to recommend feeling it firsthand. There's something very earthy about the way this game presents itself.\n\nHowever, if I had to find pick one gripe about this game it'd be the "Moon Mood" system in Session III. Regardless of how you decide to manipulate this game to utilize it, a gameplay-based way and system manipulation-based way", the process is tedious and puts an unnecessary damper on the game's overall pace. However, it is a minor gripe when the rest of the game is so captivating.\n\nOverall it's extremely easy to recommend this game. If you're looking for a relaxing puzzle-adventure game with an excellent soundtrack this is an easy must buy!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/giantcommunistrobot/recommended/204060/","giantcommunistrobot","Carlos Danger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/giantcommunistrobot/","108 products in account","I had pretty high expectations for this game and it mostly delivered.  The gameplay itself is pretty basic: movement is done by double clicking a place on the screen and combat has only two buttons (attack or block).   Most of the odd controls are due to the game being an iOS port, but beyond the odd phrasing of the tutorial the controls are pretty decent.  The game gets better when it starts giving you puzzles: early on you unlock the power to "sing" and can interact with the environment to progress.  Mostly this boils down to clicking on the screen like a maniac until you figure out the order of things to press but there are few times where the game actually surprises you beyond the cookie-cutter puzzles that are introduced at the start of the game.\n\nHowever, the story more than makes up for the decent gameplay.  The game presents you with a fairly original fantasy universe where most of the lore is told in the background.  Once you finish the first act, you gain access to a device that allows you to see what other characters think about the events going on; this gives more lore and occasionally hints about how to progress.  Our universe's lingo mixes in occasionally: words like "upload" find their way into the dialogue and help create a mix of fantasy and contemporary.  The game surprised me with its unique sense of humor as well; the game is narrated in first person and this often leads to humorous self-revelations.  The game is a visual treat with its stylized and elongated pixel characters and rich backgrounds.  Of course the music is also incredible: the game was made with the music in mind and it shows.\n\nThe game took me around 4.5 hours, which is decently long for a cheap indie game.  It doesn’t lend itself to be replayed, although there are a few easter eggs you may miss on your first run through.  The game splits itself into 4 parts; the third part notably takes a whole lunar month to complete (unless you are a cheater).  I suggest you follow the game’s recommendation to take a break between acts; it helps break the sometimes repetitive gameplay.  Overall, it’s worth the asking price and is for sure a buy if it goes on sale for $5 or less.","May 3, 2013","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I bought it with the Humble Bundle V. I never thought to play it until now since I was sort of off put by the intentionally pixelated graphics. At first I thought, "hey this game isn't so bad, it feels like a sort of DMT-zelda". Then I realized, it literally is a terribly designed zelda game on acid with pretty music and admittedly well done graphics.\n\nThe game is pretty minimalistic for PC, which only made more sense when I discovered it's an ipad game. And yet, the character dialogue basically hammers you in the face with "THIS IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO SAY WIHTOUT SUBTLETY." The dialogue seems like it was written by two hipsters part way through their degrees at Evergreen, too. Don't use "mirite?" in a dialogue, EVER.\n\nThere's one part where the game's narrator tells you that the game's built-in twitter functionality (kill me now) may or may not play some role in one act, while the FAQ I was following said it does not. The game not only berates you time to time to tweet inane things that are happening which no one would get in the first place, but blatantly #lies to you in order to get you to advertise their game for free. For shame.\n\nThe part that really drove me over the edge was a puzzle that involves actually waiting a week (or more!) for the right time to continue the story. ♥♥♥♥ this. I play games on my own time, not the developer's. The FAQ's solution was to change the date/time on my computer to fool the game (which then labels you as a cheater and makes it impossible to get a 100% rating). I tried moving the date by one day for a week both forwards and backwards from my current day with no result. What a waste of time. I've never been pushed to the edge to just straight up quit a game forever before.\n\nThis game feels like an okay concept that was then designed by people who have a huge ego and a bizarre idea of what a game should be. I really can't believe this was bundled alongside Bastion, Limbo, Amnesia, and Psychonauts. Abysmal.","February 8, 2014","false","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In fact any attempt to make this a chill game goes out the window with the frustration of just trying to walk 4 feet.  Sometimes you click and walk, sometimes just a meaningless black circle floats there, making you ask the game "What the hell do you want from me?  WALK!"\n\nThe descriptions of things, in an attempt to be hip, come across as lazy and condescending.  A game with 4-bit graphics should put some actual effort into verbal descriptions.\n\nThe Good:\nUnlike most games that talk about the soundtrack as part of their description, this game really does have an absolutely killer soundtrack.  Atmospheric as hell.  In fact the entire atmosphere of the game is pretty enjoyable.  The kind of low budget yet immersive game that is fun to check out, and that I'd like to see more of.\n\nAnd also, it's cheap and short, so worth a look.","February 3, 2014","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The interaction between puzzles and just getting around is well thought out and it keeps you on your toes. They took an interesting approach adding a feature to live tweet in the middle of the game, but what you're able to tweet can be quite entertaining. The visual effects are amazing differing from area to area and the overall disgust for rainbows is something to laugh at. Each character quickly builds their own unique personalities into the story which can cause you to care more about what they might have to say at each turning point. One can appreciate that breaks are recommended after you complete each act, giving you the opition to instantly turn the game off or continue right away. While the fighting system may grow dull, the story keeps you hooked in enough to bare through it. Lastly, the soundtrack is phenomenal. Being free to create your own sounds at certain points throughout the game, it helps to have well composed music that fits the mood in every scenario and is delightful to listen to on its own.\n\n9.5/10","May 19, 2014","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yeah, it's a mobile game ported to PC and that does mean it isn't technically flawless. But man, I remember staying up in a room with no air conditioning in the middle of summer playing it and being like...two hours late for something because I wanted to finish this in one sitting.  I think I was meeting Mike for something. Mike, I'm sorry.\n\nOn the whole it's a really well made and fun adventure game that does a fantastic job at telling its story in a world that's filled to bursting with mysterious and enticing tone. The whole experience is truly evocative; a quest that will somehow lead you straight to peril, a la Shadow of the Colossus. The story itself is compelling and the game does a wonderful job of doing as much storytelling through the beautifully realized environments and haunting sound design as it does through actual text.\n\nAnd here's the cool thing about that. Sword and Sworcery swings almost all of its weight in those departments to create an engrossing experience. Why do I care about the world? Because it's simultaneously beautiful and enticing, it beckons for you to explore it. How do I know it's not just goofy? Because the music and the design of each area inform you of the mood there, you can tell when you're supposed to chuckle and when you're supposed to be on edge. Why do you press on? Because it looks like a quest-y video game, what else would you do?\n\nWhere does it fall apart? That's why I want you to play it. Personally, I think the narrator breaking things up is a bit to cheeky for the tone of the game (at least as I remember it almost a year later). Yeah, some of the combat controls are a little wonky, yeah the movement can be a teeny bit frustrating. But really, I want you to play this. I want you to understand what good design is: bringing all aspects of the experience together to create something that you want to spend time with, characters you feel for even if you don't know them well, and provide you with a story that you remember vividly enough to tell your little nephew at a camping trip 6 months after finishing it. It'll provide you with that wide-eyed childlike joy of exploration and the bittersweet joy of completion.\n\nIf this does convince you to buy the game, message me after it's done. I want to talk about it. So bad.\n\n","June 22, 2014","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While this would look better on say my PS Vita, it is a little pixelated on my iMac at 2560x1440 resolution.  The game is presented in pixel art form at it's best and has a very unique look and charm to it.  The music is great and is the best part of the game.\n\nThere is some combat, but it's not great.  It serves it's purpose.  Some people's reviews stated there wasn't much to do, but it's not that bad.  It's a small adventure (so far), but I have a feeling it will become a larger one once I get deeper into the game.\n\nCompleting the first session was fun and I am only 17% done with the game.  It took about 30 minutes and I didn't go everywhere I could.  The story was cool and I suspect it isn't over yet!  I think I just opened a can of worms so to speak! lol\n\nAnyway, I got this on sale so I can recommend buying it at sale price, but I am not sure about full price yet… I'll let you know when I finish the game! :-)  So far it runs great and have not had any problems on my iMac! :-)\n\nHere are my system specifications: iMac, i5 Quad-Core Intel processor 3.1GHZ, AMD Radeon HD 6970M with 1GB dedicated video RAM, 4GB system RAM, 1TB hard drive running OS X version 10.6.8, Journaled HFS+ Extended file system.","July 2, 2014","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The art direction is both bizarre and beautiful, and the soundtrack is one of the best I have ever heard in gaming. The story is so simple yet insanely deep, and the ending is one to think about for a long time. Although it is a short 4-hour campaign, it is very much a deeper game than the majority of AAA games on the market. Superbrothers is just plain brilliant.\n\nBut on the flip side, the controls are pretty bad on PC/Mac. Unfortunately, the game was original designed and released on iOS, and it suffers in transition. Moving the screen around, zooming in and zooming out, and combat are all much more complicated with the mouse than with touch screen.\n\nBut despite the bad controls, this is very much a worthy investment and one of the most unique and powerful indie games I have ever played. Definitely a recommend!","July 3, 2014","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've played it for 4 hours or so. The game is a rpg/fantasy game that really emphazises on atmosphere with it's original sounds and tones. You don't feel like you're playing a game, you feel like you are part of a dream, the music and art are that good. The combat and "boss" battle are nothing crazy, you can also feel that the game was made for iphones/ipads to begin with.

This can lead to an epic battle digressing to a show down with your mouse and the two button battle mode instead of the in-game enemy.\nOutside of this issue the aesthetic balance between the game's graphics and sound is amazing. The sound pairs with the actions you preform in the game enviroment so readily that you experience a whole new dynamic to the gameplay rarely felt in games; where sound becomes as stirring an emotional influence as the visuals. Many of the scenes are so well crafted that the sound effects of enemies, or even your own actions, blend seamlessly into the music giving the impression of perfect symmetry between player and game as even your own decisions occur seemingly in perfectly harmony with the soundscape.\nIt has been a long time since a game enviroment has engrossed me to the extent that video games did in my early childhood taking me on epic adventures and journeys. Play Sword and Sworcery for the good laughs from the offbeat humor and the musical crescendo of nostalgia that is its classic story line.","December 27, 2013","true","11.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its a point and click adventure game that features a female protagonist known as The Scythian. Like most Adventure games, you are required to click around to solve puzzles, explore amazing locales and unlock the secrets that lie within. Within what? Find out for for yourself.\n\nWhat I like about the game is the pixilated style that reminds me of PC games from the past like King's Quest, etc., etc. The characters in the game are fairly simple but pretty likeable. Their names pretty quirky and simple  like "Logfella", "Dogfella" or just plain "Girl". It the design of the game is so neat to look at that it feels like you can just stay here forever and just look at all the pixel art and how smooth it looks.\n\nTo accompany the pixel art is the music. My god the game boasts a mean soundtrack, composed by Indie Game: The Movie's own Jim Guthrie whose sound will make you want to "believe", as they say in the trailers. I swear the music in the game is so fantastic that I went to their official website and bought a vinyl disc of their soundtrack. It's that great.\n\nThere are some flaws to the game though, one which regards to the length of the game. In truth the game could be about 3-5 hours long but the developers made the decision to  lengthen that out to what may take months instead. Without spoiling, I will say you will come back to the game each day to find out if it's the right time to progress the story. You might miss it if you wait too long and have to wait.\n\nI recommend this game to any fan of Point and Click Adventure fans. I believe its very worth it.","April 13, 2014","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game excels mostly in its audio and visuals. The game looks fantasic. The stylized sprites look great and really look smooth in their animations, not to mention the beautiful environments that are augmented by some great lighting. The audio is even better. This game features a soundtrack that is beyond great. The music fits perfectly with each scene and transitions are seemless making the soundtrack is worth listening as a stand alone experience. Even the voice acting and dialog are great. The dialog is witty and the VA adds a little extra spice when it is rarely used.\n\nThis game is a great experience for the price and time.","July 15, 2013","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The player is thrown into a world s/he knows nothing about, in a game where the mechanics are not explained by some boring tutorial or lame on-screen directions. Instead, the game cleverly introduces concept little by little, nudging the player to understand.

It's blend of lush, beautiful pixel art, engrossing sound effects and score, and intuitve gameplay sets the bar for indie games several pegs higher.\n\nAlthough the gameplay mechanics are designed for touch-enabled devices, I had no issues using a mouse to click, drag, and strum my way though game. The combat system was probably easier on touch, but I only encountered a few mis-clicks in my five-and-a-half hour playthrough.\n\nI believe it would be very easy for someone to beat this game for the first time in four hours, but I managed to get turned around a few times, especially in Session 3. The characters generally guide you along well enough to your next goal, though the hints can be quite cryptic at times. When I did finally find my way again, it was only then that I realized the true meaning.\n\nAt its core, the indiekid/hipster vibe of this game will either make or break the experience for you. The vocal tracks, few and far between, remind me of more of a spaced-out Bill and Ted than one would expect from a game, and both the developers and sound/music guy Jim Guthrie managed to have cameos. I found these traits endearing, the final polish on an already unblemished game.

You can sometimes tell where you're supposed to go by reading people's thoughts, but other times it's rather pointless. It's something different, and very interesting, but something that you'll play once or twice before never touching again or finding a guide.","July 12, 2012","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
