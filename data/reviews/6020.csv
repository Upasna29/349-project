In the file write the following, (the autoexec file is read from bottom to top for some reason).\n\nseta r_mode -1\nseta r_customaspect 1\nseta r_customwidth 1920\nseta r_customheight 1080\n\nset g_sabermorerealistic 2\nset helpusobi 1\n\nOnce that is done you should see it show up like this in the gamedata/base folder\nhttp://i.imgur.com/szG45Aj.png\n(notice how the Type for the autoexec shows up as CFG file and not a text file, this is also where you dump .pk3 files to get mods to run)\n\nThis is my autoexec for reference, it has a few more tweaks and i play at a laptop resolution because im currently on a laptop.\nhttp://i.imgur.com/6YnU2M0.png\n\nNow you can enjoy maximum dismemberment and the absolute best lightsaber combat in the history of video games at your desired resolution. I would suggest not touching the in game resolution settings while playing, the other options are fine though.\n\nOne of my favorite games of all time, enjoy it the right way.","November 28, 2015","true","54.5"," 686 of 704 people (97%) found this review helpful 37 people found this review funny","97","686","704","37","43"

Like Team death match, Death Match, Duel 1vs1 2vs2 4vs4 and alot more of  gamemodes,  The best gamemode: may be the Storyline game mode which focus on example jedies and Rebels has to storm a base and take down example the guns and Radars and the main core that controls the base. and a few more things.  A round can be very long and fun (based on how fast you and your team are to clear the way and destroy the targets).\nFor me the graphics are wonderful i normally  remap everything with HD texture but this game doesn't need it at all. It's wonderful and if your a star wars fan you wont regret you bought it.","December 8, 2013","true","30.4"," 165 of 173 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","165","173","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/onceinathousandyears/recommended/6020/","onceinathousandyears","TreiseV","http://steamcommunity.com/id/onceinathousandyears/","364 products in account","Have you ever wanted to be a Jedi? The Force isn’t strong enough in real life for you to be one? Well then, this game is good enough to satisfy that need. If you never wanted to be one, then this game will show you its charm anyway and afterward, you’ll fall in the former category. Despite its outdated look,  the gameplay is engaging and the story has the SW charm to it. This game has the original trilogy’s atmosphere, but it has more action.  Despite its predecessor, the level design won’t get you lost and there is less linearity, as you can select your gender, race, lightsaber fighting style and its shape and choice you make in the (near)end, whether to stay in the light or give into the dark and the consequences feel strongly(the protagonists attitude changes, some die, some get hurt, everything is awesome). There are some great moments for a Star Wars fan, such as fighting alongside Chewbacca, force choking Boba Fett, or taking a station down with Wedge Antilles.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=388457539\nThe gameplay involves lightsaber fighting(this is what made the Jedi Knight series famous) that inspired the combat of Blade Symphony, as there are many duels. Aside from those instances, chopping arms and heads of stormtroopers that actually can aim is really entertaining.  Jumping on walls, then on your adversaries is a good example of how fluid the combat can be. There are three types of force powers: light sided ones,  which involve sustaining health by healing and protection, and turning your enemies into allies, the universal ones like force push, pull, speed, sense and lightsaber throw and there are the dark sided ones, which are damaging and risky, as you’ll enter modes that strengthen you while draining your health, exposing yourself with force choke or force lightning, though the latter, when upgraded to its zenith, means pushing everyone out of the room while having bolts all over them.  You also have an arsenal of weapons to your disposal, that have primary and secondary types of firing.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=392988676\nThe story has its charm, as you start up as a student and end up being a Jedi Knight, there are many iconic characters and there is Kyle Katarn, the hero of the other Jedi Knight games.  The plot isn’t really intriguing, but it has its mystery. 80% of the game you’ll be doing missions that don’t seem to be related to the plot, but more to being a Jedi, that is keeping the peace in the Galaxy.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=405760786\nThe game last for about 8 hours, provided you tend to be alive most of the time. For Star Wars fans it’s a treat and some don’t exaggerate when they call it the best Star Wars game; while it’s a matter of taste, this game ends up on being on the favorites list. For newcomers, it’s enough to make them understand why people go crazy over Star Wars. The game isn’t complex, but is good enough to spend time with it and enjoy doing so.\n","March 10, 2015","true","16.9"," 154 of 163 people (94%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","94","154","163","25","3"

UPDATE THIS GAME I HAVE FIGURED OUT WHY THIS DOESN'T WORK FOR SOME PEOPLE, IT IS NOT COMPATABLE WITH WINDOWS 10 IT WILL JUST SAY IT HAS STOPPED WORKING.  SAME THING HAPPENS WITH JEDI KNIGHT 2: JEDI OUTCAST. HEED MY WARNING IF YOU HAVE WINDOWS 10 DO NOT GET UNTILL THEY FIX IT SOMEHOW. (if they can even fix that.)  That has actually been fixed thanks to some friendly people who told me how.  Type in http://sourceforge.net/projects/gldirect/ and there is a dowload (make sure to press the right dowload button, ads that have download buttons,) then in your file explorer where all your dowloads go you want to go to your os then programs *86 then in that folder go to steam then steam apps then go into the common folder find your game folder then go into the game data folder.  Now with the gldirect thing you downloaded you want to extract it then when it's done extracting go into that folder then gldirect5 then go into the bin folder then release folder then it's there, now you want to move that in your game data file that you did earlier. Now you are able to play one of the greatest star wars games ever made.\nPS. i forgot to mention that customizing your character is a little glitchy at least it was for me, and it will crash if you go windows D while playing the game then trying to get back into the game so don't forget to save, you should save in this game often.  Also Jedi knight 2 Jedi outcast has the same problem and this fixes it also.

With Kyle Katarn we needed to struggle through a couple of levels until we could, finally, get our hands on a lightsaber. Now, Jedi Academy completely skips these few levels. You are, already, a Jedi and in possession of a lightsaber. Make no mistake: the same array of shooting weapons are available, personally, however, I never used any.\n\nI liked this concept. In fact, at the beginning a few customisations are available: you can pick your race, the colour of your clothing and - most importantly - the colour of your lightsaber. Many missions can now be completed in the desired order but once you continue the main storyline it is, of course, the same old linear storytelling.\n\nThe game runs on the same Quake 3 engine and - as already mentioned - has the same assortment of weapons available at your disposal. However, since it is soooooooo cool to wield lightsabers we now have the option to 1) have two lightsabers at the same time or 2) use the lightsaber staff Darth Maul had in Phantom Menace. Of course, the single lightsaber option is still available with the 3 stances already offered in Jedi Outcast.\n\nThere is not much else to say about Jedi Academy. Fighting with lightsabers has never been cooler and the game heavily emphasizes this concept. The game gives us a long-lasting experience and I heard multiplayer is even better! Do note that enabling the widescreen option requires some tweaking - do head over to wsgf.org for the solution.","October 12, 2014","true","8.7"," 114 of 118 people (97%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","97","114","118","3","1"

Arthur","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FinnVArthur/","145 products in account","TL;DRA classic game set in the classic universe. This is a must play not only for the Star Wars fans.\n+ Magnificent and balanced combat system\n+ Choose your style: single, dual, or a sabrestaff\n+ Variety of guns\n+ Use the Force, Jaden!\n+ The protagonist doesn't have to be a human :)\n+ Option of choosing between the light and the dark side\n+ Soundtrack\n+ MULTIPLAYER\n+ Tons of player-created content\n- Plot isn't an A+ material (but it's not bad by any means)\n\nREVIEW\nIt's a blast from the past – still fun after all these years. The game tells us the story of the Jedi struggling to prevent the Cultists from resurrecting Marka Ragnos – an ancient Dark Lord of the Sith.\n\nThe protagonist, unlike in most of the games in the Jedi Knight series, is one of the Luke Skywalker's students named Jaden. One can choose race, gender, and appearance of the main character. What is more, the hero's lightsabre can be customised as well. Later on, there is also a possibility to choose either a single blade, dual blade, or a sabrestaff. Each of the weapons feature a different playstyle, animations, and moves. In addition to the elegant weapon(s) for a more civilised age, there are a few guns and explosives available.\n\nThe lightsabre combat system is truly unique and works like charm. It is easy to learn and hard to master. It punishes the weak and empowers the strong, so to speak: it rewards well-timed blows and dodges as opposed to mindless mashing the buttons as fast as possible. Moreover, it is well-balanced: every playstyle is viable. Apart from fencing, a player can use a variety of Force powers which are divided into three categories: Neutral (e.g. Push), Light (e.g. Heal), and Dark (e.g. Lightning). In single player, a player can assign points to the Light and the Dark side powers (the Neutral ones grow as the story progresses).\n\nWhile single player is decent, the clue of the game is its multiplayer. I have put around 200 hours in the multiplayer alone and I definitely am looking forward for more. Despite the game being past its prime, it still has a small but devoted community. There also are myriads of mods, characters, maps, and other types of player-created content which further improve longevity of the game.\n\nConcluding, Jedi Academy still is the top dog when it comes to Third Person Slashers and one of the best Star Wars games in my opinion. I have yet to play a game with a more enjoyable and balanced combat system. I strongly recommend trying it out even today: it may look dated, but the core mechanics are timeless. A 10/10.\n\nP.S.

It's safe to say that it has a lot of lasting power.\n\nThe game sports a very intricate lightsaber system unlike any other since then. This is what lightsaber combat should be like in all Star Wars games. The player has full control over his/her attacks unlike modern button-mashers where you are lucky to have an overly simplified combo tree.\n\nIn addition to a very well crafted lightsaber system it features a tremendous modding scene, much like any other IdTech 3 engine games. The active modders hang around at jkhub.org and are actively pushing out new models, weapons and maps. There are even some characters from The Force Awakens available.\n\nThese alone should keep you playing for days.\n\nIf you are a fan of Star Wars shooter games and think Battlefront is a little too bland and unvaried in terms of gameplay, check out the total conversion mod Movie Battles 2. It will transform the game into a funky mix of Counter-Strike and Team Fortress 2 with almost every single possible Star Wars character and location you can think of.

You will spend countless hours with them. There is a community that has stood by this game throughout the decade it has been around and I suspect they will be around for even longer. Much of the community functions in an RPG aspect where people will form their own groups and incorporate SW lore into their gatherings while other aspects of the community will focus on the skill of brandishing the lightsaber. Even further, there are countless mods offered to further enhance gameplay and your experience.\n\nSo yes! Buy and play this game. If you want to play this game however, you should do yourself the favor and play the previous games of the series so you are familiar with the lore and whatnot. It will make the experience much more rewarding once you arrive at this title.\n\nAside from the hours Steam shows here, I've must of put in another thousand hours or so that are not shown. I have many memories of the good times I had playing. This is the game of my teenage years.","April 19, 2014","true","437.1"," 52 of 54 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","52","54","0","0"

The ability to pick and choose certain missions gives you a little extra leeway in how you play the game, and what items you go into certain missions with. It even has two distinct endings, which is close to how many Mass Effect 3 had when it first came out. All joking aside, both endings do make sense in the context of the game and feel satisfying. The lightsaber combat can be a little BS sometimes, especially on higher difficulties, but whenever you have a good, long fight without randomly insta-dying, it's really satisfying and makes you feel like a Jedi.\n\n7/10.","June 22, 2014","true","54.6"," 68 of 81 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","68","81","0","0"

So, JKA.. This game is absolutely amazing. As you can tell by my recorded hours on Steam alone (add about another 1400 or so), I've played this game for a little bit. The lightsaber combat is, hands down, only matched (maybe slightly bested) by its predecessor Jedi Outcast. The gunplay, is okay, but come on, this game is called JEDI ACADEMY for a reason! The Force powers add a ridiculous angle to the gameplay in both Single and Multiplayer to keep things from getting too stale. The community for JKA is one of the most resilient communities I have encountered, they have stuck by this game for the 10+ years that this game has been around, and doesn't show too many signs of fizzling out. If you happen to be a fan of Star Wars, I would recommend buying this game, as well as Jedi Outcast, and playing the hell out of them!","September 29, 2014","true","430.0"," 47 of 49 people (96%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","96","47","49","5","2"

The lightsaber combat system is great and well-conceived, beside from your lightsaber you gonna be able to use a huge arsenal of weapons every single one of them is different and  has their own advantage and disadvantage in the battle situations. It's gets even better you can use all kind of cool force powers you have seen in star wars movies on your journey through the mission you can increase those and become even more powerful until you become a jedi knight. The game provide a high amount of different enemy types all of them are differently to defeat. One thing I like the most about Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy is the level design there is literally not one mission that feels  repetitive. I played the game from the beginning on the highest difficult which was a good choice because of that I had many intense and challenging lightsaber battles especially against siths who also get stronger from mission to mission.

It will always be a timeless classic, and although aged, its combat mechanics still hold the title of one of the most original, functional, intense, and absolutely fun engines for combat I've ever had the pleasure to experience. The lightsaber combat is at its best, tactical and precise, and at your worst, clicking furiously as Jaden slashes the saber frantically praying to avoid death, which is to say, still incredibly fun. The experience is concise and highly enjoyable, and the voice acting wonderful. The story is nothing new, but there are terrific moments, and never once does it feel unplayable, if only a bit redundant at times (which is quickly forgotten about once you get slashing and deflecting). The only major flaw with the game is a few puzzles that are unfair and require luck or prior knowledge, so keep a walkthrough open. But I assure you, to any Star Wars fan, to any Science Fiction fan, to any video game fan, there's something in here for you that's worth your time and money.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thethoon/recommended/6020/","thethoon","Thoon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thethoon/","87 products in account","An excellent multiplayer game with a forgettable singleplayer campaign\nI'll go more in-depth with the campaign below, but I'll summarize my overall impression of the game first. Buy it for the multiplayer. The campaign provides a short but fun couple of hours, though you probably won't remember it in a year. The multiplayer, however, provides a much more memorable experience. The dedicated, albeit small, playerbase is testament to that.\n\nOkay, so the singleplayer. In terms of customization, Academy succeeds. You get to pick your species/gender/lightsaber from the start. Also, aside from the main narrative driving levels, you're free to pick or ignore missions at your leisure.\n\nUnfortunately, no amount of visual flair breathes life into the main cast. Kyle Katarn and Luke Skywalker make their returns, but only sporadically. Instead, you plays as one of many new students at the Jedi Academy on Yavin 4. As interesting as that sounds, there just isn't a real spark to this game. The story plays out as another macguffin hunt and foiled attempt at resurrecting an ancient evil. The dialog is about as strong as the prequel trilogy's, in terms of tropes.\n\nI could critique the narrative structure forever, but you get the point. So ignore it, and just have fun wielding a lightsaber and throwing force powers around. The spontaneous, awesome moments of fighting squads of stormtroopers, or groups of sith-wannabe's make up for any faults.","October 27, 2014","true","16.6"," 22 of 29 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","22","29","0","0"

My only complaint is how random the lightsaber fights actually feel.  I could kill someone with a single stroke, or die over the course of three minutes.  I never found the trick to make it consistent, or seemingly skill-focused.\n\nFor a game with a LOT of weapons to pick from, you'll rarely use anything beyond your Lightsaber, due to just how effective it is at dispatching opponents, and how well it can defend you on the approach.\n\nAll in all, a great experiece and still a lot of fun all these years later.

Not a fan of Jedi Outcast, I had zero hope this title wouldn't be just as terrible. Much to my surprise, this is actually not the case and Jedi Academy fixes A LOT of the stuff I disliked about Jedi Knight II. What it doesn't fix is being a game like the original Dark Forces or, well, Jedi Knight - so, don't get your hopes up.\n\nLike Jedi Knight II, Jedi Academy has another ridiculously bad plot that holds the entire thing together, it's basic (cult planning resurrection of ancient evil), clichéd (you and your best buddy struggle with the temptation of the dark side), stupid (the final boss is straight up Saturday Morning Cartoon material and everything goes full Dungeons & Dragons towards the end). Not my cup of tea, but more entertaining than Jedi Outcast. Luckily, the developers realized that they didn't know how to tell a sensible and interesting tale - so they cut down on cutscenes and story dramatically (not so much on the fanservice and cameos, but you can't have everything).\n\nIn fact, one of the most interesting (and welcome) changes compared to Jedi Outcast is the entirely new mission structure. Instead of thinning down narrative ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that has to last several levels, they decided to give each level a short, fluffy introduction and basically make it a sidestory that ties into the main plot. Honestly, it's kinda brilliant as it allows them to not worry about consistency or anything - each mission is a unique setting with more or less unique gameplay elements. Things stay fresh and exciting until the game is nearly over - well done, Raven!\n\nAnd I gotta admit, they sure went all out on the creative front - the roughly 15 missions are snack-sized compared to Jedi Knight II and only ever last about 20-40 minutes, maybe. But that's great in my book, because who wants 2 hours of endless starship corridors or running in circles in Nar Shaddaa - I certainly don't. There are actually a lot of cool ideas implemented here, for example you are stranded on a Arrakis-like desert world including a Sandmonster that you gotta avoid to collect spaceship parts, herding slaves and prisoners away from a Rancor deep in some gangster hideout and there is even a speeder bike chase! My personal favourites include the attack run on a not-quite-space station in the atmosphere of some backwater planet - you run around the structure marking spots that Wedge Antilles is going to bomb. The cool thing about it is that you are (seemingly) more free in exploring and approaching the target areas than you ever were in the previous game. Another great idea was getting chased by Boba Fett while trying to set explosive charges all across a map - they really surprised me how much they went out of their ways to do more in Jedi Academy than just giving us more endless corridors and switch/key-puzzles. None of these maps would make for great gameplay over longer periods of time but it's all short and sweet and SO much more entertaining than basically anything happening in Jedi Outcast. To complement the almost mini-game kind of nature of some of the missions, level design has become rather straightforward - complexity is almost non-existant for the most part, but the diverse nature of the different maps and objectives help in obscuring this and make you not think about it too much. I for one enjoyed this approach, played Jedi Academy much more enthusiastically than Jedi Outcast - because (almost) each mission ment something new.\n\nMovement and combat have gotten better as well - I cannot tell wether they actually tweaked the combat engine or balanced things differently but it felt a lot more like I was in control. Zapping entire rooms of alien goons or troopers with Force Lightning and sending them flying from bridges and walkways was AMAZING, anything standing afterwards was cut down with some fierce lightsaber moves. The "realisticcombat" and "dismemberment" modifications are an absolute must for maximum badassery, though. There is a lot less ♥♥♥♥♥♥ platforming too and enough room for mistakes this time around - so even if things are still a bit floaty and imprecise, it didn't matter too much and sold me on the whole Jedi combat thing. Especially later, when you encounter plenty of adepts and have different combat styles as well as refined force powers to choose from, the way I send their heads flying left and right made me feel Ninja Gaiden-levels of badass.  And then you suddenly team up with your fellow students from the Academy and the screen explodes with colorful glowsticks dealing death all around you. Good ♥♥♥♥ and a lot more exciting (again) than Jedi Outcast.\n\nOverall a massive improvement compared to Raven's first effort and quite a high note to end the Jedi Knight saga on. Still holds up today, I think, and worth checking out if you feel like kicking some Dark Jedi ♥♥♥.","November 15, 2015","true","7.7"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","15","18","0","0"

My personal favorite is probably cutting down cultists with a lightsaber during a speeder chase.\n\nThe saber duels are some of the most stylish you'll ever see in a game, but sadly the enjoyability of them is extremely hampered by how luck-based they can get when you fight an enemy on even footing with you. I had to resort to save-spamming before and after every single encounter (and there are many, many such fights), and going so far as to abuse range limits and pitfalls to win half of them.\n\nOther than that, the only real downside to the game is that so much hack-and-slash, especially with the exhaustingly difficult Sith fights, can wear on the patience. And try not to let your customized character fool you: this isn't really an RPG. You choose your force powers and your saber style, but you only make one story choice in the entire game - right before the climax.\n\nAll told I recommend trying it out.

IT'S HOW YOU USE THEM\n\n-Jedi Academy is the follow up to Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast. It uses the same assets and--with the exception of two new lightsaber styles--has mostly the same gameplay. The graphics haven't aged well and weren't that great to begin with. The script is poorly written and the acting is terrible. Level design is hit or miss, with many platforming sections that just don't work and one vehicular segment that is god-awful. There's a lot wrong with this game.\n-But stay with me here.\n-Jedi Academy, despite it's numerous flaws, is one of the most entertaining Star Wars games in existence. It, along with Jedi Outcast, nail lightsaber combat with a very responsive system where every directional movement cooresponds with a unique saber slash. The force abilities aren't balanced that well, but they work well in the flow of combat.\n-You will enjoy destroying many stormtroopers, as they are the general cannon fodder of the game. After that, you will enjoy fighting dark jedi who become increasingly more frequent as the game goes on. Play your cards right in the end and you will be fighting four or five at a time in frantic combat.\n-Along with the saber you can use a variety of weapons, but really they're only useful for certain segments. 99% of the game will be spent chopping people up, and that's okay.\n-The story isn't all that compelling, though it has a few parts with great ideas. Kyle Katarn is at your side for a large portion of the game, though often you'll feel annoyed that you aren't playing as him. While you get to create your character's appearance and saber style, you have no control over who they are. Jaden, the main character, is essentially a blank slate who has been victim of incredibly lazy writing. It's hard to tell who to blame for the shoddy voice acting, but it seems like the direction of the script really didn't give anyone room to work with. All the story cutscenes use in-game engine graphics and animations, so it leads to very wooden conversations and some hilariously bad acrobatics.\n-If you can get over the half-♥♥♥♥♥ story you'll get to experience some great combat and a unique handful of levels that go across several different planets. Even if you don't like Star Wars, this is something you could probably get into. Anyone with an appreciation for melee combat done right will find something to like here. Even if you don't care for the story, there's always online multiplayer (which I hear is still active) to participate in.\n\nFINAL VERDICT\n-Lots of flaws with this one, but it's a rough gem. Not many Star Wars game are this enjoyable. If you're looking for a good fix for Jedi action, skip buying the new Battlefront and give this one a try. It's a better game--cheaper too. While I'd ultimately say Jedi Outcast is the better one, Jedi Academy undisputably is more accessible and consistently entertaining.

The game features both lightsaber combat and the use of blasters, and perplexingly enough some kind of illegal bugzapper weapon that disintergrates people. Odd choice for a Jedi, and nobody seems to give a ♥♥♥♥ if you use it. Well, guns are in general pretty awful in this game, and you should stick with the lightsaber. It has a nice feeling to it, it's responsive and the lightsaber battles, as much as it seems to just be flinging the saber around until someone dies, feels cinematic and when you cut someone with it, it's satisfying. Especially against multiple bladed combatants. Unfortunately g_saberrealisticcombat and whatever other command it was to make it so that you could dismember with the lightsaber seems gimped at best, completely removed at worst.\n\nIt's a shame since that was one of the best parts about Jedi Outcast.\nThe story is somewhat unfocused and kind of ♥♥♥♥, you mainly just jump from planet to planet and kill stormtroopers, bountyhunter or the occasional wildlife, much to the dismay of the intergalactic PETA. (I'm joking, I sure as hell hope there's no such thing as People for the ethical treatment of Rancors)\nA bit later into the game you get to choose whether to have a double bladed, dual, or a single lightsaber. "Why the hell  would I pick a single lightsaber? That seems lame"\nWell I agree, dual lighstabers are badass, but on another level i feel that it's a lot more practical with the single one, especially since you can switch between three styles.\nAside from lasers and lightsabers, you get to choose to use force powers, and can throughout the game upgrade them at your leisure. You can choose from the dark side powers as well as lightside, and you can balance them both without getting a penalty for it. Some of the powers are useless and some are broken, such as level three force lightning. It can kill a whole room of stormtroopers pretty much instantly, but it's useless before level 3.\nAside from fighting there are some minor tedious puzzles such as getting prisoners around a rancor, however you can kill it to make the process less annoying.\n\nAll in all it's a rather solid game with good lightsaber combat, but I'd suggest picking up Jedi Outcast 2 as well.","July 26, 2014","true","24.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecolorurple/recommended/6020/","thecolorurple","TheColorUrple","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thecolorurple/","511 products in account","I always found it curious why Jedi Outcast and its sequel, Academy, dropped the Dark Forces moniker. I had figured it was for brevity and clarity, since Jedi Knight III: Jedi Academy - Dark Forces IV, the name I would have chosen since it's a badass mind♥♥♥♥, alas isn't marketable.\n\nBut I get it now. It's because the original Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II was very much a Dark Forces game, moreso than a Jedi Knight game. This is due to its pretty awful lightsaber implementation versus its pretty awesome gunplay. The original Dark Forces, just to be clear, had no lightsabers. It didn't need them. For the sequel, everybody wanted to use a lightsaber, so LucasArts tried to deliver. Unfortunately, Kyle Katarn couldn't block any incoming shots effectively, and I guess you could say it's because he was still in training and he sucked at being a Jedi. He was better at being a gunslinging mercenary, and thus the original Jedi Knight game made for a better shooter than a lightsaber sim. Hence, Dark Forces II.\n\nThe Raven Software sequels are both lightsaber-centered, and ironically, they're both ♥♥♥♥♥♥ shooters. Gone are the Dark Forces days where the gun fights had weight and speed. Now, instead of strafing around like madmen, stormtroopers are content to pretty much just stand there as you shoot at them, and fire back at such a constant rate that you could tap your foot to the blaster's beat. As you sink your shots back into their armor, they stand still, unflinching, as if they didn't realize they had lasers burning through them. It's all very smoothly animated, like butter, but it's also really boring.\n\nThe guns are also wildly ineffective, since as an alternative, you can run through these guys with your lightsaber flashing, cutting each one down with one stroke WHILE managing to block every incoming shot automatically by just having your lightsaber equipped. This game is exceptional at teaching you just how pointless the guns are, which makes it surprising that you still have to choose your weapons at the beginning of each mission.\n\nOnce the Dark Jedi start appearing, the game gets good, after a very dull first few missions. I was initially amazed at their ability to cut me down so quickly, and I got frustrated, thinking that the combat was just about swinging the lightsaber wildly and getting lucky. While the sabers don't connect in clear offensive/defensive poses very often, there still is a strategy. For one thing, a few defensive force powers are critical to surviving the tougher Dark Jedi, and once you figure out to map them to keyboard keys, the fighting gets a lot easier. (Of course, the game doesn't teach you this.) For another, circle strafing becomes the best tactic, since most of your attacks get blocked when you swing head-on. The resultant visuals look like a sort of randomized dance, lacking choreography but still well executed. And when you get the kill, the camera goes into a slow-motion 360 twirl around your custom-made character as he/she lands the finishing blows, and that never gets old.\n\nYou can loosely compare the Dark Forces games' visual style to the original Star Wars trilogy - grungy, old, rough around the edges, beautiful. Likewise, you can compare the Jedi Knight II sequels to the Prequel Trilogy - flashy, pretty, colorful, smooth.\n\nSince the story, environments, music (the John Williams themes are cut up, out of place, and butchered here), dialogue, etc. are all pretty bad (or at the very least outdated), the game relies on its blend of lightsaber combat and force powers to keep you interested. Those two elements are good enough to merit a playthrough, which is why I recommend the game.\n\n\n7/10\n\nGraphics note: The max resolution available is pretty awful, but can be modified with a config edit (check the forums) to use your HD monitor's native setting. I got it running at 1440p, which looks remarkably good, but the game loaded with a blank white screen every 20th time or so, forcing a game restart. Annoying but not game-breaking, and worth it for the picture quality :P","January 23, 2014","true","9.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Jedi Academy is a classic. The game features the best lightsaber combat system in all Star Wars games. There are hundreds of mods, even for the singeplayer experience. Both multiplayer and singeplayer are great. However, there are no brazilian servers, so its kinda hard to play with 180 MS for the poeple who live in Brazil like me. I think you should definetly buy this game, especially if you are a Star Wars fan. Many references to the movies, comics and expanded universe here. Dont think twice, especially if it's on sale.

Do I think the game is good, however? Well, it does say "Recommended", right? However, as I usually do, I will keep the bad stuff of the game ahead.\n\nFirst and foremost, while the game doesn't have as many as the previous game, it still has a few graphical errors with modern games. Mainly resolutions being 4:3, but those are fixed quite easily.\n\nWhat is probably the biggest problem, however, ain't the graphics but the direction the game takes. Remember the enthralling storyline the previous game had? Not here. In here instead, Kyle becomes a secondary character, and instead you create your own character, which sounds great on paper... But falls flat, as you're only given the choice of your combat style, being male or female, your outfit and race, and later on the game, what ending you want. You can also choose what missions to do, but that's kinda pointless as you have to clear at least 4 of the 5 given missions to advance the game.\n\nAnd that's another thing, the missions themselves are... Well, dissapointing compared to the previous game. Jedi Academy goes more for an "arcade" style, with items arround it and quantity of enemies over quality. Not until later in the game you're given a proper challenge, and even then half the enemies will be easy to kill by pushing them down a cliff and similar stuff. It also doesn't help at all that the game is WAY more short than the previous.\n\nIt's third problem, is a character itself. Rosh. At the first minute of your playthrough you meet this guy, and even since then you will most likely hate him already. He's a piece of ♥♥♥♥, a worthless meatbag, and a bad character overall. And the hilarious part is that the writers of the game probably knew it, and  give you the option to kill him near the end, unlocking the Sith ending.\n\nThe last issue this game has, is that weapons are irrelevant. From the start of the game you'll have your light-saber, and you'll BARELY use anything else, which is a shame, as the game still has it's great FPS action there from the previous game. It does force you to use them in one of the missions, and there is a new cool weapon, but that's it.\n\nAll that aside, however, what do we have left? An enjoyable game were you get to feel like a motherf#cking Badass Jedi. Likely because of the incompetent enemies, but a Badass never the less.\n\nLight-saber combat is not only great, but it beats the previous game. Not only there are a few new moves, but there are also 2 new styles of combat: using two light-sabers at the same time, or using a dual-blade saber. There are also some sort of special attacks that can be used when hitting Mouse 1 and Mouse 2 at the same time, which consumes half your Force bar, but deal insane damage.\n\nAbout force powers, they're still there. Some have changed whoever, some have been erased, and some others have been added. The game does f#ck it when it gives you the choice of getting them at the order you desire, as they can make the game EXTREMELY EASY early on (such as the Lightning force power at LVL3, which nearly instantly kills most enemies of the early game, and deals high damage to enemy jedis, even pushing them back). Later in the game you'll have to get used to them to advance, and they can also be used to find cool secret areas, although there are not nearly as many as in the previous game.\n\nThe multiplayer is also back in action, having more content and active players than the previous game, mainly because it has nearly all the crap it had before, but with some new aditions. Tons of models to choose for yourself (also having the option of making a custom one for yourself, like in the singleplayer game), and tons of maps and gamemodes as well.\n\nThe game is also easily modabble, for the people out there who want to add crazy ♥♥♥♥ to the game, but that's up to you. It does help, however, to add better animations, textures and such.\n\nIs the game good? Yes. You'll have fun. However, if you're looking for a singleplayer experience, go play Jedi Knight; Jedi Outcast 2, as it delivers WAAAAAAAAAAY better than Jedi Academy. If you're looking for multiplayer action or mods, then this one's for you, and it's a solid purchase on a sale.\n\nAnd for the love of f#ck, kill Rosh.","January 13","true","8.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","7","8","2","5"

I bought this game as a part of a collection called the Star Wars Jedi Knight collection, and my God, was this a wise decision.\n\nYears and years ago, back in 2003, this came was released and my Dad quickly bought the game...and one year later, I got my hands on a pirated version of the game (back when my Dad was a huge pirate) and I played the hell out of it.  Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy is one of my most played games, and one of the only games that I was willing to finish over and over and over again as a child.  I didn't grow up with an SNES, NES, Atari, Comodore 64, or PS2...I grew up with this damn game.  And as soon as I saw this on sale I had to buy this, because this game was my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed childhood.\n\nThis is one of my favorite games of all-time for its amazing combat, horrible voice acting and great level design.  As I was playing through this game, as was absolutely astounded by how little it has aged...yeah, the graphics are quite dated, but the gameplay sure as hell isn't.\n\nSwinging your lightsabre around feels so damn good, along with slicing people's arms off and running around with a blaster rifle, and is in my opinion, one of the few Star Wars games that have actually accomplished the feel of wielding a lightsabre, without a damn Kinect to immerse you in the lightsabre.\n\nAnd as I mentioned before, the level design is top-notch, fitting the overall feel of each world that you go through and sets the overall tone for the world that you have selected.  The Rancor world makes you ♥♥♥♥ing scared, while the acid rain level gets this feeling of doom and dispair.  The gameplay is something that I have really missed with modern FPSs, andit's a damn shame we can't get another Star Wars game like this now that Lucas Arts is now a publishing company now that Disney owns Lucasfilm.\n\nStar Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy is a wonderful nostalgia trip for me, with great level design, satisfying lightsabre combat, great art design and a great final boss...that's why I recommend this game.","July 12, 2014","true","22.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It gets everything from the previous games right, and continues to add atmosphere and story to this ever growing universe.\n\nGood points -\n1. Fighting, the fighting is just down right fun, you can just bounce all around your enemies and dodge everyone of their moves and feel like a complete bad ♥♥♥ while doing so.\n2. Exploration, outside of just getting through the objectives, there are puzzles that while some might not find hard, I did get stuck on for a few minutes and they made me look around at the map and see how expansive they make these worlds, while you may not even explore them all. The secret areas from the previous games return, but unless you really need an extra health pack, and or ammo refill, you don't have much motivation for finding these areas.\n\nBad points -\n1. Story, if you didn't already know, this game has you playing as a student at the Jedi Academy, while you and your friends, fight this sith cult. There really isnt much to say, you fight the baddies. There is nothing new about this story, we have all seen it in other forms before.\n\nOverall - I really enjoyed this game, it is action packed and filled with some variety in what you do, but as I said before the story is a bit lacking, other than that, this is a game that has hours of fun packed in it. I know I didn't talk about the Multiplayer, because to speak the truth, I couldn't find anyone who had the game, and since the only other option are bots, I played like one game, and there wasn't much to say about it, you were fighting enemies like in the game, and it was fun and all, but I didn't think I needed to say much about it.","August 10, 2015","true","24.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

But as it failed in some areas, it excelled in others. The worst thing about the game are first two mission sets. Playing it in 2015 I was wondering why I completed so many playthroughs, if it doesn't have the soul of Jedi Outcast and feels as old, aged slasher. I was reminded of this the second I had to fight a guy wielding two lightsabers. And then came the lightstaffs. And I loved this game again.\nGraphisc is old, and there's no helping that, but light effects are still quite nice.\nThe storry is poor and cut in replacable pieces, but has two endings. Maybe the problem is that choosing the Dark Side made me feel like a total ♥♥♥♥, and made some combat unberably tough (jedi masters with staffs are overhyped).

You can hop onto a server and either sit there and chat with people, you can run around swinging your lightsaber like a madman, or you can have duels with people and polish up on your skills. I reccomend this game to anyone who is a fan of star wars or to anyone that enjoyed GUNZ: the duel, it's only $9.99 you can spare that for a game that you will most likely fall in love with like I did.","October 20, 2015","true","238.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","3"

This might only show that I have a short time recorded on it but if you were to check my xfire profile 'truean1hal4ti0n' you will see that I have over 850 hours on this fine game. Why is it great you might ask?\n\nIn a certain sense, freedom of choice. Don't let that statement mislead you, it isn't an open world game. However, you will experience the most personally controlled combat system you can ever find in this game. You attack differently based on which way you are moving, what stance you're holding, and then there are combos and force attacks, and mixed saber/force attacks. It's hard really to explain exactly what I'm talking about, except that you will find this to have a very entertaining combat system, with a huge learning curve.\n\nWhat else is great about it? The community. Not all of it, but a select few clans namely the Angels of Fire Jedi Order. There are some others, like this fine clan, which reach out to the community to establish a fun and friendly yet serious gaming environment where you will always feel like family, and will never be made to feel like less than another.\n\nThe single player has a decent story, but not quite as good in comparison to other Jedi Knight titles. This game really shines in the multiplayer, where you can meet some great people and learn how to play a great game.\n\nIf you do decide to pick up this game, head on over to the AoF clan server labeled AoF recruiting and be introduced properly into the game!","January 4, 2014","true","136.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","2"

Its got good combat, Fun gameplay, and an Interesting story. One thing I always remember was the customization for your Jedi. Its not like Saints Row or Skate 3, but for the time it was cool to not only pick your character but actually customizing your race, clothes, skin color, and even your own lightsaber. Yes, you heard me correctly, you get to customize your own lightsaber! You can give it different hilts and saber color except for red which made me sad for a second but I guess you are a Jedi so it wouldn't make much sense and you can have a red saber in multiplayer, around half-way through the story you lose your lightsaber and get a choice between dual wielded lightsabers, and the famous double-sided lightsaber from Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace. The combat is pretty much the same from Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast which means good for those who have never played a Jedi Knight game. You get a variety of different weapons in the game like the Wookie Bowcaster to the famous E-11 stormtrooper blaster, but the problem is that you get your lightsaber from the very beginning of the game so theres almost no reason to use the guns in the game except for a few missions where you lose your lightsaber and all the rest of your weapons but you can still use the force.\n\nThe enemies are pretty varied, you fight Stormtroopers, Mercenaries, Sith, and Creatures such as the Rancor. Sometimes they get stronger weapons which can be a bit of a challange. Finally I'm going to talk about the story, Like I mentioned, you play as a new jedi named Jaden Korr who goes to learn at Luke Skywalker's Academy, but the temple was attacked by a cult known as the Deciples of Ragnos, Who are trying to resurrect a Sith Lord who died 5000 years ago. So its up to Jaden Korr and his master Kyle Katarn to stop Ragnos from rising from the dead and to bring peace to the galaxy. Its not as good as Jedi Knight II but its a neat addition. Overall this is a good game from the Star Wars franchise, The game can be fun but its got its flaws, I give it eight Lightsabers out of ten. If you like Star Wars and/or slicing Stormtrooper arms or just want to play a fun game then this game is for you","February 1, 2014","true","22.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I played this gem. Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy is probably, by far, my most favorite Star Wars game.\n\nPS: Despite my gametime is only 3 odd hours or so, I've actually beaten this game multiple times in the past.. with my now abandoned Windows XP machine. Ha.\n\nThis game offers two modes, single player where you progress through the storyline as Jaden or Multiplayer where you play against other players in Royal Rumble FFA or Capture the Flag (my favorite mode). This review emphasizes on SP side.\n\nIn single player, you'll have to beat three chapters consisting five episodes each to the total of fifteen. And later you have to beat 'boss levels' after each chapter, so make it eighteen. Gametime as a whole for SP mode isn't that long, ten odd hours or less. But still, entertaining. Each episode has its own unique objective, ranging from rescue mission to dismantling bombs. The variety of environment design and levels also make it enjoyable to progress through this single player missions.\n\nEverytime you enter an episode, except boss levels, you'll have a chance to assign one Force Power to pick one among eight options, four Light Core and four Dark Cores. This makes things a bit more personal and customizable to suit your liking. You want to be the real Protector Jedi? Pick Light Cores. Or you want to be the real dark side? Get Rage and Lightning Force for all chaos you want! Do note that picking Cores doesn't affect the ending, despite Luke's review after each Act finished. The ending (good side or dark side) will be affected much later in the game by making a choice. I won't spoil that, though, here.\n\nCustomization extends a bit more, where you can select from pre-made character designs and your lightsaber hilts / color. Much later in the game, you'll be allowed to construct more advanced lightsaber like Duals and Staff. And yeah, unlike in previous title Outcast, you'll have this lightsaber right off the bat in your arsenal. Only the Advanced Lightsabers that won't be available straight from the start.\n\nControl mappings admittedly are very nice. You'll have no issue assigning keyboard buttons to specific action e.g Jumping or Crouching. The  menu also can detect modern Keyboards/Mice weird buttons so you can assign the commands to those as well.\n\nGame mechanic is terrific and personally for me it's this game's strongest point. With Lightsaber available in many styles, you can have fun fighting your opponents - slashing right and left and launching Lightning attacks at them. All done in real time! There are few combos you can learn from in-game manuals so that you can have easier fights especially when playing on higher difficulty levels. I rarely trigger my guns, except when forced in one level - in that level your Lightsaber is confiscated so yeah....\n\nGraphic wise, the game's not aged well. In order to 'play' the game properly, you have to get some settings right. First, the tame has to be manually set up if you want to play on widescreens - pretty much modern LCDs. Lower textures are seen from the get-go everywhere - by today's standard, anyway.  There's a workaround for that, though. Mods for textures are also available to make it more bearable if you can't stand the original. Game also refuses to be minimized, making it silly if you love to alt-tab while playing like me.\n\nAs it stands, there are game breaking bugs. I've personally encountered bugs where a door essential to progress refused to open (dismantling the bombs mission in a reactor). I restarted that mission from the scratch and hoped to progress, luckily I was able to after restart. Don't expect a patch for this.\n\nHowever, being an old game, you can expect your weak rig that can't run Evolve or some other high demanding games NOW launches this game with ease, with all graphic settings maxed. Game also is compatible with modern OS, much to my surprise. I am running this game well on Windows 7 x64 and 8.1 x64 without issues - other than issues from the game itself (game breaking bug I wrote above). I can't say about MAC version as I don't have MAC, or Linux if you want to WINE this.\n\nAll in all, a very recommended game even for just Single Player if you can't stand Multiplayer.\n\nOld school score: 9.5/10","February 15, 2015","true","5.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The game is much more lightsaber oriented as is shown by giving you one right at the beginning. And that is what the game excels at - lightsaber combat. Oh, and how much fun it is! With the dismemberment option on it feels like really having a powerful weapon you can cut every opponent with. On top of that you of course get Force powers. The story is not bad but lacks focus because you play as an unknown character without any background. Instead of looking over some plot events it instead rotates around your decisions to either become a Jedi or a Sith. This also effects the level design a bit. However it remains fun and enjoyable. Noteworthy are also two other things - multiplayer and mods. The community of players who play online is still strong and even some mods have a big following of players. The mods especially use most of the potential. like when some mods are letting you play ALL Star Wars lightsaber duels (movie ones and also others). This is definitely a game for anyone who likes Star Wars and lightsaber combat. Recommended!","May 24, 2015","true","0.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/6020/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","975 products in account","Jedi Academy is the latest and greatest (2003) of the Kyle Katarn/Dark Forces Star Wars series and the only one that I was able to play recently, due to the older games’ incompatibility with more modern Windows versions. I was unfortunately unable to get the game to run at higher resolutions than the default 800 x 600, but since I’ve played the game before, I was able to go through pretty fast and just ignore the poor graphics. The game is more than a decade old after all.\n\nThe game’s story follows a new Jedi recruit named Jaden as he tries to work his way up to Jedi knight status. He has to hit the ground running though, since his very first day arriving at the academy there’s an attack by a mysterious Sith cult called the Disciples of Ragnos. This cult of dark force users is led by Tavion, one of the minor villains from a previous Jedi Knight game, who has now acquired some ancient Sith tech and is able to power up herself and her followers with it. With some help from your master Kyle Katarn, you have to stop Tavion and her followers from their grand plan of resurrecting a long dead Sith lord.\n\nLike the preceding Dark Forces Jedi Knight games, Jedi Academy is a first person shooter except when you pop out your lightsabre, then it switches to a third person perspective. Honestly though, you should probably have your lightsabre out all the time, so really it’s a third person sword game where you can use guns if you want. Right from the start you have a few force powers to choose from, such as push, pull, speed, and sight. These powers improve naturally as you go through the game and you can also choose between light/dark powers such as heal, lightning, protect, etc. I’ve played through the game about half a dozen times and I almost always get the same powers (heal, lightning, dark rage). They’re just too good to skip. You won’t be able to max all of the available skills, but you do have some room to experiment.\n\nThe guns in the game, while good, just can’t match the effectiveness of a lightsabre. The lightsabre not only kills most enemies in one hit, it also deflects enemy lasers. As you progress, your ability to deflect/reflect enemy shots improves, and by the end you probably won’t be taking much damage from stormtroopers. The true obstacles in your path will be the cultist warriors who use lightsabres and force powers of their own. Lightsabre combat is a huge part of the game and if you suck at it, you’ll be stomped many times over. Fortunately (or not) there seems to be a tremendous element of luck when it comes to sword fighting, and if you swing wildly, there’s a good chance you’ll chop down the weaker enemies easily. Just remember that the game doesn’t autosave very often, so if you don’t manually save before sword fights, you might end up replaying large sections of the game. Remember how I said there was a lot of luck involved? Yeah, a weak enemy can slice you down in one shot very easily.\n\nPros:\n+Right from the start you have force powers and a lightsabre, unlike the previous Dark Forces games I played. The sword fighting can make you feel like a badass with the slow-mo kills and katas (flashy sword moves) that you can use.\n+The story is intriguing and you get to try out a bunch of Star Wars weaponry. Most of them suck, but the concussion rifle is pretty cool. Watch out for the splash damage though, it’s huge. Remember though, that guns do not work on enemy force users. They either reflect the shot at you or just dodge it like Neo.\n\nCons:\n-The game is very old, and with that comes poor graphics and incompatibility with Windows 7 & 8. You can get the game to run, but the screen resolution thing is very annoying. I tried everything from using compatibility mode to manually setting custom resolutions and restarting, but it just never changed.\n-It is possible to just run through most of the game not fighting anyone, especially in the last few levels. The vast majority of enemies will stop chasing you if you get more than one room away. This includes the more powerful cultist sword masters as well (the real threats). Also, if you’re looking for an overpowered force ability, the force lightning can get you through most of the game, clearing out entire rooms of baddies in one shot.\n\nOverall, the game is fun to play, and if you have it from the recent Star Wars bundle, this is probably the oldest game on there that I would still replay. The other Dark Forces/Jedi Knight games have aged poorly and may not be worth it, despite how good they were back in the day.\n","March 26, 2015","true","6.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/victorasia/recommended/6020/","victorasia","Victorasia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/victorasia/","128 products in account","This game is the best RPG in the future EU of Star Wars. The Characters, Character Customization, and Story are bad. The Gameplay and Power Customization are good. The Character Customization is very small, and there is "five" combat styles and four powers for each side (dark and light), plus neutral powers. The gameplay is solid, and there is enough customization for each side, but the story is mediocre, and it somehow has more customization in multiplayer (which is very fun) and there is no replay value. The levels are very linear, except for keyhunts, and the enemies are squishy and easy to blow, except for force and lightsaber users.\nYou can get more styles, like medium, fast and strong. Later you ***** your **** with ***** and then your ***** becomes evil, you can get two lightsaber and or a double sided one, Darth Maul Style, and colors, except red. In multiplayer you can choose red lightsaber and changing characters (or use standart models) and you can choose you force powers in a way superior than the campaign. You start with a finite points, and used them in different powers.\nThe campaign has five side missions, you do at least four and you unlock the main mission. Each mission allows you to choose one point to the your increasily force arsenal, and choose weapons to use. The story is bland, but the gameplay is very fun, and powering up  your arsenal is fun. There is one mission that your fellow classmates attack with you, and I hoped that there were more missions like that.\nI didn't play any other dark forces games, but I wished there were more downloadable missions, multiplayer maps, and customization. I liked it and recomend it and I played the campaign in 20 hours, and playing six on multiplayer. I thought it could be remade with modern technology, and more features, and maybe co-op.\nSummary: Good Gameplay, Bad Story. Good Game, needs more Content, 20~hours and I like it, so you should too.","January 14, 2015","true","34.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","4","5","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/droidsrule/recommended/6020/","droidsrule","Cthulhu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/droidsrule/","63 products in account","I thoroughly enjoyed this game. The lightsaber combat is amazing, i'd even venture to say the best ever seen. First of all you can decide between 3 different lightsabers: Single saber, Dual sabers, and Double bladed saber. I recommend you try all of them and look at guides to see which one fits your playstyle. Second of all, The reason the lightsaber combat is so good is because its very accurate to how a Jedi would fight. You see, Jedi look slightly into the future when they fight , thats why they are so good at fighting. And how could you incorporate this into a players hand (who is probably not precognitive)? Auto-Block. The perfect solution. You block most things, but enemys can get through it by battering your defenses enough, or cleverly useing the environment and Force powers to get around it. This brings me to another point, the Force. Any Jedi or Sith should have this at his disposal, or else you are nothing more than a Sith brawler. A good amount of Force powers, 4 unique to the Light side, 4 unique to the Dark side, and 4 available to both. I wont go indepth with the force powers, mainly because there are guides explaining that, and of course you can train offline with them to see what fits you. Enough of that, hows the story? Well i wont spoil anything, but the story is about the New Republic. And you are Jaden Korr, a talented young force sensitive person who built his lightsaber BEFORE his training. The story gives you a Light & Dark choice throughout, for 2 different endings depending on what you decided. So yes, the story was enjoyable, although since this is the beginning of mouth-movement in cinematics and it looks very clunky, but thats part of its charm. Now, what about blasters? Yes blasters are in this, and they can be very good if used correctly. Although deflecting a blaster shot back at enemy and watching them get thrown backwards is oh so satifying, you have to be careful of those blasters, especially the sniper one. it'll get you from across the map. Blasters are deadly if used right is my point. And they add a bit of spice to gameplay! My final verict: A MUST OWN for any Star Wars fan or Dueling fan, as long as you're not the kind of person that cant stand lower than normal graphics this is your game, 8/10","October 18, 2014","true","74.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

In the single-player story there are some puzzles, boss fights, and plenty of enemies to slice up in a variety of ways. You'll also get to visit some iconic locations and meet some of iconic characters. There are some really exhilirating moments throughout the story! The story is good, yet a bit basic. Also, there was a plot twist that I didn't get because I didn't play any of the previous games but that is minor.

Well look no further cause this is the game for you. Star wars Jedi knight: Jedi academy is the fourth game in the jedi knight series. The campaign sets you up as a student of the new jedi academy run by Master Luke Skywalker. You basically complete missions while also trying to figure out the motives of a mysterious sith cult. There are over 20 missions available.\n\nGameplay involves intense combat, some platforming and puzzle solving. You start of with a light sabre and limited force powers. As you play, you will unlock new sabres, weapons and force powers. The lightsabre combat looks amazing, especially when you face the sith guys (really flashy). Other weapons include: Rifles, sniper, rockets, shotgun, grenades and pistol. Each weapon has a secondary fire mode such as scope, grnade launcher, charged shot, auomatic fire etc. You have limited ammunition available for guns and will need to restock via containers or looted from corpses. With each mission you complete you can select a new force power to level up/learn. You can only choose light and dark force powers to learn and upgrade, with the neutral powers upgrading naturally as you progress though the story. Besides the sith, you also face other foes such as stormies, jet troopers, thugs, rancor and wampas.\n\nThe level design is amazing. Each mission you do, sets you in a unique place with different objectives available. The level of detail of the levels are great as there are plenty space to move around and secrets to find.\n\nThe sound is also good. Besides the awesome star wars soundtrack that we are accustomed to from the movies, the voice acting in this game is good as well.\n\nBesides the single player campaign, there is also a multiplayer mode available. In multiplayer you and 15 other players face off in arenas. Everyone has lightsabres and a few guns. There are also bots available (up to 15) that you can play with should the multiplayer be dead (which unfortunately it is). You can choose a large variety of characters to play as/face off including stormies, boba fett, Luke etc. Furthermore, you can customise you lightsabre colour, hilt, fighting style (dual, single, attached sabres) as well as force powers. There are a variety of game modes including: deathmatch, team deathmatch and capture the flag. In the arenas, you can find power ups, health packs as well as new guns to play with.\n\nI highly recommend this game for fans or star wars or people who want good hack and slash game. Worth every cent.","February 8, 2015","true","9.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/korerat/recommended/6020/","korerat","KoreRat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/korerat/","636 products in account","Jedi academy uses the same engine and builds off the story of its predecessor.  However this time around you aren’t playing as Kyle Katarn but as Jaden Korr.  A both gender and species neutral name that allows for character customization.  Something that they took as a integral part of the creating of this game.  You can choose your species, gender, outfit, lightsaber hilt, and blade color.  And given the time period, this was a very new thing for a game like this.\n\nThe story starts off great, and fully to what I would expect.  It was nice to be able to choose the missions performed and the order of them.  As well as being able to skip the last one and move the story on to the next plot point.  Of course doing so would effect your characters powers, since you are taking away the chance to level up a Force power.  Its a definite give and take, and I opted to take the short route more often then otherwise.\n\nWhile the story does start off strong, it quickly weakens, and all but falls to the floor.  The idea that a cult of dark Force users are draining the force energies from different locations across the galaxy.  It has so many holes its just ridiculous, and I haven’t even gotten into the details of it.  But the worst part of the story, is the blatant teenager fantasy.  Its a story that was written for angsty teenagers looking for something to connect to.  It also screams predictability from the first scripted sequence to the last.  You don’t need to be a, well anything, to figure out what’s going to happen next.\n\nThere are some locations that felt like they were thrown into the game as a ‘Hey look, where you get to go!”.  And after I played and did a little research I discovered  that’s exactly why they added the location!  Tatooine, Hoth, and even a Rancor and Chewbacca are all there just so they can say they are there.  Taking a thing, and writing a story around it is never a good idea.  And here they have done it four times inside the main story arc.  They only thing that helps this is the way the missions are offered as single objectives that aren’t integral to the plot.\n\nGetting away from the story and focusing on some of the better aspects of the game, like the gameplay.  The lightsaber combat was acceptable at most.  Maybe its just me, but it was also laughable.  There is a move set you can work with, or you can be like me and and just click M1 like a manic and hope for the best.  Button combos have never been my strong point, with only succeeding at them with a handful of games.  And Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy was not one of them.  Sometimes in my rapid clicking I would preform some random move, surprising even myself, before going back to my standard slashing.\n\nI have a problem with games that use lightsabers, because they always weaken them.  A lightsaber doesn’t cut through anything like a hot knife through butter.  But it will do this with most things.  I can forgive a games engine not allowing me to cut the railings off of a scaffolding.  But one swing on a Stormtrooper should be all that’s needed to remove that Trooper as obstacle, one swing.  Unless it is wielding a lightsaber to block the attack or is armored with Cortosis, one hit.\n\nHe called it a “laser sword”…  Seriously at one point there was a short scripted sequence where a thug or Stormtrooper or somebody used the phrase ‘laser sword’.  I about turned the game off there.\n\nThe AI has its moments of udder fail.  Things like Stormies just standing there and shooting you as you walk right up to them and cut them down.  There are also mission where you are followed by a companion, and often times they show you just how much they love to fall into pits.  I swear Kyle spent more time at the bottom of a shaft than actually helping me.  All the while making comments about how hes ‘got this one’.  It just became a joke, and I had all but forgotten he was a part of the level.\n\nThe game ends almost as predictably as it progressed, and just as predicted I didn’t really care.  I was just happy to be done with another game, and ready to move onto something else.  Not as well rounded a game as Jedi Outcast was, but better then the rest of the series.","May 16, 2013","true","10.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Should have been titled "Star Wars Jedi Knight 3: Jedi Academy." The Jedi Knight games have a continuing story line with Jedi Knight 2: Outcast preceeding this one. Approximately, twenty hours of game play. Very well thought out story line and missions. Considering the date it was released, very good production. I would have given it a 9/10 if it wasn't for memory allocation bugs resulting in crashes that existed at its release to today. Also, experienced bug'd trigger events, two, requiring exiting and starting the game to correct. Overall the game was well worth the sale price of $5 (versus $10) and an enjoyable twenty hours.

Better than the hack jobs of Force Unleashed and Force Unleased 2 by a wide margin.\n\nThe lightsaber combat in this is actually tactical and requires a fair amount of skill to get good at. Later levels in the game even sport some skilled AI that can result in epic battles or instant kills if you're unlucky, un-skilled, or just not careful.\n\nEnvironments/Levels in this game are varied and dangerous for both you and your opponents as virtually anything in the game environment can be used to kill/maim/injure.\n\nPowers available to you through the Light and Dark side aren't restrictive and you can mix and match all you want until you hit the power cap (choose wisely!). The power creep in this game isn't overwhelmingly in your favor either, with a nice steady progression through the game as you unlock points to invest into powers of your choosing.\n\nControls require some personal configuration and the management of them does get annoying. Combat controls are easy to grasp and the seamless transition from saber to blaster is nice.\n\nThe game is even fully voice acted and has a solid story behind it that is actually pretty good.\n\nCharacter choices are neat, but nothing fancy.

Then there is also multiplayer, but most of the servers were taken down long ago. But you can always play with friends by putting in passwords. Then you and your friends, or possably NPCs, you can cut people with your lightsaber, shoot aliens in the face with blasters, and push your enemies using the force. You can also go to jediknight3.filefront you can get mods for the game to let you be people like Altair, Darth Maul, and even Link!

Besides lightsabers, it also has a bunch of guns from the Star Wars universe as well, if you're more into shooting.\n\nThe singleplayer storyline may seem a bit weak in comparison to the predecessor Jedi Knight games, though that's just general opinion. I personally enjoy going through the singleplayer quite a lot. In any case, an improved lightsaber combat, high moddability and great multiplayer action more than makes up for the flaws.\n\nGraphics-wise, Jedi Academy isn't exactly up to par with the modern games, however with the release of Jedi Outcast and Jedi Academy's source codes, we can expect the graphics to be improved by the modding community. The folks at JKHub[jkhub.org], for instance, are working on implementing rend2 (the renderer of the newer ioquake3 game engine).\n\nRegarding mods, I seriously suggest Movie Battles II[moviebattles.com]. Been playing it for years, and to tell the truth, I hardly touched the base Jedi Academy's multiplayer after starting this mod up.\n\nIf you're into sword combat, like to freely control your character's movements or just looking for an action Star Wars game, do yourself a favor and try Jedi Academy out.","March 17, 2014","true","343.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

He started playing it and I would watch him play, it was incredible. I'll never forget when I first played it I was hooked.\n\nThis game delivers intense action that is just all around a good time. The fighting mechanics are simple enough where you don't need to be an expert to have fun, but at the same time it will take you a long time to master certain features and fighting styles.

For this alone, they are worth playing.\n\nSingle player acts as a fun introduction to gameplay and provides all the tools needed (at a good pace) for moving on to the engaging multiplayer, which is truly where the game shines.\nIf you get bored with the default game (unlikely), then it's most popular modification, 'Movie Battles II' kicks it up a notch in a class based siege style gameplay true to the movies. Different features, equally competitive and satisfying.\n\nIf you want more acrobatic swordplay and are tired of the alternative's (Chivalry:Medieval Warfare / War of the Vikings) equally solid but slower pace, this is the one to try.","March 10, 2015","true","3.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You'll also get to visit some iconic locations and meet some of iconic characters. There are some really exhilirating moments throughout the story! The story is good, yet a bit basic. Also, there was a plot twist that I didn't get because I didn't play any of the previous games but that is minor.

Released in 2003 but the modding community is still very active. Even though the single player game is short, it is very enjoyable to play with it's fun combat and different level designs. It gets harder into the game as you fight lightsaber users.\n\nOnce you have complete the single player (or you do not have to), download MovieBattles 2. It is what the game now is all about as the vanilla multiplayer is dead.\n\nMovieBattles 2 is loads better with better modded maps throughout the StarWars saga. Now with the enhanced combat system is even more enjoyable to play for both shooting and lightsaber combats. More characters to play as from clone troopers, Darth Maul, wookies and even more in multiplayer deathmatch games. Do you like fighting others with lightsabers? Join in a duel server and challenge other jedis or siths in a lightsaber duel and beat each other over countless of hours!\n\nOverall this game is fantastic to play only with MovieBattles 2 as the vanilla game has aged and is dead. I really recommend this game to either StarWars fan or a non fan after a huge disappointment over the release of Battlefront game. Jedi Academy is the real and the best StarWars game out there.","January 11","true","79.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Blasters are completely useless as you get a lightsaber in this game as you get a lightsaber immediatly unlike Jedi Outcast and Dark Forces 2.  You can choose Jaden Korrs apperance at the beggining of the game, you can make him a Rodian, a Human male or female, a Zabrak female only witch is kinda a turn off for being like Darth Maul, and last but not least a Kel Dor Witch if that does not ring a bell is Plo Koons Species witch I think is REALLY cool. Other than that gameplay is the same.\n\nCharacters: The characters well kinda...Suck. Kyle Katarn is not even like kyle katarn, he is a jedi master now witch is not the kyle katarn we know and love, there are moments when he is acting like a human but other times he acts like a robot with a kyle katarn voice, Luke Skywalker is in this, he does not really have much to do with this game other than he is the main boss guy of the Jedi Academy witch makes sense because he is the one who created the New Jedi Order. And jaden korr who is really just a robot with no emotion oh and I almost forgot, Rosh Penin, a ♥♥♥ hole version of jar jar binks, fun right?\n\n\nGraphics: They are the same as jedi outcast since it uses the same Engine. They added a few extra effects but nothing special, but of 2003 Its graphics kinda fall flat on its face compared to the graphics of KOTOR.\n\nCommunity: I have never really reviewed a games community. But I must say all of the bad things about this game the community makes up for it, the mulitply is amazing and the modding OH THE MODDING its amazing, this game has been modded in every single way, dont like luke skywalkers model WELL THERE IS A REPLACEMENT that looks like it came out of a modern game, there are total conversions like Movie Battles 2 witch takes a counter strike approach to the multiplayer with different classes like Mandalorian and Jedi Or Bounty hunter. Its community is AMAZING but sadley the community has nothing to do with the ACTUAL game, meaning I have to judge Vinnila Jedi Academy.\n\nSo I give plain Jedi Academy 6.5 out of 10.\n\nBut I give Modded Jedi Academy 9/10","February 8, 2014","true","463.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Battlefront and Force Unleashed were the closest in the Star Wars universe and others have tried in other universes with similar concepts but none of them touch the feel of this game in my opinion. I have played them all extensively and I still come back to this one when I really want to swing a saber and throw some fools off a ledge with Grip or Lightning. The movement and Force Powers all feel just right and the varied move sets based on saber stances/styles are endlessly adaptable to make for a unique fight every time - or you can find one trick you love and use it till your fingers grow arthritic.\n\nThat brings me to the second strongest aspects: It was one of the first games to successfully implement environment running once you level up a bit (aka Jedi parkour). You can hop around, wall run, and just generally be a badass both in and out of fights. The missions are all in unique locations that capture the feel of the universe and provide unique experiences. The graphics and physics have held up well all things considered - at the time they were incredible. That isn't to say there aren't flaws, but nothing game breaking that I have found and generally lots of fun.\n\nThe biggest weakness: The story line is a bit predictable but I honestly don't care one tiny bit. The general idea and delivery is good enough for me. If you are expecting something that will cause you to do some serious soul searching, this is probably not going to be the place to find it, but there are two endings for a bit of variety.\n\nOverall I would strongly recommend this game because it delivers on what it tries to deliver on - great gameplay in a fast paced lightsaber/force using environment with a million different ways to approach any fight.","November 24, 2014","true","22.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I was playing this game when I was a child, it was about 6-7 years ago. As I can remember, I enjoyed it very much! When I was playing it this time, I enjoyed it not less, except that I had a feeling of nostalgia somehow.\n\nTo tell the truth, I can assure that Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy is THE BEST game in Star Wars series. Here you can wave your lightsaber. Here you can use the Force. The other “lightsaber fights” games are rewritten from this one. As we can see, Jedi Academy is truly a “standard”. =)\n\nAnd no one cares that this game is more than 10 years old! Everything old is new again, after all.\n\nBy the way, if you beat company and still didn’t become a true Jedi, this game has a fascinating multiplayer. It consists from nice and cosy fights with other members of Star Wars community, just like you. Actually, there are no more than 2,000 active players, because not everyone still remember how to deal with lightsaber. Nevertheless, you’ll not be bored, I promise.","May 21, 2015","true","12.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

You'll need a few unoffical files to get it running, but afterwards, it's fine.\n\nFor a dated game, you'll notice that the game doesn't have HD graphics or anything. But any Star Wars fan (such as myself) will tell you that these Jedi Knight games developed by Raven are, by far, the best Star Wars games out there. The lightsaber combat is engaging and you can run around with a single lightsaber with your choice of fighting style, use dual-wield lightsabers, or channel your inner Darth Maul and use a staff. There's a plethora of force powers to use, even the movie ones such as Jedi Mind Trick and Force Choke. While the multiplayer side is most likely dead, the singleplayer experience is fine on its own.\n\nBut the best part is the modding community. Adding mods is almost as easy as downloading files from the Steam Workshop, and Star Wars fans are probably the most creative people out there. You can play as Darth Vader for your Sith needs, or give the game a comedic effect and saber people as Homer Simpson, Duffman, or even Bender. There is a singleplayer mod that allows you to romp around as Jack Sparrow. If you wish the game had more up-to-date graphics, somebody has created an HD texture overhaul, and there is also a Widescreen mod to make the game fit a 1920x1080 monitor properly.\n\nOverall, I give this game a 9/10. It's definitely a unique experience with or without mods and even if you aren't a fan of Star Wars, you can still have a great time with this game. If you love Star Wars, you'll love this.\n\nOh, and grab the source code. What is in there is hilarious.","January 24, 2015","true","80.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game has a nice story, playing as an unknown jedi wannabe with a lightsaber as you train to become a jedi master one day. The online gameplay is great, with the game usually having a great fanbase who after 12 years are still playing this game religiously. For those who don't want to fight with only lightsabers, there is a nice selection of other weapons as well (I reccomend the disruper rifle. That's my personal favorite). Because this game is 12 years old, it can run well on almost any computer you install it on, but the graphics are still really good for how old it is.

Fortunately, you only use a vehicle twice in the game, and it's optional one of those times.\n\n•As I mentioned earlier, the character customization felt a little restricted. For some odd reason, the genders are tied onto the species, which means you can't have a male Zabrak(Darth Maul's species) or a female Keldor(Plo Koon's species).\n\n•The lip-sync is pretty bad, and so is Luke's voice actor, but these were only minor annoyances.\n\nI highly recommend this game, and I guarantee you'll love it.

And even though, Force Unleashed might seem to be epic, the gameplay isn't really that good and the fighting scenes just suck in my opinion (no freedom).\n\nAnyway, if you want to play a good Star Wars - "Jedi oriented" game, you should totally buy or download Jedi Outcast and Jedi Academy.\n\nscore: 95/100\n\nps. if you wanna setup graphics to 1920x1080 you have to rewrite the config (youtube will help)","January 21","true","9.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

First I'll talk about the base game itself.\n\nThe base game is very intriguing, with great saber combat, accompanied by optional,  yet good, blaster combat in either 1st or 3rd person. There are multiple upgradable force powers that are actually very useful and fun to use. The story is great, following Episode 6 of Star Wars. There are even a couple of moral choices you get to make. Overall the base game is great, and is well worth the 10 bucks.\n\nBut now for the real reason I've racked up over 100 hours. (more technically)\nMoviebattles 2...\nWhat is moviebattles, you may ask? Well I'll be happy to answer that question for you. Moviebattles is a mod for Jedi Academy, that completely overhault the entire multiplayer experience. It makes lightsaber combat incredibly realistic, and makes blasters an actually pheasable weapon in multiplayer. Moviebattles has a few different modes. I'll talk about 3 of them to keep this short. The first is the most popular... Open. Open is a two team class battle. There are 6 or so classes for the republic/rebellion, and for the empire/cis. Things like Jedi, Sith, Wookies, Mandalorians, Bounty Hunters, etc. The list goes on. It's an elimination/objective game mode. The two teams fight it out until one team has no players left alive, or the attacking team successfully achieves the objective/the defending team successfully defends the objective.\n\nThe second game mode, is called Duel. It's by far my favorite. The teams in this don't matter. It's a free-for-all match in which Jedi and Sith alike use only their saber skills, and force powers to defeat each other. You can respawn in this gamemode. The only thing about it, is that it's a "Duel". Not a "massacre". Meaning you can't go around fighting people while they're fighting other people.\n\nOverall, this mod has completely rebuilt Jedi Academy, in a way I've really enjoyed. I have at least 300 hours in this game. (seeing as they changed to their own launcher during one update, so I stopped using steam to launch the game)\n\nJedi Academy: 9/10\nMoviebattles 2: 11/10\n\nBoth highly recommended.","December 3, 2015","true","153.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is from 2003 and I still play this and enjoying it way more than the new Battlefront. Why you may ask? Let me start of with the lightsaber combat in this game is really nice, unlike Battlefront where you get pushed back everytime and can't do anything but get killed. If you're playing Multiplayer and fights another player with a lightsaber it can go on forever if you both know how to use it. It takes skill, took me a couple of hours to learn how to use a Lightsaber properly without getting killed instantly. If you're planning on playing the Multiplayer in this game but you're not good at using the lightsaber I highly recommend you downloading the "Movie Battles 2" mod. It has a lot of the characters from Star Wars in it, you can play as clone/Storm troopers, Bounty hunters, droids, Jedi and Sith etc... And it has some nice character customization (Change color, lightsaber). If you ask me if this game is worth buying I'd say: Yes absolutely!

Fortunately, you only use a vehicle twice in the game, and it's optional one of those times.\n\n•As I mentioned earlier, the character customization felt a little restricted. For some odd reason, the genders are tied onto the species, which means you can't have a male Zabrak(Darth Maul's species) or a female Keldor(Plo Koon's species).\n\n•The lip-sync is pretty bad, and so is Luke's voice actor, but these were only minor annoyances.\n\nI highly recommend this game, and I guarantee you'll love it.

Want to use a blaster the entire time?  Go ahead! Want to use a lightsaber the entire time? Sure thing!  You can play it pretty much how you want.  While the lightsaber combat isn't the best, you can't expect too much given this games age.  Speaking of game age, it'd be unfair for me to try and criticize this game for its graphics, combat, voice, etc.\n\nI thoroughy enjoyed playing this game, and will continue to play it.  It's just very satisfying to kill everything and anything with your lightsaber, just like it's fun to force choke or grip your enemies.  It was actually very satisfying to force choke people. (I'm a Jedi who loves force choke...sue me!)\nJedi Academy is definitely one of those games you have to play if you're a Star Wars fan. 10/10.","February 21","true","14.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You get your ightsaber from the start and have a decent amount of customization. The story is weak and is just there so you have a reason for doing what your doing, if you want a good story play jedi outcast.

Fortunately, you only use a vehicle twice in the game, and it's optional one of those times.\n\n•As I mentioned earlier, the character customization felt a little restricted. For some odd reason, the genders are tied onto the species, which means you can't have a male Zabrak(Darth Maul's species) or a female Keldor(Plo Koon's species).\n\n•The lip-sync is pretty bad, and so is Luke's voice actor, but these were only minor annoyances.\n\nI highly recommend this game, and I guarantee you'll love it.

In our server we would call them our masters and you would have to show respect.\nThe mechanics are incredible, there are infinite combinations and techniques to outmatch your opponent. Single player doesn't really matter. It's all about the multiplayer and committing yourself to get better and better at being a jedi. It's like a rpg but you don't get upgrades or increase level, you evolve and learn by yourself, an "academy" in it's truest sense.\nSimply amazing even to this day, it's old I know, but the fact that many servers still manage to survive justifies my review.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jovack/recommended/6020/","jovack","The Counter of Strikes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jovack/","268 products in account","A great Star Wars combat game where you can play from the perspective of a Jedi.\n\nMulti-player wise, this game is superior to Jedi Knight 2: Jedi Outcast, however, since multi-player is now rare, the single player although good, was not better than Jedi Outcast (which had better pacing, and a better plot -- it felt more like the original films, whereas this game feels more like the prequels in tone). This game allows you to have a double saber, or hold 2 light-sabers, and there are a few more force powers (nothing significant). However, for some reason, the saber combat in Jedi Outcast felt tighter; in Jedi Academy, each of the saber styles have new "special moves" but they are more acrobatic than useful, they look cool, but end up being sluggish and will get you insta killed on the highest difficulty.\n\nJedi Outcast's campaign is more like a movie (intro, rising action, climax, etc), whereas this game opts to give you more freedom -- not only in creating a character and saber choice, but in the missions you take on. Of course, this freedom comes at the cost of sacrificing a story in favour of just throwing random missions at you. After a set of missions, you're forced to take on a 'main' mission which will propel the story forward... there is SOME semblence of story, but again, nowhere near the pacing of Jedi Outcast.  However, this game does have some interesting choices that you can make (minor spoiler, light side/dark side) which will change the last set of missions/final battle/ending scene (each with their own pros and cons...)\n\nRegardless, this is a great game that holds up despite being a bit aged. You'll feel like a Jedi badass and that's all it needs to do.\n\nIf you want a game with a lot of choices where you can role play as a Jedi, taking on various missions, etc, then this game is great.\nIf you want a well paced and tight story, with simpler but tighter gameplay, Jedi Knight 2: Jedi Outcast is the game for that.\n\nI would recommend both for any fan of the Star Wars mythos. These games do a good job of taking care of the "Jedi Knight, light-saber, blasters etc, force powers combat niche).","April 27, 2015","true","19.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Star Wars is great on its own. But I'm here today to talk about the final game in the Jedi Knight Saga. Jedi Academy.\n\nJedi Academy starts off with you creating your character. There are a few lightsaber colours and hilts to choose from, but nothing much. You can customise your character and change them to one of six races, three being Male and three being Female. After you have created your character, lightsaber and everything, you find yourself on a shuttle. That shuttle gets shot down and you crash. And guess what - the person you just met came out with you. Makes sense, doesn't it?\n\nSo, you make your way to the Jedi Temple, and here is where the game really begins. After a training session with Kyle Katarn, your Jedi instructor and protagonist of the prequel, you are given a set of six missions. There are three sets of these missions throughout the game. The first ones are easy, the second ones are harder, and the last one is just too hard. But I don't mind, seeing as I have finished the game 11 or 12 times. ;D\n\nThe final level *SPOILER* is you venturing through the catacombs trying to find Tavion (main villain of the game). In the previous level, you can choose whether to go with the Dark Side or stay on the Good Side. If you choose Dark Side, it durastically increases the difficulty of the level. EVERYONE is against you. Not one life form on that level is with you. And then in the boss fight, you fight Tavion and kill her, and then Katarn. (Tavion is trying to revive Ractos (I think it's Ractos)) If you choose the Good Side, then the Jedi are on your side and help you fight the Sith. The final boss is Tavion then Ractos's spirit going inside her...O_O And then you defeat her(him...hehehe) and then blah blah blah you win the game thanks for playing credits.\n\n*SUMMARY*\nJedi Academy in my opinion is the greatest Star Wars game. EVER. I give it a 10/10. It's a game from my childhood, what can I say? So learn the force, craft a saber, go out there and stop Tavion!","January 22, 2014","true","121.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/oldsoulmcmxciii/recommended/6020/","oldsoulmcmxciii","Oldest Soul","http://steamcommunity.com/id/oldsoulmcmxciii/","181 products in account","OVERVIEW: 8/10\n\nI will warn you, this is a fairly long review :)\n\nI originally owned this game on the first Xbox, where it was one of my most played games. While being backwards compatible with the Xbox 360 the game does not natively support a 360 controller, however, third party software such as Xpadder may be used to get around this, although there seems to be an issue with the game's use of the x-axis.\n\nThe story itself takes place after the Jedi Outcast games (which unfortunately I never played) with the player taking the role of an upcoming student under the tutilage of Kyle Katarn (protagonist of previous Jedi Knight games) at Luke Skywalker's academy on Yavin 4.\n\nWhile the voice acting is sub-par, the game quickly gives you the ability to complete missions in the order of your chosing as well as allowing you to utilise different means to dispatch enemies. This means that despite being a Jedi padawan, the game still gives you the option of engaging with your enemies using weapons such as a blaster pistol or a bowcaster, as well as thermal detonators and trip mines. Combining these tools with force powers such as Grip, Pull and Push allow you to be 'creative' in your manner of killing.\n\nAll of this 'freedom' however is within a linear sandbox. The missions themselves dont all feel sequential and thus disconnected from the others, almost as if they are merely fillers between the main story missions. You could alternatively state that this is done in order to create an 'authentic' experience; under the guise of allowing you to choose the order of the missions given to you, the missions act as a means of learning how to effectively utilise the skills you have in order to be successful in the main missions which drive forward the narrative. As the story does progress, players have to option to level up force powers from both the Light and Dark sides respectively, which depending on which abilities you mostly use in a mission, earns a comment from either Luke or Kyle about how your objective was met. What I percieved to be the pinnacle of the game was when you accquired max level in all of your neutral force powers; at this time you were given the option to use a single, dual or a double bladed lightsaber - giving you access to amazingly stylised combinations of attack.\n\nMultiplayer on this game is a confusing one for me. While it does support local bot play, there are some issues with connecting to servers. These range from not actually being able to find any, to the game freezing while you try to connect to one. Some of these issues may be due to either the server or the client your using having mods which conflict installed - this brings me to another point; mod support.\n\nAn outdated game such as this may turn people off solely due to the graphics. Well, for those that find this an issue, there are retexture packs out there for you to use install which do boost up the games appearance. There are also numerous mods for the game aswell; Movie Battles II and Knights of the Force are two I highly recommend you check out, as these increase the customisation of the lightsabers as well as giving you access to both locations and characters from the films.\n\nOverall, I give this game an 8 out of 10. It's not the best Star Wars game I've played (that title belongs to KotOR) but it was the first Star Wars game I played which felt like I had a variety of ways to complete my objectives. For its time the combat was brilliant and provides an authentic Jedi experience.\n\nWARNING: Towards the later stages of the game, players are faced with a choice (don't worry I wont spoil what it is). This choice however, appeared on screen in small text and for a short period of time. This may not be the case for the PC port, but I'd thought I'd give you a heads up in advance.","December 3, 2013","true","2.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Owlakki/recommended/6020/","Owlakki","Owlakki™ 5 days til birthday","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Owlakki/","441 products in account","Jedi Academy is a game I look upon with reverence very frequently. It's the first game I ever clocked more then 300 hours into and was largely the reason I became a PC gamer in the first place.\n\nThe singleplayer is unfortunately the weakest part about the game, and is the weakest in the series thus far. Instead of playing as series protagonist Kyle Katarn, you're dopey a student of his. In general it's a fairly weak story with not so great characters. On the flipside though it has great map design, and it has an extremely satisfying Dark Side ending that even features a different final boss.\n\nWhere this game shines the most is in it's multiplayer. They expanded the multiplayer of Jedi Outcast to the point of utter perfection. The Quake 3 engine was almost pushed to it's limits with this game. It was elegant, masterful, and truly one of my favorite games of all time. However that was then, this is now. And unfortunately the multiplayer community now is a shadow of it's former self. It's a tragic story that extends to the rest of the series, since it never continued past this game.\n\nI would still recommend this game though as the first one to try out. Since it is the easiest game to get into as a newcomer to the franchise. It lets you jump straight into the lightsaber combat (as opposed to Dark Forces 2 and Jedi Outcast where you don't unlock the lightsaber until a few levels in) and features the most refined lightsaber combat in the entire series.","March 13, 2013","true","21.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The story is ... okay, I guess? It's not bad but it's no BioWare KOTOR epic story. Whatever. It's got some interesting (no longer canon, thanks Disney) stuff about ancient Sith Lords that's cool if you're into (no-longer-canon) lore. The graphics are pretty good, especially for a 2003 game they've held up pretty well.\n\nBut the game is really significant for one very important reason. No Star Wars game before or since has ever captured the feeling of wielding a lightsaber as well as this one. You know, that thing all of us who have ever seen a Star Wars movie have always dreamed of? This is the game that does it best. Other Star Wars games at best make you feel like you're wielding a regular sword that's been given a Star Wars mod. In Jedi Academy, I felt like I was truly wielding a deadly beam of light. I'm a traditional one-saber kind of gal myself, but I also love how the game put real thought into developing fighting styles for wielding 2 lightsabers or a double-bladed Darth Maul style saber as well.\n\nI also really like the ability to choose between a variety of missions instead of being forced along a totally strict linear path. It's not anywhere near total sandbox freedom, but being able to quit out of a frustrating mission and try a different one instead is nice.\n\ntl;dr: THE BEST LIGHTSABER COMBAT IN ANY STAR WARS GAME EVER","May 7","true","9.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

But many people for some reason want to make STAR WARS a bloody gore-fest! I dont understand this, and the reason why is the weapons that are used in STAR WARS are laser induced plasma based and because they are it would mean that there would be gore to a certain degree, but no blood (Because a lightsaber for example would be so hot it would CAUTERIZE the wound in question, it would be the same for blasters and such BUT not gamorian vibro axes but they are not used by anyone else really so we dont have to worry about that).

For example: "Quake" for the xbox 360 was one of the most painful games I've ever played, and I only continued the game because I was an achievement ♥♥♥♥♥.  It would get a 1/10.\n*By "Memorability" I mean the extent to which my life was made richer by experiencing this game, i.e., was this a game that I'll be thinking about and talking about with friends years down the road?\n*By "Time Debt" I mean the extent to which I believe this game was worth the time it took to beat the game, i.e., in hindsight would I agree that there were no other things I would've rather spent my 10+ hours on?\n\nNotable Mentions:\n-Occasionally there are areas/levels which have repetative audio segments, which can get really annoying. (Looking at you Blenjeel merchant rescue!!!)\n-There seems to be an instant jump in difficulty midway through the game.  Not necessarily a bad thing, just different from the usual.\n-Force Lightning.  Always a good decision, regardless of star wars game. Hah\n-I went through the game using mostly a lightsaber.  On normal difficulty, lightsaber combat was really just kind of hack & slash with little thought needed.  On normal, it's very much so a scratch-ur-balls-while-playing kind of game.\n\nAll these ratings are based on 2016 expectations.  For its time I believe this game could've easily been an 8/10 or higher.","May 13","false","10.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You're able to use a wide selection of iconic starwars weapons like blaster rifles and thermal detonaters. You are also able to use a single saber, dual sabers, and a saber staff (double bladed hilt) and each has pros and cons, making you able to be just as effective with each. You are also able to customize your force powers  giving it slight RPG feel, and you can have access potentially to all the good stuff.

For the most part the game is fun but there are moments where I wanted to rage quit.\nFirstly, the enemies. Basic gun enemies (strom troopers etc.) quickly become easy to kill and pose no challenge after a few missions. Enemies with lightsabres are another story, they can use every power you can making them pretty much your equal, what isn't equal is when you have to fight multiple at once. At several points in the game, the game expected me to take on 5 enemy jedi at once (so I ran past them), but the most frustrating thing is when you kill them. Every time you kill an enemy jedi with your lightsabre, the game decides to do a full 360 spin of your player. It looks cool at first but it wears off quickly and if you kill one enemy jedi when another one is about to attack you, you have to dodge by mmoving, but since the camera is doing a 360 spin, moving in the right direction is hard to do.\nSecondly, the force powers. You get given powers like force push, pull, jump etc. given to you at the start of the game and they level up those skills as you progress through the story. Then there are other force powers that you can choose to level up before each misson (cure, lightning, shield etc.). Each force power has 3 levels, some powers are very overpowered and others are totally useless (just be sure to experiment with every force power). The other problem is that your force is limited by a constantly recharging metre. But this metre charges very slowly and when using some powers, it doesn't charge at all, a lot of my time in the game was hitting an enemy with force lightning, running round until my metre recharged and repeating, I would have prefered the metre recharge quicker to make combat flow better.\nThere's also a lot of little things like enemies insulting you because you ran away to recharge your force or to avoid combat (and it's made even worse since the enemies can shout at you from a really far distance)\nThat said, there are still some fun and fair challenges during the middle part of the game and there are cool tricks you can do    like throwing your lightsabre and juming up walls (a lot of these special abilities take a while to master).\nPeople who love Star Wars will like this game more than other people, just be ready for rage (and don't be ashamed to use a walkthrough)\nOverall an good game 6.5/10","January 28, 2014","true","10.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You can do it in this game! (with cheats though). Also, this game has a rather interesting single player story mode I played through multiple times and sank approximately 40 hours into.\n\nClick here for an Under 5 Min Review of this game!\n\nPros:\n1. You can be a Jedi! Also, it has Kyle Katarn and Luke Skywalker in it!\n2. A plethora of mods!\n3. Although the story is linear, the levels offer a variety of experiences (crashlanding on a planet and repairing your ship, while trying to escape a sand worm; fighting Boba Fett; disarming a bomb-rigged train; speeder chase, and many other routine adventures a Jedi Padawan/Knight goes through)\n4. Awesome acrobatics, swordsplay and Force powers, which feel way more fluid and natural to the game than the guns.\n5. Great sandboxing potential of both SP and MP. You think this plain on Tatooine would make a great battlefield? Spawn in Boba Fett and 3 Kyle Katarns and see who wins, then spawn in 20 Boba Fetts and 60 Kyles. (spoiler: Boba Fett wins every time, since he's immortal). Would you make this roof to roof jump on the moving train if you had a speeder with you? Spawn in a speeder and try it out!\n6. There is an active multiplayer community and the sandbox is real on the servers (there are banks, quests and other different RPG-ish kinds of stuff). There are some classic FFA, TDM or CTF servers too. While the sandbox is something very interesting and unique to this game, I can't really say it was that big of a deal for me.\n\nCons:\n1. Dated graphics and cinematics.\n2. Very predictable and linear story.\n3. Gunplay is pretty subpar, compared to lightsaber combat and Force powers.\n4. Possible compatibility problems with Windows 7/8. Also, some tinkering is required before you can set it to 16:9.\n\nThis is one of the games, that aged really well, considering it's over 10 years old. If older graphics are a problem for you, there are mods partially fixing them, as well as adding a bunch of new things to the game.\n\nThe most fun I've had with this game was either by spawning in enemies and allies and organising battles royale, or trying to get speeder jumps in original places (for example a roof to roof jump on the moving train level).\n\nI return to this game every now and then for the great lightsaberplay and to have some fun cheating in enemies and vehicles.\n\nYou might encounter compatibility problems, so purchase at your own risk!\n\nVerdict: 9/10 - Would get choked by Kyle Katarn again (no homo).","April 8, 2015","true","10.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Also, I STILL dont know what a Star Wars is, or why it is in all capitals, but I enjoyed the game none the less.\n\nAnother part of the game that is very enjoyable is the combat system, using farts as a propellant/transport for your character is very innovative and I have taken to even using this method in real life.  This game has overall changed my life, I just cant get enough of it and this game will probably continue to be my most played game untill I die.\n\nI 100% recomend SPACE BATTLEZ Star Knight - Astronaut Academy for fans of games like Hatoful Boyfriend, Castle Crashers, and Sexfriend Ultimate 2012.","June 24, 2015","true","0.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

You can do it in this game! (with cheats though). Also, this game has a rather interesting single player story mode I played through multiple times and sank approximately 40 hours into.\n\nClick here for an Under 5 Min Review of this game!\n\nPros:\n1. You can be a Jedi! Also, it has Kyle Katarn and Luke Skywalker in it!\n2. A plethora of mods!\n3. Although the story is linear, the levels offer a variety of experiences (crashlanding on a planet and repairing your ship, while trying to escape a sand worm; fighting Boba Fett; disarming a bomb-rigged train; speeder chase, and many other routine adventures a Jedi Padawan/Knight goes through)\n4. Awesome acrobatics, swordsplay and Force powers, which feel way more fluid and natural to the game than the guns.\n5. Great sandboxing potential of both SP and MP. You think this plain on Tatooine would make a great battlefield? Spawn in Boba Fett and 3 Kyle Katarns and see who wins, then spawn in 20 Boba Fetts and 60 Kyles. (spoiler: Boba Fett wins every time, since he's immortal). Would you make this roof to roof jump on the moving train if you had a speeder with you? Spawn in a speeder and try it out!\n6. There is an active multiplayer community and the sandbox is real on the servers (there are banks, quests and other different RPG-ish kinds of stuff). There are some classic FFA, TDM or CTF servers too. While the sandbox is something very interesting and unique to this game, I can't really say it was that big of a deal for me.\n\nCons:\n1. Dated graphics and cinematics.\n2. Very predictable and linear story.\n3. Gunplay is pretty subpar, compared to lightsaber combat and Force powers.\n4. Possible compatibility problems with Windows 7/8. Also, some tinkering is required before you can set it to 16:9.\n\nThis is one of the games, that aged really well, considering it's over 10 years old. If older graphics are a problem for you, there are mods partially fixing them, as well as adding a bunch of new things to the game.\n\nThe most fun I've had with this game was either by spawning in enemies and allies and organising battles royale, or trying to get speeder jumps in original places (for example a roof to roof jump on the moving train level).\n\nI return to this game every now and then for the great lightsaberplay and to have some fun cheating in enemies and vehicles.\n\nYou might encounter compatibility problems, so purchase at your own risk!\n\nVerdict: 9/10 - Would get choked by Kyle Katarn again (no homo).","April 8, 2015","true","10.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Also, I STILL dont know what a Star Wars is, or why it is in all capitals, but I enjoyed the game none the less.\n\nAnother part of the game that is very enjoyable is the combat system, using farts as a propellant/transport for your character is very innovative and I have taken to even using this method in real life.  This game has overall changed my life, I just cant get enough of it and this game will probably continue to be my most played game untill I die.\n\nI 100% recomend SPACE BATTLEZ Star Knight - Astronaut Academy for fans of games like Hatoful Boyfriend, Castle Crashers, and Sexfriend Ultimate 2012.","June 24, 2015","true","0.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

I can personally say that this game features one of the most diverse and enjoyable leveling experience that I have ever had the privilege to enjoy. Not only does it feature complex puzzle and mechanics, but it has incredible combat as it is powered by the Quake 3 engine. Not only does this make for a boredom-free leveling experience, but it is also allows for some of the most challenging and entertaining PvP. While the combat is superior to it's predecessor due to brand new combos, force abilities, and the addition of Jar'Kai duel wielding and double-bladed saber staffs, the story is very much lacking as it is cluttered with plot holes and meaningless absurd plot devices. Fortunately, the positives of this game easily out-weigh the awful story. As a whole this game is an incredible feat, let alone for something made over a decade ago and is certainly worth the minimal fee of $10. In addition to this game I'd like to recommend a few other classic Star Wars titles including: Knights of the Old Republic, KotOR: the Sith Lords, Battlefront 2, and the rest of the Dark Forces series if you are into older games. I also recommend a mod called "Jedi Outcast - Academy mod" Which can be found on moddb.com and allows you to play the full Jedi Outcast campaign on the updated Jedi Academy engine. With that I leave you, and remember the Dark Side has cookies and force lightning is over-powered. >:D\n","June 14, 2014","true","73.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/The_Hinsonator/recommended/6020/","The_Hinsonator","Hinsonator","http://steamcommunity.com/id/The_Hinsonator/","252 products in account","This game is a classic, one of the best Star Wars games ever made.\nYou play as Jaden Korr starting off as a Jedi Padawan and as you play through the game you become a Jedi Knight or Master, the game is based along the same storyline as the Dark Forces games and like the Dark Forces games it's based after the Galactic Civil War between the Rebelion and the Galactic (Sith) Empire of course if you've seen the movies you'll know the Rebels win and they form The New Republic, because of how few Jedi are left and there are even less Jedi Masters some students were asigned more than one master, Jaden and another Jedi Padawan Rosh Penin under the jedi master Kyle Katarn.\nThe story says you are a Human Male but you can chose to be a Kel Dor male, a Rodian Male, a Female Human, Twi'lek and Zabrak changing your race doesn't change how you sound, you will always have one of two voices, aswell as that you can customize your lightsaber, this game has the second best or the best lightsaber customization to Star Wars Galaxies, again the story says Jaden has a purple lightsaber but you can change the colour if you want, but in singleplayer he can't have a red lightsaber, you can also choose from a few handles for each saber, one is the saber Anikan uses and another is the one Obi Wan uses, aswell as a single saber you can use duel sabers and a saber stalf saber stalfs have their own unique handles too, chosing duel sabers or a saber stalf over a single saber does seem cool but the single sabers are more flexible with three attack modes, light medium and heavy each with their strengths and weaknesses.\nThe story of the Dark Forces games is probably one giant "What If" scenario, what if Anakin didn't wipe out all the Jedi in the temple what if he missed a few and they escaped? even though irionically his son Luke, (with the help of his badass buddy Kyle Katarn) trains these people to (most likely) become amazing jedi.\nLike most to all jedi-themed classic Star Wars games you can chose to be good or bad, i will not explain in this review for spoiler reasons how to chose your side and how it will end.\nMultiplayer is very much like Quake 3 only with three types of grenades, the ability to use the force and customize your lightsaber and of course you can chose a red blade.\nLike Quake 3 you can chose from a large nomber of characters from the Dark Forces games even people you don't see in Jedi Academy aswell as your own characters, the character creation is exactly the same as in singleplayer.\nYou can chose to be focused arround dark side powers or light side powers not both, each side has their own unique team power in the team-based games, some powers act differently to how they do in singleplayer and you can have power "loadouts" making it easier to change power builds.\nThere are six game modes, Deathmatch, TDM, Duel, Power Duel, Capture the Flag and a class based Siege gamemode.\nDeathmatch and TDM are basically the same as always, your cloths and saber is coloured based on what team you are on and in TDM you can chose to have it light powers vs dark powers, the first team to hit the score limit or the team with the most score when the time runs out wins.\nDuel is also very self explanatory, a good old 1-on-1 battle Power Duel is 2-on-1 but the person by himself gets a few advantiges to even things out, you can chose to have weapons or go lightsaber only, lightsaber only is probably the best choice for duels since there aren't any weapons or powerups inside the arena, the person who hits the win limit or has the most wins... well wins.\nCapture the flag is what it always has been, if you've played Quake 2, 3, any Untral Torunament or Metal Techs 4 through to 7 (the Tribes games) you'll know what it is, like all team gmaes in Jedi Academy and most team-based games/gamemodes there are two teams.\nIn Siege there is an attacking team and a defending team. The attackers have to make their way through the base and the defenders have to stop this, i havn't played much of siege persenally but i know that it has vehicles and it's class based with no AI, vehicles and mounted guns.\nAlso you don't have to have a lightsaber in Multiplayer for those who want a little bit of an extra chalange, and play agenst players since the AI aren't that smart even on the Jedi Master difficulty.\n\nIf your Star Wars dream was to become a Jedi i hightly reccomend this game aswell as that it's an awesome game in general, there aren't many Star Wars gems like this anymore since EA owns the rights to the Star Wars games so we must enjoy the few we have left.","January 13, 2014","true","21.2"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/recommended/6020/","Brian_Colfxire","Brian C. (The Schmaltzy Cynic)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/","468 products in account","Honestly, I didn't expect to enjoy Jedi Academy as much as I did. Like with Jedi Outcast, I simply don't think it lives up to the quality of Dark Forces 1 or 2.\n\nThis is not to say the game is bad. Jedi Academy is definitely an improvement compared to (Dark Forces 3) Jedi Knight 2: Jedi Outcast for Raven Software, but I can't help but wonder if the game is simply too shallow for me to enjoy.\n\nThe multiplayer, however, I can see as being enjoyable if I had friends to enjoy that content, so if you want the best Jedi Knight multiplayer community and mod-support, then this is definitely your game.\n\nThe Star Wars Fan-Fiction Simulator\nI say this with all good intentions. Ironically, as I found Outcast's reliance on the lore my main gripe, the reliance on the lore is what makes Jedi Academy entertaining.\n\nYou choose a template of characters, outfits and lightsabers--for some reason each alien species is set for one gender--and revist locations of the movies. You'll fight alongside heroes like Chewbacca, Kyle Katarn, Luke Skywalker. You'll fight against the snow Yeti's from Hoth, Boba Fett and the Sith Apprentice from Outcast.\n\nWhile I hate how the series has become more fan-service than creating original characters and stories, I can't deny there is something to enjoy in buddying up with your favorite hero. To make up for the lack in creativity, the level design (and variety) are what makes this change bearable.\n\nNot only will you have a more colorful variety of locals, but the mission-structures have changed, some for the better and some for the worse. Missions that have you exploring for a secret base while lost in the tundra winds of Hoth or scavenging for pieces of tech while avoding the sands of a worm-infested desert are a nice change of pace.\n\nWhat doesn't work are the racerbike mission, the Rancor "Stealth" mission, and the other side-operations where the gameplay doesn't feel like it was polished enough to be fun. Relying on the allies' AI to act properly is a terrible idea because there's no command system to tell them what to do (like running away while I distract a Rancor), and I think some gameplay changes (the rancerbike jousting mission) have broken controls.\n\nThankfully, the game doesn't require you to play every single level, and you can always back out to choose something else. So instead of a completely polished, excellent campaign we get probably 3/4ths of good ideas, and the rest that are meh at best, which helps to mitigate the tediousness of the lightsaber combat.\n\nSupposedly the Best Lightsaber Combat Ever?\nMaybe I don't understand the lightsaber mechanics, but I fail to see what makes JA's mechanics the best.\n\nIt's exactly the same basic mechanics from Jedi Knight 1 & 2: Hold LMB to attack, RMB to do a special/light-saber throw. However, they added in combo-based moves to the fighting system that feel as demanding as a fighting game.\n\nThe best I can say about this new system is that there is a great sense of fluidity in the animations. Jumping off of walls, doing cartwheel attacks, power-strikes or crouch attacks, and evading a down-ward stab by rolling away go to make the combat feel the most lively. Weapon styles and attack strategies are also added to give you more options in combat.\n\nAll of this, I agree, makes the combat feel so great.\n\nThe drawback to this combo system is that you have to rely memorizing the moves, and when you are trying to use them it can feel too rigid to get down properly. But maybe that's just a skill-barrier I haven't mastered yet; it's not the reason why I find this combat system shallow.\n\nThe reason why I'm not engaged in Jedi battles is that I cannot read my enemies' moves or know, for certain, whether I'll land a blow or not. I've had better luck winning battles if I flail around and hold the attack button then try to land precise strikes, either with one-handed light-sabers or with two of them.\n\nMaybe the combat is balanced for multiplayer only. Towards the end of the campaign where the game litters you with Dark Jedi, I never felt the combat system was refined enough to make me feel like I earned each victory. I preferred cleaving through the hordes of Stormtroppers, Droids or Smugglers because my Force abilities and my arsenal would be more useful. (Seriously, Jedi can reflect rockets?)\n\nWhy Is Jedi Academy OK but Not Great, and Why Is Jedi Knight 2: Outcast Bad?\nFor one, the level design and the lightsaber mechanics are much more refined than Outcast ever hoped to be. Another reason, as mentioned before, the game will vary up your playstyle either by fighting new enemies or making new mission  types that change up your arsenal to not make you grow bored of the lightsaber combat.\n\nThat last part is what Outcast failed to remember when it made lightsabers the most efficent weapon to use to protect yourself and to mow down your enemies. When fighting the giant Dark Stromtroppers with rockets/concusion rifles, it's best to attack them with heavy weaponry from afar than charge in with Protect enabled.\n\nAlso, by giving you the lightsaber from the get-go, you now have the Force abilities from the start to make up for relying on the light-saber so much in Outcast.\n\nThe only thing I don't think Raven Software got right is making a better story. It's so obvious what happens from the first few cutscenes that the "suspsense" is laughable. The canon characters were the only bits that felt as interesting as Outcast.\n\nUnfortunately, the story is not the only disappointing feature of Jedi Academy. For whatever reason, you won't unlock a second saber style until the first round of missions are done, and then you won't unlock a new lightsaber type until you get to the final 4/5 missions. There is no New Game Plus mode to make replaying the game entertaining, not unless you enable cheats which can break the game if Force points aren't allocated properly.\n\nThis is such a majorly missed opportunity where the game could've focused more on how the three combat styles (one-handed, two one-handed, two-sided) relied on different tactics when fighting enemies throughout the campaign. (I've heard some argue it was for balance reasons but I don't see why that couldn't be an option.)\n\nEven then, I still don't think the quality of Jedi Academy, even at its greatest and ignoring its worse aspects, ever reaches the peak of Dark Forces 1/2. (Something I've gone into great detail in my Jedi Knight 2 Steam review.)\n\nThe only reason I'm complaining about the assocation of the games is because I have expectations from the previous games that haven't been reached.\n\nA Bitter End for a Promising New Beginning\nDespite everything I've gone through with Outcast and the worst parts of Jedi Academy, I would still like this series to be given another chance.\n\nI'd love for Raven Software, or another company, to try the Dark Forces/Jedi Knight format (or even make a Jedi Academy sequel forgoing everything) one more time because I think what they achieved here is a step in the right direction.\n\nSomething along the lines of Witcher 1's weapon styles, added into Dark Souls/Risen 1/Spectacle-Fighter gameplay, and given the Star Wars treatment would be a beautiful game to play. And because of the longevity of this title by its fans is still strong I think there is more than enough of an audience who would be willing for another game.","January 21","false","7.9"," 9 of 23 people (39%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","39","9","23","4","0"

Not bad, but still not good.\n\nFor starters, the lightsaber is, for all intents and purposes, the only viable weapon. The guns have a hard time hitting anything, and do very little damage when they do. The lighsaber, on the other hand, will kill most humanoid enemies in a single, well-executed swing and can even be thrown to instakill from a distance. It also does a good job of deflecting bullets, which guns leave you completely vulnerable to.\n\nWhile this may not seem so bad, it gets worse. The lightsaber, while still much better than any of the gun, has its own issues. Instead of simply swinging, your Jedi will try to do all sorts of visually impressive lightsaber maneuvers. This equates to flailing around awkwardly and sometimes even completely missing enemies that are right in front of you.\n\nNow, for the icing on the cake. The vehicles. Vehicles are terrible in most games. Raven Software apparently took this as a personal challenge. While on a vehicle, you can move forward and backward and turn with the mouse. The problem is that moving your mouse left or right will only move the camera a little bit. In other words, you'll have to drag the mouse several times in the same direction to turn. And of course, like any game with bad vehicles, Jedi Academy has levels where operating them is required.\n\nOverall, this game is, like I said, really not THAT bad. Using the lightsaber does provide a decent amount of enjoyment, and it's pretty satisfying to kill people. But I wouldn't pay full price for it, and I'm happy I didn't.","May 12, 2015","false","8.4"," 3 of 23 people (13%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","13","3","23","4","0"

But underneath it all is the idea of a diamond. 1/10 I want my money back and the money for a new metaphorical window.","October 20, 2014","true","1.0"," 0 of 18 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","18","0","0"

This switch to third person view and the more generic "I am a nameless random Jedi" character you play instead of Kyle Katarn makes the game not very compelling to me. I played about 4-5 hours of it (pre-Steam) back in the old days, got bored with it, and forgot about it.\n\nThe upside is that it is, of course, much prettier than the older games. 3rd person view means lightsaber dancing looks cooler.\n\nBut overall, for me it was the most forgetable of all Star Wars games, namely due to my lack of interest in who I was playing (who can be customized up the wazoo, at least for a 90's era game). But Asypr/Lucasart's wish to make the game like an RPG, without the RPG elements, were its downfall. You play and watch Star Wars for the story and for the characters, not (just) the gameplay and the graphics.","February 3, 2015","false","0.2"," 5 of 35 people (14%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","14","5","35","0","0"

However, the game punishes you pretty hard for this toward the end of the game when you have to fight through several Jedi. And if you’re like me and skipped out on your "how to fight with lightsaber class", the lightsaber fights seem to randomly decide whether or not you win or die. It got so bad that I didn't even finish the game because the fights stopped being fun to me.\n\nThe levels are also not that well made. While the game does try to vary it's gameplay by having a different type of objective on each map. The maps themselves are not that memorable had have pretty poor sense of conveyance about them despite, that most of the levels are linearly designed and have one way to reach the goal. Multiple times I got lost because every section looked to similar to each other. Additionally the invisible walls of this game tends to take out some of the platforming fun that could be had as a Jedi.\n\nAt the end of the day I don't think I will be returning to this game. The fun and memorable experiences I had with it, do not outweigh the frustration I've had with it.","May 11, 2014","false","21.3"," 7 of 48 people (15%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","15","7","48","0","0"

I enjoyed it at first but, then this quickly dissolved into a smouldering pool of hatred and frustration. The story is okay, but in terms of Star Wars it's nothing to write home about.  They set it up in the beginning to have some kind of potential but they don't really deliver on it. I know there's a few potential ways for the story to go but after one playthrough I don't really care to explore them. I wouldn't buy this for ten bucks, not even six. This is a purchase I most definitely regret. The gameplay at times is fun and smooth but then it can be clunky, awkward and blood-boiling-break-your-keyboard-in-half annoying.  The variety of force powers is cool and it is the only aspect of the combat that I found enjoyable. However, everything else was just painfully awkward and I tried to avoid the guns and other weapons like the plague during comabt. Overall, I would say you could skip this one. There are plenty of other Star Wars games out there that are much more enjoyable.","November 30, 2013","false","27.0"," 13 of 103 people (13%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","13","13","103","0","4"

The Force Powers are more diverse than in Jedi Outcast, and I prefered the change in Force progression. Not many weapons were added, but as this was released a couple months after Jedi Outcast, I'm not surprised. The lightsaber mechanics, while unchanged for the most part, were enhanced in that they added dual-saber wielding and double-bladed sabers, adding another level to the complexity of the saber combat. The story progression was also changed from cinematic story progression to level selection. But the biggest change is the fact that Kyle Katarn in not the main character of the story. All of these things depend on your view of the series, but all in all the game is very enjoyable, and definetly one of the top three games in the series (though it takes the number three spot). 8.5 out of 10.","May 20, 2014","true","15.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While previous Jedi Knight games centered around Kyle Katarn and the first person shooter action associated with his mercenary ways, Jedi Academy pushes Katarn aside and allows a new character to play the central role - a character completly made up by you! Being able to play as various different species (and genders) as well as the ultimate nerdgasm - your own lightsaber, with customisable hilts, blade colour, and, later in the game, a Darth Maul saberstaff, or alernatively, two sabers (one in each hand) - make this undoubtedly the ultimate Star Wars fan's dream.\nThe gameplay itself is pretty solid, and while the game's visuals are somewhat dated, it still looks convincing enough to hold that used universe feel that Star Wars is reknowned for.\nSaber combat is varied enough, with combos and plenty of flurrys and other special moves to keep you going.\n\nHighly recommended.","April 30, 2012","true","27.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As well as being able to choose the dark side later on eventually.\nThe game has 3 chapters in total where you can complete 5 missions each to unlock a new one to progress further on and eventually get into an epic boss battle.\nThe multiplayer has lots of gamemodes and ones that are seen in many games such as FFA,TDM,CTF as well as having original ones like Power Duel having to face a sith as a jedi with an npc or with a friend and having to defeat that sith together (Like in Episode 3 Obi-Wan and Anakin Vs Dooku)\nSetting out on a journey, being in a jedi academy.\nAs a star wars fan why wouldn't you like this?

Telling you that your computer has low battery, screenshot notifications ect.. leaving it unplayable untill you quit and restart the game. Or sometimes, it will just happen unexpectedly (however this has only happend to me once).\n\nAnd pressing a button while the intro credits are playing will open a sreen with some planets that you can't get out of untill you restart the game.\n\nIf I find any more bugs, I will write them here, but other than that, there is nothing bad I can say about this game. 10 lightsabers out of 10.\n\n\n*EDIT*\n\nSo, whilst playing, I've found that the multiplayer won't open (which is a shame because I bought it mostly for multiplayer). But I was looking through the core folder for the game, and found a fully functional version of the game (don't ask me why there is another copy of the game in there).\n\nSo it has come to me that the problem may be the Steam version of Jedi Academy, but I got to play it in the end, so I still recommend this game.","January 16, 2015","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It might have my favorite capture the flag of any FPS as the combination of lightsabers, conventional weapons, and force powers add layers of strategy to the game that other FPS' lack. Sure, "Team Fortress 2" CTF probably has more depth over all, but I find it less fun to play, personally, as being stuck in one class can get tiring. Jedi Academy CTF flag is like TF2, only every player has all the benefits of every TF2 class, so your role will be determined by the strategy you employ rather than class selection.\n\nOn top of this, while the single player is a bit cheesy and no where as good as the previous Jedi Knight games, Jedi Academy is, hands down, the absolute pinnacle of lightsaber combat in a video game. Basically every Star Wars game ever has tried it, but it's distressing how so many have gotten it completely wrong. The last two Jedi Knight games were the only ones to ever nail it: it's fast, fluid, looks awesome, and has just enough complexity to allow for strategic play, but not so much that it becomes an impairment.\n\nAnyhow, this rec is meant as a bit of a requiem given that Disney just shut down Lucas Arts for good. This, sadly, means that we probably aren't going to see another "Jedi Knight" game again. However, the shuttering of Lucas Arts allowed Raven to finally release the source code for Jedi Knight 2 and Jedi Academy, so hopefully modders will be able to do some awesome stuff with these games in the near future.","April 5, 2013","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I had fabricated memories of this been the best game in the series, and althoug there were good bits, overall it was a little clunky. A lot of the levels were short and literally tiny. I got the impression the devs were going for a sort of RPG choose where you go next feel that didnt quite work out. Instead you end up picking a level from a screen, then finding yourself in something smaller than a multiplayer map running back and forth doing tasks. Every now and then you get a 'proper' level, one big enough that it has to load the next part at some point. These parts of the game were much more enjoyable and reminiscent of the previous game.\n\nAgain, its made difficult to properly enable decapitation. Im sure there were ratings reasons or something, but still, annoying.\n\nOf course the reason I had such good memories of this game was down to the multiplayer.

It is a story driven action game in which you get to be a Jedi apprentice at Luke Skywalker's Academy.\n\nYou can customize your Jedi hero by choosing the gender, race, clothing, and then choose your light saber (hilt and color). Only the Jedi colors (no red) are available in single player, including Mace Windu's purple. The saber can be upgraded later on to staff or dual sabers, which is awesome.\n\nBy doing missions, you get to choose between light and dark force powers, like heal, mind trick, force lightning. These can be upgraded with time, while the "core" powers (jump, push, pull, etc), upgrade automatically with your in game progression.\n\nAfter several missions you become a jedi knight and you can upgrade your sword to Darth Maul's staff, or dual wielding light sabers. Again you get to pick the colors, you can have a blue and green sword if you like. Each saber style has it's own combo moves, the jedi can do lots of acrobatics with the saber which need some time to get used with, but after some practice they add a lot to the combat system.\n\nThe missions are varied, you even get to ride creatures or vehicles. Some missions are quite long and you get to kill lots of imperial troops. However they aren't boring because with time you get to fight more and more sith. The light saber duels are the best part of this game. Sometimes these fights can be quite unpredictable, you can die quite fast or waste two sith warriors at once in a spectacular combo in Matrix style slow motion. You also get to meet several key figures from the Star Wars universe, like Luke, Chewbacca, Kyle Katarn (from previous SW games), and Boba Fet. In the last missions the sith you will meet can be quite challenging, but this only makes the game more interesting. The music is of course the music from Star Wars, it is epic..\n\n10/10","December 30, 2014","true","23.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While previous Jedi Knight games centered around Kyle Katarn and the first person shooter action associated with his mercenary ways, Jedi Academy pushes Katarn aside and allows a new character to play the central role - a character completly made up by you! Being able to play as various different species (and genders) as well as the ultimate nerdgasm - your own lightsaber, with customisable hilts, blade colour, and, later in the game, a Darth Maul saberstaff, or alernatively, two sabers (one in each hand) - make this undoubtedly the ultimate Star Wars fan's dream.\nThe gameplay itself is pretty solid, and while the game's visuals are somewhat dated, it still looks convincing enough to hold that used universe feel that Star Wars is reknowned for.\nSaber combat is varied enough, with combos and plenty of flurrys and other special moves to keep you going.\n\nHighly recommended.","April 30, 2012","true","27.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is the exact same engine and graphic style as JK2. That being said the weapons, controls and combat are almost exactly the same as Jedi Knight 2. As for multiplayer there are 3 types of players - those that love it and play constantly, those that will play it once or twice on rainy boredom filled day, and those who will try it once and see it feels much different from singleplayer and won't play it again.","August 20, 2014","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is the game that I think everyone, even if you're not a fan of Star Wars, should play it. As mentioned in PCGamer, it makes the lightsabers feel like sabers rather than a neon stick with high damage. These lightsabers are rods of superheated plasma, and my god does it let you know that. Stand close enough to a wall, and where your saber would clip through the wall, it cuts it, leaving a burning trail through the wall. If it rains, the water hisses and makes steam. These babies are also one or two hit kills too - you can chop off your enemies limbs with finesse if you're fast enough.\n\nThere is absolutely nothing stopping you from never using a gun (apart from one mission where you are captured), and the sabers themselves also have a vareity of unique moves depending on which saber you can choose. Yes, you can customise your saber. Colour, hilt and type. Want Darth Maul's red saber staff? You can choose red as your colour in MP (or if you want, pick an aggressive shade of orange. The purple is also known for striking fear into the hearts of your enemies). You can also customise your character. In fact, the only solid thing is your name, the helpfully ambigous Jaden Korr. Your race, gender and clothing is up to you. Also the female player is voiced buy Jennifer Hale, otherwise known as female Shepard.\n\nThe multiplayer community is also somewhat active, but remember, if you're a beginner to the saber (even if you've finished the game) there is always that one guy who is just better than you. It can be aggravating, but get some friends, and it's amazing.","December 23, 2013","true","17.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Graphics are I suppose outdated, but but not without its charm - immerserive enough to not be put off by them. Good level design, relatively big, though you can't revisit levels so limiting to a degree. Very Formulaeic game style in which you start in a window with missions to select (select a mission), then you go on the mission and fight enemies - including very fun lightsaber battles - and then you get a well done and repeat with a concluding mission at the end of each chapter. The game has an RPG element to it where you can increase an ability by 1 per mission. It doesn't really add anything to the game, but it does stop you from completing it in a day! (kind of). The best things about this game compared to Outcast is that you can adapt you lightsaber which effects your battle style - you can also have a dual lightsabre - The other thing is the lightsaber fighting mechanics, which if you like realism, and control, mixes the 2 concepts very well. The fighting is fluid and fun. You can jump off walls (in more than one way) kick your enemy Qui-gon style, and also back stab like Obi-wan. You also get into locked lightsabres where you can push you're enemy, and many things it's just all good fun.","December 17, 2013","true","43.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
