Very engaging.  Shockingly long, especially if you try to go it without looking up puzzle solutions.\n\nAs both a pro and a con, it's HARD.  I don't expect that many people will be able to beat it without frequent walkthrough use, which is a shame.  It's hard to say it's outright unfair.  Puzzle solutions are usually near the puzzles.  But some of the puzzles are just brutal, and I'm not convinced yet that all are strictly logical.  Most are.  But a few either are not, or left a hint buried somewhere where I did not find it.  Some puzzles are hidden in places where you're unlikely to realize there even WAS a puzzle.  Unfortunately, most of those are absolutely essential to making progress in ways that are not always obvious.\n\nStill though, this game was a lot of fun.  Debating puzzle fairness and/or logic aside, it was a blast, which is the most important thing!  Truly creative, captivating, and worth it.  Go for it.  Just don't exect it to be easy!","April 17","true","61.0"," 32 of 40 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","32","40","0","9"

I have not ever been into this kind of games, but this one is unique enough to try it out. The graphics (or rather, photography) and the enviroments are amazing, with a gloomy, lonely feel. The puzzles are very well crafted, they have introduced me to code systems that makes Silent Hill 3's puzzle hard mode seem easy in comparison.\n\nI cheated a little at the end asking for help, but trust me that you that it feels extremely rewarding to do it for yourself. Also, one of the best aspects for the game is to do everything at your own pace, because once you advance 2 hours in the game, the map expands a lot, giving access to 4 additional stages and more sectors of the mansion, which you can all explore with little to no barriers...this is a thing that many lineal adventure games should be learning from : allow the player to explore freely.\n\nOh, and it manages to do all that while being PEGI 7","April 17","true","24.7"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","11","18","0","0"

The music, tone and feel of the the game fit perfectly with the environment. It's a true puzzle solving lovers' dream come true. You will have to solve the many clues as to what has happened to 12-year-old Abigail since she died having fallen through the Blackwood Manor window. You will wonder around the Manor as a spirit, or you will engulf items and fly around utilizing them to solve even more clues.

What an elegant game!  Thoughtful (sometimes very difficult) puzzles and set in an intricately drawn world.  It's the best game-playing I've had in a long time.\n\nOn the plus side, the story is tantalizing.  As you find objects, clues, story lines, you just get pulled more and more into the game.  The story does not have much interaction with other characters but that, in a way, is preferable.  It lets you work at your own speed and explore the many facets of the scenes while you piece together the bits of knowledge and things you uncover.  You never know what item may be helpful so you really get a chance to thoroughly inspect the fantastically rendered artwork of the game.\n\nFor me, it had some negatives, too.  It's a dark story in a dark setting.  I'm not a person drawn to death/dying/dark/sad games as I don’t think death should be fodder for entertainment.  No, I’m not a squeaky-clean member of the pep squad who wants all sunshine and rainbows.  It’s just that when I play a game, I want to escape to a better or more interesting place than where I am now.  The game setting is definitely interesting so I did enjoy the playing of the game.  I just kept hoping that there would be some sort of retribution, vindication, or salvation for the character(s) I came to care for.\n\nOverall, I am glad I played the game because it is beautifully rendered and thoughtful game play.  I may have to play something a bit lighter now to perk up my mood but I do recommend it for gamers who like to solve puzzling games and mysteries.\n","May 31","true","14.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There is a lot of reading involved and there are some strange turns of phrase occasionally. This might be due to the developer being French, perhaps it was translated into English. Some scenes contain many visual elements you can get a description of and I have seen instances where the order you view them in might have flowed more smoothly. So far the story is interesting, thought a bit terrifying. There is some question as to what happened to the children of your older sister and I am certain that will be central to the final story.\n\nAt the beginning you are somewhat restricted in which parts of the manor you can visit, but it opens up in the first two hours of play. I like the way additional parts of the manor have to be unlocked.\n\nThe game runs well. I can maintain 1080p at 60fps. The background audio gets a bit monotonous. In the end it is probably better to have the ambient sounds than music, but the game tells you at the beginning that sound is important. So far there has been only a single sound which was important to hear, and your character responds to it in text anyway.\n\nI can recommend the game if you enjoy point-and-click adventures and are not put off my reading a lot of text. For those who prefer full voice acting I suggest you look elsewhere, or watch someone else play it.\n\nI am doing a complete let's play series for this video on my YouTube channel.

Granted, he was mostly just derping around to check out the game rather than dig into the meat of it, but it prompted me to buy it.\n\nI was in love with the art, music, and overall concept before the game even truly started. What an amazing world these lovely developers created!\n\nThat being said, the gameplay is rather straightforward - You play as the ghost of a young woman named 'Abigail'. The setting is around the late 1930's to early 1940's. You spend your time in the game doing puzzles to piece together an understanding of what has happened to young Abigail, and her family. As a ghost, you can 'float' through walls, and posess objects to further your quest.\n\nI will say one last thing before you decide to buy this game - make sure you pay the @#$% attention. Some of these puzzles are not for the feint of heart and require reading and understanding the notes and things that you find in the game. Abigail will also give you clues here and there in her journal, and hints as she 'speaks' to you about an area. Read everything, touch everything - more than once if you have to. One blessing in-game - all areas have their own puzzles. So you're not forced to carry objects from one area to another. One room to another, sure, but not to other areas.\n\nEverything leads back to the Blackwood manor...Will you discover the secrets that it holds?\n10/10 would pull my hair out doing puzzles again.","April 18","true","30.5"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","1","5","0","0"

The discreet soundtrack always fits the job.\n\nBig plus : the general lore and the design of several items are clearly lovecraftian in their inspiration.\n\nThe game's length is more than correct. Even if most of the puzzles may not give you a really hard time (except a few ones, for which a thorough reading of the documents is essential, if not the use of a pen and a sheet of paper), they're elegant and interesting.\n\nThe french texts are written with style, also with some grammatical and orthographic mistakes (which might very slightly break the immersion, given that {minor spoiler alert} our character's family is supposed to be filled with scholars...).\nOh, and last thing : play fair, and don't play unless you're in a dark room, with headphones and sound on...\n\n\nANYWAYS, quite a low price for such a great surprise.

I'm an impatient gamer generally, but found myself more than happy to take my time with this, absorbing the atmosphere, exploring the beautifully drawn settings and solving the many puzzles which ranged from fairly straightforward to  fienndishly tricky. In general, the puzzles are very satisfying to solve, although not always obvious - it often didn't dawn on me until later in the game that things were part of the puzzles - but that's not necessarily a bad thing. It certainly makes you think (and I admit to resorting to the walkthrough towards the end).\n\nI had no problems running the game; no bugs while I used it.\n\nThere is a lot to read, and notes will likely help although most everything you need is stored for you in your journal and in the codex, and there's no voice acting (which might be considered a plus compared with some games) but that fits with the story and feel of the game.\n\nSo - if you like point and click, relish a challenge, and don't mind putting in the effort, this is an absorbing, atmospheric and satisfying way to spend a fair few hours.

I have over 10 hours playing.  At first I wasn't sure if I was going to like the POV because it was a sidescroller and I had just finished playing a 360 degree view game.  But I got used to it quickly and really like how the character floats and zips through rooms and countryside.\n\nThe puzzles are great and none to easy.  At times I found myself quitting the game so I had time to think through the clues and figure out my next steps.  At first, you are limited to a few locations, but after you solve some puzzles more locales open up.  I like that as I become claustrophobic when games have just a few locations to explore.  The character has no inventory but can use items by possessing them.  This works because the items are normally used fairly close to their original location.\n\nThere is a journal that keeps track of clues and a codex that records all the various texts you encounter.  Both are useful to remind you or give the information t to solve a puzzle.  It takes a while (or for me it did), to figure out the family relationship of the various characters that have left notes and clues.  In fact, I think I am still figuring that out because I am hung up on one puzzle that uses that information.\n\nI've run across two problems of a technical nature.  One is resolved and that is related to getting one of my possessed items into a place I couldn't get it out of.  I found some tech help and got that fixed.  The other is that I have some background problems in that the scenes are broken up and I have a black tunnel across the screen.  Frankly, I didn't realize it was a problem as I thought it was an artistic device for certain locations to show I was in a different realm.  So far it hasn't been a problem and it is not at all locations. EDIT:  Background problems resolved.  Had to reload some files and it cleared up the issue.  Yay!\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone that wants to think and work out answers to puzzles.  If you want HOGs or easy linear games, this is not the game for you.  If you want to use reason, logic and think about a game even when you are not playing....this is the game for you.  Go get it!","May 1","true","26.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The puzzles are rather difficult, but in my opinion mostly fair. There were only a few that I felt were too vague or hard to solve, and a few extra that were more tedious than difficult, but they did nothing to hamper what is otherwise a great game - especially if the idea of racking your brain for lengths at a time to solve a puzzle appeals to you.\n\nThe writing in the game was also very captivating and always left me wanting to learn more as I progressed. So even if the difficulty isn't for you, I feel many people would still get a great experience if they used a walkthrough for the tougher puzzles and focused more on the story.\n\nThe game is definitely worth giving a try.","May 14","true","11.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some areas are particularly interesting in design and the sheer size of it is impressive. You’re free to explore the world mostly without being constrained during the mid-game and most importantly it shows a lot of heart. It’s definitely worth a look if you’re a fan of the genre.\n\nFull review here: http://pressa2join.com/reviews/goetia","May 20","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
