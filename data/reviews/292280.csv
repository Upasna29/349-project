Trip Runner and Super Hexagon overlap with fans of puns and a tolerance for kids games, there's a chance you might really enjoy this game.\n\nSpy Fox in Cheese Chase is a spin off game - it's not a point and click adventure like the rest of the Humongous Entertainment mainstays such as Pajama Sam, Freddie Fish, or Putt-Putt. It's actually more akin to a vertical scroller. You are trying to track down Russian Blue who has stolen a priceless cheese - as a result, your goal from level to level is to avoid obstacles, eliminate goons (sometimes with your environment, and sometimes with your "weapons" - bananas, pies, and plungers), follow the cheese trail left behind, and keep gas in your spy-mobile.\n\nIt's incredibly simple in concept and mechanics - there's no deep story or creative application of mechanics here. If you pick it up, it'll be because you want to play a spy fox game again and experience that nostalgia all over again. However, it's quite good at what it does. For the most part, the mechanics and levels are fair - relying on you gradually getting a better hang for the mechanics as the game progresses and not really ever employing fake difficulty.\n\nDespite being a kids game, it's no walk in the park. The game starts out very patient and slow, allowing a new gamer to get their feet wet, but by the end of the game may well be dying several times in any given level and adapting your strategy accordingly.\n\nFair warning - the game had a small team from a while back. There are some buggy behaviors were collision areas aren't perfectly defined, or slipping on an object one time has a different result the next time and when these things occasionally happen, if you can't recover, they will feel like the game messed up. Additionally, the game is not going to run at 60 fps no matter what your rig is - the animations for the game are very very noticeable and occasionally disorienting, bordering on causing eye strain depending on the circumstances. I was able to deal with it and still heavily enjoy the game, but this could be a deal breaker for some people, and I don't want to mislead you.\n\nLastly, the game comes with fairly advanced level making functionality. I don't think this will be a major draw for anyone, but considering it comprised of three of the six main menu options, I thought it was worth mentioning.\n\nTLDR: Spy Fox in Cheese Chase is a not-♥♥♥♥ blast of nostalgia that holds up for entertainment value and challenge to a modern day playthough. For the right person, it's definitely worth $5.","September 26, 2014","true","6.0"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","12","12","0","0"

Waaaay back.\n\nHonestly though, I think that even without the nostalgia factor, I enjoy this game for what it is. A simple linear pick-em-up with interesting levels, charming scenery (that you can run over), and an actual difficulty scale that isn't tame nor vicious.\n\nI highly recommend this to anyone who remembers it as a kid, and moreso the kids of today...","March 31, 2015","true","1.3"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","8","8","2","0"

But first let's go over something.\n\nWhy the ♥♥♥♥ do I care so much about The Prized Limburger Cheese.\n\nAnyway this is a nice game.\nWHY?\nWell just calm down mate I was gonna get to that in a second!\nFor one thing the Villian is a familiar face; Russian Blue. You know the cat from the first game who loves Ze Tango.\nAlso its everything you'd want from a game like it.\nEnemies, point system, obstacles you name it.\nThe point of the game is too catch Russian Blue because she stole some cheese which is a federal crime I guess.\nSuch valuable work we do here at Spy Corps. Catching Cheese Thiefs. Wait What's that. A Sereal Killer on the loose. Mate if we go after that what will happen to the Cheese. Who cares about the lives of several innocents. Just ♥♥♥♥ off mate.\nSo as I was saying we must get back the Cheese. And to do so we have to fight bad guys, dodge obstacles, and collect gas.\nBy the way in this game gas is free and just happens to be lying on the road. If only it was like that in real life.\nIf you were wondering what the "bad guys" were well then here you are. Their pigs. Pigs are despicable things by the way. But these pigs oh these pigs they want me dead. The pig in Dry Cereal was just a cheating ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at Go Fish.\nSmall price to pay to get rid of Go Fish I guess.\nThe obstacles are very varied (<Redundant Reduncy) . Just play the game if you really need to know what they are.\nAlso there is some cheese you dont want. It's the green cheese with fumes. But why is that bad. I'm actually quite fond of moldy rotten cheese. No not really. Here's the problem with this ♥♥♥♥ing cheese. Its placed in the most annoying places. Like if you surround normal cheese on all sides with stinky cheese how the hell do you expect me to get the cheese without touching the green cheese. Did Satan himself design this level!\nAnyway.\nThis game is good.\nBuy it.\nIt's fun.\nThere are 100 levels getting progressibly harder.\nI guess It'd be stupid if they got progressivly easier.","February 5","true","0.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Upon her heist she encounters Spy Fox & Quack who try to apprehend her only to end up from a highspeed to worldwide chase. Spy Fox does the ground manuvering while Quack provides him with supplies, weapons, and fuel for his vehicles. The game is a basic overview racing game where you need to dodge various obstacles and collect items to aid your trek. As you progress the game it gets harder with more obstacles and various henchmen and other hazards to either fight or avoid at all costs. This spin-off to Spy Fox is on par with the Pajama Sam's Lost & Found game. So in other words, it provides you with something to play to kill some time. Since it's a Spy Fox related game, it's worth checking out.","August 27, 2015","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
