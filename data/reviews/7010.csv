The structure of the game is that of your usual single-player fps campaign (beating a linear series of levels), but it does some interesting things that make it worth playing.\n\nThe combat in this game is excellent. Each weapon is interesting and fun to use, but more importantly each weapon is useful for different types situations, meaning you'll be switching which one you use frequently. Furthermore, they all retain their usefullness throughout the campaign, meaning you won't be lugging around a bunch of useless weapons by the time the endgame rolls around. Each weapon also has an alt-fire, which expands their possibilities even more.\n\nThis game started off as a spin-off of Deus Ex, and even though the final product no longer shares that title or universe (and doesn't have any rpg elements, being a pure FPS), it does let you use the same of type nano-augmentations to give you the upper hand in combat. This ranges from making your self invisible, to shooting electric bolts, to becoming completely invulnerable. These augmentations let you try a variety of different strategies for approaching each battle and did a great job of spicing up the game (although I did find myself using the invulerability one pretty much exclusively it was made available). Also like Deus Ex, there is also a hacking element. You have a device called the "icepick" that lets you fire a dart onto anything that's hackable and then take control of that thing remotely. This allows you to take control of turrets and mechs, and using them to turn the tables on the enemies is hilarious and awesome.\n\nThe last thing in terms of gameplay I want to bring up is that the level design is excellent. Even though the levels are mostly linear, each area gives you a handful of options and alternate routes, meaning you could go in guns blazing, or you could try to find a sneakier path and do things stealthily. Overall, the gameplay is Project: Snowblind's strongest point, as the weapon design, level design, and augmentations blend together brilliantly.\n\nDespite the excellent gameplay, there are a handful of areas Project: Snowblind falls short in, some of which were detrimental to my enjoyment of the game, some not so much. The biggest issue I had with this game is that the saves are handled using manual checkpoints you must find and activate within the level, as opposed to being able to save where you want or using automatic checkpoints. Normally, I don't mind checkpoints too much, but Project: Snowblind only has one or two of these points per level, meaning that if you die, you usually have to replay much more of what you just did than is desirable (usually about 7 or 8 minutes worth). What's even worse is these checkpoints are sometimes hidden in obscure, out of the way places and in some levels I couldn't even find them despite the game having a feature telling you what direction you should be heading to find them. These checkpoints really drag down the game, and whenever I found myself quitting the game, it was usually because I was tired of having to replay massive swaths just to retry one point.\n\nOn the technical side, Snowblind has a few glaring issues as well. I had the game crash on me several times during my playthrough. This was especially annoying because they usually happened once I finally overcame whatever section of the game I was stuck on (meaning I would have to replay that part yet again once I restarted the game). Annother annoying bug is that there is something wrong with the game's contrast, making everything look extremely washed out making stuff that's supposed to be black more of a gray. This seems to effect everyone's copy and I haven't found any kind of workaround or fix. Take a loot at the user posted screenshots on this game's Steam community hub, then compare them to the screenshots on the Store page, and you will see that something is very wrong. This is extremely annoying and even makes the game hard to look at in places, which is unfortunate, because you can tell the game has decent art direction and isn't supposed to look like this (videos I watched of the PS2 and Xbox versions seemed to be fine however). With that said, I was able to look past this and enjoy the gameplay (which again, is excellent), but this is something you should know about going in.\n\nThe storyline is a weak point as well, but it does have some merit. The overall plot is completely forgettable, basically serving as an excuse for you to shoot your way through each level (as an aside, nearly every cutscene contains a helicopter either destroying something or getting destroyed. This is not a problem). The most interesting thing about the storyline is that the big evil plot that you try to prevent is almost identical to one of the ending options from Deus Ex 1, but that's about it. With that said, the character themselves were actually pretty likeable and distinct, and there is some pretty good voice acting as well (the game also has a surprisingly decent sense of humor that pops up now and them). You won't care why you're fighting this war, but you will enjoy the company.\n\nOverall, Project: Snowblind is pretty solid for a budget game, thanks to fantastic gameplay (even if it doesn't have much else going for it). I don't think I'll be playing through it a second time, but for $1.50, the ride was a fun one worth taking.","July 7, 2014","true","8.1"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","23","25","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/recommended/7010/","jocosity","Communist "Joseph Ballin" Layton","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/","920 products in account","Project: Snowblind was initially a Deus Ex game, before later being turned into a new IP after the poor performance of Invisible War, and it doesn't do a very good job of hiding the fact. You play as a soldier who was forced to become nano-augmented after suffering heavy trauma in a battle, and fight for a peace-keeping group called UNAT- no, wait, I mean the "Liberty Coalition". There's a character who acts as your commander who is mechanically augmented, and frequently laments that he's become outdated. The items all look like they were taken straight from Deus Ex, like the energy cells and health kits, and you fight a lot of familiar enemies like bipedal mechs and mechanical spiders. Even the hacking tool is named after the ICEbreaker hacking interface from Deus Ex.\n\nHowever, it's probably for the best that it never ended up being released as a Deus Ex game. In many ways, this game is sort of like the Bioshock Infinite of Deus Ex, right down to replacing the actual hacking of the real games with a gun that you shoot at panels to instantly hack them. Rather than being an RPG with shooter elements, Project Snowblind is a full FPS. There are no wide open maps or choices to make, just enemies to shoot and objectives to move towards. The game does a loose job of allowing both shooting and stealth playthroughs, but the stealth half is pretty horribly done and not all that viable. The radio contact in the game is also somewhat schizophrenic about this; in one particular mission where you have to get up a few levels of a parking garage, he initially contacts you to tell you that it might be a good idea to sneak through it due to high guard activity, then almost immediately tells you that you might be able to cause some real chaos with one of the vehicles in the next room, only to go back to telling you that stealth might allow you to listen in on guards' conversations on the next floor. You get a handful of augmentations throughout the game, but instead of being able to choose which ones you get or being able to upgrade them, the game just hands them out as you progress, using the same story justification as the reason they later used in Human Revolution. The game doesn't feature very many characters, and while the few it does feature aren't bad, they're barely used, and after you first meet them they tend to disappear until they're needed for a dramatic moment. The story in general is pretty poorly paced, and you fight the final boss of the game about 3/4 into the game. The game is also pretty short, only lasting around 6 hours. The game also has a tendency to crash, particularly when you minimize it, which is a problem since due to being a console game, you can only save in designated save rooms rather than having a quicksave or even checkpoint system.\n\nOn the other hand, as long as you can see it as its own game instead of a Deus Ex main game, it's a pretty fun shooter. It's interesting to see it as a spinoff where you play as just a semi-regular member of not-UNATCO instead of "that guy who single-handedly unravels an Illuminati conspiracy", and while the stealth is generally awful, the shooting is done pretty well, and the weapons and their secondary functions are all pretty fun to use. While it does have a lot of faults if you compare it to Deus Ex itself, as a standalone game it's pretty fun, and it's only $6 at its base price and presumably much less on sale. It's interesting to try out, if only to see the lost Deus Ex game that almost existed. If you do decide to buy it, be sure to check out the widescreen patch on pcgamingwiki if you have a widescreen monitor.","August 27, 2015","true","6.1"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","17","19","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/StephenStrange/recommended/7010/","StephenStrange","Dr. Strange","http://steamcommunity.com/id/StephenStrange/","677 products in account","My review of this game is easy.\n\nIf you like cleaner FPS games like Red Faction, Star Wars Commandos, or even original F.E.A.R., then you should love Snowblind.  It has all the things I love about those games.  Here are just some of them:\n\n1) All environments are "real".  By that I mean that they are all rendered in the 3D world.  Anything you see, you can probably jump or stand on.  No invisible walls except in the sense that the levels have to be defined by something. They aren't infinite after all.  But it is usually something believable like a wall or fence.\n\n2) Along with the above, and the addition of many game elements like alarms, being able to hack terminals and so on, you have many options for how you want to defeat your enemies.  This ranges from a full on berserk attack to stealthily creeping around or hiding.  Lots of air ducts to crawl through.\n\n3) Plenty (and I do mean plenty) of weapons, additional equipment you can use and augmentations to you personally.  Some of these are\n\n-Increased vision abilities\n-Spiderbots that follow you around, like the insects in Half Life, and help you out.\n-EMP, poison gas, and frag grenades\n-Cool shotgun, Carbine, Sniper rifle, and pistol\n-Reflex augmentation that functions like the reflex boost in F.E.A.R.\n-...the list goes on.  This is only a very small part.\n\n4) Lots of environmental elements like steam, lighting, being able to break windows, opening cabinets and breaking some crates for items.  There also is a weapon similar to the gravity gun in Half Life that lets you move some things around and you can pick up certain objects.\n\n5) Fitting AI and com chatter voices, for this kind of game.  So, that means coming across humorous conversations as you sneak around and a CO that is pushing you ahead.  I really appreciate all the background talking that is going on in this game.\n\nThere are lots of other elements that I like too.  But, if any of this interests you, than I would just go get this game.  I bought it for not much from BundleStars since it had been on my Amazon wishlist for some time.  But, now that I know how good it is, I would pay the full $6 price for sure.\n\nOne final caveat:  There are some graphical issues with this game.  Mostly that it looks kind of washed out and low contrast on modern systems.  BUT, I easily took care of it with a little trial and error in the Nvidia control panel.  But, even without that, it seems like the biggest thing that helped was turning off "Fullscreen effects" in the games own options.  You have to run its separate option utility to access it.  Its not hard to get to.  It just pops up when you go to play the game.\n\nWhile trying to troubleshoot this issue, I ran across a lot of hate for this game.  It is completely undeserved.  Its an awesome game, if you like these kinds of games.  Its NOT a COD clone or FarCry or Splinter Cell.  But it is interesting and a lot of fun.

It was released back in 2005, and this is the first time I've played it and thought it was pretty fun. Don't expect a masterpiece or hours upon hours of gameplay, but if you like a short single-player focused sci-fi shooter with a cool setting, then give it a try.\n\nThe setting is a near future and really reminded me of Deus Ex (from what I've heard, it was initially planned to be a sequel to Deus Ex, but later turned into a standalone title). You play as military commander who gets injured in battle and implanted with combat augmentations, which become available for use over time.\n\nThis is what I really enjoyed about the gameplay. It's not just your bog standard corridor shooter relying on twitch reflexes. It has a bit of a strategic edge, as you acquire a number of interesting augmentations throughout the game, such as the ability to slow time, ballistic shielding (temporary protection from bullets), cloak, enhanced vision, and so on. In addition to augmentations, you also find some cool gadgets to use in battle too, such as spider bots to act as your little pets and aid you in combat, deployable force field to act as cover, a large variety of grenades (most of the ones from Deus Ex), and even a nanoboost, which is like your emergency revive that you can choose to use if you die in battle.\n\nThe game seems to have only one difficulty mode (I didn't see how to change it), but overall it's paced really well. I didn't come across any difficulty spikes and the game never throws anything unfair towards you. In some levels it's just you infiltrating some facility, in others the combat takes on a large scale assault and you have many of your squadmates with you and witness battles between large groups of soldiers. It's all really well done, even if graphically the game aged a fair bit.\n\nI only have one big gripe. The game crashes from time to time for no reason. It only happened about 5-6 times for me during my playthrough, but because you aren't able to save anytime you like, at times you could lose chunks of progress. Saving can only be done in special save rooms and also at the end of each level.\n\nOverall it was a fun game. Aside from the crashes, I thought it was well done and would certainly recommend it if you like FPS games with a story and a bit of a tactical edge.","October 31, 2015","true","6.6"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","4"

Of course if you have access to an Xbox or PS2 with composite or some modded HDMI support, that's the best way you've got going for you to play this, in fact, stay far away from this console port if you've got those options.

You get a variety of sick of weapons, some of course your typical FPS weapons like a carbine rifle, pistol, shotgun, rocket launcher, but others are pretty different like a EMP Rifle, Mine gun, a Rail laser, and more.\nAnother thing I like a lot in this game is the augmentations and the ability to hack machinery.\nLike you can hack security panels and do stuff like overide AI of turrets and cameras, hack into combat bots and take control of them, that's something I really liked a lot, don't see it much in FPS.\nYou can also drive cars and mechs but eh the controls for them feel weird. There's only 1 point in the game which is like the third before the last level where driving a car is a life saver than walking.\n\nAugmentations consist of the ability to see trough walls, slow time, shielding, a cloak, and shoot out lighting, but generally I mainly used the shielding because this game uses save points and dying can be sucky at times. But you can revive yourself with the Nano Boosts so that's good.\nStory is lol, I only pay attention to gameplay and music.\n\nAlso another thing is the game tends to crash at times, so if you see a save point, i'd advise saving so you don't lose a lot of progress, but it didn't crash much on me. Only like the beginning levels.\n\nAll in all: I'd say 7/10\nIt's a good game, but not as good as a game like F.E.A.R. and some others FPS.\nPerhaps an HD Remake/Remaster could do this game justice.","April 30","true","4.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The game features a checkpoint save system, which at times can present a challenge for the novice player but seem to be spaced an adequate distance apart.  The game only supports resolutions up to 1600 x 1200, but the Steam Overlay does work.  In the end Project: Snowblind is an above average shooter from it's era. even though it definitely shows its age.","March 24, 2012","true","0.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Gameplay and Story get a rating scale from 1 to 10, and the AV stuff gets a rating from 1 to 5. My philosophy on this is that there are some instances in which a game may not necessarily have that much in the way of gameplay (take Amnesia for example), but the story/atmosphere/whatever it may be is reason enough to pick it up. Also, take the cumulative score with a grain of salt; it's just a numerical feeling about the game as a whole. That's part of why I do these subscores. Also, keep in mind that I'm not going off of school grade based rankings. A 5/10 denotes what I feel to be an average game. Likewise, 7/10 is a game that I think is pretty cool, and something that gets a 2/10 is near-abomination level. Pinning scores to an even further obfuscated rating scale is kinda senseless, but for the sake of my backloggery, I'll repeat again that 1.0-2.7 is a one-star game, 3.0-4.7 is a two-star game, 5.0-6.7, 7.0-8.7, and 9.0-10 are three, four, and five stars, respectively.\n\nGameplay: Project Snowblind, as you may or may not know, was originally intended to be a more multi-player focused game in the Deus Ex series to be called Deus Ex: Clan Wars. Then Invisible War came along and utterly tarnished the Deus Ex name.  Despite the abandonment of the namesake, the game still retains a lot of the level design sensibilities that Deus Ex had, albeit a lot more straightforward here than in Deus Ex. By that, I mean that the player has plenty of choices on how to take areas. You can run in, guns ablaze; pick enemies off from a distance with the sniper rifle; sneak through the area entirely; hack any nearby electronics to kill enemies remotely, etc. etc. Since I often opt for the most meat-headed approach to gameplay, I was a guns blazing kind of player, although there were a few chapters where I found that it wasn't the best approach.\n\nAs I said earlier, this game is pretty much Deus Ex Lite. It has pretty much everything Deus Ex had, although much simpler to suit the very action oriented gameplay. All the RPG elements are gone, which can be disappointing for some. Hacking is done with an Icepick; a weird sort of EMP hacking kajigger. This does mean that you are limited to how many things you can hack throughout the level, although I found that ammo for the Icepick was easy to come by, presuming you looked around for it. Augmentations are here as well, with a few abilities being cloaking, slow motion, and bullet shields. They don't last forever and do use up Bioenergy, which you can find both replenishing items and increases to your maximum Bioenergy (the same for health, of course).\n\nUnfortunately, this game is very much a port. Autoaim is on by default, and I found no way of disabling it. Some people talked about the game crashing all the time; it crashed a couple of times for me, and both times it was just after a cutscene started. After looking at what happened in the Event Viewer, I wasn't able to make certain what it was specifically in Snowblind.SP that crashed or why it did so. This could have also been because of a thing I did to make the game run at 1080p (I'll talk about that later). I did rebind a couple of keys; namely rebinding augmentation usage to Tab and getting rid of the weapon menu altogether. It's just more fun frantically scrolling through weapons in the heat of battle (to me, at least).\n\nThe levels themselves are short, usually lasting about ten to fifteen minutes, and have at least one savepoint in the area. This game doesn't have checkpoints, so be sure to make use of the savepoints. These levels are pretty well paced and often feel reasonable and fair without being completely boring. Enemy variety isn't the greatest, and I would have liked to have seen a few more mech enemies, but it's not too big of a deal. Overall, if you're looking for a dumb mid-2000's shooter to play for a night, you really can't go wrong with this one. For the price of $6 (I picked it up on sale, so it was even cheaper), I can say that this is a very worthwhile purchase, even if you do have to do a few things to get it in reasonable working order. 8/10.\n\nStory: Again, it's pretty much Deus Ex Lite. The game did open with some actually quite good exposition of the main character, Nathan Frost. Unfortunately, it does kinda turn to the same old military hoo-rah schtick after a while. There really isn't much in the way of character development for Frost, much less for anyone else. At least it's not Russia being the bad guys, so I guess there's that. However, at least it's pretty well directed, even if the source material isn't the greatest. The cinematics are pretty well done, even if they do have some questionable choices in filters from time to time. They do start to feel like more of an action movie than a Deus Ex intrigue, however, so take that as you will. However, for what was there, it was pretty enjoyable, if rather cliche at times. 7/10.\n\nGraphics: You're gonna need to do a bit of work in order to get this game running decently on a modern computer. For starters, this game only runs in 4:3 using the default resolutions in-game. I looked a bit on the Steam forums for this game, and I came across a fix that had me download an over-riding DX9 .dll file and its associated .cfg. In that .cfg, it's rather easy to set the resolution to that of your monitors. Some people have said that the fix doesn't work for them, but it worked well for me. Perhaps they didn't put the .dll and .cfg file in the root directory of the game; I dunno. Nevertheless, if you do a little searching on the P:S forums for a topic on widescreen resolution, you'll find what I'm talking about. I will be keeping that file around; it seems to be a pretty neat little multi-purpose DX9 "modernizer". Just don't be dumb and drop it in System32.\n\nAs for how the game looks in the perspective of art style, this is what I talk about when I bring up realistic graphics not standing the test of time. It doesn't look god-awful, but it isn't the easiest thing to look at. Probably the best looking area in the game is the last level, which goes for a very Tron-esque look. Again, the game as a whole doesn't look terrible today, but this is yet another reason why art style should always trump realism when it comes to visual direction. 2/5.\n\nSound: The soundtrack is pretty much a generic action movie soundtrack. It's not bad and it does pump you up, but it's still not that musically interesting. Voice acting is alright; it's certainly not going to be winning any awards, but it's probably not going to put you off, either. I'm running out of space, so I'll just say it's alright. 3/5.\n\nOverall scores are: 8/7/2/3; cumulative score of 6.7/10.","July 3, 2014","true","4.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

No, that’s not about Project Snowblind. I remember playing it 10 years back, just after release, and even then it was not so pleasant experience, with all that console-style shooting mechanics. Replaying it now, I see that the best part of this game is its plot line, which was called “generic” even by backers of this “Project”. So, in short, that’s not a title you really need in your collection, unless you have some personal history with it.\n\nThe story in this game telling you about soldier who got under missile fire, and recovered in hospital, with half of his body replaced with implants. After some petty missions he found himself behind enemy lines, with a few support, against some evil plan to bend over the world. If you think it sounds like Deus Ex, be sure it does: that game was supposed to continue named franchise, adding multiplayer experience, but all of sudden, was released as standalone title. If you consider that Project Snowblind was just as bad as Deus Ex Invisible War, you agree that that was a smart move from Eidos.\n\nFor a count of pluses of this game I can say, it gives you opportunities not to simple shoot in people, but also cloaking from them with one of augmentations, see through walls with another, hacking computers and turrets… And lurking in the air ducts, of course! Everybody loves air ducts.\n\nAlso it is quite short – you can finish it in less than 10 hours. Yeah, it is a plus for a game like this.\n\nFor contras I need to say, that the major part of the game, its essence, a gameplay process – is quite dumb and boring. For real, in the year 2005 we had Far Cry 1 and F.E.A.R., which gives you much better FPS experience. Even if we remember that Project Snowblind is a multi-platform, nesting on XBx, PS2 and only then on PC… There are still a great Psi Ops: the Mindgate Conspiracy game, which was also from PS2.\n\nMultiplayer in that game wasn't really entertaining from the day 1, and it is obvious nobody will be playing it for MP now.\n\nFinally, the reason why I decided to put the dust off from this generic shooter was a hashtag “cyberpunk”. Sadly, but the dose of cyberpunk theme in the Project Snowblind is much lesser than in real world around us. So it’s not cyberpunk. Even with all those augmented superpowers that game gives you. A first Robocop movie has tons of cyberpunk of better quality, than Project Snowblind.\n\nSummarize:\n\nObsolete title deserving only a small R.I.P. commemorative plaque, with mark like 5.5-6/10, and not your actual time. All the better stuff you could possibly find in this game was moved into Deus Ex: Human Revolution. See it for much better experience.","August 14, 2015","false","15.8"," 16 of 33 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","16","33","0","2"

It often tries to play itself up as a hybrid of run-and-gun but hey you could totall stealth and kind of hack stuff (with your auto-hack gun thing) but the only really viable route is the former and it's awful at that too. There's maybe one level where you can kind of sneak, for a little while at least because there's lots of knee high walls to crouch behind but you don't have any silenced weapons and the guard patrols aren't designed to allow for that type of gameplay. You aggro one, you've aggro'd every enemy on that floor or building. I managed to hack a giant robot once which was fun but I could only do that because it was powered down, I never saw another one like that after.\n\nYou just end up playing this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ hybrid of taking cover until you get bored, run forward and mow everyone down hoping there's a health pick-up through the next door.

Im sure google has a viable answer. Anyways, this games pretty sweet.\n\nNow, just because they changed the title, maybe reworked some things, probably scrapped thing that were long worked on, probably rushed to add changes to game so it wasnt a complete scrap.\n\nThis game plays as IF Deus Ex was a story centered 90% linear shooter, where auto-level is on. It has the body enhancement mods, it has the dystopian atmosphere, the glowy tech stuff, Hell, even the sniper rifle looks suspiciously close to the invsiable war sniper rifle. The levels are pretty linear with usually two approaches to things. Go in hard and tell your enemies to bite the pillow, Or take a more subtle stealthier approach. I dont favor the stealth too much because I feel like the npcs ability to detect me is a bit unatural in the earlier levels especially. once you get the cloak its a bit easier, an even fun to use for sneaking or ambushing,  you can use it while in line of sight, which a lot of games that have cloak or invisablity usually dont let you use it in combat. So you can activate it, weave through a troup of soilders and literally reappear behind them and just one hand death punch them one by one. Which brings me to the mods in general, I mention its like deus ex with auto level because the game slowly unlocks more mods as you progress. There is NO choice in how your character grows. luckily they do it at a great pace so your consistently getting new toys to use. the levels usually following your new found mod are kinda built around it so that it would work well with the enviroment. its your choice though, you can always play loud or be quiet. well after the intial few levels. I dont remember what difficulty I selected but its kinda easy. I know its either normal or hard, or what the equivalent may be. they give you plenty of ammo most times, as long as your not wasteful and stupid, like dont shoot to break ammo boxes, just punch it or pick it up an throw it. your biometer for mods never really runs out unless your stupid. theres a few nooks and crannies in every level to search to feed your explorative hunger, usually with rewards for doing so. you find bio an health upgrades this way usually, every few levels it seems for me. Anyways, Like, I said, just imagine deus ex as a linear sorta explorative story driven shooter where the voice acting is actually pretty good for being like what? 12 year old game?  Id say buy it for cereal, sale or not. you got two hours to make a refund if you hate it anyways.","April 8","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
