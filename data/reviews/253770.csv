This game is as shown $9.99 & if you buy this game & not like it well it is not the end of the world as it is a reasonably good buget priced game.\n\nThere are though the odd couple of bugs & glitches that may force you to restart the game, but they are quite rare & you will often play the game without experiencing any stuff ups.","December 10, 2013","true","48.1"," 51 of 68 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","51","68","0","1"

WHY?\n\n...WHYYYY??!?!\n\nWhat is WRONG with the transit system in Germany?? You got cars cutting you off, pedestrians walking back and forth IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CROSSWALK, and cars jumping one another...IT'S PANDAMONIUM!!\n\nDon't believe the videos you see about playing this game. It has bugs up the whazoo, and I seem to be the ONLY PERSON ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH that this happens to. The biggest one so far is that people who get on the bus just...stop. Right at the entrance. You know the spot. The one where the bus driver won't drive because it's a danger zone? And you think it's because maybe the bus is full. Well, la dee da, I look at the rearview mirror...I CAN COUNT ON ALL MY HANDS THE NUMBER OF EMPTY SEATS!!!\n\nARHRHRJRHRJGRHJERGHRJGR MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE!! If they stand in the way, people can't get on the bus, which means I get docked, which means I can't GO ANYWHERE!\n\nSure, alright, I suppose the terrain looks nice and it's kinda nice to hear a german lady voice saying the next stop, but that is COMPLETELY OVERSHADOWED BY THE PROBLEMS IN THIS GAME!\n\nAlright, so maybe Expert is too hard. Fine. So I go beginner. I DIDN'T THINK IT MEANT EVERYONE IN THE GAME WAS AN IDIOT! Like I mean, for serious, traffic is gridlocked...GRIDLOCKED...because the bus driver in front doesn't know the difference between a stationary car in traffic AND A PARKED CAR! And there's nothing in the game to fix itself. I actually put my bus in park, locked the cash register, stepped out of my vehicle, and went on a sight seeing trip. For like 5 blocks...both ways. It wasn't until I came back that I noticed this...convention of vehicles, and all because of this one idiot driver. ARE YOU FREAKIN' KIDDING ME?!\n\nStay away. Stay all the hell away. There are better things to spend your time and money on, especially on Steam. The developers need to seriously fix this...like NOW!\n\nI'm enraged because I was passionate about this. I managed to finish ONE scheduled route, and I had a blast. The fifteen I did after? Trainwreck- sorry, Buswreck.\n\nSeriously guys. Playtest, beta test, alpha test, hell, even test the ai and framework before you put this out there. Some of us actually like the idea of a bus simulator.","December 9, 2013","false","13.9"," 45 of 67 people (67%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","67","45","67","28","5"

It is the most impressive, hardest and coolest simulator ever created.\n\nThe graphics are not amazing, but graphics do not make a game.\nThe sound is all decent and spot on with no complaints.\nThe controls are the trickiest to get used too... Then again you are playing a simulator.  It sometimes has multiple keys to press just to do something, like disabling the break is like a 3 key press system, but I liked it.\n\nI only played a very small amount of time because I just wanted to test and see what it was like, and even though it seems boring, if you love a proper simulator where it is over complicated, writing down your ID and PW to log into bus, sorting the money, doing the air conditioning, closing doors and windows, all while driving then this game will have you impressed.\n\nI am impressed that EVERYTHING on the bus can be controlled and turned and used, and well done to the game.\n\nIt is on sale which is a massive steal for this game and well done to the Devs for making it.\n\nGreat game, great fun for simulation fans.","April 27, 2014","true","0.4"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","6"

When I first started the game I walked to the garage as normal. I opened the door and went in. I saw a place where I could change the bus type (warning: there is only one bus type in the game.) I switched to articulated only to have the game crash, so I just stayed with regular. Once I got in the bus I was given instructions to get the bus started. I followed those instructions and got going. Now, once I was on the road I made a right turn, but since I was in beginner mode, I turned too far and crashed into a tree. Getting back on the road wasn't a problem, except for warnings coming up every 1 second saying to lower the engine rpm rate. Back on the road I continued driving. Later, I crashed into a car, so I went around it. But later after that I crash again, this time so hard I get myself wedged. So I had to reset the bus back at the garage (apparently there is actually an option to do that.) On attempt 2 at getting to the route start I notice that the realistic AI was just a lie, because I had several vehicles crash into me and a bunch of pedestrians didn't even know that my bus was coming, so they walked right into my vehicles path. Later then I turn too much again and crash so, again, I get wedged. At this point I switched to expert mode, since I wanted esier steering. Other than having to wait about another 5 minutes for air pressure to build up and 500 warnings saying it was too warm in the passenger conpartment, it was better overall, at least bus wise. Back on the road I had a much better time steering until I got wedged again. About 8 tries later I finally get to the first bus stop. Passengers get on the bus like normal (except for the fact that they also got in the rear door) and I drove on. At the next stop I had to give change. I had no idea what button to push for that passenger so I guessed. Since there is was no tutorial on giving change (even in beginner) I had to find a youtube tutorial. Once I figured out how to give chang I did it with ease, until the passenger didn't take the change. About a minute later I finally got the passenger to move, but then it said I didn't do it correctly, though I did. I go on to more stops, but at one of them, a passenger was just standing in the middle of the enterance. I had no choice but to start AGAIN. More tries later I actually finish my first route, but again, one of the passengers refused to get off. At this point I just didn't care anymore and accepted that, and just drove away.\nI HOPE I CONVINCED YOU NOT TO BUY THIS "GAME".","March 11, 2014","false","7.1"," 16 of 26 people (62%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","62","16","26","3","3"

That is exactly what Bus Simulator 2012 is not like.\n\nYou are initially offered a choice between two settings, "Beginner" or "Expert". Beginner mode is essentially expert mode with more prompts and sunny weather. Even on the beginner setting there is a steep learning curve, I ended up watching tutorials online and consulting the manual due to the inadequacy of the limited in-game prompts and lack of help features.\n\nOn the plus side the simulation is incredibly in-depth. Every single button on the bus is functional, including for example, all the switches for the blinds, windows, roof hatches, door locks and suite of climate controls. You also have the capability to fine-tune many aspects of the bus including brake and steering behavior, such as the brake speed and delay.\n\nThe environment and its dynamic effects also add to the sense of realism. For example, if you have the heating on when it's raining outside the windows can fog up; this can be remedied by turning the air circulator to the defrost position. What's even more realistic is everyone whinges about the rain as they get on.\n\nOn the downside, there are only 2 bus models (articulated and standard) to choose from which I found to be a bit of a let down. Perhaps a better game title would be "Very-specialised-urban-area-of-Germany-Two-Buses-Simulator 2012".\n\nThe game-world is expansive and has a great level of detail. I really felt like a bus driver in Germany which was mildly depressing. The only thing which detracts from this sense of immersion is the handful of minor AI bugs, but they are rare. Occasionally when turning a tight corner a car will ram into you from behind which is annoying. On the other hand, it's quite amusing to see an overturned AI bus  - it makes you feel a bit better about your driving abilities.\n\nOverall graphics are average to decent but require abnormally high specs. It seems far too taxing but it's still playable on lower settings. The current price of $9.99 seems about right considering the simulation is very in-depth but the game feels unfinished in some areas.\n\nIf you think you will find no enjoyment in driving a simulated bus for an hour then obviously don't buy it, otherwise give it a shot.\n\nOverall: 6.5/10","February 8, 2014","true","15.7"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","7","13","0","0"

Well it's not. Its the exact opposite. This is an actual SIMULATOR. Just getting the bus started was a chore in its self. You will even need to memorize an empolyee number and security code to turn the bus on but once you do. It gets a little easier. Keeping up with the transit schedule and giving exact change to your riders can be a bit tricky. Other than that, It is a solid well built simulator. Not my type of game though so I won't publicly reccommend this.

Though there are some good things, the bad outweighs them:\n\nThe good:\n\n- Pretty good graphics and audio\n- It does give the feeling of really being in the driver seat of a bus\n- City is fairly expansive and laid out pretty well\n\nThe bad:\n\n- The controls are clunky and laid out terribly\n- Was unable to see out of the mirrors at all, even with the highest graphics detail\n- There is a tutorial mode, though it could be a lot more in-depth about what is going on\n- If you changed a keybind in options, that would not be reflected in the tutorial, and since some things named in the tutorial      are not named the same thing in the control settings it can really be confusing\n- There is no explaination of what kinds of menus the function keys on the keyboard will bring up, you wouldn't even know those menus are there if you didn't accidentally hit the buttons and it popped up\n- I tried making both male and female characters on the screen where you have to enter name/birthday/sex...etc.., regardless of the sex you choose, you will be a male that is way too overdressed to be a bus driver\n\nOverall though this game has a great concept, the execution is atrocious.  Not sure as to why it has so many positive ratings, but no matter how hard I try I am unable to fathom anything about this game that would make it worth any kind of money.  Someday hopefully there will be a bus simulation that is on par with ETS2, until then there will be no bus driving for me.\n\nMy recommenation is to save your money or get ETS2 if you don't mind a really good truck driving simulator.\n\n- Phil","July 31, 2014","false","1.1"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

The AI regularly behave extremely dumb (for example running into you while you're turning in a narrow street), the board computer is super complicated to use (...and I can calculate 10-2.20 myself, thanks), the stock version only has a few lines it makes me jot down a bunch of numbers just to get going anywhere. And don't get me started on the steering, it's unintuitive and (as another reviewer pointed out) feels like driving a shopping cart. The game lacks any real form of tutorial (apart from "Press these buttons to start a bus" and "Press Up to accelerate"), so that drives the frustration-meter up even further.\n\nI would only recommend this game to someone who has a veeeery high frustration tolerance.","January 12, 2014","false","2.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deangeddes/recommended/253770/","deangeddes","DeanGeddes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deangeddes/","13 products in account","Firstly, I'd like to start by saying that this is not a very good game. It has its pros and cons though (there are many more cons).\nHere are some of the pros:\n- You can freely drive your bus around the city.\n- The interior design of the bus is quite nice.\n- Lots of camera views, especially in the driver's seat.\n- All of the switches, buttons, and levers in the cab do something, (no dummy buttons).\n- Lots of routes to drive around the city.\n- You can walk around (free movement).\n\nHowever, the cons include:\n- Only one game mode.\n- No driving tutorial, you are expected to learn yourself.\n- They make you remember a password at the start of the first ever game that you then have to put in to make the cash register work every time at the start of each game!\n- The interior mirror does not reflect so you cannot see passengers getting on or off the bus from the driver's seat. So you are totally reliant on exterior views.\n- Too many pedestrians. For example, sometimes you get huge traffic jams on the road because there are never endless flows of pedestrians crossing, which clog up the cars on the street.\n- Bad controller support! I have never been able to get my wheel to work in this game and it is almost impossible to drive with the keyboard!\n- Cash register very complicated to work and there is also no tutorial.\n- The bus announcements are in German only, despite it saying on the Steam Store page that the game includes 'Full Audio' in English.\n- If you crash into another vehicle, you have to wait 30 seconds before it becomes invisible and you can drive on.\n- It is impossible to drive around tight bends without hitting a vehicle on the inside.\n\nThere are also faults with the game, for example:\n- Quite often someone rings the bell to get off, but when you open the back and front doors at the next bus stop, no-one gets off.\n- When driving towards a bus stop, you cannot tell if some of the pedestrians are walking to the bus stop to get on your bus, or are just going to walk straight past, because their heads only look forwards.\n- The cash register sometimes just stops working and you cannot press any keys.\n- It is not very realistic because the stop bell always gets rung at exactly the same number of seconds after driving past or leaving the previous bus stop. In real life, it could be rung at any time between stops.","December 17, 2015","false","21.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Bus simulator 2012 is a very unique and indie bus game that is let's you simulate being a bus driver. This game is very in depth and so in depth it's very intimidating to start off. When I first bought Bus simulator 2012 I put about 20 minutes and couldn't figure out how to start my bus, so after that I threw it to the side and didn't come back to it for a few months. I really wanted to love this game, I like buses and I couldn't find a good bus sim but after a lot of troubleshooting I got my bus started and was able to play the game.\n\nHere is the good parts of the game. It's very fun, I love the feeling of driving and trying to stay on time and try not to screw up. I also like the price, it's very cheap and if you really like buses then you could put many hours into this game. The Bus is fairly nice you can play it as an amature or play it as a bus efficantio. I like the amount of bus routes that are available to drive it gives a lot of replayability to the game. Overall it's very fun and it feels nice to drive.\n\nAlthough the game is fun there are many problems with bus simulator 2012. One of the major issues is how extremely buggy it is. It's far from finished and it doesn't look like the developer is still updating the game which is a shame. Another of the games major problems is the city's design, the city isn't very well planed out. There are stop lights that don't make sense and there are stos with major congestion. I also dislike the mirror quality in the buses. The Mirrors on the bus are almost useless and the resolution of the mirror is also low. At high settings the mirrors work but they barely show anything, most of the time you just have to blindly change lanes and that can often be a problem. Another problem is the passengers animation. The passengers move extremely slow and you can not tell which pedestrians are trying to get on your bus and who isn't. It's also very hard to drive and make some turns, it took alot of pratice to get use to the buses size and how best to best maneuver the vehicle. I do wish their was an option to respawn your bus close to where you were, it became very frustrating to have to respawn the bus and start the route over because I got stuck in the fenses. Although the most frustrating part is the lack of a saving function. The saves don't work so you basicly have to start over your game once you quite. It doesn't affect the gameplay much but you have to write down your new driver id and password which is frustrating at most. Overall it's a good game but it has many major flaws.\n\nBus simulator 2012 is a very fun realist bus game with it's peaks and with it's flaws. It's really fun to play and the bus seems fairly heavy. I would like to see the developer put more effort into updating fixing bugs and polishing up their game. I feel It's not perfect but it can be really fun depending on how much time you are willing to put in. It's has major flaws but I would recommend this game to any person who likes buses and would like to drive one. 3/5","June 4, 2015","true","49.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I started using my flight simulator Joystick for control but realised you can activate mouse control when no controllers are connected to the computer. This mode made the game a lot more enjoyable and made it easy to toggle between view and driving (Highly Recommend you try it). Most of the negative comments on this game are from people that fail to read the pdf document in the installation folder giving clear steps on how to drive.\n\nThe best feature of this sim is the ability to make your own routes but be careful as there are a few errors on the map in the pdf. Stop 360 doesn't exist and stop 352 in the ZOB (Bus station) should be stop 452.\n\nOverall good if you want a cheap bus sim and don't mind a few glitches.\n\nPro:\nRoute editor\nModern Buses\nLarge Map to explore\n\nCons:\nMap repetitive\nPassengers often freeze\nCars freeze, gridlock or sink in a few locations\nOccasional crashes and glitches","June 13, 2015","true","196.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The frame rate drops randomly as you play, and there is no background loading going on, so when your view distance needs to update the frame rate just chugs. I have played around with the graphics settings and this is a issue even on medium.\n\nThe tutorial is not well done, and I got stuck a few times, having to look for answers online.\n\nThere is only 1 bus, and no real selection.\n\nThe controls are poorly implemented and difficult to use, for example it is almost impossible to judge and make turns in some places. They make you use the arrow keys instead of wasd, why they did this is beyond me.\n\nThe AI traffic isn't really that smart, and they will often block your path and get way too close boxing you in. So I turned the traffic density to the halfway mark, and all of a sudden there were like hardly any cars on the road.\n\nThere is a bug where passengers just get stuck and block others from getting on, forcing a restart.\n\nOverall this is a poorly optimized, poorly implemented, buggy simulator. I would not recommend this for $10, this game is so bad it should be free.","December 3, 2013","false","6.7"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

It is like 1/2 the price so don't bother with OMSI, get this.\n\nNew review: Eh... my old review is totally wrong. OMSI is way better this lags like mad and there is a bad bus selection (1 Regular bus, 1 Articulated Bus, No double decker buses). Acceleration is pretty slow on the buses. Oh..... and the AI vehicles frequently mess up. This sometimes causes a Huge traffic jam, not moving. The only thing you can do it either Restart or drive on the wrong side of the road/path to get through..... AI Vehicles also arent very well programmed and often break rules of the road.","January 3, 2014","false","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

You need to press multiple keys in sequence to get a bus moving at ALL, - passwords and driver number on the ignition?  seriously? (why ffs? are you scared of people stealing virtual buses?), & issuing tickets? games are supposed to be FUN, if I wanted to be a bus nerd I`d put an anorak & glasses on and go and stand on my street corner with a notepad,\n\n(come to think of it, that might be more fun).\n\nI bought this under the mistaken impression I could just jump in a bus and go, mount kerbs, throw people out of the bus windows and mow people down, then drive it through the nearest shopping mall, burn it and dance around naked, but I suspect this game would throw you back to the start for not issuing the correct ticket for that....\nNot one of my better purchases.","July 22, 2015","false","1.2"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
