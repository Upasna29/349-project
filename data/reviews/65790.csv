It was just mind blowing, at that point there simply were no game with such an broad scope and such a powerful imersion.\n\nThe story takes place in the good´n old 80´s, when there were real intenational tension and warfare wasn´t a matter of eletronics, laser targeting and remote vehicles.\nA crazy russian general takes a nuke, a division of the red army and a lot of tanks and takes over some islands in the north atlantic, but those islands are under NATO protection, so the war begins.\n\nDuring the game you take the role of 4 soldier with distinct roles in the army. A foot soldier, a tank pilot, a chopper pilot and a black ops expert. With all 4 you climb up in the ranks, starting as a grunt and ending up in commanding large groups of units on the battlefield. It also ends in delivering a very diverse experience, as you play on several unique missions and control an interesting variety of ground and air vehicles.\n\nThe gameplay is rather chunky, the movement is very limited, it all seems weird at first, but it is actually very immersive. There is one of the great virtues of the game, its realistic aproach to combined arms warfare. If you imagine that a soldier is carrying over 20kgs of equipment and ammo, it would be really hard to run and jump as you do in Call of Duty.\nWithout planning and the right resources, there´s nothing a squad of soldiers can do agains an armored vehicle, and the importance of air support is acurately shown.\nThe game is very unforgiving, the damage system works like this: Shot in the legs, and you can´t stand. Shot in the arms, you cant aim. Shot twice and you die. Shot in the head, game over.\nThis actually works out very well, as this system forces the player to play cautiously, and adopt real world strategies to stay alive. You are forced to take cover, to look around for enemies before moving, to pay attention to orders and intel in order to not fall in a trap or get flanked.\n\nAnother strong point from this game is the support developers gave to the community. The game was designed to be easily modded, and the developers were very active in the community, patching the game and implementing features that the players asked for.\nThe game also featured an mission editor mode, wich was the same used by the developers to create the main campaign, allowing players to create their own missions at will, sharing with other players or even creating awesome co-op or PvP missions.\nIt was a very new thing at the time, and the community was very solid. This philosophy is still kind of rare, but it was always part of the Arma series, and Arma 3 specifically targets for a relevant community participation in game developing and content creation.\n\n\nOperation Flashpoint was improved in nearly every aspect along the Arma series, but still stands as the game that started it all.\n\nIts vast open terrain, flexible and diverse gameplay, realistic aproach and some trully memorable events changed the landscape of the military games and still survives as an enjoiable game.\n\nIn it´s time it deserved a 10/10.\n\nToday, we can see that it aged well, and still attracts attention as milestone in millitary simulation. 8/10","November 29, 2013","true","1.1"," 524 of 558 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","524","558","0","9"

RIFLEMAN, 200 METRES! SOUTH-EAST!"\n\nMy childhood, rests right here. Don't let the title fool you, this is Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis. One of the first realistic army sims of it's time. It has been renamed as such after the scummy devs from Codemasters fully acquired the rights to the title from Bohemia Interactive, and ruined the franchise to hell and back realising they don't have the "Czech touch" to games like this, spawning awful games such as Dragon Rising and Red River.\n\nNaturally this game got later rebranded after Bohemia released ARMA, the spiritual successor to OpFlashpoint. It lacks one of the expansions, Red Hammer, due to it's partial ownership to Codemasters, but it's easily downloadable.\n\nMy childhood of dicking about in the world editor, spawning in yourself with jets and jeeps to roam the huge islands, and slavic inspired villages,  Brings a tear to my eye to this day. Naturally this game is even better on LAN or with something like Evolve.\n\nSure, you could buy Arma 2 or 3, but this is where it all began. Good for a laugh at the primitive graphics or if you want to take a trip down memory lane, and appreciate it's start.\n\n10/10 buy it now, it's not even that expensive","October 19, 2014","true","2.1"," 198 of 215 people (92%) found this review helpful 43 people found this review funny","92","198","215","43","0"

Got it on steam on a sale recently and tried it again.  Single player campaign is awesome (really!) and got me hooked again. Pretty hard though. Atm I'm lost in enemy land where you can try to be bold and get to primary pickup point quickly, or go alternate routes with more time and patience involved.\n\nMany vehicles and helicopters can be driven/flown and houses entered for cover. Missions have countless ways to be executed. On one I remember veering completely off the logical path and ran out into the countryside where I after some time found an enemy team guarding a Mi-28 Havoc. I managed to overcome them and steal the chopper which resulted in a very interesting and different end to that part of the campaign. This is single player I'm talking about still. ;)\n\nOnly one save per mission even on standard difficulty so no run and gun in this military simulator. Needless to say, you have to be very patient, constantly on the move and very tactical or it's a quick game over.\n\nBe prepared for pathing problems and the occasional AI getting stuck needing reload to continue. Trigger points to end the mission can also be troublesome sometimes.\n\nOther than that, I still think it's one of the finest games ever released. Highly entertaining but also very challenging, as it should be.","November 26, 2013","true","3.0"," 134 of 147 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","134","147","0","0"

Ok the graphics where slated from the start, but at the time NOBODY had whole island you could drive arround for hours, CS maps are stamp sized compared to the almost limitless world found in this game. Hence something had to be reduced, and that was the bitmap and model quality. However, the game play, quirky AI (some times they do funny things them AI), and a great story. It's got a steep (not CS player friendly) VERRY steep learning curv, but once you have it mastered, you will love this game. You can only save once per mission, is a master piece, which forces you to re-appraise your tactics. Brutally hard in places, epic in others. I actually think the views down a valley, with tanks (oh and the sound is ace too) rolling in with smoking engines and dust... was just beautiful. It for me, is the defining open world game too. Here's an example, there's a mission to take out a scud launcher. Time is limited, you have a load of men, some trucks and I think an APC and Jeep. I spent a couple of days trying to complete this mission, and then I thought about what happens in the mission. At a certain point, an enemy chopper attacks (a hind I think), so that made me think, where did that come from... so I worked out it's arrival vector (seriously) and then the next mission I send the guys to 'distract' most of the enemy forces, whilst I took the Jeep and raced in the direction the chopper would later arrive from... sure enough several KM away, there was a field with the Hind and several pilots, some support vehicles and a landing pad. So what? Well this is an open world, so I shot the pilots and soldiers, stole the Hind, flew to the SCUD launcher, blew it to pieces and was home in time for supper. Another time, I dumped in the middle of nowhere, in the dark and must head to a specific direction... it's didn't take me that long to work out to use the Pole Star to get a bearing... priceless gaming at it's absolute best. TBH most all of the new 'versions' of ARMA (which follwed this game), where not as good, no or little story, but better (and slower) graphics sure. But I think like chess (which I've played a great game with bits of tissue with letters on as the pieces at an Airport..), it's not really how it looks, it's not how slick the controls are (they are a little clunky), it just every little thing else. That is why, this is probably STILL the best gaming experience of my entire life, and I'm not sure (like a first love!), I'll ever quite get that feeling again, no matter how good anything new looks.... At this price, it's a gift and should be in everyones collection. :o)","November 15, 2015","true","46.9"," 90 of 93 people (97%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","97","90","93","7","2"

The graphics are dated. The controls are clunky and sometimes illogical. Flight is difficult, as you can barely render in the ground without crashing. The AI is infuriatingly good at some times. Its freaking brilliant.\n\nAs you can see by the ammount of hours i've sunk into this game, its a damn good game that, if treated correctly, can be played for a long, long time. The AI makes the game an actual challange (something many modern mainstream shooters lack theese days) and, when you fall to the ground in a hail of AK-47 bullets, you know its probably because you did something wrong. The mission editor is one of the best features - it has allowed me and a small group based around this game to access hunderends of user-created mission for our multiplayer sessions, preventing us from getting bored of the same-old, same-old.\n\nModding is another great factor; its very simple to install mods (and, admittidly, break your game) which can range from a few extra units to a total conversion. I'm currently running with the WGL5 mod, which adds much improved animations, models, weapons and a rudimentry medical system.\n\nDefinatly worth a play.

Although it came out in 2001, it is still not outdated, and I regularly play it in 2013. The reason why is because it has so much potential. First, there are two official campaigns, that take place in a possible Cold War conflict, which escalates into armed confrontation. You play either as a infantryman or a squad leader, but can also access any unoccupied land/sea/air vehicle should you need or want to. Every mission in this game in non-linear, so it offers unique experience each time you play it. Story is believable and takes a realistic approach towards waging a war (you are not always on the offensive - sometimes retreat can be regarded as a strategic success). In addition to that, there are many separate single missions that offer a new perspective on the original story. But the real benefit comes with tons of free addons, created by modders. That way, you can expand the game with countless new units, weapons, vehicles, missions and even campaigns if you want. Some are even total conversions, which improve graphics and gameplay mechanics too.\n\nSpeaking of wich, I have to mention that default gameplay mechanics appeal to me very much, especially looking around and aiming. In my opinion this game feels better and easier to play than its successors in the game series.\nThe only area that lacks a bit is AI driving. It can sometimes miss the road and break immersion, but otherwise it's ok.\n\nBut my favourite feature (that you should absolutely try) is mission editor. It is easy to use and combined with the previously mentioned addons, you can design and play in your own playground of destruction. You can instantly play your missions as you design them, so you can test different approaches and decide whether to actively participate in them or just be a mere observer. You can create massive battles with air, land and sea units or just small skirmishes to try different tactics. The only barrier is your imagination and I still haven't reached it in more than 10 years of experience.\n\nI definitely recommend this game - its value far exceeds its price.","December 27, 2013","true","13.7"," 64 of 71 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","64","71","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Terminally-Chill/recommended/65790/","Terminally-Chill","SHARKE BYTE","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Terminally-Chill/","810 products in account","Cool game. I actually played through it a month or so ago off Steam and it's a lot of fun. Originally released as Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis, this is a tactical Cold War shooter. It hasn't aged that well and the voice acting is quite wonky but it has an excellent campaign which is the main reason why I picked it up. It's more of a thinking man's shooter, and after a few missions you'll be put in charge of a squad which you can order around. I was really surprised at how well the squad mechanics worked, it's not just a worthless gimmick. It was quite fun playing this game in contrast to ArmA 3 and seeing how the series got started and has evolved. Unlike the ArmA 3 campaign this one featured a greater variety of missions, there's stealth missions, tank missions, heli missions, even one where you fly the A-10. While the outdated graphics place a lot of limits on how large scale the battles are, the game still has pretty good draw distance for its time which makes tank battles really feel like tank missions (after the first tank mission I hated them, by the last tank mission I loved them). If you're a fan of Cold War stuff there is a lot in here, you'll be running from BMPs loaded with Soviet troops, supported by HINDs and T80s rolling around destroying everything while the SHILKA denies friendly air support. This is all accompanied by a great original soundtrack which I feel was a little hampered by the poorly chosen licensed music. The difficulty picked up significantly during the last few missions (I actually had to resort GameFaqs, something I haven't done in a while) but overall the game is very playable aside from a couple crashes and bugs. So in conclusion it's not perfect, but still a great tactical Cold War shooter that's worth picking up for free.\n\nFavorite quote (something you should get used to hearing):\n\n"Fall back into formation."\n. . .\n"WHERE ARE YOU?!?"","May 16, 2014","true","0.1"," 53 of 61 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","53","61","0","6"

To give you a little background, the main campaign sets you on a belic war between the USA and what seems to be Russia. You have to fight the hostile forces, drive your allies from point A to point B, recon the surrounding areas of your camp, and many more things.\n\nThe graphics are okay for it's time, the game puts you into an open, inmense world all for you. The music is pretty good too, you'll be hearing it a lot during the battle. But what his game has that others don't (I'm looking at you COD and BF) is actual tacticool warfare, you follow or give orders, play smart as a group, and a lot of other cool stuff.\n\nThis is the first Arma, so if you want to get into the series I'd recommend you go for Arma 3 instead, a much better version.","January 13, 2015","true","26.5"," 40 of 43 people (93%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","93","40","43","9","0"

The only downside is that its missing a working multiplayer (it has MP support, but there aren't any active servers sadly), which would really make the game a lot more cooler just like the other games in the Arma series.\n\nAnd yes, the graphics aren't as good as they are today, but it does give a bit of a nostalgic feeling to it, I mean, just look at those face textures, put a bullet in them, now look at them again! And yes, there are a few bugs and glitches which aren't exactly sorted out, but it doesn't matter, nor does it take away from the game, yes, even the flying bodies after explosions don't take it away, despite how funny it looks to see a body flying across the landscape.\n\nStoryline is, meh, not really a stretch, but there are some moments the game will really give you with it. I will even mention, the outdated dialogue alongside the radio transmissions are always fun to hear, really, it is, just listen to Kowalski arguing!\n\nThe game also comes with the amazing mission editor, just like in the rest of the Arma games, make your own missions and such, it's pretty fun when boredom is not an option, while it doesn't give as much as the other Arma games do, it suffices enough to keep you screwing around with for more.\n\nIs it worth buying? YES. Especially since it's only 4€, it's a perfect price worth taking, especially since its rather old, but nevertheless, gold. While of course I still wish it had a few servers around that I could play in with some other people, and perhaps a bit of workshop avilability (this game CAN be modded, though its really hard to find any good mods around the internet lately, either that, or I'm just bad at searching) to make the game more fun to play with, in any case, this is still one of my games that made my war loving childhood, and I wish for it to get into the hearts of many people of today, to give them the taste of what amazing masterpieces games like these were back in the days.\n\nOh, and remember to use cover and prone a lot, those AI might have a dumb coding which makes them go into crawl mode from simply hearing a single gunshot, and run-stop-run around, but they aren't exactly forgiving if they see you running around an open area in the distance, not to mention aimbot you at mid ranges if you aren't smart enough to duck behind cover in time, just a friendly advice, is all.","July 28, 2015","true","11.0"," 42 of 51 people (82%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","82","42","51","7","5"

This game absolutely blew my mind with it's open world playing field. Unlike any other games that were out there, the only boundary that existed was the water, unless you were in an air or water vehicle, then you could essentially drive that boat or plane for infinity with no land in sight and the water and sky would continue to regenerate. I played this game for 2 years before I ever opened the editor. When I did that, I was hooked for life. It was the first game that introduced me to player mods and I must have downloaded every free addon and mission I could find. I also learned about scripting while using the editor and expanding the fun that much more. It still survives today among a limited community on the BIStudio Forums[forums.bistudio.com] and you can find those free player made addons here at http://ofp.gamepark.cz/ as well as years of editing discussion at OFPEC[www.ofpec.com] The Editing Center. These sites contain a ton of free user made missions/campaigns/islands as well. This title may contain outdated graphics, but the game play is still better than many modern day titles of this current period.\n\nDefinitely worth paying the current price to play through the well made campaigns as well as some of the user made missions.

Previously named Operation flash point : Cold War Crisis.\n\nReleased back in 2001 a military simulation of might have happend if Cold war actually happend.\n\nFirst off if you are into Call of duty (COD) and/or into scripted\ncorridor shooter's then let me tell you right of the bat that this game is not for you.\n\nShall we began\n\nStory\nWhile not going to spoil it for you but let me tell you it's very well done. Most people may think that it has no story or what so over but before you make that judgment let me tell you it's there and it's amazing just progress over the missions and you will see. And your character also talks here yes in cutscenes as well.\n\nSoundtrack\nOver a big total of  track's in total. All macthing the game in various way's and mostly just Epic.\n\nGameplay\nThe main part. Does it live up to rest of the game?\n\nSurely it does let me tell you why. Realistic in a big way and in many aspects. First of all teamwork,strategy,proper planning is the key here or else you wont survive for long. Item pick up system. Crouching and going prone required for proper gun handling. Hud doesn't tell you your health nor your clips remaining bullets, leaving on you to precisely reload or you might just waste up your ammo. And the gun play well certainly the recoil here is pretty low compared to real guns but still gun play is fleunt. And very un scripted you also dont get screemed at for leaving the scripted area because of course  we cant let you do that or else "sigh" you will destory the special scripted part "sigh". Well guess what? Theres non of that ♥♥♥♥ here.\n\nControls\nWhile overly complicated for many people but just right once you fully adopt them. I would say most new people would get frustrated but just a word of advice take your time and try to adopt to them and you will be doing just fine.\n\nAi\nOne of best here while buggy at times but still best for it's time till now. Responsive. Do team work. And can even track you if a explosion near occured or from lights of flare. And let me tell you a little story and you will see how cool is that. I was playing one of the missions in this one a head or whatever comes to check you at night after after checking he leaves back in is whatever vehicle but you can shoot down its tyres and then he will go back on feet but on then on theway he will also help you shoot down some soldiers at night. Now how cool is that? You see they actually do have a mind.\n\nGraphics\nWhile the textures are mostly pretty bad but overall still pretty good here and worth watchable different types of options as well in all still a pass here.\n\nAmount of play time\nMore than 40 hours with a total off 43 campaign mission's.\n\nConclusion\nFully worth the price only 10 dollars for a gem like this. Id say get it if you can deal with some of the problems and odd controls.\n\nGood story,combat, entertaining. While some clunky controls and a little rough around the edges but overall a classic.\n===================================================================\n\nJoin our Giveaway Group and win every month over 2100 Steam Keys (Daily 70 keys) We love to share!\nClick to join our Giveaway Group!\nClick me and follow us as Curator","September 4, 2015","true","51.2"," 36 of 51 people (71%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","71","36","51","4","0"

Some of the missions are quite tricky and may require multiple tries, which coupled with the limited saves per mission can get very frustrating.\n\nInfantry operations are the most fun part of the game. Messing with tanks is tolerable and flying vehicles are annoying. I especially enjoyed that not all missions were about running into a village and gunning everyone down, but required stealth or simply survival.\n\nGame is pretty old and graphics reflects this.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RemrotS/recommended/65790/","RemrotS","RemrotS","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RemrotS/","36 products in account","ArmA: Cold War Assault REVIEW\nMany years ago in a time called 2001 came a legend called Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis and it gained many rewards along with a expansion pack called Resistance and even got Game Of The Year. But then around a ayear before ArmA: Armed Assault came out Codemasters and Bohemia had some troubles and split and Codemasters took the rights to the name Operation  Flashpoint and got re-released in 2011 under the name ArmA: Cold War Assault.\n\nArmA: CWA is a military shooter/military simulator that is set during 1985 at the height of the Cold War. Soviet forces invade a bunch of islands and thats where you come in as apart of the U.S. army which is all I know.\n\nThe graphics haven't aged well over the years and don't live up to todays standards. Textures being quite blurry and models are low-poly don't look nice but I guess computers weren't power beasts back in 2001 to be able to render some very large maps like Everon, Malden or Nogova which is the largest there.\n\nSounds aren't to bad, ambient sounds being the best and the weapon sounds are lacking but do deliver a nice feeling of power. There is little ambient combat sounds which makes it hard to detect how far and where the fire is coming from but you do have a direction of where it might be coming from.\n\nYou have the basics of shooter elements W,A,S,D move you around the map as a infantrymen. Z prones and Q goes crouch Q stands you up which is odd but you get used to it. Many more controls in-game but I'll explain vehicle controls. The basics when in any ground vehicle Q is slow speed, W is medium speed, E is fast speed, A turns left, D turns right and S goes backwards. Aircraft is a different story which would be best to learn in-game.\n\nThere is selection of weapons and vehicles on each side and they have equal power to their opposing side. Sometimes even having a strong point and a weak point like the West side's Jeep is weakly protected but is faster than the more armoured East side's UAZ which is slower but can fit more people. Tanks have equal strength and power like the M60 is equal to the T-72 (unsure about the Resistance T-55.)\n\nIts missions can get buggy and glitchy but thats only the missions.\nThe multiplayer servers are no longer online but you can download programs to see servers so it isn't fully dead yet.\n\nOverall I think its a decent game worth the money, it may be old but it still lives up as a good game and is GREAT when modded to utter-♥♥♥♥!\n\nI would give the game a 8/10 but with the community sitting behind it with thousands of mods to improve and add to the game I give it a 9 out of 10 and if theres anything I shoudl add to this review you can tell them in the comments and have a great day.","September 2, 2014","true","219.1"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

Seriously how many negative revews are there whinning about this game having "bad graphics" and that for a game in 2011 it looks really bad...\n\n"Arma: Cold War Assault" is the retitled game by Bohemia interactive known as "Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis" and it was made in 2001. Yes a full 10 ♥♥♥♥ing years older than these idiots are claming it to be. It was renamed in 2011 by Bohemia (the original developers and creators of the "Arma" series) in order to draw a gap between it and the Horrible "game" by codmasters  Operation Flashpoint: Dragon rising". Because Codemasters kept the rights to the name, bohemia couldn't carry on their series under that said name so they created ArmA, but only in 2011 did they actually rename their original game Operation Flashpoint to mark it more as their property which it is.\n\nSoooooooo. Oh a 13 year old game? not 3 years? OOOOOooooooo\nWhat AMAYZING Graphics\nWhat AMAYZING Controls\nWhat AMAYZING Possibilities\nSeriously this game let's you do what you want, you can be a soldier, a tank commander, a helicopter pilot, a truck driver... Be anything, Do anything, make your own missions, or just play the extensive and challenging campaing. Calling this masterpiece and cornerstone of war simulation a "piece of ♥♥♥♥" is sickening at best and comes from a crowd of 13 year old COD players who wern't even born when this titan of a game was released. So please all you idiots who can't tell a 13 year old game from a 3 year old one, just refrain from posting your poisonous oppinions and atemting to tarnish the imaculate reputation of the greatest war simulation franchize of all time and one of the best game series out there. Also if as most of these kids you truly believe that COD is a better game... just keep your oppinions to yourself, because this just isn't the game for you. I don't go around throwing punches at Final Fantasy because I know I'm not the target audience and such an exercise would simply be... Pointless.\n\nThank you, and I hope someday a lot of you will do a little research before "revewing" a game, let alone actually play the game.","May 29, 2014","true","23.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/roastbroast/recommended/65790/","roastbroast","Mantaloupe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/roastbroast/","124 products in account","This is quite the interesting game. I got it, seeing how I've shown some interest in ArmA, I have a low-end PC and the game itself was pretty cheap. Needless to say, I was far from disappointed.\n\nBut to prevent others from being disappointed, let me make one thing clear:  This game, in terms of realism and style, is nothing, and I mean nothing like Call of Duty or Battlefield. Those games try to be cinematic and intense, leaning on explosoins and special effects that almost trump Michael Bay in terms of how ridiculous and frequent they are. ArmA, at least this one, tries to approach genuine military simulation, and it shows.\n\nFor example, let's look at the damage model:  A shot to the legs, you can't walk, a shot to either arm, and you can't shoulder-fire your weapon, a shot to the head? Well, unless you're a courier stuck in a desert, let's just say you won't be stumblign back up. For most, it's two pops and you, your allies, or your targets are dead; none of this life bar that slowly regenerates which the newer Battlefield and CoD games do for whatever reason. If you're hurt, you need to call a medic, no easy way out.\n\nAlso, vehicles. You can't just hop into a tank by yourself and go and wreak havoc. You must get into a vehicle, and depending on the circumstances, you must crew it (If it's a multi-person vehicle), rearm it, repair it and refuel it, call it your Three R's. Like with a tank, while there *is* a manual fire option, I suggest not using it, as it only aims in the direction that the weapon is last fixed in. So you must have a commander tell the driver where to go, and the gunner where to shoot. Operating on a team is absolutely vital to winning. Which means team participation and roles are imperative to the gameplay.\n\nMy only qualms lay in the graphics and the voice acting. I've seen some pretty impressive titles come out of the year 2001, (Does the name "Halo" ring a bell?) and the graphics are blocky, choppy and overall unpleasant to look at. I like that they tried to make character models more organic; not just a bunch of cardboard stiffs, but for some reason the design of their faces make them look perpetually stoned out of their minds. The environments can look a little dull at times, and I can't help but look at trees and bushes that behave almost like cardboard cutouts--like pieces of paper being flattened as you run over them. However, building and vehicle models are rather well done, and guns look pretty good too. The voice acting sounds a little...odd. The way some of the folks in campaign talk in ways that almost seem hammy, Koslowski being the most poignant display of this in my humble opinion. However, I don't mind this too much. Even if the graphics are lackluster, at least it can run on my PC, which has a rather outdated GPU (Has 256MB VRAM, substantially less than the norm)\n\nSo, if you're looking for a good first-person shooter you can hop into, maybe this shouldn't be your first choice. However, if you want a game that gives you a realistic simulation of the different theaters of combat, and you want to live out what it must've been like in 1985 to see everyone's hate of the USSR before the Iron Curtain fell, and just to overall enjoy yourself in a good first-person shooter that you don't need a top-notch PC to run, then ArmA:  Cold War Assault's your game.","April 19, 2014","true","10.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Interesting just for that. A "Dads Game" that the kids played as well, and actually featured on some of the early british television PC gaming shows as a regular feature with teams playing each other on a LAN in a TV studio.\nIf you are an Arma fan its an historic addition to your collection, if you are not an Arma fan, move on, there is probably nothing for you here, Arma 2 or its standalone "expansion" Operation Arrowhead  or the superb Arma1 (Armed Assault) will give you a much nicer graphical and play experience plus a host of free addons and community mods you you will never have enough time on your hands to get through them all, and then there is steam online multiplayer for Arma2 (plus DayZ mod) now that gamespy has gone.\nSo really, there is so much more in the Arma games which followed on from Cold War Assault that you won't play this much. But there will be something missing from your Arma collection if you don't have it.\nPick it up free when you can, and marvel at what us old people used to think was state of the art back in the day :-/","May 16, 2014","true","0.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

A slightly modified version called VBS is used by many western militaries for training. Like Battlefield or GTA, one can fight on foot, drive trucks and tanks, sail boats, and fly aircraft. Equip and command a squad of up to 12, directing movement, position, formation, engagement, and more with greater control than Ghost Recon or Freedom Fighters offered. The ballistic models necessitate compensation for bullet drop and leading of moving targets. Injuries to certain parts of the body can cripple; a wounded leg will reduce one to crawling, and a damaged arm will detract from ones ability to use their weapon.  Navigate expansive terrain with map and compass or follow the stars. Play through the campaign, challenge friends in multiplayer *, and design your own sharable scenarios in the mission editor.\nThe developer and the community even share tools for creating your own maps, units, vehicles, weapons, etc..\n\nSmall arms handling and movement are less smooth than Call Duty, and the default models are blocky and their textures have low resolution. This allows for better performance, but if more detailed models and skins are desired, they can be had in community mods and addons. Default controls are unlike any other shooter, but can be easily changed in the Options - controls menu with a click of the "esc" button. The VON is broken, and should never be used or it can cause problems.\n\nCold War Assault takes place in the 1980s amid a fictional clash between the U.S.A. and U.S.S.R..\n\n* Gamespy support for multiplayer ended in 2014, so use OFPmonitor to browse MP servers, or use Tunngle, Hamachi, or Gameranger.\n\nThese sites offer additional information, content, and utilities:\n\nhttps://community.bistudio.com/\nhttp://dslyecxi.com/ofp.html (WGL links broken, see video description or moddb)\nhttp://dslyecxi.com/ofpttp.html\nhttp://www.ofpec.com/index.php\nhttp://ofp.gamepark.cz/\nhttp://ofp-faguss.com/index.php\nMultiplayer\nhttps://github.com/Poweruser/OFPMonitor/releases\nhttps://github.com/Poweruser/PowerServer/releases\nhttp://www.tunngle.net/index.php?l=en\nhttps://secure.logmein.com/products/hamachi/download.aspx\nhttp://www.gameranger.com/\nhttp://www.teamspeak.com/\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/realistictacticalgaming\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rHXOaCufMQ","April 28, 2013","true","533.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I managed to put many hours into the first few days playing this non stop.\n\nThe age of this game hasn't age all that well for some people if they judge by graphics, but if you are like me and focus on gameplay alone, then this is an excellent game. In my opinion this has just been the copy for the newer Arma games because I played them all and I can say for sure that they all were just a copy and paste from this one with just a newer engine and updated graphics.\n\nBut with that beside us, let me get down to the pros/cons\n\nPros:\nVery realistic and our own military uses the newer arma games for some training programs and demonstrations\nNice mods that implement many more campaigns, WW2, Vietnam, ect\nGreat teamwork online(yes people still play)\nWith mods, improvement in graphics and sounds\nOverhaul, excellent and get this if your hardware can't handle the newer arma games\n\nCons:\nWithout mods, not so great graphics/sounds\nSome hiccups for an older engine\nUI for editor is ok, make sure to have it on advance,\n\n\n\nThats it, I highly recomment it, thanks!\n","July 29, 2014","true","44.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Gameplay itself is frustratingly hard, unlike CoD, Battlefield, and many other FPS shooters you can't charge around a corner and hope to still live. You can't rush head on into a group of soldiers and expect a victorious outcome. You will die, over and over and over again. It's very hard - but it's also much more realistic because of it.\n\nI got this game so that I may give it a good review based off past playthroughs, I'm hoping I can do the same again on Steam.","December 1, 2014","true","0.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","71","5","7","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DarkPopulous/recommended/65790/","DarkPopulous","DarkPopulous™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DarkPopulous/","114 products in account","A blast from the past, this was my most played game on the original Xbox. The graphics aren't fantastic but don't let that lead you away. The gameplay is by far more than worth the money, there's 2 campaigns "Cold war assault" and "Resistance". Ontop of that there's a bunch of scenario's you can try.\n\nThis isn't a run and gun game! You have to plan things out and sometimes things won't go according to plan, you're a squishy human being who will die in one or two shots. But this makes victory all the more satisfying and fortunately your enemies share this same weakness, making it way more realistic than any other shooter released at the time.\n\nAnd there's the editor.... oh boi, this made me feel like i was playing with plastic toy soldiers again, you have the ability to create your own scenario's giving you the abilitiy to make your own fun.  Unfortunetly for those who have played ArmA 2 and ArmA 3 you won't find the editor that great. It's easy to notice what features weren't around when Operation flashpoint came out.

For those who want a concise military shooter with consequences if you don't find cover, you've come to the right place. Players are given one save per mission, and the open world approach makes the ideal path to victory very unclear. So long as you don't die, you can at least finish a mission (even if it's an utter disaster). This puts stress on the player to complete objectives as well as survive. Due to the liberties given to the player, I give the campaign an honest 7/10.\n\nThe core gameplay itself will be harder to review because of how much it hits and misses. I'll start with the positive. The shooting is fun. You can either do this from third person, first person, or from ironsights. Each perspective gives the player distinct advantages that the others don't give. There's also the feel of the vehicles. They are easy to control, and very fun once mastery of the controls is attained. It doesn't matter if you're in a chopper, a tank, or a jeep; I have never had so much fun driving a vehicle in a game before. However, that's not the full story. The controls are awkward and clunky. The animations are clumsy, slow, and will get the player killed if they rely on fast reactions. Foresight is crucial, and adds to the experience. I give the core gameplay a biased 8/10 due to the fact that I endured the awful long enough to reach the awesome.\n\nThe editor is easily the selling point of the game. With a built in trigger system that's fairly easy to manipulate (given online resources), it's simple to make complex and fun missions for yourself and your friends to enjoy. I can't express how awesome the editor is. Since rekindling this old flame from my childhood, I have spent the vast majority of my time making missions. The sky's the limit in what can be made. However, it can get tiring working with the immense amount of bugs. Suffice to say, it's very easy to take a bunch of simple tools and create a complex theme park. 10/10\n\nThe most negative aspect of the game is the AI. Holy damn, the AI is ♥♥♥♥ing terrible. To say the AI is bad does not express the sheer ♥♥♥♥♥iness that is the AI. Take the 'I' out of 'AI' and that's what you had. The AI is so stupid that its only saving grace is the fact it has autoaim. If it locks on, you're probably going to die in seconds at an immense distance. The good news is, outsmarting the AI is about as difficult as breathing. Working with the AI is the singlemost obnoxious thing I have ever had to do in a game, and I spent some years on grindy MMOs. It's like pulling teeth getting them to do what you want, but the game isn't playable without them. 3/10\n\nThe graphics are horrible. Absolutely atrocious. Back in 2001, they were actually rather great. There wasn't much on the market that could give this kind of visual experience. However, that was 2001. In today's standards, the graphics are immensely ♥♥♥♥♥♥. To boot, the animations are hilarious. One gets the impression they're fighting alongside a special needs squad. I don't feel it's fair to judge such an old game based on these aspects, so there won't be a subjective number assigned.\n\nAll in all, this game has serious flaws, but if one can ignore the bugs, outdated graphics, idiot AI, and clumsy controls, they are in for one of the best military simulators ever made. It's an amazing experience, and worth $6. I recommend it with a solid 7/10.","November 16, 2014","true","219.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I downloaded the game and hopped in. Boy this game surprised me.\n\nThis game is an open world squad based military shooter. Sounds awesome right? Beacuse it is! Fighting across massive islands in tense firefights struggling to survive to see the next tense firefight is a lot of fun. This game is also NOT I repeat NOT for you that like casual shooters. 1-3 bullets can kill you. 1 from a headshot if you get unlucky. This game is NOT for casuals. When I first started playing I got frustated at the amount of times I was dying, which was an absurd amount. You HAVE TO play smart, and make every bullet count. There is very little room for error. The combat for me took getting used to, there is a learning curve. The NPCS are also surprisingly smart when it comes to combat. They take cover, launch grenades, take out veichles like its a priority, and are scarily accurate.\n\nPerhaps the greatest thing about the game is the level editor. You can select from 5 massive islands to create your own battles. You can place different factions down, set patrols, waypoints, objectives, ranks, behaviour, etc. Making massive battles to take place in is very fun. I have been screwing around for hours just making large battles, its fun to see so many tanks fight at once :) . The level editor does take learning and the internet to know how to use. There is no tutorial for it. And when it comes to waypoints its gets a little tricky.. And NEVER try to make a tank or any veichle cross a bridge via a waypoint. Its painful to watch.\n\nPros\n-Tense, stressful, rewarding combat.\n-Large, fun battles\n-Level editor is a beast\n-Massive maps to fight on\n- As long as you keep coming up with new ideas, Level editor will keep you entertained for a long time.\n- Impressive NPC to fight against.

In fact, I took a screenshot while looking at the sky in-game and compared it to a high-resolution image of the atmosphere taken by NASA and could spot no differences between them. In fact, I sent a side by side comparison of the two to NASA and they couldn't tell which was the fake and which was real! I mean, for a game made in 2001, that is impressive. I'm pretty sure this goes without saying, but this game runs twice as well as newer games such as Batllefield 4 and Call of Duty: Ghosts, while including twice the content. Again, the degree to which the developers went with this game to reach this gem of a first-person-shooter is simply mind-boggling. Never before has the gaming industry seen a game with audio and models in game that are nearly indistinguishable from people and noises in real life.

I downloaded the game and hopped in. Boy this game surprised me.\n\nThis game is an open world squad based military shooter. Sounds awesome right? Beacuse it is! Fighting across massive islands in tense firefights struggling to survive to see the next tense firefight is a lot of fun. This game is also NOT I repeat NOT for you that like casual shooters. 1-3 bullets can kill you. 1 from a headshot if you get unlucky. This game is NOT for casuals. When I first started playing I got frustated at the amount of times I was dying, which was an absurd amount. You HAVE TO play smart, and make every bullet count. There is very little room for error. The combat for me took getting used to, there is a learning curve. The NPCS are also surprisingly smart when it comes to combat. They take cover, launch grenades, take out veichles like its a priority, and are scarily accurate.\n\nPerhaps the greatest thing about the game is the level editor. You can select from 5 massive islands to create your own battles. You can place different factions down, set patrols, waypoints, objectives, ranks, behaviour, etc. Making massive battles to take place in is very fun. I have been screwing around for hours just making large battles, its fun to see so many tanks fight at once :) . The level editor does take learning and the internet to know how to use. There is no tutorial for it. And when it comes to waypoints its gets a little tricky.. And NEVER try to make a tank or any veichle cross a bridge via a waypoint. Its painful to watch.\n\nPros\n-Tense, stressful, rewarding combat.\n-Large, fun battles\n-Level editor is a beast\n-Massive maps to fight on\n- As long as you keep coming up with new ideas, Level editor will keep you entertained for a long time.\n- Impressive NPC to fight against. Definetly gives you a challenge.\n- Lots of variety in combat. Foot soldiers alone have lots of different classes.\n\nCons\n- The NPCS dont have the best pathfinding\n- Learning curve\n- Dated graphics (Graphics to me personaly dont matter though)\n- Boring campaign in my opinion\n\nOverall I would give this game a 9.5/10. This game is very impressive and fun. You may experience some annoying glitches with pathfinding and such and it is a bit dated, but it hardly subtracts from the overall experience. Definetly a fantastic game for you that like a challenge in a military game.\n\n\n","August 11, 2014","true","37.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For those who want a concise military shooter with consequences if you don't find cover, you've come to the right place. Players are given one save per mission, and the open world approach makes the ideal path to victory very unclear. So long as you don't die, you can at least finish a mission (even if it's an utter disaster). This puts stress on the player to complete objectives as well as survive. Due to the liberties given to the player, I give the campaign an honest 7/10.\n\nThe core gameplay itself will be harder to review because of how much it hits and misses. I'll start with the positive. The shooting is fun. You can either do this from third person, first person, or from ironsights. Each perspective gives the player distinct advantages that the others don't give. There's also the feel of the vehicles. They are easy to control, and very fun once mastery of the controls is attained. It doesn't matter if you're in a chopper, a tank, or a jeep; I have never had so much fun driving a vehicle in a game before. However, that's not the full story. The controls are awkward and clunky. The animations are clumsy, slow, and will get the player killed if they rely on fast reactions. Foresight is crucial, and adds to the experience. I give the core gameplay a biased 8/10 due to the fact that I endured the awful long enough to reach the awesome.\n\nThe editor is easily the selling point of the game. With a built in trigger system that's fairly easy to manipulate (given online resources), it's simple to make complex and fun missions for yourself and your friends to enjoy. I can't express how awesome the editor is. Since rekindling this old flame from my childhood, I have spent the vast majority of my time making missions. The sky's the limit in what can be made. However, it can get tiring working with the immense amount of bugs. Suffice to say, it's very easy to take a bunch of simple tools and create a complex theme park. 10/10\n\nThe most negative aspect of the game is the AI. Holy damn, the AI is ♥♥♥♥ing terrible. To say the AI is bad does not express the sheer ♥♥♥♥♥iness that is the AI. Take the 'I' out of 'AI' and that's what you had. The AI is so stupid that its only saving grace is the fact it has autoaim. If it locks on, you're probably going to die in seconds at an immense distance. The good news is, outsmarting the AI is about as difficult as breathing. Working with the AI is the singlemost obnoxious thing I have ever had to do in a game, and I spent some years on grindy MMOs. It's like pulling teeth getting them to do what you want, but the game isn't playable without them. 3/10\n\nThe graphics are horrible. Absolutely atrocious. Back in 2001, they were actually rather great. There wasn't much on the market that could give this kind of visual experience. However, that was 2001. In today's standards, the graphics are immensely ♥♥♥♥♥♥. To boot, the animations are hilarious. One gets the impression they're fighting alongside a special needs squad. I don't feel it's fair to judge such an old game based on these aspects, so there won't be a subjective number assigned.\n\nAll in all, this game has serious flaws, but if one can ignore the bugs, outdated graphics, idiot AI, and clumsy controls, they are in for one of the best military simulators ever made. It's an amazing experience, and worth $6. I recommend it with a solid 7/10.","November 16, 2014","true","219.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

It hasn't aged that well and the voice acting is quite wonky but it has an excellent campaign which is the main reason why I picked it up. It's more of a thinking man's shooter, and after a few missions you'll be put in charge of a squad which you can order around. I was really surprised at how well the squad mechanics worked, it's not just a worthless gimmick. It was quite fun playing this game in contrast to ArmA 3 and seeing how the series got started and has evolved. Unlike the ArmA 3 campaign this one featured a greater variety of missions, there's stealth missions, tank missions, heli missions, even one where you fly the A-10. While the outdated graphics place a lot of limits on how large scale the battles are, the game still has pretty good draw distance for its time which makes tank battles really feel like tank missions (after the first tank mission I hated them, by the last tank mission I loved them). If you're a fan of Cold War stuff there is a lot in here, you'll be running from BMPs loaded with Soviet troops, supported by HINDs and T80s rolling around destroying everything while the SHILKA denies friendly air support. This is all accompanied by a great original soundtrack which I feel was a little hampered by the poorly chosen licensed music. The difficulty picked up significantly during the last few missions (I actually had to resort GameFaqs, something I haven't done in a while) but overall the game is very playable aside from a couple crashes and bugs. So in conclusion it's not perfect, but still a great tactical Cold War shooter that's worth picking up for free.\n\nFavorite quote (something you should get used to hearing):\n\n"Fall back into formation."\n. . .\n"WHERE ARE YOU?!?"","May 15, 2014","true","18.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

It looks terrible, but it is playable and I found it more enjoyable than ArmA 2. To make things better, this game is also much cheaper than ArmA 2.

Well first its cheap (I actually even bought it on a sale for 0.79, perfect!). This game has the basic Arma formula, Campaign, Single Player, Multiplayer and even Editing Mode which I love to death and wasted most of my time there. This game has pretty low graphics but considering this game is from 2001 well it doesn't matter. Note* I don't have a full blown out gaming PC as my previous one died so I'm using this 16 year old Laptop which needs a USB Wireless Stick to connect to the Internet, and plays this game just fine. In short this is a very cheap full game, that will play on nearly every computer you pit it against (unless the PC practically has no graphics card or is from '95), not to mention its not even a Gigabyte in size, you don't require GB's of memory and RAM, so its relatively small as well! All in all I think its a good deal for quick fun, especially if you don't have an up-to-date PC and have to rely on older hardware! I gurantee you hours and hours of fun (don't be fooled by my playtime, I've been playing it for much much longer in Offline Mode because of my crappy Laptop). So yes I recommend this if you don't have a good PC.","February 19","true","9.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Yes, it's hard. No, it's not CoD, where you can get shot ten times and come out smiling. You will die a lot in this game. But what do you expect, when it's made by people who build military simulators? The difficulty of this game as compared to other first-person shooters only makes the success of a mission that much sweeter. Or, you could be like me and, after completing the objectives for a mission, go off and annihilate everything that moves on the island. Either way, victory is sweet. There is a great variety of weapons and "classes". The mission editor, once you learn how to use it, ensures that all content in the game is at your fingertips. Dogfights between A-10 and SU-25? Done. Tank battles between Shilkas and Vulcans? Easy. The possibilities are limitless! Last but not least, the vehicular warfare is the best I have ever seen in a video game. Nothing beats the thrill of laying down heavy fire on helpless tank/infantry columns in an Mi-24 Hind.\n10/10","September 2, 2015","true","178.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This was the original Arma, and it still holds up for those who just like story-driven Military Simulators. Both campaigns will take you threw some intense moments, not exactly 'exploding' battlefields, but the action can get hot.\n\nOFP Was very innovative in its day, I remember playing it ever since it's demo was released. Countless hours of fun, an actual gazzilion addons are still all over the internet for it as well, including entire custom campaigns and maps, vietnam assets are also avialable.\n\nMostly the reason I'd recommend this is for the story driven campaigns at this point, they're still very good and quite cinimatic, the only reason I dislike this edition is because it lacks the 'Red Hammer' Expansion, which was not stand alone and told the story (few?) Russian soldiers as a prequel and tie-in to the original main campaign- It was also a very good expansion, though had a lot of random acts of violance.","April 25","true","6.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Instead of doing a review in progress.\n\nEarly stage of the game, lots of pointless moving from point A to B. Can't tell friend from foe and can't see where the enemy is, especially near night time, but somehow your AI can tell where they are and their AI can tell where you are. Daytime, I actually seeing and killing the enemy, but my squad is still able to kill them before I see them or they get themselves wipeout and I just run to an objective point. To elaborate why I consider how the missions are setup to be a waste of time. One mission defend installation. Could be a glitch but only one enemy showed up. Waste of time. Some mission in one form or another. Go from point A to point B. Die at point B. Waste time moving to point B again. Die. Repeat a few times before decide to use up my only save slightly before point B. Skirmish from point B to C. Waste time moving to point D. Seems like people equate repeating the same tedious moventment as the price of failure somehow makes this a good game. Half way through the campaign you get to choose your gear and control your squad. If I had the sniper rifle at the beginning of the game, i'm pretty sure i could of Ramboed my way across the map. Really the AI isn't that good, the only thing is you have to kill them before they notice your presence since they are very accurate once they know you're there. Otherwise they are very clueless. Either I could be prone in plain sight about 50m away and they don't react or I kill a bunch of their comrades but they don't seem to notice. Really only 2 or 3 missions were hard fun. A good chunk were just tedious. Since some of the positive reviews haven't put much game time in recently, I'm thinking nostalgia is factoring into their opinion, though I can see why it was GOTY in 2001. Of course, the graphics sucks but it's a 2001 game not a 2011 game. Wish steam would put when the game was originally released not digitally released. Playing on a xp computer game works fine.","February 17, 2015","false","39.7"," 1 of 12 people (8%) found this review helpful","8","1","12","0","3"

We all love intricate games that let you control various things, but it is more time spent looking for the right button and trying to figure out how to perform the simplest of tasks that are compounded by going through 4 different mini-menus on the screen.  I really don't care about graphics, but the game plays smooth, I will give it that.\n\nAs for the single player, I'm stuck following a yellow square for the objective, but it feels as if the game drags me around on a leash instead of the clear plan they present at the beginning of the mission. For one that is go south, then go north-west... it turns into go south, then make 50 course-corrections only to be told to turn around and follow the leader and wherever he decides to turn while still fumbling at controls to tell each person what direction to properly stand it seems.\n\nI really was hoping for a great experience as I hear so much hype about Arma, but this just seems like a game where they tried to cram too many interaction controls into too many menus, for concept I give it an 8/10.... but overall layout and execution sorry but it's dropped way down to a 2/10.","May 17, 2014","false","0.7"," 1 of 12 people (8%) found this review helpful","8","1","12","0","0"

The graphics are very polygon-heavy, the levels are often too open and undetailed, the difficulty is too easy, and the simplicity of the gameplay strips the meat off the metaphorical bones (You only have a M16 for most of the campaign and you can't drive any vehicles unless it's required for the mission at hand) But I digress...\n\nI personally rate Arma Cold War a B- . It's not a bad game, especially for one that Bohemia gave us for free during the 15th Anniversary Sale, but comparred to it's successors it feels like one big demo. For a true-blue military simulator experience, buy Arma 2 instead, and if your system is REALLY beefed up, punch it up a notch with Arma 3.\n","May 19, 2014","false","3.4"," 1 of 12 people (8%) found this review helpful","8","1","12","0","0"

But because of it's lack of multiplayer servers and outdated graphics, it seems impractical to purchase this specific game. I recomend you try the original ARMA or ARMA II. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad game. But it just doesn't bring anything new or worthwhile to the table except for the Cold War theme. If you're in to pre-made scenarios and mediocre single player military simulations, go for it. But like I said, I would go for one of the newer games, or at least one that is multiplayer.","July 2, 2014","false","35.3"," 1 of 12 people (8%) found this review helpful","8","1","12","0","0"

Despite the graphics looking like they where created on Windows 95, I decided that I should give this game a whirl since I got it on a free weekend. I launched it today for the first time, and used the fullscreen mode. I was using Steam Big Picture Mode to launch it, and it broke my gaming rig where it tried to draw windows over the screen and wouldn't accept cursor clicks in the game, but instead on my other windows. Thinking I hit a bug, I tried again in Windowed Mode. BIG MISTAKE. I tried this 3 times, as the cursor wouldn't sync, but instead have 1 cursor outside of the window, which sat upon the top left of my screen with no border to move it, and another cursor in game that was flying around like it was on a ton of sugar. I finally got full screen mode to work after numerus tries, and the cursor flew like I have never seen before. It was extreamly hard to get the the mouse sensitivity page like this, and when I finally did and set it lower, the cursor would lock in place constantly, only going on 1 axis (Mostly the x-axis). By this point I had reached my limit trying to play this crap. This isn't something that should be paid for, or even free. Honestly, I am disappointed that something like this would come out of a company such as this one. For anyone wondering, here are my specs just to be clear that it was not me:\n\nOS (Operating System): Windows 7 Ultimate Edition\nRAM (Random Access Memory): 6 Gigabytes\nProcessor: Intel i7\nMouse: Razor Naga\nKeyboard: Logitech Elite\n\nIn summery, I would not reccomend this game for anyone, and I think it would be better if it where completely removed from Steam altogether, as it's more trouble then it's worth. 1/10","June 24, 2014","false","0.1"," 0 of 10 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","10","0","2"

Despite the graphics looking like they where created on Windows 95, I decided that I should give this game a whirl since I got it on a free weekend. I launched it today for the first time, and used the fullscreen mode. I was using Steam Big Picture Mode to launch it, and it broke my gaming rig where it tried to draw windows over the screen and wouldn't accept cursor clicks in the game, but instead on my other windows. Thinking I hit a bug, I tried again in Windowed Mode. BIG MISTAKE. I tried this 3 times, as the cursor wouldn't sync, but instead have 1 cursor outside of the window, which sat upon the top left of my screen with no border to move it, and another cursor in game that was flying around like it was on a ton of sugar. I finally got full screen mode to work after numerus tries, and the cursor flew like I have never seen before. It was extreamly hard to get the the mouse sensitivity page like this, and when I finally did and set it lower, the cursor would lock in place constantly, only going on 1 axis (Mostly the x-axis). By this point I had reached my limit trying to play this crap. This isn't something that should be paid for, or even free. Honestly, I am disappointed that something like this would come out of a company such as this one. For anyone wondering, here are my specs just to be clear that it was not me:\n\nOS (Operating System): Windows 7 Ultimate Edition\nRAM (Random Access Memory): 6 Gigabytes\nProcessor: Intel i7\nMouse: Razor Naga\nKeyboard: Logitech Elite\n\nIn summery, I would not reccomend this game for anyone, and I think it would be better if it where completely removed from Steam altogether, as it's more trouble then it's worth. 1/10","June 24, 2014","false","0.1"," 0 of 10 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","10","0","2"

I'm glad I got this game for free, because I would have absolutely regretted paying any amount of money for it.

Basically what I'm going to say is that this will be based on my first impressions on this title and to me being exposed to the ARMA franchise in general. After playing the campaign mode for a few hours, I got bored and had more fun team killing my own AI squad members than actually playing the game simply because of how restrictive I felt performing these missions and add the fact that I was walking around 90% of the time with nothing to shoot at. I'm pretty sure you can run off from your squad and do something else, but even if that was possible, the level still feels barren with very little encounters. Of course, what else am I expecting off of this, it's a modern military shooter so of course the entire point of the game is to do objectives while trying to avoid firefights as much as possible. Story-wise, it's not very interesting with the game being set in during the Cold War with the main objective is, you guessed it, kill the Russians, simple as that. The controls at first feels very awkward, but that can always be fixed by rebinding your keys to something you would feel comfortable playing with. Personally the other modes like multiplayer and custom missions are more fun to play because you obviously have more freedom for you to play around. If I were to come back to this, I would just play around with the custom missions, but thats about it. I simply cannot recommend this game just for my own disliking of modern military shooters, but if you are a hardcore ARMA fan, then go right ahead and buy this. It has everything you would expect from an ARMA game.","June 18, 2014","false","1.7"," 4 of 19 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","4","19","0","0"

The mouse is subject to alot of acceleration and locks to the vertical and horizontal axis. I am also unable to launch the advanced options and must manualy go into the game directory and launch the .exe to do so.\n\nannother issue is that many menu options actually lag and put strain on the performance as they are changed (of corse the high they are set the more lag so you have to do so gradually). In game the assets are slow to load and unload when the player has their back turned to them, this causes your performance to drop when turning around as it needs to reload every last asset and unload what was previously infront. This game also lacks any sort of tutorial which normally, would not be a problem is the mouse intergation on the menus wasn't so bad.\n\nI stongly suggest never touching this even though at the current moment of writing this it is free, it would be a massive waste of data.\n","May 16, 2014","false","0.6"," 5 of 22 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","5","22","0","1"

Game was Gold back when it came out and while not the first game to offer aiming down the sights, it was one of the first well known games to have such.\n\nWhen i first played the demo back in the early 2000 time frame, concluding a mission with a Blackhawk that flew to you and landed in real time, climbing on board and watching the landscape slip away below you = Mind Blown!   The only game that could touch it was the original Ghost Recon which i also loved very much, but OFP had no invisible walls and drivable vehicles that allowed for freedom of movement that had'nt really been done before in a FPS.  Games such as Far Cry, Crysis, Call of Duty, Halo, and many more owe this game homage in some aspect.  Its too bad Ghost Recon went in the reverse direction and became more linear.\n\nWith so many Addons and missions it was easy to waste away weeks worth of hours away.","May 17, 2014","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are many problems but all in all it's so worth it.\n\nThe engine and controls are clunky, the graphics are attrocious (understandably) but it doesn't matter because once you get into it it's so immersive.\n\nSo to keep this from dragging on, the gameplay is awesome, it's realistic (as far as a game of this age can go) so one too many shots and you're dead. If you get into an engagment and take hits it's pretty much over, you really need to be the one with the better position or be the one who fires first. This makes tactics extremely important for example positioning yourself, knowing when the move when to stay put, when to fire and when to hold. It could all mean the difference between them getting a few shots off and that'll spell you're end.\n\nAnd the missions are extremely varied, the story is naf but the missions range from 1-3 men late at night blowing up an entire base (stealth and tactical). Mass infantry+armor operations to attack towns and villages. Helicopter transport/attack etc missions. Tank crew missions (which are awesome fun but take time to get good at) and even more than this. It's seriously awesome.\n\nSo i would no doubt recommend this game, it's incredible and I still have fun playing it this long after it was made. The one draw back i should point out is the checkpoint system as you can only save once per mission which means you take 10 minutes longer to do anything which some poeple (including myself) like. However if you dispise this feature and wish to be a little more reckless i will give you this hint/cheat for reading all the way to the end. Go onto the pause menu at any point in a mission and click "shift" and "-" at the same time then type "savegame". You're welcome. :)","September 30, 2014","true","51.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
