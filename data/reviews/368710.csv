There are colored obstacles that must be cleared by the correct pusher, and some require working together. This working together is the twist, and it's toughness showed just a few levels in when I was temporarily stuck in a position where the pushers would block themselves, and it required a small moment of inspiration to find a solution. Even earlier, I had to redo levels, since the mirror mechanic makes it difficult to move both avatars up to the same wall - and since I had destroyed the only aid I had for achieving this, I'd effectively gotten myself stuck. So it's challenging but fair, and requires quite a bit of thinking ahead.\n\nThe fact that the game is low-budget show itself in its low-budget look and some other annoyances. - I have to mention here that my previous review was negative because I was very annoyed with the fact that the exits were only revealed once you had basically solved the level; and having unbeknownst blocked the exit square earlier meant redoing the whole level. The developer took my criticism to heart and made it so that pressing Q now shows the exits, which makes the puzzles fair. Thank you! - I'd love to see fixes for the rest of my annoyances (did the characters gain some speed, or have I gotten used to it?), but for now they're acceptable: game runs with desktop resolution and (partially) cuts off the status bar on the left at 3:4 or 4:5 resolutions; controls are keyboard only and not reassignable; you can switch which character you "control", but there's no visual indication (maybe a glow or something?); and this game would really profit from multi-level undo.\n\nThe game may not look like much, but the puzzles are fair, tax my brain, and I can't remember having seen this mechanic before.

I highly recommend that you give this little game a try especially if you are a puzzle game enthusiast. Well worth the money, regular or sale price.","April 21","true","0.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"
