It's a pretty cool concept and a nice brain exercise for puzzle lovers (not to mention addictive as hell). One big issue, though, is that transition sequences have blindingly bright, totally unnecessary flashing light animations. I have to play this game with my monitor on the lowest brightness setting--otherwise it gives me a migraine.","December 15, 2013","true","14.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

If you aren't...find a better version. This is a 3d puzzle in which colored pieces drop onto the field while you spin the field so the pieces land on a group of like colored spheres, which will then explode. Detonate a group surrounding another colored piece, and that piece will explode upward and then drop, burning away like colored spheres, and possibly causing more explosions. Quantz's one unique feature is that your pieces are mostly free moving. Shake the field and the pieces move. Shake hard, and everything goes flying, before resettling into a (hopefully) better position. For a puzzle game, Quantz is pretty easy. The only time I've ever failed a stage was I tried to do something fancy, and ignored my timer.","September 5, 2012","false","3.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ratv15/recommended/37800/","ratv15","Aufrichtigkeit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ratv15/","159 products in account","playing this game involves slinging slightly magnetic balls around a cube that you rotate with your mouse.  Mastering this game involves being able to do this with dozens of balls at once and then collecting them on different sides of the cube, with the early catches flopping around and falling off as you rotate to catch the later ones.  All with a time limit.\n\nMost painful, awkward controls I've probably ever played.","November 28, 2013","false","12.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

It's cool, it's stlylized, it's not very challenging and after the fun wears off, it's pretty tedious (as all games).
