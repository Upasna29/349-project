Game Characters are also simple shapes with different colours but are easily identifiable. Background colours and effects have a different pallet for each level. The overall effect is minimalist, stylish and elegant.        Audio    10    Relaxing ambient background music throughout the game and excellent story narration by Danny Wallace (He won a BAFTA for his performance). There really is nothing to fault here.       Gameplay    9    Thomas was alone has simple and intuitive controls that respond well, giving good control of your characters. Levels start simply and get progressively more difficult at a fairly steady rate. I don't ever recall feeling overwhelmed at any point and play remained very enjoyable throughout the game. As you progress the game does a good job of introducing you to new concepts that you need to complete the levels like controlling various elements (doors, gravity, etc) through various pressure and trigger switches. Also as you progress you meet and gain control of other characters (besides Thomas) each of which have their own unique properties and abilities. You will often find that you will need to employ skill & logic as well as a bit of trial and error to successful navigate levels but fortunately the game does not punish you for failing, so play always seems fun.        Story    9    I really didn't expect any kind of story from a puzzle platform game, especially not one where the characters are just little shapes, but despite this what I got was a brilliant one. A delightful little story that builds with each level and makes you really care about what happens to your little shapes. Each one has their own unique characters, fears, desires and personalities. Their struggles to survive and escape the unfair system that imprisons them and which is constantly changing the rules in its efforts to defeat them.        Replayability    6    By the end of the game you will have mastered some pretty advanced skills and will remember many of the puzzles solutions, this makes some of the earlier levels feel very easy. The game is of a fairly good length but because its so enjoyable you will no doubt be left wanting more. There are various steam achievements (small black hollow rectangles) scattered throughout various levels and going back to find these will add to the playtime. Levels are re-playable after you have completed them making it a good game for quick casual play.        Overall    8.5    A little gem of an indie game, charming and enjoyable, it leaves you wanting more - would highly recommend.\nMore reviews by Fancy Fish\nAgree / Disagree?

It features some good puzzles based around your team of AI working together to overcome the obstacles before them, each with their own unique ability and personality (which really shines through, despite being simple shapes, thanks to the narration work of Danny Wallace and some good writing).\n\nWhile a little on the short side, it does manage to stay focused without any padding - although I would have liked the game to have continued for a bit longer with escalating difficulty. The game is quite slow paced with a soothing soundtrack which compliments the minimalist style and produces a rather relaxing experience which is topped off with decent controls that never caused frustration.\n\nWhile easily recommended for fans of slower paced 2D platformers and those people who like a well written story, the length of the game (and lack of replayabilty) means I'd suggest waiting for a sale.","January 7, 2014","true","3.3"," 97 of 111 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","97","111","0","5"

You see, Thomas is a block. Thomas and all of the other characters he will meet along the way in fact are all blocks. All of the blocks are trapped in a construct of sorts. Learning their individual purposes. Along the way, you will not so much be guided, as instead enchanted by the wonderful narration you will hear throughout each level. Reminiscent of the narration you may hear in Stanely's Parable or Bastion. Not so much to hep you as to instead tell a story. And that is exactly what the narrator in TWA does, and does it well indeed.\n\nThe game may appear to be a platformer, but honestly the platforming takes a back seat to the puzzle structure of the game. Each block has a different ability. Whether it be how the block moves, what the block can do, or the shape of the block, each block when paired with another can overcome different obstacles. One block may act as a floatation device, while another can be a trampoiline of sorts. You can line up blocks to act as stepping stones for other blocks that can not jump high. And so on and so forth. You are able to seamlessly switch between blocks at ease, so the flow of the game is never broken.\n\nThere are quite a few stages, but each seems to be over way too quickly, leaving you wishing they fleshed the game out more, since it really is a fun and unique idea for this genre. Hopefully we get a sequel to this one day, with maybe a little stronger emphasis on the platforming.\n\nVisually, the game is about as simple as you can get in design. Everything is block based. And the colors are simple. The only thing I saw that really stood out was the nice use of lighting and shadows in a 2D world.\n\n\nPros\n- Fun puzzle elements\n- Fantastic narration of the game\n\nCons\n- Short game\n- Platforming is easy","November 25, 2013","true","3.5"," 97 of 114 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","97","114","0","0"

However, in the digital world, Thomas learns to feel and express himself, attempting to learn more about the world and his inner-conflicts and importance. Along his journey, he meets up with other shapes each with a unique ability, such as being able to double jump (Thomas and all the others can only single jump), to be used as a springboard, or to swim (which the others cannot). These shapes are a few of many characters that exist in Thomas Was Alone. Each shape has a unique personality that is conveyed by the narration throughout the game. In addition, each shape Thomas encounters is also controllable by the person playing the game, which creates the need for teamwork and strategy.\n\nAt first, the shapes think too highly of themselves to feel the need to cooperate with the others. They soon figure out that they can escape to the real world, become architects, and change the virtual world they inhabit, for the betterment of all shapes. This creates a common goal that they work toward as a team instead of as individuals. To make progress, they need each other's unique abilities.\n\nThomas Was Alone is a game that teaches fundamental lessons about life. We all are a part of a bigger picture and we must coexist and cooperate to make any sort of advancement.  We all need to learn how to overcome obstacles to cooperation. We all need to learn the meaning of true friendship while discovering our true selves and our unique talents. These themes reverberate throughout the game, or should I say, work of art.\n\nFinal Ratings*I wrote a review back in 2013 (When I completed the game) but felt Thomas Was Alone could use some more justice so I constructed an updated review.*\n\nGameplay: 10/10 - Never was bored, played it all in one playthrough, loved the soundtrack and narration.\n\nStoryline: 10/10+ My favorite Indie game of all time. This story speaks more than most games can.\n\nCombat: N/A\n\nScary? Nope.\n\nPop-Ups: None.\n\nGraphics: Not even worth rating. The story trumps the graphics in this case.\n\n100% Achievements: Easy.\n\nSingleplayer: 10/10 - It was so superb I played through it all in one sitting.\n\nReplayability: 10/10 - I will definitely revist and play through Thomas Was Alone again.\n\nMultiplayer: N/A - No multiplayer needed to admire this wonderful game.","July 27, 2015","true","5.4"," 56 of 63 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","56","63","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/220780/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Yes this is a game about squares and rectangles, but it's also so much more than that. The heart and soul of Thomas Was Alone is its story of friendship, learning to believe in yourself, and never settling for just OK. Groan worthy as that may sound, developer and writer Mike Bithell deftly avoids the pretentious and heavy handed pitfalls that have proven to be so easy to fall into, and manages to craft a narrative that is touching, funny, and unquestionably charming from start to finish.\n\nEqual if not greater credit for this also has to go to Danny Wallace for his spot on voice acting which includes a liberal amount of British wit, that brought to life these quadrilateral characters in a way that despite being a tired phrase, can only be described as a triumph! When the end came after just over two hours, I was saddened not because I felt unsatisfied or that it was too short, but merely wanted to spend more time with these characters I had so quickly come to love.\n\nEven if forgoing the story, TWA is still a very clever puzzle platformer that near perfectly balances the difficulty to rarely be frustrating but always satisfying. The levels have been thoughtfully planned without any filler to speak of, which made for no obvious stopping points and instead keep the adventure rolling. What I feel is most remarkable though is how ingeniously gameplay is blended with story, building upon each other and proving impossible to separate without sacrificing what makes the various components so great. This to me is what defines a great videogame story; something that couldn't be achieved the same way in any other medium and was built with this understanding in mind.\n\nUnlike the dozens of simplistic flash games that use similarly primitive shapes as placeholders or out of sheer laziness, here much care has been put into each block and area to make them both unique and memorable, result is not the least bit unpleasant to look at. From the subtle jump animations to the impressive lighting, upon further inspection TWA is much more detailed than it first appears, and with the engrossing soundtrack the presentation across the board is simply a treat.\n\nI'm sure if I tried I could find something to nitpick about, but there's no need for me to as that is all it would be. I absolutely loved every moment of Thomas Was Alone, and you would be hard pressed to stop me from recommending to almost everyone. Mike Bithell did a cracking fine job in every regard, and I'm ever so thankful he was able and willing to share it with me. Now I hope to do the same and that this prompts you to take a moment if you haven't to meet Thomas, who as it turns out was most certainly not alone.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","October 19, 2013","true","3.3"," 60 of 70 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","60","70","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/220780/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Thomas Was Alone is a puzzle platformer that shows off how good platforming games can be in the present day. You start out the game playing Thomas, a red rectangle, and as you progress through the stages you will meet many different characters, which you can also play. These different characters all have names and their own special ability that makes them all an integral part of the game.\n\nThe story of Thomas Was Alone is told by a narrator, his voice soothes you and this gives the game a lot of feelings. You wouldn't think you would grow any kind of attachment to simple shapes, but you do. The narration can be quite funny at times, and the fourth wall is often broken on several occasions.\n\nI really like the art style in TOA, it's simple, yet it has that really polished feel to it. Like with most platformers, it's not exactly graphically intensive, but it still represents a pretty looking game.\n\nEach level consist of a number of puzzles and jumping challenges to make, you have to make use of all the characters in each stage in order to progress, and often in some levels, there are more than one way to complete them, leaving you room to experiment with different methods. The difficulty of Thomas Was Alone is quite high once you reach the half way point, often at times I had to revert to a FAQ in order to figure out how to progress.\n\nI finished Thomas Was Alone in seven hours, which is quite long for a platformer; there are also additional challenges, which involve getting to difficult to reach places that will let you squeeze a little bit out of replay-ability the game. Unfortunately though, once you've had one play through, there's not much else to see and you won't need to boot it up again.\n\nMy conclusion is that Thomas Was Alone must be in your library as it's one of, if not the best platforming experience you will have\n\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Everything is a block or cubes, straight out of what would look like Atari, but with modern improvements so you don't notice the lack of textures. Things like lighting, good simple, yet dynamic backgrounds and the fact that the level always looks to be at a slight tilt. While it might not stand out visually, the game has good mellow and trippy background music that is just soothing to complete each level. There is also a well voiced narrator that just talks over a few parts of the levels to give the characters life when really, they're just blocks. There is quite a lot of fan art for these 'characters.'\n\nThe controls are really as simple as they can be. So simple, you don't even need a controller. Arrows to move the character, a jump button and buttons to switch to the next or previous character.\n\nIts all nice on the eyes and the ears, the only real problem is this is just tedious. Each character has their own unique style. Some are short and can fit where others cant. Some are tall, some float. You can use characters as stepping stones so they can make it up ledges and this is where the game hits a tedium. Imagine to make it up a ledge, you need to use 2 characters so that the short character can make it up. Then do that 5 times and 5 more times before the end of the level. Sure its not every level, but it really feels dull having to switch between 3 characters, get them in position just to ensure 1 of them gets to his exit. It gets into the realm of being a chore. Sure it doesn't take that long to complete each area, nor is it difficult, but it just feels slow having to use 3 characters to make it the slightest bit further. I don't feel any sense of accomplishment getting to the next level.\n\nTo make up for that though, the game has frequent checkpoints.... especially right before dumb deaths. Deaths that might have 1 character standing on top of a floating character, but when you jump out of the water as the floating character, the character on top flies into a bed of spikes. Well, luckily the game knows this will usually happen, so there's a checkpoint right behind it. Another plus that the game has is instant respawn. It keeps you going like Super Meat Boy. This helps the game a lot.\n\nYou won't find any enemies in Thomas, only friends to aid you... and instant death traps like water and spikes. The game is very straight forward, jump and avoid death traps. Use friends to get to different areas, hit switches to change areas.\n\nThomas is a game full of easy achievements. Maybe an hour for 15 achievements and 2 or 3 hours for the entire game to be complete. There's no real replay value here, the collectables are out in the open and easily obtained.\n\nThere are other platforming puzzle games that are better challenges, that feel less like a chore to complete. However, because of the music, narrator and the simplicity, it is a very soothing stress reliever to play.","July 10, 2013","true","5.6"," 28 of 34 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","28","34","0","0"

It has a lot of nicely prepared levels with tons of smart ideas.\n\nNot too hard, not too easy - level design is perfectly balanced.\nI got it from bundle of course, just like most of indie games nowadays (which starts to be "pain-in-the-a*s"), but i\nwouldn't hesitate to spend £6 on it.\n\nMy rating: 8/10\n\np.s.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ErickaUnlimited/recommended/220780/","ErickaUnlimited","💝💝ErickaUnlimited💝💝","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ErickaUnlimited/","777 products in account","Overview\nThomas Was Alone is a thought-provoking puzzle platformer created from the mind of Mike Bithel. The game originally started as a flash game back in 2010, before slowly making its way to Steam and  console systems a few years later.  As the player, you control Thomas-AT-23-6-12, or Thomas for short, an artificial polygon that has taken on a form of free thinking and is now questioning the world around him. As you progress the levels, you'll encounter and control several other characters, each with their own shape, narrated personality and unique ability to help you guide your way to the end of each level.\n\nThe story takes place within a computer mainframe that is run by a company known as "Artificial Life Solutions". Due to a glitch in the mainframe or some other unknown error, several of the polygon AI have become suddenly self-aware and see the computer mainframe as the world in which they live. Each newly aware shape takes on a different personality: some more eager than the rest, one a little more scared than the others, while one is just worried about being used for her ability and another just wants to be a superhero.  While every character is narrated by a single person (Danny Wallace), each personality is as different as the shapes they come in; Mr. Wallace does a phenomenal job.\n\nEach shape's ability needs to be used to some degree to reach the end of the level: some jump higher than others, some float in water, some are tall, some are small, some defy gravity...etc. It is your job to guide these guys to the end. As you progress the story, you'll meet a new cast of characters, new puzzles to solve and more about the world Thomas and gang live in. There's a bit more to the story than first impressions realize and it's an intriguing story to flesh out over the course of the game. In total, there are ten segments of the game to play through, each with ten levels per segment.\n\nThe difficulty of Thomas Was Alone consists of a very fine, gradual learning curve. The game does not suffer from issues of spiking difficulties or unfair level design, which gives the game a very mellow tone alongside the pleasant narration, making it a fun experience, not a frustrating one. I'm not the greatest platformer around, so if I can do it, you can too. ^_-\n\nIn the end, Thomas Was Alone is a light-hearted joy to experience. I'd dive more into the plot, but I don't  want give away spoilers for those that have yet to play the game and have been lucky enough to not spoil it for themselves. You'll have to find out what has happened to Thomas and his friends, how have they become sentient, what are the "shifters", what's the pixel cloud about and who are the "Architects?\n\nThere's always something a game can improve on, but I feel hard-pressed to pinpoint what exactly I would change about this one. The positives truly do outshine any issues I did experience while playing it.\n\n\nPros\nNarration - It's beautiful, it's calm and it's intriguing. I don't know how else to say it. I loved it.\nCharacter development - This is by and large the only game I've played that made me feel physical emotion towards geometric shapes. I genuinely developed feelings for them.\nIt's an easy game to complete for those who like to achievement hunt.\nDifficulty - It felt very fluid throughout and never suffered from spikes or drops in difficulty at unforeseen times.\nCons\nGame length - It's short and leaves me wanting more.\n\nOverall, Thomas Was Alone is a gem. I purchased this game on a whim a while ago based on other reviewers and was pleasantly surprised with it. The story is charming, the levels are fun, the characters are unique and interesting (even as colorful shapes that don't speak) and it all flows so seamlessly together. There are very few games I play more than once, especially when I complete them entirely, but Thomas Was Alone is definitely one of them. Check it out if you have not done so already! It's worth the try.","April 19","true","4.2"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","20","23","0","1"

Aesthetically this game employs a nice desaturated but diverse color palette that I like. The use of lights, shadows, and other visual subtleties  are cool too. TWA is a very minimalistic approach to platforming where you traverse the stages by controlling up to 5 different characters each with unique abilities. There's actually a compelling storyline delivered by a witty third person narrator who tells a rather convoluted, yet highly entertaining, story of the humble group of quadrilaterals. Since it's a casual game, the storytelling really helps carry the game along pretty well, It's not too heavy just refreshing to hear in between the stages and queue you to your progression in the game. I rarely felt stuck on any particular task for too long, the game keeps things fresh by briskly moving back and forth though wide variety of skill sets. Its a surprisingly intriguing game for just controlling a bunch of different squares. 8.5 out of 10","August 8, 2013","true","10.3"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","0"

You play as a series of squares or rectangles, each of which has a different colour, a different size, different jumping heights, and some have bonus abilities like double jumping or floating in water. You traverse levels by switching between characters and stacking them up to use their abilities appropriately to get through the levels. When you get to the end, each square has a box they need to be in to go to the next level. There are 100 levels. The pacing is good, there's always new stuff, levels only take a minute or a minute and a half. None of the levels really have any challenge, it's generally immediately apparent what you have to do and there's only really one mechanic that actually presents any challenge in executing what you need to do (one block type has reverse gravity and you have to sort of lasso a falling block on top of a falling upward block so they sort of meet in the middle and float off each other). Some levels have a single collectible.\n\nIt took me apparently 2.9 hours total, but that includes doubling back and getting a few missed collectibles. It's very pretty because it's just made of primitives. The music is really really nice.\n\nI guess the main thing that the game does that's unique is that it has voiceover narration that provides an inner monologue for the blocks, who all have personalities. This is pretty nice, very well written, and cheeky, and it's cool to think of coloured blocks as human-like characters, but ultimately the "plot" is unclear--something about hacking the gibsons to free the information mainframe or whatever--and most of the personalities don't really go anywhere or lead to payoff. One very cool thing is that as the voiceover speaks, there are subtitles that appear next to the character you're playing as... but as you move, the subtitles waterfall so that you always see them on screen... so if you're at the right of the screen you might see the subtitles on one line to the left, but if you run to the left and there's less space, it sort of squishes into five or six lines. It can't really be described, it's like the effect that happens if you resize your browser window horizontally and text wraps, but applied to cool effect.\n\nSo all in all, I'd say it's well worth the 3 hours and cute and I'm looking forward to what the dev does next, but it doesn't really stick with me, even now and it's not super substantial. Mild recommendation.","March 1, 2014","true","2.9"," 32 of 45 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","32","45","0","1"

After actually looking into the game a bit more, I realized it was something that would really interest me. When I finally played it, I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nIf you like an interesting storyline following unique "characters," puzzle platforming requiring lots of planning, and witty narration, then you will like this game.\n\n1The aesthetics are good - although the characters are simple shapes, the coloring and effects in the background are well-done. The music and sound effects are very nice, adding appropriate vibes to complement the pacing and atmosphere of each level. The narration is very good, and offers the backstory for the characters. If you like storytelling, you may be surprised by how attached you get to simple shapes. The story is also well-written, and each level adds a piece to the puzzle that is the main plot.\n\nThe controls are simple and easy to learn, however, mastering the game mechanics can take a while. As you progress through the story, you will meet new shapes - each with their own special ability - and you will have to use each specialty of each shape propely in order to advance to the next level. The learning curve is mostly minimal to moderate - the main difficulty being in how to solve the later puzzles in the game. Later, there are some timing-based puzzles involved. There are usually checkpoints to help you continue on if death in parts of a level is a possibility. I am currently stuck on a level that requires both timing and careful planning = it is the level where Thomas and the green shape must mirror each others paths or else one (or both of them) will "fall" to a bed of spikes and die. It's taking a while mostly because there are no checkpoints and I get impatient if I die before reaching the end portals.\n\nFor achievement hunters, this game has fairly easy achievements (most are progression-based), the hardest ones to acquire being the jump count ones; however, you will most likely get all of them through progression in the game.\n\nThe puzzles are challenging and increase in difficulty at a reasonable, fair pace. You are also (usually) shown basic concepts for what to do in easier levels before you encounter them again in subsequent levels (with more difficult puzzles). So long as you pay attention to how you are solving each puzzle, you should have little trouble solving each stage. Trial and error also helps a great deal.\n\nOverall, the game adds a nice flavor to puzzle platforming, and projects a minimalist, serene feeling while you play. Puzzle enthusiasts should definitely give this one a try.\n\nHighly recommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews","October 5, 2014","true","3.2"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","20","24","0","4"

While it is that, what I found when I began playing is that it is also much more.\n\nBefore I get ahead of myself, let me say a few words about the gameplay. It is a platformer, and most of your actions will be some variation on jumping. Some of the usual mechanics come into play, such as double jumping, reversed gravity, bouncing, and so on. It is also primarily puzzle-focused, so, while there are a couple of places where a moving environmental hazard forces you to act within a certain timeframe, response time is generally not a factor.\n\nThe actual gameplay consists of guiding rectangles of various sizes and proportions, each with different abilities, to designated spots in each level which act as 'portals' to the next level. The puzzles themselves are not mind-numbingly difficult. This is by no means the most difficult game in the world, though I never found it overly simplistic or boring. That may have more to do with the game's most outstanding feature, however.\n\nThe most compelling aspect of the game is the story. The player is treated throughout the game to intermittent voiceovers from the third-person omniscient narrator as he describes the innermost thoughts and feelings of the characters: their hopes, their fears, their attitudes toward and relationships with one another, and so on. The game tells a story of exploration and self-discovery, of love and courage and self-sacrifice. It makes these simple parallelograms far more human than many more anthropomorphic characters from other games.\n\nThis is enhanced by an outstanding soundtrack. The music is subtle and gentle. You hardly notice it's there most of the time, yet it mirrors the tone and mood of the game perfectly.\n\nThe only complaint I have, really, is the length. I finished it in a little over seven hours, and I was distracted and not playing for some of that, so it's maybe five hours of gameplay or so. That said, I'd say it's still well worth it.\n\nIf you're thinking about getting this, or if it seems like something that might interest you, don't hesitate. I think you'll be surprised how much you may come to care about a few simple rectangles.","December 29, 2012","true","7.7"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","5"

There are over 100 levels in this game, but they are all brief. Maybe 1-2 minutes for most of them, and only a handful that require you to stop and plan.\n\nThese brief levels work, though, because they are triggers for narrative dialog of the story. Through narrative these blocks of color are given vivid personalities and character traits.\n\nThis works wonderfully. Voiceman David Wallace delivers a story in a manner that is, in turn, sarcastic, earnest, sad, wry, hopeful, and often very funny.\n\nThomas Was Alone is a smart and engaging must-play indie title.

You begin your story as Thomas. A small, Red AI rectangle and from there you gather a group of freinds, All unique and special in what they can do, Their personality ect.\n\nI may be going a bit off the point with that but it will link into my pros of the game.\n\n\nHere's my overview of the game as a whole:\n\nPros:\n\n+Visuals are simplistic but yet stunning. It's not amazing, Yet not terrible. Somewhere in-between and it sets the mood for the game perfectly how it's presented.\n\n+The puzzles and gameplay are rather smooth. The puzzles are not too difficult and keep you thinking. If something doesn't work, It's a matter of go back and try again or find a specific point and fix it.\n\n+The Soundtrack is amazing. I just love everything about it. It makes a major part of the game. It may be subtle but it's amazingly effective.\n\n+The Characters are relateable and loveable. They all have their own personalitys and traits. You mightn't really go into it too much in the actual game but, It's nice. It also gives the message that everyone has a strength even if they think it's a weakness.\n\n+The messages within the game are cryptic, I cannot even begin to take them apart. Although, I get the overlaying image and that really makes me enjoy the game more. The game doesn't adress these things, But it shows, Overall I enjoyed the spending the time to think of the meaning to things within the game.\n\n+The Narrator isn't boring and keeps things full of energy at the right moments and also he shows emotion very well in accordance to the current situation within the game.\n\n+The Length of the game isn't too long, Not too short. Just the right amount for the story. Very well balanced. You may not finish it in one sitting but, It won't take you more than 2 weeks of split-up gameplay. (Speaking from my experiance.)\n\nCons (Even though there's few and far between):\n\n-Some levels may take what seems to be FOREVER. On top of that, you make a wrong move on some levels and it's back to the start. It may seem stupid, But for some people, This game can actually make you angry at the fact you can't solve a simple puzzle in some cases.\n\n-The game at early points doesn't give you much of a toutorial into different mechanics or how to get past certain areas. This isn't a major con in the game (Nor do I want a toutorial in the game...God that would be awful) but, It does leave the player at some points alot of time to just sit there and try many different things 'till they work. Not a terrible flaw as I said but, It can be quite frustrating.\n\n\nSo, In short: If you like casual, Indie, Puzzle games that make you think, This one is for you. I enjoyed this game alot. It made me come back for a bit more each time. Alot of people play this game only because it's easy to 100% achievments in it but, That's not a valid reason to play this game. Play this game if you want something a bit different but doesn't take you out of your comfort zone too much.\n\nHope you enjoy the game as much as I have. ^^","July 13, 2015","true","5.4"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","12","15","0","0"

And the beautiful narration and soundtrack, just made a wonderful mood which, removes any frustration if you are stuck in a place for awhile, although most levels are easy so as the puzzle elements.\n\nI would recommend this game to everyone, this game is a simple puzzle game yet it had depth, in story and narration, and overall it is an  amazing game! 9/10","March 21, 2014","true","12.5"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","2"

Was. But not for long.\n\nThis short tale is a heart-warming story of equality, acceptance, sacrifice, and above all, friendship. You may think that the characters in this game are simple rectangles, but they are so much more. Each of them forms a strong character as they strive, as one, to their goal.\n\nThey quickly learn to accept their differences; nay, to embrace their differences, using each other’s strengths in order to overcome obstacles and complications which they would never be able to do by themselves, due to their own individual weaknesses and flaws.\n\nHelping them to accomplish their destination, you will be challenged at times, but every time they get one step closer to their collective target will reward you and leave you feeling enthralled.\n\nThe game seems simplistic but it flows fluidly and artistically, accompanied with a charming, witty narrative and a beautiful soundtrack. The result: a game that comes together perfectly, filled with emotion and verve.\n\nWhen I finished the game I found myself wanting to play more of it. Not because it is too short, but because I felt like I had personally connected with each of the characters and I wanted to spend more time getting to know them.\n\nYou will laugh, you will cry, but at the finale you will be captivated by this truly magical experience.","November 23, 2014","true","7.4"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cannonesshannah/recommended/220780/","cannonesshannah","Katie's Hannah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cannonesshannah/","979 products in account","Recommended: There really isn't any reason not to play this.  This is one of the finest examples of the puzzle-platformer genre out there, if not the best, and it earns that status very honestly: high production values, an absolutely stellar narration, and a great puzzle-platform experience.\n\nThe inclusion of Thomas Was Alone in the current Humble Bundle sale has given me a chance to revisit and review a game that's very close to my heart indeed.  If I ever were to make a list of my top ten games of all time or some such contrivance, I have little doubt Thomas Was Alone would be on there.  Highly placed as well, one speculates.\n\nFor those not already acquainted with the game, Thomas Was Alone is a puzzle platformer by independent game developer Mike Bithell.  At the time of its release, it came seemingly out of nowhere, mostly unannounced and without any major backing.  When people discovered it, however, it became something of a phenomenon.  Indeed "something of a phenomenon" doesn't seem to do it justice.  While SteamCharts is no scientific tool, if there is any truth to its numbers at all, Thomas was Alone is among one of the more successful games on Steam.  Coming from a handful of talents and a single developer, that is noteworthy indeed.\n\nThomas Was Alone is a game that leaves a reviewer in something of a quandary.  It's a hard game to review, not because it's difficult to play, it actually hits quite a sweet spot in that regard, challenging the player but not overmuch, nor because it is buggy, because I have gone trying to find bugs and have not had any success.  It's a hard game for someone like me to review because quite frankly, the chief reason to play it is the overarching story delivered by some of the best narration I've heard used in a video game.\n\nStripped of that element, Thomas Was Alone would simply be a quirky, fun little puzzle platformer that you'd play through once or twice and enjoy, and leave it at that.  The narration, delivered in spectacular form by Danny Wallace (of Assassin's Creed fame), presents the story of the game in brilliant form, and if there's one thing that I have heard repeated again and again by critics, gamers, and otherwise those playing the game, be they platformer fans or not, is that they wanted to continue the game just to get that next bit of story, that incremental soundbye glimpse into the world of our quadrilateral protagonists - and antagonists!\n\nIndeed, as some who follow my reviews know, I'm not "big" on platformers.  There's a few I enjoy, but even those ones I was terrible at, because the arthritis I suffer through and deal with on a daily basis makes it a genre that I suffer through.  There's some games that are good to the point I happily suffer them because they're just good games.  Then there's the one, that platformer I wouldn't even say I suffer through, and that is Thomas Was Alone.  The story does that for me, as it does for many others.\n\nWhat Thomas Was Alone does as well, however, is a masterful job at placing the emphasis on the puzzles rather than the platforming.  Platforming in and of itself is well-trodden ground, and there isn't much new to be done with it, I feel, but the puzzles of Thomas Was Alone are where it differentiates itself in that regard.  They're really clever puzzles too - the kind of puzzles that especially towards the end do a very masterful job of being both simple and devious, requiring using the mechanics at hand without them feeling shoe-horned in or otherwise clumsy.  The mechanics evolve with the story, and vice versa, as the tale of our brave little dots unfolds.\n\nAnd just the language I use hints at the powerful narrative been woven with Thomas Was Alone.  The characterisation delivered through that narration is something that sticks with you, both for how well the narration is delivered and the quality of the writing.  How the characters are established doesn't end there though - the design of each of the characters and their corresponding abilities reinforces how they are portrayed.  I have yet to see someone who plays the game that doesn't end up having a favourite.\n\nThomas Was Alone, on so many levels, is a very thoughtful game.  It evokes a lot of emotional response, and it does that out of a careful thought to the design and presentation of the game.  From the music which is melodious and very well-composed, to the narration, to the meticulous way in which every element has been put together, Thomas Was Alone  achieves everything it set out to do - and perhaps much, much more.\n\nAt the end of it all, Thomas Was Alone is the story of dear Thomas.  He was alone, but perhaps you might keep him company a while.\n\nPublished: http://highlandarrow.com/index.php/reviews/90-review-thomas-was-alone","April 25, 2014","true","16.0"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","2"

It is a cute 2D platformer with simplistic graphics and a stunning use of narration and lighting. Now, the main draw for myself was the narration, and at the end of the experience, the narration was the highlight. It is difficult to describe the connections you end up making with each little character as you progress, all due to the clever use of narration. All the characters have distinct personalities, and all of them end up sticking with the player. I eventually even had a favorite character, and all the while I realized how ridiculous it was that this character happened to be a rectangle with a color assigned to it. Each character has its own gimmick. Whether it is jumping high, being able to swim, fit in tight spaces, etc. These gimmicks create the puzzles that make up the entire game. Without them it would be quite bland. They are always exciting, and easy to understand as they are introduced cleverly. Do I recommend it? Yes I do. For those who want a slow-paced, narrative driven puzzler, this game is the best out there. I loved it.

At it's most basic, it is a puzzle/platformer consisting of "get your colored pegs into the proper holes" that invokes memories of classics like The Lost Vikings or Tetris. However, Thomas Was Alone is so much more than meets the eye. By navigating each individual shape through the level, the player can complete a stage by simultaeneously getting each shape to it's destination. A platformer without enemies, collectibles, combat, or even anything more than 90 degree angles and a jump button, Thomas Was Alone manages to enchant the player with a unique narrator who gives life to the various colored squares and in an inescapable way creates a strong attachment between the player and the "characters". It takes place in a computer mainframe, with each of the characters representing a piece of artificial intelligence software that has become self aware. I fell in love with the game and its absolutely phenomenal presentation after just a few levels of play. This is one of those games you don't want to finish, simply because reaching the end will be so heartbreaking. The unvoiced characters (each of which is only a differently colored square with varying properties) have found a permanent home in my heart as some of the richest and most colorful (pardon the pun) characters in any video game I've encountered. The OUTSTANDING music and the background art create an ambiance unlike any other, and the game quickly becomes impossible to put down. I haven't felt like this about a video game since I was a child, and I would gladly buy this game all over again. Mike Bithell has created a masterpiece, and I wish that every true gamer could have a chance to experience it. If there ever was a question as to whether video games can be art, let this be the shining example.\n\nPROS: Highly entertaining, hard to put down, excellent difficulty level\nCONS: Too short, many levels are overtly linear\n\nGRAPHICS: 5/5 - The world is uniquely stylized and the animation is smooth and fluid.\nSOUND: 5/5 - The music, produced by David Housden, is beautiful, and it suits the game perfectly.

The controls are extremely good, and the graphics, while very simple, match with the game's theme and mood.\n\nThe story is told via a narrator who recites both what the characters are saying and thinking, much like listening to an audio novel. The approach works well, and serves to anthromorphize characteristics onto what would otherwise be blank slates.\n\nThe game is short, and relatively easy - it can be beaten in around 3 hours with nothing additional left to see.

There is an interesting little story here and absolutely superb narration by Danny Wallace, but that is really all the game has going for it.\n\nThomas Was Alone is a puzzle platformer that doesn't get either the puzzles or the platforming right. You control a series of blocks and must guide each of them to their specific exit on any given level. Each block has their own unique ability, some allowing for double jumps and others allowing other blocks to bounce off them, but the game never comes up with anything interesting for them to do along the way. The jumps are basic, and the puzzles never amount to much more than "stack a block on top of the other blocks, now jump on that block" and that's basically it. One level had me build six of the same staircases in a row because apparently solving the "puzzle" once wasn't enough. There just aren't any interesting ideas here, not one single clever puzzle in the entire game. It gets so bad whenever narration would start up I'd just stop playing to listen to it, because it was literally the only thing interesting about the entire game.\n\nThomas Was Alone tells a good story and tells it well, but as a game this fails on just about every level. You could watch a friend play it or see someone else play it on YouTube and have exactly the same experience. It isn't worth buying as a "game" because it never really gives you a reason to want to play it. Watch someone else do it instead if you're interested in the story and save your money for something else.","September 2, 2015","false","4.1"," 38 of 70 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","38","70","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/frazr_lzer/recommended/220780/","frazr_lzer","viad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/frazr_lzer/","164 products in account","Thomas Was Alone looks like a basic, minimalist puzzle platformer with shapes at first glance, but it shines through with a well written story with character, a high quality and soothing soundtrack, and gameplay that is fun and simple.\n\nAs a puzzle platformer, the goal of each level is to bring each colored block to a portal by aligning them to the correct outline. To reach the portals, each shape has different abilities to help them get through the levels. In addition, multiple characters tend to appear together in each level, requiring players to use the characters together and help all the shapes out. The puzzle difficulties are not too hard to figure out, and on occasion there are levels needing some reflexes to evade obstacles. As the game continues, more mechanics are given which expand more abilities and level designs to play through and figure out.\n\nBelieve it or not, Thomas Was Alone has a story, and a really good one as well. Basically, these shapes seen in the game are AI, and scattered throughout the game are quotes from humans about the AI and their progression. The game is voiced by a narrator who tells the story, going into the events of the AI, their thoughts, and some humor in as well. The British narrator is one of the strong parts of the game by having a likable voice and interesting lines. In addition to a strong narrator, the AI have distinct personalities and character, which help drive the story. Most people who look at the game at first don't know it has a story or strong characters, but it actually does and makes for an excellent story.\n\nThe art style is composed of simple shapes, giving the game a minimalist flair. However, the game isn't all just flat shapes and colors, as there are finer details thrown in along with shading and other non geometric things in the game to give depth. The art design works well to get the point across and looks sharp and stylized without being hard on the eyes.\n\nThe music is another one of the best parts of the game. The songs use a mix of electronic and traditional instruments for a laid back and soothing experience. In addition, there are some procedurally generated sounds and ambient influences for the soundtrack as a whole. With a blend between electronic and traditional, along with using procedural generation and ambient music, the music is both relaxing and memorable to drive the game and its story forward.\n\nMany people will look at images and some video of Thomas Was Alone and think there isn't much to this minimalist game. The puzzle platformer gameplay is simple, but gets more complex and interesting as the game goes on. Story plays a big role in Thomas Was Alone, as the AI have character to them and the story is explained with an excellent narrator that talks about the events that have happened, thoughts each character has, and some entertaining lines. Lastly, the music is rich with electronic and traditional influences, and makes for a well crafted soundtrack that goes hand in hand with the story. Thomas Was Alone should be given a play even though first impressions may seem otherwise, for it holds a great but simple set of puzzles along with a captivating story and an uplifting soundtrack.","March 20, 2015","true","3.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","1"

The developer really brings life into these shapes, and along with the fantastic soundtrack, this is one game nobody should pass up.","September 10, 2014","true","3.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

If you think you can't care about little featureless rectangles, well, you'd be surprised.\nThis game has an amazing story that touches on the titular loneliness, love, arrogance, having a purpose in life, friendship.\nAnd all of it is told while you jump around with a handful of rectangles.

Also, of more importance, the dialogues are very cleverly satirical chosen - and one will have more than just a laugh :D\nIts really awesome, to see how this rightly executed - can add so immense to the whole product.\n\nThe controls are very fine (keys & 360 controller) - and the game never feels like it has broken control - or is not reacting to your inputs. You always feel in control over your squares.\n\nThe presentation is minimalistic, but still has its special effects (unity engine) - so it fits a 100% to the game (idea).\nI recommend this highly, to everybody who can play a game even/also if it hasnt that AAA looks, especially when you are a hound for indies.

It doesn't matter how high a budget is for a game or how large the development team is, so long as you have a good idea in your head an amazing product is possible, Thomas Was Alone proves that.\n\nThomas Was Alone (in a nutshell) is an Indie platformer where you have to use the unique abilities of each colored shape to overcome obstacles and puzzles. For a game that has such a simple graphics style and very basic gameplay, it has a very compelling and wonderful storyline and atmosphere, and yet even though I don't quite understand the story completely, this game is powerful, it makes you feel for the characters since they go through a ton of character development, even though they're only quadrilaterals... I know, I know, but trust me, this game is worth your time.\n\nThe narration voice acting is very well done and so full of character, this game probably has the best narrative I've ever heard in any game, and not just in the Indie genre. The voiceover tells the story of Thomas Was Alone in a witty, charismatic manner as you play and overcome the obstacles ahead leaving you hungry for more of the dialog as you play through the game.\n\nThere is very little to fault about this game, I do however think that £6.99 is somewhat of a steep price considering there isn't much length to the game, but I still say that this is worth your time and money. If you are an Indie game collector, enjoy platformers or a compelling story/narrative, this is the game for you.","October 1, 2014","true","3.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

You’ve probably never played a game cuter than this.\n\nReview\nDesign:\nThe graphics of this game are extremely simple, yet extra ordinary. The colors and shapes will guide you through the game easily. It’s minimalistic style might be boring for some people, but it is essential for the game and looks very clean. 8/10\n\nMusic & Audio:\nThomas Was Alone features a very fine soundtrack by Davide Housden that catches you within the first seconds.

This game is a great one and has to be in the steam libary of everyone who loves to play unique games. You get a few hours of fun and a nicely told story for just a little amount of cash, so get this game. 8/10\n\nFor the cheap price of 7.99€ you get more than you can ask.

Of different colors. And it’s also really interesting how their personalities are related to their abilities.\n\nChris is short and he can’t jump high, so he has developed sort of an inferiority complex, for example. John is a very tall block that runs fast and jumps really high, and he’s somewhat of an attention ♥♥♥♥♥ and show-off, requiring the audience of other… blocks. And they develop their personalities throughout the game! It’s amazing. And the narration is awesome.\n\nNot to mention that the level and puzzle design is really quite smart, and there are times where it requires a very clever use of said blocks’ abilities. Thomas Was Alone is really short, though. You can beat it in around 3 hours? But it’s a very enjoyable and engaging experience, I really liked the game and would recommend you to check it out.","April 20, 2014","true","3.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you've ever come across any topics of the "are games art" subject, chances are Thomas Was Alone was mentioned.\n\nThe main draw here is the polished presentation and music contrasted with the simple graphics and mostly simple gameplay.  The music is modern "feel-good" toned stuff mixed with minor techno bleeps and bips.  There is a narrator that basically is the bulk of the story, explaining what the characters are feeling and what they're thinking.  You'll go from characters that are perky and lively to the ones that lack self-confidence, all the way to the bashful youth types and the double-crossers.\n\nOf course, the characters here are the Atari / Tetris type blocks.  Each character controls differently, some are quick and able to leap anywhere, others are slow and bulky, others can double jump or act as platforms over dangerous water.  The puzzles are built on these mechanics and gameplay elements, and the further you progress through the game the more it expects you to master it.  One good thing is that if you don't play for a long time, the next time you do it won't be too difficult to get the hang of it again.\n\nThere were moments where it felt like one level is very hard, and the next chunk of the game is just easy, extremely basic puzzles.  There was one level that I felt stood out as way too hard, took about a half hour alone to complete, and then the rest of the game wasn't nearly as difficult.  I'd prefer a steady rise in difficulty when playing games but everyone is different, and I don't think it's too much of an issue overall.  Again, the narration and story are the main attraction here.\n\nDon't go into this game looking for hardcore platforming and twitch-reflex gameplay.  Just remember that story and presentation are what you pay for.  If you have not played Thomas Was Alone, it is worth a look.","September 9, 2014","true","4.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game is also available for PS3, PS Vita, Linux and android besides Steam's PC and Mac version.\n\nLong review\n\nThis game is about getting rectangles to the end of the level. No, seriously. These rectangles can move, jump, and some have special abilities. Also, they come in all shapes and sizes. Working together, they have to reach their corresponding exit. Sounds amazing right? No? Well, thankfully it's a bit more than that. Taking cues from the widely successful Bastion, the game's story is told by an exceptionally good narration, done by Danny Wallace (also know as Shaun from Assassin's Creed II and onward). But he is not just telling the story, he represents the thoughts and personality of the rectangles, whom by the way have their own name. How can a rectangle have personality, you might ask? They are actually A.I.s inside a computer system. A.I.s, become sentient and suddenly realizing their fate and purpose. Your job is to guide them across the hazards of the enviroment to get to their destination. Additional story bits can be seen as pieces of the programmers e-mails pop-up from time to time. So as you may have guessed, in the beginning Thomas was alone, and then came others to help him in his journey. The narration is very well written and also very humorous, frequently telling us about the A.I.s relationship with each other. As you progress through the game more and more A.I.s come, slowly introducing new personalities and abilities to the game, keeping you interested throughout the entire story. It won't be always crowded tho, the number of rectangles you have to get across are varied. But what of the hazards? Not really much to say on that regard, at first you won't have any, your goal will be to get them across walls mostly. Later comes water (which only can be traversed by one A.I.) and of course the all time favourite spikes. In the late game some of the A.I.s abilities are mixed together, so the challenge will be to maintain the use of the right one. The gameplay is solid, all movement animations are spot on and hard to find problems with them. The only thing I found hard to get hold on is the character change mechanic, I never knew which I'm going to switch to. The graphics are very minimalistic, even for a 2D platformer. All solid objects are black and every A.I. is represented by it's unique color, while the background is made of one color and a dark one at that, ocasionly having a pattern on it. Two things stood out for me in the graphics: The water looks and feels great, and the shadows also been done very well. Gravity is simulated very well, making a good jump feels satisfactory and diving into water realistic. Sadly the game comes to a short but satisfying end, lasting not much longer than six hours. Thankfully the ending is a good one, both happy and sad, and I shed a well deserved tear as the credits rolled. Achievement wise it's a fairly easy game, half of the achis are for completing the story and the other half is for finding all the hidden hollowed rectangles in the game. Some of those are a bit challenging, but nothing serious.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile Thomas Was Alone may only be a short, one time experience, it's an excellent game, achieving everything it's set out to do. The great level desing, exceptional narration will suck you in really fast and won't let you go till you finish the game. I can recommend this game to everyone, even if you don't like the genre, as the difficulty is not that high here. That may turn down some hardcore platformer fans, but even if you never come back to this game, the story still worth it alone.\n\nThanks for reading, and feel free to comment or contact.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tzumainn/recommended/220780/","tzumainn","tzumainn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tzumainn/","69 products in account","Thomas Was Alone is a sneaky, tricky, deceptive game.  I say that because so much of it is simple.  And yet...\n\nThe gameplay is straightforward. Navigate one or more blocks through short and discrete levels with simple obstacles ranging from small pits to moving platforms to spiked ceilings.  Each block has different attributes and abilities: one can jump high, one can float in water, one can act as a trampoline, and so on.  It's not a complex idea, and yet it is executed so well that it is very easy to lose yourself in the pulse of the game, playing level after level well into the night.\n\nPlaying the game is a joy, but what brings the game close to transcendence is the storytelling.  Each block has a distinct voice and, more importantly, an immediately relatable personality: one is an observer, one dreams of being a superhero, one is jealous of the others' talents.  Again nothing complex, and yet that very simplicity allows the player to immediately relate with each block - their dreams and fears and hopes and insecurities.\n\nAt first this engagement is simply amusing, another minor incentive to keep the player pushing through the game.  But as the plot unfolds and the blocks begin to understand the true nature of their situation, the player becomes truly invested.  And when the blocks individually come to their moments of self-realization, I found them each aspirational.\n\nThere are a few minor flaws in Thomas Was Alone - the last chapters feel a bit anti-climatic, and there are some annoying jumping challenges - but nothing that should stop anyone from playing the game.\n\n---------- Elliot Was Alone ------------\n\nElliot was kicking at the scruffy soccer ball when he heard his sister shout, "Cape cape CAPE!"\n\nThey were alone in their aunt's apartment, a stifling small two bedroom in a fading complex. "Better than a foster home," his aunt had shrugged. She was right, of course, and her being right just made everything worse.\n\nThe sudden spike of fury was sharp and would not be contained. Elliot set his left foot and used the right to whack the ball against the flaking wall. It bounced off with a sharp crack, and something in the bathroom fell to the floor and shattered. Elliot cursed - loudly - and slammed open the door to the bedroom that he shared with his sister.\n\n"You're not supposed to say that word," Abby said without looking up. Being chastised by a sibling four years his junior - or was it five? it was strangely difficult to keep track these days, with time feeling soft like clay - did little to improve his mood. "A cape?" he said, ignoring her comment. "You made your dumb blocks capes?"\n\nNow Abby did look up, but only to smile. "Just one cape," she said, holding up a badly cut paper square. There was a picture on it, drawn in crayon, of something that might have been a mutated two-headed cat. "Claire wants one."\n\nElliot rolled his eyes. "Claire" was a big wooden cube scribbled through with whorls of blue. Months after the accident Abby had taken six or seven of her blocks and colored them each with its own color. Then she had given them not only names, but distinct personalities as well. "Thomas likes to watch things," she might say as she bounced the red block along the floor. Or,\ntossing the purple one up into the air: "Look! How can Sarah even go so high? She must have amazing powers!"\n\nSometimes it was all Elliot could do to stop himself from throwing the blocks down the garbage chute. He imagined the pleasure he would feel listening to the gong-like sounds the blocks would make as they bounced off the sides.\n\n"Claire's a superhero, you see," Abby continued in a matter-of-fact tone. "She's the only one of them that can float in water. Like a rubber duckie." She put her hand to the side of her mouth; whispering loudly she said, "She can't jump very high though, but. . . look what happens when she jumps on top of Laura!" Laura was a pink block laying horizontally on the ground. Abby took Claire and touched the blue block to Laura; then she made a whooshing noise and arced\nClaire high over her head.\n\nElliot could only stare. "Are you kidding me?"\n\nAbby looked puzzled. "Kidding about what?" She set Claire before her and reached for the cape.\n\n"About. . . about all of this!" He squatted down. "It's all so stupid," he said, picking up a yellow block and shaking it in front of Abby's face. His anger was growing again, like it so often did these days. He didn't want it to. He just couldn't help it. "And this cape, what do you think it - ?"\n\nHe snatched at the cape expecting his sister to let go, like she always did when he grabbed at something. But this time her skinny fingers held on tight. And the paper ripped in two.\n\nThe silence that ensued rang loudly in Elliot's ears. Time crept like a worm while his face flamed and his stomach roiled, and it was an eternity before he finally stammered, "I. . . I didn't mean. . ." Then he stopped. Because of course what was meant didn't matter. Nothing that had happened in the past year had been meant. But it was, and why did it always feel like he was the one, the only one, that had to deal with the consequences?\n\nThe resentment inside of him was like a stone; it centered him. He took a sullen breath. "It was just a dumb cape. I can -" he began. Then he met Abby's eyes and stopped again, this time out of shock. Her face was stiff and her eyes were burning, and although he had never seen his sister that way, he recognized the look at once - because it was like looking in a mirror. And that was when he realized that he wasn't the only one that had to deal with consequences.\n\n"I'm sorry," he whispered. "I'm sorry. Can I - ?"\n\n"No!" she shrieked, and Elliot watched, sick inside, as she half-rose with the force of her word.\n\n"Yes," Abby muttered, sitting back down. She tossed a small orange block at him; he caught it\ out of the air. "You can be Chris."\n\nElliot kept his mouth shut, swallowing his first response back down his throat. Then he asked in an even voice, "What's Chris like? What can he do?"\n\n"Nothing," snapped his sister. "He's small and mean and he can't even jump very high."\n\nHis anger was gone now. It had been replaced by shame, a whole ocean of it, enough to drown him a thousand times over. Was it better to feel like this? He rubbed his eyes. Maybe it was. At least he wouldn't hurt anybody this way.\n\nAbby touched his arm then, softly. "Hey," she said. "But, you know, Chris isn't. . . he isn't really\nmean. He's just confused. Confused and. . ." She paused. ". . . and sad." Her face relaxed. "He doesn't know it yet, but he's going to be a hero. Just like the rest of them."\n\nElliot smiled. "Tell me."\n\nAbby began to talk, and Elliot sat and watched in wonder as his sister's face bloomed once more.","May 18, 2014","true","4.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game is also available for PS3, PS Vita, Linux and android besides Steam's PC and Mac version.\n\nLong review\n\nThis game is about getting rectangles to the end of the level. No, seriously. These rectangles can move, jump, and some have special abilities. Also, they come in all shapes and sizes. Working together, they have to reach their corresponding exit. Sounds amazing right? No? Well, thankfully it's a bit more than that. Taking cues from the widely successful Bastion, the game's story is told by an exceptionally good narration, done by Danny Wallace (also know as Shaun from Assassin's Creed II and onward). But he is not just telling the story, he represents the thoughts and personality of the rectangles, whom by the way have their own name. How can a rectangle have personality, you might ask? They are actually A.I.s inside a computer system. A.I.s, become sentient and suddenly realizing their fate and purpose. Your job is to guide them across the hazards of the enviroment to get to their destination. Additional story bits can be seen as pieces of the programmers e-mails pop-up from time to time. So as you may have guessed, in the beginning Thomas was alone, and then came others to help him in his journey. The narration is very well written and also very humorous, frequently telling us about the A.I.s relationship with each other. As you progress through the game more and more A.I.s come, slowly introducing new personalities and abilities to the game, keeping you interested throughout the entire story. It won't be always crowded tho, the number of rectangles you have to get across are varied. But what of the hazards? Not really much to say on that regard, at first you won't have any, your goal will be to get them across walls mostly. Later comes water (which only can be traversed by one A.I.) and of course the all time favourite spikes. In the late game some of the A.I.s abilities are mixed together, so the challenge will be to maintain the use of the right one. The gameplay is solid, all movement animations are spot on and hard to find problems with them. The only thing I found hard to get hold on is the character change mechanic, I never knew which I'm going to switch to. The graphics are very minimalistic, even for a 2D platformer. All solid objects are black and every A.I. is represented by it's unique color, while the background is made of one color and a dark one at that, ocasionly having a pattern on it. Two things stood out for me in the graphics: The water looks and feels great, and the shadows also been done very well. Gravity is simulated very well, making a good jump feels satisfactory and diving into water realistic. Sadly the game comes to a short but satisfying end, lasting not much longer than six hours. Thankfully the ending is a good one, both happy and sad, and I shed a well deserved tear as the credits rolled. Achievement wise it's a fairly easy game, half of the achis are for completing the story and the other half is for finding all the hidden hollowed rectangles in the game. Some of those are a bit challenging, but nothing serious.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile Thomas Was Alone may only be a short, one time experience, it's an excellent game, achieving everything it's set out to do. The great level desing, exceptional narration will suck you in really fast and won't let you go till you finish the game. I can recommend this game to everyone, even if you don't like the genre, as the difficulty is not that high here. That may turn down some hardcore platformer fans, but even if you never come back to this game, the story still worth it alone.\n\nThanks for reading, and feel free to comment or contact.

At its core, the game is a simple platformer.  As you progress through the story, however, you unlock more and more characters.  Each character has their own special power.  As the levels get harder, you will have to learn to master these powers to continue on in the story.  The story in Thomas Was Alone is its crowning achievement.  Narrated through each level, you'll quickly find yourself immersed with the story of Thomas and his friends.","June 20, 2014","true","4.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Controls are great, for what they are (literally just move and jump) - may be a little tighter with a controller but keyboard works great too. Each of the individual 'characters' are unique and they feel different enough to be justified as a separate character and not just a clone of an exisiting one. Minor puzzling elements, mostly to work out how to use the 2-to-9 different characters you are controlling in order to get them all to their exit portals - and there are very few places where you can actually get stuck and have to restart the level; there is usually a way to backtrack (or, you just die and respawn).\n\nThe narration is very much a defining feature, and is a driving force in wanting to continue (to the point of completing all 100 levels in one sitting). It is delivered by a fantastic narrator, in chunks of about 2 bits of narration per level, and it is all interesting and often genuinely funny. It has a feel of Bastion to it, without outright copying it or being obvious about its inspiration.\n\nIt is not a difficult game, and can be beaten in around 3 hours (including finding all the achievement mcguffins, which aren't hard to find and collect). It is no harder than a standard 2D Mario game, really. Certainly no Super Meat Boy.\n\nIf you like platformers, this is a must buy. If you do not like platformers, you may not get as much enjoyment from this but I still suggest picking it up (maybe in a sale) and giving it a play - the narration and story may hook you in to finish it.","February 5, 2014","true","4.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

Literally and figuratively.\nThe game has a nice way of combining the introduction of new gameplay concepts and narrative and can be praised for how these two elements are interwoven. However, both gameplay and story seem a bit stretched with a lot of repetition, sometimes even within one level. It alomst seems like the developers had an idea how long the game should be, but they didn't have enough unique ideas to fill that time so they built in some repetitions. There is no proper difficulty curve to speak of, even in the later episodes you can come across levels that are easy and easily forgettable. Considering that this is a puzzle platformer where you would expect an increasing difficulty and new puzzling ideas with each new level, these are major problems\nThe narrative takes quite some time to become interesting and to make sense of what story is supposed to be told. There are hints what's going on even in the earlier levels and the narrator does a nice job giving character to the moving blocks, but it took until about the second half of the game for me to become more enganged in what's happening. The finale is also not the most satisfying one.\n\nThe soundtrack can become very annoying and even though its supposed to be dynamic and procedurally generated, I can't see at all how its supposed to fit the gameplay. The OST has an ambient/post-rock vibe to it and randomly becomes very noisy and agitated, which NEVER fit the situation, even in more climactic points of the story.\n\nI'd still recommend this game for its unique experimental approach in using video games as a storytelling medium. It has some artistic value because it finds new ways of conveying ideas and has an approach to narrative which creates characters where you would least expect them. It is however not flawless and has the above mentioned pacing and sound problems.\n\nIf you're primarily interested in minimalist, abstract, experimental aspects of games, then go and get it.\n\n\n","June 17, 2015","true","5.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The only big downside is that the game tends to crash, a lot. This happened to me half way through the game and it was very annoying and frustrating.

So I had to play the game in the lowest quality and small screen and even then the game kept crashing, oh well.

At least… for me it is.\n\nSounds a little weird, but it really is a wonderful little indie game. Getting to know the characters and watch how things progress was a great experience. Especially seeing as the characters are common shapes. They aren’t exactly things you would usually try to make an emotional connection with.\nIn fact, the whole thing kind of reminds me of an experience I had when I gave gel pens personality’s and made up a story about them in my head whilst on MDMA once. The shapes in this game being the gel pens and the guy narrating being me. Weird, I know. But this game reminds me of that bazaar experience. You grow to like the characters and there little ponderings about who or what they are.\n\nIt has beautiful music to go along side it, and even though the graphics may be simple, they more than definitely do the trick at setting the scene. It’s simplistic but in a good way. I guess it makes it so you don’t get all that distracted from the story or the characters. Them being the main focus I would say.\n\nThe narration of the story was done well, a “quirky” Brit doing the voice was quite nice. I got the “Wheatley from portal 2” vibe off of it, but that may just be because they sound similar. I’ve noticed a few games that use the British narrator in a similar fashion.\n\nIt would be lie to say I followed the storyline 100% the whole way through, I’m even a little confused even after finishing it, but in a good way. A kind of curiosity which made me want to read up about it. Which I guess is always good, it shows that I found it intriguing.\n\nThe game is easily played through in one sitting (at least that was the case for me) but I quite liked the length of it, it wasn’t too long and it was quite easy to complete, achievements and all.\nIt feels good to have another 100% game and it was quite an easy one to get.\n\nAll in all I really liked this game, and would highly recommend it. If you love indie games this is definitely one to have. The whole thing with the characters being common shapes was a real plus for me, it makes the game more unique.\n\nTL;DR : Intriguing story, likeable narrator, good characters, nice graphics, beautiful music and more.

The game tells a story about friendship based on rectangular shaped character, using a narrator who leads the player through the game. The goal of the game is to lead each character to the end of a level in order to proceed to the next level. To complete a level, characters are required to work together and use their different abilities to help each other.\n\nFirst of I have to say the game is really short, it took me about 1.5 hours to finish it 100%. This isn't necessarily a bad thing though, it depends on your personal preference. In my opinion the short playtime suits the minimalist style of the game. Another thing that might or might not be a downside is that the platforming as well as the puzzle aspect of the game is really easy, but like I said before, it's personal preference.\n\nThe music and the voice of the narrator complement each other very well, the audio overall creates a calm and appeasing atmosphere. The visuals are minimalist, which is a definite advantage in my opinion, and suit the basic gameplay and calm atmosphere of this game very well. The background and the environment is often in a dusky tone and the characters are light-coloured, which creates the lost feeling.\n\nThomas Was Alone combines great storytelling with an innovative visualisation, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who plays games as a pastime or anyone who plays just to win. This game isn't about winning or about beating it, it's about experiencing the story. It's about enjoying the art and watching the characters proceed.

If you've ever come across any topics of the "are games art" subject, chances are Thomas Was Alone was mentioned.\n\nThe main draw here is the polished presentation and music contrasted with the simple graphics and mostly simple gameplay.  The music is modern "feel-good" toned stuff mixed with minor techno bleeps and bips.  There is a narrator that basically is the bulk of the story, explaining what the characters are feeling and what they're thinking.  You'll go from characters that are perky and lively to the ones that lack self-confidence, all the way to the bashful youth types and the double-crossers.\n\nOf course, the characters here are the Atari / Tetris type blocks.  Each character controls differently, some are quick and able to leap anywhere, others are slow and bulky, others can double jump or act as platforms over dangerous water.  The puzzles are built on these mechanics and gameplay elements, and the further you progress through the game the more it expects you to master it.  One good thing is that if you don't play for a long time, the next time you do it won't be too difficult to get the hang of it again.\n\nThere were moments where it felt like one level is very hard, and the next chunk of the game is just easy, extremely basic puzzles.  There was one level that I felt stood out as way too hard, took about a half hour alone to complete, and then the rest of the game wasn't nearly as difficult.  I'd prefer a steady rise in difficulty when playing games but everyone is different, and I don't think it's too much of an issue overall.  Again, the narration and story are the main attraction here.\n\nDon't go into this game looking for hardcore platforming and twitch-reflex gameplay.  Just remember that story and presentation are what you pay for.  If you have not played Thomas Was Alone, it is worth a look.","September 9, 2014","true","4.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game somehow manages to get you to develop sympathy and scorn for the otherwise-generic blocks you control. Other strong points are the music, voice acting, visual aesthetic, and varied jumping mechanics and player-character properties.  I think a weak point is the difficulty level--it's pretty low. Not once did I have to think for more than 5 seconds before figuring out the puzzles.  So eventually the levels became rituals of moving the blocks around so I could get to the next level and move the story along.\n\nWhat made me buy this game ultimately was that Kotaku said "The jump in Thomas Was Alone might be amongst the best ever programmed." So, as a platformer junky, I couldn't pass it up.  The jumps are indeed very good. You're quite firmly in control of the little blocks, although sometimes I felt like the acceleration late in the jump was a little too high, but that's a personal preference. My jump mechanic award goes to Super Meat Boy and Spelunky, but whatever.\n\nAll in all, this game delivers a good platform/puzzle experience with a unique and compelling story, which is very rare in this genre.\n","January 29, 2014","true","5.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Controls are great, for what they are (literally just move and jump) - may be a little tighter with a controller but keyboard works great too. Each of the individual 'characters' are unique and they feel different enough to be justified as a separate character and not just a clone of an exisiting one. Minor puzzling elements, mostly to work out how to use the 2-to-9 different characters you are controlling in order to get them all to their exit portals - and there are very few places where you can actually get stuck and have to restart the level; there is usually a way to backtrack (or, you just die and respawn).\n\nThe narration is very much a defining feature, and is a driving force in wanting to continue (to the point of completing all 100 levels in one sitting). It is delivered by a fantastic narrator, in chunks of about 2 bits of narration per level, and it is all interesting and often genuinely funny. It has a feel of Bastion to it, without outright copying it or being obvious about its inspiration.\n\nIt is not a difficult game, and can be beaten in around 3 hours (including finding all the achievement mcguffins, which aren't hard to find and collect). It is no harder than a standard 2D Mario game, really. Certainly no Super Meat Boy.\n\nIf you like platformers, this is a must buy. If you do not like platformers, you may not get as much enjoyment from this but I still suggest picking it up (maybe in a sale) and giving it a play - the narration and story may hook you in to finish it.","February 5, 2014","true","4.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

It is a tale involving rectangles as the main characters.  About half way through the adventure you realize that you really care about them.  A moving and subtle soundtrack coupled with superb writing and narration breathes more life and  humanity into the rectangles than 90% of any other game or movie in recent memory.  The story is not complex.  It is a straight-forward epic of friendship and sacrifice but so well done that it doesn't need any plot twists or suprise revelations to be impactful.  The gameplay is fairly simple puzzle platforming.  You are always pretty sure exactly how to get through the level.  Although simple I still found the gameplay enjoyable.  There are some really clever uses of the game's mechanics and different characer's abilities working together sprinkled throughout the game but no real mind straining puzzles.  The design of the levels is really sharp so the simplicity of the puzzles seems to be a design chioce so as not to get in the way of the narrative the developers were trying to tell.

At least… for me it is.\n\nSounds a little weird, but it really is a wonderful little indie game. Getting to know the characters and watch how things progress was a great experience. Especially seeing as the characters are common shapes. They aren’t exactly things you would usually try to make an emotional connection with.\nIn fact, the whole thing kind of reminds me of an experience I had when I gave gel pens personality’s and made up a story about them in my head whilst on MDMA once. The shapes in this game being the gel pens and the guy narrating being me. Weird, I know. But this game reminds me of that bazaar experience. You grow to like the characters and there little ponderings about who or what they are.\n\nIt has beautiful music to go along side it, and even though the graphics may be simple, they more than definitely do the trick at setting the scene. It’s simplistic but in a good way. I guess it makes it so you don’t get all that distracted from the story or the characters. Them being the main focus I would say.\n\nThe narration of the story was done well, a “quirky” Brit doing the voice was quite nice. I got the “Wheatley from portal 2” vibe off of it, but that may just be because they sound similar. I’ve noticed a few games that use the British narrator in a similar fashion.\n\nIt would be lie to say I followed the storyline 100% the whole way through, I’m even a little confused even after finishing it, but in a good way. A kind of curiosity which made me want to read up about it. Which I guess is always good, it shows that I found it intriguing.\n\nThe game is easily played through in one sitting (at least that was the case for me) but I quite liked the length of it, it wasn’t too long and it was quite easy to complete, achievements and all.\nIt feels good to have another 100% game and it was quite an easy one to get.\n\nAll in all I really liked this game, and would highly recommend it. If you love indie games this is definitely one to have. The whole thing with the characters being common shapes was a real plus for me, it makes the game more unique.\n\nTL;DR : Intriguing story, likeable narrator, good characters, nice graphics, beautiful music and more.

Literally and figuratively.\nThe game has a nice way of combining the introduction of new gameplay concepts and narrative and can be praised for how these two elements are interwoven. However, both gameplay and story seem a bit stretched with a lot of repetition, sometimes even within one level. It alomst seems like the developers had an idea how long the game should be, but they didn't have enough unique ideas to fill that time so they built in some repetitions. There is no proper difficulty curve to speak of, even in the later episodes you can come across levels that are easy and easily forgettable. Considering that this is a puzzle platformer where you would expect an increasing difficulty and new puzzling ideas with each new level, these are major problems\nThe narrative takes quite some time to become interesting and to make sense of what story is supposed to be told. There are hints what's going on even in the earlier levels and the narrator does a nice job giving character to the moving blocks, but it took until about the second half of the game for me to become more enganged in what's happening. The finale is also not the most satisfying one.\n\nThe soundtrack can become very annoying and even though its supposed to be dynamic and procedurally generated, I can't see at all how its supposed to fit the gameplay. The OST has an ambient/post-rock vibe to it and randomly becomes very noisy and agitated, which NEVER fit the situation, even in more climactic points of the story.\n\nI'd still recommend this game for its unique experimental approach in using video games as a storytelling medium. It has some artistic value because it finds new ways of conveying ideas and has an approach to narrative which creates characters where you would least expect them. It is however not flawless and has the above mentioned pacing and sound problems.\n\nIf you're primarily interested in minimalist, abstract, experimental aspects of games, then go and get it.\n\n\n","June 17, 2015","true","5.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You control Thomas along with his other pals that have their own special abilities to help you advance through the mazes and puzzles. The music is wonderful and very peaceful too. The only big downside is that the game tends to crash, a lot. This happened to me half way through the game and it was very annoying and frustrating. People suggest to set the settings to Windows me/98, well I did that and the game refused to start. So I had to play the game in the lowest quality and small screen and even then the game kept crashing, oh well. So despite the annoying crashes that I can never fix, this game is great, and the narrator is pretty good at telling the story while thorwing in some jokes here and there.

Just about everything in the game is minimalistic yet impactful:\nVisually, the game is almost entirely made up rectangles: including the characters you play as.\nThe controls are simple as a platformer can get: move and jump. With an extra button for switching characters.\nThe object of each level is to move all of the available rectangles to their respectively shaped exits.\nThe story is told through wonderfully conceived and delivered narration during gameplay, a few lines of text in between each level, and the actions the player takes based on the design of each level.\nThe soundtrack is sublime in the way it perfectly sets the mood without being distracting.Yet, despite all the simplicity, I couldn’t stop playing, and I felt utterly invested in the plight of a collection of different colored quadrilaterals.\n\nRecommended for:  Those interested in a 2D platformer and/or puzzle game that challenging, but not too hard.\nPeople who are interested in seeing how gameplay and level design can be effectively used as storytelling tools.\nAnyone looking for a good game that you can play to completion, but don’t have a lot of time to invest.\nHuman beings and likely other forms of sentient life as well.\nNot recommend for:  Those looking for a challenge in the most brutal sense of the word. There are other puzzle/platformers that will give you the punishment you crave.\nPeople looking for a game to spend hours playing, or one with high replay-ability. This game is rather short, and once it’s done, there is little reason to go back to it.\nAnyone that is incapable of feeling empathy: particularly towards rectangles. This game just isn’t for you.  Conclusion: I would recommend Thomas Was Alone to nearly every person I would care to meet.","December 29, 2015","true","6.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

This game is one of the greatest games I have ever played, somehow managing to stay in my mind even though I haven't played it in a while.\nThomas was Alone feature a LOT of (in-story) AIs that you must guide through different levels, each one equipped with different abilities than the other making this feel like true "single-player cooperative".\nThese AIs, though depicted as differently colored and sized quadrelaterals, are some of the most shockingly human characters I've seen (in gaming) yet. These characters are well written to the level of Telltale's The Walking Dead, Bioshock, or even Mass Effect (2).\nAlong with this, the game's soundtrack is stellar, perfectly fitting the game (maybe not your musical taste, but it fits the atmosphere). The visuals also work with this to create a game that feels very sterile, which actually allows the player to easily understand what's going on and accentuates the aliveness of the characters.\n\nBut that would be leaving out two major issues- the user interface, namely switching between characters, can be quite annoying and tedious, which makes some of the levels even more excrutiating. This comes to its apex when you have to control a team of 5 completely identical characters by manually switching between each one. This team is also present in the other issue- the story's ending.\nWithout giving spoilers, the story goes on longer than it needs to. Granted, I would have loved to stay with the enthusiastic Thomas and the sassy Chris for much longer, but that wasn't what the "extra bit" of story gave me. However, I must give credit where it is due- the extra bit of story, while seeming a bit rushed, provided one of the best endings possible. While I was satisfied with what I thought was the ending, I was much more pleased with the actual end.\n\nAlways remember,\nUp and to the right","December 2, 2014","true","5.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There's about 90 levels, but many of them can be solved in less than a minute or two. Has a nice Bastion-eque story telling vibe about friendship and cooperation.

This makes Thomas Was Alone a great game to play to relieve stress or just kill some time.\nThe narrative is witty and superbly executed, just be careful to let him finish before moving onto the next level.\n\nIf the $10 price tag seems a little high for 4hrs of gameplay (which is how long it will take if you do not go for every achievement), buy it on sale.\n\nMy one complaint is some stuttering between levels.","May 30","true","4.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If it were a tripod then the three legs it stands on would be Design, Music and Storytelling.\n\nDesign\nThe game is really clean and stylish, they've pushed this poshy zen minimalism that Steve Jobs  used on Apple products. Thomas Was Alone could easily be considered a lifestyle game, a building block for identity and self determination.Does it work for the game's benefit? Indeed it does, the game feels attractive, smart and easy on the eye.\n\nMusic\nThe music is again something that's extremely classy for a computer game. They use minimalistic melodies combined from crisp clean piano and radically electronic soundscape which kind you'd expect to find from a Björk album. In-game it kinda helps to reflect the openness of the space. A soothing experience to the ear.\n\nStorytelling\nThere's an amusing story to the game. The cubes, that the player controls are all different characters with their own ups and downs and their own agendas. The story is delivered by a British-sounding narrator who manages to make it humorous, personal and overall soulful.\n\n\nCouple of things that bugged me:\n\n- Too many too simplistic levels in the first part of the game. There were these levels where you figure out the solution in 5 seconds and then it takes 2-3 minutes to complete it, which didn't feel very rewarding.\n\n- For some reason jumps are not registered upon gentle tapping of the space button. Instead you have to smash it down quite hard.\n\nVerdict:\nThe trouble they've gone into making the whole thing such a complete experience shows the developers seriousness and makes it easy to appreciate the hard work they've done. The game is a piece of art and if aesthetics is important to you then this one might be a treat.","July 10, 2015","true","7.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You then start your adventure off into the unknown not knowing is what ahead meeting other shapes along the way. I have never been more attached to a basic shape in a video game till this game.\n\nThe Narration is fantastic.

A great game. A fantastic game.\n\nYou play as a cast of rectangles and squares, inside a program dedicated to creating artificial intelligence. They all have names. The one you start out with is Thomas, and he is alone. In the beginning of the game, you realize that Thomas would meet an untimely end, in some shape or form, but you play the game to get a feel for it's controls.\n\nAnd then, the game takes a pleasant turn.\n\nThe narraration is beautiful. The voice tells you what all of the characters are thinking and expressing, without a need for voice actors. It makes each character, while different in play style, relatable or at the very least, understandable. For being two dimensional objects, they all form three dimensional personalities. The fact that they have different and unique abilities changes up the puzzles and makes the game much more fantastic. It really feels like you're exploring a virtual world born with artificial intelligence. And the game does this without cutscenes or character voices.\n\nThe puzzles are fun, the gameplay easy to pick up, and even though the levels are fairly basic, it has it's share of moderate difficulty situations. I wish it had some harder ones. The controls are fluid and the game is solidly built because of that. Nothing terrible complex and no bugs as far as I can tell.\n\n\n(SPOILER ALERT)\n\nAs you continue through the game, there's a point at which Thomas and your original cast... just aren't there anymore. Maybe this was to make it so that you valued the characters more, but it simply made me upset. The ending that I was expecting for my main cast didn't exist. They didn't go out in a blaze of glory or defy the original premise of the game or become true heroes. The game just pretended like they never existed.\n\nAnd that's what drew out the last few levels. The storyline drew me in so that I could recite the orginal cast by name and what their personality was like, even though the game is just a series of rectangles. The game took that story away from me. The game cheated me out of all the friends that I had fallen in love with. It was no longer about a story, but getting to the end. That seemed boring and almost repetitive.\n\nOverall, this is a good game, but the story will aggrivate you to your very core. My heart tells me to rate it less and my brain tells me to rate it more, but it's a solid 8/10.","June 9, 2014","true","3.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","75","3","4","4","0"

One interesting effect about the graphics was how the light on a block followed you as you moved, making it seem more advanced and visually easier to follow what was going on. It probably isn't so noticeable unless you were really concentrating.\n\nMusic\n\nFor a puzzle game, this has really relaxing music, which is nice considering puzzle games can at times get your brain really crunching in how to solve something, or stress you out. The music helps make it a more enjoyable process. The sounds itself help give character for the whole experience. The different sounds the boxes make give each one insight to their personalities, and the voiceover with an english accent is soothing and fits right in with the background music and the individual noises the rectangles make.

And if not, it's pretty high up there. Now, don't get me wrong, when I say "low budget", I don't mean it's half-♥♥♥♥♥ in any way. It's actually really well made - rather, the look of it is purposely lo-fi. You play as a red rectangle named Thomas whose goal is to make it through a series of 2D puzzle-platforming levels. Along the way you'll also meet other colored rectangles, each with their own unique abilities and personality. And that's all I'll really say about the plot. Suffice it to say that you will be amazed at how much you'll actually care about a bunch of little rectangles. That is due in equal parts to the writing and the well-done narration that accompanies it. As for the actual gameplay, it's good, but very easy. The levels involve puzzle-solving and platforming, but neither aspect is even remotely difficult, except perhaps in a couple of spots here and there (which I would classify more as tedious than hard). So this is not a game you should buy looking for a challenge. You should buy it if you are into indie games with unique looks, story and ideas. It's a great experience, all around - a perfect casual game to while away an afternoon. The game will take around 3-4 hours total, including all secrets, so it's not very long, but it also doesn't overstay its welcome. Definitely check it out if you like these types of games.","August 20, 2013","true","4.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

We are all alone, yet we are not alone. We hate others even though we love them, too. When we want to be away from others, we resent the presence of those around us, yet we are never fully at peace when in solitude.\n\nThomas Was Alone is the most introspective puzzle game I've ever played. It isn't really a game, it's something else. In spite of TWA's classification as a puzzle game, it's not really about puzzle solving. It's an experience about solitude, isolation, the fear and sorrows of being alone, as well as the joys and annoyances of being with company. It's about coming to terms with your imperfections and learning to love what makes others unique. Yet it's never ham-fisted about these points. This game's amazing script truly makes you care for these characters and never comes across as being overly sentimental or kitschy.\n\nIf all you want is a recommendation, I can say wholeheartedly that I do recommend this. Do yourself a favor and go into the game blind; you'll appreciate it more.\n\nThat being said, I do have a few complaints about the game. There are slight spoilers so read below at your own caution. First of all, the jump ability seems slightly buggy. There's an obvious delay from when you press the jump button to when the character actually jumps; it seems somewhere between 1/3 and 1/2 of a second, which I found annoying. Also, the game sometimes just won't let you jump. This happened to me on a number of occasions, where I'd run toward the edge of a platform and clearly press the jump button, only to fall to my death. It's quite annoying and seems like it could be easily fixed. Secondly, the balance between puzzle to puzzle is sometimes questionable. Sometimes you'll have a puzzle that takes a long time and is slightly confusing, followed by a very simple one. It seems odd, because normally one expects the puzzles to get gradually harder, which they do for the most part, but every once in a while you get a very easy one to come after a harder one (I'm thinking specifically of the last level, which was ridiculously easy). Thirdly, the game is often quick to drops things it introduces. I'm thinking here of the white diamond shape, which is featured in something like 3 or 4 levels in a row and then completely abandoned. Fourthly, I have to mention achievements. Normally I don't care one way or another about achievements, but here they just made it too easy to get them all. On my first and only playthrough, I got all of them, and I only had to restart a couple levels to get the ones I missed. Almost all of them are obvious and easy to get to. Why didn't they make some more challenging? Speaking of challenge, I didn't find many of the puzzles that difficult. I respect a game whose puzzles are straightforward and unobtuse, but these ones just seemed easy. Some took a while to do, but most were overall very easy.\n\nLastly and most importantly, I have a HUGE complaint about the story. Up until the second to last chapter, the story was very good. Then the final chapter drops almost everything it had been doing up to that point to introduce completely new characters, and a lot of them. The story changes almost entirely for the last bit of the game, which leads to a very abrupt and inconclusive ending without the final characters. It was as if the developers either realized they had to make the game longer or they couldn't figure out how to add the gimmick of the last chapter without those characters. I thought it would've been better if the last section had to utilize all the characters' abilities together in complex ways instead of adding a new aspect at the very end.\n\nOverall, this is a very good indie game in spite of the problems I had with it. I especially recommend it to younger players, as it's very kid-friendly and the puzzles seem geared toward kids.","January 10, 2015","true","4.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Yeah, I was a bit late to the party, this game being released in 2010 (and then later in 2012), but it is probably rather timeless (at least until true AI become an important reality), with its minimalistic art design, Danny Wallace's fantastic narration, Valve-and-Douglas-Adams-inspired design and writing, and David Housden's simply gorgeous score.\n\nIf you are looking for a game that has one or seven of those breathtaking, awe-inspiring moments, all while only being a game about squares and rectangles, I urgently recommend Thomas Was Alone. In addition it creates more emotional investment and demonstrates better character development than most triple-A games, again, all while being the unwavering story of a few quadrilaterals.\n\nTHIS IS ART.\n\nP.S. - While the main game is just sheerly fantastic, the additional chapters 10 and 11 are better worth skipping. The quality of voice acting or composition of course does not waver, although I would argue the story is much less compelling, but I would advice against really trying to playthrough Benjamin's story simply because the actual gameplay falters wildly. It moves away from the brilliant and elegant puzzle-platforming to just that really infuriating kind of platforming. No thought needed, at least initially, just irritating execution that really breaks the beauty of the game.\n\nI don't typically condone watching Let's Plays about a game you haven't played; actually I think it's the worst thing you can possibly do, as the entire unique point of games is their interactive element, and when you delegate the experience to watching someone else play it, you are completely removing the immersion and ruining very deliberate game design (as opposed to a passive media like film or music).\nHowever, getting through mindless execution challenges is usually not worth the hours spent if you don't enjoy that kind of thing, and watching someone else play the extra levels may be the most prudent option.\nBut of course if you like that kind of painstaking gameplay where it's just thick trial-and-death design without the strategic or puzzle-based aspects (or the rare and wonderful design where dying doesn't break the fun like in Super Meat Boy or Long Live The Queen), go for it.\n\nAgain, these last extra two chapters are additional, and the core game is well worth the price.","January 11, 2015","true","7.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As the narrorator speaks, the characters come to life, without even having to change his speach.\n\nThomas Was Alone shows an amazing indie game, where it's noted that games do not need the highest graphics in the world, but only serve to tell a story.\n\n10/10 I highly recommend this game.\n\n*Notes: I bought this game on sale for ~$3.

Buying this game supports the clever, innovative mind of a single specific person, Mike Bithell.  I remember when I first started playing, I tweeted the developer that the game was super enjoyable.  Months later I returned and finished the story over a few quiet evenings.  So engaging, so rewarding.  This feels like gaming in a futuristic society where leisure time is abundant and gaming is widespread as a form of education and stimulation, instead of just addictive.  As the game progresses your mental labels of the various rectangles stops being their color or their size, and you start to identify them by name.  The game doesn't force that anthropormophization, but it's so much richer for it.  Similarly, you couldn't just listen to the narration without the context of the game and understand the story, it's a journey you take together.  Can you imagine if Smithsonian exhibits were given as much attention to engagement?","July 29, 2014","true","4.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Quirky, variable narration and a broad range of individual capabilities establish remarkable character diversity, while a masterfully-paced soundtrack allows for an engaging and emotionally immersive experience. The puzzles are challenging, but the mechanics are both encouraging and a lot of fun to learn. Thomas Was Alone entails simple, sweet storylines about friendship and rivalry, self-confidence and pride, teamwork and isolation—all of which are propelled by the design of the platforms themselves and the gradual introduction of new elements throughout gameplay.

Buying this game supports the clever, innovative mind of a single specific person, Mike Bithell.  I remember when I first started playing, I tweeted the developer that the game was super enjoyable.  Months later I returned and finished the story over a few quiet evenings.  So engaging, so rewarding.  This feels like gaming in a futuristic society where leisure time is abundant and gaming is widespread as a form of education and stimulation, instead of just addictive.  As the game progresses your mental labels of the various rectangles stops being their color or their size, and you start to identify them by name.  The game doesn't force that anthropormophization, but it's so much richer for it.  Similarly, you couldn't just listen to the narration without the context of the game and understand the story, it's a journey you take together.  Can you imagine if Smithsonian exhibits were given as much attention to engagement?","July 29, 2014","true","4.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Yet ANOTHER puzzle-platformer to add to my library, play for 15 minutes, get bored and uninstall. With that attitude in place, I can say I was very pleasantly surprised when I started playing.\n\nThe game oozes charm (It's a cliche for indie game reviews, but I'm not clever enough to come up with a better way of saying it). It's visually simple, yet you find yourself attached to the characters introduced to you. This is because the narrator does an excellent job making each character's personality unique. You end up caring about them and get invested in their journey.\n\nThere's not much puzzle-platforming here, just platforming, and it's not too hard. This might not be a plus for some people, but it was for me. I didn't get frustrated and I was able to enjoy the narrative, story and music.\n\nThe music is another highlight along with the narration. It's soothing, beautiful and a tad bit sad. Definitely something I'll be adding to my music library.\n\nDon't let your "indie platformer" fatigue get in the way, play this and enjoy it.\n\n(Two more positive things.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ErgoMeSmart/recommended/220780/","ErgoMeSmart","Ergo Me Smart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ErgoMeSmart/","1086 products in account","First, a quick note. This review was originally written for the now-dead indietheory.com before the game was released on Steam, thus the low play time on Steam for the game.\n\nThomas was alone. Wow. A weird first thought to have.\n\nSomething has gone wrong and the AI have become self-aware in the system. It's now your role to take these AI to a life they've never known; one up, and to the left.\n\nAlthough the game has a very simple design to it, with every playable character just a different sized square or rectangle of a different colour, and the platforms just blackness in front of the background, it manages to create its own unique art style that is a pleasure to look at. The characters also always stand out from the background vividly, with the platforms also standing out well against the background. Thus meaning there is never any confusion of what is a platform and what isn't.\n\nAlthough the graphical style creates some of the mood, it has to be said that the sound is a very large part of it. Firstly, there is David Housden's soundtrack. Just classical enough to add some emotion to the game, while also adding in enough electronic elements to fit in with the plot of AI escaping a system. Although one track is looped throughout each stage of ten levels, this is hardly noticeable with the music managing to stay on-theme.\n\nThen there is also the narration throughout from Danny Wallace, which creates a voice for each character. It means the game is given a plot and each character a personality, resulting in that you start to care for each little square and rectangle. Without this narration, the game would just be a decent looking platformer with a good soundtrack. It'd still be a fine game, but this manages to take it that one step further and develops a story in which you want to know what happens next.\n\nAs for the platforming action itself, it's hardly the most advanced you'll find in a game, but it works and it works well. You can control one character on the screen at a time, with each character slightly different from each other. One might be taller and thus be able to jump higher, another will be smaller and be able to fit in small spaces, while a couple even float in water and allow others to bounce on top of them. This means that each one's strengths have to be used to get others to the finish. Two could form steps to help a smaller character to a higher place it can't reach through jumping, for example.\n\nThis is one of the finest all-round games I have played in quite some time and as such can not recommended enough by me. The platforming works perfectly, the different characters add variety to the gameplay, and the soundtrack and narration sets the mood for the game, managing to make you care for what are after all "just" quadrilateral shapes. The lack of replayability may put some people off, as might the shortness of the game, but I personally feel that the game didn't overstay its welcome and its great storytelling more than makes up for the lack of replay value.\n\nThomas Was Alone was provided for review by Indie City","December 19, 2013","true","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This review was originally written for the now-dead indietheory.com before the game was released on Steam, thus the low play time on Steam for the game.\n\nThomas was alone. Wow. A weird first thought to have.\n\nSomething has gone wrong and the AI have become self-aware in the system. It's now your role to take these AI to a life they've never known; one up, and to the left.\n\nAlthough the game has a very simple design to it, with every playable character just a different sized square or rectangle of a different colour, and the platforms just blackness in front of the background, it manages to create its own unique art style that is a pleasure to look at. The characters also always stand out from the background vividly, with the platforms also standing out well against the background. Thus meaning there is never any confusion of what is a platform and what isn't.\n\nAlthough the graphical style creates some of the mood, it has to be said that the sound is a very large part of it. Firstly, there is David Housden's soundtrack. Just classical enough to add some emotion to the game, while also adding in enough electronic elements to fit in with the plot of AI escaping a system. Although one track is looped throughout each stage of ten levels, this is hardly noticeable with the music managing to stay on-theme.\n\nThen there is also the narration throughout from Danny Wallace, which creates a voice for each character. It means the game is given a plot and each character a personality, resulting in that you start to care for each little square and rectangle. Without this narration, the game would just be a decent looking platformer with a good soundtrack. It'd still be a fine game, but this manages to take it that one step further and develops a story in which you want to know what happens next.\n\nAs for the platforming action itself, it's hardly the most advanced you'll find in a game, but it works and it works well. You can control one character on the screen at a time, with each character slightly different from each other. One might be taller and thus be able to jump higher, another will be smaller and be able to fit in small spaces, while a couple even float in water and allow others to bounce on top of them. This means that each one's strengths have to be used to get others to the finish. Two could form steps to help a smaller character to a higher place it can't reach through jumping, for example.\n\nThis is one of the finest all-round games I have played in quite some time and as such can not recommended enough by me. The platforming works perfectly, the different characters add variety to the gameplay, and the soundtrack and narration sets the mood for the game, managing to make you care for what are after all "just" quadrilateral shapes. The lack of replayability may put some people off, as might the shortness of the game, but I personally feel that the game didn't overstay its welcome and its great storytelling more than makes up for the lack of replay value.\n\nThomas Was Alone was provided for review by Indie City","December 19, 2013","true","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But before I start gushing over this wondrous title, allow me to provide a little background. Thomas Was Alone (hereafter simply called “Thomas”) was single-handedly developed and published by Mike Bithell. On the surface, it appears to be nothing more than your typical platformer, tasking the player with moving some character(s) from one location to another. Witnessing such a simple concept blossom into a work of art is something that can only be experienced by actually playing the game. And while mere words are not enough to convey its artistic merit, I will still try my best.\n\nThomas doesn’t try to be something it is not. There are no cinematic cutscenes, no fancy special effects, and no intricate artwork. It offers only the bare necessities it needs to tell its story. Playable characters are nothing more than squares distinguished by varying sizes and colors, but the surprise here is just how much depth these blocks of pixels have. Each square is characterized by their own personal concerns, be it their fear of loneliness or their constant need for attention. You’ll find yourself growing emotionally attached to these two-dimensional blocks upon realizing how accurate they are as reflections of the internal turmoil regular people, like you and me, face daily. Fortunately, Thomas doesn’t drown its players with feelings of pessimism and hopelessness. Quite the opposite, Bithell uses his characters to show how much they rely on each other in order to thrive. At the end of the day, this here is a tale of triumph over adversity through courage and teamwork.\n\nHowever, Thomas’ minimalism isn’t its crowning achievement, but its unforgettable narration and soundtrack. British humorist Danny Wallace lends his rich and soothing voice to the opening of each level, commenting on the protagonists’ mental state and their current predicament. It is a brilliant mechanism to drive the plot forward without interfering with the flow of gameplay. But the cherry on top that ties the whole emotional package together is the music composed with 8-bit sounds layered upon a melodic piano track. It is one of the few soundtracks to have ever tugged on my heartstrings and that, my friends, is a feat worth mentioning.\n\nIronically, it is Thomas’ strongest quality that also holds it back from being the “perfect” game. The levels, of which there are about a hundred, are not at all challenging and many players should be able to breeze through the entire game in three hours or so. The narrative also takes a dive in quality around the halfway mark, when an entirely new cast of squares is introduced. The poor characterization of these new protagonists may have been forgivable had we been given the opportunity to revisit the lovable blocks we fell in love with in the first half of the game, but alas, they are quietly swept under the rug. But above all, it was a single technical problem that tainted the experience for me. As players are given access to more and more characters, navigating between them became more and more unwieldy. Instead of mapping each of them to a number key, the player must select his desired character by first parsing through the preceding ones. This cumbersome approach can be time consuming, particularly when six or more blocks are at your command.\n\nWithout the financial support of a big company, independent developers have always been ones forced to innovate, finding shortcuts that are beneficial to them without detracting from the quality of their work. What Bithell has done here is nothing short of brilliant, taking numerous familiar elements and packaging them into what I can only describe as a work of art. In an era where we are surrounded by big budget games that rival the quality of most action-packed movies, it feels nice to just sit back once in a while and enjoy something reminiscent of simpler times.\n\nGrade: 4/5","July 3, 2013","true","3.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

As far as puzzle platformers go, this one is entertaining and has some fun mechanics, but it's not overly challenging (I generally like my puzzle games infuriating). However, the game more than makes up for it with a simple but engaging story told with equally engaging narration that kept me giggling pretty much through the whole thing.

Gameplay here is the standard puzzle platforming affair with puzzles that strike a nice balance between being challenging enough to be interesting but not so hard you'll be stuck for hours. The controls are tight and responsive, leaving the player in full control and never causing any unfair deaths. However it's the presentation that you'll most remember about Thomas Was Alone. Throughout each level there's small accompanying narration by UK comedian Danny Wallace, this narration is what gives the game it's unique charm that isn't often seen in games managing to be both heartfelt and witty on numerous occasion. It's with this narration that makes each block have their own distinct personalities and actually makes you empathise with them on occasion. Also the audio presentation is outstanding with some wonderful melodies that lull the player into a calming soulful mental state. All in all if you're looking for a puzzle platformer that offers a charming and whimsical style in conjuction with solid game mechanics then you won't find much better than Thomas Was Alone.","June 4, 2013","true","4.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Some can jump higher, others can float in (the normally deadly) water, some pretty much just act as a stepping stone so that their higher-jumping buddies can reach a switch (and that's ok!) - using all of their talents together, you must move them from their starting location(s) to their goals (outlines that look like the character.)\n\nWhat really brings the game together is the excellent narration and minimalist (but perfectly done) music - despite the characters being (literally) squares and rectangles, you really get a feeling for each character's personality, and (dare I say it) you even begin to care about them and their journey.\n\nI wouldn't go so far as to say that it's a buy at its normal $10 price-point, as it's fairly short (I completed it in ~4 hours), but if you can find it either in a bundle or at a high discount, it's well worth picking up.","September 7, 2014","true","3.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Your experience with it as a game is perfectly aligned, casual if you will. Its a puzzle game that makes you think in various new ways but it never reaches the point where you'd quit the game out of frustration. An innovative puzzle, requiring you to juggle your characters around willy nilly, but you don't get frustrated from making mistakes, as the game is the least punishable it can be. Solving puzzles gives you the sweet reward of continuing the storyline.\n\nSo, the storyline. You wouldn't think a game about AI representative rectangles in a rectangular black world would be interesting. But each character is introduced in their own perspective, and as you progress you get a nice view of everyone from each angle. Every character is entirely unique, and resembles a unique aspect of human behavior. Its truly a marvel to behold. A slight warning, though, the plot - considering action sequences - is not that deep, I'd rather call the plot an emotional advance.\n\nIf you haven't bought this game yet, but can find a lot of pleasure in a cute little puzzle game with a touching story don't hesitate.","October 25, 2015","true","8.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The graphics are really simple but it is pretty fun to play and the narration in the background serves to put some story on top of everything you are doing.  Basically you find different "blocks" as you go through the game and each one has different abilites like jumping higher, being able to go in water, etc.  You have to use all your different block things together to solve puzzles and move each block to its respective exit portal on each level.  Overall its pretty fun and you can get this game for like 1$ in an indie bundle so i'd definetly recommend it for that price to give you around 3 or so hours of entertainment.","June 4, 2013","true","2.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The graphics even though simple create good-looking environments with not-so-basic lighting effects and pixel graphics. The story has a simple premise to it, but the narration is quite long and full of humour and references to popular memes - it accompanies the player throughout each level, revealing bits and pieces of the story every couple steps. The narrator's voice fits well too - a clear smooth voice that doesn't get annoying or boring and just feels right.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=111330936\n\nGameplay in Thomas was Alone is simple as well, the aim of each level is to get all characters from their starting positions to their respective exit portals. This is made somewhat more challenging by the tricky level design and the fact that every character has different movement abilities or skills. Completing levels requires "cooperation" between the different characters, a little clever thinking, and *A LOT* of switching between characters.\n\nNevertheless, the game is still quite easy overall and doesn't take too long to finish, approx. 3 hours on average. At $10/L6 the game may seem a bit pricey for a mere 3 hours, but it's well worth picking up at the nearest sale. I quite enjoyed the overall experience and can certainly recommend it to anyone looking for a short, enjoyable adventure.\n\nEdit: It's worth adding the game is fully controller-compatible, and actually plays very well using a controller.","February 27, 2014","true","2.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The quirky story of a number of wild bits struggling to gain some sort of life, to gain an understanding of their world, and maybe make things better.  The story is light, but touches on many subjects, such as loneliness, abandonment, self-confidence, narcissism, and inferiority. It's told in a very dry but witty sort of narative (it felt very British to me, in a good way), with each character having a very distinct personality and view point. The final chapter is a fairly exciting, in a ponderous sort of way, and very touching piece, given everything you had to do to get there. Story is the king of this game.\n\nThe graphics are simple, but effective, the playing control fairly solid, and the music is pretty good, as well. The puzzles aren't particularly hard, and some can be frustrating due to duration, more than challenge, but over all not a bad sense of mastery by the end. It is, however, fairly short. There are trinkets to be gained...but they are mostly very easy to find, and I ended up getting all but 2 on my first play through.

Some use mind-bending puzzles, beautiful visuals, or an overly complicated story to try and turn themselves into more than just boring puzzle games. In reality, all that you need to make a good puzzle platformer is a basic story and interesting mechanics. Thomas Was Alone gets these two elements exactly right. I didn't expect there to be much of a story about the protagonist quadilaterals and was surprised at how engaging the narration style actually was. The puzzles are a joy to play through because the minamalist visual style and beautiful music make it a relaxed, fun experience. TWA doesn't force you to land dozens of unforgiving jumps or solve puzzles under time pressure. The puzzles are well-balanced: not too hard, but requiring some thought.

Let's start with the music. David Housden did a fantastic job with the soundtrack. I am a sucker for a good soundtrack. I love how characters that are nothing but a square or rectangle are more than just that. They have unique mindsets, personalities, and ablilities. The gameplay is enjoyable, but pretty easy. Levels towards the end can be hard enough to make you google how to get past the level. Overall, the gameplay has easy mechanics, good for all types of gamers, and is very enjoyable. The narrator adds so much to the story. He is funny and witty, just like the narrator of 'The Stanley Parable' he has quotes such as "Thomas knew he'd never meet Nathan Fillion, or a transformer. He'd never visit Gotham city or eat at Mooby's. It didn't matter. If he and his friends jumped into the creation matrix, they could give everyone else in the simulation a chance to." or "Thomas was connected to the internet for 12 seconds. And he had seen everything. He had seen the cats who couldn't spell, he had heard of the arrow through the knee. He felt that there was a thing called cake, but that it was a lie" The game is all about friendship, sacrafice, and betrayal. It explores the natures that make up who we are.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/soul23plane/recommended/220780/","soul23plane","sOU\_","http://steamcommunity.com/id/soul23plane/","529 products in account","On a lazy Sunday afternoon, I decided to go through my Steam library and play some games I haven't played yet. The first game that got me interested was "Thomas Was Alone". I've heard and read from the internet that it's a pretty awesome indie game. So then I decided to download and installed it.\n\nAfter I played it, the internet was right! (again)\n\nWho would have tought that a game this simple could touch your heart and make us feel warm inside? If you look at the game's graphics and gameplay mechanics, Thomas Was Alone is a pretty damn simple game. It is just a simple puzzle platformer with boxes with different shapes and colours as the characters that we control!\n\nBut what makes Thomas Was Alone interesting, touching, and makes us wanting more is the glorious story narration and music. Props to the narrator, Danny Wallace, for bringing such a great story narration and making the characters (boxes) feel alive. The music is gorgeus and feels right in each moment of the game. Because of this narration and music combination, I feel like I was emotionally attached with the characters, which is once again, boxes.\n\nThe only (tiny) negative I can give for this game is the level design. Halfway through the game, I feel bored with some of the levels. But the positives kept me playing.\n\nSo if you have some time to spare, try Thomas Was Alone. Worth your time.","January 26, 2014","true","4.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The music made me feel sad and happy and was pretty well done. I had to turn the BGM down, however, in the settings just a tad because at some ponts it was hard to hear the narrator (who was great).\n\nThere was something about this game that made me want to keep playing through the 100 levels. Each level was pretty quick and the game itself is very short.\n\nThe score of 77 which Metacritic gave it is very accurate.\n\nAt the time of this review, the game was 9.99USD. I played it recently because it became part of my "Instant Game Collection" on my PS3/PS Vita. If I were to buy this now, I'd be very happy paying $5 - $7 but $10 is completely fine.\n\nEnjoy!","April 10, 2014","true","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Some can jump higher, others can float in (the normally deadly) water, some pretty much just act as a stepping stone so that their higher-jumping buddies can reach a switch (and that's ok!) - using all of their talents together, you must move them from their starting location(s) to their goals (outlines that look like the character.)\n\nWhat really brings the game together is the excellent narration and minimalist (but perfectly done) music - despite the characters being (literally) squares and rectangles, you really get a feeling for each character's personality, and (dare I say it) you even begin to care about them and their journey.\n\nI wouldn't go so far as to say that it's a buy at its normal $10 price-point, as it's fairly short (I completed it in ~4 hours), but if you can find it either in a bundle or at a high discount, it's well worth picking up.","September 7, 2014","true","3.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In fact, I would argue that the characters in this game (whom are just shapes) have better defined personalities and more interesting developments than characters in the vast majority of AAA titles.\n\nAt its core, Thomas Was Alone is a puzzle/platformer game in which you control different characters as you make your way to the end of each one of the 100 levels included. I never felt that the puzzles were particularly hard, but they did introduce a lot of variety, which was welcomed. The most interesting thing about the game however, is the wonderful narration and how efficient it is in making you feel involved in Thomas' world and the plight he goes through.\n\nIf you are interested in a simple but deep game that will stay with you long after the 3-4 hours it takes you to beat it, look no further than this game.

The graphics are really simple but it is pretty fun to play and the narration in the background serves to put some story on top of everything you are doing.  Basically you find different "blocks" as you go through the game and each one has different abilites like jumping higher, being able to go in water, etc.  You have to use all your different block things together to solve puzzles and move each block to its respective exit portal on each level.  Overall its pretty fun and you can get this game for like 1$ in an indie bundle so i'd definetly recommend it for that price to give you around 3 or so hours of entertainment.","June 4, 2013","true","2.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Using nothing more than a charming British narrator and a couple of pixels and light shaders, Thomas Was Alone manages to imbue what at first seem to be nothing more than rectangles and squares with personalities, quirks, and faults. You begin to care about the little red rectangle that is Thomas throughout his journey. The game is long enough to get invested in, but not so much that you still can't beat it in a day. By the time you realize what is happening around Thomas and his friends, your heart will have already been won and cheering them on.\n\nIn addition, the Benjamin's Flight missions are a charming addition to the tiny little world of Thomas Was Alone. It even manages a send-up (or sorts) of Flappy Bird which proves that it could have much more depth than it did. The DLC is a bit more challenging than the main game, but it is still worth a shot.\n\n10/10","June 27, 2014","true","7.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In fact, I would argue that the characters in this game (whom are just shapes) have better defined personalities and more interesting developments than characters in the vast majority of AAA titles.\n\nAt its core, Thomas Was Alone is a puzzle/platformer game in which you control different characters as you make your way to the end of each one of the 100 levels included. I never felt that the puzzles were particularly hard, but they did introduce a lot of variety, which was welcomed. The most interesting thing about the game however, is the wonderful narration and how efficient it is in making you feel involved in Thomas' world and the plight he goes through.\n\nIf you are interested in a simple but deep game that will stay with you long after the 3-4 hours it takes you to beat it, look no further than this game.

Buying this game supports the clever, innovative mind of a single specific person, Mike Bithell.  I remember when I first started playing, I tweeted the developer that the game was super enjoyable.  Months later I returned and finished the story over a few quiet evenings.  So engaging, so rewarding.  This feels like gaming in a futuristic society where leisure time is abundant and gaming is widespread as a form of education and stimulation, instead of just addictive.  As the game progresses your mental labels of the various rectangles stops being their color or their size, and you start to identify them by name.  The game doesn't force that anthropormophization, but it's so much richer for it.  Similarly, you couldn't just listen to the narration without the context of the game and understand the story, it's a journey you take together.

I found myself trying to edge out a few pixels here and there in a balancing act several times, to only find myself dismayed when my building blocks toppled over.\n\nOther small gripes;\n-It would sometimes display inconsistent behaviors for the blocks while on moving platforms.\n\n-There were also a few missed opportunities to place a new hidden items.\nSuch as the area where the water spills out of in 3.9. I found that you could jump blocks off other blocks while they were in midair. Shame that there wasn’t anything hidden there.\n\n-Weird design choice for the game physics\nYou'll see this most apparent in 4.8 and 4.10, the way jump works is you stop dead in mid air if you aren't physically controlling the block.

You will lose all forward momentum.\n\nBut what makes this game interesting is to see how narration ties in with your gameplay.\nWhether if it the narrator pointing out things you might overlook, or just help change your view on your actions when personify the objects.\n\nThough there isn't a lot of dialog in the game, I couldn't help but imagine some while playing.\nClaire: ‘Don’t drown little guy, I’ll catch you if you fall!’\nChris: 'I don't need you, I can do this alone.'","May 19, 2014","true","2.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The player is introduced to a number of 2d quadrilaterals, all with their own unique skillsets.  What's truly unique about this game is that it manages to make the player legitimately care about a story that is being told through colorful squares and rectangles.  Thomas Was Alone is a platforming game with character and amazing narration.  Highly reccomend.","July 14, 2013","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The screenshots do not do it justice.\n\nThe story follows the representation of AIs (seen as different types of quadrilateral) as they attempt to navigate their digital sorroundings. I think this does a really good job of showing how (non-murderous) AIs would react if they were ever created.\n\nThe puzzles and different abilities of the AIs make for some really interesting puzzles. They're not too overly difficult.\n\nThis game can be played with keyboard or controller. I played with a controller, and this worked great. Note: You need to have the controller turned on before you start the game, you can' just switch to it in-game.\n\nThe graphics are very simple in this game, and very minimalistic, and it looks great.\n\nThe soundtrack in this game is beautiful. Nothing more can be said. The game also makes use of narration to tell the story, which is a really good way of doing things.\n\nDefinitely get this game if you like platformer puzzles.","June 22, 2014","true","6.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I had no expectations apart for hoping it would be worth what I paid. And, well, I should have bought it full price. It is a casual platformer with many gameplay mechanics, each block/character has one. There are 7 basic, then 4 more that can pick up various skills. Also now the Icarus expansion is part of the game (for free) which means 3 more characters. While the game is not particularly chellenging it is most definitely fun to play.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gooptyking/recommended/220780/","gooptyking","THeFraz 199","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gooptyking/","187 products in account","Thomas Was Alone is a minimalist puzzle platformer. You play as several rectangles/squares, each with different names and varying personalities. After a serendipitous fluke, an A.I. named Thomas is created. He decides he wants to learn about the world, and as his adventure goes on, he meets other A.I.s. When people talk about fusing narrative with gameplay, TWA is a great example of this. All of the characters abilities and (limited) appearances reflect their personalities and their motives. For some strange reason, I became emotionally invested with these simple geometric shapes. There are even some tear-jerker moments strewn throughout, which delightfully caught me by surprise. The writing (all of it narrated, reminiscent of the Stanley Parable... the mod came out before) for them is very comedic and charming, making you want to keep seeing these shapes interact and finish their goals. I would like to say more about the narrative and characters, but anything is really a spoiler, and it is better to experience it without any prior knowledge.\n\nThe presentation for the game is quite pretty actually. Like I've said, the art style is minimal, but it doesn't make the game look boring. The lighting effects look nice while the squares slide through the environment, and their pastel colors contrast the stark black obstacles and the shaded background. It shows they have life in the dead computer world they inhabit.\n\nAlong with the art style is the soundtrack. The songs consist usually of violins, piano, and a reoccuring electronic melody. It is gorgeous, and really enhances the emotional impact of the more melancholic levels. One of my favorite pieces included ascending guitar tremolo, very similar to popular post-rock sounds (Sigur Ros, Godspeed You! Black Emperor). It just heightened everything I was feeling so much, that it is one of the most memorable gaming moments I have had yet.\n\nHowever, the game isn't perfect. The thing is, the game really leaves you wanting more with the characters. A narration only happens twice (I might be wrong on that, but I'm pretty sure) within a stage, so it is very limiting to how much anyone can talk. The game is quite short, taking four hours and 100 stages, leaving only (approximately) 200 bits of dialogue.\n\nThe biggest problem with the game is the puzzles. I think "puzzles" is the wrong term for what you navigate in the game. They are more akin to obstacle courses, where you have to avoid spikes or hot water, and have to use teamwork between the squares to press buttons, make jumps, and get to each shape's respective portal. These obstacle courses leave much to be desired. Sure, the ones in the game already do make the characters seem to have a better connection when they have to help each other finish a stage. If there was more challenge to finishing a stage, they would seem more dependent with each other's help, and the catharsis of completing a hard puzzle would be like a high-five moment between them.\n\nThomas Was Alone is an interesting gem. I found its story/characters just as interesting as bigger indies like Braid and Bastion, but it lacks in the overall gameplay department. I can see this being a staple for my future children, as it is simple enough for them to play, and has a light-hearted atmosphere with some poignantly sad moments sprinkled throughout to (hopefully) keep it memorable for them. Thomas Was Alone definitely is for me.","January 27, 2014","true","4.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The Stanley Parable-esque narration gives Thomas and the gang a surprising amount of personality for who are essentially just an assemblage of colored squares and rectangles, and there is definetly a laugh or two to be had from their verbal antics, but as far as the gameplay is concerned, Thomas Was Alone does little to differentiate itself from the crowd. There are plenty of other games that have done better platforming and better storytelling, but very few have managed to combine these elements in such a unique way. This alone is enough to give the game a significant advantage over most other minimalist indie platformers, but if all you care for is gameplay, then you'll still have fun 3-4 hours of puzzle/platforming goodness, even if you've already done it a hundred times before in other games.","May 9, 2014","true","3.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Well i came into this game after seeing positive reviews, so i thought it would be cool.... I was amazed this is a game where you feel genuine attachment to the shapes that are its characters because of brilliant naration wonderful music . Gameplay wise it wasnt the most challenging puzzle game but it made you think and the level of difficulty fit so that you were never annoyed and are able to happily enjoy the atmosphere its a shame that there was only around 4 hours of gameplay but it felt like it was enough.\n\nSo should you buy it? I would say yes, and if its on sale then ABSOLUTELY, it was easily worth 6 quid purely in terms of of the atmosphere and left me wanting to write a review which I almost never do straight afterwards.","December 27, 2014","true","9.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

For me, though, it really worked. The mechanics are introduced gently, and more importantly, as plot points. The story is simple but involving, and often adorable. Though the puzzles were rarely too challenging, the basic setup of the game changed often enough to keep things new, and these changes dovetailed beautifully with the plot itself.\n\n[Emotional spoilers, but not actual spoilers:] Though the ending might have been a let-down at the end of a long game whose story you were very invested in, in this setup, it worked perfectly.\n\nBeing fond of mathematics, I cannot pretend this is the first time I have cared about simple geometric shapes; however, it is the first time I have been truly invested in their dreams.","June 29, 2014","true","29.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(Idiot :P) Also, you should subtract about 80-90 hours for my real play-time. I left it on for four days.\n\nStoryThis one's story is much better than it may seem. It has a good explanation for everything, and has a really intriguing-thought-provoking-setting. Though it leaves much of it up to your imagination with the gaps in the story, (Darn that open ending! :P) it truly is a good story that is well intertwined with the game. Also, how the heck did they manage to get ME attached to rectangles?! I never get attached to anyone in games! I am heartbroken when they fall into the water! If you want a better story, play an actual story/adventure/whateverYouCallIt game.\nStory: 9/10\n\nPuzzle difficultyMany of it is unusual thinking, but requires alot of the same technique. I won't say it's mundane, but a third-grader could complete it with some time and effort. It introduces a drastically new element with every character, so the game never really got dull. One downside is the length. Seems a little longer than about two flash games put together. Don't get me wrong, this game is 10000 times better than any puzzle flash game, but it's really too short. I beat it in about 3-5 hours. The final dissapointing thing: on alot of levels, you could rush in and guess at what to do until you found it. I was never really truly puzzled by something for more than a minute.\nPuzzle:7.5/10\n\nReplayabilityVirtually none. If you found out late that those floating squares were achievements, you could go back for them... There is a charm to the characters, I would have no problem experiencing my favorites again... But really, there's not much to do once you've completed it. This game burns fast and bright.\nReplayability:7/10\n\nOverallThis game was great, but as mentioned above, it burns fast and bright.

The characters themselves have great characterisation and interesting individual mechanics, but the game has a habit of making you do the exact same thing three or more times in a row. Form a staircase for Chris with John and Thomas to help him up the ledge. Now do it again. And again. Don't worry, we'll come back to it in later levels.\n\nI'll put the conclusion here for those who wish to avoid spoilers. Overall, I'd say that the platforming is just interesting enough to warrant a purchase, though maybe wait until the game is on sale. The first few chapters feel rather bland, but when introduced to characters like Laura, James and Sarah, it really begins to shine. The story, though not compelling and with its issues, is worth paying attention to.\n\n***SPOILERS FROM BELOW***\n\nI also feel like the "feels trip" is somewhat overrated. The fact that the story of the main characters concludes after the first seven chapters or so is somewhat confusing, especially given the fact that we are then immediately introduced to a set of new characters who aren't given enough time to establish a connection with the player. A villain is introduced towards the very end of the game and dealt with rather anticlimactically. To top it off, the final cinematic of the game just shows computer screens turning white, before jumping immediately into credits, a very unsatisfactory conclusion.","July 12, 2015","true","4.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Wrap it all in well designed levels and cover it in a great simple UI and you have everything a well designed game should be.\n\nHighlights\nThe fun, character and world building narrative is the main thing that brings this game to life, but it wouldn't be for naught if the gameplay wasn't also so polished and solid. Great game design exists in every facet of this game.\n\n* Great ambient music and sound artefacts that, when combined with other elements, create some genuinely tense moments\n* Fantastic simple UI and controls that always feel light and reactive\n* Light but intelligent humour\n\nMistakes\nNot a single one. Everything is well made and comes together to make a great, fun experience. Anything I could point out that isn't perfect about this game is simply nitpicking, but for the sake of completeness it's worth mentioning that some may find the game stale, repetitive or unchallenging at times if they don't like the narration and tone. It's also fairly short and despite some good accomplishment based achievements for completionists, it doesn't have a strong amount of re-playability.\n\nRecommendations\nThomas Was Alone is fairly short, and clocks in at about 4 hours of gameplay, but it's worth another play or two a few years down the line, and has some good achievements. It's priced at £5.99/7.99€/$9.99 which is fair for such a well put together product, but may feel overpriced for the game length. It regularly goes on sale for -75% and occasionally even less.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/220780","June 22, 2015","true","5.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CosmicAlian/recommended/220780/","CosmicAlian","CosmicAlian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CosmicAlian/","224 products in account","The game is pretty and quite fun. But sometimes the controls might not respond (for me, thomas and other thin blocks felt like they had a delay from press to jump which made each obsticle more aggrevating).\n\nThe level design is really good for the most part. Each level had its own challange that you had to over come. But sometimes the levels would be intentionally made to make you rage. There were multiple times that the game would put the same jump three times in a row. this is no problem with playform jumps where you just jump forward but become long and tedious when you have to somehow get the small square block, chris, across by having him jump on thomas, then onto james then thomas jumps on james and then lastly chris on thomas again so he can make the jump. this would be fine to figure out once but this specific jump was done in multiple levels and multiple times per level, one after another. In later stages, not making the final jump caused you to have to repeat each and every previous jump from before. This quassi-difficulty increase makes the game stale and hard to binge on for a long time as you will fail and get punished often.\n\nThe controls are fiddly aswell. there are sometimes more than 5 characters to control and you can't navigate using number keys which makes the camera jump often which gets frustrating after a while. Speaking of the camera, the camera itself feels sluggish. It was programed to move smoothly and fluidly while tracking your character which is fine when you're walking in a line but becomes annoying when you jump and have to let the camera catch up.\n\nBut overall the game is great. I love the small maps with a few characters on them as it bypasses the flaws. I love the character diversity, they really thought of everything that could be done in a 2D space. The narrator is a fantastic idea although his speaches would often be at the worst times. Sometimes he spoke at the beginning which is fine, sometimes at a check point where if you died he would repeat himself which gets annoying to hear. And sometimes he would just say a paragraph right when you exit the level, and CAN'T redo the previous level without restarting the chapter, so you leave before he finishes.","July 12, 2015","true","5.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

They are an experience.  The combination of the soothing soundtrack and fantastic story with terrific narration gives you a game you can just get lost in.  The platforming puzzles are challenging at times but aren't aggravatingly hard.  Even though it is relatively short the story is great and somehow makes you have compassion for pixels on your screen.  This is by far one of my most memorable experiences in gaming.  Oh, and I recently just picked it up again because the devs added FREE DLC.  Amazing game, soundtrack, narrration, and terrific devs.  What are you waiting for?

The fact that the characters are just colored figures, yet still relatable enough to worry about them is proof of this.\nHowever, we're not told everything about the story; the quotes at the start of each chapter point out to something more out there, and the ending is rather ambiguous. But this just gives the game a sense of being much greater, of that what we're doing has the possibility of affecting the world without actually pointing out we're doing so.\nPlus we have a british guy narrating the story.\nThe only con, I would have to say, is that the game is a bit too short.\nBut at the end Thomas Was Alone is a small masterpiece that showcases a perfect mix between a deep story and fun gameplay.","June 22, 2015","true","4.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's complex in its simplicity. You play as a variety of blocks, each with different abilities and weaknesses. You must make your little quadrilaterals work together as a team to reach the end of each level, utilizing their talents along the way. Add to it great dialogue and atmopsheric music, and you've got a really fun game. It's not terribly long, maybe a few hours, but it's worth it. The levels start off easier but get pretty crazy once you start combining double jumps, reversed gravity, a trampoline and switches to swap between various abilitites.\n\nMy only con: The music is great, but sometimes it seemed really dissonant, like there were two different tracks playing on top of each other in different keys. I don't know if this was intentional to set a mood or just some glitch that makes the music hang over from level to level.\n\nI've never cared so much about a bunch of quadrilaterals before in my life.","December 30, 2015","true","5.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'd like to point out that the narrator did a phonomenal job fleshing out each of the characters. The levels are nothing short of what you would expect for a platformer, in fact I'd say its better. It's a relatively short experience and replayability may vary depending on whether you are a fan of platformers.  If it's on sale, BUY IT!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drakewastaken/recommended/220780/","drakewastaken","drake","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drakewastaken/","119 products in account","Thomas Was Alone is an incredible game.  I'm sure just about everyone that has completed the game would say the same.  The music is fantastic, the background animations are beautiful yet subtle enough to keep the focus on the game, the gameplay is relaxing, and Danny Wallace's voice acting was nothing short of perfection.  And to top it all off, the story is amazing.\n\nHowever, no game is perfect, and I'd prefer not to treat any game as such.  Below this is the few flaws I have with the game, but I am putting it in spoiler text for two important reasons.  The first is that I honestly feel like if someone is looking to buy this game, they should not know about these flaws.  As silly as it sounds, the flaws are not nearly as large as one must portray through text, and I feel like the flaws would stand out more and be more of an annoyance for someone that knew about them beforehand.  The second reason is that it contains actual spoilers.\n\nWith all that being said, if you are looking to buy this game, stop reading and buy it already.  The story will move you and you will not regret the purchase.\n\nContinuation below:\n\nAlright, so as incredible as the game is, there were two flaws that slightly bother me looking back.  The first and largest complaint for me would be that there were simply too many main characters in the story.  Personally, I think that The Architects (Thomas, Chris, John, Claire, Laura, James, Sarah) should have been the only playable characters in the game.  The storyline simply became too complicated once The Second Generation AIs (Grey, Sam, Jo, Paul, Team Jump) entered the narrative.  Twelve main characters is a LOT, and it's simply too many for a rather short story like this one.  The Architects were all captivating characters with great personalities, and I think that if Mike Bithell decided to expand on those characters rather than introduce five brand new ones towards the end of the story, it would have been better.\n\nSecondly, I wish that as the game progressed, they decided to ramp up on the difficulty in terms of puzzles rather than in platforming.  That's hard to say considering the thousands of hours I've put into countless platformers, but I feel like there was more room for expansion in the puzzle aspect of the game than in the platforming aspect.  The skill in the late game was based off of your ability to micro-manage all of the characters, and if you screwed it up you would have to do a significant portion, or possibly all of it over again.  I guess your ability to micro-manage is puzzle based, but it's very linear.  There simply isn't much room for expansion in that skill set.  While Bithell did experiment in other puzzle aspects, the clear focus was the ability to micro-manage and I feel like that was not the best decision.\n\nHowever, these two issues barely dent this game's integrity and I would still absolutely recommend it to anyone and everyone.\n\nOverall, 9/10","April 15","true","5.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrimordialHelios/recommended/220780/","PrimordialHelios","Bubsy the Cat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrimordialHelios/","42 products in account","I'll start this review by saying the Linux (Ubuntu 14.4, Ubuntu kernel 4.5 Wily, most recent stable version) version of this is plagued with bugs. about a quarter of a second of input lag, screen tearing, music plays even when muted, audio stuttering, windowed mode barely works, and I can't adjust the resolution.\nI occasionally have audio stuttering on certain ALSA applications, so there is a chance that's what's causing the audio to stutter.\n\nThe story isn't the best. You play as multiple different cubes and rectangles of different sizes. These characters are actually AI who have become sentient, and are trying to escape deletion. The story is cute, but forgettable, and it certainly isn't bad.\n\nThe graphics are actually really nice in my opinion. While they aren't supre impressive, they look great. The mix of mainly squareish geometry, water, and lighting system work together really really well and everything just looks beautiful. Even with the screen tearing I experienced, I barely noticed and didn't care, I just loved how everything looked.\n\nThe platforming and puzzles in the game are great, as long as you don't have input lag. If you do, kiss any notion of precision and fluidity goodbye, and you may as well just delete the game from your computer unless you REALLY want the achievements.\nSpeaking of achievements, they aren't hard to get. Find special items in certain levels, and basically just beat the game and you'll 100% it.\n\nIf you've got a Mac or a Windows machine, I definitely encourage you to pick this up, especiall if it goes on sale. Just be wary of the Linux version.","March 25","true","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/brunc/recommended/220780/","brunc","bruno-C-<3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/brunc/","1940 products in account","Thomas Was Alone\n\nThis game, the first time I saw it, I tought, it'll be more of those plataform games where you need to solve some puzzles. But no, the game really have a story. It starts just with Thomas (alone, of course), that is a rectangle, and meets some new friends (shapes), six total at the main story, and they start to help each other to solve the puzzles and they kinda create a gang, group of friends, and there are some relations between some of the characters, and all of this is awesome.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe puzzles in the game are actually pretty standart, but the coop aspect with the Thomas' friends are amazing. You need to think like they were one individual. And you discover more of the story, more you play, so, I think it's pretty simple to understand the mechanics and what you can do and what you can't with each character (like height jump, special abilities). Generally, it's a game to appreciate, and separate some time to spend in, because it'll give you good smiles, laughs and you will feel relaxed.\n\nPros and Cons\n\nPros\n\n- It's relaxing.\n- It's simple.\n- It's very very funny!\n\nCons\n\n- None! :)\n\n\nConclusion\n\nYou should definitely buy this game if you have the money. It's terrific if you consider what you paid. The peace you experience with Thomas Was Alone is absolutely incredible, the game immerses you with Thomas and his friends and you can't stop playing. If you like the genre, like some good puzzles, not hard at all, buy it no fear, trust me. Therefore, I really recommend Thomas Was Alone to your library. Enjoy it as soon as you can!","January 9","true","4.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The characters are easy to get a handle of.\n\nThe gameplay could use some work. Also, there be bugs. The music will sometimes forget to stop, so then two soundtracks will play. Sometimes, it takes me a while to realize, and I have to restart my game and go through the intro again, which was annoying, so I could get the right soundtrack. For all I know, there were some levels where I played with the wrong music or some levels that were meant to be silent and I just never knew.\n\nI saw a negative review that thought that this was done on purpose, which was funny. But it makes sense. There's no way you'd know that it was a bug and would think to restart your game. Not even sure how I came to that conclusion.\n\nThe gameplay controls were slightly frustrating, but not at all crippling. You could use numbers to switch between the characters, but the numbers would randomly change level to level at times, so you couldn't just associate a color with some numbers. That was annoying, And later, you come across characters that are the same color, so you can't even associate them with a number. You just have to keep switching until you reach the character you want. Again, only slightly annoying, not crippling.\n\nThe gameplay was very much purely a platformer. The puzzles could be solved at first glance most of the time, sometimes with a bit of experimentation here and there. There were a few moments when it got slightly frustrating. Personally, I didn't find this gameplay all too exhilirating, but I didn't find it boring. It fit in nicely with everything else.\n\nThe dialogue is very witty, and I found myself very eager to get some dialogue or the quotes that they'd have, implying other plot points.\n\nIn summation,\n\nPROS\n\n-Calm, minimalistic gameplay\n-Heartwarming story and dialogue\n-Funny and witty story and dialogue\n-Well written and complementing characters\n-Incredibly easy to listen to music (though, you can turn it off if you'd like)\n\nCONS\n-Buggy (most noticeably (or least noticeably, which makes it more notable) with the music)\n-Can be a bit frustrating, slightly boring from time to time\n-The controls aren't as good or as consistent as I'd like\n\n\nEDIT: ALSO, I couldn't help but notice that now, it says this game is only for Windows and Mac. It's still in my Linux library, and I'm nearly certain it said it was available for Linux when I first got the game. Furthermore, I played the entire game on Linux and I can still open it.\n\nWhat the flippity what?","January 8, 2015","true","4.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(Idiot :P) Also, you should subtract about 80-90 hours for my real play-time. I left it on for four days.\n\nStoryThis one's story is much better than it may seem. It has a good explanation for everything, and has a really intriguing-thought-provoking-setting. Though it leaves much of it up to your imagination with the gaps in the story, (Darn that open ending! :P) it truly is a good story that is well intertwined with the game. Also, how the heck did they manage to get ME attached to rectangles?! I never get attached to anyone in games! I am heartbroken when they fall into the water! If you want a better story, play an actual story/adventure/whateverYouCallIt game.\nStory: 9/10\n\nPuzzle difficultyMany of it is unusual thinking, but requires alot of the same technique. I won't say it's mundane, but a third-grader could complete it with some time and effort. It introduces a drastically new element with every character, so the game never really got dull. One downside is the length. Seems a little longer than about two flash games put together. Don't get me wrong, this game is 10000 times better than any puzzle flash game, but it's really too short. I beat it in about 3-5 hours. The final dissapointing thing: on alot of levels, you could rush in and guess at what to do until you found it. I was never really truly puzzled by something for more than a minute.\nPuzzle:7.5/10\n\nReplayabilityVirtually none. If you found out late that those floating squares were achievements, you could go back for them... There is a charm to the characters, I would have no problem experiencing my favorites again... But really, there's not much to do once you've completed it. This game burns fast and bright.\nReplayability:7/10\n\nOverallThis game was great, but as mentioned above, it burns fast and bright. I recommend buying it on sale, as it DEFINITELY will be worth it then. Put together it was a decent, but not truly amazing puzzle game.\nOverall: 8/10","December 3, 2015","true","92.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I had no expectations apart for hoping it would be worth what I paid. And, well, I should have bought it full price. It is a casual platformer with many gameplay mechanics, each block/character has one. There are 7 basic, then 4 more that can pick up various skills. Also now the Icarus expansion is part of the game (for free) which means 3 more characters. While the game is not particularly chellenging it is most definitely fun to play.

I think this does a really good job of showing how (non-murderous) AIs would react if they were ever created.\n\nThe puzzles and different abilities of the AIs make for some really interesting puzzles. They're not too overly difficult.\n\nThis game can be played with keyboard or controller. I played with a controller, and this worked great. Note: You need to have the controller turned on before you start the game, you can' just switch to it in-game.\n\nThe graphics are very simple in this game, and very minimalistic, and it looks great.\n\nThe soundtrack in this game is beautiful.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kritigri/recommended/220780/","kritigri","Kritigri","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kritigri/","475 products in account","On the whole I recommend this game, but if I had to give it a rating out of ten, it'd sit squarely (ha) on six.\n\nThe reason for this is mostly the repetitiveness. The characters themselves have great characterisation and interesting individual mechanics, but the game has a habit of making you do the exact same thing three or more times in a row. Form a staircase for Chris with John and Thomas to help him up the ledge. Now do it again. And again. Don't worry, we'll come back to it in later levels.\n\nI'll put the conclusion here for those who wish to avoid spoilers. Overall, I'd say that the platforming is just interesting enough to warrant a purchase, though maybe wait until the game is on sale. The first few chapters feel rather bland, but when introduced to characters like Laura, James and Sarah, it really begins to shine. The story, though not compelling and with its issues, is worth paying attention to.\n\n***SPOILERS FROM BELOW***\n\nI also feel like the "feels trip" is somewhat overrated. The fact that the story of the main characters concludes after the first seven chapters or so is somewhat confusing, especially given the fact that we are then immediately introduced to a set of new characters who aren't given enough time to establish a connection with the player. A villain is introduced towards the very end of the game and dealt with rather anticlimactically. To top it off, the final cinematic of the game just shows computer screens turning white, before jumping immediately into credits, a very unsatisfactory conclusion.","July 12, 2015","true","4.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CosmicAlian/recommended/220780/","CosmicAlian","CosmicAlian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CosmicAlian/","224 products in account","The game is pretty and quite fun. But sometimes the controls might not respond (for me, thomas and other thin blocks felt like they had a delay from press to jump which made each obsticle more aggrevating).\n\nThe level design is really good for the most part. Each level had its own challange that you had to over come. But sometimes the levels would be intentionally made to make you rage. There were multiple times that the game would put the same jump three times in a row. this is no problem with playform jumps where you just jump forward but become long and tedious when you have to somehow get the small square block, chris, across by having him jump on thomas, then onto james then thomas jumps on james and then lastly chris on thomas again so he can make the jump. this would be fine to figure out once but this specific jump was done in multiple levels and multiple times per level, one after another. In later stages, not making the final jump caused you to have to repeat each and every previous jump from before. This quassi-difficulty increase makes the game stale and hard to binge on for a long time as you will fail and get punished often.\n\nThe controls are fiddly aswell. there are sometimes more than 5 characters to control and you can't navigate using number keys which makes the camera jump often which gets frustrating after a while. Speaking of the camera, the camera itself feels sluggish. It was programed to move smoothly and fluidly while tracking your character which is fine when you're walking in a line but becomes annoying when you jump and have to let the camera catch up.\n\nBut overall the game is great. I love the small maps with a few characters on them as it bypasses the flaws. I love the character diversity, they really thought of everything that could be done in a 2D space. The narrator is a fantastic idea although his speaches would often be at the worst times. Sometimes he spoke at the beginning which is fine, sometimes at a check point where if you died he would repeat himself which gets annoying to hear. And sometimes he would just say a paragraph right when you exit the level, and CAN'T redo the previous level without restarting the chapter, so you leave before he finishes.","July 12, 2015","true","5.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Add a personalizing, caring and fun narrative and you turn shapes into characters, and gameplay into a fun packed, occasionally tense story. Wrap it all in well designed levels and cover it in a great simple UI and you have everything a well designed game should be.\n\nHighlights\nThe fun, character and world building narrative is the main thing that brings this game to life, but it wouldn't be for naught if the gameplay wasn't also so polished and solid. Great game design exists in every facet of this game.\n\n* Great ambient music and sound artefacts that, when combined with other elements, create some genuinely tense moments\n* Fantastic simple UI and controls that always feel light and reactive\n* Light but intelligent humour\n\nMistakes\nNot a single one. Everything is well made and comes together to make a great, fun experience. Anything I could point out that isn't perfect about this game is simply nitpicking, but for the sake of completeness it's worth mentioning that some may find the game stale, repetitive or unchallenging at times if they don't like the narration and tone. It's also fairly short and despite some good accomplishment based achievements for completionists, it doesn't have a strong amount of re-playability.\n\nRecommendations\nThomas Was Alone is fairly short, and clocks in at about 4 hours of gameplay, but it's worth another play or two a few years down the line, and has some good achievements. It's priced at £5.99/7.99€/$9.99 which is fair for such a well put together product, but may feel overpriced for the game length. It regularly goes on sale for -75% and occasionally even less.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/220780","June 22, 2015","true","5.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The first is that I honestly feel like if someone is looking to buy this game, they should not know about these flaws.  As silly as it sounds, the flaws are not nearly as large as one must portray through text, and I feel like the flaws would stand out more and be more of an annoyance for someone that knew about them beforehand.

The story will move you and you will not regret the purchase.\n\nContinuation below:\n\nAlright, so as incredible as the game is, there were two flaws that slightly bother me looking back.  The first and largest complaint for me would be that there were simply too many main characters in the story.  Personally, I think that The Architects (Thomas, Chris, John, Claire, Laura, James, Sarah) should have been the only playable characters in the game.  The storyline simply became too complicated once The Second Generation AIs (Grey, Sam, Jo, Paul, Team Jump) entered the narrative.  Twelve main characters is a LOT, and it's simply too many for a rather short story like this one.  The Architects were all captivating characters with great personalities, and I think that if Mike Bithell decided to expand on those characters rather than introduce five brand new ones towards the end of the story, it would have been better.\n\nSecondly, I wish that as the game progressed, they decided to ramp up on the difficulty in terms of puzzles rather than in platforming.  That's hard to say considering the thousands of hours I've put into countless platformers, but I feel like there was more room for expansion in the puzzle aspect of the game than in the platforming aspect.  The skill in the late game was based off of your ability to micro-manage all of the characters, and if you screwed it up you would have to do a significant portion, or possibly all of it over again.  I guess your ability to micro-manage is puzzle based, but it's very linear.  There simply isn't much room for expansion in that skill set.  While Bithell did experiment in other puzzle aspects, the clear focus was the ability to micro-manage and I feel like that was not the best decision.\n\nHowever, these two issues barely dent this game's integrity and I would still absolutely recommend it to anyone and everyone.\n\nOverall, 9/10","April 15","true","5.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are dozens more to be played with.\n\nAll this in a platformer with solid level design, but not at quite the fluidity of Super Meat Boy. Whilst on your adventure through the eerie but relaxing world of Thomas Was Alone, you can also indulge in the very superb narration by Danny Wallace.\n\nAll of these factors make for a very enjoyable experience, and I heartily recommend Thomas Was Alone. If $10 is too much, do not worry as it frequently goes on sale and has been featured in a number of bundles thus far.\n\nOn the more technical side of things, I experienced no issues whatsoever, and you should have a consequently bug-free experience. There is unfortunately no Steam Cloud support, but the game isn't the longest and so this won't pose much of a problem for the travelling gamer.\n\nFor the achievement hunters, all 35 achievements within Thomas Was Alone are extremely easy to achieve, and should not take more than 200-250 minutes to complete.

There were few parts where I felt frustrated or stuck, and the difficulty scaling through the later levels feels balanced and fair. The level design is excellent, you never have to go back the way you came to get something, or do something over and over. It's always new stuff. The overlaying themes of the game are very unique and interesting. It touches on some things that will almost certainly become relevant to modern society over the next decade.\n\nOverall, a very fun game, with excellent characters, and a bittersweet story. 10/10.","January 3, 2014","true","8.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You play as the main character, Thomas, and his six companions as they run from the ominous pixel cloud, threatening to eat them. These quadrilaterals are failed prototypes of a company that designs AI, and the cloud is the company's creation to get rid of Thomas and his friends. This puzzle game includes very unique levels, many of which all of the characters must work together in order to get just one character through a tunnel. The special strengths that each character has are also very cool. One of the characters is affected by gravity upside down, so when the roof is lowered, he has to jump. Another character acts as a trampoline, letting other characters bounce to otherwise unreachable platforms. The storyline is incredible, and the narrator provides funny thoughts from the character's heads, which can sometimes be useful in figuring out how to solve the levels. Although it seems like just a game with some rectangles jumping around, the music (which is amazing by the way) and the art style make this a very emotional game. 10/10, the achievements are relatively easy to get and the game provides 4-5 hours of good puzzles and a great storyline.","December 8, 2013","true","4.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The music was very emotional, the graphics were great (not that the graphics are important in this game), and the variety of platforming and puzzle mechanics are very interesting.\n\nBut that's not why I love this game.\n\nThomas Was Alone is an amazing game because its story creates relatable, unique characters out of things that you would never normally find relatable.  The "characters" in this game are rectangles, of one size or another, and they each have different skills and personalities. The story focuses on the relationships that form between these characters.  I was surprised by the connection I felt to the characters, and the level of emotion I felt when specific events happen in the plot.  While some of the puzzles may get a bit repetative, that is a minor flaw when compared to the depth and skill of the narration.\n\nI would still suggest buying this game if you're looking for a puzzle game, even though I didn't love this game for its puzzles.

An incredibly charming game, with a well designed learning curve and puzzles that are challenging enough to be fun but not so hard they get in the way of the narrative.  A narrative about colored squares...colored squares with names and personlites that you will come to think of as familiar characters.\n\nI am very grateful to the friend who gifted me this quite enjoyable experience that I might otherwise have never tried.","August 22, 2013","true","3.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You begin a few tutorial type levels moving "Thomas" an orange rectangle AI character around a world.  Later you meet other AIs who are all voiced by narrator with an English accent.  Thomas ends up meeting such memorable characters as Chris, Claire, John and others.\n\nThese basic coloured rectangles all have different strengths and weaknesses and at times only one can move to a new part of the level.  You have to use them as a team to solve the puzzles and get them to their end points to move on.\n\nI found myself pushing on and on.  There were a few tricky puzzles, but never anything I needed to look up help with.  Sometimes it was just about placement or pushing the jump key at the right time.\n\nThis is a short game, but a fun one.  If you see it on sale, do yourself a favour and buy it.  Also fairly simple to get 100% achievements as you hunt the spinny squares!","December 31, 2013","true","4.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

He was born and raised in Quebec, where his experiences with Nintendo games in his youth would later influence his game design. He studied game design at the Montreal National Animation and Design Centre, and worked at Ubisoft and Artificial Mind and Movement before starting Polytron in 2008.\n\nFish was a founding member of Kokoromi, a collective that explores experimental gameplay ideas, and organized Montreal's annual GAMMA games events. While Fez was in development, Fish worked on other unreleased games at Polytron including Super Hypercube and Power Pill.\n\nFez was released in April 2012 to widespread acclaim after a protracted five-year development cycle. Its final phases of development were shown in the 2012 documentary Indie Game: The Movie, which brought Fish fame unusual for game developers. Following an online argument in July 2013, Fish publicly announced his exit from game development, citing long-term mistreatment by the industry.","October 16, 2015","true","3.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"
