Metal Marines was one of my favorite games back in the day. I would play it daily. I've still been playing it on emulators even to this day. It's nice to see this re made. I hope its just as good. expect to see me playing this quite often as soon as the single plaer mode is playable.","January 17, 2015","true","3.4"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

Build your base then destroy the enemy. Devs are doing their job with frequent updates so you can expect  that it gets even better.\nSince it is a Early Access game, there is not much people in lobby, so take the time to train solo and/or find people in the community for multiplayer.","April 4, 2015","true","2.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"
