This game is a mod of the original half-life that came out in 2000, however because of its thriving community and plethora of mods, its age has only really now begun to show. It places you in a future alternate universe where the entirety of existence depends on your ability to partake in the activity of “Duel to the Death Space Frisbee” or DDSF for short. Below I've made a table to outline all the various elements of the game with a rating at the end.\nConcept        Description        Rating out of 10                Story        The story of Ricochet is a deep and complex one. You are placed in a totally new world, where it only seems as if people are interested in this sport "Space Frisbee". You are never told anything about your character, except that they are a Space Frisbee player. That being said though, your character is made to be disposable, and when your character dies, it's over. You are placed in the shoes of a new person, who wears the same clothing as you, and sounds the same as you, and often shares the same fate as you. It's a highly critical commentary on today’s culture, where it seems as if people are losing their lives to something arbitrary, almost a sport, for no real distinguishable reason. It makes the player contemplate what they are doing with their lives, and whether it is meaningful or not. I won't spoil the rest of the story for you, but all I can say is that you should look forward to epic conspiracies, insane bosses, and one of the most exciting and fulfilling endings in all of video games.        10                Gameplay        Now, Ricochet is truly one of this games that you can describe as "easy to learn, difficult to master". Its gameplay seems simple at first, as it begins with "throw disc and hit object" but as you progress you find more ways to play the game using its initial mechanics. First you're introduced with obstacles that your discs bounce off of, allowing you to start having your discs ricochet. The obstacles then change in complexity and usefulness, as near the later parts of the game, you even start to avoid them as they can be very deadly. There are different power-ups for your discs that change the way you use them, which gives a greater feeling of accomplishment when you figure out how to use one of the power-ups to its fullest affect. Ricochet’s gameplay respects player intelligence by giving you many different ways to play. The depth of the mechanics have been compared to dwarf fortress, and although I wouldn't go that far I can certainly see players sinking thousands of hours into this game trying to really figure everything out for themselves.        10                Graphics        There isn't too much to say here. For a game that came out 14 (now nearly 15) years ago, it looks quite good. When in came out it was among the best looking games to date, and remained that way until about 2005. Despite looking a bit aged its color and stylistic focus make it easy and pleasant on the eyes, while still allowing for good atmosphere.        8                Multiplayer        I'll just start out by say the multiplayer is AMAZING. It captures the cinematic and atmospheric feel of the single player, while allowing player interaction in a diverse open world. You're allowed to find various "Arenas" in which you may do battle with your friends to see who's the best at DDSF. With a booming community, and an incredible amount of modded servers you can easily find yourself playing this multiplayer for hours on end. Even though it's been 14 years, because of its very in-depth gameplay and large community, the Ricochet multiplayer is still one of the best you can find on this platform.        10\nAll in all, I'd give this game a 10/10. Everything about it is amazing and enjoyable, from its single player, multi-player, stunning visuals, in-depth gameplay, and did I mention its kickin' soundtrack? Well it's amazing. Seriously, if you don't have this game, you need to fix that right now.\n\nTL;DR In my opinion one of the best games valve has ever made, I highly recommend this game.","December 26, 2014","true","7.3"," 65 of 69 people (94%) found this review helpful 56 people found this review funny","94","65","69","56","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ooiman/recommended/60/","Ooiman","Ooiman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ooiman/","332 products in account","Just like Team Fortress and Counter-Strike, this was once merely a Half-Life mod that Gabe Newell and his co-workers decided to put some extra effort into. It became a high-end standalone title, and brother, did they make a good job. Improved textures, mechanics and overall level design.\n\nThe game is pretty simple at its core; it's a elimination/free-for-all game where you have to use your surroundings, levels and weapon - the power disc - to claim yourself the big name of the game. Moving fast and swiftly between platforms in a blitz of your enemies is vital for succession in this game. It takes some time to learn, and even longer to master. But by studying your opponents, you'll pick up their tricks soon enough and give them a taste of their own medicine.\n\nOne thing that I love about this game is the amount of servers that are available, over a decade after the game's release. You'll never have to wait for a server without open slots, allowing you to easily invite your friends to play with you. Trust me, this game is much more fun with your friends. The more players who join, the better and more intense the game becomes.\n\nIn conclusion, I think this game is extremely underrated and truly deserves a sequel. Lots of Valve fans seem to have forgotten about this gem, and even Valve themselves don't feature it on their official website. But I'm living proof that this game is still taking breaths. Forgotten but not lost, this game deserves your love. It's a part of the CS1 Anthology and the Valve Complete Pack, so chances are that you already have this game and simply forgot that you have it. Otherwise, it's available for the low price of $4.99 here on Steam (50% off as I'm writing).\n\nAnd yes, the graphics might not live up to today's standards. But when games like Minecraft sells millions of copies, I don't see how graphics are an relevant issue.\n\nOh, a final tip to those who'll try this game out: don't fall.\n\n9/10 (Would buy this game for a friend.)","December 3, 2013","true","7.2"," 57 of 65 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","57","65","0","0"

The sun was shimmering on the chairs of our concerto stage when I, Sanjay, began to get aroused by our head advisor. Kathline. She was 5'2" and 220 pounds with a fantastic body for someone like me. This happened during the begining of my journey through puberty and I detected a sudden flow of blood to my pelvic region. To my surprise, my ♥♥♥♥♥ was erect. I had read that the only way to rid of the stiffness was to cleanse yourself of the white, creamy, fluid inside. I slowly slipped my weiner out of my pants and began to insert it into the opening of my saxophone. Realizing that my ♥♥♥♥♥ did not yet have the gurth to be pleased by the large opening at the end of a saxophone, I walked over to Johnathan and grabbed his oboe. The choir began to reprimand me and tried to take the oboe from me, but I didn't give up. I forcefully thrusted my ♥♥♥♥♥ into the butt of the instrument when, all of a sudden, a magical liquid spewed onto Kathline, my true love. They all laughed at me, yelling at me never to come back.\n\nI hoped the worst was over when school started in September but the stories of "Sanjay ♥♥♥♥♥ Squirter" reached my school in no time, and I was tormented endlessly. Day to day people would mock me and hold their instruments near their pelvis. Months later, the date November 1st, I was walking home from school when a car approached me with what looked to be a model of me on top. After playing a recording of what sounded like a prepubescent child having an ♥♥♥♥♥♥ my "model" squirted out some mayo all over the ground.\n\nI was done with my life, ready to give it all up, but then something glorious happened. I spotted a new entry onto the steam store with a game called "Ricochet". I decided to give this game a try before I cut my life short. But once I started this glorious creation I couldn't stop. It made me realize that no one could mock me enough to force me to miss out on the greatest game in history. The philosophical value behind this game is much greater than what the creators could have possible imagined.\n\nI thank you and hope for everyone to try this game.","March 14, 2015","true","191.5"," 64 of 80 people (80%) found this review helpful 87 people found this review funny","80","64","80","87","5"

Doesn't mean it's a bad game.\n\nRicochet's game mechanics revolves around simple movement. The player can move side to side, back and forth but can easily fall off the platform they are on. Players are meant to jump platform to platform, but are only able to by stepping on the arrows at the edge of the platform. The arrows then launch the player into the air and towards another platform. A player in the meantime, can jump at the same time you can and both of you can end up colliding, falling into an abyss of darkness.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Redember/recommended/60/","Redember","Brody","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Redember/","156 products in account","Ricochet, I wouldn’t really label it under being a hidden gem or obscure. I mean come on it’s made by Valve, anything by Valve is known to a certain degree. But it is definitely underrated, people always shut down this game because it looks weird and or that it feels empty.\n\nValve certainly doesn’t seem to like it, they pay no attention at all to it and made it worth extra less in the summer sale and didn’t even talk about it in their backlog of old games which has the description of “Eleven games that changed the world, and one that didn’t.”... It’s Valve’s first game that was aimed towards being competitive and also isn’t related to Half-Life.\n\nThe game’s art-style is obviously derived from Tron, and takes place in some futuristic space planet arena thing. Regardless it’s actually pretty cool. And all the sound effects are unique and satisfying, except I swear the sound when you freeze somebody with a freeze shot is the sound of two lightsabers hitting each other.\n\nThe game unfortunately has no music of any sorts, I joked about this in a video where it was titled the full soundtrack to Ricochet but it was just an hour of nothing. But this game really could have used some ambience or something.\n\nAnyway, the gameplay consists of switching through small floating platforms by launching yourself from a jump pad and throwing projectiles at other players and making them bounce off walls and such to either push them into the endless void below or to instantly kill them with a decapitation shot.\nYou can get powerups that power your discs such as rapid-fire, triple shots, power shots that decapitate, and freeze shots that can home in on other players. That last one may sound overpowered but it’s actually the worst.\n\nThe game has three maps as followed: Arena, deathmatch, and deathmatch 2. Arena is the more competitive 1v1 map while deathmatch and deathmatch 2 are more for, well, deathmatches with multiple players.\n\nAnd that’s about all the game has to offer in terms of content, but the game is actually pretty addicting and encourages competitive play and for you to pay extra attention to everything detail, especially when you start playing Arena.\n\nRicochet is very, very underrated and has a great and fun experience inside it especially with friends. It’s only $4.99 and is usually $0.99 during sales. I definitely recommend it if you’re looking for a really fun game to play with friends, or just want to experience a piece of Valve’s history.","September 24, 2015","true","30.9"," 37 of 45 people (82%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","82","37","45","9","3"

That they wished people didn't remember. I could see why; it was a really small, simple, low def game. in other words to some people, trash. I'm not really sure when I got ricochet, as it was probably included in a counter-strike pack of sorts. I recently held a LAN party with 2 of my friends and we didn't really have any multi-player games to play, so jokingly I said "Hey guys, let's play Ricochet!" As luck would have it, they had the game too, so we installed and played it. My first impression of this small, 3-map game was "This is gonna suck" but as time went on, we all had a blast laughing at the low-quality screams of falling into a huge pink spinning vortex after being hit in the face by a high-speed disk. If you choose to buy Ricochet, get it in a pack where it's just an included game and don't expect any online servers; rather, play with some good friends and I assure you you'll have a great time.","January 3, 2014","true","6.7"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","24","27","0","1"

Never before has such revolutionary gameplay been unleashed unto our hard drives with such elegance and class. The core mechanics of "dodge and then shoot your opponents" and a never before seen in-depth combo system (predating complex games like Batman: Arkham Asylum by years) completely smashed the conventions of the genre when it broke onto the scene in late 2000. The charts don't lie when they say Ricochet outsold ♥♥♥♥♥ whipped "shooter" games like Perfect Dark and Aliens Vs Predator at a 3:1 ratio, and for good reason! Who here could honestly forget such classic maps like "Deathmatch 2" and "Arena" compared to the same old lame ♥♥♥ De_dust2's and 2Fort's?\n\nSadly, a jewish plot has emerged from the murky depths of the darknet to tell us otherwise; but I am here to help you wade your way out of the Kool-Aid pool and into the ever beckoning rabbit hole of freedom. John Carmack is a well known member of the Rothchilds industrial complex and JIDF, which has allowed for a complete whitewash over the video games industry. He has slept with atleast five prominent figures in the business, three of which have been confirmed: Sergey Titov (of Big Rigs and The War Z acclaim), John Romero, and later Gabe Newell among others in exchange for the complete deletion and issue of Cease & Desist orders to anything and everything related to Ricochet. This paved the way for the great Video Games Crash and the subsequent release of "progressive" and "sensitive" games like Quake III: Arena, Unreal Tournament 2004, etc. etc. which have been sonicpowered MEGAPHONES for so-called "Social Justice Warriors" to co-opt the hobby and effectively kill Ricochet's community.\n\nI implore you to shell out the $4.99 USD for this magnificent pioneer of the FPS Dungeon Crawler genre and ignore ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t JIDF/SJW propaganda like Hatred or Postal 2 which have burrowed their fat, agenda-ridden abdomens into our rights as god fearing American citizens.\n\n#GamerGate #NotYourShield","October 18, 2014","true","1.5"," 54 of 84 people (64%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","64","54","84","15","0"

It does this not by throwing you into lengthy, drawn-out cinematics, but with control and movement unparalleled in any game to date, graphics unrivaled by even the largest of studios, and combat so immersive, so unmatched, that no other game can quite compare.

It's probably the one lightest game that valve has developed and it will be  downloaded and installed in less than 3 minutes.\nYou can grab it for 3.74$ or with a massive discount during sales, during sales it has been seen to go for 0.99$ or 0.74$, it's included in the counter strike anthology pack.\n\nI mean you can play this game on a toaster:\n\nOriginally posted by Valve, about system requirements:MINIMUM: 500 MHz processor, 96mb ram, 16mb video card, Windows XP, Mouse, Keyboard, Internet Connection\n\nRECOMMENDED: 800 MHz processor, 128mb ram, 32mb+ video card, Windows XP, Mouse, Keyboard, Internet Connection\nPros:\n\n• You can install it in a matter of seconds\n\n• Its easy to understand the gameplay\n\n• Gameplay is small but very entertaining\n\n• Very good to train accuaracy\n\n• Bouncing arround and shooting disks is very fun\n\n• You can decapitate your enemies or watche them fall to the void.\n\nCons:\n\n• Community is very small\n\n• Game has a lack of servers and players\n\n• There are only 6 maps wich most of them look the same but with different layouts\n\n• Most servers are laggy / abandoned\n\n• It's a very repetitive game.\n\nDont take me wrong, I might be going hard on a game that was made in 2000, but as a game reviewer I have to see both good and bad sides, this game isnt bad at all for me and i dont think any of those cons will affect your reactin to the game, its a good game just to grab and play.\n\nIt's the most entertaining game that you can grab and play 10 minutes every day or while you are bored.\n\nI give this game a big 8/10\n\nThis game is completely good, like I said before the gameplay is very entertaining and fun and the controls are very easy to get used to, of course, its still a game that has around 3-6 maps only, still, its a very fun game that you can grab during a sale and enjoy it a lot.\n\nThere are around 3 servers that have people, and that's just daily, you can still approach this game during a sale and play it, its fun and very addictive if you get good at it.","February 15","true","0.6"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","9","9","2","0"

This combines so many good elements of what Valve is capable of, you really don't need anymore games after this. This is seriously the only game on Steam you need. All those other games like, oh, what, Call of Duty: Toasts, Team Hatress 2, Half-Life 2. I mean, come on? Why would Valve make a game only half finished and call it just that? What, you didn't know? That's why it's called Half-Life. HALF-Life. HALF. As in, HALF finished. Read a book people. Going back to Ricochet. This game makes me feel good when I play it. I like to play this game with my friends, Tim and Bob, on the weekends. This game helps me relive all of my TRON: Legacy fantasies. Some say if you play on the right servers (which are rumored to be hidden and only accessable by inputing a hexadecimal IP into the console), you are able to play with Daft Punk themselves. But if you're super lucky. you'll be getting lucky because Pharrell Williams will also be joining you on the server. Talk about Get Lucky, right? Right? RIGHT?! You could imagine my excitment when I heard that Ricochet 2 is being developed and will be released by the end of 2014. I mean, the internet said it would be, and the internet has been proven to never be wrong. I know some people have said that it was fake, but they're just weak. I know I'll be laughing at them when i'll be reliving TRON: Legacy over and over and over again, and they'll be busy collecting virtual hats/bitcoins.","December 15, 2013","true","0.1"," 19 of 28 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","19","28","0","3"

You try to knock people off platforms to earn points. And that's about the whole game. It may be simple, but it's very addictive. It's sad how little people play this, the most I've ever seen was 7 people, and there's like 5 servers. There's 2 gamemodes, deathmatch and arena. Arena is a 1v1 to try and get the first to 3 points.

It was a free modification for Half-Life, coming along with one of the patches to the game, and from what I know, it was supposed to show new additions to the engine, as well as just being a bonus. Yet now it's being sold on Steam serapately. And in this case, it wasn't a good move.\n\nAnd well... Player base of this multiplayer game is dead. Completely. And is the main reason not to recommend this for purchase.\n\nOtherwise, the game is not horrible. It was good for what it was supposed to be - bonus mod. You jump between platforms using boosters and throw discs at opponents, either to push them off into void or to kill them. You regenerate discs ammo all time up to 3 of them. Pushing requires 1 discs, thus can be spammed. Decapating disc wastes all 3 "ammo". There is regular respawning power-up. And with usage of HL Engine advanced maneuvering (air strafing) you can try to outsmart enemies by landing on different platform than what is expected.\nAnd most often, you will fall into void due to your own clunkyness. Or bump into another player and fall down together.\nIt's just that it tried to push on art direction of "arcade/virtual" style too much, thus it lacks any casual fun of "shoot them the terrorists from awesome guns", nor does it has any pleasent art in levels themselves.\nOtherwise, nice bonus mod, for 2-4 players DMing.","August 14, 2014","false","2.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NoTimeForCaution/recommended/60/","NoTimeForCaution","Kawaii Putin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NoTimeForCaution/","46 products in account","Ricochet is a very pleasant surprise - it is one of the funnest games I have ever played. From reviews I would've thought it's just one of those "10 minutes at a time" and at first that was true. For the first match I played. However, very soon after that, my friends bought Ricochet as well after seeing me play so we got into a server with about 15 other people and had the fun of our lives. It is highly addictive as nicotine. The graphics are nicely done for the time and never once did I think the game is ugly. There isn't much variety in the gameplay, but it is fun and you will come back to it daily. Good thing is that if you have friends this game is an ABSOLUTE BLAST and you will love it for however long you play it. One time I played the game for 100 minutes straight, until I realised I was playing too much.\n\nGet this game... NOW!\nAnd the game isn't dead, as the people say. It has a great community with really funny people, and sometimes the servers can have more than 15 players, and that is ♥♥♥♥ing chaos when you don't even know what is happening, but usually there's about 10 people playing overall, so bring your friends over and have fun.","December 31, 2015","true","7.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

They've created an experience that breathes 50's period class and chews on its grit as well, but, more importantly, that offers players a wholly new and uniquely challenging set of intellectual obstacles to overcome; fantastic and immersive inspection and interrogation sequences, as well as a solid narrative, draw you in. Certainly not every facet of Ricochet fits perfectly with the whole or stands alone without a hitch, but for players who appreciate uniqueness and corporate risk in the modern gaming environment, it is an essential experience.\n","November 26, 2012","true","0.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

With the main menu, loading screens and the HUD, it's obvious that it is Valve once you launch it. I mean you can also see that it's Valve by scrolling down and looking at the developers and publishers (both Valve). This game is a fantastic concept. There are many servers, all with very few to no people playing. The gameplay mechanics are painful to learn and inact. It is definately NOT worth $4.99! For a game that was released in 2000, has many flaws, old graphics, and few people playing? I would definately not call it a rip off, but I would call it a failure. The game can be fun if you play it right, and to see a modernized version of this game would be great, but overall the game is not worth the price it's sold for, and the gameplay can get really repetative. The horrible sounds of your character falling into the void, over and over... Ugh... Anyway, if you DO want to get this game, you should get it in the Counter-Strike Anthology or Valve Complete Pack, or other packs, god knows what else they have... Don't get me wrong, this game is an amazing concept! If they would improve and make it worth our time, effort, and MONEY, it could be a great game. Overall, the game does not look completed, I could imagine so many features to this tron-styled game. I mean it's called 'Ricochet', and that's exactly what it is, glowing platforms in space, that you can jump off and ricochet onto others. Don't waste your time, unless you know exactly what you're getting.\n\nGame Cons:\n\nOld game\nBroken mechanics\nUnfineshed, and buggy\nTerrible, old HUD\nNo people playing\n\n\nGame Pros:\n\nFantastic Concept\nSometimes fun\nMultiplayer works great\nGoes by it's title","December 1, 2015","false","0.4"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","7","12","0","0"

The game has a few purposes to it: don't fall, don't get beheaded, and don't get hit.  There are two game modes (as far as I know): arena (one-on-one matches) and deathmatch.  This game was an idea in which one could make a popular game with a short budget and a simple set of rules.  It did successfully but with short lived fame.  It's fun to play with friends but keep in mind that friends is all you've got because the community is pretty lifeless with some bots.  If you want to play the game, be sure that you have friends who are willing to buy as well.  If you get bored, it's not a surprise even with old-community made content because the idea is still the same.","February 1, 2014","true","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Today the community of active players is small and there are not a lot of games to join (I just found a couple of servers with 2 people each). I got this game for free with Counter Strike 1.6 and decided to give it a go. It's a Tron type game with the matching visuals. The gameplay is about disk throwing and pushing your opponents off the platforms. Which is great but lack of people to actually play with pulls down the score a little bit. However even dueling one person is good fun so I recommend it.","December 6, 2014","true","0.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MAGNUSWAKER/recommended/60/","MAGNUSWAKER","mAGNUSwAKER","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MAGNUSWAKER/","231 products in account","Introduction\nVALVe's mostly unknown experiment with the GoldSrc engine. This platform-esque shooter was the source of VALVes most hated projects, lauding it's ridiculous concept and lack of support.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay is platform-based first person shooting as (and might I add eerily) same vain as Tron, the famous sci-fi film. You must knock each other or shoot discs at the head to score points for a kill or knock them off the platforms to also score a kill/frag.\n\nRecommendations\nHaving played through it, the charm and potential for a sequel is quite possible.\n\nCriticisms\nMajor\nOne map is literally all there is to this game, so variety becomes a serious issue for a paid game that is for £4.00. Due to it's lack of popularity, this game never developed very well nor did it evolve with modifications to it's Goldsrc counterpart, it is quintessentially a dead game, often used mockingly to name a certain "third project" VALVe is doing.\n\nThe game only has 1-5 players playing. Don't believe me? Go to the server browser.\n\nMinor\nLatency on some servers is extremely high, at about 100-200 mS ping. This arguably makes the game almost unplayable when network jitter occurs.\n\nUnpolished textures.\n\nMusic\nApart from a few screams and moans and the gun's sound effects sounding like something out of Tron. Extremely empty of anything else.\n\nGunplay\nAim and fire disc with the mouse or deflect them off bars to hit them off the platform to their barren, empty doomed lives! As it's name suggests, if you 'ricochet' the disc off the walls and hits an opponent, I believe more points are added.\n\nGraphics\nUtilizes GoldSrc's detailed MIPMAPPING, colourmaps, skeletal animation giving impressive animation (for the time). Atmospherically dark with a focus on contrasting magenta on black. Very tron-esque.\n\nMechanics\n\nJump from platform to platform, watching that you don't fall off or decelerate enough to fall into the abyssal plane! Shoot discs at other players. Some platforms may spawn or generate an ability to fire triple discs, to increase the likely hood of attacking and pushing several players off, a decapitation power up which deals out a one-hit kill disc that slices through your victims head and rapid fire disc power ups which spam out 3 in quick succession!\n\n\nStoryline\nIt's matter of you against everyone. Fight!\n\nEvaluation\nThe reason this game is not put on Not Recommended is due to the fact it was and maybe is possible for the game to be revitalized by fan/moderators efforts. The Source version of this using the Half Life 2 base is on Mod DB and improves on the formula whilst removing it's weaknesses.","February 16, 2014","true","0.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","5"

Sadly this game lacks a sequel but with the masterpeice it already is it doesn't need one.","December 23, 2013","true","0.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I guess it is made really good for the game, that they did not feel the need to make any more, but who are we to judge the developers, maybe they just got bored out of the project after they saw that it ain't really popular. The gameplay isn't ordinary at all, but that is actually good, because it just adds variance to the First-Person genre, regardless if it works. You can only shoot in a horizontal line, you have 3 disks that behave somewhat like boomerangs and get back at you. Instead of pressing a button to jump, you have special pads across the map, so you can't jump whenever you want and the goal is to hit your enemies so they fall below the map and die.\n\nI'd still recommend it, it has like 5 players at a time, but it's still a refreshing game.","June 24, 2015","true","0.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","3"

I just wish more people would appreciate this hard work and effort. I'd give it the GOTY award, if only it counted for games of old.\n\n10/10","December 22, 2015","true","0.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I guess it is made really good for the game, that they did not feel the need to make any more, but who are we to judge the developers, maybe they just got bored out of the project after they saw that it ain't really popular. The gameplay isn't ordinary at all, but that is actually good, because it just adds variance to the First-Person genre, regardless if it works. You can only shoot in a horizontal line, you have 3 disks that behave somewhat like boomerangs and get back at you. Instead of pressing a button to jump, you have special pads across the map, so you can't jump whenever you want and the goal is to hit your enemies so they fall below the map and die.\n\nI'd still recommend it, it has like 5 players at a time, but it's still a refreshing game.","June 24, 2015","true","0.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","3"

It centers around a misunderstood man, in a dead end job which requires him to throw discs at intergalactic mobsters that look just like him. It really has one of the most depressing stories that I have ever seen. The main focus of the game is to be as boring and sad as possible, it really shows a mirror to the working class society with how boring it is. Sometimes, I remember by youth and contemplate suicide because of this game, it really is THAT depressing. I'd recommend this game to you, if you like to be in a constant state of depression and boredom.\n\n\nAlso, there is one map and the discs are utterly useless.\n","December 24, 2010","true","0.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game feels like Tron. You know Tron? Where the people ride disks and throw motorcycles? Its just like that, just without motorcycles and any servers with more than 5 people on it because this game is @$$. You bounce around on these little neon platforms and shoot disks at people. Its bad. This game seems like it would call a flash game site its home, afterall the game only takes up 16mb of space on your computer. Whats really sad is that this game costs $5 on Steam. Luckily I got it in bundle. There are few servers running that actually have people playing. When you get onto one of those you relize that there are no dedicated servers for this game. Everyone on the server is running 100+ ping. Everyone is named Player for some reason and no one demonstrates any kind of skill in game. I ended up at the top of the leader boards within 2 minutes of joining a server, with 300 ping. Without anykind of tutorial or campaign your left to figure things out by yourself. I still don't understand what I'm doing but I guess I'm doing the right things because I'm destroying everyone on the server.\n\nWhen you get tired of playing laggy multiplayer, you want to play with some skilled bots.

Never before have I seen a game that has struck me this deep.\n\n10/10","December 13, 2014","true","0.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

You hop around on platforms in a futuristic setting and throw discs at other players, similar to Tron. This game is rather old, so the graphics aren't the greatest. The sound effects are lacking, and I don't recall any music. The biggest reason that I don't recommend this is because of the lack of servers. There were usually only 3-5 servers while I was playing, and most were empty or had a few bots. It would be nice if there was an offline mode with bots, but like many of the old goldsrc games, there is not. If you really want to try this out, you should definitely wait for a sale or get it in the Counter-Strike 1 Anthology.","November 26, 2013","false","2.6"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

ONLY 1 MAP!!! PERFECT!! It even has, according to Gabe Newell: "a giant story arch, a lot of twists and turns, and a very hard game to make!!! And if you liked this game, Gabe said that they are working on Ricochet 2!!! Great!!!~\n\nNot really, Ricochet is a new game, not a First Person Shooter... more like a First Person Jumper. I didn't like it. It's annoying. It gets me mad, even though i've only played it for 6 minutes. However, by seeing this game, you can tell that VALVe is great. Again. Why? Simple. Their minds are brilliant. Even though the game is bad and boring. Only VALVe (Gabe) could think in such a great game like Ricochet. Now please VALVe. Bring us Ricochet 2.\n\nI don't recommend it because i think it's not worth to buy it, only if you really want to support VALVe. I bought it with "Counter-Strike Anthology" thing. That's how i got it. But don't buy it, seriously.","December 22, 2013","false","0.2"," 4 of 15 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","4","15","0","0"

People don't really play this game anymore, unfortunately. And, unfortunately, a multiplayer game needs players for it to be fun. I'm a sucker for Tron-style things, but this game is, sadly, a desolate wasteland in its current state. I probably would have had a blast with this game when it first came out, but I guess I came in too late.\n\nMaybe this review can be considered a recommendation for others to play it, so I can have the actual opportunity to give this game the chance it deserves.\n\nI, personally, am game for a Ricochet 2.

It's fun to bounce off of... bouncy bits and throw disc... things against... bumper things to knock that one prick off the stage. I only have a few real gripes with this:\n\n-It can be difficult to find a server to play on\n-The aforementioned bouncy bits have varying degrees of bouncyness, without any indication of what that bouncyness is. This means that there will be times when you expect to fly way over yonder when you only go down a floor.\n-The additionally aforementioned disc things are effectively two dimensional, so you can't shoot at someone a floor above you, and vice versa. The bumper things are also very picky where you shoot them, so if you shoot your disc as soon as you go off the bumper, it's heading off to the vastness of space.\n\nI found the power-up system to be enjoyable, but confusing to new players. To save you the trouble of figuring it out, I've prepared a little guide.\n\nNote: You can have multiple power-ups and once.\n\n-Power: Red Thingy: Decapitates people when you shoot them\n-Fast Shot: Green Thingy: Lets you fire a flurry of discs at your opponent\n-Triple Shot: Purple Thingy: Let's you fire three shots at once in three different directions. Useful for ricochet kills.\n-Ice Shot: White Thingy: Turns victim into effective turtle on hit. Also seems to have slight homing properties from my experience.\n\n5/6 Would play regularly","December 31, 2014","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
