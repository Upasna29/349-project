(Definitely pick it up if you have kids that will play it!)","October 6, 2014","true","9.0"," 86 of 103 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","86","103","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/genkisan/recommended/316260/","genkisan","Genkisan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/genkisan/","5951 products in account","Ok, So I of all the new Disney games that were recently released on Steam, I have to say that Disney Universe and Epic Mickey 2 are my favorite so far with Disney Universe on top.\n\nYou start off picking from a very generous choice of costumes for your character, from Mickey Mouse,  Donald Duck, Tron, A Bug's Life, the Princess from Aladdin, Angelica from Pirates of the Caribbean and a bunch more. And you can find a ton more costumes throughout the game to add to your costume menu and use.\n\nThis game feels almost like your playing a LEGO video game but the amount of fun you will have here is intense.\nThe graphics detail is awesome and the sound fx and background music really gets you into the game. It's really good.\nThe cut scenes are really well done with a lot of humor and makes you look forward to seeing the next cut scene. Lot's of fun!\nThe gameplay is what definitely makes it for me. You run around beating up mischievous and evil little minions that are so bad they even do bad things to themselves. LOL. As you clobber them left and right, they drop mickey tokens that you will collect for unlocking the costumes you find throughout the game.\n\nThere are some moments that just cut right into the action when an arcade machine drops into the center offering you some kind of crazy challenge. Here is an example: I was fighting a bunch of minions with my sword having a hell of a time BAM BAM COMBO COMBO and all of a sudden an arcade machine drops from the air in front of me and I run up to it and activate it and it gives me a challenge to kill all the minions with a laser gun, arcade style. O.O\nOh hell Yeah! PEW PEW PEW. I was blasting them left and right! HAHAHA!!! xD\n\nOh and MOUNTS! Yes, you will find mounts everywhere from a cannon you can ride around and blast everything and ride animals like a sheep with a power slam or a pig with a toxic fart and a lot of other animals and things to mount and ride and find out what their skills are.\n\nPOWER-UPS! You will find power-ups all over. Some turning you into a tornado wiping everything out in your path or turning you into a jackhammer to drill into the floor and gather Mickey tokens or turning you into a snowman to zap and turn everyone into ice blocks. There are a lot of power-ups.\nAlso, you can level up your main weapon and every time you do it transforms into something else. I had a paintbrush and then it transformed into a magic wand and then a sword and when I got the Jack Sparrow costume, I soon after got a power-up that changed my sword into a parrot. LOL.\n\nThere are also a lot of other fun things you will find like throwable objects, bombs and water balloons and other fun stuff, and there are things that will turn you into a zombie. O.o\n\nI experienced all this within the first 30 minutes of gameplay and I am still finding more and more fun power-ups, challenges, secrets, mounts and costumes and who knows what else will come.\n\nThis game makes great use with the 360 controller as well as Keyboard and Mouse and is a lot more fun if you have a friend come over for local co-op. It would have been so much more fun if it had online play but with the amount of fun I have with Disney Universe, I can't complain. :D\n\nSo should you get this game? Heck yea! This game is a lot of fun! xD","October 11, 2014","true","31.0"," 49 of 52 people (94%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","94","49","52","5","2"

So far, I like the game, but the most problematic aspect is the lack of controls-modification. There seems to be no way to keybind anything if you are PC user, so it takes a bit of practice to get muscle memory in the use of the uncomfortable arrow keys  for movement.\n\nOther than the initial awkwardness, the game is cute and fun.  Game runs smoothly and is easy to pick up. Has a collectable aspect many people like me will like, where you can buy new maps, new costumes, etc.\n\n","December 31, 2015","true","0.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Necroscourge/recommended/316260/","Necroscourge","Necroscourge","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Necroscourge/","495 products in account","A strange arcade style puzzle brawler where you and three buddies cosplay as various disney and pizar characters from a handful of franchises. Sadly, "Universe" lacks many other franchises characters.\n\nEDIT: Stars guage power level, and they apperently persist and stay with ther costume. I consider that an honest mistake because it's certainly not explained.\n\nGameplay is a brain-numbing objective based brawler where you do what the game tells you and beat up anything that gets in your way. Enemies are actually fairly sophisticated. They infight, they build traps, they steal objective objects and run away with them; This makes having a lot of enemies on screen extremely entertaining rather than irritating like other titles. Even though you won't see them the first time, there are models for every type of unit for every theme. Playing with a lot of friends will thus probably bring out the hardest enemies in the highest quantity.\n\nEvery area is composed of three stages. The third has a boss. There are three areas to a theme. You unlock costumes by completing each area, with many costumes being unlocked by simply replaying levels.\n\nAfter awhile you start to get bored of the uniform design of the levels. While every level tries to introduce new mechanics some of them begin to get more intricate. I call it a puzzle brawler because that's what it is, you lack alot of mobility other such games have. There are jump puzzles, and they tend to be very irritating as some manuevers the game expects you to do often have a high chance of making you respawn. Even with a few deaths the game rarely gave me any better than bronze while solo.\n\nGet it cheap, especially if you have friends that enjoy drinking. Buy a few packs of beer and drink every time you respawn, that'll make the game far more entertaining. The lack of real story and limited selection of costumes can be a drag, and the gameplay tries to be inventive but the core player abilities are just dull.","December 7, 2014","true","5.0"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"
