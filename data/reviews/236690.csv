The thing I loved about Blood Bowl 1 was the single player options, from creating a custom league, to participating in a classic competition from Blood Bowl canon, and of course even playing a proper full career, clawing your way up the rankings over the years, up against all the famous classic teams of Blood Bowl lore, winning cups and trophies along the way until eventually, hopefully, winnng the Blood Bowl trophy itself.\n\nNow comes Blood Bowl 2; the graphics are prettier, but graphics aren't everything. The part that matters to me, the gameplay, the thing I loved in Blood Bowl 1 is... gone. The single player campaign is a shadow of what it was before. You can create a custom league, but there are no proper tournaments from Blood Bowl canon, and certainly no proper career. You play a few games in a single tournament, and then you are done. And the classic teams don't even appear in these leagues anymore. The whole thing is clearly obsessed with multiplayer, to the point that even in single player games the game still looks, feels and plays just like the multiplayer version, with randomised AI team creations clearly trying to pass themselves off as player teams. But it doesn't work. To take examples, the Broad Axes team might have the emblem of a Bugman's tankard, while Bugman's Faithful might have the emblem of an axe. Eh? It's randomisation gone mad. It makes no sense. And as I said,  there are no Reikland Reivers or Gouged Eye or Chaos All Stars. Unless you play the introductory "tutorial", or single one off matches without continuity, you will never see the classic teams of Blood Bowl lore at all. That's just not good enough. For me, without the ability to play a league or proper career with your own team against the classic sides of history, the appeal just isn't there.\n\nAnd there are other disappointments. You can't improve/modify a player's armour any more. Many of the other options of old just aren't available. The font is -  to my eyes - some horrible thin eyesore - and the UI just ugly, literally not pleasing on the eyes. Meanwhile the commentators Jim and Bob now insist on actually appearing, but just get in the way. In short, while this game might be a multiplayer's paradise, it doesn't work for me. Maybe Blood Bowl 1 spoiled me, but to my mind Blood Bowl 2 is several steps backwards.\n\nNow this might sound like I'm some kind of hater. But I am a fan of Blood Bowl and for the sake of the franchise I sincerely hope that people out there are enjoying this, and I wish the game very well. I do want this to succeed. But the single player aspect desperately needs work. The single player game is an opportunity to offer players content that multiplayer content cannot provide - such as a proper career.  But it simply doesn't. For me personally, Blood Bowl 2 is a big disappointment, and until the single player game is improved I will be sticking with Blood Bowl 1, because unfortunately, for solo play, Blood Bowl 1 remains far superior.","October 6, 2015","false","4.1"," 1,185 of 1,436 people (83%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","83","185","1","30","47"

The graphics are better, the UI is vastly superior, and it's far easier for newer players to pick up the game and learn. There was an issue with the end turn button being in an awful place, but that's been fixed.\n\nAll that said, there are a few downsides. I do wish the DLC had launched with the game, as it seemed to me they marketed it that way. I also wish the league settings and stat tracking were a bit more in depth, but that's something that could get patched in down the line.\n\nOverall though, the game is solid, and I've had a ton of fun playing it. Some might say it's not worth the price, but I've played this game far more than a lot of other games I payed the same, or more, for. If you love sports, turn-based strategy, and fantasy, you'll love Blood Bowl 2.","September 23, 2015","true","110.3"," 523 of 644 people (81%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","81","523","644","18","12"

It's sure prettier than Chaos Edition (Blood bowl 1, all add-ons), and the client seems more usable. But there is so much in it that just irks me. This product doesn't seem to deserve its price bracket:\n\n-Fewer teams, I know more are coming, but I also know they are going to be add on DLC at an as yet unknown price. At £35, thas a bitter pill to swallow. It also makes some teams indirectly weaker, with all but one of the current teams being relitively tough, or having easily available tough units, this makes a block/injury focused team less affective.\n\n-Lack of assets, there are only 2 spectator models, ork with drum and human in armour. Stadiums are all identicle until leveled up with small differences that have nothing to do with their starting theme. Players have only one model and sometimes an alterable face (per unit type obviously).\n\n-Poorly thought out UI. For the most part better than BB1 but with a host of new flaws that I'm hoping will be fixed dispite being identified early in testing and still being there now. For instance, team purchasing, in which you ask players to purchase units without allowing them to pick extras. This means that new players will end up spending all their ingame cash on units without getting vital re-rolls, because re-rolls are purchased later.\n\n-Poor single player experience. Yes it is a 2 player board game, but we were promised a decent single player experience. But the "Campaign" mode is a drawn out and frackly dull tutorial, while league mode doesn't even attempt to hide the fact that its just a bot game generated at your teams current point value. Combine this with a bafflingly inconsistant AI, and I can't see why I should play this over Chaos Edition right now.","September 22, 2015","false","4.5"," 333 of 465 people (72%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","72","333","465","9","1"

Well, let's get to it, then.\n\nStepping in the right direction:\n+ Better UI.\n+ New Race: Brettonians.\n+ Better Graphics.\n+ Easy to invite Steam friends to a friendly match of Blood Bowl.\n\nRetreading same old footsteps:\n= The announcers are back, and they are just as fun to listen to. This time they even come with subtitles that don't match half the time and can't be turned off.\n= Solo Old World League is a solid replacement for the original Campaign.\n= It's Blood Bowl.\n= Customization ups the ante with choosing uniform patterns instead of just a single colour, but scales it back again by letting you only change the players' heads.\n\nAnd, of cousre, the backsteps:\n- No mid-match "quit and save" option in single-player, except in the campaign. As clumsy as the old SaveBetweenHalves/Drives->AbandonMatch->QuitWithoutSaving routine was, there was, at least, a way.\n- The Campaign (Story Mode) is just an extended tutorial utilizing the Reikland Reavers (Human).\n- Blitz Mode is gone. No more custom gear for you.\n- Back to 8 teams? Are you joking? Chaos Edition had 23. 23!\n- No team-specific cheerleaders. Human cheerleaders for everyone!\n- Very limited graphical options (Resolution, Quality presets, Grass, Spectators).\n- No full screen option. What is this, 1995?\n\nSo, in the end, yes, I would recommend the game, but only if the following conditions are met:\n1. You don't own the Chaos Edition of the original Blood Bowl.\n2.

The list of disappointments is too long to go into, though amongst the worst offenders are the console-centric cut down options and UI, the AI that (despite devloper claims) is exactly as bad if not worse that in the original, the treacly performance on decent machines, the lack of visible levelling on players, lack of star players and the temerity to change the rules of an established and hugely playtested game.

Simply because in BB1 you could play the game with these toggles on, now they take up so much of the screen you can't see what's going on.\n\nOn the positive side they have got rid of the laboured walking the players used to do to their positions at set up. It was particularly painful watching the treeman walk to his allotted square. They now teleport.\n\nStatistics are finally available, although it would be nice to have this as a team overview, rather than having to click on each player to see their individual stats.\n\nAnd in an attempt to woo back their disenfranchised fan base, they have declared that the next four races will be free to existing holders of the game, which is fantastic news.\n\nHowever, until they return the rules to normal and make their new-fangled crap optional, I will not be changing this review to positive.\n\nAnd it would be polite of them to remove the lies they've written all over the BB website about the AI improvements, since they obviously have no intention of fixing that.**********\n\n\nFor all of you hanging out, waiting to see whether or not you should buy this game yet, here’s why you should keep waiting:\n\nBecause this got really long so here’s the summary:\n\nGood: Graphics\nBad: Everything else\nIf you want to buy a good game, buy Blood bowl: Chaos Edition. It is a supremely better game.\n\nNow the long version:\n\nNumber of Races – Let’s get this out of the way first. It wouldn’t bother me that only a fraction of the all the possible races are available, if Cyanide had provided me with a product that was an improvement over the original game, but they haven’t.\n\nBB2 is frankly no frills BB1.\n\nBlitz mode – Where’s it gone? Or perhaps I should say, only Blitz mode is available. Why can’t I turn off the OP stadium improvements? Now the death roller can stay on pitch for the entire game!!!!\n\nBalance fixing – Some bright spark has decided the GW’s rules need to be ‘fixed’. And again, this can’t be turned off. You now have to spend your gold because anything above 150k counts towards your TV. WTF? That means when my wood elf team gets decimated against the dwarf death roller, I can’t buy any replacement players.\n\nSkill icons – Perhaps these will take some getting used to, but they are too small to distinguish and aren’t obvious. It requires you to hover your mouse button above the icon. But to do this you have to click on the player first. So you have to stop what you’re doing, which takes time. So much time. Would it kill them to put the names next to the skills, like they did in the promotional vids?\n\nGrid – A lot of people have complained about this. I don’t think it’s so necessary with the new UI, but it would still be nice to have a toggle option.\n\nPosition labels – This is a big one. Not being able toggle names/positions/numbers makes identifying players, which look very similar, really hard. I have thrown blocks against chaos warriors thinking they were beastmen.\n\nStatistics – Another biggy. I don’t know who my top scorer is in any of my teams. I don’t know who’s suffered the most injuries. Why the hell not? This is part of the beauty of the game. This is what gives character to our players. More than fancy graphics.\n\nFancy Graphics – While we’re on the subject of graphics. I would like to point out that the only thing Cyanide have improved is the graphics. But who cares? In my opinion this is the last thing you fix. Until you have a playable game, who cares if it looks pretty.\n\nMore stats – You can’t examine the line-up of the opposing team in the inducement stage before the game starts. In BB1 you could click on the match record after the game and see the opposing coach’s stats (percentage of games won/lost etc.). You could examine his other teams. You can’t do that anymore. Why not?\n\nMatchmaking – Matchmaking is horrible. Teams with unbalanced TVs come up against one each other all the time.\n\nSlow set up – Every time you move your players before kick-off, they have to go through the action of actually running to where you told them to go, rather than simply appearing there. Great! It looks cool, like the action replays of my players hitting their opponents. But after the first game, I’d like to turn it off (as I assume most people did with the animations) because it simply wastes time.\n\nAI – Now I know not everyone cares about the AI. BB is a multiplayer game. But I don’t always have time for a two hour game that I can’t pause. And when I don’t, I would like to play against something challenging. To be honest the promise of improved AI was the reason I bought BB2 in the first place. Otherwise I could have carried on with Chaos Edition (which is a better game – not just a bit better, supremely better).\nDon’t get me wrong. The AI is different. It doesn’t do the same stupid s**t anymore. It just does different stupid s**t.\nIs it better?\nNo.\nOn my first kick-off I was delighted to see a team of orcs set up a cage. The second kick-off they received, they started setting up the same cage. Then, halfway through, they just gave up, leaving a whole flank wide open. To make matters worse they never, ever picked the ball up with their thrower. Not once. They always elected to collect it with a Blitzer. Those are examples from one game, but suffice to say I have not even come close to conceding a touchdown to the computer and always win by 5+.\nI don’t want to bore you with more examples. The short of it is that the AI is not an improvement on the old system. Given that Deep Blue could beat a chess master in 1997, is it really too much to ask for AI that plays BB in a way that doesn’t totally suck, in 2015?\n\nConclusion:\n\nGiven that there are so many features of BB1 that have gone, what really cool things have Cyanide added to make BB2 better? I hear you ask. The answer is nothing. Zip. Zero. Zilch. Not one single thing that isn’t cosmetic.\n\nIt’s like Cyanide had a meeting with a big piece of butcher’s paper, on which they wrote every aspect of BB1, and then systematically crossed each off. Concluding, perhaps, that no one used those options. The second piece of butcher’s paper, designated for BB2 ideas, they left blank. Then all but the graphics team took a two year holiday.\n\nSo there we have it. Hopefully I haven’t left anything out. I apologise for the length, but so many features are lacking they need to be pointed out. BB2 is no frills BB1. If you want a good game buy Chaos Edition. Don’t waste your money on this.","October 1, 2015","false","250.0"," 118 of 159 people (74%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","74","118","159","7","4"

I can't give it a positive review for now, even if I hope that if some issues are corrected and more content injected to the game, I will gladly change my review.\n\nThe Good:\n- Nice graphics\n- It's Blood Bowl... It's brutal, it's fun, it's challenging. But well, that's thx to the board game rules, the videogame adds little to that.\n- Cool multiplayer with permadeath: it adds a sense of danger everytime you play, it's fun.\n- Cleaner HUD. There has been a lot of complaints about the "player cards", but I find it not so annoying, it's rather clear and nice.\n\nThe Bad:\n- The campaign is crap: you only play 1 human team, with false rules. It's utterly boring, not worth your time if you already know BB1.\n- The solo content is mediocre: the solo leagues are just multiplayer leagues but with AI. It all feels too generic for me, games are chained without other things to do inbetween apart from the rare level up. It feels really empty.\n- No player stats: that's the major complain for me, what's the point of playing games after games when you have no player stats (how many TD, passing, blocking, etc...) and leaderboards between all teams?? That's the basic feature missing that is the cause that I don't want to play anymore: I just don't see the point.\n- No visual enhancemnent when players level up: it's not major, but the lack of all these little features makes that you don't care for your team players, because they stay the same even if they are über strong.\n- Games are veeeery long: solo or multi, one game lasts in average 1:30 hours... It's too long! For just one quick game, when you don't have that much time to play anymore, you know you must reserve 2h of your time to play just a little game...\n- In solo, you can't speed up turns like you could in BB1: it made the whole thing a lot less repetitive.\n- The commentaries from Jim & Bob become repetitive very quick.\n\nThe Good to Have:\n- It's not major, but watching the same hit animation over and over when you block someone become really dull after a while, considering that you block A LOT during a match. I would have launched this animation only on big hits like injuries.\n- Where are the women? There's only 1 female player type + the duplicates pom pom girls. A strong lack of variety here, it's not made to help making women play this kind of games...\n- Eye candy: different pom pom for each race, a real spectating crowd, etc... What I don't understand too, is why making a big solo campaign with a lot of animation and what not, but for kick-off events you just have one poor line of text where you could have cool animations? (like, spectators trampling players...)\n\nSO that's that, my major complaint is that in solo, the content is very thin and don't want to make you take care about your team and see it to the top, and in multiplayer it's good but the matches are very, very long so it's a strong barrier, for me at least.\n\nHope the game will be updated and devs will listen to the community! It can become very cool.","September 28, 2015","false","24.9"," 212 of 313 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","212","313","3","10"

Thats it.\n\nVolume is the same with 3 options on 3 fixed sliders: FX Music Comments all going from 0 - 10.\n\nThe Tutorial is once again sorely lacking for any new comers to the game with no showing of how the calculations are done.\n\nThe campaign mode is a huge step backwards from the original, i prefered where i could pick my own team and lead them through a campaign rather than a single story mode.","September 22, 2015","false","4.4"," 217 of 348 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","217","348","2","2"

I will try being objective.\n\nMost of the complains about BB2 came from players that were playing BB chaos edition.\nYou'll hear, that the game is not finished, not enough teams etc etc.\n\nWell, true there are only 10 teams released as for now. But they kind of forget that most bought 3 games and a few years to get to BBCE while the first BB was in fact realeased only with 10 races too. And no, you just cannot do a copy pasta from an old game to a new one with new engine and animations. So saying that all was already done for them is just nonsense.\n\nBB2 is a remake if you want call it. The graphics are very good, the color choice is well placed. When you look at it, you just wanna play.\nAnd you can play! Never had any crash of any sorts, updates, not that frequent, are fixing skills issues. Looks also like the devs are listening to community needs (just read next patch) but are the worst rubbish team at communicating.\n\nTrue there is a ingame real money market (actually you get free coins to spend on that market) but its only eye candy stuff like jerseys. "Apparently" they made a mistake by taking some "free" jerseys away from players to sell them, and we should get them back.\n\nDLC wise, you will need to buy with real money new teams. True, this could come up as a lot of cash if you want them all. One could argue that you only buy the ones you really need!\n\nSo do i recommend the game?\nOf course! The game is good and very playable! The game itself is a bloody good game!\nthere are still issues to be fixed true, but nothing gamebreaking.\nIf you really want all the teams just buy BBCE, but dont mind old horrid graphics, and in all fairness "not so better" interface.","December 12, 2015","true","273.8"," 77 of 114 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","77","114","0","0"

( cKnoor has a good tutorial on how to build Brettonians and has footage of him playing them i suggest you check him out! )\n3 - The graphics here are amazing its superbly executed and it makes the gameplay a tad bit immersive for me personaly\n4 - Inviting your friends for a fun game of blood bowl is now a thing you can do, this is huge for a game like this!\n5 - The Announcers are back with more witty banter! I love Jim & Bob so so much <3\n6 -  AI is alot smarter than BB1 but still make silly mistakes like ridiculous re-rolls\n7 - The Armour Customization Patterns are pretty nifty i like them alot i just wish you could have the option to create your own uniforms in a creator and choose from the multiple patterns , colors etc, But as it is im happy with it!\n8-  It's Bloody Bloodbowl!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nThe Bad\n\n1- The Campaign acts like a tutorial but that shoudlnt be the case, its a bit of a slap in the face to those who are wanting to play offline campaign which was actually very enjoyable for me in BB1 but it is possible to make a solo league online.\n2 - The Graphical options are not acceptable to be frank , its lacking in many customization.\n3 - There are a ton of races missing so there is not alot of variety to pick from and to much about with, this is probably going to be dlc im just hoping we dont get screwed with dlc teams for like 5$ a pop\n4 - When Customizing your Characters you have a minimal amount of faces to choose from so your team just ends up looking like an army of clones.\n\nThese are my points feel free to share your opinions\nAs of now i rate Blood Bowl II at a 7.5/10 Its a SUPER Fun game but with the minimal races i cannot rate it over 8, if there were more races this game would easily be a 8/10 but theres still things need fixing!\nThanks for reading babes","September 24, 2015","true","147.6"," 86 of 139 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","86","139","0","0"

It's something you have to try to see if you like it, but ask yourself these three questions first\n\nDo you like strategy games? If no, don't get this, this is more strategy than sport.\nAre you not okay with permadeath, Don't get it, your players who are amazing will eventually die. (X-com level of trauma).\nAre you not okay with losing due to bad luck? Don't get it, because chance will screw you.\n\nThis leaves the question, should you get Bloodbowl 1 or Bloodbowl 2\n\nBloodbowl 2 is like two steps forward and one step backwards.\n\nGraphics are obviously better than the first one.\nThe UI has improved in some aspects, percentages are shown instead of forcing the player to know the rules. However grids on the field are missing, as well as the quick overview of the roles of the players. This is quite annoying since some different players can look the same.\nTutorial is also way better than BB1, it's slow but it explains the game fairly well.\nThe other single player content is lacking though, so you will mainly be playing this multiplayer. I recommend joining a private league though, as the normal matchmaking is flawed, due to some teams being clearly better in that format. These are easy to find in the steam forums. The community is way bigger, so you will find matches much faster, about 30 seconds, instead of the 15 minutes in BB1.\nDifference in the amount of teams is quite big though. 10 in BB2 while there are 24 in BB1.\nThat said the ten teams in BB2 are all of relatively equal strength, with one maybe being weaker than the rest. Whereas at least 6 six teams in BB1 are deliberately weaker. The advantage of ten players however is that it is easier for new players to learn strategies against the different teams.\n\nSo, I would say that for a new player bloodbowl 2 is better, but I would still wait for a sale.","November 3, 2015","true","152.6"," 97 of 160 people (61%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","61","97","160","4","0"

Incredibly deep gameplay/strategy, after 600 hours I still feel like a noob, every team can be developed differently according to how you like to play, and more than half the teams haven't been released yet so still plenty of variety to come.\n\n2. The game looks great and the UI is mostly excellent with some occasionally annoying exceptions which the developer has been regularly but slowly fixing.\n\n3. The community. This is the best thing by far, Bloodbowl isn't a game with a huge player base but it seems like once you start playing you don't stop, a huge amount of strategy guides available, all the streams I've seen have a very welcoming chat and once you feel like you've got a grasp of the basics there are a lot of private leagues with some really good and friendly players.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Steep learning curve with a not great match making system can lead to some impossible games when you're just starting out, the tutorial will teach you the basics, but very slowly, I'd recommend watching some streamers and asking questions in chat over playing the tutorial, and when you search for a game stopping and starting the search every ten seconds or so will help to avoid the more ridiculously impossible match ups.\n\n2. Time. Games can take over an hour to play, there's no speed mode so if you don't have that kind of time then this isn't the game for you.\n\n3. Salt. Everything in this game is decided on the roll of a dice, there will absolutely be times when you know you're playing someone who isn't close to being as good as you but he'll wreck you because he'll get every dice roll his way. The better you are the better you will be able to allow for the variance but sometimes you're going to be left disgusted.\n\n4. No competitive rankings. There's nothing currently like the ladder in hearthstone to judge yourself by, the main match making league is perpetual so really you have to join private leagues to find proper competition. Cyanide have put up prizes for a world cup competition but reallistaically only the very best players have a chance of qualifying for that, definitely my biggest problem with the game currently.","March 11","true","790.6"," 20 of 28 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","20","28","0","0"

Awesome, brutal animations, relatively beautiful graphics and easy, simplistic controls. Blood Bowl is essentially American Football mixed with the Warhammer Fantasy Battle universe where Orkz pummel Humans into the turf with wild abandon. Ever wanted to kill your opponent's entire team rather than score touchdowns? Well, Blood Bowl is your game. And as far as competitive Blood Bowl Multiplayer goes, this is the best Blood Bowl to date. Full on team customization from colors to races, mixed with Cabal TV (allows you to watch community replays and live matches between players) and a fully fleshed out League mode means having a persistent team  that competes against other players is definitely the way to play. You also get quite a few races to choose from, Humans, Bretonnians, Dark Elves, High Elves, Dwarfs, Chaos, Orkz, Skaven and even Lizardmen (or Wood Elves). Still, I'd like to see the other races in the game as well, especially the Undead, Vampire Counts and Tomb Kings.\n\nMy biggest complaints with the game are in the features the game is missing as opposed to Chaos Edition. For example, there is no real-time mode, there is no World Cup mode or tournament mode. It really focuses on the League mode between players. Essentially, if you have no friends or don't like playing competitively, there isn't much for you to do.

The game is a very unforgiving and clever turn-based strategy game set in an alternate version of the Warhammer Fantasy setting. It parodies american football and follows a similar set of rules but is (arguably, hah) more violent.\n\nMost negative reviews made by the self-appointed veterans of the series have rated the game poorly mainly for the reason that it has fewer races than the original Blood Bowl did. They write this however not mentioning that the previous iteration had in fact FEWER races on it's release. Sure, Blood Bowl: Chaos Edition has a noticably larger collection of them now but this was the game in it's final form. It was released THREE YEARS after the regular Blood Bowl had come out and was dubiously priced at the time.\n\nThese reviewers in their frustration add that the only way that the game improves on it's predecessor is in the graphics department which is in fact not true in any way whatsoever. A common complaint is that the new campaign is worse I but in all honesty the original one wasn't good either. The game was always best when playing against other people and Blood Bowl 2 features a significantly better matchmaking system in it's multiplayer. The game's UI and controls are not nearly as clunky and unfriendly to new players (or all players for that matter) as the original was yet at the same time it does not feel dumbed down making the game much less frustrating than the first part.\n\nFinally I'd like to add that the costs involved in making a single race (it's animations, models etc.) are astronomical and it should not come as a surprise to anyone that the game has "only" ten races so far. I strongly recommend that if you are even slightly interested in the game you should buy it now, not wait "for more to come". The game is a blast as is, is regularly being updated and the developers do really need any money they could get in order to ensure more content in the future.","December 29, 2015","true","96.1"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","17","24","0","0"

I know... shame on me!) and I’m also pretty confident that whilst a “Blood Bowl” sounds like an implement you might find in a hospital it is in fact a game set in the Warhammer Universe.\n\nBeyond that I’m as ignorant to the intricacies of Warhammer as I am to those of American Football\n\n\nUniquely Qualified\n\nArmed with this devastating lack of knowledge I have recently dived head first into the football/Warhammer mash-up that is Blood Bowl 2, sequel to the 2009 title Blood Bowl which you won’t be surprised to learn passed me by completely.\n\n\nEducational Beating\n\nHaving watched the funny and brutal intro scenes I found myself managing (and controlling) a down on its luck human (mostly) football team called the Reavers.\nLooking after this team serves as both a  tutorial and an introductory campaign to get you up to speed and ready to take your “Blood Bowling” prowess online.\n\nThe tutorial campaign does a really good job of showing you the ropes, starting off with a simplified version of the rules and building up the complexity with each progressive match until you actually know what you’re doing.\nThis subtle, layered approach is a perfect introduction for a blood bowl beginner like myself, I never felt overwhelmed by rules and each new concept was introduced in a way which made sense.\n\nThe campaign also has a light but fairly interesting story to keep you engaged between matches and ties everything together nicely.\n\n\nPad Away\n\nWhilst Blood Bowl is a fantasy sports title don’t go into this game expecting a FIFA or PES like experience or you’ll be disappointed, this is a turn based tactical affair, think XCOM with a football and you’ll be pretty damn close to the play style on offer here.\n\n\nDicey Decisions\n\nThe game take place across various stadia where you'll issue commands to each of your players individually and cross your fingers that everything goes to plan.\n\nThere are several actions available depending on the player type, from moving to a new position on the field, passing the ball or nobbling an inconveniently placed opponent to take them out of the action.\nThe success of these actions will depend on your player stats (as you would expect) and the randomness of a dice roll.\n\nThis randomness can be hugely irritating at times, if lady luck isn't smiling then even the best thought out move with most appropriately skilled player is going to fail, stats be damned, the dice of fate always have the final say... (how I've come to hate those dice).\n\nHaving said that, I can understand the need for this dice based uncertainty, even the best players fall flat on their face sometimes, it's still annoying though and maybe a little too random for my tastes.\n\n\nGOAL!\n\nThe aim of all this games-workshopy, dice-rolly action is to get one of your little guys  to stay upright long enough with the ball (which isn't round) to run clutching it between their hands  <cough> not football  <cough> and score something called a "touchdown".  (which apparently isn't anything to do with planes and runways).\n\n\nCompulsory Frustration\n\nAfter you've struggled your way through the tutorial campaign you'll know enough to be able to create your own team, and take your overconfident self online for a lesson in humility.\nBut before I get into the humbling experience of on-line play, let me explain why I both love and hate that introductory campaign.\n\nAs I mentioned a few paragraphs back, the tutorial does an excellent job of introducing the game rules and mechanics at a steady pace, unfortunately, what it doesn't do so well is let you progress through it by winning matches, that alone is not enough!\nIt also insists that you complete some very challenging objectives along the way such as "Score a touchdown with player type X" or "foul player X a certain number of times"\n\nThe campaigns insistence on completion of these "bonus" objectives can result in you having to replay a match several times before you're allowed to move forward.\nI can't overstate how annoying this is, but you could just skip the campaign and dive straight into team creation and online play if you know what you're doing.\n\n(which unfortunately I didn't).\n\n\nCreative Chaos\n\nYou create and manage your own Blood Bowl team from a selection of different races, from squishy humans through to squat dwarves.\n\nThe eight disparate races on offer with the base game come with their own strengths and weaknesses , an Orc isn't likely to have the agility required to pull off a graceful run around the opposing teams defence just as a slender Elf is less likely to muscle its way to the end zone by flattening a wall of defending  Orcs.\n\nThe different play styles required by differing races go a long way to keeping the game play fresh, although many might be by disappointed that only 8 playable races are included with the base game, but hey, that's what DLC is for, right?\n\nDepending on which race you've selected you'll have several different player types available to choose from ranging from throwers and catchers (bet you can guess what they specialise in) to blitzers (for blitzing...) and linesmen (for... err... making up the numbers).\n\nAnyway, after you've agonized about putting together a well balanced squad and more importantly given them all amusing names, it's time to actually put your team to the test.\n\n\nPlay Ball!\n\nThere are several ways to do this, you can play a friendly match, join a league or even create your own.  You're not forced to go online until you're ready either, the AI will happily try to pummel you into the ground as readily as any online player would.\n\nAs I said earlier, the matches themselves play out in a very turn based, action-pointy kind of way, but there's more going on here than just the matches, there's a football management side to Blood Bowl too.\n\nYou'll be buying and selling players, doing up your stadium, investing in bonuses (some of which can make a huge difference to the outcome of a match, re-roll is especially useful as it gives your dice a second chance to win lady lucks favour.)\nThere's plenty going on here  and you'll find yourself becoming attached to certain players as you progress through several matches with them, don't get too attached though.\n\n\nThey Killed Kenny!\n\nLike X-com, you're going to end up with "favourites" on your squad, there'll inevitably be a thrower that always seems to hit his mark, or a catcher with safe hands that always comes through for you, but be warned, your players are not invincible.\n\nThey can get knocked down, knocked out, maimed and even killed during the course of a match.\n\nLosing a star player can...

And I imagine in a year or two it will be solid. But much like BB1 was at launch Bloodbowl 2 is far from a complete game. Putting aside the fact that they don't have goblins or halflings (which is sort of a dealbreaker for me right off the bat) the lack of fullscreen (You can play borderless window at full resolution, but that overtaxes some hardware) makes it almost unplayable and little things like no armor upgrades and lack of a true solo campaign (you can play in a solo league but it is noteably less awesome than the solo campaign in 1 where there was a map and more of a sense of a world and story) make the game just lacking in gameplay compared to Chaos Edition.\n\nSo here's what it comes down to. If you're a hardcare blood bowl player and you want to support the studio so they can continue to imrpove this game and utlimately have 2 as full featured (or hopefully more) as one, then buy it. It definitely has promise and my family bought 3 copies for this reason.\n\nIf you don't already have Chaos Edition it really comes down to what's most important to you. If it's graphics then by all means, get II!\n\nIf it's gameplay... well I honestly can't bring myself to recommend II over Chaos Edition... yet. Chaos has had years to polish things and has 23 races compared to 8 here.  Which is really frustrating for me because I have friends I'd like to get into BloodBowl. But since I myself will be sticking with Chaos Edition until they've added some key things like fullscreen, more races, and a better single player experience, it's pretty hard for me to recommend this over Chaos, particularly given that Chaos is cheaper.","September 22, 2015","false","24.3"," 102 of 184 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","102","184","0","10"

Some pros, some cons in comparison with BB1.  The most noticable differences:\n1. Much better online than BB1 in public leagues. Private leagues will need some time to evolve to the level of BB1, but I believe it will happen soon enough.\n2. Interface is different and will require some time to adopt, but is of about the same level.\n3. Less number of teams, others will probably be in DLCs.\n4. AI is betterm but still good only for newcomers, it'll not hold vs experienced coaches.\n5. Some optional and obligatory homerules and some rules are bugged, but nothing gamebreaking if you can live with some changes from the rules.\n6. Better graphics.\n\nPart 2: REVIEW FOR NEW PLAYERS\n\nThere are several BB clients on the market: Fumbbl (the worst GUI and graphics, the best content), BloodBowl2 (the best GUI and graphics, most differences from original board game rules), BB1 is somewhere in between. There is no point in buying BB1 now as the number of players in online is bad. If you are not a diehard board gamem fan, the differences with the rules should not matter much for you, so get BB2.\n\nMost negative reviews are coming from experienced coaches who are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off with some differences with the board game rules and low number of teams. In fact it doesn't affect the core of the gameplay and present teams are enough to represent most aspects of BB and are balanced well. Teams that can come as DLC later are not going to be much better, the balance is quite good here, so if you are not going to try them all you'll not have to spend money on them. So do not be afraid of poor ratings or ranting in the forums. Haters gonna hate, but it doesn't really make the game worser for new players.\n\nI would recommend this game to you if you like turn-based risk-managment games or warhammer universe.","September 23, 2015","true","113.6"," 34 of 58 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","34","58","0","0"

( slow mo death time is awesome :D)\n\nBlood Bowl 2 is the mutant ofspring of american football and the fantassy warhammer world. The game is sertannly a great laugh but also is serious enough to justify long term dedicated game time.\n\nThis game inspires me to rage and ROFL in equal mesures depending on who nuffle ( blood bowl's god) shines on that day.\n\nThe game is ALOT more new user freindly than BB1 with a user freindly interface and you can even get an assistant coach (AI) to build your team for you till you start to understand how things work.\n\nBob and Jim our beloved ogre and vampire commentators never fail to make me laugh, a great example here ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhBgJZJYS00 )\n\nThe gameplay has 2 layers.\n\n1.The first of witch is where you design and change your team to fit you need as you manage things like your teams money and how many chearleaders you want to have.\n\n2. The second layer is the actual pitch where the game takes a TBS role where you posistion your players and fight all over the ball with the ultamate aim of scoreing more touchdowns than your rival.\n\n\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nHas been outstanding for me to say the least next to no loading time and good frame rates throughout. (and i have been recoding gameplay on top so performance is awesome for me to say the least.\n\n\nFOR PEOPLE NEW TO BLOOD BOWL ( Starting guide )\n\nOrks and humans are the 2 teams id recomend starting with there good allrounders.\norks if you want to be more blocky (fighting / killing) and humans if you want better controll of the ball.\n\nAfter you have a few games under our belt you may want to try a more specilised team with a playstyle you seem to lean towards and or like.\nFor example you try the Humans out but notice you like to bash in your rivals head ... well then try moveing on the the dwarfs or the orks if you dont want to give up the ball game alltogether :P\n\n\nAt first it may seem like you have nothing but bad luck with turnover after turnover and the game is treating you badly for some reason but a large part of the game is risk managment to reduce those turnover and a good coach knows how to manage those risks.\n\na few good tips for this are\n\n1. Allways stand up your fallen players asap\n\n2. Prioritse low risk and high reward actions before the vice versa\n\n\nFOR BLOOD BOWL VETRANS / CHANGES FROM BB1\n\nIts the old game you loved with a few ballance changes such as the ork blitzer has increased in price. ( I would go into more detail but as its the beta i expect they will either revert back or change more after the release / in updates to come)\n\nThe animations are really nice and far better than BB1 as well as the graphics.\n\nThe variations and differnt "jerrsy" / armour types are nice comapred too BB1\n\nThe lack of teams compared too BB1 can hurt but its not as though be seen alot of those teams played often. All the bases are coverd basic playstyle wise though with it only despratly needing a goblin team for the pure ROFL epic failness that they create and the shockingly epic 1 in 200 play where it all goes right :P\n\nYou now get your own teams stadium to change and personelise to fit your team.\n\nCheerleaders are allways the basic humans and i am hopeing and praying that is just for the beta but if its not i am going to be one sad bunny as i loved the differnt chearleaders from BB1\n\nAI\n\nThe AI is a big step up from BB1 with teams acting acordinly with there playstyle but any seasond players will probally still find it underwellming and need to look to PVP for there thrills.\n\nI expect there will be 5-10 DLC teams comeing either as single teams or as larger expanions pack style DLC.\n\n\n\nHope This helps you decide if you want to take the plunge and try this game out.\nGood luck and se you on the pitch :D\n\nwant to see gameplay please hop over to my channel :)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEWi55_w4pBFCy06QGTdOBw","September 22, 2015","true","38.5"," 60 of 107 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","60","107","2","10"

(They gain skills, injuries, death.) It's a gorgeous, rules-perfect (nit-picks aside) adaptation of the 30-year-old board game.  It is goofy and stupid and fun while also providing quite a bit of strategic depth, if you have the stomach for dice-rolling (and don't get too attached to your players).

That comes with the caveat that it's not going to be for everyone and it feels like it requires some reasonable commitment from the players.\n\nI have been a blood bowl fan, but hadn't played for many years, and had only played the tabletop versions before this; never any of the computer variants. For me, Blood Bowl 2 gives a reasonable way to play the game online, while not really providing much else.\n\nThere are two real modes of the game; playing vs the AI or multiplayer games.\n\nPlaying vs the AI is a fine way to play the game, and get a bit of practice in, but is not ultimately very challenging. If you are new to the game, I think the AI would be great, and a good way to learn the game, but there is a point where you will win every game, and there's not a lot more to learn from it. There is no difficulty setting, and the AI lacks a lot of basic strategy.\n\nGames vs other players becomes the game once you're half way decent, and is good if you're happy to schedule games and play regularly and be organised. Blood Bowl as a whole has a vibrant and friendly community, and joining their organised leagues is relatively easy. Organising private leagues with friends is better.\n\nIf you want to pick up an odd game to play now and again though, you're left with the Cyanide Open League, which is... well it's a way to play a game but not much else. There's not enough players, which can sometimes lead to long waits if it's the wrong time of day, or mismatches where someone with a very high team value is matched against a new team. Inducements are not good enough to balance the issue. There's also no goal or point to the open league, it just runs as a way you can play your team. For me, it feels like a practice room, somewhere to take a team for a spin to find out how they play but ultimately not really somewhere you are competing.\n\nThe open leagues feel like they need something more, like extra play modes, different competitions to enter and goals to strive for. Even something like a cosmetic rewards for winning a given number of games with a team - maybe win a new jersey, or get a trophy in a trophy cabinet. Extra play modes and different competitions is difficult though, because the player base isn't big enough - and without them I am not sure I can recommend the game to someone wanting to play on the open leagues. Something of a catch 22.\n\nThere are things missing from the game; sponsorship doing something, teams are missing, the marketplace has basically no utility etc.Those aren't big factors to me but it feels like the game is incompete, and the developers are active if somewhat uncommunicative.\n\nFor me, the game gets a thumbs up on balance, on the basis that you're happy organising games and playing the private leagues, with friends or online communities. It just feels like a bit of a missed opportunity. I like the game, I just can't love it.","April 5","true","321.2"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

It is often on sale at that price.  Game looks great and feels like an improvement in every way.  I haven't played very long so I will update my review if I encounter any issues.  Only thing i've seen so far is the subtitles of the announcers are off pretty often when they speak but its not a big deal.\n\nI debated buying this for a few days because of the lousy option to buy extra teams for 6 plus usd.  That is a crazy price in my opinion.  I'm not opposed to what they are doing as the orginal took 2 expansions before you had all the teams but additional teams would be much more appealing at the price of 2 bucks.  So I will just wait til they go on sale.\n\nIf you buy the game now before the release of the next 4 races you get them for free.  I think that is a decent price....about 20 dollars  (at 50% off) and you are getting half of the total teams most likely...then just wait for a sale on the rest of the teams.\n\nI think the game is worth it when it is on sale for 50% or more.","March 5","true","46.1"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","11","16","0","0"

But not the version in which you pick your dream team out of the best players of today, but instead a league made up of the various races from the Warhammer universe. Originally a miniatures board game, Blood Bowl had a few digital iterations and today we have before us the latest one with a ‘2’ added to it’s title. At it’s core, this is a faithful adaptation of the board game. Two teams numbering 11 players fight over ball possession during 16 rounds (8 in each half-time) in an attempt to score by crossing the opponent’s touchdown line with the ball. Unlike the real sport that inspired the game, this nets your team only one point and there are no kicks afterwards. And probably the most important difference – fights are not only allowed, but are encouraged.\n\nWhile the six-sided dice and random elements might be integral to the game, you’ll still have plenty of ways to skew the odds in your favor and avoid turnovers that force you give up your turn (by dropping the ball or having your player tackled). The basic systems might seem complicated at the start and the game’s manual can only be read on the website. So, to get you started, there’s a campaign in which you lead a human team, Reikland Reavers, through a hilarious story of trials and tribulations of this once-great team and through which you’ll get to learn how the game works. Each match introduces one new mechanic, from basic passing to stadium upgrades. While the campaign is great, it’s tutorial part crawls fairly slowly because in Blood Bowl 2 the matches can sometimes take 20-30 minutes.\n\nCompared to the previous game, Blood Bowl not only looks fantastic, but there are no obvious problems or bugs. The atmosphere during the matches is ecstatic, partly due to the kooky commentating duo of Bob and Jim (an ogre and a vampire) who comment for CabalVision in a typical TV style, but mostly for the excellent art style and high detail of models on the field. It’s absolutely tremendous when your successful moves get replayed in slow motion close-up, while the audience’s cheers drown out the commentators. Blood Bowl 2 is a game that is hard not to recommend, especially if the idea of rugby… erm – American football featuring orcs, dwarves, elves and other Warhammer races sounds like a great pass-time to you, and you don’t mind getting used to a somewhat complex tactical system.\n\nFull review here: http://play-zine.com/2015/10/review-blood-bowl-2/","March 1","true","7.4"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

I really enjoyed the board game and later the first Cyanide release of the PC game.\n\nUnfortunatley they somehow managed to epically F@#k up BB2.\n\nThe good things I will say is that they made the graphics better and more polished, and thats pretty much the end of the 'Pro's'\n\nThere are too many cons to list so I'll just name my main ones.\n\n1.

Those who play BB will understand how lazy and lame this missing feature is, it was in BB1.\n\n2. They just made up some random rules, so the BB game that has been tested for 20 years apparently was no good so they just made some tweaks withouit checking with the community.  BB rules are like scripture to BB players, dont mess with them.\n\n3. You have to do about 10x more clicking than in BB1 to do your moves\n\n4. Leagues need fixing\n\n5.

I've become an admin of a popular league and have spent hours trying different ways to build teams. This is my view of Blood Bowl 2 from a veteran of the game.\n\nBlood Bowl 2 is Cyanide's recreation of the original Blood Bowl games under a new engine. The graphics and UI are great and this new adaption makes it much easier for new players to get into the game. The tutorial does an alright job of explaining the game and mechanics, even if it could be improved and may be a little too slow.\n\nPeople complain about the lack of variation in cheerleaders and crowd but really how much do you care about that? They complain because it's not in the game and when it is they won't give it a second thought. The thing that matters most about Blood Bowl is the gameplay. After a shaky start with some skills not being optional or not being in the game Cyanide has done a good job with listening to the community and fixing the problems (hard to believe I know). Some people have noticed some bugs but I personally have had no problems.\n\nWhile there is a notable lack of a good single player as the campaign is largely a long tutorial, Blood Bowl was meant for multiplayer anyways. In NAF (COL) there is a wide variety of skill levels and tv so it's very good for practice, however the best way to play BB is in a league setting and that's where most of my experience will come from. Find a good group of people and have some set match times and you will have a blast with this game.\n\nThe biggest downside of BB2 right now is the lower number of teams and I hope Cyanide picks up the pace with releasing them but that doesn't detract from the overall gameplay too much.\n\nIf you don't care about the graphics or ui and just want a wide variety of teams, then by all means go play BB1. However if you want a more pleasing experience then buy BB2 as it has an insane amount of potential once more teams are released and giving your support will only make it better.","January 9","true","298.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

And (quite often really) they will come up while you are doing something important... and salt will flow.\n\nWhen this came out I would have recommended it to new players anyway, but since the last patch I would say this game vastly trumps BB1 by cyanide. The only remaining niggles are minor and hopefully being fixed, with the up coming 4 new races being given to anyone who buys before they come out, now seems like a good time to get this game.\n\nIt's not a totally faithful copy of the last set of rules and there are still some things they say they will add, but if you want that there's a free java client called fumbble that has a perfect copy of the rules. If you want to have fun and enjoy a good looking version of bb. this is it.","January 1","true","501.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

Not graphically, or in the sound department, both are pretty well fleshed out for what they are. Gameplay holds very stable, especially if you arriving from the first one. The percentages that it now displayed is unchanged from the old system Blood Bowl chaos edition did with the dice to a much easier to get d6 that was confusing to many players first starting.\n\nThe issue primarily plaguing this game is its meta. This is a very well rough spot, for its role as fantasy football. You  play based on defined styles from the race you choose. Currently, one aspect of the team in question here has reached a nasty point of contention within the community. The defenders of this are going to tell you "Play a different team." when you encounter this team makeup. Normally, this is a fine aspect. The team in question has a means to do this, and its used to deal with certain persisting aspects of your team after the game. And losing half to three quarters of a team you spent time and energy into because of this matchup.\n\nDeath happens in this game for some teams, death happens alot more for others. But when you get roaming kill teams to face that exist to ruin your game, rather then win, is it a good thing? And that is the big problem right now to why I can't recomend this game. Cyanide is starting to give the tools to make sure you can avoid losing your team to this, but you cant avoid it fully yet. If it goes through, i'd gladly change my review to positive.\n\nBut anyhow, have a good day.\n\nIf you are reading this, then you've either crawled to where it was vote bombed down, or looking to reviews.

Everything from league management over team management to actual playing in leagues and competitions comes with better and clearer UI and is much more user friendly than Blood Bowl 1 with its horribly dated and janky interface.\n\nIt comes with 8 races and comparing that to Chaos Edition is a little ridiculous as Chaos Edition was the 4th RERELEASE of the original Blood Bowl, the basic version of which also came with 8 races.\n\nIf you are in it for the singleplayer you can still get basic randomized competitions and a story campaign featuring the Reikland Reavers. This campaign also includes a tutorial which means the first couple of matches aren't "real" Blood Bowl matches but ones with simplified rules. Toward the end the difficulty really rises up though and it's a neat story with a lot of memorable characters from the Blood Bowl lore.  All in all the Singleplayer is perhaps not as fulfilling as the offering in Blood Bowl 1, I can't really comment on that much because I don't play this game for its Singleplayer or GW's ridiculous "lore".\n\nOne thing that Blood Bowl 2 is not however is a buggy mess like Blood Bowl 1 was for years. A fact that all the Chaos Edition fanboys seem to conviniently forget.","December 22, 2015","true","34.6"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

The multiplayer is really the bread and butter of the game though, with an in-depth league system (still waiting on individual player stats) I felt for my players and did my best to keep them alive and well because death is permanent, even in online play.\nP.S.

I understand it's a dice game, I understand its random. However today this happened.\n\nMy LVL6 Witch Elf, with sure footed, on elf turf to mitigate injury, died while going for it.\nYes I had 2 Apothecaries because I was playing against Dwarves, however.\nBefore I had the chance to use the Apoth the game crashed.\nBecause this game is an unfinished pile of trash (and that's being kind).\nYou still can't, in twenty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fifteen, log back into a match after disconnect.\nSo I have uninstalled and will never play a BB game again.\n\nEven ignoring this situation, the game has a plethora of other problems, bugs, compatibility issues, connection stability etc.\n\nCurrently as of the time of this review only 1200 (as if that isnt already an indication not to buy) people are playing BB2 at peak time. I dont play at peak time, neither does the majority of the planet. I'm forced to play EURO and US players from SEA and wait 20-30 per movement while the server catches up. Also if this causes a DC, you cant get back into your match. That is unacceptable.\n\nI'm not even going to get into gameplay and balance. Suffice to say all you need to do is check every single league leader board and see undefeated Chaos and Lizardmen on every one. Most of their victory's come from concedes by the way (you can check). Since nobody wants to struggle keeping players alive rather than playing the damn game. The perma death and injury system has driven away the entire player base.\n\nI enjoy an amount of randomness in my gaming, it is exciting. However this game is over the top. The amount of chance involved takes away all notion of a skilled player having an effect on the outcome of a game. You always do the most sensible stuff possible to succeed and still get ♥♥♥♥ed over by rolls.\n\nIF this game were more along the lines of X-Com, where a skilled player can have an actual impact on keeping important pieces alive, then I would continue playing. This game does not give you that chance. Your best players can die from the most simple and likely to succeed action. That is ridiculous and makes this game feel more like a chore than anything else.\n\nAll that is left here are the bash team trolls.

First a word of warning to those reading reviews there are two bits of misinformation i have seen on this steam page and i want to point that out real quick.\n\n1. Blood bowl 2 does not have fewer races it has the exact same amount has blood bowl 1 so watch out for dishonesty there as they both started with 8.\n\n2. Blood bowl 2 does not have day one dlc the lizardmen and wood elf teams were not finished when the game was (also they are not part of the originial BB2 8 bringing the total to 10 whenever they are added)\n\nAnyways now that thats out of the way here is my take and first the good.\n\n•Graphically this game is a massive improvement it is absolutely gorgeous in comparison to the graphics of the rather aging blood bowl 1.\n\n•The UI though is bar far the biggest improvement and in ever way both the games menu system and the in match ui are simply astounding i think it would not be unfair to call it a 100% improvement over the originial where the UI was the most dodgey aspect of the game.\n\n•The information, this may sound odd but blood bowl one wasn't always that good at telling you what was going on. Blood bowl 2 gives you easy to find data and critical info like the chance to dodge or pass or catch.\n\n•The next big mention is the multiplayer in blood bowl 1 getting into and setting up leagues was a hassle and now it is rather seamless.\n\n•It is also worth mentioning this game performs exceptionally well in fact it strangely enough peforms better then blood bowl 1, i get a more steady framerate from it then i did from its originial at the time. (not to mention you can actually alt tab thank god...)\n\n•Lastly the attention to detail is really good, everything feels visceral from the animations to the quality work of the models and the envrioment.\n\nNow for the Bad.\n\n•There is some missing fluff, the biggest place i have seen this is in the lack of race specific cheerleaders. I would consider this a minor con as to be honest in all my years of playing blood bowl i rarely ever cared about cheerleaders they often aren't worth the investment. So i can understand why the dev team put less of a focus on them given that the playerbase largely ignores them. Its also worth noting you get to have your own stadium which helps to replace that home team feel that the cheerleaders sometimes provided.\n\n•I have also heard there is no visual progression outside mutations for leveling up players though i cannot confirm that yet  and that is about all the bad i have found.\n\n\nNow the iffy.\n\n•Bretonians instead of Goblins. It's hard to say if this is a good thing or a bad thing. On one hand goblins offered a unique style of play centered around cheating. Currently no team really offers that in the same way (except for the dwarfs but that is a stretch). The other side of the coin is the fact that goblins are not a competitive team but a "fun" team where as Bretonians are clearly a competitive team.\n\n•So im tossing this one up to opinion, if you wanted more competitive teams in the initial roster then goods news for you! If you were hoping for more "slapstick" teams in the roster then i am sad to say you will have to wait for anything beyond dwarves.","September 22, 2015","true","38.1"," 31 of 57 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","31","57","0","0"

If you don't know what that is, Blood Bowl is a hybrid turn-based sports-strategy game based in the Warhammer Fantasy world. The game itself has quite a steep learning curve, is heavily reliant on luck, and is quite unforgiving. Yet it's also hugely addictive. There's few feelings as satisfying as executing a carefully constructed game-plan, or pulling off the unlikliest string of dice-rolls to get you out of a jam. Success is never guaranteed, meaning even the best teams and players can lose.\n\n+ the graphics are great. They're not normally a big deal for me, but the quality of them (compared with Chaos Edition especially) and the action-cam on knock-downs gives the game a much more intense feel than BB:CE often had. The character models are pretty great, though it would have been nice if they changed as players levelled up, as in BB:CE.\n\n+ some of the commentary is genuinely laugh-out-loud funny. To paraphrase one of my favourite examples: "There's only two things I hate; racists, and ****ing High Elves!"\n\n+ the community is, on the whole, friendly and welcoming. I'm yet to run in to anyone on multiplayer who left me with a bad feeling, which is rare in games as focused on multiplayer as this. Just don't complain that dice rolls are fixed when you roll double-skulls, reroll, and hit double-skulls again. They're not fixed, Nuffle just doesn't like you.\n\n+ the AI teams are better when compared with BB:CE. Players have more realistic skill-sets, and they play a bit better than in BB:CE. Not by much, and it will never come close to a human opponent, but for someone who played a lot of single-player on BB:CE, the improvement is noticable, even if the AI still does do some dumb moves at times.\n\nNeutal:\n\n~ the campaign seems to take an age to get going, working as more an extended tutorial, and can ask for some very odd conditions for victory in matches.\n\n~ developing your own stadium and giving it special bonuses is a nice, but small touch.\n\nNegatives:\n\n- far fewer races at launch than in BB:CE. The lack of 'stunty' teams is especially disappointing (speaking as someone who loved the chaos goblins could inflict, even if they barely ever won a match). New teams are set for release as time goes by, with the devs giving them for free to people who already own the game, but it's the biggest negative about Blood Bowl 2. No Undead (at the time of writing) is a big miss, too.\n\n- some signs of laziness/rushing in a few areas - some dialogue doesn't fully match up with what's happening, character models are heavily repeated for the crowd, no race-specific cheerleaders. Small points ultimately, but it means the game lacks a bit of polish.\n\nI've found myself playing this over BB:CE since I brought it (even if it means I can't play as my beloved goblins). Which version you pick up depends on which teams you want to play against/as. But, assuming they keep adding teams, then I recommend Blood Bowl 2 over BB:CE. If I had to score it, I'd probably give it a 7/10.","March 23","true","63.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The new UI conveys information much more clearly. An added campaign mode holds the new coach's hand with a series of games that gradually introduce the more advanced concepts of Blood Bowl.\n\nThe negatives I can see have nothing to do with the game itself.  Blood Bowl 2 is not an action game. It is a recreation of the tabletop down to the dice rolls.   Do not purchase the game thinking it plays something like mutant league football.  Also understand that while there are open leagues for matchmaking, Blood Bowl is not balanced for perpetual leagues with many players.  The structure of open online makes it very easy to make "overpowered" teams.  If you do play, your time will be better spent in player-organized leagues where you can learn the game and build up rivalries.","January 22","true","22.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The new button layout, once you get used to it, is superior and actually makes sense now. Be careful switching between both versions; misclicks happen. I love the new stadium options, allowing you to customize your team's pitch. It reminds me of the special play cards in the TT game. I'm not as in love with the new graphics as the general opinion seems to be; there's a lot to like but not everything. The stadiums are pretty, but the new larger overlay is what you see most of the time, and that's the same for all pitches. The fans all have the same face. The uniforms look more similar to eachother, and as has been pointed out many times, do not change as a player advances. However, there are some real highlights. The new CW helmets are fantastic. The troll-slayer has a great, eager look to him when he moves. The troll's jaw is excellent. There are tons of these tiny nifty details. The GUI is better too, with clear and obvious choices on rerolls, apoth, bribe, and such. The on screen information during play is a weakness, as the skills are now icons and some of the team info is obscured. I like the new version and I hope they address some of the issues, which would seem to be easy fixes in most cases.","May 28","true","93.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

That is one thing and does not necessarily display the quality of the game. Apart from looking better, BB2 also is lot more stable. I haven't discovered flaws like not being able to switch players during set up before kick-off (happened a lot for me in BB) or the AI just doing nothing. Sure, this AI could also be better, on the other hand, for average Joes like me, it increases the fun factor (by decreasing the frust factor). The campaign might be short, but it is quite entertaining. It definitely is much better in BB2 than in BB. Some others complain about lacking features like design of players and teams; well, as average Joe, this is neglectible.

Love Games Workshop worlds and games. Really liked the updated graphics, but the interface is the first disappointment... It's NOT intutive. I think it's fine with some experimenting or letting people choose other setups, but you shouldn't be forced to "learn" their new setup.\nSingle player campaign is... very stretched out... and too short... How is that possible? Well it introduces one rule per game pretty much, which means that to players who know Blood Bowl you're basically playing one extremely long tutorial. And then short; because after the campaign itself you can only make single player leagues. No progression or different tournaments as in the first Blood Bowl.\n\nThen the REALLY big letdowns:\n1. 6 or so races? WHAT? And extra races at around 1/6 of the full price game per race is just outrageous?! When I found this out, I tried to get my money back, but you can only do that after playing a max of 2 hrs... So having played a bit more, well...\n2. Extremely counterintuitive setup of leagues. Why is there only one way to do everything. I mean... It's horribly set up. Really. Never seen a setup I had such a hard time figuring out how to get through.\n3. WHY can't you set up more than one player managed team in an offline league with computer teams. A lot of players asked for this as an update to the first game and they didn't introduce it in this sequel.\n\nIn summary: Don't buy unless you don't mind eventually having paid something like 90+ dollars / euros for all the races AND you only want to play online leagues.\n\nSo disappointed...","November 7, 2015","false","51.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

Two games are never quite the same thanks to the RNG brought by a system built on a d6 but it still manages to be quite fun to play, especially if you have a group of friends that get it like I have. We have our own little league and make our own schedules to play each other and all watch each game and have a blast at the hilarity that is Blood Bowl. Really stepped it up since release with the upcoming release of 4 new races (to be given free to anyone who owns the game before their release) and much needed QoL changes in-game. I only see this improving as the Devs listen to their community.\n\nAs for my criticisms, the fault lies within the core aspects of the game itself. Blood Bowl at its heart seems to only support two styles of play: Smash or Pass. With teams like Chaos being built as their single purpose to destroy teams, it seems to go against the grain of ever needing to score. Why bother when you can just kill the enemy team?

Some might say that Blood bowl Chaos edition is way better because it has more races and such, but i find this to be more enjoyable since Chaos-editions UI was absolute garbage to be honest. This is like when films went from black and white to colors, sure the films itself might not have gotten better but its much more enjoyable with colors in my opinion.\n\nKeep in mind this game is not for everybody. It is in the sports genre, but it is wayyyy more tactictal than what you might expect.\n\nThe cult following this game has is deserved, doesnt matter if you play chaos edition or this you just cant deny that Blood bowl is a good game.","December 18, 2015","true","78.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The graphical updates are much appreciated and after some support post-launch I think the game in general is the best way to play Blood Bowl in video game form. It's super fun and value for moeny for sure given how long each game is. The races included are pretty core, and generally, I don't find myself MASSIVELY missing any races from Chaos Edition for the most part. Furthermore, with the announcement of 4 new races, most of which are pretty interesting, and all of which are going to be free on PC, and the current DLC, both of which are good value on sale, the race pool is going to be pretty decent by the end of next year, with my only big miss being Amazon. Overall, if you want to play Bloodbowl, I think this is the new standard edition for PC. Chaos Edition still has it's advantages, but I personally would play this version for sure.","December 18, 2015","true","50.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It’s a pretty accurate digital version of the great board game launch way back when and if you learn to laugh at your misfortune and you’ll enjoy it even more (the game has a habit of seeming to deliberately undo your best laid plans with unlucky dice rolls, lol).\nThe campaign is simple, but a good intro to the mechanics of the game. Treat it as an extended tutorial rather than the main feature of the game. The AI customisable single-player leagues are decent, but the AI isn’t sophisticated enough to try those desperate plays in the late stages of the game, and thus becomes a bit predictable.\nThe multiplayer is where the real fun is to be had. There are a bunch of leagues you can enter and the community is normally made up of decent people (as with any game you’ll find the sore losers and those that just constantly complain about their “bad” luck… but for the most part people are friendly).

The aim of the game is pretty simple, players need to score the most Touchdowns!! Of course, it’s not as simple as that however, as there are increasingly-difficult teams standing in your way. Timing your run as well as creating the right situation to give your team the advantage, all while a timer is counting down, is crucial to whether or not you end up scoring those Touchdowns!! And lest not forget the repetitive failed dice rolls, which will be something that people will hate.\n\nThat being said, the game looks great and plays well. I do recommend it to anyone, so long as you have a little patience and a handle on your temper, failed dice rolls will make you scream at your monitor.","February 19","true","77.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Kind of a mouthful right?  It works suprisingly well though.\n\nThis game is almost less of a sequal than a graphics and UI overhaul of the first game.  The game itself is functionally identical in terms of gameplay, but all the peripheral portions have been improved.  The UI is now easy to use and mostly intuitive (if you assume that should just be a given, play the first game and weep).  The graphics are not just functional as they were in the original, but actually quite good with cutscenes showing the action and giving a visceral thrill when your minotaur curb stomps a dwarf.  Full game pad support.  The team manager has more depth and it's now easy to almost instantly create custom leagues to play in.  You also now have the ability to trade your players online to other people which is just an interesting feature.\n\nOne of the largest improvements is the addition of an actual tutorial in the form of the campaign.  It's a little slow but actually tells you what does what as opposed to the original blood bowls method of, "Just click around and hope for the best."  The campaigns narrative is also charmingly silly which is a plus.\n\nGiven the longevity of the previous game the community is going to be extremely active for some time as well, so that's another bonus.\n\nNow this is not a game for everyone.  Like any authentic adaptation of a games workshop title, die rolls are king and you will inevitably end up cursing at your screen as what should have been a sure thing somehow turns into disaster.  If you've never called the RNG a ♥♥♥♥ing cheater, then you haven't actually played a games workshop title.  With that said though, the opposite can occasionally happen too, and it feels amazing.\n\nThe only real downside is that the previous incarnation of blood bowl had 23 races, this has 8 (and doesn't have the undead, which was my favorite you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s!)  The difference will be made up in DLC's which, depending on your preference is either fine or, to use the the langauge of the forum screamers, a bloodsucking scam that even EA would be ashamed of.  Personally I'm ok with it, and would rather have the game right now to play than wait however long it would be to get all the other races out simultaneously, but it nevertheless IS a negative.  This is a Null issue to new comers to the game but blood bowl 1 vets will probably feel like thier choices have been severely cut back.\n\nOn the whole it's a pretty game that is silly fun and a lot more welcoming to new players than the first.  Buy it, Play it, cripple a scaven and laugh.  It's good times.  8/10","September 22, 2015","true","24.8"," 24 of 44 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","24","44","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/christianlabor/recommended/236690/","christianlabor","Christian Labor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/christianlabor/","16 products in account","As a long time player of tabletop games related to this genre, I was drawn into this game by some fun videos on YouTube.\n\nI wish the general community was as fun as the people who play on YouTube...\n\nPros - GW has a real knack for a sort of gallows humor and tongue in cheek style that somehow manages to be both dark and silly at the same time. It lends itself well to games that actually grew out of war simulations. The two narrators are entertaining, as GW characters are wont to be, and Cyanide I feel did a wonderful job capturing the flavor of the game.\n\nCons -\n\n1. The UI is clunky. There is no entirely safe way to plan your moves. Misclicks result in anything from having to start all over to having your player throw the ball across the field when you did not intend it.\n\n2. The teams are not particularly well balanced. This goes back to it being a GW game. GW, for those of you now aware, stands for Games Workshop. This is a company that just abandoned a decades old wargame franchise seemingly specifically to spite a sector of their customer base they apparently considered harmful for their sales.\n\nWe'll see how that works out. Meantime, Blood Bowl 2 sports a handful of the teams available in the semi-official (I.E. not at all supported by GW for decades now) tabletop rules. Skaven are all but unplayable. Chaos seem to rule the leagues based on the fact that they have access to an entirely separate set of upgrades that other races can only rarely access (mutations). Skaven can get them fairly easily too, but Skaven die in higher levels in truckloads with an armor value of 7 even on front line players. As the game rewards survival of multiple games heavily, Skaven and other low armor, high finesse teams find it hard to compete at higher levels of play. At least one private league now invites ONLY finesse teams into its league to avoid the devestation the high armor and high strength teams visit on their weaker cousins.\n\nThere is no cure for this imbalance in sight. My experience with GW - players and designers alike - is that making the game balanced and competative is not really high on their list of things to do. Wonder if Cyanide can break that trend? So far, the answer is no.\n\n3. The graphics are pathetic. This game offered little in the way of graphics to begin with. It is a standard sort of top down view with very clunky camera control. But to make matters worse, players move about stiffly, often ending up somewhere other than where you aimed them only to slip into place like a loose block, and the handful of full screen animations that pop up typically sport part of one player poking through the other player because of bad positioning of the camera and/or models during the animation render.\n\nAt one point the game reversed the team uniforms between my Skaven and the opposing Skaven team...?\n\nIn short, just old fashioned sloppy graphics and animation work.\n\n4. The community is not nearly as friendly as the YouTube videos that seem to be the main marketing arm for the game would lead you to think.\n\nSummary: Nice idea, but the execution is predictably pathetic as GW tends to just pawn its IP off to whoever is willing to fork over the money and let the chips fall where they may. There has never in the history of GW been anything remotely resembling quality control as far as their game rules go. They make wonderful miniatures and great game fluff, but horribly horrible games. And their company is quite obviously struggling because of it.\n\nIn any event, I would definitely not recommend this game. The lack of balance between the teams and the clunky UI have left me entirely uninterested in continuing play, and like so many GW fans, the player base seems to be a bunch of rabid dogs whose main function in life is to convince people to play games with them by treating them like crap and pretending there's nothing wrong with the game's design or execution.\n\nCaveat - There are those who accuse me of being "Sausage fingered". I seem to do well enough in pretty much every other video game I play though. I'm pretty sure this is just the typical GW fanboy reaction to anything negative you ever say about their games, but in the interest of fairness, there are apparently people who just LOVE the UI. I can't imagine why, and they are none too communicative as to WHY they think the UI rocks, but there you have it.\n\nMaybe my fingers turn to sausages specifically for GW games.","December 25, 2015","false","48.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","2"

The negative recommendation is related to saving.\n\n1. You cannot save in the middle of a match. Period.

The first one was hard because you were taking a bloody 900 rated team and bashing it into a 1200 rated team. This game is hard because you take your 1400 rated team and play a 1000 rated team and you watch as every.single. roll. goes thier way. I'm all for RNG and it adds a lot of complexity to the gameplay but whatever bonus there is to the ai rolls is absolutely infuriating at times.\nIts annoying to watch as your player gets tripped twice and you waste a re-roll, and then have the ai Magically move 6 players with no problem with a 33% chance or lower each move. To me this kills the original base for playing the game. Whats the point of spending time strategizing how to protect the carrier when the 1 opponant who magically gets by the 4 defenders ko's him and when i have the ai carrier completely surrounded, lone behold its like 50/50 if he actually goes down.\nThere is an astounding lack of content for the price.\nCustomization is at an all time low. Individual player customizations are only a handful and team customization is almost non existent. What could be considered "customization" is procedural stadium upgrades and additional dlc.\n\n\nIf this title was 15$ I would say yeah give it a go, but as it's currently priced its a massive dissapointment.\n\nSome Ideas that would make me feel like I actually spent my money well.\n1. This game has a huge cult following.Open up the game to the steam workshop and let the players help you create the customizable content for the teams,players, and stadiums.

Frustrating at times but not as unfair as some make it sound. It's so nice to have the computer make all the calculations for you and present them in what I find a pretty clear way. The UI could probably be improved but I find it very efficient already.\n\nThe campaign is quite fun (even though it's for human/empire team only)  and a good intro to the game mechanics.

Amongst other things, it feels more epic. Thankfully we no longer have to play matches In an empty field or on a stupid boat!\n\nAlso, I can get a random match always within seconds. True, the open league has its own issues, but that's another conversation entirely. With Chaos Edition I would have to set the matchmaker going and go off and do something else instead. More often than not it wouldn't even find me an opponent. Really frustrating.\n\nSure, BB2 isn't  perfect. It needs more races, especially to keep the Chaos teams a bit more under control. Thankfully the new teams that are on their way should do that. Personally, all my favorite  teams are already in the game (apart from maybe Norse), so I can't really complain.\n\nWould like to see race/specific cheerleaders, and some variation on the crowd members when a player is surfed.\n\nWould also like to see player models develop as players earn levels.

I am more of a D20 player, myself, but I've always admired Warhammer and its sheer level of depth despite the mechanical simplicity. I love Games Workshop if for no other reason that they have a VAST library of video games within the Warhammer franchise. It's difficult to find players for tabletop matches, let alone be willing to teach/learn all of the mechanics and nuances of the variety of games. PC gaming, especially, opens the doors for AI battles and relative ease of access to real opponents. Bloodbowl, and other Warhammer games have given me a workaround to play against enthusiasts and novices alike without having to memorize too many new rules.\n\nThat said, if you're a Turn-based strategy player, you're already well aware of the potential heartbreak of RNG. And Bloodbowl 2 is no exception. There are moments where it's baffling how an opponent can dodge so effectively, even if the odds of failure are only 1/6. Times where clutch plays are thwarted by that dumbass rolling double 1's and dropping the ball.\n\nThe rules are very simple, and compared to the first Bloodbowl game, much more accessible and novice-friendly. The UI improvements are substantial and the graphics and audio are fun, and fitting. The announcers are great, and when they grow stale, the option to turn off the audio (or down) is available.\n\nDespite simplicity, the depth of strategy is excellent. I truly didn't think, while playing the tutorial, that it could reach the level of complexity to keep me stumped during a turn. But risk/reward in this game feels very tangible, and the violent, dark-humor atmosphere is simply perfect.\n\nI hope there will be future DLC or expansions that add additional customization options, however. They are pretty lackluster. And, to avoid aforementioned repetitive audio, record additional announcer voiceovers. Perhaps even a variety of announcers.\n\nTL:DR:\n\nFun. Great audio. (Needs a decent sountrack). Strategy layer and UI exceptional.","March 12","true","86.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's played on a grid and honestly there's a lot of rules to go over. Fortunately you can read it all yourself if you google "crp bloodbowl" or "lrb6 bloodbowl".\n\nThat said the campaign will do an ok job of slowly introducing rules to you as you stomp on the necks of fantasy races while moving a spikey ball around the pitch.\n\nFull disclosure this game has a lot of random chance in it, in fact the game is basically a puzzle game where you try to minimize random chance while trying to score. BB2 doesn't have all the teams that the tabletop game has, but it does have bretonians as a new race (and they're balanced nicely in with the tabletop teams). So yeah, compared to BBCE you have less races, but there's more daily games of bloodbowl in bb2 than even on fumbbl (a free java based bloodbowl client) so if you want to mash games against (in my opinion) cool people, then bb2 is the way to go.\n\n\nHopefully I'll see you on the pitch, and remember:\n\nFLASH FLASH FLASH LUCKER NOOB","December 23, 2015","true","167.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It's only flaw was the lack of multiplay in season mode. So I've been waiting anxiously for BB2. Now that I've played it for about 60 hours, I have a mixed feeling with it.\n\nThe game is basically Blood Bowl 1 with updated graphics and multiplay. That isn't a bad thing. BB1 already had everything in place. First complaint comes from single player campaign, as you can play it only with human team. After playing through the campaign, I started coaching my own team online. And there was the games' major problem. I had bought the game and both DLC teams, so I knew the team options are going to be limited. In fact, it almost crippled the whole game. I really miss the Norse or Amazon teams, as those were my favourite in BB1. Also, knowing that I have to pay even more in future to get more teams pisses me off.\n\nIf you liked BB1 as a game, youre gonna like BB2 also. So ask yourself which is more important to you:\n\n1) Lots of different teams to choose from, but multiplaying only as hotseat\nor\n2) Improved graphics and possibility to play online, but (very) limited selection, of different races/teams\n\nIf you chose option 1, I suggest you continue playing BB1 and wait BB2 discount offer . If you chose option 2 and don't mind paying extra for more teams, go ahead and buy this game.\n\n*If you are an experienced Blood Bowl player, you may want to add me.. ;)","April 17","true","89.5"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","2"

There's definitely a bunch of fun to be had with friends here: from a pure strategy level, the game does bring the challenge in several ways in a back and forth chess match. The game has definitely been improved from the original, as the UI implementation has made a lot of necessary changes to make the game more accessible to the average gamer. But the game's core design has a couple of things that will cause massive frustration for players, as a lack of customization in leagues, options that seem to be missing, and the dreaded RNG element of the game will drag the game down while it's attempting to take off. This game hits a niche for strategy elements that's for sure, and sadly, I can recommend it as a sale title for the general public, but a good title to have for strategy enthusiasts who like the subject matter, and people who are willing to take a hit or two while playing through the game's randomization element.\n\nGameplay Footage and Video Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDlA9ie3oY0\n\nLists:\n\n+:\nOn a pure strategy level, the game works in a chess like manner very, very well. Two coaches going at it on an intellectual level will really turn it into a battle of wits.\nThe game feels a bit balanced in terms of overall aggressive/defensive gameplay, and that several strategies will be viable.\nUI vastly improved from Blood Bowl 1. Lot easier to see what's going on and what your options are. A lot easier to see exactly what is going on then in the previous game.\nDifferent classes play reasonably and give you a reason to try them all to see what works for you. While races may play similarly, you can really get deep into the customization of your team through varies of ways in player progression.\nPunishes for staying in the endzone and sidelines, good design in making them punishing places to be.\nSkill system can take away the RNG element a bit and really adds a level of depth to the game.\nCampaign eases you into the mechanics of the game, and despite some confusion caused because of the changing concepts, it did the job reasonably well.\nThe announcers stand out, especially in the campaign mode. Good situational humor and the two voice actors do a fantastic job of bringing them to life.\nCharacter models look good, especially with mutation system to make characters stand out on the field.\n-:\nThe game's RNG is brutal, to the point where those who dislike random elements in games will find themselves screaming at the dice. Percentages may be misleading, as in real play it seems like there's differences from what is listed.\nLack of customization for rules in leagues, and the ability to tweak matches so that both sides play a game that they'd prefer over the basic rule set. Really need to emphasize this: this could have gone a long way to taking away the grievances that I had.\nLack of options. Games can feel really really slow, and really wanted a way to speed them up. While I appreciate a couple of the camera/UI options added, overall the game feels bare on the PC options as a whole.\nProgression system really feels like a grind at times. To make your team the way you want, expect to grind a bit, and even more when they eventually die or retire.\nSometimes it isn't clear why a skill didn't work, even though at the bottom of the screen, you can see why.\nAudio Lines get repetitive over time, it needed more variety here to take advantage of the improved presentation and great voice acting.\nClipping issues unfortunately pop up several times in close ups, and can make the technical precision of the game stand out in a bad way.\nUnder the hood (when slowed down or stuttering), you can see some corners cut on animation.\nWished mouse input when using windowed mode did not register clicks outside the context of the  window.\nA couple of graphical bugs would show up from time to time.","September 29, 2015","true","17.3"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","12","22","0","0"

The only hugely significant edge that Chaos edition has is that it has more races (specifically the most of the lower tier races).  While Blood Bowl 2 doesn't have all the races, it has most of the higher tier races and still enough variety that I haven't played through all of them yet myself.  Here are some of the things that I appreciate that may not be obvious from seeing the trailers and screenshots.\n\n1.  The ability to rewind, pause, and skip in replays.\n2.

I personaly feel that on its release the price was a bit high but where the price settled is a good price.\n\nReason for purchasing the game.\n\nI\'m new to bloodbowl and I found playing the first game not easy to learn and the graphics were pretty poor, blood bowl 2\'s UI is easy to understand, and the models and characters are better then anything id be able to paint myself and look awesome.\n\nI\'d like to remark on some of the more negative posts.\n\nCampaign just a tutorial:\nThis is true, but if any of the people complaining about this had played for more then 40 mins they would have found at match 9 thats %48 campaign completion its pretty much a normal solo league, with a story and the training wheels are fully off.\n\nCampaign only for one race:\nFrom memory campaign in blood bowl 1 was effectivly this games solo league so I dont see where the probem is.\n\nDLC is a cash grab:\nI don\'t see it this way, we get 8 races that are well fleshed out for a good price. $4 - $10 for a DLC team depending on what part of the world you live in, is a good price. Look at it this way you would never be able to buy and paint a blood bowl tabletop team for $10, just saying.\n\nGraphics arent any better then the original:\nThe people who say this must be running the game on toasters, the game has been made on a brand new engine and is immensly better, easiest way to see this is pretty much looking at the steam pages for both.\n\nLesser issue, responding to artificial coach leveling:\nThis is why there will never be a local hotseat league mode with experiance for your coach, too many people would just cheat to level up their coach. a.k.a Artificial leveling making teams that only one person plays to just roll over and lose to your main team thus getting better exp for your coach.","May 31","true","36.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As this is based on a board game, everything that happens is based on die rolls. Nuffle (n. from ancient entity called "NFL." God of dice and chance) is sometimes completely against you. I have lost games because of malevolent dice, but I have also won that way. Your players sometimes can't pick up the ball when it's just laying there on the ground not moving.\n\nThat said, it's a strategy game that's loosely based on Football. And you get to play as Lizardmen (Note: DLC). You bite, kick, punch, and generally batter the other team into submission, then casually waltz into the end zone for a single point.       It's sort of like turn based Mutant-League Football, only more violent. And you get to play as Lizardmen.\n\nAlso, for some reason, the plural form of Saurus in this game is Saurus.

I can say that I really like this game. I Haven't played multiplayer yet but this game has high ratings so I'm confidant that multiplayer will be good. If you were a fan from the last Bloodbowl computer game, you will understand that multiplayer wasn't the problem. Bloodbowl on single player was to easy and it really began to get boring. At first Bloodbowl 2 seemed the same but as my team developed, the games started to become much harder and I had to really struggle to win. I am hoping it will stay this way. I still  sure you that Bloodbowl 2 is harder then the original. Campaign mode on Bloodbowl 2 is a little disappointing though. On this mode you have to be the Reikland Reavers and you have to go through a long gaming tutorial even if your familiar with the game. Apart from that, no more real problem.

This is fair, but completely glosses over the fact that Blood Bowl is an amazing game that has been going strong for over 20 years and is well represented in Blood Bowl 2. The missing features will come with time, but this is still a great way to play a great game.\n\n--\n\nI picked up the game in Jan 2016, and I belive it's been patched a few times since launch. I'm a BB fan from back in the day, and came to this after recently playing a few games on fumbbl. I was convinced after watching streamers play the Crendorian Invitational which makes for decent e-sports viewing.\n\nThis is a solid, intuitive and playable rendition of Blood Bowl. It's easy on beginners, building up the rules slowly, but caters to old hands by showing you the dice roll log (so you can see how many you missed by when your gutter runner trips over his own feet on the second go for it).\n\nUpsides:\nLooks fantastic\nMade with a decent sense of humour\nEasy for beginners\nGood UI\nSeems to have a solid league system and a decent player base on PC\nPerformance is good (I'm playing on a 2012 iMac using Bootcamp and it works flawlessly).\nDownsides:\nSingle Player campaign built up to the full ruleset too slowly for me (as I know the rules)\nSome deviations from the living rulebook, which is a shame\nUI sometimes lets me down when I make unintentional dodges or GFI\nDevelopers ran out of time and it seems they cut a lot of cosmetic details (e.g. all cheerleaders and fans are human)\nExpensive especially when DLC is included","January 12","true","61.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You have to accept bad dice, they happen, and improve your gameplay so you dont have to roll a lot of dice at all.\nThats said, the game is not for everyone, but it is a matter of taste, not a game problem.\n\n- Campaign and single player are boring/have issues, bugs -\n\nThis is a multiplayer game. End of the line. It gets fun and addictive when you play and win (or lose) agaunst a real person. Play online, single player and campaign are for learning the ropes.\n\n- Multiplayer has bugs, crashes, etc -\n\nThere were some problems in the begginning, mostly fixed by now. You can also return to the game withing 6 minutes after the crash (most of the time anyway). I'd say there are no gamebreaking issues at the moment. Some problems might be related to your particular PC.\n\n- Races as DLC! Price is too high -\n\nYeah, it kinda sucks. But hey it is 60% off as I am writing right now and for 10 bucks it is a steal. Races as DLC - not good, but atleast next 3 races are free and to be honest there are enough of them if you are new to the game.\n\n- It is worse then BB1 -\n\nWell, less races yeah, I agree. But it is visually better and more newbe-friendly. It does not exactly deserve negative review for that, imho\n\nThis is all I can think of at the moment, hope it helps.\n\nSee you on the pitch!","December 26, 2015","true","416.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I very much recommend the game as I venture into multi-player.  No it's not balanced, and yes it has random rolls but it is very strategic.\n\nThey will add teams over time and correct the few bugs in the game.\n\nFor those of you that despise the RNG of the game.  Great games such as backgammon do have a random element, and is the best comparison rather than a game of chess where a superior oponent will always beat an unskilled one.  I do think there is surprising depth so you 'mitigate' those chances of failure so that you stand a very good chance of beating an unskilled oponent.  Some teams do match up poorly versus others as in real football (which this is clarly 'NOT').  If you don't enjoy randomness in the game, this isn't for you.  After 100 hours I'm starting to learn that the ruleset is more complex than I first thought, and I keep learning to improve my game.  It soes suck to play better than an opponent, and suffer bad luck-- but sometimes you do get lucky at the last second to win and tie versus an opponent much better than you.  Over time, it does even out.  Although not for everyone, this is a great turn based strategy game best played against other players.  As a side note, each race is distinct and plays differently which adds replayability to the game.\n\nI'm now an avid fan.","September 28, 2015","true","302.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I own it, and I always wanted to like it, but the seeming overcomplexity of the system kept me from ever getting into it.\n\nBlood Bowl 2 was pretty much the perfect game for me. The UI is clean, simple and easy to understand. The games are pegged at a nice length (usually around 40 minutes for me) and the solo league experience provides enough of a challenge for me as a new blood bowl player to be entirely engrossing. There are a large number of teams (currently eight), though hardcore blood bowl fans will probably be disappointed by the selection. More will almost certainly be released as DLC, but at the $45 price point that's frankly to be expected.\n\nTLDR: If you're interested in a turn based strategy game with a fantasy sports twist this is certainly a game for you. If you're on the fence, or if you're a hardcore blood bowl fan you're probably better served waiting for a sale.","October 6, 2015","true","23.3"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","11","21","0","0"

I think we can all agree that running around a football field with teams full of fantasy races bashing each other while trying to score touchdowns is simply an awesome premise. The game is turn based, which I love, and it involves quite a bit of dice rolling, which makes each match unique and unpredictable. The "turnover" mechanic is brilliant. If you fail an action during your turn and one of your players gets knocked over, then your turn immediately ends.This leads to nailbiting choices like: "Yes, if I make this risky block, I'll score a touchdown. But if my player falls over instead, then my opponent will be in a good position to score. Do I wait for a better opportunity next turn? Or do I go for it now?"\n\nStrategyThere is real strategy to be had here. Manage your odds. Do everything that is safe first in case your rolls go south and end your turn. Learn how to set up block strings and use the all-important once-per-turn "blitz" move. Don't make unnecessary dice rolls. Your strategy will also vary greatly depending on which race you choose to play. Dwarves? Bash up your opponent's players and watch as they are carried off the field on stretchers. High Elves? Look for tiny openings in your opponent's defense and exploit them with your high agility, speed, and passing skills.\n\nGraphicsThe art direction and graphics are first rate. I don't think I'll ever get tired of seeing my ogre (I named him "Slurple") smack down the opposing players. I still laugh out loud when someone fails a "Go For It" roll and goes tumbling to the ground and fumbles the ball. The prat falls and the accompanying sound effects are *perfect*. The person who designed this really knows their stuff.\n\nThe two commentators in the game (Bob and Jim) make me chuckle as well. When my ogre is lying prone on the ground, tries to get up, but misses his "intelligence" roll and goes nowhere, then one of the announcers might claim "I've seen *mushrooms* that look smarter than that."\n\nStabilityThe game is rock solid stable. I have not seen even one crash or freeze up during the 63+ hours I have been playing. I did encounter two bugs involving player lineups and gold inducements, but these were fixed very quickly.\n\nIn the future, I think I would like to see more robust league creation options, as well as an easier way to see what skills players have on the field. The negative reviews I have read are written either by veterans of Blood Bowl 1 who dislike the fact that some of their favorite features are not in the game, by people who do not understand how randomness works, or by people who feel the game is too expensive. Note that there will be additional teams added to the game, but you will need to purchase them at about $7 each if you would like to play as them. The base game comes with eight teams.\n\nIn any case, I am very happy with my purchase and would highly recommend Blood Bowl 2 to anyone who might enjoy turn-based strategy with RNG meshed with football in a high fantasy world.\n\nPlease follow this link if you are a new player and would like to read some helpful guides:\n\nhttp://forum.bloodbowl-game.com/viewtopic.php?f=61&t=5500","September 23, 2015","true","223.5"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","11","21","0","0"

( Its a Dice Game after all)\n\nBut first things first - Is BB2 better than BB1?\n\nKind of, yes. BB2 has a much better look all over the place, the UI is more Userfriendly, the presentation of the stadiums and the teams is awesome, it plays smoother and is just more enjoyable than BB1.\n\nAnd there are so cool details they added, for example if you purchase a Bloodweiser Stand for your Stadium, the crowd is much more pushed and the sound effects of your fans cheering changes aswell, more singing and Vuvuselas all over the place, nice!\n\nThe graphics are great, with cool beating animations and close up cameras if something important happens, really cool and it delivers a nice feeling of being close to the Action.\n\nSo the Game itself, the Programming and Graphics are much better than BB1.\n\nThe most common reason for negative reviews is the lack of Content it has at the Moment.\nAnd that in fact is true, BB1 has much more Content to deliver, but you need to consider that BB1 already has 2 Addons, and compared to the Base Game the Content is the same.\n\nA few not gamebreaking but important things missing aswell, and hopfully will be added soon.\nThe Game lacks in case of Informations, for example no Hall of Fame for your Team, no Player Statistics, no information about Opposing Team pre Match, no Visual change of high lvl Players and so on.\n\nIn my opinion it seems they just where running out of time to implement all those things before release, and im very confident that they will add that kind of things the next few Months.\n\nAdditional Teams will be delivered saperatly as a DLC for 6,99$ each as far is i know, what is a fair price because the teams are really looking awesome.\n\nSo for everybody new to Bloodbowl, BB2 is the better choice. Because it has a better UI and a Singleplayer Campaign wich is in fact a large Tutorial.\n\nTo the Bloodbowl Veterans out there, you want to buy and play Bloodbowl 2 for the same reasons, you played BB1 instead of Fumble. If you want all the Content the BB Lore will offer and all the Statistics and information Possible, play Fumble, its free after all.\nBut if you want a nice looking Bloodbowl expirience that entertains you, just give BB2 a Chance.","October 6, 2015","true","127.6"," 79 of 156 people (51%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","51","79","156","4","8"

This game is very dice heavy and until you learn the rules and how to play properly you will make a lot of mistakes and end up blaming your losses on the dice rather than your own lack of knowledge of the games rules.  However if you like the idea of a complex dice based sports game and don't mind learning the rules then this is the edition to start with.\n\nThe main improvements this game has over the first Blood Bowl are the graphics and the UI, the original game was well known for its awful interface that left new players scared and confused while this one makes it much easier for new players to see the chances of success on things like dodges and ball pick ups.  And quite honestly that is all that this has over the original game, this isn't really that bad a thing as the UI was a serious issue but I feel like more could have been improved such as the multiplayer league system which now has less options that in the first game.\n\nOther things I would like to see improved is the single player AI, in the first game it was woeful and to be honest it is no better in this version.  I have yet to lose a game against the AI and haven't even conceded a single touchdown against it yet.  While this may be good for newer players as it gives them a pretty much braindead AI to practice against it would have been nice to be able to have a challenging single player mode for once.  The multiplayer is still where the meat of the game is and it remains much the same although they have removed the MP lobby that you could use to chat with fellow players before your game and arrange matches etc.\n\nThe number of teams the game was released with is also a bone of contention for some players as it only has 8 plus the two you got from pre-ordering which is far, far less teams than Blood Bowl Chaos Edition has.  This will eventually sort itself out though as Cyanide have said they will be releasing teams as DLC, this is something I am fine with as long as they pricing of said DLC isn't over the top but I know some people hate DLC so much that it ruins games for them so I thought I should mention it.  However the teams the game comes with should be plenty to suit most players but I would have liked to have had the Undead team in there as part of the base races.\n\nThere are also still quite a few technical issues still with the game, it causes my graphics card to overheat and crashes the PC unless I use a frame limiter to limit myself to 30fps which I am not okay with and others have reported similar issues with the overheating in this game while other games run fine.  I have also experienced the black screen bug where your screen just goes black but the game is still running fine, you just can't see it.  As for the in game options menu, it is worfully inadequate, you cannot play in fullscreen at all only borderless windowed mode, which is pretty much the same but seems a bit of an oversight.  The graphics options are practically non existent as well, simply choosing from Low to Very High with no advanced options at all.  While I am sure that these things will be patched you may want to hold off for now if these sound like major issues for you.\n\nI realise that this review reads quite negatively but I do truly enjoy this game and I think that in a few months time with patches and new races being added it will be the best version but it still doesn't quite edge out the first game yet as they have removed features we liked and added a few things that nobody asked for and some that just make it plain worse (player ageing in leagues?)  Honestly though if you are a brand new player who wants to get into Blood Bowl then buy this edition as it is far more user friendly and better looking to boot.  If you are already a seasoned Blood Bowl 1 coach though I would recommend holding fire until they have fixed the worst bugs and maybe added some more teams, though if you are playing for multiplayer you will probably have to buy it anyway since I expect it has already massively reduced the number of people playing the first!","September 27, 2015","true","40.9"," 16 of 31 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","16","31","0","3"

It is completely unfinished and as buggy as the first iteration of Blood Bowl PC, and is a straight downgrade from chaos edition in a lot of ways aside from # of teams. That being said, it will almost certainly be improved a lot in the long-run, just as Blood Bowl 1 was, so if you don't buy it now get it after a few patches for sure, in a sale. It's just a shame they seem to have not learnt much from BB1.\n\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- The league system has been downgraded heavily in choice of options for organizers in almost every way possible, there's no excuse for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on the only thing that keeps people playing your game.\n- Very buggy/some mechanics and skills just flat out do not function as intended (almost as bad as the first game).\n- No grid still\n- Hella expensive\n- 8 teams and it's hella expensive for 8 teams, they're also very vanilla teams, none of the fun/abnormal ones.\n- No aesthetic change on player level up anymore\n- Chance of some dodgy things with Cyans (their in-game currency)\n- Wave goodbye to cool and varied pitches.\n- Game is literally unfinished, still no team specific cheerleaders, only two models in the crowd etc.\n- Can't view opponents team during inducements anymore.\n- Mouse click functions are reversed from the first game. Maddening.\n\nThe Good\n- Good quality spectating, probably the absolute biggest upgrade.\n- Bob and Jim are back, kinda.\n- More new player/idiot friendly. It displays the end % chances for actions as well as the dice.\n- It is prettier.\n- The proposed DLC model for teams is better than expansions and offers far better choice (imo).\n- Better UI (I hesitate to put this here, since the UI is def better in design, but they removed so many features from it to simplify it).\n- Dark Elves look ridiculously more fruity.\n- It's still Bloodbowl, and there's no substitute bug yet.\n- Possiblity of some neat things with Cyans.\n- You can access the options mid-match\n- Lots of small quality of life changes.\n- Praise the sun memes.","September 23, 2015","false","202.6"," 17 of 33 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","17","33","0","1"

Dice can be your friend or your enemy as you're playing the game so don't let it get to you if you get a few bad rolls because sometime soon you'll have amazing rolls.\n\nWe currently have 10 teams in the game which for some reason has people getting very upset because not every team was released out right.

The game works exactly as intended, super fun AI games between those tabletop matches, plays great with a controller. More races would be nice, it's probably in the works, but the 8 races provided really cover most of the play styles. Friendly match with shared or two controllers is great for playing with a buddy and teaching someone how to play.\n\nBUT the textures bug out sometimes? (Shadows of helmets appearing when the helmet is off, block status symbols showing up over and over in a line.) The graphics aren't BAD but they aren't good either. Commentary and bowler audio gets old quick. This game isn't polished. Campaign is a joke, play solo-league for good AI play and team management.\n\nOverall recommend if what you want is the latest version of video Blood Bowl. If you want more races, I've heard good things about Blood Bowl 1 - Chaos Edition. Though I've heard the UI is rougher and it does not have native controller support. If you're unsure what Blood Bowl is, or aren't super excited to play it on a PC, I'd just wait the price out. It's hard to recommend the game at this price unless you really want to play.","October 4, 2015","true","155.6"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","10","20","0","0"

It has 10 teams currently (Wood elves and Lizardmen just added) rather than 25, and it has a new price tag, of course, however, I feel this sells short what Blood Bowl 2 does well.\n\nThe AI has been dramatically improved, which is not thrilling for those who play in human only leagues, but for those of us that play against the AI, this is a big deal. Gone are the days of the AI, as its first action of the turn, trying to dodge through 12 tackle zones and go for it twice as a dwarf. Instead, it seems to do its turn in priority order, from most likely to work to least likely, and it seems to avoid doing bizarre and silly things unlikely to have effect. As elves, it steps out of block zones, forcing you to blitz if you are going to hit it, just like a human would.\n\nAssuming the new races do not cost an arm and a leg, and come out at a fair clip, I think Blood Bowl 2 is going to be a great upgrade on its ancestor.","September 25, 2015","true","102.9"," 11 of 22 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","11","22","0","0"

Game is not perfect by any stretch of the imagination and sort of has a feel of being slightly rushed and incomplete at the moment.  It is a great deal of fun none the less and if like me you grew up playing blood bowl on the tabletop it still feels right.  I will say make sure your focus is multiplayer however as the single player is more than a little bobbins, but if you are a true tabletop gamer what the hell are you playing single player for.....have a word with yourself :P\n\nDice rolls are still frustrating as they were in BB1 but then as someone that once rolled 19 1's out of 24 dice for armour saves on a 2+ with real dice sometimes you just have to smile. The dice gods are fickle and all that jazz!\n\nI don't understand the rage about the races to be honest, the original blood bowl was released with 8 races and this is released with 8 races too with another 2 DLC races to be released soon.  Personally I have only ever played with Dark Elves, Chaos, Orcs and Undead since I was a kid so 3 out of 4 in the initial release I am happy with.  I would rather pay say a few quid for the DLC race I want rather than considerably more for a full expansion with 90% of the races I literally have no interest in.  Everyone will be different in this respect some people will want all the races because they feel incomplete otherwise.  I put that down to my background in the tabletop game, only ever brought, painted and played with teams I wanted to use, had no interest in owning every team, didn't have anywhere near enough money from school holiday jobs to afford them anyway.\n\nWould I recommend this game to everyone?

Have the board game.\n2. Played the first computer game.\n3. Thought the graphics and team editing was cool.\n\nPros\nGraphics - The game looks much better.\nGame play is much better with better bells and whistles.\nWhen you buy your team you can sell players if you need to change things around.  The last game you were stuck after buying the players.  Just remember that after you play a match, you can no longer sell that player for what you got it for.\nComputer AI is way better than the last game.  I had a team knock one of my players out of the pitch.  Never happened in the old game unless I boxed myself in.\n\nCons\nI ordered early and only got 1 of 2 additional races.  I find this shady.  Why not both races?\nThe fully editable teams is a lie.  WHY CAN'T I CHANGE THE PLAYERS NUMBER.  I play humans, love them.  So I want to have my lineman with 50-79, 90-99 numbers, my blitzers 20-49 numbers, catchers 80-89 numbers and throwers 1-19  numbers.\nThe number editor is a HUGE thing for me.  I know it sounds small but i was 100% getting the game for the option of changing numbers.\nThe start of the game and half time is a bit much.\nI wish that knocking your opponent out of the pitch had the race of the person that knocked the other out of the pitch.  It's always humans.\n\nI will play some more and add to this.","September 25, 2015","true","82.4"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

When i got the game i was shocked by how well the tutorial campaign is. They introduces you to the game bit by bit. 1st level there is no rolls, 2nd there are rolls but no turn overs, 3rd there are turn overs, 4th gives u all features but no injuries, etc. they gradually introduce u so its not all thrown at u at once. now once u  u get to the 5th level the campaign sucks because its no longer winning, its dumb objectives like, cripple 5 enemy players.....well that becomes a game of chance with dice rolls. BUT the game isnt about the capaign is about online.\n\nOnline is great, make your team, customize it (i would like more customizing features please), hire players and staff, etc. If a player dies hes gone for good, injured players can be out for a few games....it feels like running a real team. ITs also super smooth and all the teams strengths and weaknesses are clearly displayed.\n\nover all i say its a good game but matches take at least an hour, so be prepared.","October 2, 2015","true","14.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I'm getting alot of play time out of this so far and I'm certain I will get alot more out of it so I'm very happy with the amount of money I spent.\n\nTLDR:\n\ngame is hard but extremely satisfying given the time to learn to play.

It has 10 teams currently (Wood elves and Lizardmen just added) rather than 25, and it has a new price tag, of course, however, I feel this sells short what Blood Bowl 2 does well.\n\nThe AI has been dramatically improved, which is not thrilling for those who play in human only leagues, but for those of us that play against the AI, this is a big deal. Gone are the days of the AI, as its first action of the turn, trying to dodge through 12 tackle zones and go for it twice as a dwarf. Instead, it seems to do its turn in priority order, from most likely to work to least likely, and it seems to avoid doing bizarre and silly things unlikely to have effect. As elves, it steps out of block zones, forcing you to blitz if you are going to hit it, just like a human would.\n\nAssuming the new races do not cost an arm and a leg, and come out at a fair clip, I think Blood Bowl 2 is going to be a great upgrade on its ancestor.","September 25, 2015","true","102.9"," 11 of 22 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","11","22","0","0"

Nothing more.\nThe Solo leagues are boring as hell. In BB1 you had a nice map with different places and you needed to achieve stuff to play the next tournament. Level up your players and buy them equippment. This one here? Nothing. Just a roster.\n\nAll of this could be ignored if the basic game would be at least bug free.  At this state right now, the game could still be a beta.\nOn top of that, its a really bad console port. Just click into the graphics options and you will see it. Not even an option to go full screen or windowed.\nI will get my refund via Steam and leave this dissapointment behind.","September 28, 2015","false","27.3"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","1"

Quite simply, a great muliplayer experience if, and only if, you are a good sport and not a rage quitter. Rather than a basic review, I will point out the differences between this version, and the previous installments.\n\nFirst, there are less races. More are coming, but really, this is a minor problem. You won't see the Halflings, Vampires, Ogres with snotlings, or Goblins. These 4 teams in particular are mostly uncompetitive anyways. More teams are being added and there are enough to keep you busy from the start.\n\nNo single player experience worth mentioning exists. It really didn't exist in the previous version, either. Why? The AI was terrible beyond reason. You could easily win nearly 100% of your games once you knew the holes in the AI. If you check the message boards, players complained endlessly about the AI being stupid. Having a worthless single player campaign in Blood Bowl 2 follows the same trend as its predecessors.\n\nThis game is all about multiplayer. Having an easy cakewalk in the previous games will not teach you what this game is about. You have to understand that winning consistantly is difficult. Bad things can happen on every turn. You will only understand the unforgiving nature of this game by playing against real life people. The dice don't care about you. Rolling back to back failures happen just as astounding lucky plays do. The game is played by assuming you will fail the next roll.\n\nRage quitting isn't smart this time around. Be warned you will not gain star points for disconnecting, and your opponents will love you for it, because they will receive free points. Take your beatings when they are handed to you, and try again. At some point, your opponent will suffer from having horrible luck.\n\nI suppose its worth mention the UI isn't the greatest. The previous versions has the same problem. No loss there, either.\n\nVerdict? If you want to experience Blood Bowl like it should be, get this version. Keep in mind the original game was a board game that required another person, obviously. Wishing for a deep single player campaign is irrelevant. Playing Chess or Checkers against an AI is just as pointless. You learn more playing against actual people.\n\nIf you are weak, and would have your self esteem injured because you can't win every game you play, Don't play this game. If you can handle a few good beat downs, I'll see you on the pitch.","May 18","true","60.9"," 14 of 28 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","14","28","3","0"

It is really shocking how incompetent Cyanide/Focus are at adapting a board game.  Some of their balance changes like increasing the Orc Blitzer cost to 90k are also ridiculous and completely unnecessary.\n\nEssentially this game is a vastly inferior product to Blood Bowl; Chaos Edition the previous version of the game which has 23 races and more features.  How Cyanide released BB2 with so many critical features of the game completely missing is incredible.\n\nCheck back in 6-9 months when more teams are available and see if they've added a lot of the features they should have had in game on release day.  The game will probably be on a 75% off sale by then and might be worth buying at that point.\n\nEdited Oct 7:  Cyanide/Focus just held an AMA on Reddit and unfortunately they validated the worst fears of those who were skeptical of Cyanide/Focus.  Most of the missing features are not coming due to cost restraints or in some cases conscious design decisions and the same is true for many of the broken features.  It's absurd but they claim it's too costly to do the art work to have player appearances change as they level up but they are fine with charging over 5 euros for the DLC on each new race.  The wood elf and lizardman stars have their heads cut and pasted onto the bodies of generic players of their respective races.  It's beyond belief.\n\nEdited 4/17/2016: Tomorrow will be 4 months after that Dec 18th announcement about the next four races and none of them are released yet and Cyanide has gone back into their shell of non-communication. Amazingly, the 5 minutes of work it'd take to correct the Orc roster still hasn't been done even though the game released over 6 months ago.\n\nI've about given up hope and that's sad because I love what this game could be if they'd just communicate and put some work in. This game deserves better than Cyanide/Focus as its developer.","September 22, 2015","false","38.9"," 39 of 79 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","39","79","0","1"

Graphics look amazing and a massive leap forward over the old version which was so ugly it was basically unplayable. A lot of time and money has gone in to the look. The engine is slick and performs OK. No CTD's or bugs for me as of yet. The gameplay is where its at though - its massively addictive. Player/team progression rocks and is faithful to the board game with a few tweaks here and there to the rules.\n\nTwo things really stand out for me from these reviews. 1. Please take all the haters with a pinch of salt. They aren't wrong, this is bare bones compared to the previous version(s), but its functional, looks good and plays great. All the extra stuff bitter vets want that isn't included isn't something you are going to miss as a newcomer. 2. Don't be misled in to beleiving you will get satisfying multiplayer on public servers. You may, chances are though you won't.\n\nAs for the game itself - its amazing. It really is. I never played the board game and I regret it now. The rules are simple (even if the strategy surrounding a play is anything but!) and you can pick them up easily enough. There's a wealth of online resources to plumb. Every single game is fresh and suitably random at times to keep your riveted. I've beated guys with 3 players left standing. I've beaten teams much higher rated due to a stroke of luck with the dice etc.\n\nLikewise you need to be prepared to get owned. Especially by bashy teams and agility teams. You need XP to get skills on your players to make them effective against elves and stuff. Don't judge the game by the first few matches you play.\n\nOverall, this is a well balanced, stable, beautiful update to the classic boardgame of yore. Sure there's niggles with customization, ui, online play etc. There are things we wish were included at release. Its also overpriced. All things you can live with and/or shop around to get a better deal etc.\n\n","October 13, 2015","true","18.5"," 22 of 45 people (49%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","49","22","45","0","0"

Instead, the player with the most strategy will always come out the victor. You will have to choose your moves carefully as one failed maneuver (which is determined by a roll of dice) will end the turn.\n\nEvery play made in Blood Bowl 2 will have a success rate attached to it like a roll of the dice. From simple maneuvers such as picking up the ball, to dodging tackles. Each position's stats will play a factor in this, so you don’t want to pass the ball to your linemen. Making smart decisions first, and saving riskier ones for later in your turn will allow players to do the most in one sitting.\n\nThe core gameplay is very complex, and you’ll have to learn the strengths of every class that’s in the game. So if you run straight into an online match you’ll be extremely confused. Thankfully, Blood Bowl 2 has an excellent campaign mode that serves as a tutorial. By introducing gameplay mechanics slowly, and adding to them in each subsequent game, Blood Bowl 2 manages to teach new players how to play a very complex game.\n\nBlood Bowl 2 also features some hilarious commentary. Unlike most sports games that try their hardest to sound professional, Blood Bowl 2 matches are announced by an odd pairing of a vampire and an Orc that’s a former player. Both will crack witty jokes constantly during games. The commentary ends up doing a great job of keep up the humor even at the most tense of times.\n\nAll in all this is a great game if youre into turn based/strategy games.","October 20, 2015","true","3.7"," 19 of 39 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","19","39","0","1"

I find many of the games tense like a good horror flick getting my adrenaline pumping, but football. It can be a frustrating game to learn as mistakes can be consequential and the dice can be very cruel. But the next turn everything can change. I've played Blood Bowl 1 a bit and also some previous versions. This one looks nicer obviously and I find using my Xbox360 controller and keyboard more convenient than keyboard mouse was.

Having people die is one thing, but only having a limited number of games in each player like I've read seems like it will annoy me greatly. But we will see when I get there. Maybe I wont care. Depending on the team you choose there can be a large hump you may have to get over before your teams can win with any regularity and not have your players die. Dying all the time and losing can be frustrating so consider that when you choose who to play and how you want to play.

Blood Bowl 2 has made some serious improvements. The game has great and extremely hard hitting animations. Mixed with the sound design when a character moves down the feild you can hear their weight stomping down the field. When you hit a player down to the floor the new take down animations are just brutal. Every dice roll has you sitting forward in your seat praying to nuffle you will get the result you neeed. If a roll goes against you you pray again hoping that your player will at least still be breathing when he hits the floor. As players earn points and become better you grow increasingly attached to them but the threat of death in Blood Bowl could take them scream away at anytime.

We both own a copy and I was really looking forward to playing Blood Bowl with him and showing him this game. I used to play the actual board game for years back in the day and loved it. I was so excited to see this game at first.\n\nHowever, it soon became apparent that the random dice generator was not so random at all, worse, it actually was baised towards the team with a lower team value for example, or if we set up a best of three competition and I had won the first round and he needed to win the second match or lose. I did alot of reading to see if others experienced this issue. Many have with rergards to playing the A.I and some within multiplayer, however they came under fire alot from fan boys. However the problem does exist within multiplayer. It's just harder to see if you play loads of different players. It's got to a point now were me and my friend can't enjoy this game between the two of us.\n\nIt's mainly based around TV (team value). Once I start to climb above my friend, the dice rolls start to become ever more biased towards the lesser team. Worse, deaths and injuries bringing his team closer to my level. We have started over a new many a time with new teams and the game becomes fair as in equal bad luck good luck and it's great fun. It's only once I being a more experenced player, start to get a better side we start seeing really silly fake dice results.\n\nIt's like the games trying to keep it even and will ruin your side at times sending many of your team into your K'O and injury box just to level the playing field. Even though I'm a chaos side and he plays elves and is leaving himself open to block attacks with skills like mighty blow. Your try and go for it needing a roll of 2+ on a D6 and fail at crucial times even with re-rolls while the underdog pulls off multiple go for it's and crazy 33-50% odds with ease. That is until they level out around your team value or they push it to the stupid level within a turn beyond the crucial aspect of getting a touchdown.\n\nYour be shoving the underdogs players around with puch dice while they crack out blitz after blitz, unless it's a non critical target that has no real bearing on the attempted touchdown, it's very disheartening for both of us. And when we do start again with new teams, it's laughable how different the rolls are! Suddenly my team start hurting his side, and he starts failing rolls like I do when I'm ahead of his team value by a fair bit. I don't have to eat through re-rolls to pull off 2+ roll on a apparent D6 dice, don't get sent off everytime I attempt a foul and can use the block dice without multiple skulls showing up.\n\nOften I'll still win even with the heavely biased rolls against me, and still gain more SPP (skill points), which adds to my team value, which in turn makes the game perform ever more lame fake rolls. Stuff like death results followed by death results on key players even after re-rolls on the damage table. The underdog picking up the ball within multiple tackle zones at 33% then racing off to pass the ball with success across the pitch. While I can't even pick up the ball on a 67% chance and with re-rolls to boot. That is until both teams are more balanced with regards to me gaming with my friend.\n\nWith years of playing the board game, using real dice, you just don't see this, and it's a real shame because it truly ruins the experience for both players. My friend gets touch downs and it's like he donsen't feel like he even tried or deserved it, the game threw it at him to win. Then when we start a new, he gets totally owned until I start to take a team value lead, or it's a match which if I win, I win the small competition we set up.\n\nI also play online aganist the public, it's much less obvious there, it's really only when just playing my friend and seeing our teams grow apart team value wise you really see it, but it does de-value your overal outlook, I mean luck is one thing, but fixed matches is another beast entirly. Often, players just quit when facing apparent bad luck. But it just shows that the dice rolls are toatally fixed, nothing at all like acutal dice.\n\nThis really is not just a rant about having some bad luck.

Blood Bowl itself is a table top game with really good gameplay mechanics, and Cyanide can't do much in regards of changing it. One of the common review response is that Blood Bowl 2 does not offer same feature-set as Blood Bowl 1. However, I would argue that it offers one really important thing - it's super user friendly for newcomers:\n\n- UI is better\n- Chance of success percentage is really helpful\n- Animation is superior (You can't dismiss fun of anticipation of injuring other players).\n- Tutorial is good\n\nI'm not really experienced player, but Blood Bowl 2 helped me to understand the game rules better and it's really fun to watch. I even went back to Blood Bowl 1, and started to enjoy it even more. I found great player communities that organize regular competitions. Overall, it is really great experience that I have missed in computer games.\n\nMany BB1 veterans downvotes the game. But I would like to ask you to be patient, because BB2 actually helps our community to grow. I believe that Cyanide wanted to implement all the fancy features, but couldn't. They focused on making the game more approachable, and I praise them for it. And later more features will come.\n\nIn conclusion, if you're a fan of turn-based game, sport games, tabletop games and fantasy, you will have great time with this game. Don't make poor reviews to scare you. The top poor reviewers spend more than 100 hours, and it says about something to me. Go watch some let's plays. Watch Crendorian Invitational.

Certainly, but the only major complaint I have is the lack of a couches lobby and even then it would simply be very nice to have. A sticking point might be that there are only 8 (9 with the pre-order bonus, however they are not yet released) in the base game, but it is a good selection with more coming via DLC which will allow coaches to pick which teams they want to play as without the rebuying fiasco of the previous edition. (Note- you can play *against* any team that your opponents have, you do not need the DLC teams to participate in leagues for example)\n\nOne thing I really should note.  While BB2 does include a single player campain and the capacity to play single player vs the computer, this is not the focus of the game and it shows. While the AI is stronger then it was in BB1, it still has a hard time picking stratagies based on what turn it is.

If not, I'd imagine it's pretty close!)\n\nDo you have a gambling problem? This is the game for you. If you want a game that you will always win, keep moving. If, however, you want a punishing title that will sometimes make you scream for bad dice rolls, you found it. I think that's the charm of Blood Bowl 2. You could be royally screwed over on a dice roll that there was no reason to lose, yet so could your opponent. This game sometimes makes losing both fun and hilarious!\n\nBlood Bowl 2 is a mashup between the Games Workshop high fantasy universe and American football. It is turn based and your turn continues until you are finished moving players or you make a mistake and one of your players goes down or misses a catch (a turnover.)\n\nEach of your players has stats that determine movement range, number of dice rolled when blocking, catching, etc. The system is perfectly balanced and easy to understand. I find it very simple to estimate odds on the fly.\n\nWant a football game where players can be injured or killed? You're looking at it! I once played a game where my opponent only had three or four players left (total is always 11 with reserves.) Best part about the injuries (or worst, depending on perspective) is that they can stick with your players permanently. Death is also permanent. It's not all bad, though, as your players level up and can pick new skills or stats. My favorite part of the game and absolutely crucial in multiplayer.\n\nSpeaking of multiplayer, there are official and user-created leagues and I haven't once found myself unable to locate an opponent. Multiplayer makes this game one of my favorites and I highly recommend it, even to people not into sports.\n\nSingle player campaign seems fun, though I was bored of playing humans so I haven't completed it. It does appear to be short, perhaps meant as a way for new players to quickly learn the game.\n\nI give this game a 9/10. I can't wait to see some new races added to the mix. I'm also looking forward to the opening of the trading markets, where you can put players on the market and I think purchase others. Great fun! I would like to also see more lines from the hilarious commentators. (Bonus points to the devs for the Doctor Who and Game of Thrones reference.

Maybe that makes it "more casual," but it's definitely more helpful. The grid on the field was removed until you move units, which makes the field look nicer, but it makes it a little harder to calculate movements (I don't really care/notice). The only thing that I don't like is that many races are missing and will most likely be DLC. I still recommend this game over the first BB simply for the improved graphics, UI and the percent chances.","November 26, 2015","true","16.4"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

Turn-based footbal with fantasy races as players for your team. Bashy Orcs. Agile Elves. Murder-filled Chaos abominations. Only a sample of the 7 playable races with the base game with currently two DLC races that for now were only available via pre-ordering the game. All races have their own style of playing the field and the ball. Do you want to bash and smash your way to victory? Murder the enemy team? Or just run circles around them? There's a race with your playstyle.\n\nThe game has probably hands down the best tutorial for easing new players into the core game mechanics via the single player campaign. The UI has also seen an improved overhaul from the first game making it easier to understand the math behind the dice rolling the game does to determine failures and success. It also offers both solo and multiplayer play with custom teams with a leveling system to customize them to how you see fit. Join a league and smash your way to the top.\n\nBlood bowl does have a steep learning curve. Sure the tutorial is great at introducing all the things you need to know on how to play but learning the rest will come from practice and losing. You will lose games, players, have injuries but it's all a part of the process and makes for interesting conditions for playing each match. So read up on forums and the such for basic tactics used in the game or for team builds.\n\nRNG is a big factor in the game so if you hate it, this game isn't for you.\n\nA con of the current game is having DLC already when the races should have been included into the base game, not having even half the race roster the first had.","September 28, 2015","true","66.3"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

When you have 16 players, half of which have levels granting new abilities, then this uncertainty gets real tiresome.

In fact, I can only think of three that you could ever want, and even then two of them you would only want as an elf team and the other as an orc or maybe dwarf team.\n\nThe singleplayer experience is also lacking compared to Blood Bowl 1.  I liked how in Blood Bowl 1 you had the league system and there was a visual representation of progression for your team in terms of which league you were allowed to join.  Blood Bowl 2 also has a league system for single player, but its just a single league that seems to *sort of* scale with your team.  Plus there are no difficulty settings (at least that I could find).\n\nOh, and there is a game breaking single player bug where the other team just passes its turn without doing anything that is quite frequent.\n\nAnd on the topic of bugs, the game is quite buggy.  Other than the afformentioned game ruining single player bug, a lot of them are just minor interface or visual bugs that self correct.  But its just annoying to have to deal with them in a $45 game.\n\nThe game also feels like it was designed for a controller and the mouse/keyboard controls are fairly hamfisted.  Navigating the menus is more difficult than it should be, and I have a lot of instances of my players moving to the wrong square.  I'm not chalking that last one up to bugs though as, again, I just think its that the mouse/keyboard controls are bad and imprecise.\n\nI think that maybe in a few years, once the bugs are fixed, the interface is cleaned up, and more races are added the game is probably worth buying during a steam sale.  But right now, unless you're a hardcore blood bowl fan, I would pass.","October 18, 2015","false","11.3"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

I have read a lot of reviews here and this is my view about the game.\n\nPro's\n\n- Better graphics (personally i do not care too much about graphics, however having improved graphics and annimations helps)\n- The commentating has been improved.\n- More league types in solo mode (custom league is an improvement).\n\nNegatives\n\n- The game is not cheap and considering that it is likely going to have several DLC attached, we will probably end up paying a good 100-150$ in the end.\n- In regards to the fewer races (which is a big debating point), some people are forgetting that the previous versions also came with fewer races. I would say that this is not a problem, the problem is that they will probably charge us a hefty fee for each one. The game is not cheap as it is, so this will make this game extremely expensive.\n- Blitz mode is out! You used to be able to play the game in real time, which is not the main format to the game, but for people which prefered real time, they now have lost the type of game they liked most.\n- Overall this game has very little innovation added to it. Basically it is the same game as before, just it looks better and has fewer races. Online mode is improved, but overall it is the same game.\n- There is no save option during the games. Considering they take a while to complete, i have no idea why that option is not out there. It used to be there.\n- The gameplay is very slow. I would love an option where i could quicksim the opposition moves in solo mode. Staring at the screen for 2-3 minutes till the computer plays pretty much sucks, you can remove the annimations, which helps, but still, way too much waiting around.\n\nWhat i would have liked to see\n\n- A LOT more stats. The history section is very limited. There should be a lot more added to beef that section up.\n- Not much in terms of customization. I mean why is there no editor? Maybe i want to make a custom team or customize my players or opponents. I know that is not part of the original game, but i do not see why the developers did not add that option out there. I mean, i cannot even custom pick my own opponents in the solo leagues. I have to random pick which type of teams will be included in my leagues.\n- Why is there no hotseat co-op mode! I mean that would be an awesome option considering how few games use co-op these days on the PC.\n\nOverall?\n\nIf you have never played this game, you will love it if you like turn based sports games. There is not much which compares to this on the market. To a new player, this looks like a more polished and improved version, with the better graphics, annimations, commentary and online mode.\n\nTo a true fan of the series though, losing Blitz mode, losing 75% of the races in exchange for the better graphics (which get repetitive very early in a game like this), could be a serious drawback. I gave the game a recommended, mainly because this is an awesome game, just i feel that considering they had 6 years to make a new version, they could have added more to it, instead of removing what used to be there and charging us for everything.","September 25, 2015","true","29.2"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

Allowing for custom rulesets/rosters would be amazing.\n\n- Graphic settings don't save. So any change requiring a restart never actually happens. If the game isn't going to look much better than BB:CE, what's the point of this stripped-down version?\n\n- In-Game chat doesn't work. Might be a Mac issue? My opponents can chat, but hitting Enter or clicking on the chat icon only brings up the chat box. I can't get anything I type to appear.\n\n- Full price game + DLC teams isn't doing a niche game any favors. It would be a lot easier to get people interested in trying this game if the cost of entry for even just the initial rosters wasn't so high.\n\nPros:\n- Pretty.\n- Haven't had any crash/DC issues (way to go!!!!!)\n- Option to display Skill Icons over players is a good solution to one of my biggest complaints about BB:CE. Would be nice if they weren't opaque or if there was an option to choose which skills would appear.\n\n\n","May 20","false","78.1"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Now i'm in no way a hardcore blood bowl fan, in fact i had a hard time even remembering the rules. But blood bowl 2 turned out to be just the thing i needed, its easy to get into, the graphics makes it very enjoyable to wacth while you are learning and getting your ♥♥♥ kicked, and if you do need a hand picking up the finer details there is alot of help out there on youtube and forums, Sheepdog's youtube is a great place to start\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRu57V-oKAkQs4fx76dzIkw\n\nNow i think to enjoy blood bowl in the right way you have to do more than just play it, you have to talk to people. Make friends, laugh at you own stupid elf team failing to pick up the ball 7 times in a row, get invited to fun little leagues where you have to agree with you opponent when to play. Don't be afraide to just start out in multiplayer and ask for help, even if most players will see you as an easy win most of them will help you and often tell you what you could do better.\n\nNow there are some bad things about the game and some things that sounds worse then they are.\n\nThe bad:\n-There are some bugs! most of them are not game breaking but they are annoying as ♥♥♥♥, alot of them are not that obvious until you start trying fancy tactics and they consists mostly of the player not being able to choose when to use certain skills. ( note that this may be intentional and therefor will not be fixed)\n\n-Cyanide studios are terrible at communicating\n\n-There are only 10 teams are of right now, but more will come as dlc (tho we have no idear when due to the above)\n\n-Hardcore players have ALOT of other issues with the game, because bloodbowl one had alot more to offer in terms of teams and customization and because they hate the rules Cyanide changed in this version of the game. Now i understand them, its annoying when some one makes a 2.0 version of something but it feels like a 0.5 version, but as a new player with nothing to expect i love this game!\n\nNow a few things that sounds worse then they are:\n\nChaos is not OP, if you are tired of high team value kill teams, make sure to keep you TV low and laugh at them. If you want to play at high TV make a team who's main job is to foul the ♥♥♥♥ out of chaos teams (armor dosen't matter when 6 dwarfs jump on a guy lying down.\n\nYou players die and your teams fail. Accept it, laugh at it, its called bloody Blood Bowl.\n\nWhen with stupidly bad odds against a team with 1000 more TV than you don't give up, used the stupid petty cash, steal his rerolls, buy star players who you don't have to care if lives or dies, and last but not least belive in Nuffle. You agility 1 saurus can surely dodge twice pick up the ball and sprint for the touchdown line, its unlikely that it will work, but when it does you will be laughing you ♥♥♥ off, and hopefully so will your opponent.\n","November 5, 2015","true","237.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Varanae/recommended/236690/","Varanae","Varanae","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Varanae/","126 products in account","One of the most notable things about Blood Bowl 2 is the improved UI. The game will now display the % chance of a move, such as dodge or ball pickup succeeding while is a massive bonus for new players. Speaking of new players the Campaign is essentially a long tutorial, which is absolutely necessary in a game like Blood Bowl. The last game suffered as it wasn’t really accessible, whereas you can learn how to play much more easily in this one.\n\nIn addition to UI improvements the graphics are significantly better. The animations, particularly when blocking an opposing player, are lovely to look at. Each race also gets their own separate set of animations which really shows how much time has been spent developing each race. Everything you do has proper weight behind it and really immerses you in the experience. When a Saurus is blitzing down your lowly Peasant you’ll feel the fear.\n\nThe online leagues are easy to enter and it’s fun as hell creating a team with a silly name and theme. From my experience the community has been friendly and welcoming. It’s always nice when 2 players can both laugh at the dice rolls and unlikely moves that somehow pay off. Hopefully the community stays civil, it’s a nice change of pace from other competitive games.\n\nThe obvious downside is the lack of teams compared to the Chaos Edition of Blood Bowl 1. That’s pretty much the reason the reviews currently show as “mixed” on Steam. Personally I can see how much effort goes into every team in Blood Bowl 2, so I understand the smaller selection. More teams will come, but I imagine they will cost extra. This might put some people off, at least until a sale.\n\nOverall Blood Bowl 2 is a massive improvement from Blood Bowl: Chaos Edition. It’s prettier, cleaner and all round more user friendly. Everything from menus to stadiums to the Skinks beady little eyes are improved. I would certainly recommend this game, especially for people new to Blood Bowl.\n","September 24, 2015","true","58.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Shiney.\n\nSo, i'm speaking purely from the perspective of a casual player of the first game. I have no interest in playing in online leagues except with freinds, and i'm not looking for super hard AI like a machocist. Call me a scrub or whatever, thats fine, but with that in mind I can't recomend this game.\n\nI'll start with what I like/love. The UI is soooo much better, I don't have to look through the rulebook anymore to determine whether or not I can make a dodge, the game will actualy give me PERCENTAGES on actions like that. A little thing, you might think, but it's a huge improvement on the first. The graphics are lovely, as are the brutal animations, that i've yet to get tired of watching.\n\nCampaign basicaly serves as the new tutorial mode from what I can tell (Have yet to play it all), and it seems legit. The first game had a 'tutorial', where the first part of the rulebook for the board game was read out and it asked you to do a few basic things before dropping you in and letting you figure out the rest. This seems like more of a lengthly, in-depth afair with some neat narrative and story built in, so thats nice.\n\nCan't really talk about online, as I said at the start. But the solo leagues give you plently of options. Make a team and take them through elimination style cups or round robin modes, and your team will remain consistant with injuries, perma-deaths, level ups and even retirements of players when they get too old (Though very few blood-bowl players make it that far).\n\nAnnnnd now my biggest problem with the game: The AI. Outside of freindly matches (Pick teams, have one match with no consequences afterwards) YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO PICK THE DIFFICULTY OF THE AI. Solo leagues all seem to feature random AI difficulties. I've heard somewhere that they scale, but for me it's seemed totaly random.\n\nAs I said before, I am a casual player. I can face easy/meduim difficulty AI and still have a challangingly fun time. But with this system on AI in solo leagues, no matter what, I am guarenteed to hit a brick wall of difficulty. I could play through 2 rounds of a 3 round elimination tournament and have a nice level of AI, but the third match will suddenly be a ♥♥♥♥-show where the AI has suddenly shifted to either hard or brutal difficulty.\n\nIt's all good having a scaling system, but it seems to alienate players from both worlds. People looking for difficulty will steamroll through boring games regularaly, whereas casual, new players will always encounter matches that will frustrate and put them off the game. It would be much better for both sides if you could set the AI to whatever you want, or have something of a fighting game system, where it scales in a concentrated way, say from easy at the start to meduim at the end, or from meduim at the start then hard at the end.\n\n\n*deep breath*\n\nThat aside, I don't have any other problems with the game. I'm not even bothered about the lack of teams compared to the first game (The first game had 23 teams as of Blood Bowl: Chaos Edition, whereas Blood Bowl 2 has 8, with lots of DLC coming). It has all the races I want to play (Orcs and Skaven) so I don't care. But unfortunately thanks to that issue the enjoyment I get out of the game is far outweighed by the frustration and salt.\n\n\nTL;DR version (I don't blame you): Blood Bowl 2 is great, but because of the way the AI is scaled/random in solo leagues (The only mode i'm interested in playing), I can't recommend it to people looking to play casually. Unless they patch it so that you can set the difficulty, I won't be continuing to play except with the occasional friend perhaps. Shame.","September 27, 2015","false","19.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

A lot of people complain about this but since the 8 races seems to really play differently, it is already enough, and for the DLC, I hate them as anybody, but since the game is "only" 45 euro, it don't bother me as much.\nSo if you're looking for a cool turn based strategy based with a sport coating, this one could be it !","October 6, 2015","true","19.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Now i'm in no way a hardcore blood bowl fan, in fact i had a hard time even remembering the rules. But blood bowl 2 turned out to be just the thing i needed, its easy to get into, the graphics makes it very enjoyable to wacth while you are learning and getting your ♥♥♥ kicked, and if you do need a hand picking up the finer details there is alot of help out there on youtube and forums, Sheepdog's youtube is a great place to start\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRu57V-oKAkQs4fx76dzIkw\n\nNow i think to enjoy blood bowl in the right way you have to do more than just play it, you have to talk to people. Make friends, laugh at you own stupid elf team failing to pick up the ball 7 times in a row, get invited to fun little leagues where you have to agree with you opponent when to play. Don't be afraide to just start out in multiplayer and ask for help, even if most players will see you as an easy win most of them will help you and often tell you what you could do better.\n\nNow there are some bad things about the game and some things that sounds worse then they are.\n\nThe bad:\n-There are some bugs! most of them are not game breaking but they are annoying as ♥♥♥♥, alot of them are not that obvious until you start trying fancy tactics and they consists mostly of the player not being able to choose when to use certain skills. ( note that this may be intentional and therefor will not be fixed)\n\n-Cyanide studios are terrible at communicating\n\n-There are only 10 teams are of right now, but more will come as dlc (tho we have no idear when due to the above)\n\n-Hardcore players have ALOT of other issues with the game, because bloodbowl one had alot more to offer in terms of teams and customization and because they hate the rules Cyanide changed in this version of the game. Now i understand them, its annoying when some one makes a 2.0 version of something but it feels like a 0.5 version, but as a new player with nothing to expect i love this game!\n\nNow a few things that sounds worse then they are:\n\nChaos is not OP, if you are tired of high team value kill teams, make sure to keep you TV low and laugh at them. If you want to play at high TV make a team who's main job is to foul the ♥♥♥♥ out of chaos teams (armor dosen't matter when 6 dwarfs jump on a guy lying down.\n\nYou players die and your teams fail. Accept it, laugh at it, its called bloody Blood Bowl.\n\nWhen with stupidly bad odds against a team with 1000 more TV than you don't give up, used the stupid petty cash, steal his rerolls, buy star players who you don't have to care if lives or dies, and last but not least belive in Nuffle. You agility 1 saurus can surely dodge twice pick up the ball and sprint for the touchdown line, its unlikely that it will work, but when it does you will be laughing you ♥♥♥ off, and hopefully so will your opponent.\n","November 5, 2015","true","237.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Would definitly reccomend to new comers in the series.

PVP matches are based solely on team value rather than player skill, so having a basic team get pounded time after time by a levelled team means that getting any of the players levelled up without injury after injury or even death, becomes a pointless grind.

The character animations are excellent and Jim and Bob the commentators are hillarious! A great addition to this sort of game.\n\nWould I recommend this? If you're familiar with Blood Bowl (either the board game or the first Blood Bowl PC game) then yes, having pre-existing knowledge of how each type of player works and how each type of team plays will be essential and will allow you crucial early victories, enabling your players to develop their skills.\n\nIf you've never played Blood Bowl before or are unfamiliar with this type of game then I can only suggest getting a hammer and breaking your own fingers with it, you'll have much more enjoyment than you would playing this game.","October 16, 2015","false","14.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","43","3","7","3","0"

Same rules, same gameplay, all the fun with less work.\n\nThe interface is mostly intuitive, though with an occasional misclick can be a frustrating way to lose a point. Helpful hints like coloring to indicate tackle zones, and popup bubbles to explain your chance of success on various actions tend to make up for it, though, and I imagine misclicks will happen less often as the interface becomes second nature.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that the rules documentation is woefully incomplete, with some elements like interceptions almost entirely missing from the supposedly detailed rules document available online. Hopefully, this will be completed at some point, but in the meantime, it's possible to find the boardgame's tournament rules online, and the computer game appears to mirror them faithfully.\n\nOverall, definitely worth picking up.","October 22, 2015","true","14.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The main thing I loved from the first Bloodbowl (which I was a sucker for, buying all DLC etc) was the way your team grew and improved itself over time. This now takes so long that it is hardly a factor. I now find myself too bored between turns to properly focus, leading to a lack of tacticality and so lose more matches, meaning Im less into it, leading the whole experience into a death spiral which inevitably leads me to reach for a different game.\n\nOverall, slow, not much new, just a moneymaking re-hash from a studio that has lost the original meaning of the bloodbowl...a shame.","October 1, 2015","false","111.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It's brutal, cunning, and brings out the inner nerd in us all watching an Elf leap over a Dwarf's head to score a touchdown. Like to pass and run? Then the Elves and Humans are for you. Prefer to sow the seeds of sorrow and despair? Chaos, Dwarves, and Lizardmen will leave your foe reeling in horror watching every one of his player suffer an injury or die.\n\nOf course features are lacking like player progression. My Chaos units would so much cooler with some extra spikes. Stat stracking is only based on team and not players, single player is average, and no where near the sheer number of teams available from BB:CE. Though all of this should be fixed in time.

For seasoned players of Blood Bowl, this is a step down from its predecessor Chaos verion in regards to options, choices, and chat.\n\n1 = same as Blood Bowl Chaos version.\n2 = Blood Bowl 2 only.\n\nPro's\n- 1 = Good graphics even for "low powered" computers.  (Still got to have something for Blood Bowl 2 though)\n- 1 = Challenging pvp even if you are a pro at the game.\n- 1 = Players of your team can level up and progress (really rewarding if playing low armored teams!).\n- 1 = Can watch other people's games.  Spectator mode!\n- 1 = League play.\n- 1 = Team Build options!\n- 2 = Added feature of stadium building and upgrading.\n\nCons\n- 2 = no out of ingame chat room.  hard to find leagues without it making matchmaking your main tool unless you are already in a group, using the forums, or are introduced to one while in game.\n- 2 = choices are limited or null when abilities come into play.  Sometimes you would rather have something happen specifically than using your player's abilities...\n- 2 = less teams available then its predessesors.\n- 1 = still has certain glitches or errors that "need" to be resolved.\n- 2 = team players don't get upgraded visually when they level up.  Chaos version has this, but Blood Bowl 2 does NOT!  Grapevine has mentioned that it isn't on the dev "to do" list either....\n- 2 = Navigation seems weird.  Chaos version was easier and has/had far more options.\n- 2 = Nothing visual gets upgraded.  Not the stadiums, players, or anything.  Once you play one game in each stadium as well as against each race of team, you pretty much seen everything it has to offer.\n\nAs a Blood Bowl Chaos game player, I expected more out of BB2 (Blood Bowl 2).  Instead, it feels and has given less overall.  With options taken away that players come to love, I expect many players to sound off against this newer version.  Basically, it seems they were in a hurry and skipped a few things to get the game out.  I understand having less teams as they will probably release more teams as DLC packs later on (their money making venture).  I expected that part.\n\nIf I was a first time player, I probably wouldn't like the game too much.  I am generally not a fan favorite of matchmaking.  Always hated waiting for a game/match in any game.  This is a new game/version, so there isn't much of a wait yet.  I generally don't go to forums either unless I can't play the game or found glitches or problems in the game.  The game can be extremely redundant if playing against cpu (for both versions story or no story).  The pvp aspect is an absolute in this game as that adds the flavor of challenge and frustration together making it way less redundant.\n\nThe biggest error on this version's release is the chat thing.  There is no game chat unless you are in a match.  Even then, you are limited to speaking to only one person as spectators cannot communicate with players inside the match.  This limits or makes it more difficult for new players to fully appreciate the value and gained friendships playing the game.\n\nI still recommend the game though on the basis of already having "gained friendships" and leagues that were already ongoing before its release.  If not for those, I would have to say no for a recommendation for almost every aspect of the game.  Even if it were available for 5$ US, I would still not recommend it to new players that do not have leagues or friends already involved unless they are willing to deal with limited ingame chat, googling for leagues, or going to the game's forums.","November 3, 2015","true","100.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Same rules, same gameplay, all the fun with less work.\n\nThe interface is mostly intuitive, though with an occasional misclick can be a frustrating way to lose a point. Helpful hints like coloring to indicate tackle zones, and popup bubbles to explain your chance of success on various actions tend to make up for it, though, and I imagine misclicks will happen less often as the interface becomes second nature.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that the rules documentation is woefully incomplete, with some elements like interceptions almost entirely missing from the supposedly detailed rules document available online. Hopefully, this will be completed at some point, but in the meantime, it's possible to find the boardgame's tournament rules online, and the computer game appears to mirror them faithfully.\n\nOverall, definitely worth picking up.","October 22, 2015","true","14.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Just watch it on youtube, no need to buy it because of that. After a couple of days this impression will diminish, and what will remain is below.\n\nCons:\n1) Almost zero singleplayer value. AI still is pretty bad, short campaign is nothing more than a tutorial. What left is a generic random matchmaking, without any elements that could add some variety (that were proposed by fans, btw, like add custom made weather/regional conditions and random events, that are not in the officail rules, it would be okay for single-player) That's not a big problem, for me at least, but this does not differ from the previous game (Chaos Edition), so no reason to pay for that.\n2) Changes to official rules being unconditionally enforced by Cyanide (aging, changes of players' costs, many skills are now being used without your consent thus limiting tactical options). Wouldn't have been a problem if that was optional changes and you could create a custom league where official rules are in place, but in its current implementation it's untolerable.\n3) Unintuitive, inconvinient console-oriented UI. Some its design flaws are imported straight from the previous game, what means that Cyanide does not learn, and does not care about feedback from their players. No grid, no player names/classes on the field atm, quite irritating approach to visualization of team during setups (those long waits when they run from position to position). Horrible league management UI atm.\n\nUpdate:\nLast patch indeed introduced some major improvements to the game. !Some! skills at last became optional (not all that should be), and they made better design of the setup phase, no long waits anymore. Still, they haven't yet reached conformance with the official rules, neither they offered option to create a custom league with such rules.\n\nUpdated verdict: still refrain from buying it at least for now, or wait for a huge discount.

La IA sigue sin jugar bien, puede traerle problemas a un jugador nuevo, pero una vez que se haya aprendido lo basico ya no presenta desafio ninguno y se vuelve aburrida. Sabemos que es un juego muy complejo y por tanto programar la IA para que sea competitiva seria muy caro, por lo cual es recomendable migrar al juego multiplayer lo antes posible.\nlas herramientas para administrar ligas privadas son muy basicas y no permiten muchas de las funcionalidades que habia en versiones anteriores (como otorgar premios en las competiciones).\n\npero los parches que han ido sacando fuero ncorregiendo los bugs iniciales y el equipo de desarrolladores ha demostrado que escucha a la comunidad y sus reclamos.\n\nse ha anunciado una nueva Copa del Mundo con premios en efectivo para 2016, cuya fase clasificatoria comienza en enero y se disputa en distintas ligas a lo largo y ancho del mundo.\n\nen fin, yo recomiendo el juego tanto para quienes gustan de blood bowl como para quienes no lo conocen, vale la pena probarlo!","November 27, 2015","true","920.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

These has been solved with this beautifully rendered digital version. While is doesn't boast all the possible teams of the previous iterations, Blood Bowl 2's in-game interface displays a lot more info neatly and team management is vastly improved. They've also streamlined the game to guide you to multiplayer; simplifying the single player experience but I think this is for the better. You'll get the most out of multiplayer if you join one of the many communities around the game.\n\nUnfortunately, at time of writing, there are some annoying, sometimes game breaking bugs and missing features; and the developer hasn't been very vocal about plans to patch. They've also implemented microtransactions and the other teams should be coming as DLC; but so far the microtransactions seem to be cosmetic only. It must also be said that the tutorials are rather poor for the complete novice.\n\nI highly recommend this game but not to people who expect a perfect product or unwilling to take the time to learn the mechanics.","November 24, 2015","true","69.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

(The ONLY other aspect of BB2 which MIGHT be superior is the AI. All I know for certain is the AI in BBCE was poor/weak. My rating of AI in BBCE is 3.5/10. This leaves plenty of room for improvement, which is the only reason I assume the AI MIGHT be better.)\n\nFirst, The UI is extremely clunky, most players (who are familiar with BBCE) typically will develop their own personal "pet-peeves" & annoyances accompanied by certain changes.\n\nPersonally, my biggest annoyance with the UI is the skills & names representation on-field.  (The tiny squares both on-field & in the character stat/selection boxes etc etc...)\n\n\nI mean, what the hell is easier for people? Reading 1-2 words for each skill, or memorizing 30-40ish different TINY symbols which then correlate to a certain skill? I understand the logic and reasoning as to WHY they'd implement this change, but sometimes things which are GREAT in theory turn out to be AWFUL in practice..\nIf you turn on the option that shows the players skills on-field, the big guys have around 10 boxes floating above them. So, now you have some HUGE Treeman/minotaur, who's hard to see behind anyway, with 10 squares above  him.... You could hide a whole f@#$% team of goblins behind one Treeman...\n\nAlso, SOOOOO many less teams is a GIGANTIC downside for me. I cannot STAND mirror matches (matches against same races) so this was particularly infuriating. I think BBCE has around 28 teams, and BB2 has around 10.\n\nThen, to top it off Cyanide wants to tax you 15-25% of the games buying price if you want to buy an extra team. 7 Bucks extra for lizzys OR woodelfs. Not both...14 bucks for both...\n\nCyanide, do you want my work schedule? So you can come over and rob & pillage my family while you're holding me hostage??\n\nLast thing.....I've found no Mods either....#wastingdollarsmakesnocents","March 24","false","360.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

I don't know rugby rules much as well, but this game somehow caught me and I enjoy it a lot.\nSecondly, you might not be sure about purchasing this game because of many negative reviews/recommendations..\nI think it is mainly because when the game was launched, there were many bugs and people were often disconnected from their multiplayer games. There were also fewer playable races than in Blood Bowl (1), so some people could be mad about this. (there are still fewer races than in BB1, but more playable races will be added in future patches)\nHowever, BB2 today (2016) is much better than it was before. And also better than BB1. Mechanics are clear, turns allow you to manage your strategy properly and the UI is satisfying as well.\nThere is a campaign that new players will appreciate a lot since it serves as a tutorial and you will learn there a lot. Then you can practise against good BOTs or join one of many multiplayer leagues and improve you and your team with every game there.\n\nI highly recommend this game. If you like board games, you should consider buying it.

Yes, that means you will always be fighting an uphill battle even against the AI. The AI isn't that smart, but the developers made up for that by rigging their dice.\n- Brute force teams;  Dwarves, Lizardmen, Chaos, Orks, etc... are the only really playable teams. As long as you use the standard cage formation you will basically never lose the ball nor break through their cage. So much for creative strategy.  How to use: 1 cage per game, rinse and repeat as needed.\n- Elves and skaven are highly underpowered (This presents a problem if you are an Elf lover like myself). Maybe they don't have strength  but they can pass and run. However, what good is that when they can barely beat or avoid brute force lines and then run only half way (skaven; full way).\n- That all actions in the game are luck based (obviously as all actions are based on dice rolls) but certain basic actions you would assume a monkey could do are possible to fail (eg pick up a ball). I understand that this is a way the game progresses. However, when a guy fails to pick up a ball two turns in a row, it's not unfortunate, it's a form of mental disablity. (Note: not an actual issue, just something that ticks me off, and believe me you will be too)\n- The money system used to form teams is unfair to newer players. You are given just enough money to make a basic team and then plus a little extra to buy "staff".  However if you don't buy the better players to buy more staff you're at a disadvantage to almost all. If you buy better players and can't buy as much staff then you are a disadvantage to more experienced players (who usually have a lot).\n- Finally, minor side effect: The cutscenes that make you fall in love with the game in the ads will become redundant and tiresome fairly quickly (You can diable them, but its cutting out a great cinematic feature that you would like to watch but don't want to see repated five times a half). For more understanding of this watch and rewatch the trailer for an hour and that's just sums up one game.\n\nFinally, on a personal note I bought this game thinking it would be a fun strategy game I could play while relaxing after work/college. It's anything but relaxing, it is agravating as a any Call of Duty multiplayer. As I mentioned, it is luck based and when everything goes right, it feels great. But that's rare. Usually, you'll find yourself at the corner of Unlucky and Not Skilled Enough. When you are 5 steps from a touch down and that's when things go wrong, it's almost enough to just quit the game then and there. It's a fun game if you have patients for the BS you'll have to wade through to become good.

I'll try and make my review unbias, however I do enjoy the game so far, so that's going to show through.\n\nI've played around 3 matches now, and I can say I'm really impressed.\nFor anyone concerned that there may not be a way to do Single player tournaments, well let me put your mind at ease, as there is. You can build a team, and then choose to do a whole tournament vs AI instead of online.\nWith that out of the way, I was a much happier player! I spent most of my time in Blood Bowl 1 just building teams and doing tournaments, and here you can do the same thing.\n\nAlso, once you actually play it, you can see a lot of work has gone into it. Sure, there are only 8 teams + the pre-order teams, however there has been a lot of effort put into those teams, and we all know more will be released.\nThe game as it stands is very playable, and you can turn the commentators off. (the subtitles stay on, but they'll no doubt put in a fix for that)\n\nSo here's a quick layout for you to make up your own mind\nPros - The UI is modern and simple. It takes some getting used to but it's cleaner and I found it uncluttered and easy to use.\n-The graphics are better (of course) but they have really put a lot of love into this game\n-The block animations are great, I love them, if you don't you can turn them off... but I'll never get sick of my Dark Elves kicking over an opposition!\n-It's still Blood Bowl, the rules are the same, they have stayed true, they haven't tried to make a blitz mode which for me is a pro, instead they have put all their effort into making a working tournament system, that you can either play online or solo. It has a home stadium you can sink spare gold into, it has an coach experience system, it feels like there are a lot of other ways to spend your cash\n-The campaign is only Humans, I don't like humans, but the campaign in the last was only humans or orcs, and apparently they have put in a LOT of extras into it to make it an interesting story, so I'll try it, but I can't comment on it as I haven't yet. I think it's a pro that they didn't just leave it as tournament play, they actually put in some effort here!\n-The AI is smarter... definitely smarter... which makes it a lot more dangerous\n\nAverage-\n-The game takes a little longer, I am sure I could trim it by chopping back animations and gaining more experience on the UI, but the old Blood Bowl took around 20 mins a match, which was nice.\n-Since the tournament is online or solo, it saves your team after a match. This stops you from loading when you lose a player. I love and hate this feature, as it could break your team to lose your star player, but then... it's blood bowl... players die... So as long as you can come to terms with this, then you'll be fine. I'm still coming to terms with it, but it's not a con.\n-The team count. Who cares? Some obviously do. This in no way affected my decision to purchase this game. I have a lot of teams I enjoy playing, some are here, some aren't. It hasn't bothered me.\n\nCons\n-To be completely honest, I bought it knowing it was blood bowl, and it is. It's better than the last in a lot of ways, it's worse in few. I don't mind the crowd is all human. The crowd in the last game was barely rendered...\n-The cheerleaders are only human, this doesn't affect gameplay...  but I'll list it here, it's something they will add in.\n\nThat's about it. I just wanted to put in a review that assures people they can spend hours on the single player, just like the last game, and still have team progression. The price point is pretty good for a game I know I'll spend 100+ hours playing...\n\nFor those that aren't buying it due to the number of teams playable, well, that's a shame, but they will release more.\n\nI can't comment on the Multi-player or campaign as I haven't tried them yet","September 30, 2015","true","33.8"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

Blood Bowl (BB) is the game of Fantasy Football (with Elves, Dwarfs, Orcs etc.), akin to real-life Rugby (play only halts when a point is scored) or American Football, only with excessive violence, death, secret weapons and even magic. Oh, and the ball has spikes on it. BB 2 has a new and improved game engine with awesome brutal cinematics and a cleaner UI. As well as more multiplayer possibilities than BB 1 (player trading, stadium upgrades), there's a brand new narrative single player campaign that is simple enough to appeal to new players, but with just enough variety to engage long-time fans. Lots and lots of chaos and fun.\n\nBe aware: this game is based on dice-rolling, so luck plays a part. BUT there is also lots of strategy to it, from more basic ideas like risk management and positioning, to the more complex such as chain pushing and team builds/management/development (useful site - http://bbtactics.com/). 90% of the few hundred matches I've played (that's including previous versions of the game) have felt like the better player won. Sometimes bad luck really does strike yes, but if you analyse your game-play you usually could've made some better decisions, too. Don't be put off by what seems like bad luck in your first few games, but be warned that this game requires some patience to get good at.\n\nOnline leagues are where Blood Bowl 2 really comes to life. The AI seems hard at first, but can become too easy quite quickly. Online you get the challenge of real players, can choose options such turn length (I would highly recommend 1 or 2 minute turns) and even make your own league. Matchmaking and ladder climbing in the biggest leagues is fun, but there's nothing better than playing a tournament with your friends :D","October 25, 2015","true","32.5"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

Their graphic assets are a lot better than their first blood bowl game.\n\nUnfortunately, that is where the positivies stop.\n\nThe game feels broken. Not buggy but rather suffering from poor designed.\nThe random dice rolls do not feel random.\n\nThe graphic animations are on repeat  and get boring very quickly.\nThe camera keeps on zooming around the field making it hard to see what is happening.\nThe matching system is still a joke, although a bit better than in the previous game.\n\nSo overall, you once again have a set of great board game rules wrapped up in a second rate computer game.\n\nOn top of that this company has very poor community management.

A neckbeard's wet dream that features a fantasy universe that gets me excited as fresh Hotpockets and Mountain Dew coupled with a sport I pretend to like so my dad doesn't make fun of how much I rek noobs online.\nThe moment I stepped in I was greeted with a much sleeker, easier to navigate menu and ui. I went to create my team (The Royal Neckbeards) and found a decent level of customization. If you compare the customization to something like an rpg, an mmo, or really a "normal" sports game, then you come up disappointed. However, compared to the original Blood Bowl, I would have needed a mod or two to end up with the same level of character customization (armor color and face). Upon creating my human team, I looked at the other 7 races. This is important because, when reading reviews here, people seemed to complain about how Blood Bowl: Chaos Edition had 23 playable races so why are we down to 8. Well Blood Bowl originally launched with 8 races as well with Chaos Edition coming out roughly 3 years after vanilla launch. So yes, those extra 15 races were DLC.\n\nHopping into the game is where you run into the bulk of the problems (which isn't saying much). The UI is much more noob-friendly and it is easier to tell what's going on with dice rolls and such rather than having to look back at the dice logs. That being said I would like to see dice logs implemented along with the "always-on" grid from Blood Bowl; this is just something I was used to having back in BB1. Graphically speaking, the game is a huge improvement from BB1, however there are a few things I'd like to see changed graphically. I would like to see more diverse animations (play a game with any race and you'll see all their animations) when blocking. Also, race-specific cheer-leaders and fans. The cheerleaders are all humans for every race which makes little sense. Also when a player gets knocked off the pitch he's beat up by the fans which, again, are the same 3 generic humans. If I'm playing in a dwarf arena, I want to see dwarves beat the crap outta some guy! After my game I found that there were basic endgame stats (# of armor breaks, injuries, MVP) but I didn't find the same in depth stat tracking I loved from BB1.\n\nThe problems I've found are minor there were no major bugs, something a lot of games at release don't have. There are some people that are salty their favorite race isn't in yet (where's ma Chaos Dwarves!?) but just as with BB1 I'm sure they'll get released in decent sized DLC. At the end of the day, it's the same Blood Bowl I know and love and it's expanded its horizons to attract newer players to the series while still offering veterans their Blood Bowl fix. 9/10 would dwarf again.","September 24, 2015","true","95.7"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

But Chaos Edition had no Steamworks, horrible graphics and one of the worst UI's AND tutorials i've ever seen in a video game. So in a nutshell, if you're new to Blood Bowl, this is a great place to start. You'll certainly know how to play the game after you've played the campaign for 5-10 hours or so. After that you probably want to start looking at the online league gameplay and developing your own strategies using information online or by figuring it out yourself or with friends.\n\nAs for people who actually enjoyed playing Chaos Edition... Err, well, i guess that the game is better if you want the core Blood Bowl experience that's closest to the actual board game but don't care if it's not too great of a video game.","September 28, 2015","true","17.7"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

I have had basically 9 our of 10 (I have played around 20 so far) fantastically fun games with people from the US, Europe, New Zealand and South Korea.... only a couple of disatisfied wining dolts as in in multiplayer community have been unpleasant, but even that is handled well by Cyanide\n\n5) Connection and stability is MUCH better to BB1\n\n6) THIS game is an ultimate strategy game with heavy reliance on dice! But the dice require a strategy of their own since they have a massive impact... the beauty of Blood Bowl is that nothing is certain, not even that 100% sure touchdown, where you are almost there.\n\nIf you are an intelligent, patient, strategy game player who wants to be massively entertained do not hesitate to pay out for this not-overpriced release (the engine makes i worthwile in my opinion)","September 29, 2015","true","44.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The models and animations are superbly crafted, the indicators for tackle zones and movement allowances looks far more appealing than in Blood Bowl 1, and it's generally very clear to see what's happening on the pitch.\n\nThe game itself is a lot of fun.  There's a good amount of depth in strategy and tactics, and the variety in the available races makes every game feel different, yet still familiar.  The tutorial is a decent enough way to learn the basics of the game, and if you name your players then you have a real emotional connection to them, whether they're killing the opposing team's Big Guy or failing to pick up the ball for the third time in a row.  It makes the whole thing just that little bit more personal.\n\nBut it also has its problems.  When it comes to graphics choices, with the exception being able to turn off grass and/or spectators for fps gains, you are limited to a selection from 'low' to 'very high', with no explanation given to what these mean.  There's no way to know how detailed the shadows are, or how much antialiasing each setting uses.  For a modern PC game, this is sub-par at best.\n\nThis lack of meaningful options also extends into other areas of the game.  Veterans of Blood Bowl will want to be able to choose which skills they activate manually and which kick in automatically, but no such option exists.  Simplicity is very much at the core of Cyanide's design ethos for Blood Bowl 2, even at the expense of expected functionality.\n\nThe interface is very much designed for consoles, with lots of scrolling left to right instead of either up and down or using drop-down boxes.  This is most irritating when selecting saved formations.  You have to cycle through them one by one, and if you're too slow then you have to wait while your team reorganises itself on the pitch before you can select the next formation.  It's unnecessarily clunky and slow.\n\nSpeaking of being unnecessarily slow, repositioning individual players before the game kicks off now requires you to wait until they run into position before you can select the next player to move.  This makes setting up a formation player-by-player take far longer than it needs to.  The display for showing how many dice you will roll against an opponent also requires a short hover time now, instead of popping up immediately.  Again, it's not gamebreaking but it gets irritating.\n\nFinally, control of the camera is often taken away from you on your opponent's turn.  Cyanide have decided that your opponent's players will take centre stage, whether you want them to or not.  It doesn't matter whether you can already see them well enough, or if you would rather look at another area of the pitch to plan your next move.  No.  Bad you.  Little Scruffy moving 3 squares is far more important than that.  Look at him.  NOW!\n\nI'm also experiencing a lot of crashes, though I will note that I seem to be very much in the minority on that issue.  But even having followed the advice of uninstalling and reinstalling graphics card drivers, turning off all possible programs, and even reinstalling the game itself, I still get dumped out of the client on a regular basis.\n\nBut despite all this, I still have a lot of fun with the game.  I would definitely recommend it to people who want to get into Blood Bowl.  Veterans, however, may find that the differences between BB2 and BB1 are sufficient to play the older game, particularly with the reduced team roster (currently 10 teams available).","September 29, 2015","true","121.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

But the game itself is very poor (no team customisations, no racial cheerleaders, no skin upgrade per level (what ?? seriously in 2015 no skin upgrade on players, bunch of lazy devs !) solo is a joke, multi config non existant), and badly designed (console UI, TV is ok but in replay you can't go back or forward ... all seems so amateurish,there is no graphic options !!).\nThe game itself is not bad (animations are great), but lacks of polishing ( stadium are just jokes) and are far too long ... 1h30 - 2 h per match isn't correct. The ratio time given/ xp earned is too high.. graphics are ok but not amazing at all (again for a bloodbowl 2015 game, its far too low, it's not like they had to create a complete game, the rules are the same since 35 years...)\nBut the most important is that the number of teams available (8) is so small you get bored really fast...how in hell can they thought 8 races for a modern 50 bucks game would be tolerated ? the game had bad reviews from players mostly because of this and it's totlally normal. BOREDOMBOWL 2...To finish, on 10 matches today , i had 7 times a match against Lizard Men who at this stage of the game is the team everyone plays because it's OP and that's one of the consequence of all this lazy greedy (dlc..) décisions of Cyanide..it's a game of our times, fake work for quick cash.","September 28, 2015","false","59.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

However sometimes it comes down to sheer dumb luck.  It can be frustrating and enjoyable depending on which side of the ball your on...\n\nWith all that being said I am going to post one reason alone not to get this game which is the actual match making functions...  Several times now I have been matched up against teams over a thousand points ahead of me.  When my highest guy is level four and his lowest guy has more experience then my entire team put together...\n\nYes the game then gives you inducements in the form of petty cash.  However if the person your going against is that high ranking he usually has some freegold to buy his own as well.  That and even with what you can buy those basic skills the player has leveled up are better by far then anything you can buy and your regular team becomes just targets...\n\nSo why not to buy?  Because against those teams that the computer matches you your only option is to quit out.  If you play them they will literally just kill and injure all your players to the point you have to delete your team.\n\nI understand I am not going to win every match however until the matchmaking system has a cap limiting such a huge imbalance it is simply  not worth playing.  Investing 20 hours into a team then having it wiped out because the computer thought your level 3 and 4 guys can take on another  team of level 7s with full inducements...\n\nThis game does have potential it needs to have some serious looks at certain functions of it as it stands though.","October 1, 2015","false","74.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I played Blood Bowl Chaos Edition for 35 hours and then played Blood Bowl 2, all of it in the last one week. Blood Bowl 2 is definitely superior except for one thing- there are only a 7-8 races available. The rest you have to buy. But other than that Blood Bowl 2 is definitely suprerior in a number of ways. The UI is much better. Graphics are vastly improved. My most favourite feature is Cabal TV, where one can watch replays of games played by other players in the community. A lot of multiplayer games tend to miss out on this feature and I am glad it was implemented here. And yes it is leaning towards multiplayer competitive online play. There are single player competitions you can create against the AI if you like. But the main fun is joining one of the open leagues and playing human opponents.\n\nThe game may not be worth $49 for the lack of content in the form of races to play but I bought it on sale (yes its on sale already!) and its a bargain for that price. Dont be in doubt! Buy it!","November 12, 2015","true","67.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

After that instead of doing what they have done in the past to re-release the game again for the same price, they will sell the different races as DLC so you can handpick exactly the ones that you want (don't worry - as a new player you get all the races you need from the start to play a ball game, a punching game or a pretty standard well balanced team that can pack a bit of a punch and pass around the ball at the same time; YOU DO NOT NEED ANY ADDITIONAL RACES TO ENJOY THE GAME this is for when one is more experienced and wishes to dedicate more time and money to the game) for a reasonable price.\n\nCan I recommend the game? The game seems to be without any glaring bugs that made it darn difficult to enjoy Blood Bowl 1 Chaos and Legendary Edition, the UI is clear as a blue sunny day, the gameplay inputs feels responsive and direct (no excessive amount of clicking necessary as this games uses a mouse and keyboard in other words), excellent models and amazing graphics...\nI will say this much: this is a good time to be a Blood Bowl fan or someone who's interested in Blood Bowl as I can full heartedly say that this is an EXCELLENT digital version of Blood Bowl! If you like management games but just wished you could punch that annoying fellah' who makes it more annoying... welcome to Blood Bowl where the ball is a secondary objective (still required to score to win tho') and punching people to death is a fun and viable tactic!\n\nGet the game! xD","September 22, 2015","true","43.7"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

Singleplayer kind of hidden, campaign is really bad / TL;DR at the end\nthe whole review is rewritten after another player pointed out a terrible mistake I made\n\nSo lads, I played Blood Bowl 1 a lot and I played already a good bunch of Blood Bowl 2 Multiplayer.\n\nI love Blood Bowl, I love every single aspect of an ACTUAL blood bowl match. You get exactly this by choosing Play In A League.\n\nHowever if you were here to play campaign... he...hehe....well enjoy playing with humans only.\n\nIf you're new to the game, please get somewhere blood bowl 1, do the tutorial in there and then play blood bowl 2 singleplayer/multiplayer. DO NOT expect ANYTHING from the campaign.\n\nYou apparently can't pick races (it forced me to play humans) and after the third match I was fedup with the super slow approach they offer here. Third match and the actually interesting features of blood bowl are still missing and will maybe show up in the fourth match.\n\nHowever I lost my patience to even try it.\n\nIf you just want to play a campaign with some generated story or whatever you expect, I suggest wait until the devs realize what is wrong or introduce a proper campaign mode. Meanwhile, enjoy what the game is about and play leagues. (I suggest multiplayer)\n\nIf you already bought the game and you only want to play campaign, Give multiplayer a chance. It's worth it and shows the spirit of Blood Bowl!\n\nTo the devs: If you really introduce players to this game with a "Campaign" (Tutorial) which at the third match doesn't even show half the actual rules, you were probably drunk when one of your game designers presented it to you. Or he's a really good friend and no one dared telling him that it's a bad idea. Some players might loose their patience and don't even get beyond the third match and just give up on the game, as it feels incomplete when playing the so called "campaign". Do something about it before it's too late. Especially about the fact how hidden the soloplayer mode is!\n\nHere a guide on how to get to the singleplayer, before you start the same flamewars I attended to start in the original post\n- Go to Team & League Management\n- Create a team as you desire it!\n- Now go back to the mainscreen and click Play In A League\n- Select your team\n- Click in the bottom right corner Join A League\n- Choose Solo\n- I let you figure out the rest, you found it now anyway :)\n\n\nTL;DR:If you want a better tutorial, I suggest playing Blood Bowl 1\nIf you bought Blood Bowl 2 already but you want to exclusively play singleplayer... possible, but don't confuse the so called "Campaign" with the singleplayer\nMultiplayer is awesome\nPlay the multiplayer!\nIf you only consider playing singleplayer, give multiplayer a try, it's just more fun and doesn't matter that your team loses players in single or multiplayer.

The production value is really great for what it is.\n-Though not perfect, the AI has improved quite a bit.\n-It's better than its predecessor, Blood Bowl: Chaos Edition, in every way EXCEPT...\n\nCONS\n-...only 8 of the 24 teams are included in this release, and further teams will be made available via DLC (which, according to current rumors, will be around $6 each, so not godawful).\n\nTo be honest, I don't find the DLC prices to be that heinous. You will still be able to play against someone using a DLC team even if you don't own it. Don't like playing as Halflings? Don't buy it. Really want to play Pro Elves (we hate you)? The DLC costs as much as a sandwich. It's only a problem if you absolutely feel the need to have every single team, which I think the majority of players don't.","September 22, 2015","true","4.1"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

You make a team of 11 players (giving them all unique names) and fight against other people. You knock over enemy players, you grab the ball, pass the ball and hopefully score and win. After the game, you get skill points for your players and level them up.\n\nBut here's the thing: When your players get tackled or hit or just generally ♥♥♥♥ up, they have a chance of getting an injury or dying. This injury or death is permenant. You may go into a game with 13 players and come out with 10. Or 9. Or 8. An injury might cause your star player might come out with a permenant unremovable stat point loss. And this handicap will persist FOREVER.\n\nAnd the best part? If the dice and RNG are against you, there's absolutely nothing you can do about it. A tiny level 1 Goblin can kill a giant level 5 troll on the first turn if the dice are with it.\n\nEvery Blood Bowl team is thus a ticking time bomb that's just one game away from being destroyed forever. My High Elf team is 13-2-3 and riding high, but I know very well that the day will come. The day when I roll double 1's on a block and use a reroll to get another set of double 1's. The day when one of my Blitzers will fail an 83% success rate dodge and immediately die. The day my most valuable player is killed by a Turn 16 spite foul by some bitter Russian I just swept 4-0. I know that it'll happen.\n\nPerhaps it's that thrill of going against certain doom that makes Blood Bowl a thrilling affair. But regardless, until that day comes, I'm enjoying the game quite a bit.","September 27, 2015","true","30.2"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wehee/recommended/236690/","wehee","Mr Melon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wehee/","126 products in account","Welcome to the game of rolling dice, a simulator where it doesn't matter who you picked or what you do, because every decision you make comes down to whether you can roll 1d6. I played 12 games of this 'game' and let me give you a rundown of how each turn plays out. You get to move your players into positions to give them strategic advantages then fight the other team to knock them down. The most common 'advantageous' roll you'll get is 2d6 to pick one depending on what you want.\n\nSo you roll 2d6.\n\nDouble skulls. Skulls knock down your player, not theirs.\n\nSo you use one of your "team rerolls" to change the outcome.\n\nDouble skulls. Your player falls over and your turn ends instantly.\n\nYou haven't moved anyone, or done anything. Your turn is done. The other guy then takes his turn, knocking down every single one of your team regardless of the odds. Heck, he can roll 2 dice disadvantaged and he'll 100% of the time score adouble knockdown that you can't avoid. Half of your team will be injured or KO'd in the first round and unable to play for the rest of the game which is IMPORTANT, as he now outnumbers you 11 to 5.\n\nNow it's your turn again. Somehow get 2d6 to roll.\n\nRoll double skulls.\n\nUse a reroll?\n\nDouble skulls.\n\nYou're saying to yourself at this point "wow, this guys just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tting. What a ♥♥♥♥♥ this never happens to me". I played 12 games and this happened at least once in EVERY SINGLE GAME. Did it happen to my opponents? NO. If they tried to make plays where they needed to dodge twice, each time at 17%, would they make it? 100% of the time, yes. Not a single person I played against lost more than 2 rolls in the entire match. By the time it got to game 10, I was so sick of this rng nightmare that I was conceding on the third turn after most of my team were dead or had broken legs and missing limbs while his players were at the line with not a single penalty.\n\nI was under the impression that thinking about this game mattered in some way, but trust me, it doesn't, If I could go lower than 1/10 I would for this, but for the sake of it, lets just leave it at 1/10. Without reducing my settings to the lowest possible on quite a high end machine, the game crashed out constantly or took so long to register an action that a quarter of my turn was already wasted by the time people moved. On the first day I played, the servers were so broken it was disconnecting people midway through the match which forced both teams to concede a loss.\n\nThis game is -not- playable in its current state and I would not recomend any of you spend even £5 on something you could replicate by buying 3d6 and shoving them down your friends throat while their young children watched. £35 is like asking a poor man for 3 of his limbs to give him a cup of water, not even slightly worth it.\n\nDO NOT BUY THIS GAME.","October 6, 2015","false","46.0"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","3","9","0","0"

After investing 70+ hours into the first game, and having played the real life Blood Bowl, I pre-ordered the game.  Played some people online, played the campaign, and more.  There are some things to recommend about the game as well.  The gameplay works as expected, and the graphics are well suited.\n\nBut there are a few things that irk me.  First of all, the campaign was sold as this major ongoing plotline with new stuff happening.  But it's not.  First of all, the campaign is actually a tutorial.  The first few games don't have certain thigns enabled, and since it takes around an hour to play a game, it's not until 4-5 hours into the game when the campiagn actualyl opens up.  But then it doesn't, becuase many things happen to help you win.  There are things that will kill your foes, and people that will join your squad mid game, and you are almost always given sigifcnat advantages.  Also, as my team increased its BV, the opposing team never got to purchase things to make things a bit more even.  With all of thse advantages (easing into the rules, various things given to you to beat your foes, and no assistance if you outrate your foes, no spirling expenses, etc) I finished the campaign after 15 hours or so, and never conceded a goal.  It was never close.  Therefore, the campaign, a major selling point of BB2 was a total and abject failure.\n\nWhat else?\n\nWell, I created some teams, went online, began to get some games on.  Made a league for games vs the AI as well, and even released from the shackles of the campaign, the AI is poor.  It can be severely exploited by knocking players into the crowd, and doesn't learn from mistakes.  If I send one player into the crowd in round two, they should protect the sidelines more later on, but they don't.\n\nWhile I like that I get both Lizardmen and Wood Elves from launch (Thanks!), games online are getting very repetitve very quickly.  You have a 30% chance of running into an Elf team (if everyone plays all teams equally), and then Skaven are really run-ny fast too.  And then you have a handful of bash teams (Chaos, Dwarf) with some middle of the road teams to finish.  There's very little diversity.\n\nOne of the great things about real Blood Bowl, playing on a webiste like Fumbll, or playing in the first BB game from Cyanide is that you can play against enough teams that you never get bored.  You can run into Halflings and Goblins, Undead and Norse, Ogres and Vampires.  The choices for which teams made the cut staggers me a bit.  Why are all three 3 core Elves (only the Pro Elf team is missing) added when not one Undead team is included?  The only good thing here is the new Bretonian Team.\n\nAnd with games getting very redundant, and with options to head to AI  also so, and with a campaign that was a joke, I simply cannot, in good conscious, recommend this game.\n\n\nEverything that's wrong is fixable.  More teams, fix the campaign or add a real campaign, and such.  But until that happens, Blood Bowl II just can't punch high enough to overcome it's challenges.","September 27, 2015","false","39.2"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

Second the AI cheats a lot in this game. The play will always get terrible dice rolls. While the AI will get good rolls for most of the time.\n\nThe teams have some poor balance as well. With the two DLC teams being far better then the standard teams. Making the dlc feel like they are pay to win.\n\nGood luck playing MP. First you have to sign up for a league. Then spend the next few hours hoping someone in the league will want to play.

When the push comes to shove, this game is about little more than dice rolls. Yes, there are things you can do - using a player with X skill to attempt a particular action instead of player with Y skill, so on and so forth - ultimately though, nothing matters but the randome result of a dice roll.\n\nLong time players tell newcomers all sorts of things ad nauseum about risk management and smart chance taking. Those players remind of the gamblers who believe they have 'a system' for winning at craps, or roulette, or keno, or slots.\n\nThere may be things you can do to slightly nudge the chances of success of failure in your favor but, in the end, nothing but the end result of the dice rolls matters and games can be won or lost on a single good/bad roll.\n\nWhile that certainly fits the description of a 'game of chance' it is definitely not, a strategy game. And the dice roll essentially renders pointless any actions taken by the actual player(s). You could eliminate graphics, teams, stats etc. and just roll dice at each other for an hour or so and tally up who had the most 'good' rolls. Then have one final roll to see who won, and that's your winner.\n\nThat's Blood Bowl.","December 28, 2015","false","174.3"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

The gameplay is great and way easier to get into than the first one. But the full game just isn't a good deal. You're paying close to full retail for 8 races/teams. Each team feels different but there aren't enough of them in the base game. Then the extra teams are coming out as DLC, which initially wasn't a big deal but it is when they cost $8 each (and the first two were pretty much day 1 DLC). So for 10 teams you're paying full retail at $60 but the game’s lack of content just doesn't warrant that. Not to mention it now has micro transactions that shouldn’t be there.\n\nThe campaign is a good way to get familiar with the game and it helps new players learn quite well, albeit slowly. The matchmaking system isn't great if you just want to play a random team, with specific match options. Then new UI is great and the animations are cool but it's just lacking too much content to justify its price (and it's DLC's). Being able to plat a local game is great as playing with someone else on the same PC is really enjoyable.\n\nIt’s fun to play and can be picked up by new players that are willing to learn but there isn’t enough here to justify the price. The full game price, day one DLC and micro transactions just shouldn’t be encouraged.

I've played the first Blood Bowl 324 hours, and I loved it.  It had a few bugs, but it was great.  This new version is a disappointment, but it does have good things: it's nice looking and has awesome slow motion views of the hits.  That's it.\n\nAnd now the bad things.  The user interface (generally speaking) is terrible: in many cases, you can´t tell some positionals apart (eg. dark elf linemen, blitzers, runners) and it's really annoying clicking through all your players to find the one you're looking for...  Then, when you are getting hit, you sometimes don`t know which player it is, making the use of your ability Stand Firm, for example, a game of guessing if you want to use it or not.  And it's terribly annoying to have to put you mouse cursor over every ability icon on the player's stat card to know what abilities he has (why not have it be text like in BB1?).\n\nAlso when playing, you don't have the sound cues you had in BB1 to know when it's your turn.  It's easy to not realize, the opposing player has finished his turn and the timer is running against you...\n\nFor some strange reason, you can no longer see your team's stats (or your's as a coach).  You can only see games won.\n\nAlso, for some strange reason, the rules aren't the same as in the first game (or the tabletop game): human catchers don't have the same stats, you don't have to declare a pass at the begining of the players action, etc.\n\nAnd then: 7€ per race?!

I'm sure more teams will be added as DLC down the line, but releasing a game at full price and adding essential elements for more money is just not okay.\n\nNote: I have not had a look at multiplayer yet.\n\nGeneral comments on the AI:\n\n- The AI still doesn't know what turn it is. It'll risk players Going For It to get closer to the End Zone in turn 8 or 16, even with no chance of scoring.\n\n- If the AI manages to pick up the ball in an opponent Tackle Zone, they'll stop moving. No atttempts to dodge out.\n\n- The AI will dodge out of the enemy ball carrier's TZ in order to make irrelevant blitzes or assists elsewhere.\n\n- The setup is randomised. Yes, really. The AI doesn't set up according to your setup, it just picks a random formation. Furthermore, setting up your players is a very slow and dull affair; you have to wait for each player to run to the designated spot, one at a time. There is no need for this whatsoever.\n\n- The AI really likes standing (or setting up) next to the sidelines. Jim and Bob are talking about why this is a really bad idea, but apparently, the AI programmers didn't listen to them. On that note, Jim and Bob look like they've been dubbed from another language; their mouth movements are just generic animations that go on while they're talking.\n\n- Even with the improved graphics, it's harder to tell the difference between the players. The only difference between players in the same position is the head. With identical helmets, this does very little to make them stand apart.\n\nI am very disappointed. :/","September 24, 2015","false","6.2"," 9 of 22 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","9","22","0","0"

Its literally laughable how nonrandom it is in its roll results.  Its an epic fail second only to the poor match making that results in a higher level team decimating your squad through injuries, literally breaking it to the point of non recovery. You will purchase this game and rage quite within 10-20 matches.  Sadly it could have been a lot fun and solid to play if they just let random be random rather then the crap they produced with all the rule changes from the board game.

If you like turn-based strategy games with campaign modes that allow you to build up your team members, such as XCOM, you will love BB2.\n\nYour players earn xp by injuring other players or scoring touchdowns, allowing them to add skills when they level up. A real part of the magic is that each time a player levels, you roll dice to see which skill trees you're able to choose from. This results in many players having very unique and situationally powerful skills which allow you to employ and explore interesting and divirgent tactics on the play field.\n\nIf you're turned off by sports games, don't let that dissuade you from BB2. At it's core, it's a tactical turn-based combat game with rich team and player progression.\n\nRandom tips:\n\n- Be wary of reviews and review scores for BB2. A small group of die-hard Games Workshops fanboys were upset that the developer didn't make BB2 exactly the game they wanted. They're making a coordinated attempt to drive down the review scores of the game.\n\n- After 75+ hours, I've had no crashes, encountered no bugs, and had no other issues.\n\n- The interface is perfectly fine and I've had no trouble finding everything I need. (the registration button for leagues threw me off the first time, but once I realized I had to click on "Registration" it was fine)\n\n- BB2 is hard core. There are no save games. Players can and will get permanent injuries and can and will die. If they die, they're dead. It's refreshingly awesome.\n\n- The multiplayer online play is amazing. Join the official league (22k members currently) with a new team and you'll be matched with a random opponent. The games move fast, with a play timer that seems just about right.\n\n- Solo multiplayer is also great way to learn the game and start building up a team.\n\n- BB2 is a tough and challenging game. If you're having trouble, consider starting a Dwarf team.\n\n- The single-player campaign is meh. I'd recommend skipping it entirely unless you're into that sort of thing.\n\nThe GW fanboy mudslinging campaign aside, BB2 is overall and amazing game and, in my opinion, a serious contender for game of the year.","September 26, 2015","true","437.9"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

They know what goes into rules construction, game design, advancement methodology. But table top games don't always translate well to computer games when you make it literal.\n\nREMOVE THE SIX-SIDED DIE. It isn't accurate, it isn't honest, it isn't true, period, the end, so long, goodbye, we're done. There are too many interconnected pieces of design, too many items that need to be weighed for this to possibly be accurate. That die is weighted, with intention, in order to reflect the other character additions of opposing teams. So stop pretending some random shmuck is going to have a 1/6 chance to get a 6 and rough up an 1800 team rank. It's complete garbage. I played 8 games as various low-level teams, maxing at maybe 1050 or so. I played another 8 games in the 1400 or so rank, and well, I declare, my rolls dramatically changed. There was a teensy tweak of strategy, but that's about it.\n\nRemove the die. It makes people think they actually have a decent chance on plays they don't. Use a counter, a dial, something that goes to 100. That die is the most infuriating thing about this game - so infuriating, that yeah, I will give an awful review, because it acts as a carrot but is really just a big stick. Fix the die, remove the die, replace it with something that makes sense IN A COMPUTER GAME. This is a statistical game, make it some blue LED powered by Bloodweiser.\n\nI'll likely continue trying to get better at this game, though the learning curve is not crazy, because it can be fun. But like cake, the die is a lie.\n\nAfter this little deception is the artwork, which in general is great. But many times, too many times, due to the artwork meant to warn users of potential pitfalls (such as multiple dodge warnings) being opaque, they'll be hidden behind one another. You may be willing to risk an 83% dodge chance, but it's hiding a 17%. And that's when all the warnings actually appear. To say nothing of the dice rolls glitching and not displaying. This isn't a "bad" game, but it's definitely still a buggy one.","October 3, 2015","false","12.8"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","2","8","0","0"

I want to write a review that says "You should go out and buy this game NAOW! o 3o "...  BUT...\n\nThe RNG (Random Number Generator, used for dice rolls in this game) will make you rage something awful.  This game is in an AWFUL need of a rebalance.  And I don't mean the rules that the mechanics of the game follow.  I mean the fact that the AI habitually gets far better rolls than you do and does so on a consistant basis.  I mean that the Lizardman race is OP.  And this isn't the only beef I have.\n\nPositives:\n+ Decent Graphics\n+ possibility of carnage on the field\n+ For some reason, I keep coming back to the game....\n\nCons:\n- Emotionally dead cheerleader clones.\n- RNG HATES YOU!!\n- Where are the Amazonians and Valkyries?  You have icons for them in game and yet NO WORD on release date or even if you're planning to release them?\n- RNG HATES YOU!!\n\nHonestly, my main, heart breaking complaint is how unfair the RNG is.  I know it doesn't sound like much, but when EVERY ASPECT of the game hinges on it?  It becomes a gamebreaker.  When I'm failing 8 out of 10 rolls that have a 83% chance of success, that is NOT a chance of success!  And I use this as an example, but there are FAR MORE examples in the game.  Players can talk all they like about positioning, skills and what not.\n\nThe only winning move is not to play.\n\nI would recommend this game ONLY in the vain , vain hope that the RNG is addressed in the future (which is NOT likely) and that the races I am looking forward to make it to the game SOON (as of this moment, 3 new races have been announced, but none of them are Amazonian or Valkyries)\n\nFor now... get this game on sale, if you must.","February 11","false","32.1"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

And if for some reason you have to stop playing in the middle of the game - the game will be considered automatically lost and there's no way to replay the match. Yeah that means you auto-lose in whole leagues.\n- no fullscreen (seriously) thus quite possibly worse performance\n- graphics settings are almost non-existent (overall detail level + grass and that's it)\n- combat looks way duller - surrounding teammates do not throw punches anymore when close to the attacked player. Cutscenes for combat get old fast (a single animation per player class) so they don't help. Even minor thing like running across the touchdown line when you have moves left before scoring is out - it's instascore.\n- there are only human cheerleaders, thus no race specific ones and their number does not depend on how many your team has\n- only 5 stadiums. You can upgrade them visually, making them bigger - but since camera controls are gimped (only zoom in) you can't even check them out right. And since all of them are covered with the same grass - you can't even tell them apart most of the time.\n- only 8 races. Yeah I know it's a total remake with completely new assets yet the fact remains - Chaos Edition has 23. And 10 stadiums.\n\nBasically - avoid until fixed (if ever) and get at a 50% discount.\n\nTL;DR: WHAT THE F-","September 24, 2015","false","4.9"," 11 of 27 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","11","27","0","1"

They play terribly, even a new player (Which I was) Can annihilate the AI, even when they have a better team.\n*There's near no dialogue in-game, despite a heavy focus being on the commentators of the game.\n*The animations are very repetitive, on the starting line-up you will often see everyone in the exact same pose, barely moving at all.\n*The animations are repetitive and aren't indicitive of anything in-game.\n*The art in-game is very low poly and low-res, yet the game forces you to be direct x11 compatible (Which means Windows 7 users can't play this game)\n*The game sells each pack of characters at around $10. It's a blatantly bad way to handle dlc, especially so early in.\n*The campaign is extremely short and half-♥♥♥♥♥.\n*Multiplayer matchmaking is added terribly in this game. Your opponent is random, there's no shaping to skill. You can only battle people within your own league, which is basically a group you join. It's a horrible system that makes the game terrible to play if you don't have friends, or good luck on who you fight.\n*The game is basically the first game again, I usually don't have this complaint about this, but I'm upset in this case.","September 23, 2015","false","35.5"," 10 of 25 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","10","25","0","0"
