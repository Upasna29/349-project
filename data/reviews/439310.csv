And they DID! But I love challenges. And big pixels! In fact, though it might not be immediately obvious, it made me think od Hotline Miami -- another game that I didn't feel I stood a chance against and yet tried anyway. Lo-res and intense gameplay aside, you'll find familiar themes of extreme violence and the protagonist's slow descent into madness, including terrifying hallucinations. It's dark, it's gritty, with just the right amount of tech-noir camp and dystopian grotesque. Just like HM, Until I Have You is hard. You'll die. A LOT! By level 4 of Chapter 1 you'll think: hey, I'm getting good at this! -- and for that level 5 will kick you in the shin. Repeatedly. I think I got my 1000 deaths achievement while battling Boss #1. And it'll only get crazier from there. Chapter 4 will have you wonder if it's humanly possible to get through. But you will. You'll learn that the right moment to jump up before an incoming wave of fire is when the flames start bursting right in front of you, and not before (because otherwise they'll burn you when you fall). You'll figure that the right moment to leap over enemies crawling up from below is not when they jump, it's when they're ALMOST in your face as you dash right at them at full speed. I'm currently on level 5.3 -- and needless to say it looks IMPOSSIBLE. Climbers AND divebombers?! :O Not to mention 5.2 gave me enough adrenaline for WEEK! So... enough for now. But I'll get back to it. Tomorrow! The tempo, the rhytm is just too exhilirating to resist. Sometimes it's like I'm seeing in slo-motion (without the actual slo-mo mode on). The rush is just crazy. You'll enjoy it, whether you're a seasoned platformer maniac or a timid sudoku enthusiast like myself!, Because yes, beating your record time in sudoku is ecstasy. But this is better!","April 8","true","22.0"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cish/recommended/439310/","Cish","no turning back","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cish/","90 products in account","Really atmospheric cyberpunk platformer\n12 chapters , various enemies and traps, simple but thrilling story of a killer who trying to save his wife\nYou can run fast through stages and leave all enemies behind or smash every face on your way\nYou will die. A lot. Not a reason to stop, you are an artist, aren’t you ?\nTime-dilation ability\nNormal & hardcore mode\nIn addition awesome artwork and great soundtrack\nThe only thing made me sad - delays between voice sentences, bit long and makes speech unrealistic\n\nFinally , a cyberpunk game that worth to be played.\n","May 17","true","24.2"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","1"

It's ridiculously oldschool-looking but visual design is nice anyway. Story isn't that shocking but it was interesting to experience for sure. Music and atmosphere overall are great.\n\nGame design feels unpolished though. There is enough content for all twelve areas. But levels within areas are similar and feel repetitive, followed by really easy bosses sometimes. I wish it was at least half shorter.\n\nAnd a special shoutout to the hoverboard controls at the last area. I had to set keyboard keys and constantly switch between gamepad and keyboard just to pass that nonsense and see an ending.","April 19","true","15.2"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

If you have any doubts about the validity of my review feel free to PM me.\n\nGood, solid and fair gameplay. Controls are crisp and accurate (played on Xbox One controller) and completing a stage feels quite rewarding.\nI spent around 20+ hours on the first walkthrough of the game. I kept going back because it just pushes you to play better and find shortcuts.\n\nYou'll die alot. You'll like it. You'll find it fair.","April 4","true","11.6"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","13","19","0","3"

The artwork and story give the game an artsy touch, which I like. The pixel-graphics fit into the art style and the story fits to the pixel-graphics.\nThe gameplay is great, too. The controls are responive and accurate. You can play this game fast and slow just as you like, although there are some levels with a time limit, but the time limit was allways fair sofar.\nDuring the two hours I have played I had two weapons. A baseball bat and a pistol. Both are requiered as some levels/parts of levels are easier to challenge with the right weapon, but if you are quick enough you can run past all of the enemys, but you need much skill for this in the later levels as the suroundings become more and more dangerous and it becomes easier to stand still, kill an enemy and look and wait until you know the movement patterns of the level (moving platforms, laser beams).\nBoth ways are equally fun: fast play and slow play.\n\nAnd yes you will die alot, and this game might frustrate you at some point, but if you like platformers you are going to enjoy every single death as you learn from your death. You learn how to play the level step by step until you finished it and after finishing you want to try the level again just to reach a better score.","April 5","true","2.3"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"
