He (or she) is given the task of stopping a rogue Spectre from... you guess it, taking over the galaxy (OF COURSE!) Along the way, you pick up a colorful cast of characters that help Shepard every step of the way.\n\nOne of the things I really like about Mass Effect is its approach to morality. It is not the standard good vs evil choice. To put this in Star Trek terms, Paragon Shepard is more like Jean-Luc Picard or Kathryn Janeway, always willing to go for diplomacy first. Conversely, Renegade Shepard is more analogous to Benjamin Sisko; doing whatever it takes to get the job done, and sometimes crossing the line. But even though ReneShep may cross that line, he or she, is willing to live with the decision regardless of the consequences.\n\nGameplay may seem a little archaic especially when compared to the later games in the trilogy, but there is something about it that I find charming in its design. Sure, inventory management can be a bit of a hassle, but let's face it, no game has ever really had a perfect inventory system. The shooting is solid enough, even though the guns sound like pea shooters (This only applies to the pistols. The shotguns, and sniper rifles have weight to their sound assets), and the variety of ammunition types, equipment and powers allow for a lot of replayability. Plus, you can take your completed Shepard, and import him or her into the next two games, taking your decisions with you.\n\nSo, what about Shepard? Take a seat, relax, and begin your journey to find out.","November 26, 2014","true","206.7"," 253 of 271 people (93%) found this review helpful 65 people found this review funny","93","253","271","65","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/17460/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Mass Effect is an action role playing third person shooter game, developed by BioWare. Releasing on Xbox 360, PS3 and PC. The game was released in November 2007 as a timed Xbox exclusive, but eventually got ported to PC in May 2008.\n\nThe game starts out with you being able to fully customize the appearance of the main character, male or female, abilities, and background story.  The game play is based a lot around a squad of three characters including you. There are six difference “classes” that come in the form of important characters that you encounter throughout the game. Each of these classes will level up, and have their own special abilities and talent tree to select from.  The talent tree is very detailed, allowing you to spec each class into specialized roles which you will take on different missions depending on what enemies you will be facing.\n\nThe game’ combat system is primarily in real time, but you can pause at any time to give orders to your squad. I however found this to be a very negligible feature as I had no use for it all, I don’t think I used even once. The combat is very easy to get to grasps with. A really good cover based system is included, with some really tight controls to boot. Whilst you do have unlimited ammo for your weapons, you do run the risk of overheating your guns if you just continuously fire, meaning you have to take breaks in your onslaught for a few seconds at a time or you can simply switch to one of your many other weapons. I liked the idea behind not having to scavenge around for ammunition, its 2183…it’s all lasers for gods sakes! :)  Another key game play element comes in the form of the dialogue and morality system. A really good portion of the game takes place in dialogue scenes with NPCs, your answers really do matter and can sometimes change the course of events which carry out for the rest of the game. I am not normally a fan of games which have too much dialogue, but I was completely intrigued to explore each dialogue option to delve deeper and immerse myself completely in the story. Different actions and different results will affect your morality, completing the main missions don’t really add much to the system, but a lot of the game’s side missions make you choose a “good” or “bad” resolution to them, which really makes you think sometimes.\n\nMass Effect is almost ten years old now, and whilst it is showing its age, it is certainly still an OK looking game by today’s standards.  All of the animations are really crisp. The textures aren’t all high resolution, but you have to remember the age of the game when playing. The facial modelling of all of the characters is done very well too, and even betters some of the recent titles!\n\nI played Mass Effect on the medium difficulty level, and I found the game to be challenging enough so that I wasn’t breezing through the game, but not so hard that I felt I wasn’t able to progress without having the need to grind a few levels before taking on a certain boss or mission. The only times I did find myself getting stuck, is purely a UI issue, rather than the gameplay. The game doesn’t do a fantastic job at telling you where to go next; you have a lot of maps to be able to look through, but no help at all comes for many of the side missions for where you need to go, meaning I had to look up a few of the missions online to be able to work out where to go.\n\nThe majority of the game’s levels are really well designed. There is really only one main hub of activity in the game which has an open world feel to it, and that is the Citadel. You will find a good portion of the game’s side quests in this location with plenty of NPCs to interact with as well. Each of the game’s main missions takes place on a different planet, and that planet will also have a handful of side missions for you to complete along with the main story. I would urge people to check them out as they are well worth your time, and I didn’t at any point feel like I was completing the same type of mission over and over again. All of the side missions add a great deal of story which also keeps the lore crew happy as well.\n\nI have recently just finished my second play through of Mass Effect, the first being a few years ago now. The most recent play through of the game took just under 20 hours to complete, this is with me being in OCD mode and completing all of the side missions, exploring all of the levels and interacting with any of the NPCs I came across. There is a deal of replay ability with Mass Effect, you can of course ramp up the difficulty, but you can also play the game in different styles using the morality system, and changing the gender of your character to also effect relationships with your crew members.  I would even say I could squeeze another two play throughs out of Mass Effect before I would find it hard to find something new to come across.\n\nTechnically, right now I have to say Mass Effect does have a couple of issues running on newer operating systems. Whilst I didn’t have any crashes or major bugs, I did have a few performance problems with the odd stutter every now and again. I am pretty sure it is not hardware related as my PC is more than capable of running current titles on 4k with high settings. Another pet peeve is that I wasn’t even able to run the game on 1080p; you have to put up with the lower Xbox360 resolutions. I didn’t play with a controller, as I am more interested in being more precise with my aim than anything else to be honest.\n\nMy conclusion on Mass Effect is, that whilst many of you will have probably already played and finished the game, I would still class this as a must play title for our recent memory. It is the start of a truly fantastic series, and one of the standout titles of the last generation of games. It is showing its age slightly, but Sci-fi fans will want to start here before stepping foot into the Mass Effect world.  If you can look past the aging graphics you have an absolutely stellar story and hella fun gameplay with some heavy RPG elements.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

It has a great story, lots of characters, good voice acting and cool gameplay. Even now, several years after its release and two sequels, it still holds up better than most games.\n\nThe orginal Mass Effect has something that its succesors do not have: style ánd substance. The original has hundreds of customisation options. Skill trees are huge and you can easily invest in skills that are not entirely related to your class. It is a bit like Dark Souls in that you can still adopt to suit the situation. You are not irrevocably commited to a single style. This allows you to change things up and to keep the long quest fresh.\nThis word: commitment. In Mass Effect 2 you would commit to romancing a partner, playing a class and upgrading some weapons. In the original, you spend way more time exploring, fighting and doing cool stuff in general, while still keeping the interactions with your team interesting enough for you to invest in them. Mass Effect is balanced in its commitments, not overly invested in one or the other. It does a lot of things right, but it certainly isn't the best in any area. However, when taken together, you get a very complete and incredible game.\n\nI admit, it may have some problems, like the Mako's gravity defying motions or the tedious shootouts in bunkers that lead to nothing but more worthless junk. However, if you cannot overlook these issues then I suggest you take step back and consider the point of exploring. Bioware has built entire planets for you to explore, and you complain about the space suit you found that happens to be too pink? You are missing the point. If gratification is what you want, then go play something else. Mass Effect is a genuine experience; something that needs to be played to be enjoyed. It isn't the result that matters, but the process.","February 26, 2014","true","51.1"," 112 of 119 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","112","119","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/razoinfiltrator/recommended/17460/","razoinfiltrator","Razo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/razoinfiltrator/","89 products in account","Ah, Mass Effect... how do I make this review and not sound the slightest biased at all?\n\n1- INTRODUCTION\nMass Effect is one of those cult classic games that gained recognition due to its advertisement of being a spiritual successor to Knights of the Old Republic. To some degree, yes it is. As soon as you start the game it just screams Star Trek or at the very least any old corny 80s sci-fi TV soap opera or like some people like to call it "a space opera". This is definitely one of the charms of this game. It's more about talking and finding resolutions to problems rather than pulling out your plasma rifle and shooting every space-fiend you come across.\n\n2- NARRATIVE AND STORYTELLING\nJust to get this out of the way, overall the voice acting in this game is great. There wasn't a moment where I went "jeez that was... yeah".  Although high quality voice acting is kind of already expected from a studio like Bioware. Anyways;\n\nThis being the first game of the trilogy the story aspects are still based on foreshadowing while following a basic narrative focus on an objective. In this game the main objective is trying to catch a rouge Spectre (Mass Effect equivalent of a Grey Warden or Jedi) named Saren and bring him to justice for the crimes he commits during the game. Without going into spoiler territory, the game does a great job of keeping narrative cohesiveness no matter which mission order you decide to play the game in which is something dearly missed in the next two sequels that feel disjointed at times.\n\nAs far as the companions go they're some of the best Bioware companions only slightly falling short of the Dragon Age cast but surpassing a lot of the KotOR cast.\n\nAll in all, the storytelling in this game is great and always seems to be interesting, whether it be random chatter in the background or the actual dialogue and pacing.\n\n3- MECHANICS\nNow let's get to the actual mechanics. The overall shooting in the game is above average at best. The guns feel very "pew pew" and have very little impact or satisfaction using. The main saving grace for the combat are the powers. Like any Bioware game, it wouldn't be complete without a pause button for tactical awareness, borrowing from the fact that Bioware usually specialize in turn-based real time games. In conjunction with all these powers and the overall shooting there is much to enjoy from the combat as it gives you a sense of command while not relying heavily on RNG and dice roll mechanics since it's a third-person shooter.\n\nWhat about the role-playing? Unlike previous Bioware games where you had a long list of stuff to pick they added in a dialogue wheel which would later be a staple for all Bioware games to come after DA:O. The idea is ingenious as it allows for a much more convenient experience compared to something like KotOR. As good as the dialogue wheel is the actual role-playing suffers from something I like to call "meta thinking", I'll elaborate on this later. Like KotOR you're presented with two sides of a black and white world, Paragon (basically Light side) and Renegade (basically Dark side). Like any RPG there's a persuasion mechanic but unlike most RPGs this persuasion mechanic isn't improved by leveling up your persuasion skill/talent etc. You have two persuasion skill trees called Charm (unlocks the blue ultra Paragon options) and Intimidate (unlocks the red ultra Renegade options.). This mechanic would be fine and all if the amount of talent points you can put into them wasn't capped by how much Paragon and Renegade points you accumulated throughout the game. This whole management of morality points just to get the best possible outcome is where this game really falls short. This talent point cap encourages you to only play as a Paragon or only play as a Renegade instead of mixing choices up for a more honest playthrough of what YOU would actually do. If you're planning on playing a mostly good guy you won't be facing most of these problems since getting Paragon points is relatively easy to the point where doing normal sidequests will randomly give you Paragon points out of thin air simply because you played the game. But if you're planning on doing a hardass/jerk/badass while still having good intentions (mostly choosing sarcastic lines while still playing for Paragon outcomes) kind of playthrough you're really going to struggle without "meta thinking" and planning out which options you have to be a Renegade about or a Paragon about. There were some choices I regretted doing simply because I need more imaginary morality points to advance my persuasion talent instead of actually playing the game how I wanted to play. Still, it's a little bit of a nitpick that I can't immerse myself in my character and rather go all meta and minmax what mission order I have to do.\n\nAnother concern this game has is the whole Mako sequences that take place when you land on a random planet and you take control of an exploration vehicle called "the Mako". The physics feel odd to say the least and the planets that aren't story mission related are bland and not interesting even if the sidequests on the planet are. When you first play the game it probably won't be a problem at first but if you have played this game to death and beyond like I have these sidequest missions can be a little bit of grind since controlling the Mako up long steep hills isn't the most fun thing to do.\n\n4- RESOLUTION\nDespite all the ♥♥♥♥ I've thrown at this game, it's still one of my favorites to replay every year or so just to re-experience the joy of how it influenced the type of entertainment I consume today. This will always remain a timeless classic in my eyes.\n\n8.5/10","July 13, 2015","true","80.1"," 96 of 102 people (94%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","94","96","102","6","5"

Both back when it first released and upon retrospect.\n\nMass Effect was a huge turning point with video games and its influence is still readily seen to this day. It marked the shift toward cinematic based games becoming the norm and allowing you to interact with the events. It influenced dialogue driven protagonists with their own dialogue trees and progression systems. And it modernized concepts Bioware previously did in Baldur's Gate like party romances. Much of this was done before in games like Kotor or Metal Gear Solid, but Mass Effect tied everything up into a neat well polished package.\n\nThis was a game that blew me away when I first played it. It was truly the first 7th gen game that indicated to me where video games would eventually go. It looked amazing and I fell in love with the gameplay and all of the characters. It really was a game Bioware made in their prime.\n\nNaturally playing it today will make you notice the game hasn't aged all that well. Bioware was still transitioning from mostly making turn based games like Kotor so they didn't quite perfect the gameplay til the sequel. I still highly recommend playing Mass Effect 1. It is easily one of the last great games Bioware made.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=11214103","May 7, 2015","true","128.1"," 70 of 71 people (99%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","99","70","71","3","0"

But this was released for consoles back in 2007. We have come a long way in this genre since that year so let's just accept these issues as well as the somewhat dated graphics and focus on the story instead.\n\nWell, the story is all about a commander called Shepard who is tasked with capturing Saren who goes rogue and by doing so endangers the lives of many. He is from a race called Turian and is an agent of the notorious group called Spectre.\n\nAlong the way Shepard discovers Saren is just a pawn in this game. He continues to uncover who exactly is in the background and the findings are interesting enough to have two more sequels for this game.\n\nThe sequel focuses more on the action and the third and final episode tries to combine both. At this point you have probably heard of the controversy in connection with the ending of the trilogy. It is always nice to start with the first where there were no expectations and this is where you meet the Commander and the various races living in the galaxy.\n\nThere are tons of side missions and you have your own ship to control to be able to reach the planet you desire. You meet new characters who'll join you as during each mission you control a squad consisting of 3 people.\n\nWhat makes Mass Effect really great is its depth! How the story unfolds and not just the main story but the story of each and every character important to Shepard's quest. From time to time you get to make decisions and these decisions can seriously affect the storyline.\n\nThe personality trait you have is also very important: going with the good choices makes you a paragon in the eyes of your comrades while sticking to the darker side (you see what I did there?) renders you a renegade. A 2nd walkthrough is the minimum just for the sake of seeing what could have happened if you'd gone the other way.\n\nMass Effect is a great game: Its storyline, music, voice acting (the female Shepard's voice is equally good), characters, art design are all top notch. You didn't like the casualness of the second part and the ending of the trilogy was a letdown for you? Grab the 1st where it all started. But this time, pick a different line in a conversation or a different class for Shepard at the beginning. Or a different background for him. Or simply complete some side missions in a totally different order. One thing is for certain: you'll find something new in your next walkthrough.","January 2, 2015","true","155.7"," 93 of 104 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","93","104","2","0"

Narration is fluid and players won't have any issues following the story as it expands and reach its climax.\n\n+Cast: A customizable protagonist (face, gender), ruthless villains and unforgettable companions (with different armour exclusive to their race). Expect to gain more enemies and allies as you clear the galaxy of terrorists and drug warlords.\n\n+High replay value: 6 classes that offer different play styles (sentinel, soldier, engineer, etc.), variable companion combinations, New game plus, etc. If you also add the two existing moral paths, the two protagonist genders and end game decisions you might easily spend more than 500 hours on this game.\n\n+Challenging: 5 difficulty levels to choose from; including easy, veteran and hardcore. Each difficulty level affects enemies' weapon damage as well as their skill selection and combat behaviour.\n\n+Hybrid theory: Mass Effect isn't just a space shooter. You will be constantly switching between action sequences and role playing diplomacy. Many of your previously completed quests will affect NPC's and companions' behaviour. Expect different comments depending on your previous decisions.\n\n+Battle tactics: With just a hit of a button you can pause the action and command your team to change positions or targets. You may also, depending on your class, choose different skills which may distract your adversaries (sabotage, lift, synthetic overload, etc.) or obliterate them. As you level up, more skill options become available and it will then rest on your tactical prowess to transform a hellish confrontation into a summer breeze.\n\n+From zero to hero: 60 levels to master (50 are accessible in your first playthrough), 6 companions to recruit (humans, asari, krogan, etc.), numerous skills to learn (you cannot maximize all of your skils in one playthrough, try various combinations and pick the ones you enjoy the most).\n\n+Devil or angel: Two moral paths to choose from; your overall attitude affects the NPCs' behaviour towards you as well as your appearance. Paragon attitude depicts a forgiving, humane Shepard while the Renegade path is suited for all of you psychos and vigilantes! I've tried them both and they are both rewarding and fun to play as.\n\n+Pass the legacy: After finishing the game you can a)export your saved game to Mass effect 2 and keep your key-choices and/or b)start a New game plus with your skills/characteristics intact)\n\n+Soundtrack: for a great tale to be told, a music score of equivalent value is needed. Check the whole OST uploaded by TantrisOST in youtube:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhesDs6FWpo\n\n+View: with your own spaceship land on imaginary planets, each with its own atmosphere, flora and fauna. You can also visit our Sol system for some funny comments from the crew and codex entry system. Also, on Luna...\n\n+Price: significantly low during sales.\n\nWeaknesses\n-Full pockets: In many instances, your inventory will overflow with useless weapons, redundant armour portions and obsolete ammo mods. Do not forget to visit periodically your inventory in order to clean it up or you might end up wasting half an hour during the last chapter making room for some new weapons and armour.\n\n-Choices ungiven: despite being abundant, only a few choices actually matter for the game's finale. A few other choices might end up affecting characters shown on the two sequels, but their significance is negligible for everyone who plans to play the first Mass Effect only.\n\n-The missing chapter: Unless played as part of a trilogy, Mass effect 1 seems like an unresolved tale. Also, I must add that the third game is not available on Steam and everyone interested must create an account at EA's Origin in order to buy and play the game there.\n\n-Not so challenging after all: Mass effect targets a wide audience.  Experienced players may find its simplicity frustrating and its regeneration system debatable. As an old school gamer myself, I never paid too much attention to those mechanics since Mass Effect  finds a few plot tricks to justify them. Play for yourselves and form an opinion based on your own experience.\n\nNeutral ground\n±KotOR clone: Players will identify strong resemblances to Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, mainly found at the morale system and plot structure. Bioware never hide the fact that they wanted to create their own space game and their involvement with KotOR affected Mass Effect  alot.\n\n\nMy rating4/5\nMass Effect has its flaws, mainly found in the battle system and narration pattern. Nevertheless, if you are tired of medieval cliché with dwarves and elves, try conquering the galaxy nebula by nebula while communicating with alien races or facing your galactic adversaries armed with futuristic weaponry.","January 12, 2015","true","288.1"," 63 of 72 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","63","72","0","0"

It may not seem as bad from the perspective of a new player, but various aspects just feel rough around the edges. From the UI right down to the controls, it feels very, very unrefined. The UI, especially the inventory screen, was a bit confusing the first few hours, and it never really became second nature throughout the rest of the game, as tends to happen with other RPGs. There are also some performances issues and quite a few bugs (it wasn't until after my playthrough that I realized the game didn't look awful at max settings, it was just bugged and forced everything to the lowest settings).\nWhile the gunplay and UI are a bit difficult to get a feel for at first, what this game manages to nail down perfectly is interaction with characters. You choose conversation choices from a dialog-wheel. While simple in it's execution, this small, six-segment wheel is your gateway to learning about the universe and the characters of the game, as well as the system that allows you to leave your mark on the galaxy.\n\nStory\nSomething about the setting and character's of this game really pulled me in. Perhaps it's just how fleshed out it all is. Every planet, even insignificant ones, has at least a brief write-up. Conversing with crew members reveals detailed pasts and unique personalities that leave you wishing there were more options on the dialog wheel. The varied alien races have entire histories, both as solitary civilizations, and as members of the galctic community. The universe feels vast, one of few games that manages to make you feel like there is more to the world outside of what you've seen.\n\nIf you are someone who loves to get drawn into detailed univserses, or are a fan of detailed characters that you actually start to genuinely like - or hate - Mass Effect is the game, and series, for you.","November 25, 2013","true","14.5"," 57 of 66 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","57","66","0","2"

If you disagree with my take on the game or if something is factually incorrect, please leave a comment below!\n\nGeneral GameplayThe first in a series from BioWare, Mass Effect was designed to be an open, choose-your-own-adventure type game within a relatively loose storyline.\n\nYou play as a Human Alliance Navy Commander named Shepard.  You're quickly embroiled in a fight to save not only yourself and crew, but humanity and all races in the universe from extinction at the hands of the Reapers.\n\nThe story for Mass Effect and the effects between games that your decisions have makes playing the whole series on occasion quite enjoyable.  The games can be long, so they can be daunting to try and replay.  Make sure you have time!\n\nGeneral Accessibility\nAccessibility Options\nMass Effect opens to the main menu, so you can set subtitles before the game begins.  Sound controls let you adjust music, sound effects, and dialogue volumes independently.  For gamers with mobility issues, you can rebind all keys to suit your needs.\n\nIn gameplay, there are few indicators that you are being shot at or that you were hit.  The bullet animations are fast, and you may miss them until your shield is gone already.  I often did not know I was being shot until my health was critically low, which is the first major visual indicator of damage.  This can make the game frustrating at times.\n\nSubtitles & Captions\n\nPros:\n- Subtitles are large and easy to read with light blue text and black border.\n- In conversations, you see who is talking and subtitles at the same time.\n\nCons:\n- Most subtitles are shown because you trigger them, but some come from nearby people and they are not named, so you may not know who is talking.\n\nChatting/Communicating\nMass Effect is single player; no chatting available or required.\n\n---\nVisit Games Reviews for the Deaf/HoHhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/gamereviewsforthedeaf","February 17, 2015","true","114.2"," 45 of 50 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","45","50","0","0"

Classic. Buy it.\n\nHow did it take me so long to find you, Mass Effect? Where have you been my whole life?\n\nAs you can tell from the above text (and the blue thumbs-up symbol) I rather enjoyed Mass Effect. From the get-go till the end, the in-game fiction is well woven, making this one of the best developed sci-fi universes I've had the pleasure of being involved with. The intricacy of the universe certainly puts series like Star Wars (the movies, at least) to shame. There are lots of distinct alien races with believable cultures and histories (though for the most part they are all humanoid and speak English...). The future technology is well explained with the usual pseudo-science.\n\nThe story was pretty good. As Shepherd, a man/woman in the Alliance (human) military, you start off investigating a distress call from a remote colony. Things go bad pretty quick, and you discover secrets which threaten the security of the galaxy. The next bit of the game concerns you gaining the trust of the Council (galactic government) in order to become a super-special-ops sort of dude. Then it's time to recruit a team of the best aliens and humans out there and set about saving the galaxy from it's ultimate doom!\n\nGameplay is as a 3rd person, squad-based shooter. The controls are easy to pick up, and allow you to bring up a squad menu which pauses the game and allows you to tell you squad members to use their biotic powers (think the Force from Star Wars but better) or tech abilities, or switch weapons and so on.\n\nAs a sort of space-RPG, you choose your class in the beginning, which defines what weapons and abilities you can use. You also level up during the progress of the game, allowing you to hone those skills. You can also set it so you can control the levelling-up of your squad members' skills as well. You do tend to pick up a lot of loot, allowing you to get new weapons and armour, upgrade existing ones and so on, depending on your class. Unfortunately, you have only a limited amount of inventory space, and it fills up pretty quick. I kept finding myself having to empty my inventory in the middle of levels.\n\nA great feature of this game is exploration, as you get put in command of the experimental Alliance frigate, the Normandy. You can fly her wherever you wish, and land on many planets with the Mako jeep/tank thing. Lots of people hate the Mako for its wayward handling, but I loved it! The only downside is a lot of the optional planets are pretty repetetive/boring.\n\nOne thing which I liked in this game (compared to the second) is that it is not divided into "hub areas" and "combat areas". You could be attacked anywhere, even on the Citadel (the galactic capital). You never know whether a mission will be a simple mission where you just have to talk someone down, or whether you will have to fight your way through rooms full of enemies.\n\nThis brings us to another thing. Choice. People often get sniffy when video games claim to offer choice to the users, saying they follow the same storyline anyway, whatever choice you make. Well, this is mostly true. However, there are several choices you can make in the game which are imported to the second, which can make the game much harder, or very much alter the tone.

After having enough of seeing Mass Effect mentioned on one of the lists, I decided to get Mass Effect and see it for myself. After completing a playthrough as a full out paragon war hero soldier and even imported my character to Mass Effect 2 (Where you can find my review here) and I think Mass Effect was simply outstanding. It had the best overall plot of the three games and had several unforgettable moments, there are quite a few flaws.\n\nGraphics\nFor the visuals, they took some time to get used to because in some ways it looks like you're watching a TV show in the 80's-90's. However, in time, I was able to get used to the visuals and was highly impressed. For a game from 2007, the visuals are very good. Obviously, they don't compare to Mass Effect 2 and 3's visuals, but I'd prefer not to compare this to the other games.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay is probably the weak point of the game. I understand that this game is partially a tactical shooter, but let's be real here: You don't need to use the abilities for each character, the enemies are either easy to kill or too difficult to kill, and the AI is awful. I didn't like the firing at first how it decreases your accuracy, but I got used to it after the first few missions. The gameplay definitely did not age well in the past few years, that's for sure.\n\nStory\nThe story is the strongest point in the game. Saren plays the role as the main villain very well. I wouldn't say he's top ten worthy, but he's still an amazing character. Too bad it started to get cheesy towards the end. As some people have said, Mass Effect does not actually take off until Virmire, where several of the biggest moments in the trilogy are encountered. The other characters are pretty cool, like the Krogan bounty hunter Wrex (Who is 100x cooler than Grunt in Mass Effect 2) and Liara, an Asari biotic who studies the Protheans, an ancient race who was destroyed by a certain group of people.[masseffect.wikia.com] Overall plot was the best in the series and was just awesome. I don't want to spoil it, so just buy the game!\n\nAudio\nThe voice actors did VERY well when playing their roles. I think the best of the voice actors were either Ali Hillis (Liara) or Brandon Keener (Garrus) but Wrex, Shepard, and Saren's roles stood out, too. The music is awesome and I enjoy hearing it, the only problem I have with the audio is that half of the time all you hear is "pew pew pew" coming from the guns or "Shields down!" The music should've played some more so I can here my gun going "pew pew pew" while I hear epic music playing in the background. When the music didn't play, the mission felt very bland.\n\nReplayability\nThe replayability in this game is just about as strong as the other Mass Effects, but from what I've seen from others, this Mass Effects seems like it is the one that is replayed the most. The story wraps you in to the point you've realized you played the game seven times.\n\nVerdict\nIn the end, Mass Effect is a strong start to an amazing sci fi RPG trilogy. I highly recommend it. I assure you, you will not regret it.\n\nGraphics- 8/10\nGameplay- 4.5/10\nStory- 10/10\nAudio- 9.5/10\nReplayability-  9/10\n\n.:8.2/10:.\n\n+Best overall plot\n+Great villain\n+Amazing visuals\n+High replayability\n+Solid RPG elements\n\n-Awful AI\n-Tedious combat\n-Music barely plays\n-Gets really cheesy toward the end","July 6, 2014","true","18.8"," 41 of 46 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","41","46","0","0"

The tactical 3rd-person combat with a slew of skills to cast made for some damn good fun. Compelling voice-work combined with a great soundtrack and storyline make the non-combat parts of this game very entertaining to sit through.\n\nBioWare's signature dialog options are available too, but don't always turn out to be what you expect. I don't know why they don't make the dialog options more clear. Many times Shepard (the protagonist) says something completely extreme to what the dialog option appears to be. Anyway...thats just a minor gripe. Its still fun to be caught off guard by the results of some of the dialog options.\n\nCharacter skill trees allow you to build your team to fit your playstyle. You can choose to invest in mage-like biotic skills, or beef out your weapon proficiency, or dabble in bits of both.\n\nI did find myself spending a lot of time in exploration and side-missions. The worlds are littered with bits of information that help in telling the full backstory. Side missions tend to have decent independent stories as well. My only gripe with them is that the maps for the side missions got somewhat repetitive after while. It wasn't too big of a concern since the worlds usually look pretty different form each other.\n\nIt took me a while to finally get around to playing this game. As a bonus, it looks pretty great when played with the M.E.U.I.T.M HD mod. I spent about 37 hours in Mass Effect. I definitely recomment playing it.","February 22, 2014","true","36.7"," 26 of 26 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","26","26","0","0"

This is about 9 years too late but maybe there are still people that don't know what this is.\n\nAn original world from our beloved BioWare that evokes a very real lived in feeling of a modern sci fi space opera. Mass Effect is more RPG than shooter despite it usage of firearms. Class specialization is quite important going anywhere from a soldier, vanguard/adept at biotics (a sort of sci fi magic, manipulation of dark matter) and tech specialist. Weapons training is also very important as the guns are not exactly accurate and if your character is not trained with that weapon it will be almost entirely useless as they are not accurate at all.\n\nYou play as either John or Jane Shepard, Commander in the N7 Alliance Navy. Despite what most people think of this character I believe this character to be a nobody. As in, a representative to put yourself inside of.. someone who represents anyone who actually gives a damn. As I believe that the character of Shepard is relatively inconsequential, an almost idealistic version of a real person. To make a timely reference.. a MockingJay.\n\nThis is a highly narratively driven game, at every conversation you are given the ability to choose your dialogue choices. Unfortunately, broken down it generally resorts into three types of responses. Paragon- the sort of goody two shoes, Renegade- The sort of I don't have time for this person and the exploratory reaches of exposition. My only complaint here is that certain actions grant you either paragon or  renegade points which will unlock further dialogue options in other situations but in order to use them you need to have the pre-requisite amount making playing a sort of gray character almost impossible.\n\nThe gameplay loop goes something like this. You receive a mission statement from someone main quest or not and you fly there on the galaxy map, explore a bit, land in the mako (a sort of all terrain vehicle with highly questionable physics, though I've never been to another planet so who am I to say) find a base, shoot all the things, have some dialogue, make your paragon or renegade choice, go back to the ship, get mission, fly there on the galaxy map.. you get the picture. I don't mean to sound dismissive but if you try for a lot of the side missions it can indeed get rather tedious. Though some of them are quite expositional.\n\nIn between missions you are encouraged to speak with your crew; ask them how they are doing and what they thought of the last mission, they might even divulge what they think about the bigger picture. There is room for.. romance. Should the desire strike your fancy though options are limited especially compared to the games there after this one. I should mention at this point that at the time of writing this, this is my third time completing Mass Effect 1. Additionally I have completed Mass Effect 2 five times and Mass Effect 3 three times. I did not intend on having my opinion of those games influence this review however I feel as a human that is likely going to be impossible or if at all even just unintentional.\n\nTHE GIST\nMass Effect is a world that for me personally rivals and triumphs over other Sci Fi worlds such as Star Wars and Star Trek, perhaps that is because of when I was introduced to it or perhaps because it truly is just more interesting. This is the beginning of an epic saga that is easily in the top 3 series of games I have ever played. I'm sure most people either know what this game is already or has played it as many times as I but I wanted to actually write something and sort of.. have my official stamp on it so to speak.\n\nThe cycle cannot be stopped.","May 18","true","28.7"," 31 of 35 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","31","35","0","3"

He/she can also be something in between any of these classes. This game is all about the choices you make, and those choices will affect your environment, other characters relationships with you, how cheap or expensive new weapons will be at stores etc.\n\nThe exploration mechanic of the game is based on star clusters and star systems. As you travel the galaxy and solve missions, new clusters of stars will appear on the map, giving you more chances to explore.\nIndeed, the crux of the game is exploration and the game does this part very well. As you explore, you will also gain bits and pieces of information which form the lore of the Mass Effect universe.\n\nAnd now about this game's shortcomings. Fortunately, there aren't many, and they are nothing immediately off-puting.\nThe combat and gunplay feel a bit sluggish at times, and the exploration can get tedious at times. Planetary maps are not that large, but they feel empty expect for a camp here and there, or an anomaly.\n\nAll things considered, I highly recommend this game to anyone.","October 8, 2014","true","58.7"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","25","28","0","0"

The most interesting and real characters you'll ever come across in a video game. You'll feel as if you know these characters personally. You'll be attached to them and by the third game, it'll hit you where it matters most.\n\nIt's amazing what Bioware created and it's the only video game where your decisions will carry over for an entire trilogy.

This particular game and the two sequels are going to be thought as of something incredibly special and it's a real shame some people won't  ever experience it.\n\nUnfortunately, the first game isn't very welcoming with it's endearing looks and gameplay.

Each game is extremely memorable and has so many incredible moments backed by an amazing soundtrack. From synthesizers to heart drenching piano music, the score will never leave you with a dull moment and it accompanies the characters emotions to near perfection.\n\nI highly recommend this game and the entire trilogy to anyone that wants to experience something truly special.\n","December 28, 2015","true","44.1"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","21","24","2","4"

ME is a lot like other bioware RPGs, notably KOTOR and dragon age. anyway, it gives this surreal illusion of the vastness of space but you never even leave the galaxy, you ride in YOUR SPACESHIP to other star clusters via mass relays, which basically zoop you off at FTL speeds. cool thing: your character/decisions you make in this game carry over to the second one (and then both to the third). so there's some replay value in story changes due to who you keep in your squad, who you kill/let live, results/decisions from missions, etc. 10/10, will play again (and again).","June 19, 2015","true","92.7"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","16","16","0","0"

AI called the Geth have been attacking human colonies across the galaxy, and it's up to you to stop them. Along the way you will travel to numerous planets, meeting and helping many different species. As you go along, you unravel the mystery of why the Geth have been attacking humans.\n\nThe story is absolutely amazing. One of the last few good games developed by BioWare. You make a ton of choices throughout the game, which impact both the ending, and the sequels to the game.\n\nThe combat is great too. A challenging tactical third-person shooter. Each battle requires you to plan ahead, otherwise you will be overpowered very quickly. If you are playing on harder difficulties, one wrong move could mean the end of the battle. This makes for some really tense situations.\nThere is an inventory system which allows you to customise you and your squad's armour and weapons. Plus add modifications to them. The interface for this can be annoying, especially when you have a ton of gear. But it's not too bad, and having the ability to upgrade weapons and armour is a great addition to the game.\n\nOverall, Mass Effect is an amazing Western RPG/TPS.

I mention this only because the influence is strongest in the 1st game, when the series hasn't really defined itself completely.\n\nAnyways, it stands as the black sheep of the trilogy for its odd mix of RPG and 3rd person shooter mechanics. It does, however, possess strengths the others lack. The Lovecraftian horror influence is pretty clear in some of the side quests that take you to remote planets -- the fear of the unknown, the ominous music all play into this.\n\nThe vehicular sections on the remote planets are a bit clunky, but they do a good job of establishing mystery -- you don't know quite what you're going to find. This works well in both reinforcing the trilogy's whole narrative and the general style the narrative embodies: the unknown, powerful threat, the dirty/dark sci-fi.\n\nOf course, one has to forgive the incessantly repeated interiors and textures for the side quests, this game lacks polish. If one can get past it, one will find a series of stories that help add to and fill in Mass Effect's universe, even setting things up for the sequels well.\n\nIf one does everything, the game will take roughly 45-50 hours. If one moves through the narrative alone, you can complete it in 10-15 hours.\n\nThe main story narrative has the strongest KOTOR infuence. KOTOR was a campaign across a series of planets, not an entire galaxy. Mass Effect too, is composed of fairly long missions on a small handful of planets -- each a sort of individual story that connects to the larger narrative. Or there's the fact that in both KOTOR and ME1, the player follows the antagonist, or rather retraces their steps, to discover their motivations and goals, across different planets.\n\nThis is contrasted, then, with Mass Effect 2 and 3, where the meat of the games is composed of much more compact and exposition heavy missions with a lot of tight, polished shooting across many locations.\n\nThe shooting mechanics seem to, in principle, be based on what many call a Gears of War or GTAIV cover based system. Player pops in and out of cover. However, it's pretty clunky, the player doesn't stick too well to cover and cannot navigate it very well.\n\nAdd in the fact that weapons, armor, and upgrades are doled out in a traditional RPG manner, with damage stats being compared, unique drops, the skill point based system of character leveling. and a huge inventory to sort through, and one will begin to notice that things seem out of place.\n\nIt is not so much that these elements are bad in and of themselves, but more that they don't belong together. As if the developers were unsure of what kind of game they wanted Mass Effect to be.\n\nAfter several replays, I've come to realize that they don't do a very good job of leading up to what is supposed to be the central twist of the narrative, the big reveal about the focus of the whole trilogy, the thing to make the games all connect. Avoiding spoilers, I mean the event with the 'virtual intelligence' on Virmire late in the game.\n\nAnyone replaying will notice that the game will go so far as to basically tell, through other characters, the player directly what the narrative reveals later in a manner obviously meant to be climactic. It is again, odd, unpolished, and atypical of BioWare, much like the entirety of the game.\n\n**SPOILERS AHEAD**\n\nBesides feeling out of place and sometimes unpolished, the game has a lot of content, has mechanics that work even if feeling awkward, and manages to present an engaging narrative -- I still get rather excited when Joker commands the fleet upon Sovereign in one of the final scenes. Mass Effect's cinematic presentation is fantastic and never fails to make me feel invested in the story.\n\n(If, again, one can forgive some of the cliches like checking the body of the villain to make sure he's dead only to discover him alive or thinking the hero is dead only to have him reemerge triumphantly. I think it is possible to view these little storytelling sins sympathetically, cute little mistakes of young Mass Effect)\n\nI spent around 150 hours (100 on my Steam copy) on this game over several playthroughs. As I said at the beginning, I have a lot of issues with the series and it definitely isn't perfect. I can't deny though, that they do some things so well, and are so unique that they are games we can conclude are worth playing, worth discussing, worth evaluating.\n\nDespite the game's flaws, odd qualities, and weird inability to define itself, I have to recommend it for all it does well, for starting a great trilogy and for leading into the best game of the series: Mass Effect 2.","December 30, 2014","true","99.2"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","0"

The combat mechanics and the use of biotics have been better implemented in this game than in ME2 and ME3. Too bad they didn't stick with this combat UI. Also the way that weapon upgrades work is much more extensive then with it successor games.\n\nMass Effect one has the strongest storyline of the three games, but as a result, lacks a bit of character development. You don't get to know the characters as well as in ME2 with the loyalty missions. The dialogue is strongest in ME3.\n\nThis game is easy to get by for a few bucks during sales and is definitely worth it.","September 30, 2014","true","31.3"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

Humanity, in its efforts to into space, exluding Poland, find a ancient alien relic called the Mass Relay at the edge of the solar system. They activate it, which is apparently a big no-no, and starts a interstellar war with a alien race called the Turians, it's okay though because you can bang one later. All greviances lost.\n\nDepending on the backstory you picked for Shepard, there is a chance he can compete with Batman on the world's deadest parents competition. As part of the Earth military, Shepard is sent off to a planet called Eden Prime where he must find out what happened to the country bumpkins and their space farms. He finds corpses, oh no! After the death of a Spectre, this games version of the hall monitors, Shepard is brought to the forefront of the galactic community as the first human hall monitor. Gonna monitor those halls so good. Through his Star Wars journey, Shepard discovers new friends, bitter enemies, and discovers his infatuation for blue buttcheeks, you go Shepard, get that blue berry.\n\nThe combat is a mix between RPG elements and cover based shooting. You hide behind chest-high walls while popping out occasionally to shoot some fool or hit them with your Jedi mind powers. Like all older Bioware games, Mass Effect likes to tell you what's going on. There is a codex that covers aliens, places, alien places, weapons, alien weapons, goblin darts, and historical events, and alien historical events... Did I mention the aliens? They're kind of important.  I appreciate the time they took into making the game feel like it has it's own world instead of just being a series of events.\n\nThe story isn't the greatest thing ever, but it does enough to get you lost in it and forgetting that you live on a raft going down the Mississippi because you won one too many hobo fights without throwing the match. Let's see you catch me now, Booker.\n\nShould you play Mass Effect?\n\nThe characters are fun to be around and the story and gameplay is engaging enough to keep you interested. Your journey for blue butt cheeks should last you a few hours and it will probably keep you interested enough to play the sequel. Not the second sequel though, don't do that to yourself, you're beautiful and don't deserve that.\n\nI give Mass Effect two butt cheeks out of ten.  President Kennedy was the fastest random speaker in the world with upwards of 350 words per minute.\n\nAlso, I have a curator now, you should probably check that out if you like reading the stupid crap I type out on here.

In newer machines it’ll require some tweaking to acquire the best results. Some things are unavoidable though, for instance, the max resolution is 720p, but other issues can be improved. In my experience the “motion blur” setting didn’t work out well: Shepard was always “shaking”. Other issue was the V-sync setting: no matter what I did, it simply wouldn’t work, the game was always at 62~63 fps and I would see screen-tearing literally all the time. Luckily there’s an easy solution for this: I simply activated triple-buffering in the GPU settings, overriding the game settings (then I activated V-sync in the game settings and restarted it: problem solved). Another issue was the Steam Overlay: in order for it to work with the game, I needed to open Steam as an administrator (Win 8.1).\nNow that the technical issues are taken care of, let’s see the pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n•	Massive game: at least 30 hours of gameplay are guaranteed.\n•	Over the top replayability value: you can play as Renegade, Paragon or any mixture of both. Your choices will affect not only the story of ME 1, but also the subsequent titles of the franchise.\n•	The game is funny. Although Shepard appears to be serious, there’s a subtle humor to many of his lines/actions.\n•	Outstanding voice-work: Seth Green (Joker), Keith David (Captain Anderson), and Mark Meer (Shepard) are incredible. Overall, the whole cast is consistent.\n•	You can punch a NPC for no apparent reason.\n•	Engaging story and interesting characters/classes/settings: Reapers, Protheans, Quarians, Krogans, Keepers, Turians, Volus, The Citadel, The Council, Mass Relays, etc… there’s a whole new sci-fi mythology to be found.\n•	Great graphics for 2008: even though the graphics might seem outdated nowadays, they were really impressive back in 2008.\n•	You’ll get to drive the best off-road vehicle ever: the Mako.\n\nCons:\n•	You can’t romance everyone.\n•	You’ll get lost in Ilos, no matter what you do.\n•	In the beginning you’ll have a hard time finding your significant ones inside the Normandy.\n•	You’ll be annoyed by Shepard’s lack of endurance training (he can’t sprint for 200 meters without getting exhausted).","December 25, 2015","true","26.5"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","12","15","3","0"

It has that incredible "feel" that I constantly look for in games.\n\nThe combat is often turned down by many players as they find it difficult to deal with and boring, but I think that it's a nice addition to this game's originality! It's a lot different than combat in most games, but that doesn't make it bad -  at all -  for me.\n\nThe music. Oh man, the music. Whenever I hear for example "Vigil", "Vampire Ride", "Liara's World", past the halfway of "Uplink" or any Citadel song, I feel great. The amazing music is a major part of ME's memorable atmosphere, though not the only one.\n\nThe galaxy is huge! There are several systems and beneath those star clusters to explore. On the planets' surface, you drive the 100% badass Mako. The vehicle has got positive and negative feeback - I don't quite understand how anyone could diss that beast!\n\nLots of characters from several different interesting species. I love every single one! In fact, at first I was totally annoyed and frustrated by the small ball-y Volus, but now I always grin at them! They're so silly!\nI grew to really care about and like the squad mates. The alien ones, at least - they're the most interesting! There is a tough guy from the Krogan species - they always remind me of toads for some reason.  In the summer, there are some toads and frogs in my pond out in the yard - I should name one of them Wrex! Gotta love him!\n\n\nDefinitely one of the very best games I've ever played. The spacey sci-fi world is marvelous. The only space game that I would consider even better is Star Control II, a classic from -92.

While not flawless the gameplay experience it gave me was among the best I have yet to encounter in my gaming 'career'. Apart from my first playthrough of Final Fantasy 7 and, of course, Mass Effect 2 nothing comes to my mind that holds up in comparison.\n\nThe premise does not seem that extraordinary at first glance. You play as Commander Shepard (either male or female, your choice) and basically you are going to prevent the annihilation of every major civilisation in the galaxy. Pretty standard so far. But the world building in this game is so complex, so detailled it blew me away.\nEvery now and then you get entries in your Codex where you can read about the many spacefaring races, some important historic events or the different technologies you are utilizing in the game. I loved how they put that much effort into something many gamers won't even bother to read because it is not important at all if you just want to progress the story.\n\nWhat really makes the game come to life is its host of memorable characters. There are innumerable people you encounter, many of which can be spoken with, often offering multiple dialogue-tree options. Some of those will join your team and become your companions. Since I engaged all of my companions in conversations regularly between missions I started to really care about them. They are fully fleshed out personalities, each with his own motivations and wishes.\nThe main villains, the Reapers, are mostly only hinted at. But you never forget them and their looming presence in the background gives the story a dire urgency. The Reapers' henchmen you are battling are nothing grand but they serve their purpose well.\n\nThe gameplay combines elements of roleplaying, shooter and exploration games and the result gave me great joy. There were some rather unpleasant moments while traversing the surface of the more mountainous planets but thankfully there weren't that many of them. The majority of the game is spent either engaging NPCs in conversations or shooting at  enemies. Both aspects are done very well, although the shooter portion got a tiny bit repetitive at the end. But since I did every available sidequest and played almost nonstop for several days until I was done that might be my own fault.\n\nThe skillsystem is solid and you get tons of loot to equip your characters with.\n\nThere are several occasions when you have to make a decision that will have repercussions in the later games. Some are more personal and affect if a specific character will survive to come back in the sequels. Some have a galactic impact. In one case you decide between exterminating an entire race or giving them another chance. All of these moments came back to me vividly while playing Mass Effect 2 and being confronted with the consequences of my own actions.","June 17, 2015","true","35.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

In some cases it's evolution (story, enviroment, graphics, level-design, characters, quests) of SW: KoTOR with it own plot and universe, but in level-up system and battles it's devolution. Back in mid 2000's it was popular to add vehicles to the games, but if you're going to play Mass Effect I'd recommend to you finish the side quests and main story first and then try land missions and DLCs when you'll play with another backstory/class/gender etc. Otherwise, land missions can just make you rage on that game with the same type of buildings what you visit, same missions, high mountaint and Mako's driving controls. If you play on Normal and you think that the game is ez pz, the end battle will change your mind and test what you learnt with that fight system.\n\nP.S. Also, about DLCs. First DLC you can obtain for free from Origin site, but the other one is illegal to be installed with Steam-version.

It's a Third-Person RPG Shooter that vaguely feels like Deus Ex at first, because weapons are fairly inaccurate to start with, and Shepard doesn't want to take a diazepam because your arms sway all over the damn place while trying to aim with a sniper. But soon you specialize in what weapon you think you're best with after killing enemies, completing quests, etc. with skill points you earn as you level up, as well as other misc passive & active abilities. Shepard's crew on the other hand, often come with biotic and tech abilities to help you in battle, and even in things like hacking devices.\n\nThe weapons also work on an overheating system, as in they have unlimited ammo, but if you don't control your bursts well enough, they will overheat and you will be unable to use them for several seconds. There are weapon mods to reduce heat weapons produce, as well as other useful things, and ammo mods to inflict more damage, bypass shields, poison, etc.\n\nAlong your quest, you can choose to either be a saintly paragon, or a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, or somewhere in between with the whole moral choice system, and the more you use the charm or intimidate options in dialog, the more levels you unlock in the charm/intimidate skill tree in which to spend your skill points in and unlock more dialog options.\n\nThen there's the epic world map of the galaxy, in which you can continue your main quest, or pull an Elder Scrolls and do ungodly amounts of sidequesting and explore everywhere. Usually when you land a on planet, you do so with a space buggy called the Mako, which is equipped with thrusters, a machine gun, and a cannon. You explore a fairly large surface area of the planets you land on, optionally collecting things such as veins and salvage to earn exp and money. Then there's the main point of the planet, which usually involves entering a facility, or cave, or just wipeing out a camp of hostiles.\n\nYou collect lots of weapons, armors, weapon mods & ammo mods, along your way, which are magically transferred to your inventory after killing enemies, then theres a bunch of shops to buy and sell from. By the end of the game, I had several million credits, and 2 weapon mods to prevent overheating to the point where my weapons never overheated, I love when older RPGs do broken stuff like that.\n\nThe main things I hate about the game are the sound glitches, and my CPU fan going ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at all times due to the game being punishing on your CPU. But thats just some technical problems, it's a great game and it runs fine besides that, I only ever crashed once.\n\nYou can also import your save into the sequel, Mass Effect 2, and have a bunch of story elements impacted, as well as start with some bonus stuff.

In the start, it's even boring. I nearly wanted to quit it – with all those lengthy dialogues, walking around doing nothing, shooting nobody...\nWith lousy controls, inconvenient maps, generic exploration missions and awful combat system, you almost want to hate it, but THEN, in the second third of the game, the story gets better, creating emotional attachment to the characters, revealing sinister plot of epic proportion and pushing you to make game-changing moral choices, you're getting more and more excited and want to find out what's going to happen next. After the final battle you're like "WOW! That was something!" But is a great story enough to define this game as great? I don't think so. Every other aspect in this game is bad or mediocre.  So I give ME solid 7.5/10.\n\nPROS:\n\n- Great story (but only after the Citadel intro), although it's too anthropocentric and Commander Sheppard is unrealistically important and popular for a single soldier\n- Flexible and vast character appearance customisation options\n\nNEUTRAL:\n\n- Alternative scenarios, choices matter\n\nCONS:\n\n- Homogenous textures with poor attention to detail (it might not be possible at the time, but still it doesn't add up to a good experience)\n- There are times in main missions when autosave feature is not working the entire mission; if you forget to save (which might be a disabled feature, too), you risk starting all over again, which means 10-15 minutes of repeated gameplay\n- Awful Mako (vehicle) controls, often it goes the opposite direction from what you're stearing it to. Combine it with disabled autosave and falling off the cliff and there you go – repeat the whole mission again\n- Awful combat system: there are covers, which both you and the AI should be using, but, since everyone (including your squad members) are just chaotically running all over the place, it's just easier to rush forward and shoot everybody without thinking about any tactics\n- Initial weapons are awfully inaccurate\n- Inconvenient inventory system (typical RPG thing)\n- Unbalanced credits system: short of money in the beginning, millionnaire towards the end (another typical RPG thing); but, IMO, it's not worth to purchase anything anyway, you get all you need from looting\n- Generic exploration missions on another planets with mountainous terrain – it's up and down over the mountains all the time\n- Mini-map kind of sucks, because it functions only as a radar and it doesn't depict distance properly\n- Right turn doesn't work sometimes, you have to turn the camera left to enable right turn again\n- There are no markers for side missions on galaxy map; you have to read the mission description to know where you should go and it's not very convenient\n- You need to create an EA account to get the free DLC\n\nAnyway, with so many faults, I still think this game is worth your time and money, because with such flexible and vast story it was something unique at the time, earning ME a place in the history of video games.\n\nP.S. There is a way to enable gamepad support. Check out the guide section!","January 11, 2015","true","33.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/17460/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","When Mass Effect was released gamers rejoiced, as the brilliant minds at BioWare had pushed out a title that satisfied almost every western-RPG lover in the industry. We were given a ship, a crew, and a mission that took place all within the vastness of space. NPC interaction was nailed on the head with fantastic facial animations and a speech tree that branched out to many possibilities. However, it was only ever released on the Xbox 360 – leaving gamers from the PC and PS3 areas to wander elsewhere for a good space-faring experience. But gamers can rejoice once again - Mass Effect is now on the flexible platform of the PC.\n\nPlayers start out just like the 360 version – by creating a custom character (limited only by his last name) or simply selecting a pre-made one. Not only are facial features definable but the history and class of your character as well. The multiple classes to choose from basically combine three things: Biotics, Engineering, and Combat. Players can either focus on one or two of these skills creating such classes as 'Infiltrators' who use a combination of Biotics and Engineering in order to get the job done.\n\nIn the game Biotics is another way of saying 'The Force' – it is a type of dark energy that can be harnessed and relinquished upon foes in all manners of obliteration. You can push them with a spike of energy which knocks them off their feet; create a type of black hole which drains their energy; or simply use it to protect yourself.\n\nThe combat in Mass Effect can be described as a mix of squad based first-person shooting with a touch of static strategy and role playing elements. Players have four different weapons available to them which they can special in: assault rifles, shotguns, sniper rifles, and pistols. Classes that use little Combat skill such as 'Infiltrators' will usually only have one or two weapons available to them from the start of the game.\n\nWeapons play a serious role in deciding what sort of combat style the player uses. Sniper rifles are used for a more patient and distant approach, and on the other end of the spectrum we have shotguns for the up-in-your-face type of player. In between that the player can use cover to hide from enemy fire and duck out to take a few shots without exposing too much of your body. Your squad is also compiled from two squad mates of your choice. Your squad reacts and moves on their own but can also be told where to go, what weapon to use, and which special abilities to unleash.\n\nWith a simple holding down of the space bar the combat pauses completely. Then a combat menu pops up with a series of the available options that you and your squad can use. You can target specific areas or enemies for your squad to use their powers on (likewise for yourself) and also give out orders. This handy menu can also be used to evaluate attacks without any pressure. The camera can revolve around your character, providing you with the chance to spot certain enemies and think of a good combat strategy to get yourself out of sticky situations.\n\nIn Mass Effect about seventy percent of the game involves investigative work. Players will frequently find themselves roaming around planets in their 'Mako' all-terrain vehicle, shooting humongous burrowing worms and the dangerous 'Geth'. The other side of this investigative work is walking around various areas and talking to different NPC's. As with most role-playing games you can choose how you talk to the various characters in the game. Positive remarks will add to your 'Paragon' rating – essentially a reflection of how good you are to people. On the other side there is 'Renegade' where a negative attitude and a rude tongue will score you points. Depending on your good/bad ranking, NPC's will react differently and different side-missions will be available to you.\n\nGraphically, Mass Effect hits the nail on the head, although it does have a few teething problems. As is the case with new release PC games you can't expect it to be perfectly solid. The game installs fine but for people with the AMD Phenom and Windows Vista there will be a few challenges. The first time the game booted up, not all the textures were generated in their full glory. The second time after fixing the Vista problem the game booted fine with a solid frame rate and a beautiful render. However the third time it didn't even start – both Windows XP and Vista are having a few issues at the moment but a patch is on its way.\n\nAll in all the slightly rugged transition from console to PC has ended up with a decent result. The game looks even more fantastic than ever and a few extra features are on its way for lucky PC users. If you have already clocked Mass Effect on the 360 then it may not be worth having – but for the fellows that crave a large role-playing game with incredible depth and escapism then pick yourself up a copy.","January 26, 2014","true","18.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I hear rumor that it's automatically included with the game now and no longer a need to get the trillogy. I can't confirm this though. as I always move my back up file that contains the DLC I got wayyy back before EA nuked every available link for it... So I import my back up copy.\nYou wont miss anything without the PS DLC as it's a very short run, and doesn't transfer anything to the next game. Bringing Down The Sky however is fantastic and I highly recomend it. Make sure to launch the game once before trying to install it.\n\nI have far more hours in this game than STEAM reports, as I had been playing it long before they started keeping track, and now play it through Origin since steam doesn't get updates for the series to keep them working with PhysX. (Political battle with EA I'm sure...) I'm sure there are ways to make it work with steam but I guess the launcher for the game isn't that big of a deal. I just launch Origin as a non steam game to keep the overlay.\n\nRead this, it might save you a lot of problem solving and head scratching\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/masseffect/comments/2uxq1r/problem_installing_meuitm_for_me1/\n\nStill need more? Here you go\n\nhttp://forum.bioware.com/topic/215916-making-the-most-of-your-me1-pc-experience-maximizing-graphics-and-sound/\n\n\n\nHERE!\nMass Effect is a sci fi RPG set in the future. You travel between galexies trying to save the univers from a massive threat.\nThe choices you make matter. People will live or die because of them, some choices you wont even see the results from until you are playing the second or third game. You truely shape your own story and it's fantastic in every way.\nThe game play mechanics are a bit dated, as are the graphics but the mod listed above should help with the later. While the game play mechanics are dated, they aren't lacking in fun. They aren't tedius, they just aren't stream lined. ME2 has a change in this, and 3 alters game play even further. In this installment you have a inventory and can buy different weapons, armor, ammo types, and get some resonable depth with the leveling system. The next installments simplify this and you lose a lot of that old style mechanic. (I like the armor system and weapon system a lot in the first game but the ways to improve in the second game are good  as well, just different.) You work as a squad, and command each member. That beind said they do have AI and work on their own as well. You can choose to let them use their powers by themselves or, to have complete control of what they use and when they use it by issuing commands.\nYou get to explore planets, there might be random people trying to fight out for their lives, giant creatures waiting to kill you, or little monkeys stealing tech you really want to get your hands on. There is so much I would like to say, but won't at risk of spoiling the adventure for you. Get out there, suit up, and have some fun.\n\nIf you are going to play any of these games, I highly suggest starting with this one and playing all the way through. If you don't, there are things you will miss. Big things, and little things that make the series shine so bright.\n\nI'm commander Lex Lagger, and this is my favorite game on steam.

There are a few things that really put me off from playing through this game. The combat system is horrible. Fallout 3 struggled to not become a FPS and somehow it worked for the most part, but in this game it just doesn't work either way. It's not a FPS and not an action RPG either. The loot system has been 'simplified' to a point where you keep getting the same items over and over again. You can modify weapons and ammo though.\n\nThe story is okay, but it didn't really catch me. Maybe the quite obvious build up for the main character to become the saviour of the universe was a bit too much. The voice acting for the main character does its part by simply being not good.\n\nYou can travel to other systems than the ones covered by the main story, but they are boring and at best filled with some generic structures without any deeper meaning. You explore those planets using a vehicle that has one of the worst controls and physics I've ever encountered in a computer game.\n\nThe visuals are good for a game from 2008, but the music doesn't really work for the title. It's very bland electronic music that would rather fit in an elevator.\n\nI won't finish the game even if I invested over 16 hours into it so far as I don't see it becoming really interesting and the overall gameplay is just not satisfying. Why I still give it a thumbs up?

It was first developed for the Xbox 360 and later ported to the PC and PS3. The game came out in 2007, and seven years later I get down to playing it. First off, the maps were really difficult to read. I often had issues figuring out where the hell I was supposed to go. Then there were the freaking elevators. Elevator Sim 2007. Everywhere you went there were 13 elevators with 13 different awkward elevator conversations. No more elevators pls. There were some glitch’s with the gameplay itself, falling into trenches, not being able to move, getting stuck etc. The biggest issue I had was starting the actual game itself. Be aware that many computers have issues with starting or playing this game up. There are several forums that discuss different methods to fix this problem. Overall what really makes this game amazing is the storyline. Okay I’ll admit the lore went over my head, but it was really an interesting story. You get to choose whether you’re renegade or paragon, meaning are you an asshat or an asskisser? Either way you’re still an ♥♥♥. Stick all your points in charm or intimidate to get more dialogue options. The sound effects were spot on, graphics… what can you say? 2007. But the voice acting was aweesssoooommmmmeeeee.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/amazingbeef/recommended/17460/","amazingbeef","amazingbeef","http://steamcommunity.com/id/amazingbeef/","212 products in account","This game is very near to perfect. If you like RPG, this will quite literally give you a galaxy's worth of role playing.\nI'll start with the things that don't matter hugely to an RPG, but add to it and bring it to perfection. Firstly, the graphics are beautiful. Individually, tree leaves may look a little pixelated, and close-up shots of weaponry and armour suffer the same effect. However, when the graphics are bought together as a whole the effect is simply profound. Vast cityscapes sprawl beneath the viewing deck on the Citadel's wards, amazing scenery from the Presidium. All the skyboxes are filled with amazing imagery; binary star systems, meteorite showers, even simply beautiful blue skies and white clouds. Tying it all together are the little graphic effects, such as the lifelike water, or whisps of smoke and steam. Detailing on the characters, aliens, and animals are all done excelently, making the alien species not only believable, but also emotionally telling even when blue or scaley. Add to this very effective use of lighting and colours, and the option to have a 'film grain' graphics setting, and you are left with a game that is just beautiful.\nNext, the music and sounds on this game are very well suited to the gameplay. As with most RPGs, the music seems to crescendo with each new adventure or battle, however at points in this game it also brings in much more somber and melancholly sounding music to reflect the emotions of the charecters and crew aboard the Normandy. In either case, the music always seems to reflect the fact that this is a game anbout space, and definitely adds to the other-worldly feel. The sound effects in the game are not necessarilly subtle, however when playing they become absorbed into the gameplay, something which personally I applaud. All to often I find myself turning down the sound effect volume on a game for it being to loud, or doing the complete opposite as it's too quiet to hear an enemy right behind you. With Mass Effect, all of the sounds effects are well designed so that they fit perfectly into context, and are never out of place. The voice acting in this game is spot on, all the characters are capable of so much emotion, and make the game so much more believable than counterparts with lesser vocals. Even alien races have voices to match, and a variety within the races at that, rather than the same voice actor for every member of a species (Skyrim, guards, what?).\nGameplay moves fluidly, whith characters interacting very well with the environment. I don't think I ever found a character floating in mid air, or stuck inside a boulder or staircase, or limbs from a character on one side of a door potruding through to the other side. Charecters take cover when commanded, are able to peer and shoot around objects, and team commands work excelently when directed, and still work well when on automatic. Customisation of you and your team's loadout was most definitely confusing at first, however once grasped really gave the combat situations an extra tactical element, allowing choices between weapons and ammunition types for each new enemy encountered. Added to the game is a hacking minigame which allows you to unlock doors, crates and safes, and this increases with difficulty as it increases with reward, however it would have been nice for the developers to add other methods of hacking - I doubt all locks in the galaxy use the exact same system. Effectively the game has 3 levels of gameplay, the most important being on foot, secondly missions involving driving the mako, and lastly small elements from being in orbit. When in orbit you are free to walk around and interact with your spaceship, and have access to the galaxy map. From this map you can explore the galaxy through nebulas, star systems and down to an individual planetary level. This allows you to scan planets for resources, and choose to land on some of the planets to perform a mission. When on minor missions on other planets, usually you will be assigned to drive the mako, an armoured six wheeled heavy hitting tank of sorts. Equiped with some form of machine gun, a slower firing cannon, and the ability to fly for a very brief period of time, it is fun to use. The controls are a bit strange at first, with the turning not behaving quite as you'd expect, however once you've gotten used to it, the driving becomes a lot more fun.\nFinally, the part most people want from an RPG to be perfect is the story, the character interactions, quite simply, the role playing. This game SATISFIES. In playing this game you can either simply blast through the main missions and skip the dialogue, missing out the majority of the context and background, or you can take the time to talk to minor characters, pick up side missions, and simply use dialogue options to ask questions. All of these actions add a hugely deep and mixed background for the in-game galaxy, with complex interactions and repercussions of past actions echoed in the game you get to play, although possibly misunderstood or simply missed if the player choses to ignore them. If the interactions themselves didn't satisfy, the game has a 'codex', which is basically an encyclopedia which fills as you play and interact, meaning that if at any point you forget something you've picked up or simply want to learn more about an aspect of the game (with a large scope, from biology and cuture of alien races, to the weapons and armour used on the Normandy) you can delve into the codex and gain a better understanding. The storyline is believable, and multiple storylines can be followed through the use of paragon (hero) or renegade (badass) options. This allows for much greater depth and character development, and continues with your choices in the first game bridging over into the sequels. The paragon/renegade choice also shapes the way you interact with individual characters, bringing different methods of conflict resolution, persuading your way through tough situations, or even romance with the choice being left to the player. Character interactions are usually emotionally charged without being unreal, and these emotions build as you become closer to your crew, leading to some very hard decisions in the late game.\nOverall, this is one of my most favourite games I've ever played since I started on a Windows 95 at the age of 2. I fell in love on my first playthrough, and it definitely brings an amazing sense of gravitas with it. The game is deep, moving, and most importantly believable. Grapics, audio, and gameplay elements tie the whole package together in a beautiful way, and pull the player in deeper. I'd easilly give this a 9/10, and would recomend this to anyone with even a slight love of RPG. Simply put, buy this game, play it, and cherish it.","March 29, 2014","true","36.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

One minute, your ♥♥♥♥ is starting to tremble from the adrenaline that you feel as you're slaughtering dozens of unarmed colonists, the next you're getting rammed by a Krogan warlord. And nothing quite prepares you for the initial feeling of going balls deep in an Asari scientist, as you pull on her ♥♥♥♥♥♥ little tentacles. And lemme tell ya, this octopus doesn't trim her garden (Geddit?! Pubic hair comments with Beatles references!) However, the most powerful experience this game gives the player is the possibility to take advantage of an Easter egg in which you can anally probe a Geth, which shows how hard the developers worked to hold true to their sci-fi roots. Remember when that movie "AI. Artificial Intelligence" with Jude Law came out back in 2001, and everyone wanted to bang the brains out of Haley Joel Osment's character? It's kinda like that, but without the pedo vibe. All in all, I give Mass Effect 11 ♥♥♥♥♥♥ tentacles out of 5.

If you are a sucker for any of the following: spaceships, aliens, storytelling, RPGs, shooters, or sci-fi in general, and haven't yet played Mass Effect... well, what are you waiting for?!? Even though it's a few years old now and has a few minor problems, Mass Effect is still well-worth playing, especially if you have any interest at all in the upcoming ME3. I thought overall it was a really fun game, especially the story aspects. The shooting mechanics are also perfectly fine. The only major gripe I had was the weapon/inventory system. Throughout your journey, you are constantly finding tons of weapons and upgrades, 99% of which are duplicates or unneccessary. The interface for managing weapons is also confusing and cumbersome. But that one thing aside, I pretty much loved everything else about ME1.

The richness and depth of the Mass Effect Series' universe is easily on par with Star Wars and Star Trek. If you are a Sci-Fi Fan you can not help but get sucked in and swallowed whole by this beast.\n\nAs a game the strength of Mass Effect besides it's lore is a superb story within that lore, believable Charaters to interact with, choices over choices that impact not only the current game but reach forward into part 3 and some of the best written and performed dialog of all time.\n\nWithin the series this is the game featuring the most Exploration opportunities and the strongest classical RPG elements (VERY stat and skill dependant down to a limit in inventory space, lots of loot).\n\nThe weak points:\n\nBugs. It's a problem with the whole series. There is nothing gamebreaking, but some Bugs are just plain out annoying and stupid but never got fixed. My guess is that this is in no small part due to the fact that the Mass Effect games are made for consoles first and foremost and are from a console era when patching wasn't really an option.\n\nWhile the Exploration possibilities are quite big it sadly isn't done very well. Most of it consists of driving a vehicle with crazy physics through randomly generated height maps that had a few prefabs placed in them. That is litterally something that a hobbyist just learning how to make maps can put together in an hours work or less.\n\nThe list of weak points could be made longer.\n\nBut in reality they do not matter. Because the story and how it is presented not only makes up for the weak points. It lets you forget them. I am just in the middle of another series playthrough just because I have finally gotten all DLCs for part 3. And this probably is the strongest pro going for the series: Even though you could play just part 3. When you pick it up again you wanna start at the beginning again. With Part 1. Because seeing a new Shepard evolve and change over the course of three games is just awesome. It is just like those Lord of the Ring or Star Wars weekends when you watch all the movies in succession. Only better because it lasts for weeks. Hell a 100% completion playthrough of all three games is worth easily 150 hours of playtime.\n\nLast but not Least: Another important reason to get the Mass Effect Series is that part 4 is rumored to hit us next year at the latest and you absolutely will want to know what all the fuss is about when that happens.","April 22, 2015","true","196.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's been nearly 8 years since the initial launch of Bioware's Space Epic and to this day the industry is still learning from it. Mass Effect 2 brought serious improvements to the ME universe however the original Mass Effect is a classic. The Morality system where a player could either become a Paragon (Good) or a Renegade (Bad) was similar to the likes of the Good and Evil system of games like Fable however it actually awarded the player with satisfaction. Every decision point actually effected how you played the game.\n\nThe planet exploration system in Mass Effect has and always will be amazing, roaming planets with the Mako Rover was fun but awkward at times due to the mechanics however this was improved vastly in Mass Effect 2. When using the Mass Relay system to teleport from one relay to another you would get a decent animation that was followed by a stunning central planet followed by it's surrounding plants. The galaxy's that filled the space in between were stunning as well, with a high fidelity of stars and more it was a sight for the eyes that I have not forgotten to this day.\n\nActual combat was fairly decent however again it was vastly improved in Mass Effect 2. If you ever need a great game or series to play, something you plan to put at least a hundred plus hours into, the Mass Effect trilogy is a great choice however I suggest you prepare yourself for the ending of Mass Effect 3, don't say I didn't warn you about that one. If this game's on sale for $4.99 or even $19.99 BUY IT and the other two Mass Effect games as well (Mass Effect 3 is only available on Origin sadly, thanks EA).","December 16, 2014","true","7.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

If using 3D Vision, use Helix Mod.\nMajor Theme: How to define "original" Bioware games.\nBought at Price: $35 (for Mass Effect 1 and Mass Effect 2 Deluxe)\n\nOnly a few games fit into the "must play" listing I keep. If you have any dreams or hopes in playing the other Mass Effect games, start here. You will thank me later!\n\nBioware is the company to know for RPG titles. The lead writer (and then co-lead writer for Mass Effect 2) ensures you have a story filled with action and content. If you ever played Knights of the Old Republic (KotOR) I or II you will feel right at home. While feeling like KotOR in some ways, Mass Effect is a more "mature" version of it. You should be willing to deal with (and enjoy) the extra sex, gore, and innuendo that this title brings. Stories really need to have sex, gore, and humour to make them balanced, and that's what Mass Effect's plot brings.\n\nUsing the Unreal Engine from 2007, graphics are decent and shouldn't have issues running on most systems. If you have a control panel for your graphics card, you can try to force better options. That being said, there's a hidden frame rate smoothing option (60 fps), when disabled, can allow any high refresh rate monitor to shine. This can also help 3D vision players.\n\nGame is rated 3D vision "excellent", only real issue being that enemy icons seem 2D. This can be resolved, and overall stereoscopic 3D performance increased, by using Helix Mod. Really, Helix makes Mass Effect a treat to play with and will greatly improve immersion.\n\nIt should be assumed that you do not stop with Mass Effect. There's 2 more games to explore and enjoy in the series (besides the comics, books and such). This really just sets up the plot for the rest of the series. The biggest thing that the series should be known for is it's save porting, where you are able to plug the results of a previous title into the next and change the plot.\n\nThe "romance mechanic" is simple, as noted in my Mass Effect 2 review. This has lead to the Mass Effect romance system being called a "getting laid simulator". Don't be expecting to see the same mechanic from Dragon Age: Origins here. You can see my review on that title as well, if you wish for a better explanation.\n\nReading other bonus content, the biggest thing you will feel in the game is that there's still hidden old school RPG mechanics in play. While you think you are shooting a target, your shots can in fact miss. Another will be the inventory system, where you can only hold so many items. If you do not manage your inventory, you will be forced to either ditch items, or modify the hidden limit value. Just be aware this title hasn't fully transitioned out of those older mechanics.\n\nWhile not in the special elite class of 90+ on the metascore, still worthwhile. I'm sick of seeing COD like games, reskined platform runners, and super simple games. I've played enough out of my Valve titles, so this game was a breath of fresh air and worked out well.","June 29, 2014","true","65.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It has lots of twists, turns, and reveals that are pretty good. Not mind blowing, but still, its one of the highlights of the game. Theres alot there if you want to dig giving players a choice in how far they want to go into the lore of the worle.\n-Interactions with your squad members are memorable and personal. Each has distinct personalities and underlying motives that are there if you spend the time to get to know them all\n-The branching diolauge paths are great. Give some depth and a player's touch into the game. Not super deep and many diolauges still lead to the exact same result but thats ok.\n-The settings were pretty good. It was really neat to go explore all these planets and choose in what order you were to do it in. The aliens and universe created here are also interesting and thought out.\n-Runs well on my crap PC and also has a widespread texture mod for those who seek higher fidelity.\n\nCons\n-Elevators. There are alot of them. Most I assume are disgusing loading screens and it really gets old fast especially when in some situations you go through one elevator, get out, walk a bit, then go up another.\n-Combat. While it is good I wouldnt call it great. I played on the hardest difficulty with AI actions turned off for my squad mates and one of two things would happen in combat situations: my main character could just wipe out all the enemies without the help of my squadmates so I have no reason to even have them do anything, or when I do need them they are HORRIBLE at staying alive. Even when you direct them towards cover they very often come out for no reason and die. Somtimes you plan a combo of abilities on a enemy all at once but one squad member decides that its just not happening today. It got annoying. Also I didnt like that you had to pick your squadmates from the begining of the mission when you have no idea whats in store. They all have different abilities but only a few combos cover everything so it locks you out of doing certain combos of characters you may like. Overall it is an ok combat system, that with some tweaks could be really really good.\n-Driving sections - controls are kind of slippery and every driving section all game has the same 3 or 4 enemies making them really easy and really boring\n-Enemies. There are only about 10 enemys in the whole game if you dont count reskins. Kind of a a let down.\n-Final Boss- Ended up just being the main bad guy with the abilities of one of the enemy types you have fought all game with a stupid amount of health and rocket launchers added on. I get that the combat doesnt really lend itself to grandiose boss battles but still. Boss battles in general were usually just waves of common enemies.\n-Save points, This is the grandaddy of my annoyances with this game. Probably 5-10 times thoughout the main game you will have boss battles or very difficult encounters that have loooong cutscenes or elevators right before them. These cannot be skipped and its awful. Every time you die you have to walk through the same diolauge for 2 minutes before you fight. It gets old really fast espeicailly if you are having a real tough time with the boss. I get not skipping on the first time but there is no reason you shouldnt be able to skip on subsequent viewings.\n\nOverall I did really enjoy this game. This is a game that is greater than the sum of its parts. It keep me wanting to play to figure out what would happen next which cant be said for too many games I play. If you like a good space story and third person tactical shooters, I would grab this game. 7.5/10","January 1","true","12.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This game is a great start to this three part space opera. The story is deceptively simple. You are Commander Shephard and you must save the galaxy. As you complete the simple story you will have to make decisions that will flesh out the story and in some ways decide on who lives and who dies. Apart from the main story, there are numerous side missions that help develop relationships with fellow characters or influence what happens in the sequels. There is tons of replay value due to the fact that there are different ways to handle various situations in the game. The graphics have aged well, I think. The characters are all memorable. You won't like these characters, you will LOVE them. The relationships you build (or tear down) will follow you in the games to come. Now for the negatives, and I had to squint to see them. I personally found the exploration tedious. The planets you go to are all very detailed, with descriptions about their resources and history, but driving the vehicle to go through some of the rough terrain got to be annoying at times. Thats really the only negative I could think of. A great game that should be tried by everybody.","July 13, 2012","true","195.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The conversations and cinematics wind up taking up, quite literally, most of your time--except of course the endless backtracking on the Normandy and Mako portions--and making the game feel more like a visual novel than a Western action-RPG at times. It feels more like a story and less like a game, some of the time. Most of the time, really.\n\nThe RPG leveling is good, but nowhere near as good as, say, Skyrim's, or the original Deus Ex's. (I say the original because I have yet to play Human Revolution, not because I object to it in any way.) The levels you wind up focusing on are Charm and Intimidate, whose primary impact involves, you guessed it, the cinematic conversations. There's the electronics and decryption skill trees, sure (although they're more just lines than trees--for a game centered around choice-based narrative, there's not much choice-based gameplay) which allow you to access increasingly more advanced resources, but if you just bring one of your three tech-savvy squadmates and fully spec them to those trees, you can deal with any of those unlicks from about three hours in, which kind of renders the piont moot. That's good, though, because the alternative is yet more Mako scenes as you backtrack to planets you've already seen once you can access the resources on them.\n\nThe shooter portion, which is the part you actually play, has fewer concrete issues. You point and shoot. It's just lackluster. The sniper rifles are unsteady in a rather blatant nod to Deus Ex--they get better as you level them. Pistols are pretty much slightly slower assault rifles. Shotguns are bizzarely effective over long ranges. Assault Rifles, which only Soldier-class characters can train, are actually quite viable for non-soldier characters, to the point where on higher difficulties the game is almost impossible if you  forget about them.\n\nThe biggest issues I have are with certain enemies and level design. The Geth units which jump around the area are almost impossible to hit, especially if you haven't got a controller mod installed. There is the occasional open level where sniper rifles are viable, but a lot of the game is played at close-quarters to the enemy, which renders snipers useless. Annoying, since I like the Infiltrator class's tech abilities combines with combat proficiency, since biotics are very hard to use in this first game.\n\nBut in spite of all that, Mass Effect works, mechanically speaking. Nothing is broken. I wouldn't come back to it for the gameplay, but it's not painful to play--unless you're in the Mako and trying to 100% every planet, in which case, you have my sympathies.\n\nWhere Mass Effect--and Bioware in general--shine is in narrative. Mass Effect--the first game, not the trilogy--does a fantastic job of creating a setting and telling a story in it. It's a bit bland compared to its two sequels, I'll be honest. It doesn't have the thematic subtext those games do. Mass Effect 1 is nothing more than it claims to be: a story which provides you a template--Shepard--and lets you play with him or her how you choose. But that much it does incredibly well.\n\nThere are few scenes in a video game that have aged as well as the first meeting with Sovereign on Virmire or the conversation with Vigil on Ilos. Despite the ridiculous texture glitch on Garrus' face, we start to get a real feel for one of the best characters in gaming in this game, and he is fun, especially when in an elevator with Tali or Wrex so they can yell at each other.\n\nThe less said about elevators, the better, of course.\n\nThe romances are a bit dull, I will admit. Your choices are Kaidan, Ashley, and Liara. Kaidan is bland, Ashley is xenophobic, and Liara never uses contractions because at this point Bioware still thought that was a cool way to make a character mysterious. I guess Liara's the best choice, but it's a bit like deciding which cheap shoe looks least cheap.\n\nWow, I'm really bashing the game aren't I? Yeah, it's flawed. Really flawed. But it works. The first playthrough can be incredibly immersive. Saren is a great villain, most of the time, and a good one overall. Sovereign is truly chilling. You feel like something is at stake, by the end of the game, although it never quite reaches the emotional peaks at the last levels of Mass Effect 2 and 3.\n\nAll in all, it's not a masterpiece, but it's a fun game, and one well worth a purchase, even when it's not on sale. When it is on sale, you'd be a fool not to get it.","December 24, 2014","true","128.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

The game offers you a rich scenario, with plenty of things to do. The game mechanics are a bit unconfortable, but it gets fun once you get used to it. Soundtrack is beautiful and well suited, the plot is very well designed, involving and fun to uncover. The graphics are old, but they are good enough. Characteres are the main strength of the game I think: very complex personalities, many possible interactions and dialogue outcomes. You will never few like you are talking to the same NPC, regardeless if he is a shopper, guard, squad member or quest-NPC. They are so well design you can few pity or foundness for some of them.\n\nThe game have weaknesses , I can say that for one thing, money is useless. Yes, you can buy some interesting upgrades and weapons/armors with it. But it is definitely not a must, you can go just fine with the loots you find in mission. The few upgrades you can't find in mission (like extra medi-gel capacity for instance) are so cheap it doesen't really few you are spending anything. Speaking of upgrades, those are another weak spot of the game. Too many of those and they don't look so different. When you less expect you will be carrying too many of those and not knowing good combinations. I also expected some spaceship warefare...but the game has none. The character role I picked has also some kind of a problem. As an infiltrator, the best combat strategy I have has to sniper-shoot everyone...and cry if an enemy get to close, since I don't have any other effective trained weapon to use. One would expect some sort of clock ability - they fixed that in ME 2, fortunately.\n\nBut those are minor weaknesses. I would score the game 4 out of 5.","March 9, 2014","true","27.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I didn't realize how much better the first game is ME2 and ME3, until i started replaying ME1 the other day. Grand nostalgia started kicking in and the epicness of this game is on a scale unmatched by any other space game. The level-up system is fleshed out, the characters are fleshed out, decisions have big impacts and the combat is tactical, difficult and awesome. Also, the inventory I happen to like quite a bit, when most people hate it. But thanks to so many people hating it, BioWare completely got rid of it and stripped the game of it's other most important RPG elements for ME2 and ME3.\n\nMass Effect 1 is to ME2 and ME3 what Dragon Age Origins is to Dragon Age 2. The first game of both series' were epic beyond the likes of any other game in it's genre and had so much content it kept you wide-eyed and fully entrapped by it's charm. While the sequels were just stripped down of the best features they once had. Though I have to say that ME2 is still a pretty entertaining and fun game, but didn't do justice to the original.\n\nTo say the least, if you enjoy space games or RPGs, then this game is a must and you'll probably love it. Admittedly it does take a few hours to really get into the game and the tactical combat takes some getting used to, but it's great fun once you learn. That's all good in my opinion. I enjoy having to learn a  game rather than being thrown into it and it being the same as every other game in it's genre. This game will take you on one of the most memorable journeys you've ever been on in gaming and it will captivate you the entire way through, from the grand music, to the tactical combat, to the storytelling, etc.\n\nOn a side not, a lot of people also didn't like exploring planets with the Mako, but I think that's one of the best parts. It's fun discovering materials/items and uncovering the secrets of some planets and completing quests on others.

I didn't quite remember all the details from ME3, which was good, but I knew enough about the Mass Effect world to where I wasn't completely lost. With that said, finally figuring out all the backstory and references made in ME3 was amazing.\n\nStory-wise, the Mass Effect universe is on par with Star Wars and Star Trek. The charaters are developed extremely well, with well thought out insight in each different species. The dialogue and choices are superb. At the end of the day, when you finally save and exit the game, you feel as if you were part of the action. Part of Commander Shepard's odyssey. Going back to reality was always a bummer.\n\nCombat-wise the controls were a little loose. Then again, this game is about 7 years old at this point. You get use to the controls, but do not expect very responsive actions and features that most games have today. Most of the side quests (assignments) felt like chores at the end, but I still wanted to get them all done to explore the awesome ME universe. Customization is also not as well-developed as the sequels are. Many times I get stuck with a Shepard wearing a ridiculous looking armour but the stats on it are amazing so I couldn't argue. The decision making (Paragon/Renegade) also provides unique story, meticulous and sometimes stressful choices, and good replayability, even if much of the story is progressively linear.\n\nIn the end, I can understand why Mass Effect is so popular. The universe draws you in and the gripping story, dialogue, and action make you want to play this game until you have played it 3+ times, exhausting all the different dialogue choices, actions, and play styles you can make in the game. Worth the money. Worth the time. You will regret nothing besides some of the grueling choices you have to make along the way to save the galaxy.

I really enjoyed the story, and the way it progressed really impressed me. The supporting cast aren't that great (something they improved in Mass Effect 2, sadly with the loss of the great story) but the fact that Shepard develops how you want him to while still remaining an interesting character is no mean feat.\n\nIt is quite annoying that some conversations that give you options just ignore your choices and just go straight into what the game wants, and I guess it would be tough to make a game which allowed all that but then making games is tough. So I would've liked more freedom to do what I wanted rather than just what the game dictated. Nobody likes a game pretending you have a choice and then just ignoring it. That's just not cool.\n\nThe combat is perfectly acceptable. I heartily recommend going with the combat-biotic fusion character as then you get the most fun out of your character while still remaining a heavy hitter with weapons. The squad-part of combat is really not at all important, as your squad is not all that effective and they can just about handle themselves. I'm quite glad that they did that though, as I prefer having a squad that does their own thing. They could have made them slightly more clever however.\n\nOverall, a very good game with a few drawbacks.

The characters in this game are so well developed, the grow on you to the point you'll always consider them life long friends. This is an action RPG and the game lives up to that classification. The action is just as riveting as the decisions you'll need to make over the course of the game.

The most notable achievement perhaps is the rich storyline and detailed universe created by the developers (there is plenty to read here -- I started by reading every word but confess to scanning some texts as the game progressed). The graphics are good in parts but not in others (I know this game came out in 2007 but then so did Crysis). The voice acting is overall pretty good and there are plenty of branches to the dialogue trees. And this is where MASS EFFECT’s strengths lie: in the role playing aspects of the game. You’re given the opportunity to be the good guy or the not so good guy, depending on how you wish to play. Less successful is the combat, which, for the most part, failed to engage. Also the side missions are very repetitive and dull. The vehicle you get to drive on numerous occasions bounces around like a drunken bouncy thing, and there are endless elevators that take too long to ascend or descend. Oh, and the UI for selecting skills, weapons etc. is needlessly complex.\nOverall MASS EFFECT is worth playing but the whole experience is oddly detached and vaguely unsatisfying.

The strength of Mass Effect lies in its narrative that is supplemented by the in-game Codex which painstakingly lays out the future history of Earth, technology and the various alien races. The gameplay involves simple shoot ‘n cover tactics followed by lengthy sessions of exploration and character dialogue. Compared to its sequel and other RPGs, Mass Effect can become a bit tedious when you choose to explore the various planets and again so when it comes to upgrading and managing your equipment. However, these mishaps are easily overshadowed by the game’s plot that will leave sci-fi & RPG fans craving for more of the universe.

Yes, you can buy some interesting upgrades and weapons/armors with it. But it is definitely not a must, you can go just fine with the loots you find in mission. The few upgrades you can't find in mission (like extra medi-gel capacity for instance) are so cheap it doesen't really few you are spending anything. Speaking of upgrades, those are another weak spot of the game. Too many of those and they don't look so different. When you less expect you will be carrying too many of those and not knowing good combinations. I also expected some spaceship warefare...but the game has none. The character role I picked has also some kind of a problem. As an infiltrator, the best combat strategy I have has to sniper-shoot everyone...and cry if an enemy get to close, since I don't have any other effective trained weapon to use. One would expect some sort of clock ability - they fixed that in ME 2, fortunately.\n\nBut those are minor weaknesses.

It gives a chance to make the character your own, with options that make you observe what you want to say, instead of having an idea of what will be 'good guy' or 'badass'. The universe offers a lot of reward for exploring and enterprise, making the game far longer than the set story.\n\nThere are shortcomings obviously. The combat has slight hard-spots but its largely cooperative. Sometimes its worth saving before dialogue just to make sure you don't pick an option that you later find 'misleading'. Lastly, new OS's don't always get along with the game.

The supporting cast aren't that great (something they improved in Mass Effect 2, sadly with the loss of the great story) but the fact that Shepard develops how you want him to while still remaining an interesting character is no mean feat.\n\nIt is quite annoying that some conversations that give you options just ignore your choices and just go straight into what the game wants, and I guess it would be tough to make a game which allowed all that but then making games is tough. So I would've liked more freedom to do what I wanted rather than just what the game dictated. Nobody likes a game pretending you have a choice and then just ignoring it. That's just not cool.\n\nThe combat is perfectly acceptable. I heartily recommend going with the combat-biotic fusion character as then you get the most fun out of your character while still remaining a heavy hitter with weapons. The squad-part of combat is really not at all important, as your squad is not all that effective and they can just about handle themselves. I'm quite glad that they did that though, as I prefer having a squad that does their own thing. They could have made them slightly more clever however.\n\nOverall, a very good game with a few drawbacks. Not a brilliant game, but a very good game nonetheless.","December 16, 2013","true","33.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game is incredible. I played this game close to 7 years after its release and it's still amazing. This game is perfect. The story is absolutely engrossing and something you can submerge yourself into, it's like a modern day Star Wars. The characters in this game are so well developed, the grow on you to the point you'll always consider them life long friends. This is an action RPG and the game lives up to that classification. The action is just as riveting as the decisions you'll need to make over the course of the game. Never before has a game put me on the edge of my seat, regarding the consequences of choices I've made. I love the freedom this game offers. The tension builds and builds as you reach the climax. The game play is intuitive and an enjoyable experience. As you build your characters skillsets, you experience such a natural incline of abilites and you can lots of options to build a character with combat skills suited to your preferences. This is game you'll remember.\n\nInterested in Mass Effect 2 or 3? Not sure if you'll enjoy Mass Effect because it's almost a decade old? Buy this game, you will not be dissapointed. Not only will it enrich your experience for Mass Effect 2 and 3, it's just downright a great game. You'll soon realize the more Mass Effect in your life, the better.\n\nHell, I even suffered through playing Mass Effect 3 on origin....that's how great this game is!","January 31, 2014","true","26.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The most notable achievement perhaps is the rich storyline and detailed universe created by the developers (there is plenty to read here -- I started by reading every word but confess to scanning some texts as the game progressed). The graphics are good in parts but not in others (I know this game came out in 2007 but then so did Crysis). The voice acting is overall pretty good and there are plenty of branches to the dialogue trees. And this is where MASS EFFECT’s strengths lie: in the role playing aspects of the game. You’re given the opportunity to be the good guy or the not so good guy, depending on how you wish to play. Less successful is the combat, which, for the most part, failed to engage. Also the side missions are very repetitive and dull. The vehicle you get to drive on numerous occasions bounces around like a drunken bouncy thing, and there are endless elevators that take too long to ascend or descend. Oh, and the UI for selecting skills, weapons etc. is needlessly complex.\nOverall MASS EFFECT is worth playing but the whole experience is oddly detached and vaguely unsatisfying. I have MASS EFFECT 2 also. I understand it’s much improved on the first.\n\n3/5","December 1, 2013","true","29.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You can get cryo ammo to freeze your enemy, or biotic power that allow you to through your enemies.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Masterchiefs/recommended/17460/","Masterchiefs","Belegarssøn #ianmcshanerocks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Masterchiefs/","951 products in account","I actually spent 20 hours in this game in the last 4 days in Steam offline mode, so ignore Steam playtime.\n\nMass Effect was a pleasant surprise for me, because of two reasons: I'm not a fan of space opera and sci-fi, and I couldn't get into one of Bioware's well known title - Dragon Age: Origins. But screw them, let's talk about Mass Effect. The game has messy inventory system, clunky animations, pretty straightforward weapon upgrades and doesn't allow progressing after finishing the main story, aaaaaaand... that's it, that's all my criticism for ME. What can I say more about it? Mass Effect is a well-crafted game from head to toe, with nearly all aspects perfected.\n\nFirst, I freaking love the narrative. In the first 30 minutes, I thought it was some typical pretentious sci-fi piece of ♥♥♥♥ that overcomplicates everything, but nope, the story really hooked me in, even it was just a standard good-vs-evil story filled with cliches. I can't tell exactly what I love about ME's story, but it gave me a sense of real progression, and pushed me forward through each events in the game. Sometime intense, sometime emotional and sometime even silly (especially in romance subplots), and of course it doesn't lack "epicness" for a sci-fi saga.\n\nNext, the dialogues. There's no such thing as illusive choices. In ME, every choice matters, and not all decisions lead to a good end.  I still feel bad because I accidentally shot Wrax on Virmire, had to replay that section. Tip: Spend your points in Charisma or Intimidate, they're very important, don't ignore them.\n\nTeammates. Uhuh, this is not your standard companions, your squad mates are TRUE human (or alien) beings with their own unique personality. You know what? I found it more interesting to wandering around the Normandy, talking to my squad mates, rather than exploring the galaxy. And I've never, ever, felt so much difficult in deciding between 2 squad mates' fates. There was no game that made me care so much about my team mates like Mass Effect. Why? Because ♥♥♥♥ you Bioware, you created some of the most memorable and well-developed side characters in any game I've ever played. If I don't see Garrus, Wrex, Liara or Tali in the sequels, many tables will be flipped.\n\nGunplay hasn't aged well, but it's certainly enjoyable. Tons of weapons, upgrades and special biotic abilities. You don't need to be a strategist to play the game, but it certainly helps if you can order your squad mates to assist you on the battlefield.\n\nAargh. why, why did I spend the last 7 years without giving a damn about Mass Effect? Why didn't I know about it sooner? Why did I pass on this masterpiece? And why does Garrus's face look low-textured? Anyway, Mass Effect, 10 ♥♥♥♥ing out of 10, heavily recommended. If you are a fan of RPG or sci-fi, play it already. If you don't give a crap about RPG or sci-fi, then still give it a try, because you might like it as much as I do.","February 19, 2015","true","3.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","3"

Each class comes with its own unique set of advantages and disadvantages. Certain classes can only use certain types of weapons and abilities.  The game also gives you the option of solving missions by being good(paragon) or a bit more ruthless (renegade) Depending on your choice, leads to more dialogue options in the future.\n\n+Combat is a huge part of the game. Each gun type feels good, along with the different abilities. You can issue commands to your party members however for the most part they do fine if you leave them be.  Certain battles can be very engaging requiring you to make full use of the environments and equipment.\n\n+The overall plot is excellent and keeps the game interesting. Although it touches upon a lot of different sci fi tropes the game presents all of these ideas in a manner that makes the game interesting and fun to play\n\n+ The writing/dialogue and the voice acting are all fantastic making every interaction engaging to listen to.\n\n+In typical Bioware fashion, the companions and villains are interesting and for the most part, the best characters in the game. Talking to each companion and listening to their history adds a level of depth to the game.\n\n+Character design is excellent, each race has a unique look and feel to them adding to the believability.\n\n+ The main missions are varied and fun to play, each mission involves driving a vehicle which helps break up the shooting segments and keeps things from getting stale.\n\n+The lead up to the final confrontation and ultimately the conclusion is epic. It really feels satisfying, and is a fitting end to the game. I would argue this game has a better build up to the end than the other games in the series.\n\n+The overall scope of this game is impressive for what its trying to accomplish. The game has a variety of different planets to explore in your vehicle, side missions, story missions, talking to your companions, learning the history of the different races, planets, technologies etc. If you are a gamer who loves being absorbed into a universe Bioware did a fantastic job of detailing every possible aspect of the game.\n\n+Graphically the game still holds up very well, though textures seem blurry.\n\n+ Music and sound\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- The user interface is abysmal for what this game is trying to accomplish. Buying/Selling or even equipping items in your inventory seems much harder than it needs to be. The UI does not convey information in a presentable fashion. There are options missing that would makes things so much easier, i.e organizing  inventory lists based on damage/accuracy etc.\n\n-Side missions are incredibly repetitive for all the wrong reasons. The game recycles three or 4 level designs over and over again taking the fun out of playing these missions. In addition most side quest missions are completed the same way- Kill lots of enemies, reach the end of the level, talk to somebody and resolve it by being good or bad. If you played one of them, you pretty much played them all.\n\n-The idea of exploring different planets, discovering lost ruins, and missions certainly sounds awesome but something was lost in the execution. Going down to a planet is amazing the first time but quickly wears off its appeal the third, fourth or fifth time. Every planet although very different in look and feel, plays out all the same. Driving around in barren landscapes is only fun for so long. This is the only way to get and complete side quests.\n\n-Bugs, glitches are present. I got stuck in a wall more than a few occasions.\n\n-No official controller support. I know mods exists to correct this issue but it is not fully implemented. You can't properly use the controller in menus nor can you use it when issuing commands to your party members.\n\nConclusion\nThere is plenty to love with this game and I certainly loved my time with it, however the glaring flaws holds it back from what should be a true classic.\n","September 22, 2014","true","25.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

This particular game is the first in the trilogy(obviously) and in many ways what got me into the rpg-genre of gaming. I wasn't a fan of this genre beforehand and for me to get my hands on this game was actually a happy mistake. I got to randomly try out the demo and have never looked back since. The greatest strengts of this game is its grand, epic and interesting story, both ingame and lorewise. Bioware(developer) is also known to craft some of the finest characters/companions around, which makes the whole experience that more awesome. You care about them and want to get to know them better for their great diversity, flaws or stengths. Some of the gameplay may be a bit rusty (It came out in 2007) but if you're in for the story and lore you will not get dissapointed. The sequels will greatly expand on the gameplay, as will your choices. Remember, the Mass Effect saga is currently over 3 games and choices made in the first game will haunt you in the second or third installment.","October 26, 2013","true",""," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Each class comes with its own unique set of advantages and disadvantages. Certain classes can only use certain types of weapons and abilities.  The game also gives you the option of solving missions by being good(paragon) or a bit more ruthless (renegade) Depending on your choice, leads to more dialogue options in the future.\n\n+Combat is a huge part of the game. Each gun type feels good, along with the different abilities. You can issue commands to your party members however for the most part they do fine if you leave them be.  Certain battles can be very engaging requiring you to make full use of the environments and equipment.\n\n+The overall plot is excellent and keeps the game interesting. Although it touches upon a lot of different sci fi tropes the game presents all of these ideas in a manner that makes the game interesting and fun to play\n\n+ The writing/dialogue and the voice acting are all fantastic making every interaction engaging to listen to.\n\n+In typical Bioware fashion, the companions and villains are interesting and for the most part, the best characters in the game. Talking to each companion and listening to their history adds a level of depth to the game.\n\n+Character design is excellent, each race has a unique look and feel to them adding to the believability.\n\n+ The main missions are varied and fun to play, each mission involves driving a vehicle which helps break up the shooting segments and keeps things from getting stale.\n\n+The lead up to the final confrontation and ultimately the conclusion is epic. It really feels satisfying, and is a fitting end to the game. I would argue this game has a better build up to the end than the other games in the series.\n\n+The overall scope of this game is impressive for what its trying to accomplish. The game has a variety of different planets to explore in your vehicle, side missions, story missions, talking to your companions, learning the history of the different races, planets, technologies etc. If you are a gamer who loves being absorbed into a universe Bioware did a fantastic job of detailing every possible aspect of the game.\n\n+Graphically the game still holds up very well, though textures seem blurry.\n\n+ Music and sound\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- The user interface is abysmal for what this game is trying to accomplish. Buying/Selling or even equipping items in your inventory seems much harder than it needs to be. The UI does not convey information in a presentable fashion. There are options missing that would makes things so much easier, i.e organizing  inventory lists based on damage/accuracy etc.\n\n-Side missions are incredibly repetitive for all the wrong reasons. The game recycles three or 4 level designs over and over again taking the fun out of playing these missions. In addition most side quest missions are completed the same way- Kill lots of enemies, reach the end of the level, talk to somebody and resolve it by being good or bad. If you played one of them, you pretty much played them all.\n\n-The idea of exploring different planets, discovering lost ruins, and missions certainly sounds awesome but something was lost in the execution. Going down to a planet is amazing the first time but quickly wears off its appeal the third, fourth or fifth time. Every planet although very different in look and feel, plays out all the same. Driving around in barren landscapes is only fun for so long. This is the only way to get and complete side quests.\n\n-Bugs, glitches are present. I got stuck in a wall more than a few occasions.\n\n-No official controller support. I know mods exists to correct this issue but it is not fully implemented. You can't properly use the controller in menus nor can you use it when issuing commands to your party members.\n\nConclusion\nThere is plenty to love with this game and I certainly loved my time with it, however the glaring flaws holds it back from what should be a true classic.\n","September 22, 2014","true","25.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

This game is extremely fun all around, though exploration and interaction with the various extraterrestrial races is perhaps the high point of the entire game. I'm of the opinion that this game would have worked as a standalone title without the sequels that followed it, though the sequels are good in their own right.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aizawaa/recommended/17460/","Aizawaa","crowbAr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aizawaa/","342 products in account","rating: worth buying at full pricescore: 7.5/10 - good\nsimilar games: Deus Ex Human Revolution, Dragon Age Origins, Spec Ops The Line\ntags: RPG, character development, story-driven, relationships, dull gameplay\n\nI finally got the motivation to play Mass Effect. After so many years of praise for this franchise I just said to myself that I HAVE to at least play it for a fair amount of time. I tried playing this game some years ago but the extremely dull gameplay immediately turned me off and male Shephard isn't really interesting as a character. This playthrough I started as female Shephard (suggested by many people) and that really made the game more interesting, but before I talk about the good things I want to talk about the dull gameplay.\nI keep saying the word dull because that's the most fair way to describe it I think, because its not really "bad", but you have no decisions to do as a player, you don't have to use your brain, you just keep shooting. That does not mean that it cant be fun though, but for me it wasn't. Sometimes it was really annoying, sometimes it had its moments, sometimes is was just consuming my time. The game would really benefit if they would reduce the combat and focus on characters instead, but I guess you have to please the mass market. The problems with the combat are the following: Enemies are bullet sponges, sound design is bad, AI is terrible, you have no interesting abilities, only your squad has, and weapons are unsatisfying to use due to ugly recoil and bad hit feedback. Its not terrible, considering the age of the game, but it really drags the game down.\nAnother bad thing are the side-missions which are nothing but filler, completely meaningless and a waste of time. Most of them are the same recycled levels with other objectives, but even the objectives themselves are just go from A to B, kill everything on your way and press the action button at the end. There were some side-missions where you interact with characters, but those are very rare and those interactions only go for a very short duration. I recommend skipping every side-mission, except the ones you do for your crew-members (not all of them have missions for you).\nThe main missions were really fun though, you get to an area which could be a planet, a station, something which works as a hub area. There you meet characters and things happen and you get like mini side-missions from some people which are okay since they don't take much time and the character interaction is what makes this game fun.\nWhat I like about the main missions is that you stay at one big hub area for a long time and have to do different objectives to achieve something and get to different places. That reminded me a lot of Deus Ex, and it works almost as good as in Deus Ex. Exploring these places and meeting characters from different races is interesting and fun. Only thing which breaks this a little bit are the extremely annoying elevators, which probably are just there to cover loading screens. The thing is if they would just put a loading screen there it would probably load in seconds, cause today we have better PCs, but this game was mainly developed for consoles, so they didn't think about that. Still there are some PC specific things, for example you have extra keys assigned to each weapon and keys assigned to things like inventory and journal.\nThe graphics are very dated, but character models still look fine, and overall the game still looks good thanks to very creative weapon and alien design. Animations are sometimes really bad, in most cutscenes the character are just standing in front of each other and moving their lips a little, but that's fine, because it still works. To the end of the game you can see that they put much more effort to the presentation and cutscenes and the story also gets really tense later, but expect a slow start and don't kill your motivation by doing filler side-missions. Also after every main missions you should talk to every squad member, you get interesting and fun dialouges and build relationships.\nI think this is a good game, but a little bit overhyped. People praise it for its story, for good reason, but forget the gameplay, or they just don't care about it, I do however. That's why I can't give it a very good score, but a 7.5 is still good in my book and definitely worth playing if you can handle dull gameplay.","May 12, 2015","true","17.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

It all started with this first installment which introduces us to an immersive open galaxy where the decisions we make through gameplay and dialogue options shape our journey along throughout our time in the game. You play as a Commander of your own ship and are tasked with bringing a rogue Spectre to justice.\n\nAlong the way you visit numerous planets and environments with a squad of team mates you recruit along the way. The character interactions between you and your squad truly shape your experience playing the game as you begin to learn about their backgrounds and understand their motivations for fighting alongside you.\n\nThe plot is straightforward with an engaging villain (the rogue Spectre Saren) and develpos at a steady pace with many more options for side quests that help build and shape the world building, or galaxy building I should say.  Playing as Commander Shepard you have the option to play nicely (paragon) or rather roughly (renegade) while dealing with your dialogue wheel options, allowing to to shape your character's personality. I personally prefer the paragon route.\n\nAny downsides I would mention are the somewhat clunky mechanics during fire fights and the difficulty there can sometimes be when you try and fail to take cover. The graphics have aged compared to the more recent installments but  can still be considered decent. I highly reccommend giving the Mass Effect game series a go. It will change your perception of sci-fi RPGs for the better, and not to mention there are two jaw-dropping sequels to sink your teeth into after this one.","December 20, 2015","true","56.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The characters and chemistry between you and character you meet are one of the things that makes Mass Effect so great. A truly brilliant RPG for those who love Science Fiction and action games.\n\nAs you can tell by the amount of time I've spent playing this game, I've done quite a few playthroughs (I've lost count of how many times I've played Mass Effect, but it's an abnormally large number). Bioware really has a knack of combining a great storyline and character development together with gameplay and customisation. Of course, this was before EA really got them by the balls and milked their franchise dry.\n\nFirst things first, here is what I LOVED about this game.\n- The story (as mentioned many times above) could not be any better;  immediately you're thrown into the story, as Commander Shepard, with the Alliance Navy, on your way to Eden Prime to check out some Prothean artifacts and screw up whatever plan the bad guys had going.  The different plot points blend together perfectly; the introduction of Saren Arterius, the Geth, the Citadel and your Spectre ranking, it all just comes and goes so well. The interaction with characters and potential romance options really puts the player in the game and the experiences really stick with you.\n- The lore/canon behind the different points of the game and the background to the game is brilliant; I've spent many hours external of the game reading up on the Mass Effect Wikia page about different planets, key events (like the discovery of the Mass Relay near Pluto) and the technology seen within the game. Players can learn everything and more about the Mass Effect universe without even leaving the game, the codex contains lots and lots of sub-sections pointing to various information about the universe, with the player being able to add more and more accessible canon stories to the codex by interacting with certain items or buildings in game.\n- Character customisation is really in-depth and customisable; right off the bat, you are given the choice to edit your character's name, appearance, classification and background story. The appearance customisation options are alright, it's pretty default across a lot of RPG games. The class system is great also, with different classes offering the player different weapon choices, in-game powers and abilities. By selecting a character's background story, it really allows you to set up your characters morals for whatever way you wish to play;  whether you want to be a badass Male/Female Shepard who doesn't ask questions and shoots first, or a negotiator, who can talk their way out of anything , you have those choices in Mass Effect.\n- In-game levelling up and point assignment to you and your squadmates works very well; you have lots of options to add points to specific abilites that will become more accurate, powerful or varied with you and your team in combat and in dialogue. You can also access all your squad's character profiles on the Normandy and customise each one individually, as well as assign different squadmates to you with different missions.\n- The variety of weapons and mods available is huge to say the least; you can modify any weapon to have different effects on enemies, have a fast fire rate or more accuracy to name a few, as well as purchase or loot newer, more powerful weapons and equip them to you and your squadmates. The same is said for armor and omni-tools, which too can be upgraded by newer items.\n\nNow, for the things I was not so much a fan of in Mass Effect.\n- Off the bat I'm going to appeal to any of you graphic predators; this game is not high-end, cutting edge in the graphics department, it's pretty meh for a game that came out in 2007, compare to the likes of Assassin's Creed or Crysis that came out the same year. But available mods can greatly improve in-game textures and such if it really bothers you.\n- In-game, the mechanics of combat and everything combat-related is not really that great; the whole cover system, FOV and freeze screen selection is alright, but the newer Mass Effect 2 and 3 definitely improve on this game's mechanics.\n- The exploration options in the game are pretty linear, but definitely better than Mass Effect 2 and 3. Every world just kind of looks the same but in different colours or with a few different bases re-arranged. The mako is also a pain in the ♥♥♥ to command around when exploring, getting stuck on mountain sides or in ditches and causing a lot of awkward situations.\n\nTo conclude my review of Mass Effect;  this game and it's counter-parts are my pride and joy of video games. The game overall is so well made and the elements of it just work together fantastically, and for   £7.99, I think it's worth every penny   (or wait until the Steam sales, where I've seen it sell for £1.99 many times).\nI highly recommend you invest in this game if you like RPGs, Science Fiction or want to play a game you'll get lost in over and over again, for hours on end.","January 5","true","154.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","3"

Absolutely incredible. A space-faring action RPG!\n\nI love the crap out of this game. The combat, the weapons, the skill tree, the story, everything. Fabulous. Well done, Bioware.\n\nThe story is enthralling, and you really feel like you're fighting to save the galaxy. The twists and turns are delicious and surprising.\n\nThe combat system is fantastic. Finally a run-and-gun style of game that doesn't require you to hunt around for tons of freaking ammo. Instead guns have limitless ammo, but you can't fire too much or they'll overheat and be useless for a short time. Really a great mechanic, I love it. Scrounging and searching for ammo while playing was always annoying and immersion breaking for me in other games.\n\nThe skill tree is great, very in-depth. You have a lot of choices to make and can make a unique character. I could play this game twenty times twenty different ways and STILL have different paths to take and different characters to create. Well done.\n\nThe voice acting is fantastic. Love it.\n\nOverall a wonderful game. 10/10","October 4, 2014","true","31.1"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lunaril/recommended/17460/","Lunaril","Lunaril","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lunaril/","880 products in account","Mass Effect is the first in a series of games where you play as Commander Shepard, the first first mate of the USS Normandy, who is given command of the Normandy after a devestating attack on the human colony of Eden Prime. Your mission is to investigate the alien race behind the attack and save the Galaxy. Without going into anymore detail, as I wouldn't want to ruin it for you. Mass Effect is one of my all time favorite video game series, as the story just draws you in. The characters give you some back story, and you can explore the homeworlds of several council races, as well as explore the galaxy in general with your ship. Choices you make effect the gameplay overall and can be carried from the First Mass Effect into 2 and 3.\n\nThe game is played in third-person mode, has a magnificent story and is visually pleasing to play. The only criticism I have for this does not come against the game itself, but against Steam for not having Mass Effect 3. Due to a deal Bioware made, Steam will never have the rights to Mass Effect 3, which means you won't be able to get the full experience of the series on Steam. With that aside, this game is worth playing if you are a fan of video games.","December 13, 2015","true","0.4"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

With titles like Bioshock and Super Mario Galaxy, it was undoubtedly a great year.  Mass Effect is one of those rare few games that truely capture what an RPG is all about.  Combining fantastic writing, visuals that still hold up to this day, a combat system that was so different yet worked so well, and a giant open world, you have one hell of a game.  RPG elements include skill leveling, tons of different kinds of weapons, abilities that all serve a purpose in the battlefield, and tons of side quests (some goofy, some awesome) that all seem to work so well.  The characters are colorful and the voice acting superb, especially Jennifer Hale's femshep voice.  But remember, humans are not the only species in the galaxy, and aliens play a big part in your adventure, some will help you and some will try to kill you, so its up to you to decide who should pal around at your side.\n\nOf course, with all great things, there are downsides.  The world, as vast as it is, can seem a bit empty at times, and the squad memeber AI can prove to be difficult.  There are a few glitches, but nothing gamebreaking and nothing severely awful.\n\nAll in all I reccomend this game to everyone, as it is one hell of a ride from beginning to end.  The truely unfortunate thing is that Mass Effect might have been BioWare's magnum opus, as the 2 sequels fell under the care of EA.

Well written and developing characters, epic story and massive amounts of lore, this is definetly my kind of game.\n\nThe combat was, at times, frustrating with my team mates getting in the way from time to time but the option to can organise the tactics of battle is available, if a little messy. In the end the combat was fun and it felt great to blast enemies away with the shotgun thanks to the level ssystemm that allowed me to upgrade any aspect of my Shepard that I wanted.\n\nThe strongest aspect of the game for me however, was the extensive dialogue and heavy story line. That's just me but if you don't enjoy cutscenes and/or plenty of talking then this is not for you. I do, so I created my FemShep and together we set off on an epic journey to distant planets with our alien team members. My FemShep also took a shine to a member of a certain mono-gendered species but who your Shepard takes an interest in is up to you~\n\nThe shere amount of side quests work well to expand the length of gameplay and without completeling them all, it took me 29 hours to fully finish the game.

It really feels like you are actively participating in a movie and the actions you take (or don't take) leave an a "flavorful" impact on the game's story. The game is worth the purchase of just experiencing the rich story.\n\nHowever, from a gameplay perspective there are some issues. First off all but 1 or 2 squadmates are completely useless, they don't seem to understand how shot blockers work and will just fire in a linear path to the target of choice. The game also relies heavily on quick saves and I suggest you use them because there are a lot of enemies and wepaons that will just flat-out 1 shot you with no warning. The areas you explore and visit, particularly for side quests become very repativie and re-used. You generally are performing the same type of mission but with different enemies or a different story behind why you are shooting things in the face, and a lot of the level designs are copy pasted from previous sides quests.\n\nAdditionally the "hacking" you do is fun for roughly the first 8 seconds, afterwards just spend omni-gel to unlock stuff.  If I were to compare this first game of a AAA series to another I would compare it to how I felt playing Assasins Creed. Both ME1 and AC1 suffer from similar issues, re-used level design, repetative mission (particularly side quests) and clunky controls. That being said both were fun to play and offered about 20-30 hours of solid, fun gameplay. If you have not played the Mass Effect series ME1 will not dissapoint you. Definitely an easy pickup during a sale and well worth your money.\n\n8/10\n+Strong Story\n+Great voice acting and characters\n-Repetative side-quests\n-Poor squad AI\n-Clunky Controls","August 3, 2014","true","31.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I really enjoy single-player RPGs in general, especially those with compelling story lines. Considering how hyped these games are, I had high expectations after I bought the game and sat down to play it. From the get-go, I loved how the game's action was designed with a strong emphasis on gear and squadmates, and a smaller emphasis on combat, which was generally very easy on normal difficulty (and honestly it wasn't that challenging on hard). The decisions, however, were far from easy. I'll avoid spoilers, but Sheperd's decisions can mean life or death for some members of the crew, which you grow attached to throughout the campaign. Mass Effect is all about role-playing and it does it very well. If you don't feel emotionally invested in Sheperd and his crew, you're playing the game wrong. It's not so much the gameplay (which is still pretty good), but the emotion and ability to make the story your own that makes it a really good game. I'll definitely be playing the sequel soon. 8.75/10.","July 8, 2014","true","27.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Many games with multiple endings, with a sequel, just assume a given ending. With Mass Effect, the choices you make... matter.\n\nMass Effect 1 is good for a rich storyline. It has some flaws, as in the Mako missions where you have to drive up the side of a hill almost sideways, and gravity is very unrealistic. But, for the most part... it is a fun enough game to play. Most games average around 50-60 hours (as in Final Fantasy)...

This game is just awesome.\n\nWhere do I start...\n\nFirst of all the game looks pretty good, even if its a bit older. I don't have a computer that can play on the highest settings honestly, but I still found it enjoyable and looked pretty clean to me. Regardless I don't really care that much to be honest ;p\n\nOh and the combat is pretty enjoyable I find. Its a shooter type of combat basically, but with a few RPG elements to the combat, I find it quite enjoyable personally, the number of ablities are not overly abundant, but I'm ok with that. I find it doesn't bother me a ton. The combat was also pretty well made so that you, in most cases, can't just go in the middle of the fight, and you actually have to take cover and stuff. It was pretty decently challanging at times and I was playing on the normal difficulty or default one or whatever. Maybe I just suck, idk ;p. But it typically doesn't feel to easy.\n\nThe part about the game that is arguably the best however is the story, and the interacting with characters, its hard to pick one, but they sort of go hand in hand to an extent.\n\nI won't spoil the story to those who haven't played, but I found it very good, it felt like I was watching a movie and I was always curious as to what would happen next, or in the future.\n\nAs for the interaction with other characters, especially squad members, it is just very interesting. In talking to the different crew members you learn more about them, and sometimes about different species, and you even learn about other background information and their personal thoughts on things. Not to mention sometimes get missions. You can also romance with any squad member of the opposite gender if you so choose ;p.\n\nOh and you can loose squad members(I lost two in my playthrough) which sounds bad, but it only happens through story events. Some are unpreventable to my knowledge, and they lead to some hard choices, which can really play with your emotions and make you feel guilty.\n\nOverall the game does a great job of getting you attached(Or to hate) the different characters, and that is just really enjoyable.\n\nHowever the game isn't without its flaws. First of all the game I noticed had a fair number of bugs, some minor, others frusterating, and some making it so I had to reload the game. I only encountered maybe 5 in my whole playthrough, but I think 3 of them involved me falling through the world and having to reload the game, which was frustating at times.\n\nThere is also a weird black siloute bug that apparently involves AMD processors or something, look it up, I did and apparently others with AMD processors and stuff have similar issues, not unplayable with it, and it only occurs in like two different worlds in the main story, but it can be a bit annoying.\n\nAnother thing I noticed is that atleast concerning the classes that don't specialize in using the sniper there is no scope, its like a blind fire weapon basically and totally useless. Of course I haven't played anything besides sentinel, so it could be different on them.\n\nFrankly the weapons besides the pistol that I had a specialization in on my class where kinda useless I found and I never used any much besides the pistol and sometimes the shotgun, but thats really not that big of a deal, the sniper ones really the biggest issue concerning the weapons.\n\nOverall the game is great, it has me hooked after playing through it once, and contemplating playing again, so i'd say its well worth it. I'm going to go after the next games in the series as soon as I can.\n","April 28, 2014","true","19.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

The game has great universe with interesting political dynamics between the species. The game also has great music to go along with the space hero-simulation. You pretty much just shoot guns in fairly easy combat and then listen to really high quality voice acting in the scenes between fighting/exploring. There are quite a few side quests. A couple battles can be tough if you alot your experience-points to a weird character configuration. You can pick members of your crew to have romantic relations with, which spices up things a little.","March 3, 2014","true","180.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'd not read any reviews on the game, so had no idea what to expect once I bought it. I guess, truth be told, I only bought it because it was so cheap and I hoped it could fill a few hours one boring evening after work. Oh, sweet Mass Effect, you didn't disappoint!\n\nThere aren't many games that I genuinely wish I could remove from my memory, in order to replay again with a fresh set of eyes, but the exceptional story of Mass Effect, combined with the excellent character acting, life and death decisions that you'll face, and Shepherd's development and rise from traumatised soldier to first human Spectre, is a real work of genius.\n\nDespite this game being made in 2008 (I think), I only started playing it in March 2014. In total, I've spent around 43 blissfully happy hours running through the main story and side quests (excluding those pesky 'collect so many of this type of tag' quests). I know many games don't age well, but Mass Effect doesn't look old, nor dated, and if I didn't know the age of this game, I'd quite truthfully believe it was new and current.\n\nI'll close by saying that anyone not already familiar with Mass Effect should buy it immediately - well, if you like story driven games, of course. If not, just wait for a Steam Sale and buy it when it's virtually free!\n\nNow, enough singing the praises of Mass Effect - I was also fortunate enough to buy Mass Effect 2 in the same sale. I just hope it lives up to my lofty expectations and doesn't lose the excitement built from this true classic!","March 21, 2014","true","43.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This isn't surprising. Bioware games tend to be very plot-heavy and less centered on action. More talky-talky bits and extreme decision making. Less shooty-killy.\nThe downside is that while you get a good chunk of the story in the beginning, it doesn't really pick up fully until over halfway through the game.\nDon't get me wrong. When it picks up, it really picks you up and throws you over the table and repeatedly screws you.\n\n-Decisions. Like in Dragon Age, the choices you make do effect the rest of the gameplay and subsequent events. Impacting in the next two games for the trilogy, though I've yet to play 'em.\n\n-Action. My first rpg shooter. I like that it wasn't so centered on kill-kill-kill. It allowed me time to get into it, and I'm not big on shooters. This doesn't feel like it's utterly in my face. It's third-person shooter, so I think that helps.\n\n-Controls. Very easy to get used to.\n\n-Gameplay. Very few timed events.\n\n\nCons:\n\n-Controls. Yes, this is a pro, but in a few cases, it's a con. And it's only a con when you're in a vehicle called the Mako. Mass Effect was a game designed for the console, not the PC. And it shows. Holy hell, does it show.\nMy driving is akin to a drunkard on speed. I managed to flip the damn car over when gravity was on MY side. Every death I suffered was due to that damn car. And you need to use that car a lot. It kills a lot of the fun within the game. Thankfully, it's not essential to the overall game, and if you're not a completionist, you won't have to use it that often.\n\n-The 'lockpicking'. It took me forever to figure out wtf I was supposed to do. The game offers you no direction on that. And in decrypting something, the codes are a bit iffy as opposed to how it is for the xbox or PS3. It's a pain in the ♥♥♥. Once you learn what the hell to do, it's pretty simple. But until you figure it out, it's just banging your head against the wall.\n\n-Characters need more by way of development. What was there was definitely touching, and I'm in NO way saying that these characters aren't awesome in their own right. I was touched by a few of their stories. But perhaps I'm spoiled by DA, and Bioware is pretty known for their character development, interactions, etc.\n\n-Romances. One male romance for a female main character. One female romance for a male main character. And one female romance for either gender main character.\n\nThough I'll give it points for having the bisexual love interest be an alien.\n\nAwesome points:\n\n-The aliens. Lots of variations, and I really like 'em all. Humans are pretty much on the lower rung here. There are prejudices, other alien races don't much care for humans and humans are the minorities. There's a small group of humans that are all Human Pride sort of thing, but they're largely irrelevant.\n\n-The Reapers. I don't want to give any spoilers here, but these are seriously such a badass group of villains. The game made them genuinely scary.\n\n-The planets. This probably won't mean much to those who don't care about lore or anything like that, but I found the short summarizations on the different planets to be pretty damn cool and innovative.\n\n\nThe Ugly:\n\n-The profiles. You cannot make a pretty male Shepherd or a pretty female Shepherd. The textures, lights, shadows, angles will make even the most meticulously done Shepherd fugly. It's highly annoying.\n\n-This is one of those games in which it's hard to figure out the first time you play it. Not controls-wise, but everything else-wise. Where to go, what to see, etc. Largely because this world is so big. It's a solar system and it FEELS like a solar system.\nHowever, once you've completed one playthrough, you won't really need a guide anymore. It helps that it's a pretty short game. It could probably be played through in the course of a weekend.","March 16, 2014","true","88.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

OK lets say you die, not that rare, there are a lot of enemies that can 1 to 2 hit you if you can't see them, this means you are relying on the last save point, but since the environments are so big that means the last auto save could be 30mins ago. ALSO, if there are any cutscenes that occur your going to have to go through them again because unlike 99% of all other games that would autosave your progress after a cutscene, in this game thats not the case. BUT wait there is quick saving right? Wellllll, quick saving only works if there are no enemies, so if there is a string of enemies a long a 30 min trek you are ♥♥♥♥ out of luck my friend. The game should keep track of 3 quick saves and allow you to quick save at any point that, that way i don't need to repeat the same 45 mins of my life over again like some lamer version of Groundhogs Day and if I quick save a death by accident I could use the previous quick save. Also, the last boss is a measure of your patients as he is health bar Mcgee, not hard, just repetative and boring.\n\nOverall Its a good game, I just wise it didn't make me feel like I was getting in the way of it's story all the time.","March 26, 2015","true","23.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theatomicpenguin/recommended/17460/","theatomicpenguin","The Atomic Penguin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theatomicpenguin/","486 products in account","One of the best modern story-driven RPG's I've ever played. I have no complaints about ME1. I loved every minute of my 2 playthroughs. On my 5yr old PC there were no graphic glitches, no lag or issues of any kind. Just smooth sailing graphics & a wonderful story. The characters are well-written, even the ones you don't like (looking at you Ashley). As in KOTOR, you can go Light or Dark, good or bad, making Dialog choices to reflect your own personality or how you want Commander Shepard to be perceived. In this game at least, your choices don't really affect the endgame outcome. Your choices DO open up different dialog options and some side quests. It adds fun flavor to the game.\n\nI loved finding all the armor & weps scattered around everywhere you go. I liked the hacking puzzle mini-game to open caches. It reminded me of the similar hydraulic puzzle game in Bioshock, which I also loved - both the main game & the mini puzzle game.\n\nThe DLC is FreeAnother plus for ME1 is the 2 DLC's are free & easily found to download. Some nice people have already linked them in other helpful reviews, or just Google.\n\nCommon ComplaintsThe Mako\nSome people complain about the Mako, which if you haven't played the game yet, is a tank-like vehicle you drive when you explore planets. I personally loved driving the crazy thing. Yes, it can be hard to control. Things can get a little wild, but it's really not that hard & once you get the hang of it, driving it literally anywhere is good fun. Mostly though, combat in the thing with its cannon & gun are a literal blast.\n\nExploration\nSome people complained about exploring Planets. I personally enjoyed this aspect as well. You only explore at most, 1 planet per system, & exploring each planet only takes a few minutes. Of course, I did really like driving the Mako so any excuse to get in the thing & go nuts was welcome.\n\nGame Won't Start, or get a Black or White Screen then game won't start\nThis did actually happen to me once, but is VERY simple to fix. Find the game's .exe, right click it and select "Open as Administrator". If that doesn't work for you, exit Steam, then Right-click Steam to "Open As", THEN rt click ME1's .exe to "Open As". You should only ever have to do this once, then done. It happened to me at about 5hours in. I was frustrated for about 10 minutes before I found this simple solution. After that I just started the game normally for the rest of my playtime.\n\n\n\nOther Similar Games I recommend you play:\nDragon Age Series\nMass Effect Series\nKOTOR Series\nBioshock Series - Especially 1, 2 & Minerva's Den DLC (Excellent standalone story there)\n\nAll of those game titles are equal in my esteem. They all provide good value for the price & all have a great story. These games all really draw you in. IMO you just can't go wrong with any of them.\n\n\nComments About ME2 & 3(*Included here because many people are buying 1&2 here together)\n\nWhile ME1 had only 2 DLC, both of which are now free, ME2 & ME3 both have numerous expensive DLC that never goes on sale. In fact, you can't just "buy" & DL DLC for those 2 games. Nope. Even though you can purchase ME2 on Steam, you have to go to Origin to get the DLC for it.\n\nOf course some people needlessly complain about Origin, but truthfully, Origin is awesome. It's a very solid Game Management / Store Interface, just as good as Steam for it's own purposes.\n\nAnyway, say you buy the ME1/2 pack here on Steam & you want to then buy DLC for the game, which must be done on Origin (or also on social.bioware.com). ME2/Deluxe does come with a tiny bit of DLC, which you can also activate on Origin along with the base game, should you wish to. Simple steps are needed:\n\nInstall the game in Steam\nRight-click ME2 in your Steam library and "View CD Key" (The game must be installed to have this option)\nOpen Origin. If you didn't already, create an account & log in.\nAt the top left, click on Origin, then click "Redeem Product Code"\nThere are 3 codes for ME2. Copy each from the little Steam window, one at a time, then paste to Activate in the Origin app.\nFind the game in your Origin Library, hover the mouse over it then click the little italicized "i", which opens a more detailed Information page.\nOn the Info page you can see a list of all the DLC, much of which is free. However, the good stuff, namely the Content packs which give you more missions & not just fluff cosmetics, cost money.\n\nActually, they cost "Bioware Points". Yes, it's lame, but there's no way around it. BC although Bioware makes insanely awesome games, the guy in charge of setting up the sale of DLC is obviously a crackhead. There's simply no other explanation for why they think this is a good idea, as opposed to just being able to put all the desired DLC in your cart then buying it all straight up.\n\nNope. You put what you want in the cart, then when you Checkout......it takes you to buy Bioware Points. 1600 Points sells for $20, 1200/$15 & 800/$10. It's very simple math to figure out which DLC you really want then convert the dollar value to how many Bioware Points you need. It's really very annoying, but it's not that complicated.\n\nYou're going to need ~$40 for all the ME2 DLC. More for ME3. So, even though you probably only paid $20 for all 3 games (on sale of course), you're going to probably be forking out $80+ more dollars for any content & cosmetics you may want for ME2 & ME3.\n\nOne last note. I hear that DLC you buy for ME2 (in Origin of course) can also be activated in your Steam copy of the game, though I don't see the need to do it, so I've never tried. I honeslty don't know why you wouldn't just play it in Origin. But it's said to be possible should you wish to try it.\n\nHope this info was helpful. Enjoy!","June 22, 2015","true","146.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A story where your decisions actually impact how the story progresses.\n\nThe graphics certainly weren't anything to shake a stick at. They were solid for the time period, but definitely not anything mind blowing. The music was wonderful, with plenty of jams that I enjoyed along the way.\n\nThe gameplay is what truly stood out to me. I'm not a big fan of shooters, but this game allowed me to appreciate them. Tie in some RPG elements to anything and I'll be willing to give it a go. The vast planets that you can explore and the isolation of some of them really made you feel like you were a part of a universe that was very real.\n\nI don't have enough good words to say about ME. If you've never played it at all, I urge you to pick it up and give it a go, no matter what kind of a gamer you classify yourself as.","April 22, 2014","true","40.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The only downside I can think of, is that in order to complete every possible thing you can, you do A LOT of "Moon Patrol" type play. Driving a vehicle on alien planets that are pretty much just bare and offer only small changes from the last naked alien planet you were driving on. You can however complete the game without doing EVERY part, and thus can avoid much of this.\n\nThe best part of this game is how you can import your character into ME2 and the choices you made have an effect on what happens.\n\nMy suggestion, if you can, is to start up ME2, and make your toon there first (face) get a code and THEN make it in ME1. Otherwise you import your toon and do not get a code, forcing you to start over making a face. Bad if you get attached to your Shepard, which happens easily.\n\nI suggest playing as a female Shepard, no, not (just) because of eye candy, but because I honestly feel that the female voice acting is better, and somehow the Shepard character makes more sense as a woman. Plus when you choose the renegade (badass) options, rather than the goodygoody options, it just makes them sound 100% cooler comming from a woman ^_^.","January 23, 2014","true","47.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Space-themed game with focus on story? Sounds right up my alley.\n\nRight away, I need to criticize the main city of the game, the Citadel. Who in the world designed this mess? I'm not saying it's fugly. In fact, it looks quite nice. It's just that it's poorly laid out and needlessly labyrinthine... especially for a main hub of the game.\n\nThe shooter aspect was okay. I'm not really a first or third person shooter type, but it worked, and it was playable, so I'll leave it at that.\n\nI'm still not exactly sure what the point of scanning planets for resources was. It was hardly crucial to the plot or gameplay. Just a pure homage to Star Control?\n\nReplay value is... there. I admit I would have liked to go back and earn some achievements that provide rewards, but the gameplay just wasn't enticing enough to me to warrant a second playthrough. I need to note that playing as a Paragon is boring as hell. I recommend trying out a Renegade to bring out the more interesting conversations.\n\nThe game has excellent atmosphere, and some pretty interesting alien backstory. I don't quite understand the trend of cramming in bucketloads of irrelevant information in the in-game encyclopedia, but I guess there's an audience for it. The strength of the game I feel is in the character conversations, but those weren't as frequent as I would have liked.\n\nOverall I'd have to say I wasn't disappointed. I wasn't blown away by the plot, though that's my fault for setting a high expectation. The main story isn't the kind of story that makes you a better person for having experienced it, but it was interesting nonetheless, especially towards the end.

The term epic has lost its impact in todays world, but its a word the sits rightly next to this game. Every choice you make has an effect on the universe your trying to protect and its never a dull moment. You'll make friends and enemies, you'll gain allies and betray friends. Its a game that is designed solely to reflect a character who is fighting against the universe for what he believes in, and that philospohical statement is totally up to the player to influence. If you a fan of RPG's then you are doing yourself a grave disservice by missing the beginning sequence of one of the best trilogies on any medium to grace this Earth. I recommend playing this one first,because it may be hard to play if you play 2 or 3 first  with the slight change in gameplay designs.","November 16, 2011","true","78.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The gameplay might be a bit monotonus, but rewarding items, the story and your possible decisions make up for it.\n\nWhen I first played it I was AMAZED by how well every detail is described. Why the machines and weapons work and what they do. What every alien species backstory is and why they behave like they behave.\nIt's a whole new universe to discover. I haven't seen any game before that cared so much about filling every logical hole and describing so much details, expanding the story to such great amounts. Awesome!\n\nAlso, if you're a fan of astronomy, you'll love it so much more. Enjoy the most epic views of standing on a planets moon, being on a planet of a binary star system, or watch thousands of meteors raining down from the sky.\nAs a fan of science, you might notice some physical details which aren't correct as they are. Like planets temperature described as going below the point of absolute zero (-273,18°C is not possible), our local sun shining yellow in space, or other little details. Nothing what would involve gameplay or bother you in some way.\n\nAll in all, great game.

I would (and do) highly recommend the Mass Effect Trilogy to anyone who finds themselves enthralled with single player experiences and Mass Effect is one of the best you can find.\n\nI am currently on my second playthough of the Mass Effect Trilogy and I'm sure when I'm finished I will jump straight back in to Mass Effect 1 again.\n\nMass Effect follows what I like to call the "constants and variables" theory of storytelling. This means that the story has a few key sections that all players will experience, yet the road there can be different from person-to-person. Moreover, the types of decisions you make can also affect the outcome these "constant" events. The main decision elements come from your ability to either take a Paragon (good) or a Renegade (somewhat evil, more of a ♥♥♥♥ really) approach to decision making, earning points through doing so allows you to automatically open up more conversation options to enhance your experience.\n\nI personally feel that Mass Effect has pretty good character customisation - with not just how they look, but how you lay out your play style for the rest of the game. Being an infiltrator allows you to snip enemies from afar to deal a lot of damage. Whereas, you have a soldier who is a master of all weapons and usually likes to be in the thick of the action. The same can also be said of a Vanguard, they mix the world of Biotics (like superpowers) and guns together.\n\nThe only downside to Mass Effect 1 is the glitches that can occur (and usually do for me), but a quick google of fixes usually resolves the issue. The hacking system is also only a minor gripe at what is one of my favourite games.\n\nIn conclusion, the positives of Mass Effect extremely out weight the negatives.\n\n9/10 from me (because it's not Mass Effect 2)","September 23, 2014","true","39.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It was the second-to-last game made by the – legendary – game studio Bioware, before the inevitable quality decline set in, that occurs when a studio is incorporated into the EA roster.\n\nEven though Mass Effect was originally an Xbox 360 exclusive, Bioware did not let the limited hardware hinder the game's potential. The game was a visual masterpiece, and the tight movement and combat naturally inherited from the Unreal Engine played wonderfully into the game's core shooting mechanics. The intense firefights with lasers, explosions, and kinetic powers, kept you at the edge of your seat – but it was the expansive universe, and heavy story elements, that kept you from leaving it.\n\nIf I were to make a parallel between another much beloved piece of media, I'd say that Mass Effect followed the Matrix formula to a T. Much akin to the Matrix trilogy, the first part of the Mass Effect trilogy is an independent piece that stands on its own, it builds up a mysterious and interesting world, and let's you take it in however much you like – but just like the Matrix trilogy, the second and third parts thoroughly disappoint.\n\nWhy The Matrix trilogy went the way it did is a mystery only the Wachowskis can answer for, but as for Mass Effect, we can clearly point our fingers at EA and say: “They did it!”. Mass Effect, along with Dragon Age: Origins, were Bioware's final games that showed the brilliance of the studio. The games that followed are little more than fan-service on top of bad writing. Let's not even start with The Old Republic.\n\nAs for Mass Effect, it's one of the most fleshed out worlds ever created. The game hooks you from the start, and won't let go – even when the credits roll. You're gonna wanna go back, and it's recommended, as the game has twists and turns that will only reveal themselves on second or third playthroughs.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone and everyone.","June 27, 2015","true","8.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Initially under Captain Anderson's command, you are tasked to investigate a distress signal on a planet and during which, you discover that a trusted ally is setting something shady into motion. Throughout the game. you hunt him down and discover the secrets that would have implications on everyone in the known universe.\n\nThe game focuses strongly on the story, during which you would have to make a number of decisions that although may not change the story itself, they translate to your character stats, and also the (remaining) crew that you fight with. (And also your sex life lmao.) The combat system is pretty good in that you fight in a section of 3, where your crew could provide interesting powers or just be meat shields as you recharge your own powerups. However, some hostiles such as snipers or rocket turrets could possibly one-shot Shepard and you would have to restart from where the game last saved. Hence, I do recommend that you consistently manual save or you might have to replay a large part of the mission.\n\nI find the game very well-rounded and enjoyable, back by an interesting story. However, one major set back to the action for me would be the extremely long elevator rides. Seems silly but you would have to play it to understand the agony :)\n\n9.5/10","May 9, 2015","true","17.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is one of my all-time favorite games. The story is really good and the replay value is high due to the fact that you can create different characters focusing on different abilities. Want to be a soldier with all the toys of destruction or a full biotic with limited weapons, or a technician. You can play a character as these types and some in between.\n\nOne of the greatest things about the Mass Effect trilogy is that you can import a completed game character into the next installment of the franchise and get bonuses for completing the last installment and pick your character up where you left off. You of course can always just start a new character as well, but it is the carryover of the character that makes the series really unique.\n\nThe only strikes against it is some of the tedium related to exploring planets and inventory wrangling.\n\nDefinitely a must buy.\n","January 30, 2015","true","42.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's got everything required to make it a classic; interesting and fun characters with unique cultures,  philospohical questions and moral dilemmas, all wrapped around a well-paced and intriguing story (in my opinion the best in the series). It is a wonderful universe that is really easy to get into, though there are a couple of hurdles that really need to be overcome to get a truly great experience out of this. Throughout a lot of the game, characters will spend a LOT of time explaining things to you, like how cultures work and such.  The story, as I mentioned earlier is great, but the gameplay is not. Combat is fairly clunky, cover system is awkward, every gun feels the same, a lot of enemies are braindead and just run up to you with no regard for their own personal safety. Not exactly the highlight of the game, to put it mildly. The Mako, the vehicle which you use for explo-ration as well as a lot of missions, isn't much better either. It's awkward, handles very poorly and is very boring in use for combat, it's generally used for padding outgame length.\n\nStill, it is all in all an amazing game, and gets a 9.1/10 from me.","April 6, 2015","true","82.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

OK lets say you die, not that rare, there are a lot of enemies that can 1 to 2 hit you if you can't see them, this means you are relying on the last save point, but since the environments are so big that means the last auto save could be 30mins ago. ALSO, if there are any cutscenes that occur your going to have to go through them again because unlike 99% of all other games that would autosave your progress after a cutscene, in this game thats not the case. BUT wait there is quick saving right? Wellllll, quick saving only works if there are no enemies, so if there is a string of enemies a long a 30 min trek you are ♥♥♥♥ out of luck my friend. The game should keep track of 3 quick saves and allow you to quick save at any point that, that way i don't need to repeat the same 45 mins of my life over again like some lamer version of Groundhogs Day and if I quick save a death by accident I could use the previous quick save. Also, the last boss is a measure of your patients as he is health bar Mcgee, not hard, just repetative and boring.\n\nOverall Its a good game, I just wise it didn't make me feel like I was getting in the way of it's story all the time.","March 26, 2015","true","23.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game was already very dated five years ago, or so it seemed.  My third playthrough, and my first on the PC, and I'm seeing stunning visuals and textures that were simply not present on the console version.  The game looks worlds better than I remember.  Controls are better (except for the vehicle), and it helps to have a deep understanding of game mechanics from playing all three multiple times through.  My first playthrough of this game was frustratingly difficult because I didn't understand what type of character I had picked or how to properly use the powers.  I suggest a revisit to this game for anyone who liked this series.\n\nTip:  If anyone's having trouble running this game, or using Steam overlay while playing, close Steam, and reopen it as Administrator.  The games will inherit the permissions, and everything will work fine.\n\nTip 2:  For anyone having trouble with resolution settings, dig into the Steam game folder for Mass Effect.  There's a launcher in there that lets you change settings, including increasing resolution (for me, 2560 x 1600, but anything 16:10 will need to be set via this launcher to look correct, because the game will only show 16:9 resolutions while looking at in-game settings.)","May 22, 2015","true","36.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The main story in the sequels might be longer and intense but they don't evoke the feeling of being in a massive universe like this one does.\n\nGameplay wise, it's a bit lacking to be honest - the dialogue choices can be really misleading at times, the combat hasn't aged well and the levels feel a bit sterile or even stale (ex. planetary exploration) at times. Mass Effect 2 might have fixed these issues but at the cost of the more deeper RPG elements of this one.\n\nThe sense of scale and all the little story elements that are hidden in Mass Effect make it a great game, well worth replaying even a few years after release, even knowing it all amounts to nothing (ME3)","July 1, 2014","true","71.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The only downside I can think of, is that in order to complete every possible thing you can, you do A LOT of "Moon Patrol" type play. Driving a vehicle on alien planets that are pretty much just bare and offer only small changes from the last naked alien planet you were driving on. You can however complete the game without doing EVERY part, and thus can avoid much of this.\n\nThe best part of this game is how you can import your character into ME2 and the choices you made have an effect on what happens.\n\nMy suggestion, if you can, is to start up ME2, and make your toon there first (face) get a code and THEN make it in ME1. Otherwise you import your toon and do not get a code, forcing you to start over making a face. Bad if you get attached to your Shepard, which happens easily.\n\nI suggest playing as a female Shepard, no, not (just) because of eye candy, but because I honestly feel that the female voice acting is better, and somehow the Shepard character makes more sense as a woman. Plus when you choose the renegade (badass) options, rather than the goodygoody options, it just makes them sound 100% cooler comming from a woman ^_^.","January 23, 2014","true","47.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was initally hooked by the tight gameplay. This is a very story focused game so the majority of gameplay is very well designed dialogue trees punctuated by cover shooting. The dialogue trees a very intuitive: options that lead to exposition tend to be on the left and  and story advancing, and affecting choices tend to be on the right. The shooting mechanics are pretty simple, but passably enjoyable with the inclusion of biotic powers to add some stratagy to shake things up a bit.\n\nAs for the story of the game it is fantastic. The setting is a galactic community very reminicent of Star Wars with engaging intergalactic politics reminicent of the best of Star Trek & Babylon 5. In short an amazing sci-fi universe. What i like most in a story is the characters, and Mass Effect has some fantastic characters. My favorites being Liara, Garrus, Wrex, Joker, Captain Anderson, Tali'Zora, and of course Wrex. You may have noticed I just listed most of the potental party members and some of the side characters that is how likable and well written Mass Effect's characters are.\n\nLong story short if you are at all a fan of RPGs (this is one of the best i felt fully immersed in the role I was playing), Sci-Fi (the game's universe is the perfect amalgamation of the best of popular Sci-Fi), or even simply great storytelling: Mass Effect comes highly reccommended from me.","September 5, 2015","true","65.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is one of my all-time favorite games. The story is really good and the replay value is high due to the fact that you can create different characters focusing on different abilities. Want to be a soldier with all the toys of destruction or a full biotic with limited weapons, or a technician. You can play a character as these types and some in between.\n\nOne of the greatest things about the Mass Effect trilogy is that you can import a completed game character into the next installment of the franchise and get bonuses for completing the last installment and pick your character up where you left off. You of course can always just start a new character as well, but it is the carryover of the character that makes the series really unique.\n\nThe only strikes against it is some of the tedium related to exploring planets and inventory wrangling.\n\nDefinitely a must buy.\n","January 30, 2015","true","42.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It does, however, have some major drawbacks.\n\nBad Things:\n- Inventory Management. This is just terrible. It's evil. There's nothing about this that is good.\n- The gameplay is not very fluid and often feels halting\n- You can easily romance somebody by mistake and not realize it\n\nGood Things:\n- Story choices\n- Storyline itself\n- You don't have to play as a middle aged white man like most video games\n- You can import your character and her/his choices into Mass Effect 2\n- Jennifer Hale's voice acting\n- Background story","January 4, 2015","true","115.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'd not read any reviews on the game, so had no idea what to expect once I bought it. I guess, truth be told, I only bought it because it was so cheap and I hoped it could fill a few hours one boring evening after work. Oh, sweet Mass Effect, you didn't disappoint!\n\nThere aren't many games that I genuinely wish I could remove from my memory, in order to replay again with a fresh set of eyes, but the exceptional story of Mass Effect, combined with the excellent character acting, life and death decisions that you'll face, and Shepherd's development and rise from traumatised soldier to first human Spectre, is a real work of genius.\n\nDespite this game being made in 2008 (I think), I only started playing it in March 2014. In total, I've spent around 43 blissfully happy hours running through the main story and side quests (excluding those pesky 'collect so many of this type of tag' quests). I know many games don't age well, but Mass Effect doesn't look old, nor dated, and if I didn't know the age of this game, I'd quite truthfully believe it was new and current.\n\nI'll close by saying that anyone not already familiar with Mass Effect should buy it immediately - well, if you like story driven games, of course. If not, just wait for a Steam Sale and buy it when it's virtually free!\n\nNow, enough singing the praises of Mass Effect - I was also fortunate enough to buy Mass Effect 2 in the same sale. I just hope it lives up to my lofty expectations and doesn't lose the excitement built from this true classic!","March 21, 2014","true","43.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"breathtaking, magnificent and absolutely magnetic in game-play"\n\n\nTime:\n39h odd for all the secondary content and some serious running in circles. (I found the 'minimum' minerals needed for one assignment, finding more doesn't matter and is never spoken of. otherwise 100%)\n\n\nbad points:\nOptimisation is very poor, I've turned a lot of the settings down to fix: After an hour or so the game GRINDS TO A HALT and the sounds get chewed up. I'm really not happy with this. (I can run the sequel without problems)\n\nThis game feels like an "Elevator Simulator" ... (please tag product)\n-I mean SERIOUSLY want to know what it's like to stand in an elevator for 8 or 10 seconds EVERY 2 mins??? ... I've added a user interface command to selectively fast-forward its THAT BAD!\n\nThe off-roader (MAKO) is pretty twitchy, and uncontrollable like it only wants to point N, NE, E... rather than steer in smooth circles plus it gets thrown about a lot with the exploration (off-world).\nExploring other worlds with the Mako is a slow slow frustrating process, again thank goodness for the fast forward.\nTrying to walk on mountainous terrain: slow, the characters get stuck or simply can't climb anything that looks like a hill, failing that falling through the floor is a serious risk... This has happened rather a lot!\nThere are a few long 'driving' sections which are a complete waste of time/game-play, I think the maps (both off-world and the driving sections) need an overhaul.\n\n\nI think the game moved a little too fast... Shepard seems to overnight gain the keys to the GALAXY... Makes me wonder exactly what did happen on Eden Prime????\nAfter 22h.... I'm sadden to say I feel almost ready for the story to wrap up. While the cites are just amazing the exploration off-world has too much obvious "recycling" ... It feels like fan-art or a mod!\nand it just doesn't bloody stop, pointless 'side-mission' after pointless 'side-mission'\n\n\nI few more story missions recouped my enthusiasm for the game, but not a replay yet... but I do have the sequel lined up.\n\n\nOverall I give this game 8.5/10 (recall my non-linear scoring system)","May 14, 2014","true","39.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is a third-person, role playing, story-driven shooter and it successfully accomplishes all it sets out to be.  The main storyline clocks in at around 13 hours but the game is packed with other missions and planets to explore on your own time.  Throughout the exploration and firefights, you will surely become attached to certain characters, so decisions you'll have to make later will put you in a cold sweat.  Shooting mechanics in this game are solid, but sometimes feel lacking.  As for the leveling system, not all the skill points you earn feel as if they've gone to any use since there is such a large array of skills and plenty of point slots necessary to fill so as to reach the next power.

I would say there is more reading in the sense of a history/science book, then actual gameplay. The beginning parts itself, will plague you with a quite a few hours of reading just to orient you towards the first couple layers of story.

It definitely makes it in my top 10 games of all time. Even though its combat does seem stale and a bit boring the overall epicness and fun of the story definitely makes up for it. The writing definitely makes you feel like a grand space hero and an important figure. All choices do matter and you regret some of them due to the outcome. The character Customization does fall a little short with very little options to chose from. The game sometimes feels unbalanced and can sometimes be extremely difficult. There are some moments with bad dialogue like during combat with enemy and some NPCs. The overall experience is very grand and very fun but it does have some flaws that are a bit annoying.

The game was already very dated five years ago, or so it seemed.  My third playthrough, and my first on the PC, and I'm seeing stunning visuals and textures that were simply not present on the console version.  The game looks worlds better than I remember.  Controls are better (except for the vehicle), and it helps to have a deep understanding of game mechanics from playing all three multiple times through.  My first playthrough of this game was frustratingly difficult because I didn't understand what type of character I had picked or how to properly use the powers.  I suggest a revisit to this game for anyone who liked this series.\n\nTip:  If anyone's having trouble running this game, or using Steam overlay while playing, close Steam, and reopen it as Administrator.  The games will inherit the permissions, and everything will work fine.\n\nTip 2:  For anyone having trouble with resolution settings, dig into the Steam game folder for Mass Effect.  There's a launcher in there that lets you change settings, including increasing resolution (for me, 2560 x 1600, but anything 16:10 will need to be set via this launcher to look correct, because the game will only show 16:9 resolutions while looking at in-game settings.)","May 22, 2015","true","36.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Your choices matter and will affect the end result further down the line.\nCharacter development is strong. With Garrus being my favourite team member. Seriously, that Turian is awesome. Male Shepard and Garrus are the best bromance I've ever seen in a game.\nThe RPG elements are in depth and gives you the opportunity to mould your character in any way you want.\nThe combat is slightly lacklustre, but it can be forgiven and doesn't detract from the core game.\n\nOne main negative that a lot of people didn't like was the Mako. Sure it was ungainly and could almost climb near vertical cliffs. But I rather enjoyed the exploration it opened up for you.\nYou could travel to a planet, land on it and search locations noted on your map. Most of these locations didn't add anything to the main story line, but for me it brought me into the world more, it added lore and detail to the world.\n\nMass Effect is starting to look slightly outdated these days, though that is a given considering that it's over 8 years old from its first release date.\n\nBuy this game, just for the fact that it'll suck you in and prepare you for the awesome ride that is Mass Effect 2 and most of 3. (I won't go into the details of 3 here, but I'm sure most people know of what I'm on about).","December 4, 2015","true","68.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Just the problems with it blared in my face throughout the game.\nFirst lets start with the Auto saving. I found it so frusterating that the Autosave would save in the beginning of the level. I would die, Then i would have to goto the last save/autosave, And it would be at the beginng of the level i was finding myself dieing at noveria and viremere. And when i couldnt save Wrex? i restarted from my last save so i could save him, geuss what? i had to start at the beginning of the level. Another problem i have with the game is The ♥♥♥♥ing Mako. It is single handedly the worse vehicle i have ever drove in a game. When i was on the second last level, it was bounceing off walls, Barely going in a straight line, it was so bad i couldnt even get to the conduit. GEUSS WHAT I HAD TO REDO THAT WHOLE SECTION (even though the mako controlled better, I was still extremely frusterated). In Noveria (peak 15) And the second last level, Geuss what? Shepard and his crew, and most of the enemys were all black textures This completely ruined the atmosphere for me. The negatives are very negative. But the postives are extremely postive. The story is great, Very morbid, And at times inspirational. I suggest you level up your Charm/Intimadation levels because they are very handy. And if you dont have them you have no choice but making regretable decisions.This game is epic, and the sequels are ten times better. The choice making is great, Interaction is great. Fighting is okay. A.i is okay (depends on what difficulty i would assume) Is it worth 20 dollars? Probably not. it hasnt aged that well, i would say pick it up if its on sale, thats what i did. I love this game even if it frusterated me at times. just beware this game isnt perfect.\n\nIn conclusion. eh","May 5, 2015","true","13.7"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","1"

It's a bit rough around the edges, but does not disappoint despite its age.\n\n+It's an epic space adventure, in which you save the galaxy!\n+Did the above sound awfully generic?  Well, I was surprised at the effort they put into creating a whole new universe with numerous alien races and technologies.  They even put this optional but very cool information in a codex whenever you interact with objects or people.\n+A diverse cast of crew members with cool backstories, They even talk to each other when you ride the elevator (and thank gods for that)!\n+Combat is generally fun.  Mostly with guns, as well as whatever technological or biotic (mass manipulating) skills you decide to learn.  You can also pause at any time to give orders to your party members.\n+The "morality" tree isn't clear-cut good/evil, but renegade/paragon.  So your lawful actions don't cancel out your chaotic ones, or vice versa.  Instead each contributes to their own separate bar, which enables more dialogue options in the future should you invest the skill points.\n+For the most part, you're free to do missions (both the main story and side missions) in any order you choose, flying around on your awesome spaceship\n\n-The character movement can be clumsy.  I've gotten killed more than once when Shepard decides he can "take cover" behind a tiny piece of debris.\n-Vehicular controls are extremely clumsy.  ♥♥♥♥ driving on hilly terrain, especially.\n-Side missions can be pretty repetitive after a while, especially since ~70% of them involve driving around planets that are reskinned versions of each other to get to buildings whose layouts are also copies of each other.\n-Inventory size limit is not a huge problem, but still a hassle.

This game is not about shooting things because you can.  This game, is above that.  This game plays a psychological role in your life, depending on whether you allow it to or not.  If it is to be held as an open-world RPG, let the world be the minds of each person you meet, whether for the first time or the last.  Personally, I believe this is more of an RPG than TES or Fallout, as the role you play shows an impact on the world around you, and the decisions you make can decide whether or not you live as a role-model of humanity or a menace that holds importance.","June 26, 2014","true","87.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

The combat in ME3 is better, but the cost is too high.\n\nPro:\n\n+ Lots of different guns and armor with a ton of different mods. Lots of useless ones too.\n+ Lots of dialogue and very few cutscenes.\n+ Pretty funny dialogue choices at times, especially the Renegade options can be pretty funny and abusive.\n+ Big square planet maps & the Mako. The only game in the ME series with a tactical choice.\n+ Experience points for Kills. Time to go hunting for Thresher Maws & Geth!\n+ Unlimited ammo, but with overheating and recoil. Nice diversity of guns and mechanics.\n+ Import of previous 'veteran' characters.. Practically no level limit..\n+ Lots of skills.\n\nCons:\n\n- The dialogue choices doesn't quite reflect what's being said. Quite often far from it. It's a gamble. How's that RPG?\n- Quite often different dialogue options leads to the same result or none at all. Just for show.\n- Once you are overloaded you can't sort through your entire inventory to scrap the least useful ones in favor of the last additions, which often happens to be a lot better than anything else you've got.. (Bleh, Of course).\n- No three-some!!

It definitely makes it in my top 10 games of all time. Even though its combat does seem stale and a bit boring the overall epicness and fun of the story definitely makes up for it. The writing definitely makes you feel like a grand space hero and an important figure. All choices do matter and you regret some of them due to the outcome. The character Customization does fall a little short with very little options to chose from. The game sometimes feels unbalanced and can sometimes be extremely difficult. There are some moments with bad dialogue like during combat with enemy and some NPCs. The overall experience is very grand and very fun but it does have some flaws that are a bit annoying.

The music alone deserves a playthrough, not to mention the amazing and complex storyline and the many interesting details that can be found throughout the insanely well-crafted universe. I will never forget Chora's Den or Flux (Shepard-dance, anyone?), the heart-wrenching decisions I had to make, the friends I have found (Anderson! Garrus! Wrex!), or the romances I've had (Ashley! Liara!), and despite the evident weaknesses the game has, when it comes to game mechanics for example, it is still one of my all-time favorites, surpassing even the following games, ME2 and ME3, in some areas. Making different decisions does not only change the course of the story, so that you discover new witty and interesting dialogs every time you play through the game (Shepard: "I'm ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off. When I get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off, I shoot things.", discovered on my 3rd playthrough), they do also have an effect on the two successors. My suggestions is this: Get the game, make your OWN Shepard (not the standard one!) and just ♥♥♥♥ing enjoy! Take your time, however: This game is not something for ADS kiddies who usually play CoD or Battlefield. It is like a good book, except for all the additional benefits the medium video game has to offer.

Just the problems with it blared in my face throughout the game.\nFirst lets start with the Auto saving. I found it so frusterating that the Autosave would save in the beginning of the level. I would die, Then i would have to goto the last save/autosave, And it would be at the beginng of the level i was finding myself dieing at noveria and viremere. And when i couldnt save Wrex? i restarted from my last save so i could save him, geuss what? i had to start at the beginning of the level. Another problem i have with the game is The ♥♥♥♥ing Mako. It is single handedly the worse vehicle i have ever drove in a game. When i was on the second last level, it was bounceing off walls, Barely going in a straight line, it was so bad i couldnt even get to the conduit. GEUSS WHAT I HAD TO REDO THAT WHOLE SECTION (even though the mako controlled better, I was still extremely frusterated). In Noveria (peak 15) And the second last level, Geuss what? Shepard and his crew, and most of the enemys were all black textures This completely ruined the atmosphere for me. The negatives are very negative. But the postives are extremely postive. The story is great, Very morbid, And at times inspirational. I suggest you level up your Charm/Intimadation levels because they are very handy. And if you dont have them you have no choice but making regretable decisions.This game is epic, and the sequels are ten times better. The choice making is great, Interaction is great. Fighting is okay. A.i is okay (depends on what difficulty i would assume) Is it worth 20 dollars? Probably not. it hasnt aged that well, i would say pick it up if its on sale, thats what i did. I love this game even if it frusterated me at times. just beware this game isnt perfect.\n\nIn conclusion. eh","May 5, 2015","true","13.7"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zhaijuan/recommended/17460/","zhaijuan","zj","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zhaijuan/","79 products in account","Mass Effect is a story-rich FPS where you play as Shepard, in a time where the universe is starting to realise the potential of the human species in taking up bigger responsibilities alongside others. Initially under Captain Anderson's command, you are tasked to investigate a distress signal on a planet and during which, you discover that a trusted ally is setting something shady into motion. Throughout the game. you hunt him down and discover the secrets that would have implications on everyone in the known universe.\n\nThe game focuses strongly on the story, during which you would have to make a number of decisions that although may not change the story itself, they translate to your character stats, and also the (remaining) crew that you fight with. (And also your sex life lmao.) The combat system is pretty good in that you fight in a section of 3, where your crew could provide interesting powers or just be meat shields as you recharge your own powerups. However, some hostiles such as snipers or rocket turrets could possibly one-shot Shepard and you would have to restart from where the game last saved. Hence, I do recommend that you consistently manual save or you might have to replay a large part of the mission.\n\nI find the game very well-rounded and enjoyable, back by an interesting story. However, one major set back to the action for me would be the extremely long elevator rides. Seems silly but you would have to play it to understand the agony :)\n\n9.5/10","May 9, 2015","true","17.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For today's standards (regarding graphics and whatnot), it still holds up, and has some pretty good visuals. They do look a bit dated, of course, but for a game originally released in 2007, it looks great. Several people have complained about the Mako (driving) sections, and while the controls are a bit wonky, it still is a good idea, and it's not as bad as most people make it sound. And now,  let's talk about the heart of this game, and what makes it so special; the expanding, interesting, epic and completely immersive story filled with fully fleshed characters that you care about, amazing plot-twists, and an open ended narrative. This is what makes the ME series so special, along with it's bigger-than life space opera setting. Finally, I have to say that this game is a bargain. It offers at least 30 hours of gameplay, and if you explore every little corner and do every single side quests, those 30 hours could easily stretch to 50. Get this thing ASAP.","December 26, 2015","true","15.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The music alone deserves a playthrough, not to mention the amazing and complex storyline and the many interesting details that can be found throughout the insanely well-crafted universe. I will never forget Chora's Den or Flux (Shepard-dance, anyone?), the heart-wrenching decisions I had to make, the friends I have found (Anderson! Garrus! Wrex!), or the romances I've had (Ashley! Liara!), and despite the evident weaknesses the game has, when it comes to game mechanics for example, it is still one of my all-time favorites, surpassing even the following games, ME2 and ME3, in some areas. Making different decisions does not only change the course of the story, so that you discover new witty and interesting dialogs every time you play through the game (Shepard: "I'm ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off. When I get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off, I shoot things.", discovered on my 3rd playthrough), they do also have an effect on the two successors. My suggestions is this: Get the game, make your OWN Shepard (not the standard one!) and just ♥♥♥♥ing enjoy! Take your time, however: This game is not something for ADS kiddies who usually play CoD or Battlefield. It is like a good book, except for all the additional benefits the medium video game has to offer.

Your choices matter and will affect the end result further down the line.\nCharacter development is strong. With Garrus being my favourite team member. Seriously, that Turian is awesome. Male Shepard and Garrus are the best bromance I've ever seen in a game.\nThe RPG elements are in depth and gives you the opportunity to mould your character in any way you want.\nThe combat is slightly lacklustre, but it can be forgiven and doesn't detract from the core game.\n\nOne main negative that a lot of people didn't like was the Mako. Sure it was ungainly and could almost climb near vertical cliffs. But I rather enjoyed the exploration it opened up for you.\nYou could travel to a planet, land on it and search locations noted on your map. Most of these locations didn't add anything to the main story line, but for me it brought me into the world more, it added lore and detail to the world.\n\nMass Effect is starting to look slightly outdated these days, though that is a given considering that it's over 8 years old from its first release date.\n\nBuy this game, just for the fact that it'll suck you in and prepare you for the awesome ride that is Mass Effect 2 and most of 3. (I won't go into the details of 3 here, but I'm sure most people know of what I'm on about).","December 4, 2015","true","68.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What a fantastic experience this game was.\n\nI've heard so much about this game before actually getting myself to finally play it. Mainly because I'm not a fan of SCI-FI or shooter. Well I wasn't, before I started Mass Effect.\n\nThis game is incredible. It will drag you in with it's fantastic gameplay, brilliantly written story with massive lore, amazing character development, beautiful music, beautiful landscapes, unique atmosphere, masterfully done voice acting and some of what are probably one of the most memorable characters in the game history.\n\nThis is one of the rare games I actually finished. I have the tendency to play too many things at once to focus on a single game alone. This game, however, was an exception and getting it was probably one of the best decisions I've made in my life. I got it on sales for an € or so, but it is not only worth it's original price, but double that.\n\nI recommend this game to everyone everywhere that cherishes brilliant dialogues, deep character development, huge lore behind the main story, for people that don't want to just walk straight forward and shoot stuff, but for people that enjoy exploring the world they are in, for people that enjoy making decisions and think logically.\n\nTruly a masterpiece.","February 5","true","22.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Megs3Legs/recommended/17460/","Megs3Legs","Kirjava","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Megs3Legs/","456 products in account","I've finally got around to beginning the Mass Effect series, and numero uno was a blast. An incredibly immersive, well crafted and believable universe, I found myself happily getting lost in the cultural depth and history created here, of the Geth, Krogan, Turian, Rachni and more. Mass Effect features a wide range of well written, memorable characters (Liara, Wrex, Garrus, Saren, Anderson, Sovereign, could go on), some great clever dialogue and many funny moments, as well as more painful ones as the consequences of your actions play out through the story. One of the best aspects of the game as you progress is simply getting to know your crewmates that you're choosing to work with mission by mission. The music is fantastic, and acts beautifully to create atmosphere and in binding all the various parts of the game together (Vigil, Galaxy Map theme i'm looking at you). For a title released in 2007/2008 the graphics seem to have endured really well, and again fit perfectly with the overall feel of the game. While you're exploring planets be sure to stop and take a few seconds at the summit of a mountain and look out at the vista before you, it's pretty damn gorgeous.\n\nGameplay wise, combat is fun and pretty well balanced, if a little on the easy side. I found biotic abilities particularly enjoyable, there's also a lot of room to customise gear and weapons as you see fit, especially later in the game. Movement is kept varied in space or on land, between exploring new worlds/buildings on foot or by roaming and driving up sheer cliffs in the Mako, hopping around the interior of the Normandy and navigating the Galaxy Map, there is a real and epic sense of scale here (Moon landing included), and the freedom to seek it out.\n\nThe only slight cons I can think of are somewhat repetitive sidequests; with a bouncy tin tank that has some infamous clunky manoeuvring, and slowpoke elevators (which excellent dialogue and hilarious music almost make up for). The inventory can become a bit tricky to manage. Worlds explored outside of main quests could also be more detailed and fleshed out in terms of content beyond markers on the map.\n\nSummary: A brilliant and deeply satisfying narrative experience overall, and I will be coming back for more playthroughs after visiting the next installments of Mass Effect.\n\nJust play it.","May 28, 2015","true","81.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Strong female protagonist, if you choose for Shepherd to be female.   I, frankly, found the male voice actor to be neutral in his emotions too often.  I don't believe he threw himself into the role as much.\n\nJennifer Hale sounds like she's the hero who held off a Batarian raid of a human colony single-handedly and against all odds.\n\nAnyway, I digress.

And even though it's not exactly state of the art anymore... it still managed to get me hooked quickly.\nYes, it's a few years old, yes, the graphics won't do well if compared to more recent games. But OMG, talk about an immersive game.\nThere are quite a few similarities to KOTOR 1 and 2... its obvious it's the same developer. So if you enjoyed the incredible stories in the KOTOR-games, give this a try. KOTOR of course also was fun because it was set in the SW-universe, and in a very interesting era of that franchise, the old republic. Jedis, the Force, the Dark side etc.\nSo I wasn't sure I'd warm up to a very different universe and franchise. And even though I haven't progressed very far yet, I already do care a lot about the story and the characters. Amazing.\nThe story IS captivating, and so is the combat. It's not the turn-based lightsaber/force-combat of KOTOR, of course - instead, its a tactical shooter, not turn-based. And it's FUN even though I'm usually not at all into that genre at all.\nI haven't even used my squad that much, still warming up to controlling and using my companions but even without that deeper element of the game, I enjoy the action-part of the game a lot. Taking cover, using tactics, choosing your wep, trying to find a good tactic or going for the dangerous method... FUN. And again, I usually am not a fan of shooters.\n\nThe story is totally captivating and interesting. I am not sure whether the balance will work for everyone (sometimes, there is a lot of running around, talking to people etc, before it goes back to action), but for me it works.\nAnd the speech Capt. Anderson gives to his crew rather early on in the game actually gave me goosebumps, I admit it. Heroic moment ftw.\nThe writing rocks, and so do the characters.\n\nNow, keep in mind this game is a bit older. Apart from the graphics which isn't state of the art, there are some issues with the combat. Sometimes, you might be taking cover but can't fire for some reason. You can see the enemy, have a clear line of sight, yet can't shoot until you move a bit more. There are some issues with the Mako too...driving it can be fun, but I had some situations where it bounced like a rubber ball and fell off a cliff. Targeting with it has some issues too...clear line of sight at a drone, shoot, not hitting at all (keep in mind that you have to keep some distance in between the vehicle and enemies when using the Mako)\n\nThe game, like KOTOR shows you a very clear path to your objectives. So you won't run around forever to find a special room... the path is dictated to you rather clearly. This might bother some, I was ok with it. The Citadel is a bit confusing sometimes, but that's ok.\n\nI am amazed by how quickly the game captivated me, and I'm not even far into it yet! I can perfectly understand just why this game is so popular and revered. DOn't let the age scare you away (same with Kotor, and this game looks much better). Amazing.\nEdit: about 10 hrs in... the story gets even more interesting, and the game really makes you think about dialogue choices and decisions you make. It's not always black and white for sure, and I am planning on using my save games to continue through ME2 and 3, so I hope the choices are ok. If not, I'll start over =)\n\nEDIT: OK, finished it. I didn't do a lot of the side-quests, focussed mainly on the storyline. I am rather certain I will at some point go back, start over, try some different choices and do the side-quests too.\nBiggest complaint? It's TOO SHORT!!! (15.7 hours is what the Steam-counter says) However, it's thoroughly enjoyable. The storyline is totally fascinating, and often reminded me of the old Babylon 5-show regarding scope, mystery and background. Great writing, some fascinating twists, several fistpump-moments for the player.\nNo wonder this game is so popular and beloved.

If you're not a fan already, then prepare to become one. In this well balanced RPG game, you call the shots as you lead a crack team of warriors on a mission to save the galaxy.

And prepare to get attached to your companions, as you may well lose them if you don't take care! While the gameplay itself can be buggy at times, it is incredibly intuitive given it was made in '07, though nowhere near as smooth as Crysis. For $20 you are getting something worth far more! So go ahead and download it! Yes I mean you, go ahead and click the download button! I can guarantee you won't regret it!

This game has some of the most interesting characters in any game, and even after playing all three games in the series I still feel a connection to my squadmates. The replay value of this game is incredible as well, as you find yourself wanting to make different choices to see the effect on the outcome.\n\nThat being said, there are issues with the game. Specifically, the combat in the first Mass Effect is less than stellar. It isnt terrible, but the second and third games improve on it so heavily that it is hard to come back and play the first. Plus, the RPG elements of the game can get overwhelming (picking up hundreds of different types of armor, a lot of which you cant use) and managing your inventory can be a chore. The other big issue I have with this game (specifically for the Steam version) is the lack of controller support. This game originally came out on Xbox 360, yet the Steam version only allows keyboard and mouse. There are mods you can do to hack in support for controllers, but they are buggy and not even close to the polish of the Xbox 360 version. The Mouse+Keyboard controls are fine, but it bothers me that I can't use my input form of choice.\n\nOverall though, this game is amazing. Highly recommend.","January 4, 2014","true","23.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I only played Fallout 3 and New Vegas aside from Mass Effect so I don't have much experience in these type of games but here goes.\n\nThe number one reason I kept playing through Mass Effect was the story. The game really let's you control how the story develops while being very interesting at the same time. It was very hard to get in to (haha..) and can be overwhelming for someone who has never played an RPG before, but when you get the hang of the skills, guns and inventory it will be pretty fun.\n\nAlthough I have to say I don't like the combat apart from the usable skills. Yes, you have a plethora of options for your guns, but the guns themselves stay the same through out the game: pistol, shottie, rifle and sniper + grenades. Maybe because I liked the skills more I didn't like the gunplay that much. If you like modding your gun (attachments+ammo type) you probably would like this game but I liked the Fallout 3 weapon system more. The story blows you away and that's what counted the most for me. I liked doing side missions a lot more than combat, but that's me.\n\nTL;DR: Want a great story + ♥♥♥♥ ton of upgrade options + items (although they're pretty much the same items with better stats)?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/soundrecorder/recommended/17460/","soundrecorder","SuperZlayer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/soundrecorder/","606 products in account","So I hadn't ever finished Mass Effect until just a few days ago but in those few hours that it took me to play the game through I thoroughly enjoyed it. The combat is fun, the story engaging, the graphics were fine and, overall, it felt like I WAS Shepard. The biggest compliment I can give this game is the story. It draws you in and absorbs you as you talk to all of these strange and fascinating characters and learn more about them and the worlds around them.\n\nI do have some problems with it though. One of those problems stemming from the fact that, when I first started playing this game, I had no idea where I was supposed to go. The game doesn't always present a clear direction and, while I do appreciate the fact that the map lets you set your own waypoints, it just doesn't direct you the way you would like.\n\nMy biggest gripe with this game however comes in the form of combat. I do enjoy the combat of Mass Effect and it does keep you engaged but the controls are just not quite up to par. Mashing your face into the wall to take cover is not a good way of getting into cover. The later games in the series do this in a better way by mapping it to a button but here I often found myself just running against the nearest rock to get to cover and if that didn't work I would just run to the next one and so on and so forth.\n\nThat being said this game is still excellent. The story is intriguing and the characters just enhance that. I recommend playing this if just for the story and nothing else. In fact, this game is worth a playthrough just for Garrus Vakarian alone. He is the man.","November 25, 2013","true","22.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

You should understand that this lets me, a dead guy on the internet, understand a lot about the person that you are (notice how I said person, not bear, you are not a bear you are a person on the internet and you need to come to terms with reality). From your actions I can tell that your average day consists of two things: 1) Wake up and jack off to furry bear porn and 2) Go to your computer and make fun of openly dead people on the internet. Now, keeping that in mind, lets see what I do with my day. The format will be the action followed by an explanation. Here is my day: 1) Wake up (yes dead people need sleep too if you didn't think that you're racist and should see a psychiatrist and shut yourself off from society) 2) Shower (see item 1 explanation) 3) Solve cold fusion (Ever since I died I have put 100% of my ghostly being into helping society, the fact that you are mean to me on the internet shows that you are worthless as a person (again I said person)) 4) Give the solution to everyone for free (see item 3 explanation) 5) Cure AIDS (You of all people should be interested in this item) 6) Give the cure to everyone for free (notice how you have not gotten the cure to AIDS, this is because you are no longer a person, you are less that dirt) 7) Bring about world piece (notice, again, that you have not seen this piece. This is because you do not deserve to see it, you are less than dirt) 8) Solve all the world's remaining problems (This is because I am a good creature, I am actually worth something, unlike you). I would hope that this list of my every day actions would change your mind when it comes to respecting dead people on the internet (like me), but I would not expect you to, because you are of absolutely no use to anything in this universe whatsoever. Unlike this game. Mass Effect has brought me some solace from your relentless attacks on my being. If it were not for this video game, I would have probably given up on helping this universe. Look around you (if you are not toolbear) and see all the good that this game has done to this world. I would highly recommend buying this game if you like RPGs and science fiction. 9/10\n\n-[M8B] Jamestown (A dead guy on the internet)\n\nP.S. ♥♥♥♥ you toolbear","March 27, 2015","true","31.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","67","2","3","5","0"

Story wise, Mass Effect isn't the best from the Bioware catalogue as I would consider Knights of the Old Republic to be the King there, however that doesn't undermine the fact that Bioware has crafted an original plot without straying too close to Star Wars.\n\nI preferred the gameplay in Mass Effect over KOTOR as the blend of the third person shooter mixed with the rpg elements was a nice touch and I feel Mass Effect is more replayable as a result. There are many ways to build a character in Mass Effect and this felt streamlined and it felt like a nod to classic Rpg's with the typical classes you would find but adding a modern, science fiction twist.\n\nI would thoroughly reccomend Mass Effect to any rpg fan and it proves that Western Rpgs can be just as good if not better than the Japanese counterparts and Bioware truly leads in example of how to create a  masterpiece Rpg with a Western touch.","May 28","true","34.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It has got downsides, like having unremarkable gameplay resemblance to past Bioware games (most notably KotOR 1+2), elevator sim mini-games, half of the weapon and armor upgrades being completely useless, level scaling (why.jpg), copy-paste dungeon layouts (dungeon meaning the exact same buildings on every side-quest planet), and character building + skill trees that are so easy and limiting that it makes character/party builds in Final Fantasy VII look complex (which is not so surprising seeing the dichotomy between the KotOR games and their earlier games, Baldur's Gate for example). Also semi spoiler warning, the background lore and characters are very reminiscent of KotOR games. It is not direct copypaste but it is noticeable, but the quests and characters have their own unique flavors to them.\n\nBut what's great about it? The story, music, characters, and the element of choice in the game. I clocked 62 hours into the game because the characters in my party entertained me (mostly Wrex) and the feeling of traveling to distant galaxies to explore them (and there are MANY of them, you'll be playing for hours) as a captain of my own ship and alien crew was too much fun.

Does it hold up today?\n\nYes, and yes.\n\nFirst of all, the universe is immense, with detailed lore written and performed via audio journals.\n(The games also spawned novelizations, merchandise, and a script for a movie has been in development since 2010)\nThe game was among the first exploring morality, choice, and consequences can lead you down different paths.\n\nAaaand here's where I lose some of you because of my opinion:\n\nI like the Mass Effect universe more than Star Wars universe, in fact, I am not much of a fan at all of Star Wars, not even the original trilogy. There, I said it.\n\nDid Star Wars inspire Mass Effect?\n\nDuh.\n\nI also like Doctor Who, Farscape, and other sci-fi worlds, and just take into consideration that a review is just an opinion.\n\nOk anyone still with me?\n\nWhy is Ashley Williams armor pink and white? It makes not one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bit of sense. She's a marine, not a sex robot. Sure, you can buy Ashley some upgraded armor and retire the pink-and-white "whywouldanyonewearthisinabattlefieldwhiteisimpossibletokeepcleannottomentionitsjustplainsexistatthispoint"\npeice of armor to rest....\n\nBUT WHY??!?!?!\n\nSo apart from a few minor gripes, the game still crafts its story well and creates interesting choices for Shepard to face (even though "Renegade" Shepard is kind of a psychotic ♥♥♥♥ for no reason)\n\nFinal Verdict:\n\n7.5/10 - Definitely worth putting in your collection, with ME2. Pity we'll never get ME3, but just go watch it on Youtube because ♥♥♥♥ EA.\n\nAnd if any of you make a sci-fi space epic, don't put the girls in "powderpuff" fashion armor.\n10/10 girls prefer not being shot thanks to some sexist ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the armory.","May 2, 2015","true","1.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","3"

It has such a vibrant galaxy to explore, great story and beautifully fleshed out characters. The choices you make have minor to major consequences throughout the game world and subsequently affect the 2 following games. 1 playthrough is close to 40hrs if you spend a lot of time exploring, though in a mass effect game 10 hrs of gameplay has more content than most games clocking over 100hrs, they have a real feeling of forward momentum and the pacing between quests or side quests never come across as feeling obtuse.\n\nI did my first playthrough on the 360 as a  infiltrator class paragon and my 2nd on p.c as an adept paragon,  even though I was a paragon both times the game was different  on my 2nd playthrough due to different choices made. I plan on doing even another playthrough  as a renegade, which I'm very excited about because I don't have any idea how it's going to play out due to major choices that can be made. I recommend on either platform but the p.c version does have slightly better graphical quality and they really tightened up the controls with the keyboard and mouse.\n\nThis game feels like a lot of love, care and pride went into it and it shows, this game deserves to played.\n","January 18, 2014","true","41.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/brendissimo/recommended/17460/","brendissimo","Brendissimo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/brendissimo/","277 products in account","Originally posted on June 28, 2010\n\nMass Effect is essentially the cross-breed result of mating Bioware's RPG formula with Gears of War's combat system.\nThe game is a console title first and foremost, which makes many of its flaws all the more apparent on the PC, however the art design, and story telling are top notch, and the roleplaying elements (through not as deep as the game would like you to think) are interesting enough\n\nGraphics- The game features dated graphics technically speaking, even for the original release date. Incredibly low poly models, low res textures, and mediocre effect (particles) make this game less than awe inspiring visually. However the art design and character models are generally pretty good, especially when in comes to aliens, geth, and other creatures. The animations look quite good, and generally the art design is very creative. Cutscenes look quite good, generally speaking, although the overuse of bloom sometimes is annoying.\n\nYet the game is clearly custom tailored for the 5-year-old hardware of consoles, with irritatingly frequent load screens, jarringly low res skyboxes and other textures, and annoying amounts of loading zones masquerading as elevators.\n\nSound- Generally speaking, the music is superb, with a electronica soundtrack that harkens back to deus ex. The voice acting is also generally good, although there are a few rough spots, and the characters are generally memorable as a result. The sounds for weapons and other effects are also quite nice, providing a space age feel to the combat\n\nGameplay- My biggest problem with this game by far is the gameplay, as Bioware seems to have taken their typical RPG formula (which I have mixed feelings about) and mated it with Gears of War's cover and combat systems ( which I hate). Bioware's formula allows for alot of choices in the story, randomized loot drops, and other RPG staples. It is also notorious for lazy level design. absolute cookie cutter carbon copies of levels litter this game, quickly draining what little flavor the side quests hold for you from the game, as there is one generic mine level, two generic settlement levels, and one generic spaceship/station level that the player encounters AGAIN AND AGAIN throughout the game. At least Bethesda knows their level design, give them credit for that. Bioware's level design flat out sucks.\n\nIt doesn't end with cookie cutter levels however, for the driving sequences are equally frustrating. Exploring strange new worlds in a rover and finding hidden collectibles (tedious, but an RPG staple) along with side quests sounds fun in theory, but the Mako handles like a physics nightmare. In addition, some of the terrain is modeled with so few polygons and so extremely steeply that it is almost impossible to simply cruise around the planets. Instead the mako climbs impossible angles, flips and does barrel rolls (without taking damage of course) and gets caught on terrain. In addition, the turret has almost no traverse, and you only get half xp from kills in the mako, making the armaments almost useless. Driving quickly became on absolute nightmare for me, and I was using a mouse and keyboard. I can only imagine how those poor saps with controllers felt.\n\nThird, the cover system is awful and unnecessary. I hate gears of war, or any third person cover shooter for that matter, on principle. So seeing this system in a game made by people who used to develop RPG's for the PC first is awful. It locks you into objects unnecessarily, makes it difficult to get out, and frequently got me killed, frustrating me to no end. It also leaves levels littered with absurd amounts of cover for you and your enemies to use. Not that this unrealistic feature mattered, as the favorite maneuver of most of the AI in the game is to charge straight at your guns.\n\nOther features such as the leveling, perks and squad management worked better, but even those got clunky. For example there is no way to examine your crew member's stats while on the Normandy, so equipping them via the weapons lockers can be very confusing. Inventory management in general is clunky, and needs a menu that is actually designed for the PC. Finally, I found the fact that every member of your squad had one of each weapon, even if they weren't trained in its use, to be very odd, and the fact that armor and weapon stats were not tied to the model or skin of the item gets very confusing. The loot often felt... generic at best.\n\n\nUltimately, this game has a story that will draw you in and it can be a lot of fun to play, but it is full of irritating gameplay, so much so that I would almost recommend skipping all but a select few of the side missions. It has a large amount of replay value, with many classes available to play as and many ways to resolve a situation, (although not as many as you think, 2 dialog choices often result in Shepard saying the same exact thing, a false representation of a choice), and it will keep you playing for many hours. Just take it for what it is: Consolized.","December 31, 2013","true","28.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There are rediculously bad vehicle sections that don't fit with the rest of the game, resource gathering that feels like a chore, and the graphics were not very good when the game came out let alone now. Oh, and the inventory system is an afterthought forcing in some really crappy RPG mechics where they aren't needed. It's still well worth playing.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause the story is incredible and you can load your choices into ME2 and later into ME3. Did I mention the story was incredible? Character based narrative is Mass Effect's bread and butter (that, and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ME3 ending that makes no sense). Seriously skilled story writing, voice acting, direction, pacing,\n\nAlso, a powergamer note, you really need to have a ME1 paragon save in order to get Jack and miranda to both stay loyal in ME2 (cause you need near 100% paragon to swing that trick). ME2 DLC removes this need tnough.\n\nAll that said, I might still recommend watching some ME1 youtube clips and skipping to chapter 2 which has almost no problems on a techincal side and an equally good story.","January 8, 2014","true","24.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Testament to the depth and intricacy of the game and its world, I have beaten this game and its sequels several times. Each time, I have made different choices and experienced different events and even different outcomes. With the benefit of hindsight, choices made in Mass Effect drive events found in its sequels.\n\nIf comparing this first game to the rest of the games, it is reasonable to say that it is clunkier for sure, and it isn't the best version of the game out there. But problems can be persevered with. TextMOD can fix the textures of a certain Turian character, at least; and an INI edit can do the rest, particularly enabling 5.1 sound. However, once this is done, Mass Effect is perhaps the most memorable of the series for the wonder it inspires as an introduction to this rich universe and inspiring characters.\n\nBear in mind, however, that if you wish to use a game-pad, you will require an external mapping program, and there are some irritating quirks with mapping mouse movements to the stick. In Xpadder, I had to add a middle mouse click to all directions. See my guide and downloadable profile. ;)\n\nMass Effect was a revelation when it came out, and even know, though so much of its gloss has faded, it is mostly due to the rest ofthe trilogy being so fantastic in comparison. This entry to the story is mesmerising in its depth and clarity of execution.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/brendissimo/recommended/17460/","brendissimo","Brendissimo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/brendissimo/","277 products in account","Originally posted on June 28, 2010\n\nMass Effect is essentially the cross-breed result of mating Bioware's RPG formula with Gears of War's combat system.\nThe game is a console title first and foremost, which makes many of its flaws all the more apparent on the PC, however the art design, and story telling are top notch, and the roleplaying elements (through not as deep as the game would like you to think) are interesting enough\n\nGraphics- The game features dated graphics technically speaking, even for the original release date. Incredibly low poly models, low res textures, and mediocre effect (particles) make this game less than awe inspiring visually. However the art design and character models are generally pretty good, especially when in comes to aliens, geth, and other creatures. The animations look quite good, and generally the art design is very creative. Cutscenes look quite good, generally speaking, although the overuse of bloom sometimes is annoying.\n\nYet the game is clearly custom tailored for the 5-year-old hardware of consoles, with irritatingly frequent load screens, jarringly low res skyboxes and other textures, and annoying amounts of loading zones masquerading as elevators.\n\nSound- Generally speaking, the music is superb, with a electronica soundtrack that harkens back to deus ex. The voice acting is also generally good, although there are a few rough spots, and the characters are generally memorable as a result. The sounds for weapons and other effects are also quite nice, providing a space age feel to the combat\n\nGameplay- My biggest problem with this game by far is the gameplay, as Bioware seems to have taken their typical RPG formula (which I have mixed feelings about) and mated it with Gears of War's cover and combat systems ( which I hate). Bioware's formula allows for alot of choices in the story, randomized loot drops, and other RPG staples. It is also notorious for lazy level design. absolute cookie cutter carbon copies of levels litter this game, quickly draining what little flavor the side quests hold for you from the game, as there is one generic mine level, two generic settlement levels, and one generic spaceship/station level that the player encounters AGAIN AND AGAIN throughout the game. At least Bethesda knows their level design, give them credit for that. Bioware's level design flat out sucks.\n\nIt doesn't end with cookie cutter levels however, for the driving sequences are equally frustrating. Exploring strange new worlds in a rover and finding hidden collectibles (tedious, but an RPG staple) along with side quests sounds fun in theory, but the Mako handles like a physics nightmare. In addition, some of the terrain is modeled with so few polygons and so extremely steeply that it is almost impossible to simply cruise around the planets. Instead the mako climbs impossible angles, flips and does barrel rolls (without taking damage of course) and gets caught on terrain. In addition, the turret has almost no traverse, and you only get half xp from kills in the mako, making the armaments almost useless. Driving quickly became on absolute nightmare for me, and I was using a mouse and keyboard. I can only imagine how those poor saps with controllers felt.\n\nThird, the cover system is awful and unnecessary. I hate gears of war, or any third person cover shooter for that matter, on principle. So seeing this system in a game made by people who used to develop RPG's for the PC first is awful. It locks you into objects unnecessarily, makes it difficult to get out, and frequently got me killed, frustrating me to no end. It also leaves levels littered with absurd amounts of cover for you and your enemies to use. Not that this unrealistic feature mattered, as the favorite maneuver of most of the AI in the game is to charge straight at your guns.\n\nOther features such as the leveling, perks and squad management worked better, but even those got clunky. For example there is no way to examine your crew member's stats while on the Normandy, so equipping them via the weapons lockers can be very confusing. Inventory management in general is clunky, and needs a menu that is actually designed for the PC. Finally, I found the fact that every member of your squad had one of each weapon, even if they weren't trained in its use, to be very odd, and the fact that armor and weapon stats were not tied to the model or skin of the item gets very confusing. The loot often felt... generic at best.\n\n\nUltimately, this game has a story that will draw you in and it can be a lot of fun to play, but it is full of irritating gameplay, so much so that I would almost recommend skipping all but a select few of the side missions. It has a large amount of replay value, with many classes available to play as and many ways to resolve a situation, (although not as many as you think, 2 dialog choices often result in Shepard saying the same exact thing, a false representation of a choice), and it will keep you playing for many hours. Just take it for what it is: Consolized.","December 31, 2013","true","28.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Trust me, not by a long shot. And I really couldn't tell you or remember what it was that finally made me give it a try. But I did, and I'm glad. A few years after I've now purchased and thorougly enjoyed the whole trilogy on my console (yes, I know, ewww a console gamer). And it all started with this fortuitous purchase. So I've come back after all this time because this game deserves a good review. It's that kind of game.\nME is a well done game. It's as simple as that. The story. The characters. The world and its lore, the sounds and visuals, the atmosphere, the style of the game. And of course, the gameplay. Balanced, yet challenging. Simple and straightforward yet deep, full of possibilities.\nTo be fair, some aspects of the game should be have been more streamlined. For example the equipment system. Another one is the planet exploration. ME is like the coolest, most interesting city with the slowest, most boring elevators. Speaking of which...\nBut no, I digress. If you're that last gamer who still hasn't tried ME, then I'm here to tell you your future self has sent me back in time to tell you that I'LL BE BA-no wait, wrong program... to tell you to give this game its chance. Take it from me, I'm that guy, just like you, who was expecting another loathsome shooter, ready to spew my bitter reproach back at the universe, but in the end just couldn't resist the charm of the game.

It would have just been easier to have a cover button. Meanwhile shooting, it's okay but your kinda op even with the normal guns, heck you could speed run without leaving starting weapons/armor.\n4/10\n\nDialogue/Characters\nNow this is the main reason I was interested in the games. The dialogue is very interesting and the story is very cool (especially the last battle) and you will stay immersed the entire time, until combat. The characters you find are cool and you will actually get a connection, they put more time into dialogue and characters rather than combat and it payed off, there isn't very much fighting and more talking which is great. The decisions you make actually hurt you and when you  get one of them killed you will feel like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for leaving them to die .\n9/10\n\nEnviroments\nThey put a lot of detail into the landscape and it is nice, I am not fond of using the rover though it feels clunky.

Well, at least to someone who read anything in his life beyond pornographic fan-fics and pretentious novels of 2000s. Unfortunately, the big chunk of post 2000 playerbase is made of the illitarate defined by the lowest possible denominator.\n\nMass Effect is a mediocre third person shooter with little character customization that offers 2 ways of playing the game. Shoot everything and shoot everything with space magic. Bare bones, if you add a typical HOT pop-a-mole combat philisophy implemented in this game, that doesn't even tries to cover (pathetic pun intended) itself.\n\nOne thing bugs me after my second playthrough. This game looks half-baked, or aborted in an early production phaze. There are parts of the game, where it seems that there was a creative spark somewhere, someone had a vision of a great s-f/space opera game, that wouldn't just make money, but will offer all s-f tropes and classics from all over in one place for everyone to enjoy. Then the writing started, art-direction department attempted to do something with style, aaaand... few weeks later they had to say "eh - ♥♥♥♥ it". And left the game with few interesting places to visit, few Codex (in-game lore encyclopedia) entries and a whole lot of filler content probably made by unexperienced interns. I do believe that most of the content in the game is a work of unexperienced hacks, just look at the Mako part of the game. I don't believe it would be passable even for a student. It boils down to disattachment between the lore part of the game, and the actual gameplay. The lore, places and characters are giving you a premise of varied experiences, but at the end of the game it all boils down to TPS action in a terribly designed locations. C&C boil down to occasional speech check (and since no one will play without these skills maxed out, everyone will get that option) that will end all filler quests non-violently with absolutely cringe-worthy dialogue lines. Just listen to the final dialogue with Saren. I couldn't help myself but laugh while listening to it. It's like taken straight from a terrible 10 years old s-f writer on the Internet. Just terrible.\n\nFor a buck it's worth checking out. Just prepare for some cringe-fest and a lot of autism-inducing activities.","December 26, 2015","true","21.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Unlike the other two games it actually felt like a sci-fi rather than a coated James Bond movie. Shame that Bioware ended up in EA's bed, because what could have followed this game could have been 10x better than what got produced.\n\nIf you're wondering why this game is better? Play it. I'll give you some hints\n\n1. It's actually an RPG - Something Bioware forgot in its sequels is giving the player choices that actually matter, in this you can truly feel like you're choosing your own path rather than having it forced on you\n\n2. The Reapers - At this point, we didn't know much about the reapers, but that's why they were such a great plot point: because they were mysterious. Perhaps it would have been better that way, keeping the player in the dark about them while fighting them. Mass Effect 2 kind of lost the feeling that the Reapers generated and by Mass Effect 3 they pretty much took a back seat the ♥♥♥♥ing Cerberus\n\n3. It gives you a villain to rally around - We all hated Saren, not because he was a bad character but because he was a bad guy, and he did that so well. Harbinger just assumed control of people, we had very little interaction with him.\n\n4. Feels like an actual epic sci fi - What the sequels tried to do and failed is to keep the story epic while making it also feel like a summer thriller... bad move. Mass Effect throws environments at you that are really alien, combined with its freaky techno music that haunts you to the core. Sure, you often get the generic mountain planets, but I think they managed to make it work somewhat, and on that note\n\n5. Exploration - I get it, this isn't the U.S.S. Enterprise, you're hunting a criminal, but that doesn't mean you can't have a look around while you're out and about. You get to read up on strange planets, (the galaxy map usage in this is better too), explore them in a hilariously buggy tank, and do whatever you want. They are empty, for the most part, but it still feels fun. ME2 kind of continued it, but the lack of vehicular exploratation (sans the hammer) really didn't give the same vibe. Don't get me started on resource hunting in ME3\n\nThere's a bunch of other stuff I didn't touch on. Is it perfect? Hell no, it definitely has flaws, but I rather would have seen them get fixed instead of axed in the second game. It's really quite sad.\n\n♥♥♥♥ you EA","October 19, 2015","true","351.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

It could have been a movie because the story is awesome! Even if you don't play games you can play this one on the easiest difficulty just for it's story-- well, if you like science fiction, that is... It's very addictive. It makes you want to see what's next. There is even a ton of information that you can learn about the game's  fantastic world. Lots of new technologies and species and stuff like that. There are three main combat styles that you can use-- weapons, "tech" abilities and "biotic" abilities, which are new ways to manipulate the matter and the energy, kind of like the Force in Star Wars. There are six classes that you can play and each one has its strengths, weaknesses and unique set of skills and you have to work together with your followers to beat every kind of enemy. Each one of your followers has their own personality and story and some of them even give you a small quest to play. Many times you will be given the chance to make a choice between two or more decisions to take, usually a "good" one and a "bad" one. You can be a "good guy" or a "bad guy". Well, not really a *bad* guy... You save the galaxy either way, you can just choose to do it the right way, or any way you like. Even when talking to a character you can choose a "good" polite response or a "bad" rude one. What i didn't like is that all the weapons and any kind of equipment look and function alike. Even their names are boring (for example Lancer III, Lancer IV, Avenger VIII, Avenger IX, etc...) It would have been a lot better if there were unique items with a unique way to function and even special abilities, like for example a "Prototype Alpha Bio-Blaster". Also the planets you can explore get a little boring after a while. Another thing i didn't like is that there is no stealth, so you always have to fight your enemies. Except of course if you talk them out of it-- there is a way to persuade other characters using "charm" or "intimidation". You could also find it a bit annoying that your enemies always repeat the same thing during a battle ("Enemy is everywhere!") and there are some technical problems too, but if you can overlook that, you have a damn good game with an excellent story that will bring you many hours of fun.","December 6, 2013","true","69.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Level up your party by gaining experience from quests, killing enemies or decrypting locked cases. You can spend talent points to upgrade your skills in firearms, combat armour, health, electronics and more.\n\nNegatives:\n\n- For an RPG it isn't the longest game, taking around 45-60 hours to finish. I explored a lot of the galaxies and the main questline is sort of short. I didn't see everything the game had to offer but for the most part I did.\n- Graphics are really dated for a game released in 2008. In comparison, the Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion which hit the market in 2006, looks far superior. Nevertheless, you'll get used to it the more you play.\n- Inventory system isn't streamlined and a bit clunky, room for improvement here.\n\nOverall Score: 8/10\n\nThere's something about Mass Effect that makes it a really intriguing RPG. It's approach is fresh, it stands out from the standard medieval style RPG's due to its futurisitc sci-fi outlook.
