Publicly, my old review was not agreed upon and I don't mind that. But that didn't even stop these devs from contacting me to let me know they're making changes and improvements, and even personally informing me of a new expansion coming. I'm definitely going to put this on my regular checklist of perpetually updated games.\n\nI may not enjoy the game like I do for others, but the developers are top notch - something you don't see more often enough with vidya these days. I hope you guys keep the professional attitude and personal touch in the future. It puts you way above a lot of other devs, and it's something we game enthusiasts really need.\n\nThanks, guys!

The game has come a long way, and even though it still has a long way to go, the journey has been a decent one. The Dev team has only four members working on the game and they work hard as they listen to the player's suggestions. The Fantastic Four have been working really hard to make this game better from the many suggestions that players have given them, and This can only get better from this point, fingers crossed.\n\nThe game ofcourse has some pros and cons so without further ado, lets get into them:\n\nPros:\n-Combat Feels similar to Total War; Units have formations and most have special abilities.\n-Heroes/Champions are characters that can be unlocked via cards or technology advancements\n-In game Crafting System that allows the player to choose which technology to research as they unlock features for their\nfavourite faction.\n-Three Diverse and interesting factions to choose from. From the Mighty Orcs to the Humble Elves. And if you want to\nspecialise in both offense and defense, Humans are the faction for you.\n-Base Building has a nice bit of Nostalgia embedded into it, as they are pleasantly similar to the awesome Age of\nEmpires\nresource collection/management system the games are so well known for; Has the feel of playing the classic AoE\ngames\n-Graphics are decent, but they're decent enough.\n-Dragons\n-Dwarves\n-Zombies rise as corpses are left to rot\n\nCons:\n-The game has some bugs but they're not really game-breaking, fixes are on the way!\n-At the moment, pvp is a possibility, but sometimes its difficult to find players because of the low player count. It'll only\nget better from here on, (fingers crossed)\n\nAnd that's about it!

I've played a few games over the years and I've never really felt inclined to write a review for any of them. Not for any particular reason, there just didn't seem a need.\n\nAs for this game...\n- Pretty soon after loading my first skirmish I was repeatedly offered potatoes by a shifty looking peasent. Built a barn, and decided to persue a chicken farming career. Orcs must have sniffed out the little cluckers or just decided to shaft me, either way they were at the front door.\n- Fought them off with some archers.\n- Decided to build on my chicken empire so I sent the potato man to discover the new world. The wolves got him before help could arrive.\n- Fought off a second attack from the orcs and paused for a moment to reflect on my avian industry. That when it happened: the bodies of my felled opposition, as well as some of my own men, rose from the ground and WENT STRAIGHT FOR MY BLOODY CHICKENS!!! I thought NONE OF THAT m8, you @&^%s!!!\n- Skewered the zombies, killed off the wolves, then returned with my army just in time to remember I'd left the front gate open and the orcs had finished off every single peasent in the place.\n\nLost the game...\n\nHad the most fun I've had in a video game in a very long time.\n\nChickenFarmingSimulator/10\n\nIn all seriousness, what's driving me to write this review is the dev team. I wanted to help out in my small way to support their work. I have never, in all honesty, seen one so intergrated with, or responsive to their community. Go read some of the other reviews if you don't believe me. There's a helpful reply to just about every negative review; that is rare, A+ customer service.\n\n\nGood work dev team.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Usako/recommended/253190/","Usako","Usagi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Usako/","1581 products in account","Kingdom Wars 2 Battles is a real time strategy game set in fictional world with medieval accents. The game plays as you would expect a game of this genre to but a few added mechanics and an online multiplayer mode keep things fresh for players. While this isn’t a genre I am very familiar with I did find the game enjoyable, it can easily be played for hours as you spend time focusing on micromanaging your units. The game offers single player and campaign modes if you just want to enjoy it on your own.\n\nThe story in the campaign mode focuses on the race of humans mainly fighting against orcs. Humanity is on the run from their aggressors, periodically making valiant stands to secure their survival. Each step of the story is told via cutscenes with voice over explaining the battle and what takes place before and after it. An interesting plot point in the game is the presence of zombies -the result of cannibalism, no doubt committed by desperate war-refugees. The story itself is currently one episode with five chapters.\n\nThe game’s mechanics work very well, while I mainly played the campaign mode I also found that the multiplayer mode was a fun option for those wanting to increase the game’s replay value. The game also has a great single player mode where you can play your own adventure or a survival mode. All units in the game are under your control, even down to farm animals. The worker class mines, farms and builds while fighters help protect and progress. Both classes are important to the game as is resource and time management. The game works best with a keyboard and mouse requiring both to control the camera and click on areas of interest. Each unit and building have a large variety of actions and options available to players that help to customize gameplay experiences.\n\nThe graphics in the game are simple, and even a bit dated. Character models are basic and not overly-detailed and I found some of the buildings hard to tell apart visually. Maps are also standard, nothing is bad but nothing really stands out much either. I found it a little hard to tell the tiny units on the map apart as their uniform colors were often the same. The audio in the game is fine, the characters talk when you click on them and there is some voice over as well. The music is fitting, but not memorable.\n\nI found the game to be a good way for novices such as myself to learn about real time strategy, or fans who haven’t played a game in the genre for a while. Kingdom Wars 2 Battles offers a lot of options and customizing choices to tailor gameplay to each person as well as three different races to choose from; humans, orcs and elves. No matter what option you pick the game will be fun and challenging, plus there are trading card and achievements to keep a person coming back for more. With a hands-on development team regularly updating the game, this title is a great addition to any library.\n\nThis review is exclusively written for Y.A - Yolo Army, follow the group's curations here!","April 17","true","7.9"," 36 of 40 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","36","40","2","0"

I have played a large amount of RTS such as Sins of a Solar Empire, Age of Empires, Total War, and Star Wars: Empire at War, and various others.\n\nYet none of the above gave quite the satisfaction that Kingdom Wars 2: Battles does, and that is not due to cheap gimmicks or repetitive game play.\n\nJust to give a brief bullet point list of some of the features that I find quite enjoyable:\n\n- Faction Diversity\n- Unit Specialization\n- Fire, lots of fire\n- Size of maps allow many forms of combat\n- Zombies\n- Unit Diversity\n\nNow, to go over each piece individually.\n\nFaction Diversity\nEach faction quite simply plays very different from each other, and while there is a slight bit of overlap, as there is in every RTS, each have their own tricks and techniques to master. For example, the Orc Faction has the highest number of soldiers per unit as well as the ability to mass produce weak units such as goblins, which can win wars of attrition if you play your cards right. On the other hand, the Human Faction has some of the tankiest units in the game but is more of a balance between Elves and Orcs than anything else. Other than their durability, their units do not stick out too much, but it is quite pivotal if you are able to compound on such. Finally, the Elves, have the lowest soldiers per unit, but also have the highest quality of units, which allow them to defeat superior numbers more often than not. Despite all of this though, each faction has balanced counters and maneuvers to use against each other, with no one strategy being undefeatable. For each move, there is a counter move, for every counter move there is another counter. In essence, balance is maintained for the most part, with no one Faction getting too far ahead of the others. Each can be phenomenal in the right player’s hands.\n\nUnit Specialization\nQuite simple really, but each unit has 'levels' that they achieve when they have gained enough experience from combat. This in turn, allows you to distribute stats for that unit as you see fit, meaning that a full blown army can be as unique as you deem fit. It could be as simple as maxing out the defensive stats, or going for full out mobility... Yet each is viable in different situations, with no one configuration being the end all be all. Diversity is the word of the game.\n\nFire\nThis one is much simpler than the previous item, in that it is quite self-explanatory. Archers and siege equipment can make use of fire to damage buildings, do extra damage to units, or even light the battle field itself on fire. In short, just as in real life, fire is one hell of a weapon.\n\nMap Size\nThere are four castle plots, one taken by each player unless there are less than four of course. Each one is in a corner of the map, with defensible positions dotted all over the place, including bridges, ruins, quarries, and npc forts. The time it takes to travel across the map isn't too long, but just long enough to make you think before emptying your garrison. Caught without an army at home, you will suffer the consequences.\n\nZombies\nA relatively new addition, these buggers form up large hordes outside your castle and in essence prolong the game unless you can circumvent them. You used to be able to direct them against your opponents with clever sacrifice of units, but they are more a field threat these days. Every unit that dies and is not looted... Well... Expect to see them again. Not only does this add some threat to the general map to consider when moving about, but it also being key to use scouts to avoid them or funnel enemies towards them. While they are destructible, they can still wreak quite a bit of havoc before being put down.\n\nUnit Diversity\nEach Faction has some basic units similar to another, but even then, each have their own defining characteristics. Take spearmen for example, orcs have Impalers, elves Sentries, and humans Halberdiers. The Halberdiers lack special abilities, but have higher base stats and are able to cut down monsters and Calvary quite efficiently. Impalers on the other hand are slow and lower damage, as well as health, but have an AoE ability that can one shot a large charging Calvary force, as well as stun them, not to mention it works decently against other infantry as well. Sentries on the other hand have a stun ability, which allows them to combat Calvary and monsters while taking little damage. What we have here, are three different units designed for the same task, yet go about doing it in completely different ways. Nor are they only type to have such differences.\n\n\nIn short, KW2 is a great RTS that gets you in the action, gives you the tools to create the army you always dreamed of commanding, and to proceed however you want. Want stealth based combat? Elves have plenty of that, and the Orc's Goblins can do such as well. Want to take a tanky approach? All three have their own methods, such as Slayers, Knights, and Grandmasters. Archers? Most definitely. Another interesting thing, is the siege equipment... But I might as well not spoil it for those who have not played yet, but suffice to say, they can be used in a variety of situations.\n\nDon't believe me on half of what I said? Try it for yourself, and you are sure to find something you enjoy here.\n\nSincerely, The Goblin King","July 17, 2015","true","76.1"," 31 of 34 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","31","34","0","1"

They are best at early game.\nElves-Once you play them it seems tricky but youll get use to it,With there stealth you can sneak capture towns.\n\nFor feedback to the DEVS for a small team they deserve many cookies. I suggest making a new race (Dwarfs) like we all wanted in kingdom wars 1 the dwarfs would be master at defense then the humans at the best health but the slowest units and lesser damage. They would be the slowest race to build up their Econmy due to there advantages in defense. There main resource is stone. This is just a fan suggestion of mine but i could see adding the dwarf as a race could cause a promblem due to the the dwarfs being used by other races currently. But as i seen most people dont really use them.\n\nAs I said keep on doing what your doing DEVS the game is great but can be even greater (New race c;).

It takes mechanics from all over, with resource nodes from games like age of empires or empire earth; huge scale combat from the total war games including the batallions of x amount of units per squad. It's so nostalgic and at the same time thrilling to play a game like this. As much as I'd like to praise it up to the stars and call it the new messiah, I can't do that fairly. So let's look at some of the negatives I've noticed during gameplay.\n- Archers: These guys are useful, but good god can they not aim at times. If you stick them on a wall, sure they'll aim as well as they can, but when you have about 3 orcish marauders (orc archers) left in a squad firing at your 5 squads on a wall, and killing them like flies while hundreds of arrows rain down upon the orcish invaders, and not a single one is hitting them, it's a little bit ♥♥♥♥♥♥. It's not even a case of them having godly luck by dodging, the archers just don't aim at them. They aim a bit to the left, or a bit to the right, and every single arrow aims in that spot instead of where the enemy is actually standing! It's infuriating! The siege is the same too, missing countless shots and wasting ammunition to try and flatten the ground next to the invader. AGH!\n- Terrain: This is a little bugbear of mine, but it still counts in this. On some maps you play singleplayer, I've found that if I try to play humans, and have stone walls defending the core of my city, I can't place anyone on the outer layer. By outer layer I mean the humans have a kind of bastion style design. If intruders break through the outer walls, they have to break through the inner gates. But the inner gates are broken into two parts. I won't fully explain it since I'd sound like an utter ♥♥♥♥♥ trying to explain something I don't know about, but look it up. I'm sure there are a few images flying around of the human castles by now.\n- Balance: As of the current release of the game, I've found that the elves are insanely overpowered. Now, in a lot of games I've played over the years, elves can be quite dangerous, but if you try enough, they'll fall over flat on their pretty little faces. In this game? Good god. They're the same as all others, don't get me wrong. Push enough and they'll still die. But in terms of resources, they will outlast you. How? They get a building called a symbiosis tree, which allows them to CREATE resources. Yup, I really mean that. They can create gold mines, stone mines, even more berries if they so fancy. This means they can keep pumping out entire armies of powerful troops, while you're scrounging around the map desperately trying to find some gold for another squad of knights.\n- Walls: Useful, correct? well, not when the wall is blocking all your arrows trying to murder a single zombie battering down your damn gate, and you can't open that gate because the zombie is hitting it. Infuriating, especially as an orc, since you only get one exit out of your plateau. Truly infuriating. It's made even worse when you watch your archers arrows hit thin air way above the barricades and the enemy on the other side is perfectly safe. Worst bugbear ever.\n\nNow, I know that a lot of these problems should be solved during the next couple updates, and admittedly they'll take a while. I'm an impatient person so I want them as soon as possible, so I can enjoy this game even more. But on the whole, for the feel this game gives you when you play this, it's totally worth it in my opinion. Especially for the price right now. £10.99? I'd pay £20 for this game, just because it's brilliant, and brings back the main thing I love in games like this; strategic options. Rush them, or defend. It's your choice.","July 12, 2015","true","18.7"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","23","25","0","0"

It's been a very long time since we have another good medieval RTS, I can't remember the last good one released in recent years. All we have these days are those futuristic ones with guns and mechs yawn...\n\nThen I stumbled upon this game.\n\n+ Beautiful graphics. Nothing outstanding for 2015 but for a RTS game it still looks very good.\n+ The three factions in this game are very different from each other. Can we have more factions though? Why every RTS game these days has exactly 3 factions? I know it's quality over quantity but still!\n+ Great wall defense mechanics. Pouring oil down to the invaders!\n+ Fire arrows. Archers in this game have much more impact than just being some low-HP fire support.\n+ After a battle, you can send peasants to loot corpses for gold and wood. Nice.\n+ Interesting crafting system, with different cards for different factions.\n+ Good price for a game like this. Look up other recently released RTS games on Steam, they are very overpriced despite just being clones of Starcraft, C&C etc.\n\n- Variety of buildings and units, hope more will get added.\n- Not really a fan of the zombies. More polishing would make this a + instead of a - though.\n- Bugs & optimization, but not really a con here since the game is still in early access.\n\nI'm excited to see new patches and content added to this game.\nAs of right now I cannot not consider this one of the great medieval RTS games yet, but lots of potential here, don't screw it up guys.\n\n8/10","September 18, 2015","true","3.3"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","22","24","0","6"

For now I can barely play hardly an hour. Trust me, if you are an RTS lover, this game is not. worth. 20 dollars. I promise you. I can barely play more than an hour and I will try to give you a short review on why it's not worth your time:\n\nCons:\n-Very clunky main menu screen\n-Text is hard to read and you can't increase or decrease the size because then it will disappear\n-There is like, NO AA on the menu screen so everything is hard to look at. (texts are very jagged and it's headache-inducing to try and craft cards)\n-If you're used to most RTS games, building in this game is weirdly confusing, but I think it can be overlooked if they patched the game up some more. Obviously they're trying new techniques that's completely different from building in Age of Empires, as an example.\n-Voice acting\n-No immersion, and definitely not addictive or satisfying when it comes to RTS games.\n-Not quite optimized, I sadly can't even do the storymode because of extreme lag (yet when I play singleplayer, it's just fine)\n-A voice that constantly tells you that you have idle workers (not sure if you can turn this off yet)\n\nPros:\n-Good music!\n-Obviously they care about their own lore and storytelling, you easily get this with how they simply give their inhuman races their snippets of their own languages\n-Each race is completely different\n-Cards: something I've never done in an RTS. Basically they're like buffs that you craft before you play a game that gives you an advantage on a map. It's pretty clever\n-Good maps, they look pretty and there's a good selection of them so far\n-Nice visuals for an RTS\n-If you're into the high fantasy scene, it's a good way to feel a little nostalgia from the old Warcraft days\n\nI actually do not recommend this game to play, but to help fund the studio to make this game better because it has obvious potential. This is one reason I hope Early Access Games will stop being a thing and gaming studios will focus on the content of their game rather than pushing it out as fast as they can as an unfinished piece.","May 11, 2015","false","0.5"," 69 of 109 people (63%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","63","69","109","4","7"

The single player is lacking, Needs a proper skirmish mode. Hopefully we get one. Other then that its similar to stronghold crusader, but with fantasy elements similiar to lord of the rings. Are the graphics amazing? no, not really, but its fun and its not taking itself too seriously. I play total war games when i want complete realism on the battlefield. The game is large scale, and i cant stress enough, just fun. You start with a town or whatever from which you build peasents. 1 squad of peasents is like 15 guys. So you build some squads and then you task them out to do things like..work mines for stone, kill pigs for food, loot corpses for gold and stuff, etc etc you get the idea. Each race is different, for example the elves do not chop down trees like humans  do. they are nature lovers or whatever so, they work with the earth.  You build houses to increase population cap. Each house adds 10 squads, each squad can have 15ish men in them. I dont know the max population...i havent hit one yet. But you can see from the video up top on the store page that the battles can be big. Theres upgrades and tech trees, things mostly make sense, like if you have catapults on your wall, they fire stones but in doing so they deplete them from your stock pile. Makes sense to me, Stones arent infinite and free to just toss around.  Theres alot of detail in the maps, The huge cities and towns are really pretty and well thought out. In closing....I dont know how popular this game is, there are clearly more of them, and this is the most recent, but i had never heard of these games before this one. so i cant compare the rest or anything, but man i feel like i stumbled across a little gem. This is true old school rts. Build a barracks get infantry. I compare this most with the lord of the rings rts battle for middle earth. Basically if Battle for middle earth and stronghold had a baby, this would be its offspring. Also reminds me ALOT of warcraft 3 so maybe battle for middle earth cheated with warcraft 3, and stronghold never found out, so stronghold helped raise the kid as his own.

(You can turn off the zombies if you don't like them.) The game is basically any other Medieval RTS title, but has zombies! You fortify your castle and upgrade units and structures, there's a whole crafting system in this game, which is weird, but kinda cool. For most new players, like myself it took a few games to realize that I had to craft upgrades from the main menu to actually use them in game. But once I figured it out, the game really came to life.\n\nBasically how it works: You play campaign/multiplayer/singleplayer vs AI. Once you have played a few games, you will get these special resources, now I don't know how to actually acquire them, but it seems like the more games you play, the more you get. Anyway so once you have these resources you can craft certain upgrades that can be used in game. (For the Humans, Halberdier for example.) And after you craft the upgrade you can use it in game. Pretty cool stuff.\n\nAll in all this game is pretty awesome. I mean it needs some more refining, and at random times may crash. (Save Often!!!!) It'll get framy and just gucky, so be prepared to have it crash, also sometimes your units won't respond to orders, I've noticed if you stop moving the screen and click it usually works. lol other than that this game is a diamond in the rough, totally worth the money if you wanna support the devs. It's really fun in the state that it's in.

In the campaign mode, you will be playing four episodes at this stage (the fifth episode is coming soon), you will be treated with very good cinematics as well as an in-depth story line. This episode with be all about the last stronghold for the human race, the city of “Dagbor.” You will be playing the Humans and then the Orcs. During the gameplay, you will have to achieve all tasks before entering a battle. Essentially, it is like a very good tutorial. You will learn how to gather resources, create buildings and units.\n\nThe single player mode is realistically a skirmish; choose your race and up to three others players (AI) to fight against. In the survival mode, you will be fighting against waves of zombies.\n\nThere is quite a lot of content here. There is a technology tree for the 3 races and you can unlock upgrade with different resources. If you are missing some, head up to the trade centre and buy what you need from another user. By clicking on the social icon, you will be able to see who is online, become a friend with whoever you want, challenge or engage in a co-op game.\n\nStrategic cards can be crafted and used in a multiplayer game. Select a combination of cards to have the edge against your opponent but be aware, they might have a better combination than you.\n\nThe gameplay is good, as are the graphics, although I did experience a couple of flicking screen effects here and there.\n\nThe controls are easy to master and follow the trend of this type of game. The only negative here is that I had to click several times to the same points for my units to acknowledge my command, and this can be frustrating.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Good graphics\n-	Good story and cinematics\n-	3 races to play with each their specific tech tree\n-	Achievements and Trading cards\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Controls could be more responsive\n\nI really like RTS and Kingdom War 2: Battles show great potential.\n\n7.5/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

Although I’ve spent four hours playing the game I can already foreshadow that this is the type of game that you could easily sink hundreds of hours in. There are five full campaigns and that’s without even considering the multiplayer. As of writing there are well over one hundred players playing and the in game chat system was vibrant and active so finding a match shouldn’t be a problem for some time.\n\nOne of the best things about the game is that there are three playable races. However, unlike a number of other games where each race feels very much alike even though units and buildings may be given different names the play styles of each race feel very different from one another. If not for the graphics then at times you would have a hard time believing that you were playing the same game which is a real boon for a genre where variety can be an important selling point. Another strength of the three race system in this game is that – at least in my experience – none of the races play over or underpowered when compared to the other. Certainly there may be a race that plays to your own individual strengths or against your weaknesses but it is a game where putting in the time to learn to master one or more will give you an advantage in the multiplayer.\n\nThere are some weaknesses to the game. My biggest one would be the graphics. The UI, because of the graphics, needs a fair amount of work but I’m not entirely certain as to how I would go to polish it but I do know that it needs work from its present state. At times the screen can be too busy and I found it difficult in these times to know which units – peasants – weren’t being busy. This is especially apparent on the tutorial level where there are just so many different units that bombard you that you can lose track of what is happening all too quickly. I know that I wasn’t the first player to lose at the tutorial level and have this complaint. There are also some bugs that continue to remain in the game. However, to be very fair to the developers, they’ve been great and are removing them from the game at a rapid pace and this has been the case throughout the entirety of the development process.\n\nHowever, the tutorial level – even if you include the fact that there is a little bit too much going on – is one of the better ones that I’ve played. It’s a welcome introduction to the challenge that you will be experiencing throughout the game. This isn’t a walk in the park regardless of the level of difficulty that you play on and that is as it should be. Some players may well be frustrated at just how tough the challenge can be but if you’re wanting an engaging and challenging game in this genre then you’ve found it.\n\nMy favorite aspect of the game is the fantastic skirmish gameplay. This is genuinely the type of game that I would recommend to those who loved the original Warcraft games as well as those of you who play Rise of Nations and other similar games. You’ll be surprised at just how much depth there is to your city/base building while also at the same time how strategically you must be in designing the type of armies that will enable you to be successful. Players of both types of games will be at a distinct advantage as you utilize a combination of the skills throughout the campaign and multiplayer modes.\n\nThere is a ton to like about Kingdom Wars 2: Battles. There is potential for the title to become even better. The devs have been great and if they continue working on the title then it could become a classic. If you already own the game thanks to the Damnation Bundle from Bundle Stars or the Be Mine 21 bundle from Groupees then get on board and play it. If not and you’re a fan of the game then you really owe it to yourself to check it out if not right away then when it goes on sale.\n\nFor our popular daily giveaways and similar reviews head over to http://www.steamified.com/\n\nTo begin your journey through our myriad of social media join our Steam Group","March 16","true","6.7"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","16","19","0","0"

In the weekend following its purchase iv logged just under 30h. I played abit of the campaign, Multiplayer, Survival and skirmish. Out of all the modes Survival is my favorite.\n\nPROS\n\n- The amount of Units one can sustain on the battlefield rivals TA (Total Annihliation) and TW (All Total Wars)\n\n- The combat mechanics, Siege mechanics are fantastic\n\n- 3 Unique races all with their own spin\n\n- THE SCALE!\n\n- The Maps (though id like more)\n\n- The graphics are slightly above average but leave lots to be desired\n\n- Army customization via personnel armors, weapon upgrades and health/Regen ect ect.\n\n- Seperate tech tree for each faction\n\n- Unique card system for enhanced starts\n\n- Guilds/friends list/trading system\n\n- Low PC demands given the sheer scale\n\n- Trial by fire\n\nCONS (most being adressed ASAP)\n\n- Poor unit pathing Warriors and Peasents alike (especially for wood)\n\n- Alot of missing content for a Final Beta release\n\n- AI even on easy starts with near infinite resources forcing a turtle everytime (very hard)\n\n- Exploitable Race mechanic (The orcs are the only ones i know of)\n\n- HUD lacking important info\n\n- Unit huds lacking important info\n\n- Bugs and crashes (not unplayable at all)\n\n- Only one way to build a fortress for each faction (could use different keep and fortress layouts, dont confuse this with building stuff, this only affects where walls can be built)\n\n- Lacking a real tutorial besides the campaign, especially for combat/ damage types\n\n- Zombie glitches/bugs\n\nCONCLUSION\nBuilt an army to lend AID to my survival partner.

The battles are intense and the strategy is unlike most other simulations out there so most players can expect a challenging experience unlike any they have faced before. That is, unless you happened to play the original Kingdom Wars. What gives this series its unique flavor is Reverie World Studios, INC's strong focus on siege warfare, making it unlike anything else being developed.\n\nPlayers will naturally need to gather resources, build structures, research technologies, and train armies just like in most other RTS sims of this nature. However, the economy and techs have all been streamlined so the player doesn't have to micro-manage their progression and can devote most of their attention to the battles themselves. Currently there are three races to choose from: Humans, Elves, and Orcs. Each race has its own unique units, structures and styles. Since the game is still Early Access, its possible that more will be added later but I cannot say for certain.\n\nPlayers can choose between single-player story mode played out in episodes, skirmish mode, and Multiplayer mode. There is only one episode available now but current plans include five in total and these additional episodes will be released as Free DLC's. Other features in the works include a crafting system based on rewards earned during battles for a variety of advancements, an intricate card system used for powerful bonuses during games, a trading market where players can trade crafting items with other players, and a guild system that will allow players to create or join a battle clan for shared strength. At this time, some of these things are still in development so its not easy to elaborate on them, but they sound pretty cool.\n\nThe graphics are very rich but older systems struggle to keep up on moderately high settings so this may change in order to accommodate more players, especially for Multiplayer PvP. There is an in-game chat system so players can communicate during gameplay without the hassles of using the Steam overlay. A level editor is included for the mod community can get a jumpstart on their own creations. The sound effects are a bit troublesome currently and being sorted out. Nothing new for an Alpha version though. Also, there are still a number of bugs scattered about so don't be alarmed. This is typical of an Early Access game and the devs welcome any information on them so they can work to correct the problems. Still, the game is very stable and entertaining. Being part of the Early Access phase gives players the opportunity to help shape the future of KW2B and help the developers build the best game possible. However, if you're one of those gamers who has little patience or prefers only finished/polished projects, then i suggest holding off a while longer. Unhappy gamers do nothing to help the community, the developers, or the game.\n\nThe Good:\n=======+  Solid graphics and detailed artwork\n+  Three fully unique races\n+  Various player modes for added replay value\n+  Crafting and Card systems for player bonuses\n+  Fully rotating camera with smooth controls\n+  In-game chat system\n+  Steam Achievements & Trading Cards\n+  Level Editor included for the Workshop\n+  Active & friendly game devs\n+  Free DLC's\n+  More cool features being added\n\nThe Bad:\n======-  Still has a lot of bugs to be worked out (typical for Early Access)\n-  Audio is a mess right now\n-  User Interface and layout still needs some work\n-  Many features and elements are missing (still under development)\n-  Graphics are a strain on older systems\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n===========KW2B has all the promise of a great game and I have no doubt the developers will see this game all the way through to a polished gem. Siege warfare is often a neglected aspect of RTS strategy sims and its rarely done properly so this game offers a fresh experience for most players. Strategy players will definitely want to grab a copy and strap in for battle. This game isn't the best choice for impatient people or those who expect to have a smooth and complete experience since its still Early Access Alpha though.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","May 12, 2015","true","17.5"," 30 of 45 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","30","45","2","2"

One look at this though, mostly because of the price difference, made me have a look at this game instead. And I don't regret it one bit!\n\nThe first thing I noticed that made this game a winner was the world chat. Basically, no matter if you are in the main menu, campaign, singleplayer or multiplayer, you are always able to speak with everyone else currently online. This is HUGE in my honest opinion, and it makes it way easier to get in touch with the devs too, since they are often in the world chat.\n\nFeatures:\nThis game has crafting as a part of its learning process. This means you are not spammed with too many decisions in your first few games, and if you take the time to craft exactly what you want, the new buildings or units you can get in your next games won't feel so alien.\n\nYou also get to craft cards, which when activated gives you a small boost in your current games. These cards must be recrafted every 4 times you use them, but you get the resources to do so every game, so it's not such a big deal.\n\nGuilds also exist in these games, with ratings for all the guilds, so you can fight together with your friends in rated games for ultimate glory.\n\nGameplay:\nThis game has everything I'm looking for in an RTS: Fast-paced combat, a managable start (unlike Age of Empires or Starcraft, where you have to sit with your hotkey fingers ready for the first second), castle defending and attacking, and a massive zombie feature that lets you suicide bomb your army outside your enemies' base and turn them into zombies.\n\nThis game has benefits for focusing on defense as well as offense, and if you can defend yourself against the first wave without taking too much losses, your units will level up from it, becoming stronger and stronger. This is when you can launch a counter-assault, sending your elite units on your opponent and decimating their defenses.\n\nYou start with your very own fortress with walls, and you can build additional sets of walls and upgrade them to stone structures with enough resources. You can put archer units on the walls, and also build towers or anti-siege equipment to make it harder to penetrate your defenses. Boiling oil pots and trebuchets give you the ability to kill siege units that are below your gates and far away, and your archers can perform volleys of arrows that decimate those who are stranding still too close to your walls.\n\nThere are some issues with the game still, like the sound is a bit loud some places (so you might want to turn down your volume once ingame), and your units not moving when you tell them to sometimes. All of this is being worked at however, so I'm not worried. It's still the most fun RTS I've played in forever.\n\nYou should buy this if you enjoy massive army combat, units that can level up in many different ways, and zombies. Lots and lots of zombies.","March 12","true","348.6"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","12","13","2","0"

I'll be judging it as if it was a finished project so anything that ends up being ironed out when you read this may no longer be applicable.\n\nThe game features the standard 3 factions, a faction with expensive troops, a faction with tankish troops, and a faction with cheap troops, however each faction works in very unique ways such as how they gather their resources and how they build their armies, which is a neat thing to see in an RTS.\n\nAs far as combat goes, there's no collision between units, so its impossible to hold off a group of enemies without a closed gate. resource management seems fine, though managing all your peasants and keeping track of your troops can be difficult. Kingdom wars 2 is also the first RTS I've seen to feature zombification as a mechanic, and its more or less clunky, it really just makes sieges more of a hassle and slows the game down, but it has its high moments, there's a lot tension when a massive army of your troops or an enemy's army has been defeated near something important, and you need to clear the area of corpses before either: your enemy arrives again or the sun sets.\n\nThe strategy side of this game seems fairly weak, though it could just be that the game is new and there isn't a community cooking up the best ways to win at everything, but it seems to me that all it takes at the moment is a massive horde of your weakest non-peasant troops and a couple battering rams, since again, you don't have to kill your enemies, you just have to touch their flag for 30 seconds or something.\n\nThen there's presentation, The game seems riddled with glitchs, and is poorly optimized, expect constant lag in both single player and pvp. Also, there seems to be a bug that causes all gui's relating to buildings and units to simply not appear, meaning it can suddenly become impossible for you to build any more troops or buildings.\n\nIn conclusion, yes the game is in early access, but that still doesn't mean it isn't broken, I'd normally say thats enough for me to not reccomend it, however updates are fairly often, and the devs do seem very invested in the community around this game, so I'm actually going to go ahead and recommend you support them... for now.","September 23, 2015","true","130.0"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","3"

Suddenly you have this nostalgia of old games with modern mechanics and it really is fantastic.\n\nOne of my favourite features - zombie survival in an RTS! You have a castle like a normal game but you're tasked with surviving wave after wave and this can be done cooperatively!

After 1.17 patch, lot of things changed, got improved and overall it's really big step for KW forward.\nGameplay is very enjoyable with 3 factions, with unique tactics and way how to play them. You can also upgrade each of them and get some more buildings, units, upgrades etc., permanently, which is at least from me, interesting system that rewards players for playing.\nSiege can get quiet hectic with all these units running around, arrows, rocks etc. flying around, and multiple ways how to approach them, so they are definitely fun.\nSo far I am enjoying this game, since it has really a lot of potential, and hopefully it will stay that way. If you are not sure if you would like this kind of game, go ahead and try KW 1, since it is free to play right now.\nAnyway, good job Reverie and keep it up!","October 7, 2015","true","15.4"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

Also the first few campaign missions gave a nice introduction to the future of this game.\n\nThere is indeed only one thing I can really complain about at this very moment: The game is still unfinished - that needs to be changed ASAP.\n\n\nImaginary Rating: 8.2/10","May 18, 2015","true","1.8"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

Ah yes. KW2B has honestly astounded me, for being a new release it is very well done and the Dev's are on point with support and patches. The gameplay merges with the large openness of the game quite beautifully. The massive armies of siegeness to the simple raids of infantry, it also comes together nicely and keeps you on your toes. The complexity of managing an attack force, a defense and your economy puts players at their best. Combine that with the possibility of "Oh No!" of a zombie attack for not cleaning the army you have just successfully wiped out makes it a challenge. The races are well done, all balanced to eachother and the tech trees giving you an edge over your opponent make it wonderful to build your own strategies. The campaign is so well in depth and fun to play, the problem is waiting for the next Act/Chapter, whatever you feel the need to call it.

RTS games have been a dying breed after Warcraft 3 was released and the way of the fps arose like the zombies do as in it's totally awesome yet you still wish it would just die. There is only one other game that the conscept of zombies rising from the dead of the resent conflict, Army Men franchise again another rts master peice. It has always been an interesting extra threat to an RTS one that is alway fun. This begining said I was hoping for a similar to the originals mmo like "World" to have zombies as well they should look into  such a thing but in general with Total War fighting for survival as the only quality RTS game around anymore let us pray that Kingdom Wars can aid in the return of the RTS genere\n\noverall across lifespan of game(s) in series (8/10\n\nInivative Ideas Across Existing Titles in Series 7.5/10\n\nGameplay of KW2 7/10\n\nSo the ideas that are coming from this game are not 100% new but they are either often poorly exicuted or just plum unexplored such as RTS zombie hazard or the MMORTS\n\nKingdom Wars has largely adress the major problem mmorts games face how not to be P2W and how to keep contrution and training times to be more normal for RTS games in general, This is a huge strength as an mmorts\n\nKW2 has an interesting Card mechanic as well as a zombie hazard, though it has in some ways dailed back though it is nice to be able to play a story campain and other things to do without being online\n\nThe there is the game world itself all I can say "What will befall the realm of Mythador next what apycolyptic event is in store next of the world that seems to taken a plunge into the unfathomable depths of what seems to be the inevitable dying throws of all of Mythador?

(and Rome Total war has a very bad engine and I can run it fine in large scale batles) But in this game whenever I build more than 5 units the game starts dropping frames.\n\n\nAND NOW! unto the Pros:\nThis game is so much fun! I want to play this more then I do right now (but for certain problems with the game I cant) one thing I love the most about this game is that there is a Zombie mode (survival mode). But with the Zombie/Survival mode comes a WHOLE BUNCH! Of problem that I am not going to include in this. for the most part the game runs fine and the battle are amazing, I love the way that the seiges take place, team Green sets up his massive force to assualt team Yellow and then all of a sudden team Purple swoops in from behind and starts attacking team Green, Green team then calls for the aid of their temporary allies the Brown team to aid them in this massive battle taking place over at the Purple Teams city. this happened to me and it was amazing to see this battle play out (even though I was Yellow, I was seiged and defending for the most part) in the end Yellow team pushed Purple, Green AND Brown out of his city and then procededs to seige and defeat Brown and Purple teams, just before Yellow team gets seiged again by team Green! (in the end I lost, I ddint have enough recourses becuase they were all gone and my market would not give me any gold for all the meat I was trying to give it, so in the end I lost becuase I could not defend my walls)\n\n\n\nOverall this game in its current state is a 7/10\nmaybe in the future it can go beyond that but for not it doesnt seem like it, and also if they do not fix the bugs and quirks happening throught this, my rating for this game would drop to a 4/10.

The gameplay of the elves is so different from that of the orcs you would think you're playing a different game!\n\n- very interesting siege defense and battles. There are very few AOE style RTS games out there that ♥♥♥♥ such an emphasis on siege elements, and this game does it quite well. Both defending your forts and laying siege on the enemy ones feel exhilarating.\n\nCons\nNote that this game is still in early access stage. I assume and hope that some of the issues below will be fixed/improved. But it is always possible that they won't be. So I think people wanting to try the game should know about them.\n\n- this likely will stay, but it's not too much of an issue for me. The graphics is quite outdated for a 2015 game, even with everything on the highest quality. But for an indie game it's really not bad at all.\n\n- the most serious problem is the constant crashing. 9/10 skirmishes i played ended up CTD. The official solutions did not work. And that's when i have a good rig i7 + gtx 980 ti\n\n- some of the useful features that are omnipresent in RTS games are missing. E.g the game wont automatically redirect to  a unit after you press the number they are tied to, nor are they shown in a specific color on the minimap to tell you where they are.\n\n- your units can be pretty unresponsive to your commands.\n\nAll in all it is a very fun game.

Not to mention, the developers are also totally in contact with the community. I oppened up the game after downloading it and the first thing I see is the global chat and the Devs talking to the players. In my opinion, that is one of the BEST features. There are also many other game modes such as Zombie Survival, PVP, and PVE. However, new players will want to start with the campaign since it teaches the basics of the game. If you have any questions (as I did), just ask the amazing community of the game in the chat.

It is an incredibly RTS game, kind of reminds me of Battle for Middle-earth 2 and Age of Empires... With Zombies. But it still has issues. The controls aren't very responsive (I play a lot of Starcraft 2, and that one is very very responsive). Sometimes I have to click 2 or 3 times in order to move a unit and there is no attack-move function (or if there is, I don't know how it works).\nAnd then there is the biggest problem I have ever faced with an RTS game: SYNCRONISATION! I've played with a friend a couple of times, and the game was never in sync. He was doing something I didn't see, so that wasn't happening on my screen. He told me he was at my base but I couldn't see it, and the other way around.

The music, for example, constantly resets itself to the default setting after it loops forcing you to go into the options menu every few minutes to turn it down/off.  While there is a single player campaign, there is no save feature at present.  This is unfortunate, considering that the game crashed after 20 minutes of playing the first level with no way to recover it.  I like the ideas it brings to the table: craft-able cards, researching permanent tech upgrades...sort of reminds me of "Age of Empires Online" that way.  The developers have also proven through their first game that they have no problem with releasing free DLC/add-ons and responding to the community.  To that end, I'd say pick this up if you don't mind the bugs (buildings disappearing, etc.) and lack of a save feature...otherwise, wait a while until the game becomes a bit more polished.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-iib9x9hm0\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OaWNfvETM0","April 12, 2015","true","3.6"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","14","22","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yuinori/recommended/253190/","Yuinori","Lord Frieza","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Yuinori/","193 products in account","This is a fairly fresh approach to the RTS genre, it throws in a few things which just make the game so much more enjoyable.\nIt seems to take a few ideas from games such as AOE III, and by that I mean you can use cards during the game for extra resources, a few troops etc, only difference being you will have to craft these cards.\nYou also have to play the game through a bit before fully unlocking all units and benefits within, as you receive materials for finishing matches which can then be used to craft new techs.\n\nGameplay is pretty standard RTS, with a few suprises which keep you on your feet. Your base will fortify itself by upgrades, and (this is one of my favourite things in an RTS) you can position your archers on your walls to defend from invaders. There are scattered benefits around the map, such as extra resource deposits for your workers to mine, gold carts (defended by packs of wolves usually), and small forts (defended by bandits) which are good for strategic positions.\nThe main thing I love about this game, which had me and a friend thoroughly entertained, was that your (and your allies/enemies) troops don't stay dead.. They will rise again as zombies, and at night are even worse to deal with. Essentially, even if you win a fight against your opposition, you'd best get your troops far away from there, or at least hope to god that that fight didn't take place near your base. The zombies swarm, you fight them off with troops and lose more, they gain more zombies, it becomes a losing battle fast.\n\nThere is also a survival gamemode, in which you (and allies) defend your bases against zombie hordes. It seems like a normal gamemode, except instead of fortresses they have cemeteries spawning zombies at increasing rates every round. It becomes hilarious and terrifying the longer the game goes on.\n\nPros:\n-Fun gameplay\n-Great multiplayer\n-Fun Gamemodes\n-Interesting advancement with crafting techs for new units\n-Collecting materials makes tryharding those slow AI matches worthwhile\n\nCons:\n-Not completelty optimised if your PC isn't fantastic, can get very framey at times (the worst during the survival gamemode)\n-Limited to 3 different teams (races)\n-A slight lack of unit variety on each time\n-Limited amount of maps to play on as opposed to randomly generated maps on other RTS'\n\nOverall, the only cons of the game are things which can be improved over time and in further development/expansions, and I hear a new expansion (free, might I add) is coming in May.

From my experience so far this game not only brings back old memories but it also has a lot of new innovative concepts that I genuinely find quite interesting. Additionally unlike a lot of games still in development the team behind this game is constantly working on the game not to mention about to release a free DLC expansion here in the next few weeks.\n\nLike any game however this game does have its issues but that's to be expected from a game that is still undergoing development. if this game keeps progressing the way it is then it will more than likely grow into an iron giant in the RTS Community.

I decided to write a review for this game because the game is marvellous in all aspects with exceptions of a few annoying stuffs which will be summarized below.\n\nPros:\n\n-Traditional RTS gameplay which consist of base building, economic management and fighting.\n-Variation of units and the very distinctive factions not a clone of each others or just a change in skins.\n-Each races have different advantages/disadvantages in resources gathering i.e. Humans can do husbandry and collect foods from fatten animals, Eleves instead gather food from picking fruits and let their deer generating supply and lastly Orcs can only hunt wild beasts or breeded animals for food. There are also other resources, gold, wood and stone to manage and each factions have pros/cons. Don't worry though the resource gathering/its technologies upgrade is simplified and cleverly done to not interfere with your fun in mobilizing your troops. These resorces aspect also affect your play style for each races for instance, Elves can generate every resources infinitely from tree symbiosis, alchemy and exchange market. In contrast, Orcs have to find a substitute gold and sone mining in neutral areas.\n-Supporting various play styles i.e. turtle, rushing or rogue.\n-Zombies, when you leave  corpses both yours and enemy's unattended, they will become the walking dead. Each factions has different corpse sweepers which more or less affect the battle strategies.\n-NPCs and creeps, it is very fun to hunt down a dragon for treasury(additional resources which currently incollectible) or kill orges or goblins for dominating forward base/small fort.\n-Orcs produce units differently from other factions. If you guys remember the game named Battle Realm a decade back, these orc's units production reminds me of that game. To elaborate, you have to train different types of units by moving them through different types of buildings.\n-Sieging stronghold, you have to break through both outer and inner walls before destroying the enemy HQ. You can command various siege units which are vary for each factions.\n-Quite steep learning curve which for me is a plus as i'm having fun trying diffrent things.\n-Dev is quite active in fixing bugs and adding contents.\n\nCons:( i will list it down from the most annoying/serious problems)\n-Units controls are quite lifeless and a bit clunky, you won't get a feel that you have already ordered your units.\n-No hotkeys at the moment particularly "attack move" command which really destroy the fun.\n-A few bugs here and there which are mostly under Dev's attention.\n-Incomplete contents\n\nImo, this game deserves much better attention than most AAA RTS game released this year. The game itself have everything you can imagine a very good RTS should have and i definitely won;t regret buying it at full price.","December 22, 2015","true","30.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I recommend either getting this game now and waiting for fixes, or buying it later, so the devs still have an incentive to finish their product.\n\nWith all that in mind, here are the reasons you should buy this game:\n\nUnits: The units in this game are large scale and yet have plenty of time for tactical diversity. Varying formations and abilities hark back to the good days of Total War, whilst the Stronghold-like maps are utilised well to create interesting battle scenarios. However, the aforementioned lag makes utilising a large-scale army near impossible and the clicks needed to fight most effectively simply cannot be dished out. Furthermore, the movement is basic at best, with units sometimes not moving to where you want to go at the right times. This can be especially annoying when it means losing half your army to someone pouring pitch over them or them walking into spike traps. What remains though is potential - with optimisation and bug fixes the unit system will be enjoyable. Conditional recommendation. Get it once this is better.\n\nBuildings/Economy: The economy system works well. Things are well priced and utilised well, with clear diversity between the races (more on this later). There is a mechanic called "trickle" where you get small-scale income from various buildings/units, whilst gatherers bring in large-scale resources. This provides a multi-tiered system whereby you can manage the short and long term economic needs of your settlement. Furthermore, the design of the buildings is clearly different for all three and provides more clear strategic diversity, with the settlement sieges being truly compelling and enjoyable at the later stages of the game. What's wrong then? Well, the game pre-sets where your walls are going to go, so you don't construct your own elaborate fortifications and they will be the same each time, with the same set-up, regardless of map. This means that in terms of defense, it can get quite samey. Furthermore, for all races but the elves, the ability to snipe resource points from outside the walls can make defending in the long-term impossible.  More needs to be done to ensure fortresses fall and aren't merely starved out in a 2 hour long staring extravangaza. Again though, there is plenty of potential for this to develop as the game goes on.\n\nOther: The races provide good strategic diversity in terms of their late game potential and ability but the cards and tech development is a bit of a sham. For a lot of the cards and techs, they do exactly the same thing but are just reskinned. I can't see this improving.\n\nTL/DR: Poor multiplayer. Broken campaign. Fun as hell mechanics though and plenty of potential. Put this on your wishlist and keep a lookout for improvements.\n\n","December 22, 2015","true","28.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

If I was going to compare it to anything, I'd say the base building is like Stronghold/Battle for Middle Earth, while the combat is like a mix of Total War/BFME. Graphically it looks pretty nice, and one big plus is that walls and defenses are really easy to build, so no more wrangling with the mouse and drag and drop to try and make a decent looking wall.\n\nThe zombies are a fun addition and really add an extra dimension to the gameplay, since big fights can result in an even bigger horde of the undead coming to attack everyone.","May 17","true","4.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

(hurts my eyes at first, squinting and whatnot. im using a 55" TV and my glasses are scratched) but you get used to it and notice the GFX are decent.\n\n\n\n-edit-\n\n20 hours in... I think I left my game on... anyways. I get this feeling of Warcraft when playing. LIke warcraft 2 and 3 but a mix of age of empires and some TW... pretty cool.. This game currently has little lag for MP, from canada to au theres  ~ 0.1 second lag. not really a big deal. The huge battles make up for it. Orc for example has a pop of 80, and each 1 is 10 units I think..lol and you control 10 as a group.  Theres lots of upgrades and stuff like stances and formations that look really cool when you have 100+ units. They all level up and have personal upgrades too.\n\n\nThis is made by a small dev team so if everyone could support them I think they will continue to improve this game and will make huge improvments each future game.\n\nplus free dlc/expansions. who does that?\nIf you want TW but dont have the money or w/e and you can deal with less then AAA quality games then you should ppprobably get this.\n\n2nd edit-\n\n40 hours in. .. wow already?\nnice.. still enjoying it.\nneed more players for sure.\nits a bit buggy.. random stuff.. UI disapearing.. building not spawning...\nBunch of multiplayer games either end in desync, disconnects or crash.. but hey..\nTW games on sale... I really want to play them but I think..\n\nJUST PUNY HUMAN! ORC SMASH PESKY PEASANT!\n\nWH games on sale... but no sweet RTS building.\n\nMaybe I like it because my strat is unfair.. Rushing my orc archers at the start and using fire arrows to set my enemy on fire. Whist (while?lol) crippling his economy. Then spamming archers Ill soon have 500+ archers surrounding my enemies base setting everything ablaze. Your walls are futile. If you chase me ill run, if you get my archers ill change up my strat super quick, with one building I can change all my archers to polearm and bye bye calvary. If i need calvary my building is already built. since orcs eat their mounts., MMM lol.\nNot sure if it needs balancing or everyone is just new and cant handle the rush/spam.\nI wouldnt wanna be on the recieving end thats for sure.\nBut really... archers autospawn for free.. literally cheap. Once they are going I have so much money to spare, while enemy cant even handle my cannon fodder ill be upgrading and spawning dragons and ♥♥♥♥.\n\nneeds more players tho dangit, if you buy this feel free to add me, Ill go easy and teach you brosephs.\n\n\n*goods*\n\n+orcs,elves, humans  (talk about undead for expansion)\n+basebuilding\n+lots of units able to spawn\n+lots of unit types/upgrades/unlocks\n+can unlock the unlockable unlocks with singleplayer\n+zombies/ survival mode\n+seems to run decent performance wise.\n+map editor\n+custom games\n+++ active devs and mods\n\n*bads*\n\n-bugs crashes etc\n-missing little things... that I remember from old RTS games.. like lobbies, more game options... more user friendly friend system.\n-UI feels sluggish. at times I have to click again... its like the code for checking mouse input is on a fixedupdate or something.. I saw in the debug log about a input delay or something... not sure why they would add a delay so I will assume its not or its to help the game.\n-MP desync and some lag,\n-small user base means more SP.\n\n\n*Edit* 49 hours in... Honestly I have lost interest, I will try again if new content is added like they said. I still recommend it as that is more a review/rating for the game. For actually recommending it, I cant because I dont play it anymore because of player base and I am a very multiplayer oriented player, also some things bug me, like crashes, sluggish UI, and delayed unit response\n\n\ngfx- 6.5\nfun factor- 8\nAI- 6.5\ncampaign - Didnt play! id rather pwn newbs","March 5","true","49.4"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

They listen to the community on what they say and are working very hard in order to make a well balanced game and functional, yet fun RTS. This game has to be one of the most interesting and unique RTS's that I have played, and as a gamer that has played numerous RTS's can say with ease that this game has big potential. What I like about this game so far is that there is a crafting system that is enforced by simplying the game to further tech or enhancements.  The three races are currently, Orcs, Humans, and Elves. The game has a little bit of a learning curve and may hopefully be aidded by some simple tutorials or tip bubbles, however once the learning curve has been passed, the game opens up tremendously and is very fun. I rate this game currently 9/10 for the amount of content that is currently in game, however there are some small things that could be worked out. I would recommend this to anyone that is interested in RTS's or simply wants to have a fun game to play together with friends.","April 9, 2015","true","1.7"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

The other reviews pretty much voer everything I could say about the pros and cons of this game, so this review is more of me asking players and maybe the developers a few things.\n\nA. What is the point of the ruined forts outside of my city? I have taken them over and I'm not sure what the glowing volcano looking thing does inside the fort, I can garrison the fort, but is that the only use for it?\n\nB. Is there any way to attack a city without your men turning into zombies and making it nearly impossible to siege the place? I always end up having to fight the enemy archers plus my own zombies, which seem to be way better at combat than even my best soldiers, wish they were that good alive.\n\nC. (To the developers.) Can you please add a feature that lets you remove zombies? I love the game but always end up having to stay hiding inside my walls because whenever I go on the offensive I end up creating a zombie horde that surrounds my city and then random zombies pop out of the ground, making it even more impossible for me to leave my city.\n\nAll in all, really creative approach to an RTS, lots of upgrades and unit variety, great siege battling. Buggy as crap, not optimized, and really weird unit pathing/combat, but that will be fixed I'm sure.","August 21, 2015","true","10.8"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","1"

My only complaint is that the story mode is not complete yet but what is done was a real blast for anyone that likes fantasy RTS.\n\nGraphics are nice and upgraded from the original Kingdom Quest but could still use some work. From the max zoom out units can easily be lost in the back ground and behind objects while zoomed in figures appear a bit blocky and environmental objects are not scaled accurately to character size. However please remember I said this still looks better than Kingdom Wars 1 if you have seen it. If you have not please go try it, it’s another great game by the same people and amazingly fun for lovers of both RTS and RPG.\n\nGame ran smoothly for the most part with occasional jerkiness when I simple had the screen filled with more than 100 individual troops but I did have one unknown random crash while the game was loading. This only happened once and I have not been able to duplicate.\nAll in all I can’t wait for the final product.\n\nGame played on a 3.3 Intel Xeon Processor, 8GB Ram, Nvidia GTX 960 4GB, Samsung 512GB SSD.\n","August 7, 2015","true","8.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It is something that isnt done in the RTS genre, and it really opens up different avenues of strategy in taking down the enemy base. Another consequence of this game mechanic is that it forces you to make sure that you have enough troops when exploring or else you will be overrun by your -former- soldiers as they die off.\n\nThere are many other reasons why this game is great but they are commonplace in the RTS genre.\n\nNow, for the reasons why this game sometimes annoys me.\n\n- You need to unlock the tech tree for each race individually using items and other things found during your campaigns. This makes it feel grindey just trying to get the tech.\n\n- There are a multitude of bugs such as units getting stuck and units not following orders\n\n- Siege rams are way too op right now. I shouldnt be able to take down three gates with a single ram against a fully defended castle\n\n\nHowever, despite these cons (most of which can be fixed by either game balancing or bug fixing) this game is a definite buy.","August 13, 2015","true","4.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

But here’s what I’ve come up with from what I’ve done so far.\n\nI really enjoyed the theme of this game, letting the player slowly build up their own kingdom as protection from a siege. There are added challenges, such as food and materials, that you need to gather in order to be able to upgrade your buildings. There are very good tutorials to get you started on all the basics, and the game is laid out nicely enough that you don’t get confused with what you’re doing. Once you pass the initial teaching stage of the game, it’s onwards to limitless other parts of the game. If you finish with majority of the game, there’s even a steady stream of updates being released all the time.\n\nPros:\nGreat theme\nHigh quality graphics\nAttention to detail\nConstant updates\nFun multiplayer\nAwesome background music\nHigh level of customization\nLow price\nSteam achievements and trading cards\nLevel editor\n\nCons:\nCould get laggy at times (maybe just my computer)\nThere was in-game rain quite often and grew annoying\nCan get tiring after more than two hours at once\n\nBut overall, it was a fun game to play, and a must have for fans of this kind of game. I will definitely be doing more playing in the future.\n","May 14, 2015","true","1.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

A simple wooden palisade and a few buildings near rich deposits of stone and gold form the seed of what will grow to become a mighty city. Life is hard but the workers are harder, their lives, their future, and their hopes rest in them being able to survive. days go by and the people are exhausted but content for they are constructing their future, they are building not only a settlement but a legacy. As time passes scouts are sent to map the local area...most do not return. The wild is littered with ravenous packs of wolves and fortresses dot the landscape striking at any who venture too close. It has been decided, as the old mines run out and the stirring sense of adventure grows in the hearts of the settlers, it is time to claim their destiny. Armed and armored brave companies of soldiers ride out to meet those fell beasts. The hordes of teeth and claws fall before a volley of arrows and crash upon stalwart shields. The forts are besieged and the defenders rush out to defeat the brave warriors, but they to fall to the mace. As the soldiers break open the gate they swarm over fortress slaying the brigands and cutthroats. At the end of the day, when the banner of the new kingdom flew from the tower the settlers knew they had the grace of the gods.\n\nWord spread to the now mighty kingdom of an ancient elvish city in the far north, recluses who killed any who approached their gates.

I wish I could say good things about it I really do, but it's just bad. This is an impulse buy at its finest. The single player maps are just you with the NPC already having a base made and ready for attack (mind you it's not a campain map) My first playthrough went a little like this...\n\nStart out inside wooden walls, build a few villagers and tell them to gather the resources, basic stuff... But then it gets better; I build an archery range and buy some bowmen. There are a group of neutral ogres just chilling outside my base, so I use my bowmen (just made, lvl 1 no upgrades) to kill all 8 of them, just kited them around and thought "well that was easy" but then I scroll to the left a bit more and there are a **** ton of wolves atleast 300 of the damn things. Thought "Maybe this will be harder". (When have you ever know wolves to stay in a pack that big?) regardless... my bowmen wipe them out easy no problem (Still the same bowmen, lvl 1 no upgrades) so after my 20 bowmen wipe out 300 wolves, I decide to actually build my base. First attempt I build a mill, villagers get stuck inside and I have to delete them... After that I build a house, villagers get stuck again, delete them also....  Then I quit the game, just couldn't take it anymore, and proceeded to play Age of Empires.\n\nPros:\nThe devs seem nice I guess ++\nExit button is easy to find... +++\n\nCons:\nUI: Non existent UI (Only when the building is selected and its just an eye sore) --\nUnits: all the same and walk like a bunch of dumb stiff ♥♥♥♥♥ ---\nTutorial: I said "What?" and "Why am I doing this?" too much...

(If you have free reign over the world you would NOT be stopped at a single city) --\nGraphics: I'm not a stickler for graphics, but seriously?

The developers have continued to do a fantastic job of making changes big and  small  through communication with the players in the forums, as well as there own creative expertise, and its going to be a really really fun game when its all said and done. The graphics as of now are not the best, BUT its running on DX9 and it will be running on DX11 in the future, and it will look really good! Any complaints about no AI for the AI :p sound they like they are gonna dealt with in this next lineup of pathces and updates. All in all the zombies are a really fun addition to the battlefield, and seeing them wander around and do there thing is pretty cool, and alot of people bash them, but they add a whole different strategy to the game! you can lead a horde to the enemies gates and watch it attack the front gates and mob in through the mangles doors! Or my personal favorite: building a huge army and just charging over the walls and getting wiped out, but doing enough damage to let the corpses rot, and then wake up and start burning there town down from the inside! Honestly my only qualm so far is the peasents! They are SO stupid lol, and when you're playing against AI players that sit in there fortress its one thing, But I can imagine it would be very frustrating being in the middle of multiplyer game and all of the sudden have to divert all of your attention to stopping your peasents from being slaughtered in droves by a dragon, or the zombie hordes, or a HUGE pack of wolves for some reason, because they got bored doing what you wanted them to do. I really recommend this game to anyone that likes fantasy RTS games or wants to try something very unique and they like zombies, and/or knights hacking zombies to bits! There are alot of unique features and its definitely worth picking up.","August 10, 2015","true","17.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But as a player who has joined many of these said same games, I cannot stress how different this one is. The developers are EXTREMELY ACTIVE! Don't believe me? Look on the forums and click a random topic and you will see how.\nNow I remember when this game was first launced and how buggy it was, haha those who are vets know what I am talking about and all the glitches we all used to take advantage of. But the thing is, all the people in the player base post on the forums explaining in detail about these same bugs. Depending on how bad it affects gameplay depends on how much priority the developers give to fix it. When I say priority I mean those with a huge effect, developers try to fix it with the next patch, Those with low priority get fixed within a few weeks. Now those of us who were here since beginning had fun PVP and with campaign, but the game changers that EVERYONE mostly LOVES was the zombie feature. Haha I cannot tell you all how much fun I personally had in matches online with the zombies.\nThe times in a FFA where 4 players are going head to head trying their all to take one another out, but alas due to all the deaths and carnage in the midst of the ruined battlefields undead would arise. Now in the beginning this was a major issue, personally I ♥♥♥♥ING LOVED IT!!!!!!!! Nothing more thrilling than that first player finally getting his base destroyed by your forces and wondering how the other 2 players are doing in their battle. Just as you are finishing up mopping uphis building in his base and of course handling the undead that appeared during your battle. As you are taking it all in you see either your base or the rear of your units taking damage. seeing it is a few steady stream of undead coming from the other 2 players side of the map. You cannot help but notice that the stream is getting larger and larger slowly forming into a horde, thus you must reorganize your troops before they die and add to the already large undead horde. Only once that you FINALLY (Ya those of you that had been in that situation know what I mean when you finally get them under control like an infestation) get the undead under control you decide to send a scout to see how the others are doing because these undead came from their end. Only to discover a massive horde beseiging both of their bases and them fighting for their lives against the AI. Ahhhhh haha I will never forget those beautiful games where all players put aside their differences of humans, orks, or elves and team up to exterminate the undead on the map before they completely take us all out.\nThose were proud memories I have of this game, memories that years from now as I get older I can talki video games to others my age or younger and tell them of a game that I really and honestly had alot of fun playing. Kind of like I do with Age of empires from when I was kid.\nZombies now are a joke from what they used to be, they do not give that rush of a feeling but i guess in some instances it is possible to get that horde feeling even if it is just for a few minutes.\n-Wanderer","August 10, 2015","true","33.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is quite similar to Battle For Middle-Earth II, except this game has more realistic battle mechanics, especially archers - in this game, they are not OP, and you have no chance of succeeding in any battle with archers only. They do make a very useful support though - so, just like they did in actual historical warfare.\n\nOne of the things that make this game stand out so much, is how amazingly detailed, scrupulous, and complex its siege mechanics are - there are ladders, belfrys, trebuchets, battering rams, mantlets, and many more contraptions and techniques in which you can break down your enemy´s walls, breach them, or bypass them. On the other hand, you can pour hot oil down from your battlements, or throw rocks, you can install catapults on them to help you defend, build high towers where you can place your archers for a tactical advantage, and more!\n\nI´m not going to lie - my first impression was a mix of confusion, disorientation, and frustration. This game is complex, hard to understand at first, and certainly can pose an intellectual and strategic challenge. And I love that. Once you understand how economy works in this game, and get used to controlling your troops, this game will show itself in its entire greatness.\n\nThere are zombies, dragons, mages, mighty heroes, as well as countless other, less fantasy-esque units and foes. You can build a vast army, that will storm your enemy´s city and lay waste to it, or you can level up a few heroes, supported by a mage, who wreaks havoc with his powerful spells, and try taking the entire city on with just a few mighty individuals, much like in Battle For Middle-Earth.\n\nThis game is absolutely worth its cost, not just the money, the time spent playing, the initial confusion, the effort you put in learning to play this game, all of it.","April 4","true","178.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

However the game's still beautiful even on the very low settings. So all that it would take is some improved optimisation to make the game more playable. I can play 99% of games on maxed out setting, but this game only runs on 25fps, so that will make KW2 to lose a few points. Apart from poor optimisation, the game is a masterpiece, no questions needed. Although you don't always get to just stare at this work ofart for too long as there is always action to be seen.\n\nGameplay\nThis game is like the Total War series (the good games of the series), Clash of Clans (for a giant amount of things you can build) and Company of Hereos had a marvelous baby. You can build tons of different thigns (each race has different buildings), there's a campaign mode, a gigantic variety of classes (every race has different classes), different ways to gather up resources (races have different ways to get them), different advantages and disadvantages throughout the races, multiplayer, singleplayer, and so, so much more content. So to tum this topic up, if you like a lot of content in a game, this is will fullfil your expectation even more than you could wish for it to.\n\nRaces\nThere's currently 3 classes. Humans, Orcs and Elves. Humans are the most basic class (and the most boring)... why would you want to choose them? Well, maybe if you're new to the game you will choose them. The second class is Orcs, just as you might think, some really cool guys who are violent, much like the Vikings but in a beast form. Last but not least, there's Elves! These guys might look boring, but if you play as them, you'll know how powerful they are. They can technically have never ending resources with only a bit of work. Also, they have unicorns... fantastic game 10/10 - Wolff. So hopefully in the future we'll either see some workshop content or more races such as... uh... something.\n\nBuilding\nThink of Sid Meiers' game series and Rome: Total War 2s' mechanics inside of one masterpiece. As already mentioned from my description, this game has an excellent style of building. There's tons of buildings, upgrades, walls, and a bunch more items that you, the player, can use to either an advantage or disadvantage. As you can build, the opposition can do the same. And if you can attack, you can destory. Does that give you a hint? Yes, you can invade others settlement and completely destroy it. After that, you can do an even more horrible thing and loot the townsfolk that you have just slaughtered for different loot.\n\nPros vs Cons\nPros:\nIn depth building\nGraphics are jaw-dropping\nVery fun\nUnlike other games\nTech tree's\nSingleplayer\nMultiplayer\nCampaign mode\nRaces\nClasses\nUpgrades\n\nCons:\nVery poor optimization\nBuggy (this should be an excpetion since it's Early Acces, but there's too much bugs)\n\nOverall score\n8/10 - Even with lots of bugs and bad optimization, it's still an excellent game. Worth picking up once on discount, even if you're a non-gamer!\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group\nCheck out the Original Network Groups.

Still needs a lot of work, I had to post via review because the chat box wouldn't allow me to converse back with developers, during gameplay.\nI got the game because it stated, it would have a coop option, but unfortunately, that option isn't there yet. I wish I had more freedom with the maps, unit color freedom, and it seems that regardless of what map you pick, you're still pretty much in the same spot (single-player mode) ....you can branch out to other parts but don't have the ability to restructure as you would in AOE.\nWhen clicking on "idle workers icon" it will highlight them, but doesn't seem to take you to them, so unless you are on top of area, you won't see the highlights....causing me to have to hover over wherever i see my color, in order to hopefully see highlighed workers. I did like how the workers came out in batches.\nAside from the lack of player freedom on the map....I have to give it two thumbs up for design. There is a lot of creativity and I love that there are a lot of building elements not found in other strategy games. For example, the ability to have troops utilize the watch towers.\nConclusion, this game has tremendous potential, and I was very pleased with the creativity that went into it. I will just practice patience and see what comes of it.","July 1, 2015","true","4.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Still needs a lot of work, I had to post via review because the chat box wouldn't allow me to converse back with developers, during gameplay.\nI got the game because it stated, it would have a coop option, but unfortunately, that option isn't there yet. I wish I had more freedom with the maps, unit color freedom, and it seems that regardless of what map you pick, you're still pretty much in the same spot (single-player mode) ....you can branch out to other parts but don't have the ability to restructure as you would in AOE.\nWhen clicking on "idle workers icon" it will highlight them, but doesn't seem to take you to them, so unless you are on top of area, you won't see the highlights....causing me to have to hover over wherever i see my color, in order to hopefully see highlighed workers. I did like how the workers came out in batches.\nAside from the lack of player freedom on the map....I have to give it two thumbs up for design. There is a lot of creativity and I love that there are a lot of building elements not found in other strategy games. For example, the ability to have troops utilize the watch towers.\nConclusion, this game has tremendous potential, and I was very pleased with the creativity that went into it. I will just practice patience and see what comes of it.","July 1, 2015","true","4.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(Not sure if this has been fixed yet or not, just played recently to check on the responsivness of the unit commands is all.)\n\n- Have to re-issue same commands multiple times for the desired effects. Right clicking moves camera and does not issue command responsively. (Can be Gamebreaking to some.)\n\n- Takes up to 5 seconds for commands to even register sometimes.\n\nThis title still needs work and polish so I advise reading other comments and reviews and also watching videos on gameplay and technical issues that are still noticeable to see if they are tolerable enough to warrant a purchase or not.","March 7","true","6.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","9"

You won't make it through the tortuous tutorial campaign unless you are the kind of person who loves being wide awake while the dentist laughs evilly while he drills on your morals, so you enter the game clueless.

Fittingly for a game set in a medieval world, the elaborate fortifications that sprawl across key points of the map are crucial when it comes to holding and expanding your territory, and building up proper defenses first and foremost, both in campaign and multiplayer. Watching a ramshackle palisade grow, bit by bit, into a proper stone castle manned by hundreds of archers and swordsmen never gets old, along with seeing the enemy break on it.\n\nAdditionally, the three races within the game all manage to be unique in both mechanics, playstyle, and design. The Humans are the most "standard" faction, training troops from buildings and taking resources from the map. Their workers are fragile, their units work wonderfully together, and their defenses are incredibly strong.\n\nThe Orcs automatically spawn workers from their buildings, which are then sent through "training" to become stronger units. Their defenses are lacking, but their troops are strong, with their workers able to fight at range and in melee both, serving as their basic infantry.\n\nElves are an interesting case, having one of the strongest economies, but otherwise unremarkable defenses and soldiers. The ability of the elves to spend money to make more money, without having to send their workers outside their defenses, is quite powerful, and allows them to build up massively if given the chance. Their greatest strength is their "monstrous" units-massive ents, for example.\n\nThe Undead, fittingly, completely change the game once they show up. In Skirmish and Campaign both, they seemingly come across as a minor creep faction that can be dealt with easily, until they swarm you in the aftermath of a major battle and you realize every single corpse can and will become another enemy. Relying on the day and night cycle to combat their spread is crucial, before they turn into an existential threat.\n\nLastly, while the graphics are seemingly lackluster, they serve well enough and allow the game to throw together truly massive battles with troops in the tens of thousands, with the only limitation being how big you are willing to make your army.","April 16","true","15.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The greatest problems is that it fails on everything else. Here my Pro/Cons list.\n\n~Pros:\n∎ Zombies will rise from dead bodies, trying to kill everything comes near, they will siege castles and swarm and block some paths, requiring to add new strategies constantly as the battle on the field evolves;\n∎ Three factions with detailed and big unlock trees that makes possible to customize your army with different kind of units;\n∎ Survival mode: zombies will rise and attack you in waves, each wave bigger and stronger.\n\n~Cons:\n∎ Poor and low aestethically interface with a poor "trade" function (you can trade crafting materials with other players) where it's not that clear who is buying what and for how much. Luckily I didn't fall in that but have seen lots of people trying to exchange 'a golden palace for a few copper coins';\n∎ FPS drops even on high end computers (probably no problems on the last two models of nvidia) when you select units, leaving the game frustrating, most of the times unplayable;\n∎ Unit commands don't respond as they should, sometimes they don''t get the command giving you the sensation of them lagging because of the input, most of the times you have to double or even triple click;\n∎ Some units are cheap and letal, they allow you to stack different platoons of them together and bugabuse by clicking one command to decimate an entire army (noticed it with a spell that shuld only stun enemy units, not damage them), some heroes are ridicolously OP;\n∎ Dragon has a problem to attack enemy units, he doesn't react and when he does he ends up breathing a cone of flames where your unites are not, making very easy killing him with just a couple of archers;\n∎ Poor selection of maps, a couple of them are just a copy/paste with and without snow, with a unbalanced resource/camps distribution;\n∎ Most of the bugs are there still from the release date, some gets fixed but it's not enough.\n\nIn the end the game could be good, it has potential to be something different than the usual RTS, the dev team is following and requesting actively the community to signal bugs wich is nice as it shows their will to try to fix them all creating a better game... But that's not enough, at least for a game that values 27.99€ on Steam, in my opinion they should take them eyes off the old game and focus on this because one good game is better than two mediocre games.","May 26","false","68.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

As a player of RTS style games for many years now, I can safely say this is one of the greatest indie RTS games I have played. In fact it is a solid RTS, for the price, and I haven't really seen anything that was comparable.\n\nIt features:\nProgressive Gameplay; I.e. upgrade talent tree that is outside of the actual battles. You gain loot and such, then spend it to gain benefits, such as a knight, or spearman, buildings, etc.\n\nCommon RTS elements and uncommon RTS elements, all that are good. Base building, troops, management of resources. Uncommon includes choosing to grow chickens vs pigs, to send a cart or not, where to build a farm, how to use the resources. Do I use the wood for this or that, what do I use the stone for, the gold for, do I use food for peasants or soldiers?\n\nEach match (this was awhile ago, sorry if review is outdated), plays out with a strong tactical gameplay set AND elements normally limited to turn based games. The maps are fair sized, and there are plenty of objects to go for. Want more gold, get a cart, some peasants, and send them out to mine. You may need to station soldiers nearby to protect them from enemies, including the undead.\n\nSpeaking of the fallen, things that die have a tendency to, well, come back to kill you. If things are left unlooted, which must be done by peasants, they will come back and be an annoyance. At first this seems trivial, but can be abused to cause injury to your foes. Raid the neutral camp near your enemy's base early into the game with a medium sized force. This way if your troops succeed, a large dead force will strike at their peasants and fort, and if not hopefully many die, and the same result may happen to your foe.\n\nNeutral camps, the enemies vary, usually protect resources that you need in order to survive and expand, and are worth looking into.\n\nThe game is somewhat complex, and has bugs, but is definitely worth the investment.","March 27","true","2.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Playing the episodes kind of acts as a tutorial of sorts. I would fully recommend playing through these before diving into the game. I did receive a few invites to play multiplayer games when I logged in which shows there is a decent player base.

The cutscenes are narrated with quality dialog making it feel like you are there commanding the forces and overcoming the challenges. The setting is somewhat different from other RTS games due to Human forces being on the defensive from the invading Orcs. To avoid any large spoilers I won’t go further into detail  but it is a story that will keep you playing.\n\nGameplay:\n\nNow gameplay is where any RTS shines the most. There are several ways to overcome a challenge like instead of scaling walls with ladders why not smash it in with a battering ram! There are plenty of units to complement anyone's play style. The crafting aspects enhance the gameplay further giving you an edge over your enemy.In today’s internet age no game is complete without multiplayer. Kingdom Wars 2: Battles has your multiplayer RTS needs covered with intense PVP or co-operative play. There are also free content updates no season pass to get the latest chapter or added content! So many great things but every game has some bad mixed in with the good. The tutorial could have been longer and more in depth on certain mechanics. Resource management takes some getting used to. Overall it was still one of the best gameplay experiences in months for me\n\nBugs and Glitches:\n\nNo game is perfect bugs and glitches happen they are fixed Kingdom Wars 2: Battles has only a few annoying bugs. One cutscene bugged forcing me to close the game.There are some visual bugs also like textures stretching in weird ways. The bugs and glitches are mostly minor and don’t lessen the gameplay or story quality at all.\n\nPros and Cons:\n\nPros:\nGreat story\nCrafting system\nCard battles\nIntense battles\nMultiplayer\nMultiple unit types\nVoiced dialog\nHelp menu\nMultiple ways to overcome a challenge\nFree expansion pack\n\nCons:\nSmall visual bugs\nTutorial could be better\nResource management can be tough for those new to the game\n\n\nThis review is part of the Steamified Community Review program.

And personally, I dont like it.\n\nThe grafics, the animations, the soundeffects, the music, the units, everything is just copypasted from the predecessor.\nKW1 was played like an browser game, where you builded one big city and could attack the cities and armies of other players or AI on a big world map. So you had a big city building part, and a big fighting part.\nThe developers said in KW2, they will focus on the battles. And now you are building a base, gather ressources and fight at the same time against up to 4 players on a small map, just like on every other RTS game.\nBy abandoning their "city building" part and mixing it to a smaller scaled skirmish together with the battle part, they not only decreased the actual game content, but also their unique feature, that made them standout from the rest of the RTS games.\n\nAnother thing is the grinding system. In KW1 you had a gold currency, which you could buy for real money, or earn on the battlefield. From the gold you could buy new technologies and hero-units. It was actually a pretty fair system, since you got a fair amount of gold for defeating enemy units.\nNow you dont grind for gold, but for up to 10 ! (or so) different resources-cards, which you get randomly for every fight, and which you need for unlocking new skills, technologies and units. Of course you will always need the right combination of them to progress and some of this cards are very rare. Also mind, that you will have to unlock everything for the orcs/elves/humans separatly.\nIn the old grinding system, you knew what you get - gold - and you could buy with it whatever you wanted.\nNow you get something completly random, that you maybe dont need at all and allready have in large quantities. There is a market where you can trade your resources-cards with others, but of course everyone is trying to sell you his stuff as high as possible, so this doesnt really help.\n\nExcept for the new grinding system, the only new feature right now, are the zombies. after some time, the corpses of the fallen soilders will rise as zombies and attack everyone close by. This can be fun, but also quite annoying, depending on the players. You can deactivate the zombies in the options if you want.\n\nConclusion: The exact same game, but - right now - with less content and a much more tedious grinding system than before.","October 14, 2015","false","9.4"," 14 of 29 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","14","29","0","2"

However the game has plenty of followers and for the years to come, i would give the game a rating of 7.8, if you can give me a refund for my 800 crowns and my home city i lost in kingdom wars 1 (which is tbh a better game than kw2b). I will play more and i will support you when it is needed, though you should ask for advice to better gaming developers, for example the microsoft game studio and total war, they must have good tips for you.

But you need to choose carefully your strategies, because gold and stone are limited if you don't build the other things for collect the resources ( each factions have their way to do it).\n+ Battles are great and funny, you can build from soldiers to orcs, monsters and everything else (it depends from your faction).\n+ They are working hard for improving the game.\n\nCons:\n- Lag: there is a lot of lag when you select your units,when you play with more than 1 AI, definitively it's unplayable. This is the most bad thing in the game, it ruins a lot your game's exprience.\n- The map variety is not so good. All the map are similar, and they need a re-balance for the resources nodes.\n- Ai: Despite the last improvements, it still needs a lot of work.\n- Even though you play single player, you need a connection for using your techs that you will aquire after winning some battles. For that you may incur in the lag on single player when you move units etc.\n- You can't mod anything and with editor you can make only scenarios. They enabled the workshop, but there is only one file.\n\nConclusion: At this price i don't suggest to buy it, it's not worth (in my side it costs 27,99 euro). Devs are trying hard for improving the game, but they are a small company, so it needs long time before having a 'full and complete game'.\nI will update my review, but for now it's negative.\n\nHope my English is good, i'm sorry for that.","May 26","false","66.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is not playable right now. Firstly, my Roccat Lua didn't work with the game. Although it's kind of ridiculous that a developer couldn't get a mouse input to work properly, I stuck through and figured out how to fix the problem after about 30 minutes. The stated 'fix' from Reverie did not work. Once I got my own solution done, I was excited to see the 20€ game that I bought in action, only to find out that it is plagued by crippling frame rate issues as soon as I had a few military units on screen. This was after I had reduced my resolution (by the way, you can't do that in game) to 1280x720 and set the graphics to all of the minimum settings.\n\nLong story short, don't buy this game, even if you find the concept interesting. I know the game is still in development, but it has too many issues to have any sort of release right now.","May 20","false","2.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

And the ingame option of leader portraits to apparantly fix the lag is not functioning either.\n\nAll in all its a total dissapointment and i regret purchasing it, atleast until the performance problems got fixed.","June 1","false","1.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

I didn't really see a purpose to the zombies, they just kinda ruined the fun for me as well and made me want to just quit the game every time as soon as they showed up.\n\nLastly, a huge negative for me is the lack of multiplayer, almost impossible to get a game going every time I try.\n\nGame has potential if it gets fixed and expands it's marketing for more players and increased multiplayer community.

(Basicly I'm against paying for an unfinished product because it removes the motivation to finish the game).\nI bought the game because it was supposed to be a mix of Total War and Stronghold. IT IS NOT.\n\nWell, first of it is VERY buggy, and when i say VERY, I mean VERY buggy. It took me almost 3 hours just to make the game launch, and when it finally did it lagged alot during the intro scene and narrating.  It annoyed me so much that i had to quit after only 20 mins of gameplay.\n\nSince this is early access you would have to live with a few bugs, thats true, and the bugs arent the reason why Im not recommending the game. But besides this being an early access game, it simply looks and feels like it was released 10-15 years ago. Animations are ugly and the game feels clumsy. There is no real introduction to the game, so you just have to learn by playing.\n\nGame graphics looks like a mix of The Settlers 3 and Age of Mythology, with the feel of Age of Empires II. Might not sound like a bad mix, but for a game made in 2015 thats just not good enough.\n\n\n\nI asked for a refund, think and research before you buy this game.","December 15, 2015","false","0.4"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","1"

From the looks of things hopefully still on the drawing board and not in Alpha stages. My first play through was the screen coming up 'connection lost to server' and closing down the game to the desktop, half-way through a game. No warning or option to re-connect.\nAfter my third attempt I actually managed to play the first campaign map. After completing it and going on to the next chapter... well that was blacked out and only allowed me to repetitively play the first.\nIf I could think of any Pros I’ll list them…. Hmmm, nope.\nCons\n\n-Graphics. The graphics strongly compete with up and coming games of the late 90’s to early 2000’s like Stronghold. At first I thought my resolution was 600x400, but on checking and zooming in…. mobile games have better graphics…. And that’s no joke. Whilst graphics aren’t everything, having trouble distinguishing an orc from a human on a 27” monitor at full zoom is concerning.\nI never played the original Kingdom Wars but thought it was something akin to Dawn of Fantasy, that’s entirely my fault and a mistake I’ll never make again.\n\nI see no point continuing to bag this game as it’s still in early (hopefully WAY early) development. But for the current price, I wouldn’t recommend to anyone to purchase this refuse even if it was on sale for under a dollar.","July 2, 2015","false","1.7"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","4","13","0","4"

I feel like the developers could have a really fun game here if they added new and better features. Why not have more units and buildings for your kingdom? Why not make the maps bigger?\n\nThe crafting in the game is a good idea but was implemented terribly. You only have 5 spells for you wizard? Not cool. Only having 4 resources makes the game boring. Not to mention that they run out quickly then you have to rely on the market for your resources which by the way is supposed to work on supply and demand (it doesn't). Having a population limit of 80 is really boring as well.\n\nLast and the MOST IMPORTANT...  You need to add mod support. For the love of God... Mod support.\n\nThis game should still be in alpha.

Want a wall in a specific spot, too bad. Want a tower over there, so sad. To be fair, I did see some reviews that listed this as a problem, but they were a month or two old, so I thought this might be something they added. Failing that, I thought that maybe it was designed well enough to compensate for that. The battles just felt kinda samey after a while.\n\nAlso, I hate the card system. I like being able to unlock upgrades, but you literally start with jack squat at the begining. I'd like to have seen it be at least a little well-rounded. Also, if you spend some cards on a race you realize you don't like, then sad day for you too. The cards should be split among the races. In other words, the humans should have their own card deck, the elves should have theirs, and so forth. That way, if you don't like one of them, you can always switch races and still get some upgrades.","February 16","false","1.8"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","1"

And it's true, the construction is a highlight of the game. Watching the walls go up, expanding the walls, and reinforcing the walls with defences is very fun. That was the only fun part of the game I could find.\n\nThe many bugs made the game frustriating. the graphics are painful and the saturation is driven up to hide it. The UI is a mess. Units aquire skill points, which means you have to go to each group of units and distribute their skillpoints one at a time. The AI is bad, and the neutral outposts seem to be pointless.\n\nThe Combat AI really made it unplayable though. Telling melee units to attack a unit, they will attack exactly that unit, and only that unit, even if they need to walk behind 3 lines of enemies to get to him. You can't even form a wall to prevent the enemy from walking past you, not that the AI would anyway. Just stick with archers who at least autoattack. Worse, there are no formations or advanced orders. The best you can do is tell your units to form a line facing one direction or another, making combat tactics paper thin.\n\nI expected fewer poor design choices and bugs from an indy studio.\n\nPros:\n-Cool wall construction and upgrade machanics ++\n-Old school style resource collection +\n-Old school style unit design+\n\nCons:\n-Bad map AI, Worse combat AI -\n-Blinding graphics and saturation --\n-Frustrating glitches -\n-Lack of formations or complex strategy ---\n-Old school unit design -\n\nVerdict:\nDon't believe the fanboyst.

Dated, yes, but marginally improved over KW 1.\n\nI initially gave this game a thumbs-down, citing it was unpolished, buggy, and generally a mess. Matches were unwinnable, in a number of ways. Content was limited, maps were few in number, and the primary game mode was a half-finished survival style of game.\n\nI'm happy to say the game has been significantly improved since then. Yes, it's still a bit ugly (perhaps more specifically dated looking), has a clunky UI, and seems to ignore mouseclicks every so often. What it does do is provide an enjoyable gaming experience, within the very specific realm of a survival style siege defense game. The competitive multiplayer I haven't played much, but judging by comments, continues to go in the sort of balance circles we've become familiar with in recent years. (Rock OP, Paper is fine. -Scissors.)\n\nI don't consider the patches and fixes they've released for free to be a glorious gift, full of exciting new content, but they are still patches and fixes, a sign that the developers are committed to continuously improving and expanding the game.\n\nKingdom Wars: Battles has always been a game for a specific nice sort of player, looking for a particular experience. However, it's gone from being a lousy way to fill that niche to being a satisfying and enjoyable one.","March 7","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
