"http://steamcommunity.com/id/flayra/recommended/336440/","flayra","Flayra","http://steamcommunity.com/id/flayra/","313 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSuper Cane Magic Zero is a zany roguelike featuring the hilarious (and quite famous) Italian comic book artist, Sio. For example, "learn to count with John the Toilet":\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5j_rGENhmA\nNow Studio Evil and Sio are teaming up to bring this wacko comic style to the action rpg/roguelike genre.\n\nI've watched these guys build this game from afar for a long time, from their super-fast Greenlight, through their Kickstarter (Italian only) and now on Steam Early Access.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUbntiHB-sU\nYou move around. You pick up anything. You can throw those things. Or eat those things. Depending what you eat and what you "believe", your abilities change. The art style is hilarious, with parrot-heads moving around on wheels, skeletons with steel underwear, melons, ham, pirate hates and lots of strange elements.\n\nWhile it's still early access, it's also really coming together into a unique, hilarious, almost party-like game. If you like local co-op games like Castle Crashers and/or unique beautiful 2D art games like Binding of Isaac or anything Nintendoish, you might just love Super Cane.\n\nIt's already fun and funny and I can't wait to see where they go with it.

The art is very nice and so is the music and the humor. I can't wait to see what they come up with in the story mode, but throwing stuff around in local multiplayer is already a lot of fun!","August 27, 2015","true","0.7"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","21","26","3","0"

It's kind of like a top down RPG since you can gather armor and other items to equip. The game also kind of plays like an action game where you and your buddies run around the screen throwing items at the enemies trying to kill them.\n\nAt this time the game is kind of early in development, lacking some of the features of the final game including the campaign. The game does already shows promise though. For some reason it is fun just to run around the screen throwing random items at enemies. The game already looks like it will be a fun multiplayer experience. I am interested in seeing what the game ends up doing with the campaign mode since the artwork is already quirky and I think the game could be funny if enough time is put into the game's story.\n\nNote: I received a free review copy of Super Cane Magic ZERO. Other than the review copy I received no other compensation for this review and receiving the free copy had no effect on the contents of this review.\n\nRead My Full Review [www.geekyhobbies.com]\n","September 2, 2015","true","1.2"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","13","15","0","0"

You and your team can go into this dungeon, talk to unique and quirky characters, before trying to figured out puzzles to get to the next room. The amount of loot, monsters, foods, and characters in this game is impressive. Well worth the money.","April 23","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
