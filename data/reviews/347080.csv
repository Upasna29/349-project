You play as Naught, an undead cat-like creature that travels through dark levels filled with traps and monsters. You don't move your character directly - instead of that you fluently turn his whole world around to make him slide in the direction you want. If you wish to survive, you have to be extremely cautious and fast about it.\n\nThere are new enemies, deadly traps and rules introduced every few levels to keep it interesting and challenging - you'll learn how to swim, how to make use of the tree spirit following you, how to use bubbles of air to enhance your maneuvers and so on.There are three boss fights with giant creatures as well. There's no way you'll feel bored.\n\nNaught Reawakening is quite difficult. Of course if you simply rush through all 30+ levels it might appear easy and very short - it takes less than two hours to get to the end. But its beauty lies in collecting diamonds. To overcome all dangers lurking in the dark and collect every well-hidden diamond you will need patience, wits, good reflexes and at least four hours. Beating time trials is even more challenging and requires a lot of practice, but awards the player with lots of achievements.\n\nNaught's visual style is very similar to Limbo - the world is dark and atmospheric, almost entirely covered in shadows. Cratures inhabiting it are kind of creepy too. There are no graphics options available, but that's understandable, since it's a 2D game. Rest assured, though, that it looks good in FullHD resolution and runs well even on older rigs. It sounds nice as well since music makes the game even more psychodelic and strange.\n\nThe only major flaw of Naught Reawakening is its price. PC version costs more than twice as much as Android and iOS editions for no apparent reason, which is simply unfair, since it's exactly the same game. It might not be worth 9,99€, but be sure to give it a try as soon as it's on sale.","September 21, 2015","true","4.4"," 184 of 187 people (98%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","98","184","187","2","2"

Rotate the world to move your character, collect diamonds, avoid obstacles and make it to the end of the level.\n\nFull ReviewThe game I found intriguing as I have always enjoyed these styles of games. Think Puddle in a sense where you tilt the world to move except you can completely rotate the world in this one. It has the darker colour scheme with some of the enemies and objects adding the only colour into the world which works out great.\n\nYou can either rush the levels or try and complete them while collecting all the diamonds on the level, which isn't always as easy as it sounds. Collecting all diamonds unlocks a few bonus levels and time trials to do.\n\nAs I already mentioned you tilt the wold to move, you also can jump and mastering jumping and tilting at the same time is definitely something you want to do to reach some of the harder diamond locations. There is enemies that must be avoided and dangerous environments to be careful of. There is also swimming in some maps as well and some boss battles.\n\nOne thing I really like was the parts where you have to become the orb and make it through the winding passes clearing debris  to allow Naught to continue on through the level.\n\nThe game play was smooth and did not experience any crashes (Windows 10 64 bit for those who wonder). Controls can be rebinded.\n\nAt the time of me writing this my game play has not included unlocking all bonus levels, completing a bunch of time trials nor collecting all diamonds, but I will get to finishing all that.\n\nIf I missed anything I'll be glad to update my review to reflect that.","September 10, 2015","true","4.4"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","19","20","3","0"

Dark. Inspired.\n\nThses are the words that better describes Naught Reawakening, an amazing platform game based on gravity. The controls are very easy, change the gravity by pressing the right or the left key, "A" for jumping. This 3 buttons will be all you need to get in the game and start to enjoy it.\n\nDespite the simple controls the game won't be that easy and will represent a good challenge to any player. The game will be divided in chapters, with 10 levels each, each of them will increase the difficulty of the game by adding more and more obstacles until you get at level 10, where a boss will be waiting for you.\n\nThe game design looks very good, dark and catching but most of all the comic default of the plot scenes is something truely amazing, that let us think that comics could reborn on media if they were represented in this way. The story of this game is also very intriguing and interesting.\n\nThe game let's you play in a smooth way, controlling our protagonist will be a pleasure, even if we will be stopped many and many times by the obstacles, this will push us to do always more and more, as the deaths are never too frustrating and never injust.\n\nRemember that you can get this ingenious game on mobiles as well, in case you get too addicited ;)\n\nVideogame News, Indie Score: 8.5 | SUPER RECOMMENDED\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WB7iPR9aCs","September 12, 2015","true","0.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

Otherwise you have to do it all over again (fortunately the levels are not very long).\nI recommend it to those looking for something "different" and "difficult"\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRGvRkzvA-A\n(Below is the Italian full review)\nGioca con la forza di gravità e accompagna Naught nel suo viaggio attraverso un misterioso mondo sotterraneo, dove l'oscurità è un nemico instancabile che può assumere mille sembianze differenti. Naught, il Risveglio è un mix tra un'avventura e un platform game che metterà a dura prova le tue abilità, affidandoti il controllo completo di Naught e dell'ambiente che lo circonda.\n\nNaught, il Risveglio possiede delle caratteristiche uniche nel suo genere, che rivoluzionano il concetto di platform game. Grazie all'uso dell'animazione procedurale, puoi calibrare i movimenti di naught adattandoli all'ambiente che lo circonda, ad esempio puoi farlo aggrappare a una parete, modificare la sua andatura in base alla gravità e alla superficie del suolo, e farlo interagire con vari oggetti in un modo dinamico e mai visto prima. Naught possiede anche delle abilità particolari come saltare e nuotare per risolvere degli enigmi, schivare i nemici e lottare contro creature oscure e mostruose. Aiuta Naught a sfuggire all'oscurità e a recuperare la memoria completando livelli nascosti.\n\nNaught, il Risveglio ti offre un'esperienza di gioco unica, con oltre 30 livelli che includono tremendi nemici, 3 livelli bonus, una giocabilità unica nel suo genere, una modalità a tempo per ogni livello e un'infinità di segreti da scoprire!\n\nFeature: - Oltre 30 Livelli\n- Molti enigmi da risolvere\n- Stile Dark\n\nParere:  Naught Reawakening, pur non rispecchiando la mia "idea" di  gioco, riesce a divertire, sorpattutto se si cerca un gioco bello tosto, dove basta sbagliare un salto per rifare tutto d'accapo.\nGioco molto leggero, che non richiede chissà qual'hardware, con una soundtrack mediocre, per la tipologia di gioco se soffrite spesso di mal di testa lo sconsiglio, in quanto il tutto si svolge attraverso il movimento dello schermo.\nCosa ancora un po, ma se lo trovate alla metà, ed il gioco vi incuriosice dadegli una chance.\n\nVoto 6/10","September 18, 2015","true","7.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","5","7","2","0"
