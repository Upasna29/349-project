In fact, I've played this game more than once simply to view the beautiful scenery.\n- Puzzles aren't too difficult.\n- More and clearer hidden object areas than the first game.\n- Story is still very cryptic.\n- Still has "Area Cleared" stamped on places where you've completed everything. Such a great feature!\n\nIn my opinion, Empress of the Deep 2 is the best of the trilogy. However, as much as I love this game, I still recommend trying to find it on sale because of its short length. Really though, I think this is one of my favorite hidden object games. It's almost as if the developers took some of the lovely places I've dreamed of and placed them in their game.","October 9, 2014","true","14.8"," 25 of 26 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","25","26","0","0"

After playing the first installment, I wasn't expecting much from this game but I'm glad that I decided to play it anyway. There is a decent amount of progress both in HOG scenes and puzzle design. Also Gogii Games managed to fit in some well processed plot explanations, accompanied by some bonus content.\n\nFollowing the explosion of the Arc of Humanity, Anna manages to escape in the nick of time. We awaken - this is becoming a thing now: passing out and waking up in completely unfamiliar territory - on a small island. The book that lets us communicate with Jacob is badly damaged, and our only clue is a doming piece of land far up in the sky: the Sky Temple is our next target. There, once again Anna's resolve and judgement will be tested by mystical forces. Will she be able to don the royal tiara and take the title of the Empress of the Deep?\n\nLet's see what has changed since the first game, shall we? Art design is just as beautiful and imaginative, this time heavily influenced by Far Eastern concept of aesthetic, alongside preserving the former Atlantean theme. I'm glad to inform you that resolutions are much better and the former grainy texture is no more. Voice acting is nothing spectacular - still a bit tedious and unimaginative - but there is a certain amount of improvement.\n\nThis time, we face better HOGs thanks to resolution changing, but they are still considerably hard for the genre. Puzzles are ordinary, with still pretty art design. Now, Empress of the Deep 2: Song of the Blue Whale being a collector's edition here, contains some bonus content which would present you a brief glimpse on Pandora's perspective, our evil twin sister. When you complete her story through some memory logs, you'll gain access to a pretty fun casual game.\n\nScenario presentation is far better than the first game, and this time we face far better plot deceptions. There is an explanation for constant puzzles, the cause lying behind Pandora's evil, and even a second look on Jacob's personality and loyalty. The ending was somewhat foreseeable, yet made it obvious that Anna's story still didn't end. There are still questions to be answered and I'll salute the developer if all will be properly revealed in the last game.\n\nAs it is, Empress of the Deep 2: Song of the Blue Whale is a beautiful and imaginative HOG, with the only minus being that one should play the former game to establish a decent understanding of the storyline. If you managed to bear the first one, you'll most definitely enjoy this one!\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","October 14, 2015","true","3.4"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","26","29","0","2"

After failing to save the Ark, thanks to your evil twin sister Pandora who had with her a giant explosive, you're waking up on a beach, with a new mission: get in the Temple of the Clouds or the Palace of the Sky and free the Children of the Lights and their guardians. However, another voice is also speaking with you, so, unless Pandora faked her death, you have to listen to Jacob and this new protagonist...\n\nThe plot is expanding: Pandora cursed the floating Palace and it's up to you to restore harmony, as the Empress of the Deep that isn't still crowned (but when would you have found time previously?).\n\nOnce again, the settings are really good: colorful, cheerful, dark,... anything related to the four seasons. Based on the same mechanisms as the first Empress of the Deep, this sequel is worthy. The puzzles aren't too hard though I had to skip one: despite pressing the right button, the game kept telling me it was wrong - a problem of a hitbox too small, making me go back to square one, which is annoying. BUT yeah, I've said "Skip". I found a Skip button :).\n\nThe Collector's Edition is also giving more information on your life before being pushed in the water by Pandora and on her state of mind. The extra game (ZEM) is also challenging - I will not say addicting but it is really a good idea.\n\nThe soundtrack is also quite good, as the voice actings.\n\nAnd guess what? There is a To Be Continued. I don't understand why, as you're restored harmony but by reading the plot of the third game, the TBC is kinda... not really tied to the main plot. I mean, there is no cliffhanger in the ending.\n\nI recommend the game. Really. I enjoyed it a lot.","August 15, 2015","true","2.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

If you're a fan of the genre you may want to pick a better game, however.\n\nAt a sale price I would recommend this game, at full price no. While it is improved somewhat from the last installment and does last longer, it's still very easy to finish in one sitting. The story was a little better but also more confusing, I still have no idea what kingdom Anna is even an empress of or what the heck is up with the spirits you save in this game. Obviously it's a magical world but there are still a lot of gaps.\n\nThe highlight of the game is the ZEM mini game you get to play when you finish the game. It is quite fun. But over all the game is decent, not amazing. And the voice acting still needs work.\n\nNow I want to play the third game and see what Anna does with her magical dolphin fairy powers...","August 29, 2014","true","3.9"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","9","14","0","0"

The 3D environment has much better resolution and textures, so the game actually looks great (the HO scenes less so). They also used hand-drawn art for the close-up scenes, which helps a lot.\n+ Still very easy puzzles and quick-charging hints. The puzzles so far were mostly recycled from the previous game.\n+ The HO scenes' graphic quality improved too, they are mostly easy now. The game kept some of the unexplainable objects in the HO scenes from the previous game. (What is a rocket or a truck doing in a steampunk-ish game?)\n\n- There's a lack of plot (exposition). In the beginning the player is repeatedly told to save the children to restore the harmony. But it's never said who these children are, what kind of harmony I would need to restore and why their saving would restore said harmony.\n- The map was more useful in the previous game, it no longer shows where I am, rendering it somewhat useless.\n- While I still like the general sound design, the sound of finding objects in the HO scenes gets quite repetitive and annoying.","December 14, 2014","true","3.1"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","0"

You play Anna in first person, trying to save the Temple of the Sky from the curse set upon it. Decent, linear story, with quite a bit of backtracking, much like the first game.\n\nVery averagely entertaining, as the first game. Enjoyable art though the 'blurryness' of it makes it harder to see the hidden objects in puzzles. Hidden objects outside of the puzzles in this game are less obvious than in the first game, but still easy to find as they sparkle if you're in the area for too long. Like the first game, you know you've finished an area because of the 'area cleared' stamp.\n\nThis game's puzzles felt easier than the first one, and the addition of things like magical flying dolphins underlines pretty heavily that this game is directed at kids and pre-teens. You get to save animals and collect flowers and butterflies to solve puzzles. The game adds a new feature by having a minigame at the end that you can play for trophies or a high score.\n\nThe main character's voice annoyed me less than in the first game, maybe I just got used to it, and they fixed the terrible font. The art is still really good.\n\nBuy when heavily discounted if you are/know a 12 year old girl for full enjoyment or if you want some easy entertainment when you're procrastinating school work.\n\nAgain recommended in lack of a 'meh' button.","May 5, 2015","true","3.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

A complaint my friend and I had while she watched me play this game is that the voices of almost all the characters were almost annoying enough to want to mute them. Still, its all for the puzzles. However, this is my only complaint.\n\nWould I recommend this game? Absolutely! If you can get your hands on this game, then do so and enjoy the beautiful world you'll be placed in. I await with baited breath for the next one to be released of this as well!","January 21","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Movement is much faster, there is less traveling between distant and completely unrelated points on the map, and things follow a far more logical sequence. I easily played through it in one sitting.","February 14","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game itself was pretty good and the storyline was different if not a bit annoying at times.  Nothing too terrible though.","May 17","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
