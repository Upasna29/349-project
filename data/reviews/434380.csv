This game is actually a Unity Asset called "UnitZ" that you can buy for $50 but usually goes on sale for as low as $15 in the Unity Asset Store.\n\nNow upon launching the game, there is literally not changes done from the Unity Asset. The developer only changed the menu title and THAT is it. This is just a copy paste game with the developer taking full credit from the actual developers, Hardworker Studio. Now I know that yes you get the rights to sell stuff when you purchase assets, but the assets are meant to help you learn to make the game you are hoping to make or use that asset as the building base. Hell this developer was even lazy to not make a custom map, he just kept in the default asset maps like the deathmatch one that makes zero sense for a "Pixel Survival Game".\n\nI highly recommend staying away from this as well as all the mobile app variants as well. I have seen UnitZ pop up on mobile device stores like Google Play and the App Store and it is literally this same exact game.\n\nFor those interested in the UnitZ Unity Asset Store Page, I linked it below.\nhttps://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/26912\n\nYou can play UnitZ("This Game") for free here:\nhttp://www.gamekak.com/unity/uz/2/","January 15","false","0.8"," 664 of 683 people (97%) found this review helpful 44 people found this review funny","97","664","683","44","20"

Another UnitZ asset-flip.\n\nThis entire game was created and is currently available on the Unity Asset Store under the name UnitZ.  It is designed to be a kit where a developer purchases and uses it as a starting point in creating a game.

But this game is special.\n\nThe "developer" is selling an example game from the Unity asset store. While this isn't technically illegal, it's pretty scummy behavior and it needs to stop. Surprisingly, this isn't even the first time it's gotten onto Steam! Just look up "Uncrowded" and you will find the exact same game, albeit somehow glitchier. The asset has also appeared on Greenlight nearly half a dozen times already.\n\nSeeing this on Steam again kind of just hurts to be honest. Like I said in the beginning, I'm going to go refund this now. It's not worth the $0.84 I paid for it.\n\nP.S. They stole the Minecraft character art for their cover image.

This is not a game, this is UnitZ, an asset pack sold to developers as a basis, but like most sleazy devs including ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• Rodin just bought the pack and put it up on greenlight.\nYou know what, this is the 2nd game like this on Steam, uncrowded is already on here and is an atrocious disaster, the only reason why I would recommend this game more than Uncrowded is because in Uncrowded you can waste an entire pistol clip in 1 second and not hit anything and the most curious thing about Uncrowded is that the trailer had the title screen saying FieldZ (trying to get on to steam didn't work for you the first time did it kotach? you sleazy b@stard)\nThese devs don't even know how to change up the level design ffs. All they do is sell it under a different name.\n1/10, if you want to play UnitZ, go on Facebook and look up Zombie World, because that is free and guess what! The dev of that actually made something original in it!","January 17","false","1.0"," 79 of 84 people (94%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","94","79","84","7","4"

(QUICK EARLY IMPRESSION NOTES)\n\nSpent 5 minutes trying to figure out how to click the buttons to create a character, start a game, etc. (keep the mouse to the left of what you want to click in menus). No excuse for this.\n\nFinally played single player mode. Find myself unable to walk for a good 5 minutes. Realize there's a text input box I can't get rid of without typing something and hitting enter. I opted for "bull ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•" and regained control.\n\nFound various items, none of which seemed to help survive other than bullets for my gun and wooden planks I can attack the zombies with. There's a computer monitor that, when you click F on it, brings up a web browser that links to app stores (and no I'm not downloading whatever it is it links to). Go back in game and found three zombies killed me.\n\nAll survival stats seem to do ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• all, so gave up on single player. Opted to try networked/multiplayer. Attempted to connect with three multiplayer games. All three timed out.\n\nI expected no less...","January 15","false","0.2"," 61 of 67 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","61","67","4","0"

There is a unity addon called UnitZ which you can use to make your own game for fifty dollars. But what he did was just change the title screen to say Pixel Survival. We all know he did this so please. Stop yelling at this guy and just play the game and enjoy it.\n\nPixel Craft is another survival game which you can pick a character to then collect items and make weapons to survive the night and day. Even though this is kind of unoringal I still love this game. It is fun to just run around and do whatever you want or feel pretty epic 360 noscoping zombies. This game does allow everything a survival game needs but makes it simple. So for that I think this is worth the two dollars. I do not really think this game should be free just because of it's features. To be fair if I were making this game I would make it cost the same time cause I used to be a game dev with one game finished. And I would want a profit from working on a game and not getting anything. (Yes I know this didn't exaclty take him eight mounths like it took me to finish a game but still this might be a job for him and not a hobby for me.) Overall I think it is pretty good. Saves you 58$ from using unity and buying the addon for 60$\n\nYes I know I haven't played it for fifty hours but this isn't that kind of game.","March 18","true","0.9"," 1 of 30 people (3%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","3","1","30","4","2"

It was worth every penny of the $0.19 that I gave up to play this. So here's a rundown of all the features that make this game a canidate for Game of the year 2015.\n\n1. Combat: Never before have I ever played a game with a combat mechanic as unique as this. Whenever you click to fire a gun, you expect it to fire one bullet, but not in Uncrowded. Nope, Uncrowded has gone the extra mile by making it so whenever you fire a gun, it unloads the entire ammo clip in one earsplitting volley (Note: firing seven bullets at once does not deal the damage of 7 bullets, in fact, 9/11 times all the bullets will miss). Also, never before in any game has a more shoddy Melee mechanic been developed. The range for all weapons is concistent, meaning that, whether you're armed with a flashlight or a fireaxe, you're going to run up to a zombie and take 10 damage if you want to kill the zombie. Also, the damage recieved by player characters and npcs from melee weapons is not consistent, i.e. you're able to one hit a player with a flashlight, but with a fireaxe, it takes 2 -3 hits to kill a player. Meanwhile zombies will take 2 - 3 hits with a flashlight and only 1 with the fireaxe (Update: June 29th 8:43 p.m. After more experiments, the flashlight is offically the most op weapon. It can down ANYTHING in 1 hit at a cost of 10 -20 damage). Turely a combat mechanic as amazing and aweinspiring as this has never been seen before.\n\n2. Game sounds: Most people would consider it a bug when the sound of another person (in multiplayer) picking up items is broadcast to everyone on the server no matter where they are, but it's just another one of those charming features that makes Uncrowded so irrisitable. There is literally no doplar effect in the game, meaning that zombies will make the same amount of noise whether they are 40 yards away from you, or right behind you. This often leads to countless ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• rapings since you never know whether or not a zombie is behind you. (Note: an easy fix to this is to just spin in circles for the entire game).\n\n3. "Special" Zombies: Uncrowded has three very special and unique types of zombies. First, there are the regular zombies which will start gaily jumping towards the player out of sheer excitement of finally finding a potential target to ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. Second, are the magical Big Black Satan zombies that dwell deep in the woods. These zombies almost always spawn next to the "re spawn" points, which means after you "re spawn" you're going to get ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• again. They deal a ludicrous amount of damage and there seems to be no spawn cap, which means three of these over grown ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•s are going to be somewhere on the map, ready to pounce upon the player's virgin booty. Third are the super amazing teleporting zombies. If you want to keep you're player safe by camping out on a roof top, it's certain that one of these will spawn directly behind the player. The player will then be ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• in the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and die.\n\n4. Day and Night cycles: Because if getting ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• in the day wasn't fun enough, getting ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• in the night (slightly darker day) is twice the fun.\n\n5. Cars: Actually, there's only one car which can go about 0.4 miles an hour, when it's not gliching out or getting stuck on the road. However, the car is the most op weapon since it is the only thing that will one hit a zombie, provided there is only one directly infront of the hood. If there is more than one zombie, the car will flip over and you will die. The car also does jackshit when it comes to protecting the player from zombies, since they can easily jump ontop of the car and proceed to hug and ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• the player to death. (Update: June 29th, 8:42 p.m. if the pc enters the car after it rolls over, and exits it, the pc will be catapulted about 50 feet in the air and die on impact with the ground)\n\n6. The name: The game is way more crowded than the title suggest. The town, surrounding woods, and farms are constantly patrolled by the 3rd Zombie Platoon: Silent ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• Division.\n\n7. Construction: Apparently it's possible to erect a dwelling of your very own, but you're mostlikely going to get ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• by the silent zombies before you can gather enough materials.\n\n8. Realistic need bars: Your pc will get hunrgy and thirsty, which can be solved by selecting any food or drink item in the inventory and literally throwing the food in your face.\n\n9. Sprint mechanic: Your character can sprint forever.\n\nClearly, this game is amazing. It has almost every feature a person could want, killing, krafting, and keating. It's obviouly better than any other game that has been or ever will be released. Instead of paying $69.69 for Fallout 4, just buy this. It's got all the same features and is twice as fun, and twice as broken.","January 17","true","0.1"," 13 of 80 people (16%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","16","13","80","26","1"
