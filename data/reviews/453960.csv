It reminds me of This War is mine, sort of, in that you have to manage a group of survivors, keep them fed, stocked up on ammo, send scouts, and move out to expand territory.\n\nI have only have a play around with it, but here is the first 20 minutes of gameplay for those that would find this helpful.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/JPq69zsZrtg","April 25","true","0.6"," 24 of 35 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","24","35","0","0"

I definitely recommend giving it a shot.\n\nAnd... Damn the game gets addictive!!!","June 2","true","9.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","6","6","2","0"

I think it's going to be a lot of fun when it is completely finished. Right now, I can only recommend it to anyone who is okay with playing games while in their "testing" stage - you'll encounter bugs and crashes, but get a good idea of where the concept is going.\n\nThe game is set up kind of like a board game. You travel location to location through the city, when entering a new location, you have the option to send nobody to everybody out to scavenge for supplies, new locations, and new survivors. You can also craft barricades and makeshift explosives for when you engage in a fight.\n\nWhile out scavenging, it is possible for a survivor to get injured (just letting you know it's not a freethrow).\n\nYou'll have to fight people and zombies alike in order to survive and maintain enough amenities to survive. While some of the fights are simulated, upon entering a regular fight, you have to strategically set your survivors position in order to neutralize the oncoming threat. If one of your comrades dies in battle, they and their supplies are gone.\n\nSome of the aforementioned glitches:\n-Rescued a survivor, prompted with "New survivor joined the group", no new survivor joined.\n-While in a normal fight, my stamina was full and my survivors would not attack. Leading to many of their deaths.\n-When traveling to a new location, said location doesn't load and you are met with a solid black screen, ending your progress. Just for fun, I button-mashed my keyboard to see what would happen and was taken back to the main menu. However, my only option was still to start a new game.\n\nSo like I said, definitely potential here, excited to see the final product! Thank you, Kazakov Oleg for supporting the indie horror community!","April 25","true","0.9"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","13","21","0","0"

Hopefully this section will be improved in future version.\n\nWorth trying if you are into zombie survival strategy game and at least worth to follow how the game development progresses.","June 1","true","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This isn't a "strategy" game.  This isn't an "RPG",,,\n\nThis is 100% RNG, (not RPG).  The English grammar is absolutely atrocious.

The point is, this game is not well done, not made with any real strategy or skill as a determining factor of the end outcomes.  ..Or at least that is how the game feels when you play, besides being extremely boring within 15 minutes of playing it.\n\nDon't waste your money people.  Roll a dice instead.  ..If you roll a '6', you win, if you roll any other number, you get eaten by zombies.  Faster, cheaper, and less horrid grammar.\n\n1 out of 10.
