So if you liked Stanley, there's a good bet you'll love Dr. Langeskov. While the style of the game is very different, in that it's a stealthy heist game as opposed to a walking simulator with buttons, the narration and general voice acting of the characters really bring out the best in it.\n\nPros:Very tight controls\nThe stealth mechanics are very intuitive, and the guard's AI aren't braindead like most stealth games\nAs said above, incredible voice acting for all the characters. Dr. Langeskov himself being voiced by Gary Oldman was a hilarious choice.\nThe tiger. I can't say anymore without spoiling a lot of the game.\nCons:The grappling controls can be a bit finicky, especially on corners.\nExcessive exploration shows just how quickly this game was made, with invisible walls bounding you into areas. Not that bad if you stay on track though.\nThe buttons on the elevator midway through seem to be bugged, it took a lot of clicking around to actually start it.\nAll in all, this is a free game with fantastic humor, grappling hooks, a giant emerald that you get to steal, and one of the tensest chase scenes with a tiger that you'll ever play.\n\ntl;dr: Buy this game\n\nEdit: Don't buy it, it's free. Just download it instead.","December 4, 2015","true","0.3"," 550 of 601 people (92%) found this review helpful 316 people found this review funny","92","550","601","316","20"

There are multiple approaches to entering the mansion, in my playthrough I chose the roof. Taking down the snipers with the tranquilizer gun was fun, at least until the chimney I was climbing collapsed. Not sure if that was scripted or a trap?\nIt brought me right to a garden level where there was a cool chase sequence involving a tiger. After that it was back in the mansion and on to the vault.\nThe patrolling guards' narrative was amusing with a couple of in-jokes, although their AI needs a little work. I crouched right by one and they didn't see me. The game has good weather effects though, which actually distracted them so I could get to the elevator leading down.\nSome weird dialogue in the elevator made me think I was missing something, but anyway after that it was straight to the vault and the emerald. The game seemed to glitch a little on picking up the emerald but I guess that's why it's free... all in all a good game experience!\n\nThe good:\n-thrilling stealth gameplay\n-exciting chase sequence\n-funny narrative\n\nThe bad:\n-long load times\n-weird muffled dialogue throughout\n-some audio and visual glitches making me think the game crashed where it didn't.","December 6, 2015","true","2.1"," 327 of 367 people (89%) found this review helpful 261 people found this review funny","89","327","367","261","14"

It's amazing to see an indie developer pull a game off on this sort of scale. Guard AI is realistic, stealth mechanics are on point and the atmosphere is enveloping. I haven't had this much fun with a grappling device since Ocarina of Time.\n\nSure there are a couple of small bugs - elevator sometimes takes a long time to move, or a door will randomly smash your foot.

A fun little stealth game with a cool environment and some great moments (that tiger, man).\n\nThat being said, it could use a lot of improvements. The game in general seems pretty buggy, and I encountered some very strange things;\n\n1. It took a LONG time to load. Seriously, I was just staring at black for a while until lights came up.\n2. Issues with the rain and lightning. It seemed like the triggers weren't properly timed or something, becaue these events seemed horribly desynced. I don't know how to describe it, it was just weird.\n3. The elevator. Would. Not. Start. I stood there for a good 5 minutes looking around, trying to figure out if I had done something wrong before it finally worked. Serious bug, that was.\n4. The sound. THIS is the big one. I constantly heard footsteps and the sounds of things crashing from outside the map, places I couldn't even get to. There was also a time when an alarm randomly triggered, despite the fact that I KNOW I didn't break stealth. It was weird.\n5. And to top it all off? My game reset, right in the middle of everything. I was SO CLOSE to the Emerald, too.\n\nThat being said, there were some great parts of this game. The tranquilizer gun was satisfying to use, the grappling hook controlled better than I thought it would (even if it wasn't perfect) and the laser puzzle was really, really cool (even if it was buggy).\n\nAll in all, I'd recommend it for a free game. I'm hoping to see more of this stuff in the future, this game has potential.\n\n(By the way, did anyone else find the pencils a bit scary?

The game was released in December 2015 for free on Steam.\n\nGameplay in Dr. Langeskov is simple. You are in a first person perspective, and you have limited interaction with the game world. There are a number of items in the game that you can pick up for extra bits of narrative on which are worth a read if you are so inclined. Normally I am very negative about these types of games such as Gone Home, but this game felt different. The narration is done perfectly, by none other than Simon Amstel with clever wit and charm shining through.\n\nThe graphics in the game are very clean and well presented, with some very nicely done animations on the few objects that do move too. The plot is quite strange too, without spoiling it; this is a game that is set inside another game, an aspect this is portrayed very well.  There is no difficulty at all, as long as you follow the narrators instructions you won’t get lost or stuck.  On top of the story, there are a few little Easter eggs that you can find which relate to the game’s achievements, so it’s well worth spending a bit of time to explore your surroundings in game.\n\nThe title is only about twenty minutes long, and I was happy with the length. It’s a short story which has quite a bit of comical value, and some of the best narration I’ve heard in a game for a long while. If you do all of the achievements in one run through, there are no reason to play more than once, since the ending is the same regardless of your actions.\n\nI didn’t have any technical problems, the game runs in the Unity engine so is very well optimized, with the options to play in tons of different resolutions and controller support too. There are limited graphical options, but the game should run fairly well on any machine given how well it is optimized.\n\nTo sum up, Dr. Langeskov, The Tiger and The Terribly Cursed Emerald: A Whirlwind Heist is well worth twenty minutes of your time to play through, it’s free so you may as well try it out. I am looking forward to seeing what Crows Crows Crows come up with next!\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Lasers. I was stuck there for hours trying to get past the rediculous challenge. It's not even a joke difficulty; the game has a "Lasers" difficutly.\n\nThe tiger chased me past where I could clearly tell the chase was over. The funny thing is: Strange NPCs popped up and started dealing with it. Honestly, I could have sworn I had heard them scrambling around before the chase started. I don't get it!\n\nStrange noises (A man with a bad Italian accent talking about a pencil game? What?) were playing when I used the lift, not to mention it took forever to respond. I was considering reloading that game just as the lift started up.\n\nYou think that's just your standard line of bugs? IT GETS WORSE. All hell broke loose when I was trying to open the vault.\n\nThe game was spawning guards (already aggro'd, I may add), I no longer clipped with the floor, things (including me!) spontaneously combusted. The volume got to the point it was garbled and clipping. The emerald was freaking out too. It was vanishing and reappearing, becoming haunted, and spawning even more guards on top of the original ones I dealt with.\n\nAfter that the game became relatively stable, but it wasn't fun either.\nThe car chase scene was absurdly hard and boring, and tranquilizer guns make the game way too easy.\n\nI couldn't take the emerald because it was so bugged, so  I was stuck with the "poor thief" ending. At least I got to eat the orange and spend the five francs I stole.\n\nIt's a short, free (Thank God) game, but it leaves me wondering. Just who is behind the scenes on this travesty?\n\nEDIT: I tried to play this again, but it says it's already in use by [Steam user]? What? I own this game!\n\n\n(In all seriousness, this is a great game! I found myself enjoying every moment of it. The humor was fresh and spun an interesting take on what goes on behind the front end of video games. I would gladly pay for a more interactive and in-depth version. It's free and short, so there's no reason you shouldn't play it.)","December 18, 2015","true","2.1"," 79 of 94 people (84%) found this review helpful 73 people found this review funny","84","79","94","73","2"

Should I?\nDr. Langeskov, The Tiger, and The Terribly Cursed Emerald: A Whirlwind Heist, which I'll refer as simply Dr. Langeskov, is an adventure game also labeled as a walking simulator, along the lines of games like The Stanley Parable. It's a really short game if you're just focused on finishing it. It may take 15 minutes to 45 depending on how much you look around.\n\n"You can't, you can't, you can't... You can't play it."\n\nThe game resembles the "thinking out of the box" way that Stanley Parable already introduced in a non-linear and spectacular journey. Well in Dr. Langeskov's... it's a much more linear game, but still manages to give you some sort of freedom in your actions as you progress through it.\n\n"Are your ankles in the correct... orientation?"\n\nDeveloped in what appears to be the nowadays widely famous Unity engine, the developers managed to make this game very pleasant to look at. It's not by any means a graphically jaw-dropping game, but it doesn't mean it's not beautiful. Just like Mirror's Edge, simplicity can create beauty.\n\n"Did they hear us? Don't move!"\n\nThe gameplay mechanics, as this is a walking simulator, are pretty much... walking. There's not much to comment here besides walking with WASD, interacting with LMB/Space, zoom with RMB and crouch with C. Again I do say, it's so simple, yet it's so great. What you see and what you do is not really the best in this videogame, I'm talking about the voice acting! It is so good, all thanks to the performance of the narrator!\n\n"Okay, now press 9... Oh, forget about that one."\n\nFor the price it is, without a single doubt I absolutely recommend you, the reader, to immediately go to the game's page and download it, free of charge, and enjoy your 30 minutes of a comedic and totally different kind of game. 9/10","December 7, 2015","true","3.9"," 56 of 61 people (92%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","92","56","61","11","0"

I'm a huge fan of stealth and heists and this game hits so many of the right notes in such a short time. Everything you'd want is right there, all accompanied by gorgeous visuals and impeccable music. Others have pointed out the tight controls and the simple inclusion of a lean button was the highlight for me.\n\nNow, as much as I love the game, there are a few...oddities to it. I dunno, they seem minor but, I dunno, felt off? Let me give an example:\n\nI'm pretty sure there's only one guard in the game.\n\nBut I don't mean that you only encounter one guard. Or that they've just resused the one model over and over with different novelty moustaches on each time, like I through at first. Because, like, at one point I found a secret passage into the mansion, but it was untextured and had this default, brown colour (kinda like plywood, I guess) and I don't think I was meant to go that way? But I got to the ballroom and the one guard in there was...panting. Like they'd actually just sprinted from the garden up 2 flights of stairs? And they hadn't even changed her hat this time.\n\nI dunno, does that sound silly? I guess it sounds silly when I write it down. But there was also some messed up sound triggers, like I heard a lot of running coming from inside the walls.\n\nBut hey, no, these are really minor things and at the end of the day it felt like it was all holding together, you know? Like, they really wanted everything to work just right and you can feel that.\n\nAlso, I don't think I've ever felt like any other game character GENUINELY wanted to eat me before.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacquesLeSauve/recommended/409160/","JacquesLeSauve","JacquesLeSauve","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JacquesLeSauve/","591 products in account","As a developer, when one of your fold was also a part of making a game like the incredibly well received (and entirely deserving) The Stanley Parable, for better or worse anything they touch is going to have a lot of baggage with it as high expectations will surely follow. But as it happens, this game more than lives up to it, and even manages to make its greatness seem effortless in the process.\n\nI didn't know anything about the game before going into it - it just showed up on Steam one day, I saw it was free and short, and so I just instantly dived right in. I'm so glad I did, too, as I really think that's the best way for everyone to approach it as well. What I think I can safely say, though, is it's a first-person game very much in the style of The Stanley Parable, except where that was a game largely about the player (arguably. Unless I got it very, very wrong), this is more about the makers and the perceptions around them (arguably. Unless I got it very, very wrong). I feel like if I say any more about it then I'd risk spoiling it, so I'm just gonna shut my gob about the story now.\n\nSpeaking of being gobby, easily the best attraction at the fair here is the voice-over work provided by British comedian, Simon Amstell, who accompanies you throughout the entire course of your journey. He does such an amazing job that I really can't imagine anyone else playing the role, bringing with him an affable warmth that seems to come naturally and makes for a very welcome companion where most other games would more than likely have unwittingly made such a character an annoyance. By itself, this would have gotten the game pretty far, but what helps it really go the distance is the writing which hits its target beautifully every time. I've touched upon it before in previous reviews, but it never ceases to amaze me how much indie developers hit the nail on the head so perfectly when it comes to writing and acting, while big budget, triple-A studios churn out so many painfully cringey examples that sound like they could be straight from a Saturday morning kid's TV show. In fact, I think this may even set the new gold standard for me, perhaps just about trumping out Wheatley in Portal 2... though I may back down on that if I play them both again.\n\nGiven that the whole thing clocks in at roughly 20 minutes and has little reply value beyond a few minor variations in dialogue (although I was more than happy to play it through multiple times), there's not much else to say about it, and honestly, you really are better off just playing it and finding out for yourself what it's like. If you're reading this and somehow haven't played the game yet, I'd urge you to, then go tell everyone else you know to do the same since there's nothing to lose by giving it a shot and so much good stuff to take away from it. And while you're at it I also think it's worth keeping an eye on Crows Crows Crows to see what other delightful treats the studio might have for us in future.","January 23","true","2.7"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","18","19","2","0"

Filled with quite a few good laughs, this title serves its purpose and fulfills the point of its intentions, much at it's free-to-play worth. Although it's very short (the game itself is only a half hour (0.5 hours) long) it still found itself having a good place in my heart.\n\nIt's filled with quirky jokes, playstyle, and an actual plot. Most games nowadays (especially free-to-play titles) seem very rushed and incomplete, rather this one makes it's point and does a perfect job of executing it. Honestly, if you liked The Stanley Parable, you're going to love this as well.\n\nControls:WASD - Movement\nMouse - Look\nLeft click - Interact\n\n\nGameplay:The gameplay is quite quirky, filled with humorous jokes, which is it's intended purpose. With the playstyle of The Stanley Parable, it's likely this dev team got it's inspiration from there, as well as used the same style of dialog and mechanics. There's not quite many differences from the two to be honest.\n\nThe story is about you, the player, wanting to play the game. Unfortunately, the game is already being played by someone else, so you're going to have to wait. But, the director has other plans to get you to the game by helping him with various tasks by helping the current player through their game.\n\nThat's literally the game.\n\nGraphics:Typical Source engine graphics. Most people should be able to play it on 1080p "Emerald" but others may struggle if you're on an older system. It's got some quite scenic areas filled with brush and nature, they do make good use of lighting as well.\n\nGame Balance:It's all in good humor, everything that happens is supposed to happen. The only downside is when collecting there is a piece that if you miss it, it's unobtainable, so knowing when and where this happens helps a ton. Other than that, nothing is game breaking (pun intended?).\n\nOtherI honestly wish it was longer or had optional sidequests.\n\nFinal Rating:7/10\n\nIn Conclusion:Definitely worth a try if you're into quirky and humorous games, and at it's free-to-play price, there should be no reason to not try it at least once casually. Highly recommended if you want to kick back and play something casual as well.\n\nPlease feel free to follow my curation page for more recommendations.

But there are, of course, a few points in which the game falls short.\n\n01110100 While the sneaking bits make up the bulk of the game, there are a few action sequences that just seem out of place. For instance, there is a part of the game where you are in a jeep and are being chased by some guards. The whole ordeal just seemed immensley out of place in a game where you spend the majority of the gameplay running and hiding. The game also gives you a grappling hook - what is this, Batman? The hook isn't even that useful. I feel like they added it in for a nice screenshot or a trailer scene.\n\n00100111 The guard pathing seems spot on - they stray from their "posts" every once in a while to check an area they haven't checked in a while, so if you're hiding in the same spot for a long period of time, they'll find you. I think what I love about Dr. Langeskov is that at no point in the game are you ever safe from being discovered. Are you hiding under a table? The guards aren't stupid, they can see that. Hiding in a closet? When you come out, you might find a guard waiting. Running from a guard? Get ready to get cut off and cornered by other guards.\n\n01110011 At a certain part of the game you get a blackjack, and it is at this point that you can truly fight back against the guards. However, don't expect yourself to be a superhuman. The thing is clunky and heavy, and the guards are trained, while you are not. They will always outmanuever you, so once again, you are forced to hide and use your blackjack purely for stealthy attacks.\n\n00100000 01101110 At the point where they make you fight the {redacted} the game starts to fall apart a little bit. When the {redacted} {redacted} the {redacted} and {redacted} you can see the {redacted} a little bit through the {redacted}.\n\n01101111 01110100 I feel like the 2nd half of the game was rushed, as if they had a deadline to meet and they needed to meet it very quickly. But it still isn't a bad game, and I wholely recommend you get it. But this is not a perfect game.\n\n00100000 01101111 The voice acting is spot on, the characters look lifelike while not falling (thankfully) into the uncanny valley. The slight artsy comicbook look the developers over at CCC gave the game is absolutely charming.\n\n01110110 01100101 01110010  So altogether, I would rate the game as follows:\n\nGameplay 8/10\nMusic 7/10\nGraphics 8/10\nVoice Acting 9/10\nStory 8/10\n\nA must buy for any stealth game fan.","December 8, 2015","true","1.2"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","83","15","18","12","1"

So when I heard about this, I was immediately into it, even ready to buy it right away, even if they said in the first place that it was going to be 20 minutes of gameplay. As kind of a surprise, it's a free-for-all game. So I don't see why to complain here.\n\nThe set-up is simple: there's a big plan for a big heist to steal the emerald. Just do it. But the "game" doesen't quite goes as planned. I won't give it away.\n\nIf you're familiar with Stanley Parable, you know that the humor is going to be top notch, and the dialog between the narrator and the silent player just a lot of fun to experience.\nPlus they threw in some little secrets to make the game replayable as much as possible: turns out if you pick up the tape recorder at the beginning, you can pick up and listen to all the tapes scattered around the map. And they're so much worth to listen to, since they give some nice sketches, voiced by no other then Justin Roiland (Rick and Morty creator, if you're not too familiar with the name). They're just some nice improv from him, and they're funny as hell.\n\nGameplay is classic on this genre, move around with WASD and click on stuff. Not much to say here.\n\nThe music kinda lacking honestly, only 1 main track basicly, and it's not too memorable, but it helped giving more shape to the climax.\n\nSadly the game is not too big, and in the end the "story" is pretty basic and linear, with no multiple finals or paths like Stanley Parable, but there's no reason to complain about that, I mean, we still got a fun short experience out of this.\n\nFinal score: 9/10\n\nIf this game is just an introduction to what this new studio "Crow Crow Crow" can do, I believe they stepped immediatly into the right direction, and I'll be looking forward for more games from them.","December 4, 2015","true","1.5"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","3"

I only downloaded this game for the achievements. It's just free, you know?

The sunset looked magical, the rain effect is nice, and when the thunder came in, it took quite a while but when it did, that was so nice.\n\nAnd then the tiger chase sequence, oh God, that was really good, had me running so fast. Took a while for it to leave.\n\nThere were some bugs though. When you press the elevator button, it can take a while for it to go down. And I think I heard some dialogue running in the background even though there wasn't anyone there. It's probably just a bug. Also, there was a time when Steam actually blocked you from proceeding further. Had to restart, but that happened only once.\n\nThe voice acting is, should I say, outstanding. I take it most of the NPCs are just there for comical effect, but I really do feel for them and their struggle. I really do.\n\nAll in all, not bad.

Also the pretzels wont appear until you beat the game once.","May 18","true","1.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It's not really a long game at all, but that's fine. It is still fun, and for its style, it probably would've gotten annoying if it was too long and exactly the same way (i.e., linear, whereas The Stanley Parable had different paths).\n\nI went into the game blind. Granted, it is a new game, but it doesn't seem that difficult to find out what it's about. So what I mean is that I literally didn't read forum posts, or reviews, or even the store's description (so I completely missed the sarcasm and how it works with the actual game). But I think I ended up enjoying it even more because of that, because I was actually caught off guard.\n\nThe game is simple, involves no real work, and you can finish it in an extended coffee break, almost. If you don't like the sense of humor, then there's not really much else you can find in the game, though it's not like you'll get to say you wasted hours playing it!\n\nFor me, I apparently spent 2 hours in it, but some of that time was on the title screen or standing around. The rest of it was due to one of the minor issues I had with the game. The achievements were broken. On my first go-around, I got two of them, but the game didn't give me the one of the lights, which I'm certain I completed. It took me multiple playthroughs to get all of them (and in fact, the coins achievement took 3 playthroughs before it popped up, and I was already using a guide by the 2nd playthrough). The achievements are "minor" because the game is short, but for people who want them, it's annoying that they were broken like that.\n\nThe other problem I had with the game was a matter of taste. I loved the main game itself, but hated the cassette tapes just because of how gibberish they were. I didn't expect them to have any actual serious material, but that guy who apparently a bunch of people know was really annoying. To each his own, I guess.\n\nBut the game itself is quick and fun, so go ahead, try it out. It's free, anyway!","December 5, 2015","true","2.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Its more like try yourself to see the beauty in it kinda game, soo there's not much that i can say except that its really funny and will makes you laugh out loud or at the very least, it could makes you smile a bit. If you really like the comedy though and haven't played the Stanley Parable, you should pick that up and laugh at every jokes that game throw at you.\n\nThe story, hmm.. If you see the description its a compelling game about heist... Wait a second.. a strike ?! There is something strange here... To know what is this game and why i recommending it to you even though its strange description, you got to try it yourself. ;)\n\nIts a free game that will make you laugh out loud and at the very least, smile a bit.

I didn't know how much I liked heists until after I finished the game, but Dr. Langeskov, The Tiger, and the Terribly Crused Emerald is a modern day classic. Everything may not work in a seameless fashion, but the game's atmosphere more than makes up for it.\n\nThat breathtaking view of the mansion from the distance is worth the time it takes to trek through the forest. When the lights slowly flicker to life, it sets a fire in your eyes to explore. I can't seem to explain why the lights come on at different times in subsequent playthroughs, but that is okay.\n\nOnce inside, the game mechanics start to come to life. You can steal practically everything like coins, brooms and post-it notes (I suppose you're a low stakes kind of criminal). You work from room to room and can evade guards at your own leisure. The AI isn't too great, but it does feel like playing against some other player.\n\nYou get to evade a tiger that conspicuously goes missing once you leave the room. It's almost like you're being tailed by a clean-up crew, which might explain why the guards go missing. Either way, it's a thrilling escape that leads you outside the mansion and into the eye of the storm.\n\nThis is where some of the technical limitations of LTT come up. The rain starts off super heavy, then lightens up a bit. Lightning strikes at random and totally out of sync with the storm. Sometimes it stays dormat for awhile without even occuring. I think the programming is just messed up.\n\nStill, you quickly get back into the mansion and learn the emerald is on the bottom floor. You take to the elevator, which also seems reliant on some unknown force in the code. Sometimes the elevator zips down fast and others, I was left waiting for what seemed like eons. I have no idea why.\n\nThe game kind of peters out after that. You get the emerald and the level design points to some fire happening, but nothing comes up. You just get to leave and that is the end. The rain gets a bit intense, but nothing else.\n\nEither way, the game is truly remarkable. The short length of it makes repeat playthroughs a joy and the random nature of it's elements adds a whole new layer of believability. I can't say I've played many games like this.\n\n9/10","December 4, 2015","true","1.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","3","3","4","0"

I also love the main antagonist: the psychotic Dr. Langeskov. The tiger boss is great too. But I must point out what I believe to be glitches: Sometimes I hear a muffled voice that sounds english. The weather and the tiger and even the lights are sometimes late. Once, I heard a loud crash a bit after I used the elevator. I hope the glitches get patched soon, but aside from the glitchis, this games is groundbreaking.\n","December 7, 2015","true","1.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","5","7","3","0"

Having just downloaded the game you're told someone else "is already playing it" and are then turned in an unwilling helper by the only guy who isn't on strike to make sure the game mechanics work fine.\nThis breach of the fourth wall paves the way for a short narrative where you go from area to area pushing buttons, activating levers and making sure everything works behind the scenes...well, more or less. It might not sound like much on paper but believe me, it's smart, and hilarious.\n\nPROS:\n\n-nice art style and graphics come together to represent the game's backstage\n\n-good soundtrack\n\n-top notch narrator\n\n-smart, funny narrative\n\n-a good amount of small details to look at, papers to examine, things to try and interact with\n\nCONS:\n\n-short, around 20 mins long, no real replay value\n\n-achievements are still buggy after several patches\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=600816171\n\nTo tell you everything that happens in Dr. Langeskov'd spoil the fun so let's just say the game's concept of having you working behind the scenes while players enjoy the game is actually more fun than the game you were supposed to take part in. The way the narrator speaks to you and the things he brings up at times, especially if you take your time doing what you're supposed to do, are absolutely hilarious and are delivered perfectly: I spent most of my time chuckling and was downright laughing hard towards the end.\n\nMy only concern is the fact that achievements are still bugged after a month...on my first playthrough only one unlocked and the preztels necessary for an unlock were not even showing ingame. A subsequent playthrough using a windowed 1280x760 resolution- as suggested on the forums- made all achievements work (pretzel one took two tries to finally unlock though). Even with this workaround it''s still a lot of unnecessary fiddling and repetition for something that'd work out of the box.\n\nConsidering it's free, and short, there's no reason not to recommend this smart and well-written piece of comedy. I really enjoyed it and feel most people will easy relate.","January 15","true","1.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jesusfetus/recommended/409160/","jesusfetus","Jesus Fetus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jesusfetus/","378 products in account","When The Stanley Parable was first released as a HL2 mod, it became popular for the way it played with the idea of choice. At any given point in the game, you had the opportunity to defy the story, to take a wrong turn or to turn the entirely opposite direction, and any one of those actions would lead to a new setting, a new conclusion. It was a game about taking fate into your own hands, and making decisions for you and you alone.\n\nDr. Langeskov is a straight line. It loops around itself once or twice, retreading old ground, it offers light distractions along the way, but the story is entirely linear. Doors refuse to open until you perform the desired action, or in some cases any action whatsoever, which will still lead to the same result. Press a button that says "do not touch"? It has no impact on the progression of the plot. Make as much noise as possible after being told to stay silent? Nobody gives a care. It is, in many ways, the antithesis of The Stanley Parable.\n\nLike the Parable, which I should mention by now was made by one of the folks who made Dr. Langeskov, there is a narrator. A disembodied character who hovers over your shoulder, offering suggestions on what to do next. The problem with this, however, is that this game is not designed for the narrative use of a narrator. In TSP, the narrator served as an engaged character, as much part of the story as you. When you defied him, he tried to pull you in, he attempted to alter the game itself to put you back on the desired track. He was your partner, and he was your rival. In this game, the "narrator" is a faceless director, speaking to you through... what exactly? There's no microphones anywhere, no cameras or loudspeakers, and there's no narrative reason for him to be a voice with no form.\n\nThere are audio tapes scattered throughout the game, because people love those things, don't they? They were so popular in Bioshock and Fallout and all the popular AAA games, because of their ability to set scenes and flesh out the world behind the areas you were exploring. And certainly a game like this has an interesting story to flesh out, the story of a man who wants to make an engaging experience, and the constant calamity that affects him and his employees at every turn. We get none of that; instead, we get Justin Roiland repeating improv jokes over and over. In the course of a two-minute audio log, he repeated three times that his name was Little Tommy and that he was going to leave pretzels or peanuts or whatever all over the set. It almost makes Rick and Morty a worse show retroactively.\n\nThe very end of the game is the biggest gut punch available, a scriptedly unscripted moment that devalues everything you've accomplished. Because after spending the entire time forced in a short scripted series of events, with no opportunity to ever break sequence or defy orders, you are rewarded with a (completely black) cutscene of another person then breaking every rule that was applied to you just to kill you. The locked doors that held you back are nonexistent to this figure, who possesses every bit of freedom that was deliberately withheld from you. In a way, this hypocritical cheating D-bag is an appropriate representation of the creators of this game.\n\nDr. Langeskov is not worth playing. It's barely worth watching a playthrough on YouTube. It's not even worth the ten cents given to you for selling the trading cards. The Stanley Parable was a game about the player taking choice away from the game; this game is about taking choice away from the player. It's the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Stanley Parody.","January 10","false","1.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","1"

And in a really good way. Whereas the aforementioned game is more of a comedic "walking simulator", Dr. Langeskov, The Tiger, and the Terribly Cursed Emerald: A Whirlwind Heist is much more action-packed. I found the animations for stealth take-downs on the guards and the wild flailing punches at the tiger to be very amusing, while requiring skill as well. A similarity that the games do in fact share, other than the hillarious narrators, is the various endings the game has. I've reached about 7 so far (including the laser dodging and tiger riding one), and I have a feeling that there are plenty more. I highly recommend this game, you have no excuse not to play- it's free! 9.5/10, can't wait for more masterpieces from William Pugh.","December 6, 2015","true","1.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","4","6","4","0"

Try the game before reading this review, it's free!\nFirst of all, this is an excellent game overall. The heist is great, and the bonus thefts are pretty great too. The whole game uses adventurous new concepts, like being able to choose your own path with rippling effects throughout the story. One such circumstance is stealing all of the oranges in the orangery, which curses the gem with the soul of your great, great uncle, who will tell you all about his childhood while chastising you for all of the modern mannerisms you have. (Such as using a phone instead of a map)\n\nWithout many spoilers, my favorite part of the game overall was the part where you had to fight the tiger while on a catwalk above the beluga whale tank with only a broken wrench and a toothpick. It's situations like these that made me really fall in love with this game. Another notable section when you have to grappling hook over to the platform with all the pencils on it and steal the oddly shaped paperclip which ended up being the key to vault 214.\n\nOverall, this is an excellent game, especially for the price (which is free).So I would highly recommended to anyone who does not suffer from arachnophobia, as this condition could cause you develop extreme aversion to this game. So if you do not have narcolepsy, try Dr. Langeskov, The Tiger, and The Terribly Cursed Emerald: A Whirlwind Heist.

Top of the list?  Heavens, no!  Keep in mind, however, that this is a free game!  The controls are pretty tight and the guard AI is better than in most games, but you can tell the studio maybe could have ironed out some other issues a bit more.  For instance, sometimes the lighting is a bit wonky.  Sometimes seemingly for no reason loading screens will take forever, and other times be nothing at all!  The button to get the elevator to work seemed a little off; I'm not sure if there is a sweet spot for it or what, I've played the game a few times now and sometimes it takes a few clicks to get the damn thing to take you up!  Speaking of elevators, the game sometimes has visual artifacts: I swear I could see an unused character just standing around behind the elevator.  Again, free game, a few bugs here and there are nothing compared to the great time you'll have.  The grappling hook feels right, and you can use it to get some pretty cool views when it comes to planning your paths.  Oh, speaking of planning: the Tiger is pretty damn smart.  Well done, Mr. Coder!  It seemed like everytime I thought I had shaken it off my tale it was right behind me again!\n\nAnd an easter egg to those who care to hear it: your clothes seem to give you power points, and by taking off all your clothes you will notice a difference in power.

For instance, the game got significantly less challenging when I got the tranquilizer gun.  There was not enough vehicle action and the vehicles themselves were quite fragile.  However, the motorcycle chase was excellent.  The lightning was on point, though.  I'm not sure where they were going with the grappling.  The guards were utterly moronic in terms of AI.  I think one of them set fire to the mansion.  Not enough pyrotechnics.  Also, the elevator did not seem to work properly at first.  It may have been a glitch, as I heard strange noises and footsteps behind a wall as well.  The tiger was terrifying.\nI think this game would be better if there were parrots or parrot-like characters and I would love to see a game wtih pencil attacks.\n\n10/10 decent","December 4, 2015","true","1.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is, as the title suggests, is a Heist simulator. The player is on a mission to steal an Emerald from a mansion. His connection to the mansion and the emeral are explained through the excellent narrative. This is one of those games that tries to be really funny while also having a deep plot and developed characters.\nThis game, however, is very difficult. The mansion is built in such a way that one will easily get lost in it, and the guards are like bloodhounds. This is no ordinary stealth game. These are trained guards, and they will make you hurt in ways not thought possible before.\nI have no real problems with the game. Ocasionally, an elevator would go up and down a bit slowly, but such small problems are to be expected of an indie game. I love this game; it's one of my favorites. I would say that this game gets a 10/10.\n\nP.S. Watch out for the Tiger. He's a mean one. :D","December 26, 2015","true","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Top of the list?  Heavens, no!  Keep in mind, however, that this is a free game!  The controls are pretty tight and the guard AI is better than in most games, but you can tell the studio maybe could have ironed out some other issues a bit more.  For instance, sometimes the lighting is a bit wonky.  Sometimes seemingly for no reason loading screens will take forever, and other times be nothing at all!  The button to get the elevator to work seemed a little off; I'm not sure if there is a sweet spot for it or what, I've played the game a few times now and sometimes it takes a few clicks to get the damn thing to take you up!  Speaking of elevators, the game sometimes has visual artifacts: I swear I could see an unused character just standing around behind the elevator.  Again, free game, a few bugs here and there are nothing compared to the great time you'll have.  The grappling hook feels right, and you can use it to get some pretty cool views when it comes to planning your paths.  Oh, speaking of planning: the Tiger is pretty damn smart.  Well done, Mr. Coder!  It seemed like everytime I thought I had shaken it off my tale it was right behind me again!\n\nAnd an easter egg to those who care to hear it: your clothes seem to give you power points, and by taking off all your clothes you will notice a difference in power.

However, the motorcycle chase was excellent.  The lightning was on point, though.  I'm not sure where they were going with the grappling.  The guards were utterly moronic in terms of AI.  I think one of them set fire to the mansion.  Not enough pyrotechnics.  Also, the elevator did not seem to work properly at first.  It may have been a glitch, as I heard strange noises and footsteps behind a wall as well.

If you like games like the Stanley Parable or the beginners guide (I know, same creator), then this game is perfect for you. Its light, funny, and has a hilarious take on the triple a behind the scenes game development. I did although have a few problems with it though. Number one being that the game is incredibly short, and as well as too concealed. But if you are one of those people that like searching for clues go ahead. I am not one of those people, when I play a game I like to have the backstory right in front of me. And finally my last problem was that there were a tiny bit of resolution errors. But almost every single error in the game has a reason. For instance it is incredibly short, but also incredibly sweet. And although in the confined areas you have to explore there is a backstory. Infact a very compelling one. So all in all amazing game and I would reccomend it completely.","January 9","true","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The guards can be a bit annoying, but if you choose to pay attention to the announcer, it makes the game easier. One thing I don't like is, usually, the game progression relies a bit on the announcer's lines being finished.\nAlso, I seem to get pretty long loading screens sometimes. Sometimes, like 20 minutes. Also, occasionally you can hear noises coming from outside the game that simply don't fit- like footsteps after pressing an elevator button, before the elevator actually goes down.\n\nThe most annoying thing, I've found. is that there is simply an MASSIVE backlog of players trying to play at the same time. This can make the servers slow down to the point that it actually can start to use your computer as a server for others. This is very annoying, but for a free game, I suppose I can't exactly expect fast servers with nothing to buy them with. I reccomend playing in the early morning hours (Something too late for those rubbish Americans), then the servers tend to be open and you can play the game as normal.\n\nAnother warning: The guards tend to follow you quite quickly, and sometimes, there appears to be a "flash flood" mechanic, if you've got bad enough RNG. Which I always do. Overall, though, the game is worth these issues. I especially  enjoy exploding the entire mansion after I escape.

I listened to two and decided to not listen to any more of them. 8.725/10 would do stuff again.","December 13, 2015","true","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Seriously, this was one of the central focus points for the game, and it delivers. The tranq darts are useful, the vehicles mostly handle well, and the tiger... I shouldn't say too much about the tiger. But man. You will remember the tiger.\n\nThe downside? Let's see. Load times. First time out, they weren't that bad, but when I booted this up again to show some friends, it took five minutes to handle the initial load, and there were worse waits later for some of the effects. The elevator was a standout. One run, it goes the second I hit the button. Next time I played, I had time to make a sandwich before it even started to move. And the variable puzzles might add replay, but sometimes they were nearly impossible. The laser grid was tough but fair. The teleportation trick was innovative. But the extended tiger attack sequence pretty much sank the entire playthrough.\n\nOn top of that, the achievements might be bugged. I still haven't gotten several, despite earning them more than once.\n\nStill, on the whole, this game was one of the best stealth action games I've ever played (up there with Dishonored, easily.)

Keep in mind, it's just one heist with around 20 minutes of gameplay, which is why it's free.\n\nPROS:\nGood Guard AI: The Guard AI was overall very well made, although I SWEAR I heard guard voices coming from outside the map, close to where the lift is.\nGreat Scenery: The view when you first come in to the game, with the mansion glittering in the evening rain is truly breattaking. I would pay money to play this on VR.\nFantastic Voice Acting: Gary Oldman plays Dr. Langeskov. 'Nuff Said.\nIntuitive Mechanics: The grappling hook was really smooth, and the movement was very crisp.\nTHE TIGER: Not going to spoil this one for you. ;)CONS:\nBugs: The game is rather buggy. You can hear voices from outside the map (A surround sould glitch I'm assuming?) And the lift is completely disfunctional. There are some other things, but they are less glaring.\nEither way, this is a great 20 minute heist game, that is well worth the price (or should i say lack of) By the way, the steam description might seem weird, but It'll make sense once you play the game ;)","March 5","true","1.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not being eaten is virtually impossible ._.\nThe Orangery has an orange you can steal for an achievement\nThe actual vault itself is very time-consuming to get through.\nDon't be distracted by the pretty effects (lightning, rain, etc.).\nThe difficulty spike in the mansion (or as much of one as there can be in half an hour of gameplay) is easy to get past if you have the right tools.\nThief-vision really isn't all that helpful.\nFor the "first five francs" achievement, you need to get it in loose change for the achievement to work (stealing the equivalent of five francs doesn't work). Using some of that loose change on a vending machine stops you from getting that achievement.\nIf you stop and listen very carefully in the elevator without hitting the "down" button, you can occasionally hear someone talking/walking around. Don't worry, they aren't a guard and they have no impact on your gameplay.\nThe hardest part about the achievement "In the shadows" is that it considers desk lamps to be lights. You have to make sure you personally deactivate them, even though one starts deactivated and you have to turn it on and off again.\n\nThis is a fun little heist game, I enjoyed it, the storytelling reminded me of The Stanley Parable a little bit.\n\n\n\n","June 4","true","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After finishing the heist a second time I unlocked the achievement that lets you play as the tiger! This was really cool and definitely made getting past the lasers easier. My favourite thing about it is how many different tactics you can use to try and complete the heist, so the time trial element really comes into play. I also noticed in the elevator there seems to be a gap of light under the far wall and some soft noises which makes me think there might be an additional secret room that can be unlocked, I paused there for a while but couldn't see any way through so I haven't investigated this further yet. My only critique is sometimes it takes a while for the next sequence to happen, even after I've interacted with an object. It's almost like theres a delay in the processing of the actions? It's a minor thing though because you get so caught up in the storyline of the heist! I don't want to spoil too much, but you really have a OH MY GOD moment when you see Dr. Langeskov finally.

There is no doubt that audiences will regret their precious lost ticket money.\n\nOne mustn’t, of course, confuse quality with quantity. But putting this brief (but, to some, interminable) miniature into the vast space is that Steam is doing it no service at all. Value for money it ain’t. The Steam Theatre apparently could not afford decent stagehands and rumors circulate that a strike is imminent. Fortunately as the play costs no money, the would-be theatre-goer loses none (an important point).\n\nThe piece is divided into three disctinct but ultimately unrelated acts, beginning with what initially appears to be a museum, but turns out to be a large brick mansion with expansive grounds and many expensive art collections.  British comedian Simon Amstell voices the titular charactar on a crime spree of revenge to heist his family's heirloom emerald from the clutches of his nemesis the collector.  A live tiger features heavily in this scene which adds a sense of urgency to the act.  Storm effects and creative use of lighting bring a dramatic flair that the other two acts inexplicably lack.\n\nThe second act follows with a disjointed experimental music accompanied by randomly generated video output.  The set envelopes in flames fading to yet another rain shower. A heavy handed attempt at avant garde that fails to create the atmosphere disired and expected after the moody beginning.  Also the protagonist is notably lacking from this act. The attempted Victorian drama of the opening clashes with postmodernism tone of the second act resulting in a confusion that smacks of sophomority.\n\nTo top all of that off, the third act concludes with only Darkness.  Gone are the first and second acts' stunning if conflicting imagery replaced with nothing.  Nothing that is except unsettling screams and Tiger noises that leave the viewer most upset.  One wonders if any thought went into this act at all.\n\nAll in all, Dr. Langeskov, The Tiger, and The Terribly Cursed Emerald: A Whirlwind Heist brings disgrace upon the London Theatre.  It seems a most laughable attempt lacking in depth and thought.  Two thumbs down and my hat remains on.  When will an explanation of this inexcusable failure be forthcoming?\n\n\n","January 9","true","1.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

If you have played "The Stanley Parable," then you know where I'm getting at. Basically, it's a game within a game that you're suppose to be in and apparently, you're not.\n\nGraphics:\nThe graphics have a "Source" feel to it with some customization on the most parts. They are nicely done. The effects are similiar to the cartoony side.\n\nVoice Acting:\nThe voice acting for the cassette tapes are so cheesy, but I think this was intentional. The guy who is helping you out though...I have to say he does a good job.\n\nStory:\nOkay here we go! Let's play Dr. Langeskov-...wait what? What's happening? People talking? Ugh okay...so um yeah...onto the review. This review yeah. Anyways, you have to listen to this guy who is guiding you to help the game run perfectly for the other player. It's mostly pulling levers, pressing buttons, oh and taking care of a tiger. Don't ask me how they got the tiger. I don't know either.\n\nMusic:\nThe music is pretty nice. Not much of a soundtrack here, but orchestrations and when things are about to go crazy are pretty good.\n\nGameplay:\nIf you played "The Stanley Parable," then you'll understand this. You can interact with some objects-WAIT NOT THAT ONE! Yeah some objects such as-ooo money. And pretzels! Was getting hungry anyway. Oh there's a cassette tape player and some cassette tapes around. You can crouch using the "C" button. Yeah sorry that we can't let you change that.\n\nOverall:\nIf you enjoyed "The Stanley Parable," then this is another game to enjoy. For a short free game, this gave me a couple of laughs and a few WTFs at certain parts. Although the title is misleading, I can say that I enjoyed the game.

It was exceptionally difficult to get through with the hookshot but I made it in the end!\n\nReally, really well made. Fun dialogue, the AI was a little wonky but it was a great heist. I hope to see more from this team soon. Maybe some DLC?\n\nOh, one thing. There was this wierd bug in the Elevator, i was looking for a way to climb out of it and I heard noise behind the panel. It almost sounded like a npc guard was stuck in the wall? Might want to look into that. Anyway, thanks for the great game!\n\n","December 7, 2015","true","0.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","4","7","2","0"

As the sun sets you arrive with your car at the luxury mansion of Dr. Langeskov, an eccentric collector of valuable items. Your mission: Find a way to steal his precious emerald!\n\nYou can choose between multiple modus operandi. Go in with your tranquilizer gun blazing (which is a lot harder), or try a stealth approach. Deal with the guards in different ways. Drop a chandelier on their head or knock em out with a rod. Dont like the violent approach? Hide from them in vents or alter their patrol paths! Use secret passeges, overcome the vicious tiger threat, deal with lasers and escape in an action packed vehicular combat scene (with a grappling hook!).\n\nPros:\n- great story\n- great atmosphere & effects (like the thunderstorm)\n- very good guard & tiger AI\n- very good voice-over\n- good music\n- thief vision with a stealth system\n- demanding but solvable vault puzzle\n- intense chase sequences\n- multiple gameplay strategys possible\n- multiple levels of difficulty\n- multiple endings\n- high replay value\n- hidden pretzels to collect\n\nCons:\n- long loading screen\n- some audio bugs (dialogue plays out of nowhere)\n- elevator response time varies\n- doors sometimes close to quickly\n- some weapons / items are overpowered\n\nConclusion:\n\nIf you manage to complete your mission successfully, the game ends with a very nice sunrise and a big smile on your face. Therefore i can warmly recommend this free & fun game to everybody!\n\n10/10 "Would steal the emerald again!"","January 12","true","14.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Just don't give up and keep trying!\n\nThe game doesn't contain too much story, but the emergent gameplay more than makes up for it.\nAfter you successfully completed the heist, you will agree that it was quite an experience!\n\nI had a few issues with the game, though.\n- Early in the level there are a few laser traps which kind of feel out of place.\n- When I was trying to ride the elevator for some reason I had to press the button like 20 times and there were strange sound effects. Kind of like someone talking and steps right behind the wall. Didn't seem to have any relation to the "story", though.\n- The loading times were rather long.\n\nBest part of the game was the tiger, though ;)","December 7, 2015","true","0.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

As the sun sets you arrive with your car at the luxury mansion of Dr. Langeskov, an eccentric collector of valuable items. Your mission: Find a way to steal his precious emerald!\n\nYou can choose between multiple modus operandi. Go in with your tranquilizer gun blazing (which is a lot harder), or try a stealth approach. Deal with the guards in different ways. Drop a chandelier on their head or knock em out with a rod. Dont like the violent approach? Hide from them in vents or alter their patrol paths! Use secret passeges, overcome the vicious tiger threat, deal with lasers and escape in an action packed vehicular combat scene (with a grappling hook!).\n\nPros:\n- great story\n- great atmosphere & effects (like the thunderstorm)\n- very good guard & tiger AI\n- very good voice-over\n- good music\n- thief vision with a stealth system\n- demanding but solvable vault puzzle\n- intense chase sequences\n- multiple gameplay strategys possible\n- multiple levels of difficulty\n- multiple endings\n- high replay value\n- hidden pretzels to collect\n\nCons:\n- long loading screen\n- some audio bugs (dialogue plays out of nowhere)\n- elevator response time varies\n- doors sometimes close to quickly\n- some weapons / items are overpowered\n\nConclusion:\n\nIf you manage to complete your mission successfully, the game ends with a very nice sunrise and a big smile on your face.

Dr. Langeskov, The Tiger, and The Terribly Cursed Emerald: A Whirlwind Heist is a short but sweet heist game which really describes everything about its premise in the title now that I think of it. Dr. Langeskov, The Tiger, and The Terribly Cursed Emerald: A Whirlwind Heist is only about 15 minutes long, but if you look around for coins and other loot it might take a little longer, and sometimes things seem a bit buggy, like the elevator taking longer than normal to work. The whole experience feels a bit buggy, really, but I guess that's all you can really expect from a free 15 minute stealth game. Dr. Langeskov, The Tiger, and The Terribly Cursed Emerald: A Whirlwind Heist isn't a perfect game, and you might expect more from the developers of The Stanley Parable, but Dr. Langeskov, The Tiger, and The Terribly Cursed Emerald: A Whirlwind Heist is bite-sized enough that it doesn't overstay its welcome and at the low cost of "free" you may as well download Dr. Langeskov, The Tiger, and The Terribly Cursed Emerald: A Whirlwind Heist and give Dr. Langeskov, The Tiger, and The Terribly Cursed Emerald: A Whirlwind Heist a try.","December 6, 2015","true","1.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","1"

I'm also not a fan of the microtransactions for selling crafting materials... tiger bait is way overpowered and trivializes the cornerstone experience of the game, the encounter with the wild tiger.\n\nThat said, I've got no complaints with the rest of the game. The soaring orchestral score which adds and removes instruments and melodies depending on your stealth level and current actions reminds me a lot of the old Lucasarts adventure games, a system I've been wanting developers to add for ages.

Even the part with the lasers, which could easily frustrate people, was just the right amount of forgiving to make it feel challenging without preventing progress.\n\nThere are a few small bugs, like the weather effects outside the Mansion, with the rain and lightning triggering at weird times and the lift at one point not working unless you hit the button a bunch of times (though it worked fine on my second playthrough), but nothing that'd get in the way of enjoying the game.\n\nHighly recommended, especially at its current price.","December 4, 2015","true","1.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Took me about 20 minutes but it felt way longer, like at least 21! Although I can't blame the developers for the setup, the way the scripting system works it just needs you to put this little bit of work into an optimal experience for every individual player.\n\nThe process is really simple though, I bet your Amish great-grandmother could do it even though she's not here as she's been dead for a decade which makes her unavailable to test it for now and doesn't know what you mean by "using" letters like W, A, S and D or how they can "move" some player on this modern screen thing.\n\nThe main experience is short enough to say that instead of reading reviews, you should just play it and form your own opinion afterwards.\n\nIf you keep reading from here on, POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD!\n\n------------\n\nAfter a barely noticable framerate drop, probably from a background loading sequence, the black screen fades into what I think is one of the greatest interactive intro scenes since the first Half-Life. The possibilities of the Unity engine really come to shine here. Not many games start in a small sequence of areas where you could spend an additional five minutes just soaking in the atmosphere and enjoying every detail. It's made to look great from all angles, not just the one shown in the trailer, no perspective optimization done here, it just works setting the tone, even on lower graphic settings.\n\nThe mansion interior feels like a real building, no real fake doors that won't open with obviously no room behind them, never did I think "And here we have the conveniently placed hallway that no guard ever seems to even look inside even if it connects key architecture and as a thief I'd totally use that to get past them. Oh wait, I am a thief! Whatever, I'm gonna climb the outside simply because it's faster.", except for the elevator shaft the whole house makes sense as a residence for real people which helps the immersion more than you'd expect.\n\nThe guard AI is pretty average for stealth sequences butt if you're caught and need to use weapons it's quite lame, robotic even, you feel they wanted to do a heisting game, not a FPS. It just works out for a quick escape into the next room, having a real respectable gunfight and even attempting to not do a pacifist run and just kill everybody is beyond boring, like paperwork, just don't do it, it's the only gameplay element that feels barely tested, uncoordinated.\n\nThere is more than one way to deal with the tiger but none is too cruel, only one would be questionable if you absolutely want to avoid doing any harm whatsoever. It's not obvious so you either find it by wanting to do such a thing in the first place or by just messing around with the interactable objects.\n\nUsing the elevator feels like where the developers hid all the eastereggs they couldn't fit in anywhere else. If and when the controls react seems completely randomized, on one playthrough I pressed the button and it took minutes until the elevator started, meanwhile I clearly heard some little sounding guy somewhere talk about pretzels (?!) and when I spotted one stuck in the ground, it just disappeared moments later.\n\nOpening the main vault is very tricky. At first it looks like someone played a lifetime of lock opening mechanisms in videogames from different dimensions and used only the most common and average puzzle mechanics but after you complete the majority of the steps, you realize something very, very different must be going on here and you just wasted minutes on the verge of triggering the alarm. (But don't worry, you WILL realize what's going on before it's too late.)\n\nNothing too interesting about the way the loot is distributed, most of it is valued by the skill needed to reach it or the level of detemmienation (scnr) to check every single corner.\n\nThe door to the secret laser room isn't too hidden but I forgot to unlock it when I found out how to so I'm saving that for another run. Which definitely will come.\n\n------------\n\nLooking forward to other games by the people behind this experience, the ideas in this one could work out pretty well in VR.\n\nScreaming planet/10\n","December 20, 2015","true","2.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

I mean yes, it IS concept complete, but it isn't polished well. The team didn't really cover up certain things, and I'll be brutally honest here.\n\nYou play as Dr. Langeskov, a professor and master thief, as he sneaks into a mansion and steal a "Terribly Cursed Emerald" (What "terribly cursed" means, no idea, wasn't explained. It IS gaurded heavily, though...). Your car breaks down and a necessary call for help was put on hold as you tried to steal the emerald. Simple. It feels very linear and train-tracked, but hey, free is free. You have to take down gaurds, kill the lights, etc. etc. until you get to the tiger. I have to say I died so many times to the tiger. Remember how you had to kill the lights? Well, it's dark, and while you CAN'T see, the tiger CAN...\n\nBut you get past that. Or don't. I mean, you're you, whatever. If you don't like some rage in your life... The elevator is plain and has strange music playing, almost as if it were more conversation than music track. Eventually you get the diamond and get out. Pretty simple game, but it's free.\n\nPros:\n+Cool graphics.\n+decent (but not great) stealth system.\n+Great music.\n+**Interesting twists right from the beginning**.\nEDIT: +Laser room. Forgot about this gem.\n\nCons:\n-Felt more like a 2 player mode was intended, but dropped last minute.\n-Tiger is OP. There's an easter egg to find out what happened to the last guy that the tiger found. Poor Trevor.\n-There's a known bug, you'll have to press start 2 times to start the game.\n-I don't think there is actual automation in the game. Whenever you boot up, it seems like the game actually hands control of automated systems to people who are actively trying to antagonize you. It really did feel like multiplayer. I swear.\n-Seems to be a bug where in the elevator scene some extra audio glitches and plays, even though it isn't supposed to.\n\n?\n=The plot twist seemed forced. You'll know it when you get there, but it was still well done.\n\nAlso, for the intrepid wonderers, if you play through the game a second time you'll be given an audio device to listen to those secret tapes (actually developer comentary) scattered around the map. They're hard to find, especially the one in the tiger room, but it's worth it.\n\nTL;DR I reccomend.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rebootthehaldroid/recommended/409160/","rebootthehaldroid","Cthulhu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rebootthehaldroid/","171 products in account","Dr. Langeskov, The Tiger, and The Terribly Cursed Emerald: A Whirlwind Heist is a free game from Crows Crows Crows.\n\nYou probably haven't heard of them.\n\nDon't worry, a lot of people haven't. Perhaps if I told you that this game is created by one of The Stanley Parable's two creators, you would be interested. Ah, yes. The really great game that was the brain child of by Davey Wreden and William Pugh. It seems that the two creators had a bit of a falling out since they have now created their own separate studios and are working on separate, but similar projects. A shame, but I digress. William Pugh is the guy behind Dr. Langeskov, The Tiger, and The Terribly Cursed Emerald: A Whirlwind Heist and Crows Crows Crows.\n\nDr. Langeskov, The Tiger, and The Terribly Cursed Emerald: A Whirlwind Heist takes the same formula present The Stanley Parable and The Beginner's Guide. This is another walking simulator with a narrator telling you what to do. However, this game has a completely different tone than the one set in both of these games. While The Stanley Parable was about philosophy and choices, The Beginner's Guide was about something on a personal level. It differs from person to person and always leaves you feeling uncomfortable in your own skin. Dr. Langeskov, The Tiger, and The Terribly Cursed Emerald: A Whirlwind Heist is about unfortunate circumstances and comedy. There isn't much of an underlying message to the game and it feels a little bit disappointing considering William's previous track record. However, I can forgive this since the game is free and we had Justin Roiland, creator of Rick and Morty, and Simon Amstell, a British stand up comedian at the helm for the voices.\n\nThis game looks really great. It definitely has its own style to it and the colorful graphics support the comedic tone nicely. Unity was used really well for this game and seeing this style used for future releases by Crows Crows Crows is something I look forward to. While taking in the atmosphere, it's really easy to listen to Simon tell you what to do next to progress the same. A lot of people say he is like Stephen Merchant's role as Wheatley, but I feel it is more just tied to how both this game's narrator and Wheatley both fail at their own jobs and have British accents. If you're feeling adventurous and not quite ready to walk to the next room, then you will be hearing from Justin, as he is part of the additional voices. You will know Justin when you hear him.\n\nAs mentioned previously, this game is a walking simulator and has no gameplay. You press buttons and occasionally find little nit-nacks and unlock achivements. There is only one ending, so there isn't much incentive to play through this game multiple times. I cannot take a negative score to this, though, since this is a 15-30 minutes long game and having multiple endings would make this game as expansive as The Stanley Parable. Dr. Langeskov, The Tiger, and The Terribly Cursed Emerald: A Whirlwind Heist seems more like William's introduction back towards the Indie scene and as a way for him to bring attention to Crows Crows Crows.\n\nOverall, I recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of The Stanley Parable and for anyone wondering if The Stanley Parable or The Beginner's Guide is worth buying. Since this game uses the same formula, I feel it is a good way for those on the fence have a better opportunity to make a decision. However, do not expect game play and do not expect multiple endings. Play it and enjoy it.\n\nHopefully, we see more out of Crows Crows Crows.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs of December 30th, 2015, this game still does not allow you to unlock achivements. This seems to be a bug since other players were able to get them before.","December 30, 2015","true","1.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Mnay fun levels with great level design with a fair amount of challenge. Choose from a wide range of super-cool heister gadgets, and take down a really big job as the mastermind criminal, theres also a really cool tiger boss fight! While there are some frustrating things here and there, like the OP levels and the badshit crazy AI the gaurds have, though this is a must-buy for any good stealth fan, and even if you arent this game might hook you it's so good! 10/10!!!!\n\n\n\nHappy? Good!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOkay, okay, i know you arent, and for a 15-35 minute game, none of those things ive mentioned inhabit this game, heh, not even close, what what it does have, is the charmy charm-charm of the Stanley-Parable, it's so clever it almost hurts.\n\nHere's the rundown, you are ABOUT to play the totally fantastical game i mentioned before, but becuase another player is still occupant IN the game, you have to wait, and the incredible voice actor leads you away from the waiting, to help out with the supposed game the "other player" is playing becuase all of the workers have quit or something idk. You go do some stuff, its free so no reason to spoil it, but yes, you do come across the tiger, but not a boss fight. Just sayin. The totall game is brillinant, and have a very "indistructible" metal cover that lures the player in to something cool, at the end, you do eventually get to go to the room to play the game, but the game sadly exits to the title screen. The reason i am writing this part of the review is to tell confused players that there is kind of an inside-joke in the steam community to keep this game as it's advertised. Let's keep the ball rolling, starting with you!\n\n9/10","February 23","true","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game is not that. I was looking at the reviews to see if this was a good game to get. All the reviews were of things about the stealth and the sneaking mechanics and the tiger. I got the game because I ike stealth games. All it is is a walking simulator with no good humor in my opinion. What happened was (spoilers, not that it will ruin anything)  a walking simulator in which you worked behind the scenes helping the previous player by pressing buttons to control special effects that you can barely see. Then when it is your turn, another player joins the game and takes your place but messes up and you die or something. THE END. roll credits. THERE IS NOTHING ABOUT STEALTH OR ANYTHING.  The comments say stuff about heists and stealth and the recent updates talk about grappling hook mechanics and such. They do not appear in the game as far as I know. And the wikis and other articles go as in depth as I just did in the 'spoiler'.The stanley parable was a funny game and I thought this would live up to this, it didn't.\n\n\nDon't trust the comments\n\n\nI have to be missing something, there must be something that I can't find to get into the heist, the wikis are not much help. If another player or the developers could message me about this, that wold be fantastic. If I am correct. The reviews and the people that write them are liars and should be ashamed for wasting 2 hours of my life searching every nook and cranny in the game and online. The developers should be upset or at least feel guilty for putting 'grappling hook physics' and hints to a stealth mission into a game where it doesn't appear. I was hyped when i saw this game for the first time, the high hopes and lies you put into the description made me get it. And i am dissapointed. That is cheap advertising. And you should be ashamed\n\nIf there is a way to get into the heist that I missed and the entire internet didn't catch. Someone please message  me if there is a way. This game would have so much potential if it lived up to what you described it as. If there is a way I am very sorry for this dissapointing review.","April 26","false","0.9"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","20","2","10","3","0"

I know it's not supposed to be a huge game and it was free and made by an indie team but I do not see the hype.\n\nYou're told exactly what to do, you cannot deviate from what you're told to do, all the surrounding details and things you can read or pick up are not that interesting or funny.  Reviewers constantly point out how hilarious and ingenious this game is but I want to voice my opinion that it is simply a quirky sounding british guy describing the things around you and talking off of a script.  Several times you can hear he's laughing at his own jokes which took me out of the already bad immersion.\n\n/rant\n\nI do not recommend this game.","January 15","false","0.5"," 24 of 61 people (39%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","39","24","61","4","2"

I can't stand it though, I've played it once and tried it again a second time where I found something I missed the first time but that made it even worse. I do think that it suffers from a slight case of being overhyped, although I guess maybe I would say that as someone who disliked it.\n\nI am fully prepared to admit that I may just be missing one key thing that would get me to understand why everyone else appears to love this game, that meta-narrative thing maybe, but I don't have it, and so that wasn't my experience. Also, it has no sound options in game, which is bloody stupid btw, so make sure you tweak the audio settings before you start.\n\nI didn't find it particularly amusing, a few brief smiles and nothing else, the rest I hated. The story is meant to have some sort of meta-narrative to it, I think, but I don't particularly care for that and didn't really find that it came across well. Your interactions are clicking, crouching and zooming in slightly. Two of which I only found out about in my second playthrough but I can't see how they'd be useful anyway. Your choices when playing conist of a) doing what the designer wants, b) refusing for a bit and getting some dialogue and then doing what they wanted anyway. even though refusing is also something they wanted you to do, or c) refusing and doing nothing for the rest of your life until you die. If it's meant to be a commentary on how you can't account for everything the player can do then I wish I could see the point they're trying to make, but it really feels like they're just lampshading what you can't do, and I don't find that amusing, or that it furthers the genre in any way. There's various moments where the story questions why you didn't do what they want, while never giving you the option to do what they ask. Or if you can, I didn't find it.\n\nThe title is just obnoxious, it's like the kid in school who trys to be quirky to get attention and gets told to shut up and sit down all the time. I've taken to calling it Ocean's 11 Tiger.\n\nI've not tried The Stanley Parable or similar so I can't comment on the similarity of the two.","December 25, 2015","false","0.6"," 10 of 31 people (32%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","32","10","31","5","3"

Essentially, it's a 15 minute story where you follow where the narrator tells you to go and press buttons/pull levers. I guess the theme of the story is, "You're the guy who makes things happen for a player in a video game."\n\nWhy do many people think the game is charming? Probably because it's something different. The jokes are very undercooked but you can feel that this game is lighthearted.\n\nBy undercooked, I mean you'll hear a British guy trying to do an Italian accent of a game developer pitching an idea about a game about a parrot. It sounds hilarious when I type it, but when you hear it in the game, you'll cringe at how awful the joke is. It's like a 12 year old made the jokes.\n\nNow for the game itself. The graphics are pretty nice! They're cell-shaded. The sound effects aren't bad at all. The game itself and the technicality is quite nice. It's just the story and the 'meat' of the game that sucks.\n\nJust my two cents. Since it's free, I can't tell you to stay away from it; you'll have to decide that for yourself. In my opinion though, it was a waste of life. I could've spent those 20 minutes in my death bed bidding farewell to my offspring.\n\n2/10","December 6, 2015","false","0.4"," 6 of 24 people (25%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","25","6","24","2","0"

There was obviously a lot of detail and work put in to the game, but the game its self was not funny or clever as it thinks it is. This game is taking a awesome idea for a stealth heist game hostage.\nIf i wanted to work machinery and controls for entertainment behind the scenes i would work as one of those projector guys at the movies.\nInstead of making a linear 30 minute free behind the scenes game, make a 15$ full non linear stealth game that incorporates the 4th wall in with some of its puzzles.\nThat would be AMAZING!

It's funny the first 3 minutes, but seriousily, games like this lose their charm after you make about 3 of them in a row, in the same style. The devs & the community of this game BS people into playing it, expecting a real game. I'm not saying you shouldn't play it - I got a few chuckles out of it for sure. But this entire game and its community is just a big joke, literally.\n\n(EDIT)\n\nAll the negative reviews are being downvoted for the sole reasons of "ITS FREE" and "ITS ART". I would agree if the devs were honest about this game, though. It's a clever idea, but it's bland and uninteresting. The Stanley Parable was fun and entertaining. Beginners guide was more "Artsy" but still fun.

But I just don't. They feel fixated on demonstrating how clever they are, but they only manage to mimic (with less panache and skill) the "behind the scenes" humor that Valve put on display in Portal 1.\n\nFortunately, this game is much shorter than TSP, but I still felt annoyed during every moment of it. Maybe I'm not "losing myself in the moment" properly. (But isn't that the job of the storyteller, to get me to suspend my disbelief?) Maybe I'm not "appreciating the metatextual asymmetrical narrative elements" or something. (But I spent years in grad school studying that stuff, and to this day I'm convinced that the lot is 5% intriguing commentary and 95% ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.)\n\nIn any case, I think this game is worth every penny of what I paid for it.

I dont really know why this was such a miss for me. Lack of choice and consequence maybe? I dont know, but for whatever reason i guess i enter this game under the impression that it was going to be the next big Stanley Parable type game and it was anything but. Even just trying to compare it to the Stanley Parable demo leaves this game severly lacking. Not sure why its rating is so high. You litteraly have only two choices at any given time. Stand there and do nothing but randomly trying to click on objects or do what the narrator say to progress with the story. Thats it no third options no sense of free will, just moving from room to room clicking objects trying to force some extra narration before being forced to move on in a manner that has been preselected for you.  Absolutly baffled as to why this game has a 93% user rating as of when i post this review.  Im not going to tell someone not to play it but i certainly wont be going to any of my firends saying "You really ought to download this game when you get home tonight".

Dr. Langeskov, not so much. There is only one story thread. Anything else you do is just filler that doesn't alter the story in any way. Humor is subjective and I just don't get why this is funny.

I liked the game, but its a deadend 1-time adventure. The story will take 10-20 minutes to complete and is not very extensive. The plot revolves around you, in a waiting line to play the actual game, and to compensate you go behind the scenes to see what actually happens during the course of the game (that you never actually play).\n\nWhile it is a good gag, and a brilliant idea, the 15 minute run time makes it feel like a great idea has gone to waste. If there was a more involved story, a twist, or if there was an actual conflict and resolution, then it would be a solid game. The thought of playing as a guy who works behind the scenes to have a game work for another player is amazing, but sadly its wasted in a rushed 15 minute game.\n\nAgain, I did like the game for what was there, but there is not enough to love.
