"http://steamcommunity.com/id/femboyancy/recommended/383080/","femboyancy","♥Princess Vaxi♥","http://steamcommunity.com/id/femboyancy/","510 products in account","First I repeatedly punched defenseless, skimpily clad, moany women in the boob until they drop their hard earned money.\nThen I took aforementioned money and bought skimpily clad girl mercenaries with it, who help me physically abuse these poor women until they drop more money.\n\nAfter discovering that I'm honestly just sitting here, punching girls all over their body as hard and fast as I can until they drop their money so that I can punch them even harder and faster? I felt like I died a little on the inside.\n\nHowever, despite the moral gray area, is the game good for what it is?\n\nPros:\n800+ different, unique, recorded moans and lustily spoken weeaboo phrases\n20+ different, unique, skimpily clad girls in different colors to abuse(They wobble when you punch them, SUPER lifelike!)\n10+ different, unique, slightly less skimpily clad girls to help you abuse the 20+ different, unique, skimpily clad girls.\n5+ different, unique, slightly skimpy outfits with different colors for you to dress up your primary heroine in(If you pay them $1.00!)\n5+ different, unique, slightly skimpy(hue) hair styles with different colors for you to don upon your primary heroine(Same deal...1 buck.)\nBunny girls go "Pyoh~!"\nCat girls go "Nyah~!"\nEven if you exit the game completely, your immorally hired, HIGHLY motivated, EXTREMELY energetic and tireless mercenaries will continue to brutally assault the harmless waifu victims!\n\nCons:\nIt's a waifu abuse simulator, disguised as an innocent hentai clicking simulator.\nNo actual nudity(And there's no downloadable patch to make them nude either :c )\nIn-game store...For a CLICKING SIMULATOR...\nAgain...AN INGAME STORE FOR A CLICKING SIMULATOR PEOPLE\nYou get to spend a lot of time in a desert(Seriously no matter how many waifus you punch into death, you NEVER leave the desert.)\n\n\nVerdict: It's a clicking simulator. What do you want, a ♥♥♥♥ing serious review? I mean seriously, who the ♥♥♥♥ reads a review about a PERVERTED ASIAN CLICKER GAME!?....In fact who 'writes' a review about a perverted Asian clicker game....? I'm gonna stop now...I'll let everyones favorite corrupt video game reviewer take it from here....\n\n*Noises of microphone being passed on*\n\n\n"The best waifu abuse simulator!"\n10/10 - IGN\n\nThanks IGN. No one loves you anymore cause you sold out.\n\n\nEDIT: Okay, so they made your mercenaries punch harder, and they made you just enslave your waifu after abusing them into submission, rather than just outright killing them, AND they made you actually switch locations now when you go to a new area number.\n......\nAND YET THERE'S STILL NO NUDITY MOD TO BUY!? COME ON!!! I WANT TO SEE MY 16000 WAIFUS NUDE!\nSpeaking of which...Why isn't there a gallery somewhere where you can see a picture of each unique waifu you've abused so far? I mean I punch my girls repeatedly till they whimper, and then I never see them again!

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198067866778/recommended/383080/","76561198067866778","Did Someone Say Onion?","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198067866778/","20 products in account","Day 0: Friend tells me off great game recently released on steam, he tells me, its right up my alley. Naturally, I looked. I opened the page, it mentioned "800+ moans when you defeat monsters", at that point there was no pair of pants able to contain the raging boner I had. It throbbed at the thought of clicking on my favourite waifu's anywhere on their voluptuous bodies, I knew, at that moment, I must have it.\n\nDay 1: I had just finished downloading the game, using up the last bit of my internet quota. But it was worth it. I load up the game, I see before me a big bosomed bear ready to receive my furious clicking. I place my cursor over her breasts and repeatedly click. CLICK. CLICK. CLICK. My finger is going numb, my other hand is tired from its repetitive... actions. Yet, I can not bring myself to stop. My fingers hunger for the waifu's, I have acquired a masterful 0.3 waifu's/second and am currently looking to conquer the zones like captain cook did to those abo ♥♥♥♥♥. I realise, that this is more than just a game, more than just a method to release all my built up desires, it is the thing I have been waiting for all my life.\n\nDay 3: I still have yet to sleep, my vision is beginning to blur and my mind feels as if its tearing apart. The consistent moaning the only thing helping me cling to my sanity. My parents have given up on me. They walk into my room and plead me to stop, tears rolling down their face and grief in their hearts. I drown out their worthless cries in order to maintain a consistent waifu's/minute ratio so as to expand my waifu companions in order to abuse more monsters for more waifu gold. I have now come to my senses. It is clear what is to happen. I, in order to give this game the attention it deserves, will start my own Sakura Clicker professional scene.\n\nDay 5: Sleep still evades me, I haven't blinked in the past 6 hours so that I won't miss a spirit or treasure chest that may appear. I must avoid it, the gold is invaluable. My Sakura Clicker professional scene has yet to boom in popularity, yet I will not falter. I will remain stalwart until this game becomes the new CSGO, LoL, DotA, etc.. I am now working as a full time Sakura Clicker Gamer. It may have no income, it may cause girls of all shapes, sizes and forms to recoil in disgust at the very mention of my name, but yet I do not regret it. I must increase my waifu's/minute, it has been lacking of late. My body is exhausted, my eyes are heavy, my balls are stained, I smell like a fat mexican smeared taco sauce over himself and sat in the African sun to grill for several days. I have drunk my 13th energy drink for the day, I am running low, I have just finished my reserves and my parents are too depressed to buy more. I need to go myself, I need sustenance, but I can't for now. I will have to wait.\n\nDay 6: I finished my morning gold farming and rushed down to the corner store, I smelt and looked like the underside of an obese man's gooch. I cleared out the entire rack of energy drinks and quickly rushed back to my home. The sun burned my skin, my lungs were filled with grease and I had lost almost all functioning in my legs. I now live on a diet of energy drinks and doritoes, but as long as I am able to maintain my current waifu's per second, there is not a thing in the world to deter me from continuing.\n\nDay 10: I fell asleep at my desk last night, I was unable to stop myself. The days of fatigue had finally caught up and I passed out with my pants around my ankles with my computer moaning every few seconds. I wake up and see that my parents have left and taken everything. I now sit in the basement, alone, contemplating to what extent I have cursed myself. I stand up, half naked and look over to a nearby mirror. I look like Zach Galifianakis had furious sex with a bear with superglue attached to his body and then ♥♥♥♥ into his hands and smeared all over himself. I open my forgotten facebook account and see several dozen notifications. R.I.P messages riddle my home page and I am believed dead by  the entire town except for the local clerks at the 7/11. I came to the realisation that I had just wasted more than a week of my life on a clicking game with anime girls moaning every few seconds and a 1 song soundtrack which repeated every 45 seconds. I then looked over at my computer, it was still running Sakura Clicker. I sit down and continue my deeds until I die from exhaustion.\n\nOverall: 10/10 game, lost everything and everyone of any importance in my life to this game yet I don't regret anything.\n\nEdit:\n\nDay 12: My power went out yesterday. I crawled into a ball, pants around my ankle, lying in a pool off my own grease and various other... secretions. I didn't know what else to do for I had lost the one thing for which I cared for in my entire life. I had decided that for lack of other things to do, to go to school. I do not know how I had survived so long, instinctively clicking for days on end and as expected, so did all of my former friends. They looked upon me, as if I was Jesus being resurrected after atoning for their sins. I explained to them the situation, that their existences were meaningless in my eyes. That the only thing I hold dear to me are my kawaii waifu's and damage/second. They looked upon me as if I had the brain cells of a chalkboard. He exclaimed "You do know you could use an auto-clicker". I looked, puzzled at the words the inferior one had mentioned. I, with much interest, replied "What is that". Their jaws drop, they tell me of this magical program which clicks for you, much faster and consistently so I could both maintain my waifus/s and my life. I looked upon his now beautiful face and tears ran down my acne-riddled cheeks. I realised that although Sakura Clicker was the only thing I genuinely cared about, I was able to play it without vegetating at my desk. The colour came back to my previously black and white life. My family rejoiced and my friends cheered. I had gone from a degenerate with no friends, wasting away with his pants around his ankles listening to consistent moans from innumerable waifu's, to a degerate with friends wasting away after school hours.\n\nWho would have known that this game would both ruin and destory the foundations of my life, but also rebuild and make a much more beautiful life for all to enjoy?\n\nNew Rating: 9/11. Able to be enjoyed by those willing to discard their lives and those who only wish to discard their dignity.","August 7, 2015","true","227.2"," 679 of 743 people (91%) found this review helpful 1,042 people found this review funny","91","679","743","042","85"

One thing that the Sakura games were missing were sound effects. This game finally lets us hear voice recorded Japanese pain sounds (or as you would call it "org@sms"). The background music is also nice and blissful.\n\nGameplay:\nYour goal is to click on enemies and collect gold. Simple as that. Aside from that, you can use the gold you earn to purchase upgrades.\n\nMy strategy: Grip the mouse with your non-dominant hand and use your 2 fingers with your dominant hand (That's not a sex reference) and alternate fingers to click 2x faster than using one hand and one finger.\n\nIs this porn?\nNo. I'll say it again. No. There is no nudity, just suggestive fanservice.\nOk, maybe the sound effects could be considered porn.\n\nIs the game Pay2Win?\nThis game has cosmetic DLC, most of which are just $1. There are some very overpriced in-game upgrades that require a ton of in-game earned gold. However, I found myself doing fine without them. (You can't die in this game)\n\nShould you buy it?\nWhat am I saying? This game is free. Give it a try. It wouldn't hurt right?\n\n- Psychii <3","July 30, 2015","true","12.3"," 315 of 376 people (84%) found this review helpful 105 people found this review funny","84","315","376","105","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mutual/recommended/383080/","mutual","Mutual","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mutual/","418 products in account","Sure, many people will look at this game as a 'hurr boobs' or 'lol hentai 10/10 gotyay' but this review aims to look at the pros and cons of 'Sakura Clicker' and trying to analyse the subliminal messages of the game and what the developers and designers tried to get across to the audience.\n\nFirstly, when you start the game, we are greeted with two half naked girls. My first impression was to be immidietely confused as to what was before me, as endless sands, as far as the eye can see, streched beyond in the background.\nI soon found out that the girl on the right was in fact an image of the main protagonist of the game, whom is not named. This was probably done by the designers to further give the player a sense of confusion as the game started, but later grew aware of the situation before them.\nAfter hours upon hours of trying to figure out what was going on in front of me, I noticed that I could, in fact, click on the screen to deal damage to a red bar that said 'Anubis'. From my understanding of Greek mythology, I had a grasp on what the God looked like, but he was no where around. Once again I felt confused, and I must give it to the designers for this amazing design choice. Bravo.\nNever the less, I regained consciousness and continued to click as I observed the red bar slowly departing. As the red bar was vanquished, so was the girl on the left. I think this was done this way to symbolise that our time on earth is not unlimited and that when our red bars vaporise from existance, so do we, as human beings. With the sudden departure of the girl on the left, another took its place.\nI was blown away by this design choice, as this was now a different girl called 'Boar'. This was clearly a design choice to show that even when the old die, the young take their place in society and shows that the way our society works nowadays is that we follow in each other's footsteps.\nI do not think that I am a genius in any way, but I know I can't possibly fathom what the designers and developers were thinking, though I have a fair understanding of their clear and some what readable subliminal messaging. Just like Stanley Kubrick with his master piece 'Citizen Kane', there are multiple layers of meanings here that I have yet to even scratch the surface of.\n\nEither way, I continued relentlessly and strived forward towards some visible goal. I have yet to find one. But I click never the less. For what purpose...\n\nTo conclude, this game is more than just 'ecchi boobs' and 'half naked females'. Mind you, it might look that way to the naked eye, but the masterful designers and developers of this marvelous project clearly left subliminal messages about the way the world is today and the society we live in. I share this message with you as I can clearly see between the lines and have educated myself on the importance of the message that 'Sakura Clicker' is trying to portray with its excellence.\n\nI have to go now, my parents said I'm only allowed to use the computer for 2 hours a day because I watch too many Japanese cartoons.

Here is an honest review.\n\nThis game sucks, it sucks as a money grabber, it sucks as a clicker game and it sucks off its' fanbase...not litteraly of course...\n\nSo why do I have almost 70hrs in it?  Simple answer, auto clicker when afk, longer answer to see if there was anymore to it.\n\nThe simple fact is if you open the game, click once on the anime chick a couple time til she moans to death and sprays out a coin or two, you have seen the entire game, that is it, you completed the game.  There is nothing more than to upgrade everything so you can click harder and faster.  Steam's summer sale clicker game had more game into it than this piece of trash.\n\nThe real ♥♥♥♥ off is the DLC for this game.  You buy a paperdoll for $1 and now since last update some even more "revealing" paperdolls, almost $2.  Way to milk your fans guys.  But I'm assuming most people do not know this and think there is more to it than just your anime character on the right wearing something different.  But there isn't.\n\nYa the artwork is as great as all their stuff is but there is nothing to strive for, even the clicker games that came out before this one had more depth and reason to it.\n\nFree is free and take that for what it is worth, but we all don't line up outside to get free spoiled eggs do we?  I can honestly say it is not worth your time to put in any effort even "afk effort".  You are better off with a much better clicker game to waste your afk time on.","August 11, 2015","false","67.9"," 472 of 629 people (75%) found this review helpful 59 people found this review funny","75","472","629","59","51"

Sakura Clicker is that in video game form. The idea is idiotically simple, click on sexy anime girls, who wince and cry out in pain while you do, until you kill them and earn gold. Repeat until the end of time. But this game, like other clicker games, is one giant skinner box technique but unlike Adventure Capitalist, I actually played it for longer than five minutes. My experience went into three stages.\n\nStage 1: Incredulity\nAs I began playing, it was almost too stupid to comprehend. You click on the girls until their numbers go down and they die, you scoop up the gold and it was hard to believe that more people were playing this than Lord of the Rings Online or Defiance, F2P titles with actual gameplay. Maybe it was the admittedly well-designed anime girls, but that's even worse because there are multiple hentai sites where people can see the whole thing instead of this ecchi skinner box. Stage one was probably the best time to write the game off, but I didn't.\n\nStage 2: Complacency\nAround Zone 4, the game enters a bit of a lull. Your characters become powerful enough to where you don't have to do anything other than scoop up the gold. This is the part of the game that you could literally play one-handed. Eventually, you get into a routine where you sit around and collect the gold, only moving the mouse away from the play field to keep your characters up to speed. This is where the sexy nature begins to come in. The characters moan in a highly sexual fashion as you're clicking the ♥♥♥♥ out of them and the enemy character designs become quite appealing, minus the cancerous white spots on the top of the breasts. You enter a zen-like state where the only thing that matters is keeping your DPS up.\n\nStage 3: Chemical High\nAround Zone 7, that power creep dimishes greatly and you as the player have to become more active. Eventually, the difficulty increases to the point where you're back to clicking as fast as you can because your other characters have lost their edge. Your senses begin to highten, going back and forth between the battlefield and your character sidebarn as you struggle to keep up with the difficulty spike. Especially once you get the gold rush move for your main character, filling the play field with gold like you just won the Megabucks jackpot in Vegas. By this time, the skinner box is in full effect. I ended up hurting my fingers with all the clicking, which is not the way I would have expected the average SC player to hurt their wrist. I gave myself temporary RSI over freaking anime boobs. Somehow I pulled myself away, probably to give my hand a break.\n\nAfter taking a break to write this review, the idea of spending nearly an hour on this game is beginning to sink in. Imagine the things a person could do in an hour. One could watch a great TV show, read a chapter in a enlightening book, anything other than clicking on anime boobs. Yet, I'm probably not going to uninstall the game and the no vote is a very borderline one at that. I can see myself coming back to this with a beer in hand, just looking for very basic gameplay to give me a brief rush. But that begs the question, am I playing Sakura Clicker or is Sakura Clicker playing me? I spent a bunch of time writing a narrative review at one in the morning for a ♥♥♥♥ing clicker game so the latter might be true. In short, I have no idea why I played it but I did.","October 4, 2015","false","0.8"," 162 of 213 people (76%) found this review helpful 106 people found this review funny","76","162","213","106","3"

The art is lovely and the suggestive sound effects are pretty hot, but there's absolutely no substance to this game whatsoever. You click. You level your "party" up, which means you have to click slightly fewer times on each picture before a new one appears. You repeat until you expire from sheer boredom, or until you accept that there really is nothing more to this and quit out, never to return. (It took me 9 minutes, which is probably at least 8 minutes longer than it deserved.)\n\nI realise this lack of substance is the entire point of "clicker" games, but come on; I think the "joke", such as it is, has probably run its course now.\n\nIf you must hear scantily-clad anime girls moaning and screaming, there are plenty of better places -- both interactive and non-interactive; explicit and non-explicit -- to get that particular brand of delicious thrills.

That... uh, okay.\n\n---\n\nThe Blurb\nA clicker combat game where you, the player, are a swordswoman facing a variety of fantasy monsters in your quest for... gold, I think.  "Titilation" seems to be the order of the day, however, as most of these 'monsters' appear to be anime women dressed in a variety of fetishwear.\n\nThe Good\nProbably the biggest thing I could point out is that it, like many things on the internet that involve less than standard clothing levels, is free, and unlike many of the aforementioned sites it actually just delivers on what it promises.  This is a clicker game where you fight monsters.\n\nThe game models are not unpleasant to look at - typically, they are buxom and present a large variety of costumes, from slimes to sphinxes to panda bears to succubi.\n\nAs the game progresses, you can purchase additional swordswomen, female monks, berserkers, etc, as though men don't actually exist in this fantasy world of nearly naked vixens doing bloody battle.\n\nOnce you log out, the game continues to track what you should have been doing for battle, and rewards you accordingly.\n\nThe Bad\nSakura Clicker manages to miss the mark between 'hentai game' and 'safe to play at work', leading to some rather evocative sound effects and scantily clad women all over your screen.\n\nOn the topic of the sound effects, the 'combat' seems to evoke 'monster' commentary and vocal responses far more akin to being in an adult site than a battle game.  There seems to be a limited number of voice actors sourced, leading to the game being fairly repetitive after a short time.\n\nFor content, Sakura Clicker misses out on really any substantial combat.  It doesn't matter where on the window you click, so aiming does not seem to matter.  There's only one or two special clicker buttons to strike at, which can lead to a tedious number grind with minimal effort.\n\nThe monster AI is nonexistent, they make no attacks, and even the timed 'boss battles' don't result in any repercussions for failure, taking the little bit of challenge left.\n\nBackdrops did not change for a substantial time, leaving a bland desert dune as the only other thing to look at, and there's only two cells to the monsters - idle, and 'struck'.\n\nBy only including women as both protagonists and antagonists, the developers have forced themselves into a corner away from men of alternate sexuality while at the same time throwing a troll bone to the easily offended female potential audience.\n\nThe Ugly\nA cosmetic cash shop and a link to Patreon.  I could accept the first part if that was all there was, but double-dipping is a no-no.\n\nSuggestions\nAs Ubisoft recently learned, models of a different gender are not actually that hard.\n\nEither reduce the adult content, or actually follow through by making it adult content.  By trying to hedge the bets, they make a game that is not safe for work, while only barely skimming the mark needed to deserve that flag.\n\nAny form of interaction - enemies having attacks, the need to click at said incoming attacks, needing to strike vital points as they become available, would give this play value.\n\nThe Summary\nThe developers could have taken a bit of personal risk by making this an actual adult game, and worked from there accordingly, or they could have taken a more serious approach to the clicker combat style and added enemies that fight back, look like enemies, and added more substance.  Instead, they did neither, and the result is Sakura Clicker, and that result feels less like a completed product and more like an ideas pitch for a game without said actual game.\n\nIf you are looking for a casual game with some NSFW titilation without being pornographic, this is a game you could enjoy.  If you are wishing to enjoy something hentai, if you desire to play a game in your workplace, if you are offended by blatant objectification of women, or if you are looking for something with content, then this is not the game for you.\n\n4/10, for being a below-average clicker game with some (albeit not many) decent graphics, though much more effort could have been put in no matter which way you slice it.\n\n---\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group\n\n*Credits to George Takei and courtesy to "anythinghorror".","August 7, 2015","false","2.2"," 81 of 111 people (73%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","73","81","111","5","5"

Excessive display of skin, but no nudity.\n\nIt's free, and has steam cards. You should be ok with your friends laughing at you, and be ok with embarrassment too.\n\nGraphics are ok, some backgrounds are really pretty too. The girls you fight have some variety in costumes, some of them aren't too bad. There are a few costumes that cover more of the body, but all of the girls have an unrealistic body shape, which is the main selling point. Clearly it's marketed towards lovers of a very specific bust size.\n\nI enjoyed the voices the most. There are several voice actors - it depends if you bother with clicking or letting the computer auto-attack as to how often you'll hear the voices as they depend on critical hits and defeats. Gameplay resembles the Steam summer sale minigame from 2015, as the levels increase so too does your damage and enemy health, exponentially rising into the thousands, millions, billions, trillions, then something called 'aa' which is possibly a Scrooge McDuck money bin the size of a planet.\n\nAdditional skills and party members can be purchased to keep your damage comparable to the enemies' health.\n\nGet it if you want to check out the art, or want the cards - but I don't recommend playing it for extended periods, it gets repetitive too quick. Possibly ok with your morning cuppa for 5 minutes, but that's all. 6/10 for something to do between other somethings.\n\nFinal note: Always remember there are female gamers on Steam. Don't disrespect them, realise that the girls depicted here are ridiculous, smile then move on.","December 3, 2015","true","10.9"," 42 of 51 people (82%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","82","42","51","9","8"

I've been lost for so long; oh, to be ♥♥♥♥ing young again. Anyway, I tried doing something to take my mind off of my own existential pain, so I looked in the free to play games. I first tried Dirty Bomb, but for some reason, my laptop really, REALLY doesn't like anything that runs on any Unreal Engine that isn't 2 or even 2.5, so I uninstalled that moments later. Then, I tried this game instead, and holy ♥♥♥♥, I'm so ♥♥♥♥ing glad I got this instead.\n\nNever in my life have a seen a game that was so well made in every department. Graphics are a 10/10 easily, the story is absolutely masterful; it blows that overrated peice of donkey splooge "The Last of Us" out of the water, the soundtrack is FANTASTIC, and the gameplay is so amazing. This game just drops you into the fray right away, no wimpy, annoying tutorials. This is not only the best free-to-play game on here, this is, without a doubt, the best game EVER! This isn't just game of the year, it's game of the MILLENIUM.\n\nAnd the one thing that really makes this game of the millenium? Well, this game came to me in a time where I was really lost in life. I was just ready to end it all. I'm writing this review as a completely changed man. This game pushed aside all of my negative preconceptions about life and acted as a beacon of light and a voice of reason when there hasn't been one in such a long time.\n\nThis game really made me realize something, everybody. The key to happiness, the  MEANING  of life is not family, it's not marriage, and it isn't even having a successful job and careeer. It's not about having tons of money, or going to the farthest ends of the Earth to discover something truly mind-blowing and revolutionary. The key to happiness is:\n\nBIG ANIME BREASTS!\nI'm not giving this game a score of any McLovin's this time around. There isn't a number in the world that could properly display how amazing this game is. It blows EVERYTHING out of the water. ♥♥♥♥ Undertale, Five Nights At Freddys, Fallout 4, whatever Call of Duty or Assassin's Creed came out this year, THIS IS THE GAME THAT HAS CHANGED NOT ONLY MY OUTLOOK ON GAMING, BUT MY OUTLOOK ON LIFE!\n\nGET IT  NOW","December 4, 2015","true","2.9"," 24 of 25 people (96%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","96","24","25","23","2"

My uncle introduced me to this game on launch, and let me say, I'm glad he did. First of all I wanna talk about how this game completely takes apart, and puts back together the clicker genre in a magnificent way. There's no other games that quite have the same elgant charm as Sakura Clicker and frankly, I doubt there will ever be. I love to just sit back in the living room and throw this in on the tele and just sit back with my family and just embrace its glory. For anyone looking for a Birthday present this year to give to their offspring, I without a doubt recommend this game 100%. Honestly, the first time I saw this game, my pet rat and I (Charles) were quite hesitant, judging by all the negative reviews we had seen. But then when we actually took the time to accept this game for what it was, I think everyone was in a better place. At times I'll wander into my room and come across Charles on his own playing this game, and then look back at the time and see he'd been there for hours. So all in all? Sakura Clicker is a perfect game for you, your uncle, your Rat, and really, the whole world. God bless you all.","August 14, 2015","true","0.2"," 33 of 42 people (79%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","79","33","42","35","5"

They're asking for it!" no.. no they're not.. that's a VERY sexist way of thinking. For many women, feeling 'sexy' is actually empowering and shows that she has CONFIDENCE in herself.

The voice acting and soundtrack is off the chain "tru" -2chainz. As I started the game, I was thrust into the action. The simplicity of this game makes it super casual, and even my little sister got the hang of it within seconds. Late game had me hard pressed, on whether I should upgrade one thing or another. It is extremely satisfying as you beat off the hardest of bosses. If you find little to no challenge in this game, I highly recommend picking up the Striped Bikini DLC as it drastically changes the plot.

The characters change from Bear, Boar, etc. at first to Slime, Harpy, Plant, Mud, Sheep and Dragon, etc. and the background never changes.\n\nTo make this worse you basically get 4 haircuts and a few hair colors besides Ginger and then the eyes may change with a few faces... The custom character selection is worse than skyrims ugly old woman graphic glitch and the one race you may have is Neko.\n\nOnce you hit lvl 600 after grinding for a good 10 hours or whatever (I'm in 300 right now) you restart the freaking game with souls or whatever.\n\nThen you get to spend 10 more hours to get 5 more so you can pick up more gold.\n\nThis is an awful game, awful clicker... It's annoyingly repeative and the moaning is so freaking fake I ended up just muting it. Seriously, this is the lowest of the low.\n\nI give it 2/10 mainly for the art.\n\n\n~ Suggestions:\n\nAdd more hair colors, add more facial features, add more eye colors, add more playable races.\nAdd more background, Add levels, Add speech bubbles perhaps.\nBalance the game out, the jump from Million to Trillion was not pleasent.\nAdd achievements, Add Cards, Add total amount of clicks.","July 29, 2015","false","7.4"," 40 of 63 people (63%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","63","40","63","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jadarma/recommended/383080/","Jadarma","Jadarma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jadarma/","267 products in account","OverviewSakura Clicker is another free to play, boring to win clicker game, with the only twist being instead of cartoony monsters, now you click anime "kawaii" invisions of animals... In a nutshell, this game expects you to click chicks to get money to buy chicks to help you click chicks to get more money to upgrade your chicks so they click chicks faster. No new concept, no original elements that are not found in other similar games.\n\nThe Pros:It's free - Clicker games wouldn't get any popularity if they asked for money to play. That being said, feel free to try it, although I don't feel like it will satisfy you (no innuendo intended)\n\nNot much interaction required - After a maximum hour of clicking, the damage over time you deal is sufficient enough to not require you to click. Also, when you close this for a few hours / day(s) and you get back, you will find yourself 10000% richer than when you left, so upgrading requires minimal effort.The Cons:No Inovation - Except the ♥♥♥♥, there is nothing different about this game that is not present in other clickers. Same 10 enemies / stage, same type of passive upgrades, same random chest events, nothing makes this stand out from the rest.\n\nEnemy Diversity - Stages don't have themes, so you'll see the same 15-20 girls randomly being recycled. All of them have the same voice, but I guess they know people who would download this would care about, right?\n\nYour dumb smirk - You can customize your character, which is always displayed on the right side of the screen, doing nothing but showing an inanimate jpeg. Why does this even exist? You'll see in my next few points.\n\nNo animations! - Apart from a few sprites when you click and character shaking like it was a picture move effect in Windows MovieMaker, this game is completely devoid of any animations. The only thing that could count are the gold coins faking physics when they drop.\n\nUseless, overpriced, cosmetic DLC - OK, so you remember that you could customize your character, right? Well, almost. You have very few presets to choose from, and after that there are DLC that cost 0.99 each for a total of about 10 Euros. For, you guessed it, a completely aesthetic, inanimate JPG modificiation of your characters right screen cameo. I guess if all of them costed 0.99 combined, I'd say - good. Give the player something not game breaking so they can show support to the developer, but at this state, it's just trying to milk money off of people.\n\nNo Achievements - I've already stated that this game doesn't bring neither challenges, nor features to the table. It also doesn't have achievements, so when I get bored of the already minimal set of features, I have no incentives to keep playing.\nConclusionI don't like this game, and I can't recommend it. If you wanted a clicker game, there are many better than this, and if you wanted to click on anime girls, there are many better this.\n\nIf you enjoyed this review and want to see more of my work, consider joining my group and follow my curator page!

Yes, technically there is no end, or it so it seemed. But there is...\n\n\nTo get to the end I cheated and got like near 300.00 E+87 gold and brought only Sakura... the strongest warrior. You will use Sakura all the way up to her being Level 5500+ and she'll get you to Zone 300+. To get the rest of the way, Use her at Level 6000 or so and it will actually set your DPS counter to 1 and Well just sit back and watch :(\n\nSadly that after all that is done, you'll get to Zone 322  - 5 and can't go forward. It is actually a bit sad cause by then you have already lost interest in playing the game. Note that you'll likely want artifiacts of damage on allies and all damage as high as you can get them. I'm around Rank 70, Rake 20 for click, and Rank 20 for Ally.\n\nThe game actually breaks at Zone 322 - 5 at the boss. It will register the boss as "NaN/1" for health. Yes, "NaN / 1" so you hit her all you want and do zero damage...\n\nNow, having broken the game or gotten to the preverbial end, I would like there to be a reset button that would even reset artifiacts if people wanted it. But hay its okays...\n\nWould I recommend this game... It's anime, so yes. Will I continue to play it, Yes, but A word for the wise that like this sort of game, do not rush it.

You can choose from 12 different mutants, including Fish, Eyes, and Melting. Sakura Clicker not only is a great first-person shooter, but it's a helpful tool to help people in third world contries learn about computers. Like Norway. Now those Norwegians don't have to worry about the hassle of learning about Photoshop. Sakura Clicker stars an all star cast of Shrek, Sasha Grey, that one older son Will Smith has that no one talks about, and Caribou. Dead or Alive: Beach Volleyball also has lots of creative ways to end your foes and move on to the next level. You can use various masks, such as Richard the rooster, Brandon the panther, and other various animal-themed masks. I give Counter-Strike: Global Offensive a 16/13. Although Half-Life does have some bugs, many of them are minor and do not hurt Minecraft's gameplay.\n","August 11, 2015","true","0.2"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","85","11","13","8","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcnichoj/recommended/383080/","mcnichoj","mcnichoj","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mcnichoj/","1238 products in account","New:\nThe below was originally the highest rated "real" review and was the highest rated 'not recommend' review. Due to the amount of patches that have greatly changed things I have changed my recommendation which reset votes.\nI will write a updated review soon.\n\nOld:\nThere's nothing inherently bad about this game but better ones exist.\nSerious review below, no fun allowed.\n\nGame starts you off with no start screen/menu and with no explanation of anything. Sure you just click but tabs on the side of the screen exist where you can customize your character, buy DLC or change some minor game settings.\n\nThe game itself is very basic, you click to deal damage and buy upgrades to deal more damage as enemies slowly gain more and more health as you progress. Speaking of progression, the game gives you no indication of progression. Yes enemies gain more health but after however long you might have been playing unless you were keeping track it's unknown how many levels you've clicked your way through.\nYou have no health so you can't lose to regular enemies and I have yet to find out what happens when you lose at a boss level as the game allows you to pause a boss level to grind indefinitely against more regular enemies so you can get stronger.\nHere are a couple better clicker games:\n-Clicker Heroes\n-AdVenture Capitalist\n\nIf you're here because you're a Sakura Spirit/Fantasy/Angel fan this game offers plenty of fan service but not much else. You can get your character outfits of the two fox girls from Sakura Spirits and the game features all kinds of moans, groans, and squeels  that will get you to lower your volume in the hopes no one hears it. Aside from the random sounds you'll hear the occasional Japanese "Stop it!" among a few other phrases I don't know.\nGame offers no explanation as to why you're in the middle of a desert clicking big breasted anthro girls to death. Nothing about going to a shrine and travelling to another dimension or demon panty thieves.\nI don't expect story from these types of games but it is a spin-off of a visual novel, so a little explanation would have been nice maybe.\n\nI don't care about the fact the game is including DLC because it's completely optional and is obviously meant to help them work on future games. Don't want DLC? Then don't buy it but if you want them to hurry up with Sakura Spirit 2 then maybe buying a couple 0.99 outfits might help.\nI think it's a little odd the game doesn't include Steam trading cards as that would promote people to buy the DLC and the main game in the series featured trading cards. Hopefully those get implemented down the line.\n\nSorry this isn't a funny review or anything, just wanted to address a few things.\nI'll change my recommendation as soon as they add breast physics.\n\nEdit:\nCards have been confirmed by the developers. Rev up those bikini DLC sales.\nEdit 2:\nA day later patch and they addressed the progression problem, the game clearly states what zone  you have reached. With that I'll change my vote from a thumbs down as it's obvious the devs will continue to improve this game. Leaving my review above as-is for now as most of those problems are still there.","July 29, 2015","true","29.2"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","13","17","3","12"

Where do I even begin?\n\nSakura Clicker is a F2P Clicker game for Windows, OSX and Linux. It has absolutely stunning graphics and cheap DLC to make the game a more erotic experience. It is addictive as it is beautiful, and it had me hooked by area 1-2. So delete your "Cookie Clicker" NONSENSE and give Sakura Clicker a try! you won't be dissapointed (maybe you will after you waste all your money on cosmetic items like I did, but I have NO REGRETS).\n\nOriginally, me and a couple of my mates all downloaded this as a joke. And now I have a neckbeard and I quit my job. And sold my girlfriend to buy cosmetic items in Sakura Clicker to dress my Sakura Clicker avatar (my new waifu) however I please, whether its a Wedding Dress, School Girl Uniform or a Striped Bikini! The possibilities are endless!\n\nThe character designs are absolutely FLAWLESS. I love every single one whether it's a Sheep, Cheetah or even a Dragon! They all have a little section in my heart and I always think of them as I go to sleep as I also think of them when it comes to hands under sheets time.\n\nIn conclusion, I will give Sakura Clicker a 69,001/10. Sakura Clicker will have you hooked and you will come super dependend in the game, not being able to sleep without playing it for at least an hour. P.S. If any of you dev's are reading this, please port Sakura Clicker to Mobile devices.\n\n","December 28, 2015","true","15.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","6","6","3","2"

Big problem for me is that artifacts aren't working properly.  I should have 120% damage increase but statistics show a 0% damage increase.  Also not sure the artifact bonuses are working properly either given that, for many of them, there is no record of their current bonus in the statistics tabs.  Judging by what I CAN see though I'm confident that at the very least the damage increases are not functioning as intended.\n\nBrief Summary:  The ONLY bug fix that I have seen thus far is that the Patreon link built into the game now works.  My guess?  Devs just want to get their money and bail.  And judging by the pledges on their Patreon page many of you are dumb enough to fall for it... you do know that google is cheaper, right?\n\n","April 27","false","684.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

On one hand their visual novels aren't hard to read by any means. I mean, the girls are cute and it's light hearted enough to not take offense to anything. But then they do this thing where every point of view character irks me at a spiritual level.\n\nSee, I'm no ♥♥♥♥♥♥. I was only the Sex Offender world champion from 1975 to 1999. That being said, when women are pretty much rubbing their used panties against your face, I think you have the go ahead.  See, what Sakura clicker does right is that it just kind of gets rid of that fool they force you to learn about in their other products. This time they replaced the self insert male character surrounded by cute girls by making said character a cute girl.\n\nThe game is a clicker, as it says in the title. What you do is click on "monsters" until they're defeated so you can make gold to recruit more heroes to help you fight said monsters. Considering how the monsters react to your attacks I assume that spanking is involved in some way.\n\nThere really isn't much to say about the game other than this. There's a little bit of customization that you can do to your avatar. I added cat ears and a tail to mine so that says something about me.\n\nSakura Clicker isn't for me. I see the appeal in clicker games, and cute monster girls can really take something like this so far for me. My enjoyment of this game was directly tied to the condition of my doodle. Do you enjoy clickers? Then by all means, go nuts. Do you enjoy cute girls with cat ears? Well this will keep your attention for a little bit longer. Other than that, play about 30 minutes, write a fan fiction about the events, make a mess of your keyboard, have yourself a good ol time.\n\nSakura Clicker gets three monsters that won't be my girlfriend out of, I dunno, all of them.\n\nTsujigiri was like the drive by of Feudal Japan.\n\nThe curator: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curation","August 4, 2015","false","0.6"," 17 of 27 people (63%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","63","17","27","10","0"

The character on the right that I suppose is supposed to be you just stands there completely useless and devoid of any life or charm.  Perhaps the worse offender of this poor excuse for a clicker activity is the UI.  It's awful.  There's nothing here except the ability to pay money to dress up a paper doll.

Using motion capture technology, Anthony Frank Hawk became the first man to ever become real life videogames. The game suffers from the limitations of modern technology, but uses the most up to date game engines to create a life like experience. Without using holograms or imprint technology, Tony Hawk was able to recreate the most life like reconstruction of the San Fransisco Bay area to date. In that recreation, the player is able to manipulate the world in ways not previously believed to be acheivable. After over twenty five years in development, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 has mastered skating mechanics, in-game physics, and hip kid lingo. The game delivers on all fronts, and is a worth while buy for anyone looking for great exclusives for the Xbox One. 2 out of 5.","October 24, 2015","true","0.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","86","6","7","5","1"

I've started that nonsensical weeaboo stuff only to get Steam cards, and now I've learned that, despite the fact you can buy those cards and collect badges, there's no way you'll get a drop of it.\n\nAs a game, I can't praise any of "clickers" for anything but two things: 1) It allow me to read some books in peace while the "game" "playing" itself; 2) most of the clickers are free of charge, yet they allow you to build some statistics, like completed achievements. And some of them even have Steam cards!\n\nIn the Sakura Clicker, there are no achievements, and no Steam card drops. More to it, it is the game where you need to induldge yourself for beating some anime-stuff-gals, and after the beating they comes right into your virtual harem... But get me right, this is not a hentai game, gals are somewhat dressed, and you'll never be doing anything but beating them. So take my advice, find a better game! Or see some anime movie, or read a book! Almost everything would be better, than "playing" that "game". Unless you like the process of beating helpless gals, of course. Then you may find this game your haven.\n\nMark 3/10: as a clicker, works fine, but as a game, it is horrendous, in my system of values.","November 17, 2015","false","7.0"," 18 of 31 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","18","31","0","3"

Instead of killing ugly blob monsters and treasure chests with eyes you fight against Manga Hentai chicks which are moaning in Japanese. Ok, they look quite static in the landscape.

Each next zone is harder than the previous. The game is an early stage. But a lot of updates are coming in recently. Hopefully they'll add some achievements later.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cunin/recommended/383080/","cunin","Cunin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cunin/","1448 products in account","I don't know if Clicker Heroes is the first game of that kind, but it certainly is my first, so I consider it as it and compare all the other games to it.\nIf there's one thing done right there, beside the many things, is that it feels honest to you: you never feel cheated on because everything's mathematically correct.\n\nSakura Clicker feels like a rushed game because of many reasons but the progress is certainly one of the worst. You feel like the developers just tried something to see how it goes, without putting much thinking into it.\nMost of the game is a copy/paste of Clicker Heroes (ascensions included) but with all of the functional changes done wrong.\nThis ends up in upgrade cost being too high for the damage dealt, so the only good thing to do is to upgrade each ally 3 to 5 times then wait to buy the next one, and that wait means close the game and come back later. I know that happens to Clicker Heroes too, but here I mean literally play 2 minutes then idle for 5 hours or more. All the time.\n\nSince the aug 3rd update this situation got better, because the devs raised the damage a great lot, but that also proves the fact that this whole thing was just badly planned at the beginning, and it still doesn't feel right.\n\nThis game suffer from many problems, and even though the devs seem to listen to the players and actually implement stuff that most people are asking, that could have be done before releasing it, and anyway we're far from something working right.\n\nIt all feels like a cardboard game, with little to no animations (the only one being the enemies closing their eyes when beaten), just a few 8-bit like sound effects, and a short looping music that will get annoying very soon. The character design is nice but  it is just an excuse to attract people, because that's really the only good thing of this game.\nThat said, those girls are just random, and there doesn't seem to be any pattern in their dressing. Bosses are just the same girls, but stronger.\nYour character is shown on the playfield, and you can change its appearance in a specific tab of the game. Most stuff has to be purchased with real-world money before being able to wear it (like the most sexy dresses), and that's the only thing you can purchase. The problem is that it just stand there doing nothing, so it doesn't really make sense to even be there.\n\nThis game really feels like a quick cash-grab as there's nothing interesting to do while it runs beside purchasing upgrades, which, as I said, isn't really anything strategical since you just purchase the best ally and forget about the rest, so for most of the time you'll just have the game closed collecting money for you.\n\nThe progress is non-existant as you can't really see any beside the small number indicating the level, because the game is always the same: random girls with a new random background every 10 levels.\n\nThe worst thing about this game, though, is that you don't know where you are going.\nOn Clicker Heroes you always have a clear objective, which isn't only to get further than your last ascension but it also gives you some clear short/mid/long range objectives to achieve and a little bonus if you manage to complete them, which are the in-game achievements. You have a reason to go further and a clear objective, and you also see an ending point to reach.\n\nIn this game you don't have any. You just beat these always-the-same enemies for no reason at all, forever.\nReaching further bosses has no meaning either, as they are simply another randomly-dressed girl which gives you nothing more than some coin, as all the other enemies.\n\nI see it as if this game tried to be another clicker with its own identity, but this new identity failed to be attractive and don't even work right.","August 4, 2015","false","6.1"," 23 of 41 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","23","41","2","0"

They're fun perverted visual novels with absolutely Ludacris plots, dialogue, and situations that scream fan service with copious amounts of anime boobs, butts, and the occasional tentacle monster or two. However Sakura Clicker is anything but that. Yes, it does have Anime girls(dressed as animals and Ancient Egyptian gods for some reason - so I guess if you get off to Anubis or Osiris this is the game for you) but that's really it. You click on those Animal/Egyptian god Anime girls to do damage while your character stands awkwardly to the right and watches you. Each Animal/Egyptian God Anime Girl you defeat drops gold which you can use to hire Hero's to help you or upgrade stats and that's basically it. All you end up doing is basically click as hard as you possibly can until your wrist feels like it's about to implode and ending up on the next monster. The game is a never-ending grind fest of just doing that over and over again while facing the same 5ish Animal/Egyptian God anime girls over and over again. So why this game was made you ask? "Oh it can't be that bad, it's free right?” One answer: To sell DLC outfits to thirsty guys that makes your character that stands to the right be wearing a bra made out of a ribbon or something.\n\nPROS\nIt's free\n\n\nThe girls moan when you click them\n\n\nI guess this game could finally quench someone’s thirst who has an ancient Egyptian God fetish\n\nCONS\nPretty obvious the game was made to sell DLC\n\n\nDLC is overpriced (for a dollar it doesn't even change how the monsters look - just the outfit of your character who stands to the left and creepily watches you play this game)\n\n\nGrind fest\n\nConclusion\nSkip over this one. If you really want to play a Sakura game, check any of the other Visual Novel ones out or wait for Sakura Fantasy Chapter 2.\n","July 30, 2015","false","0.2"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","12","20","2","1"

Additionally, Attack Speed was a little broken since (as far as I know from how far I got into the game, about zone 40-45) you could only get attack speed with Spirits, so you'd spend your spirits on Attack Speed and get Damage and Gold Gain from leveling your girls to level 200, 400 or 600.\n\nTaking this minor balancing issue into consideration, the devs decided to murk the entire game and put it into an unplayable state, your clicks matter more and you're able to use an ability to essencially get 100% crit chance (crits now do x10 damage instead of x2, HOWEVER the ability takes 30 minutes to refresh) but now leveling the girls gives barely any damage, and your click damage in the mid to late game is dependant on the damage of your girls (You gain a % of their damage towards your clicks). It now takes hours to defeat some of the earlier bosses that you'd previously be able to beat your first or second try after collecting a small amount of gold.\n\nThe only positive thing I can say is that it's nice that the damage your girls deal to the enemy isn't 'chunky' anymore, and now the enemy health bar slides down. Legitimately the only positive thing I can say.","April 28","false","062.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

There is other things to do like hire more characters who deal damage when you dont click and you can customise your character (with the addition of buying dlc outfits cause its for your customised waifu and you want the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bikini for her). There is also pets and relics what also help with things like bosses and increase stats. in even more simple words this is like the steam summer sale game with the monster trading cards except with the style the sakura series is known for. Do i recommend it? Yes i do cause it is kind of like a distraction or something to do while your bored. I would recommend this game for the people who have played a sakura game before so they know the art style it uses and for people who want to buy the dlc cause they know its worth the money to get a better glimpse at the "plot".","July 30, 2015","true","1.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

For one, you just click the screen. Now sure, the game has "Clicker" in the name. Fair enough. But, why is there only half naked anime monster girls. And this smug ♥♥♥ smiling chick in the side of the screen. I mean what the hell is she even doing there. Ever cat girl meowed, which was repulsive. Speaking of repulsive, i have never been so flacent in my life. My little guy litterally receeded back inside me.\nAt one point I think one of the monster girls said hentai, and i didn't know how to fell about that (sexually and emotionally).\n\nAt this point you're probably asking, "What made you play this game in the first place!?!?! Did u do it just to ♥♥♥♥♥?!?!" that is part of it. The other half was, I was desperate. My wife left me and took the kids. She is now ♥♥♥♥ing the pastor at the local Protestant church. I saw it come up as a recomended game. Now yes, I was in a sleezy motel by myself, hopped up on pain killers and with the barrel in my mouth. I was just about to pull the trigger when it caught my eye.\n\nNow, when I first started playing, i sat their clueless. Nothing was happening, plus the pain killers began to kick in. But as my whole body began numb, I realized if i click the ♥♥♥ of the monster girl on the screen, I attacked it. This was the full game. I even stuck my fingers halfway down my throat to get the pills out of my stomach so I can last just a little longer. And boy, do i regret it. I regret it more than marrying that ♥♥♥♥♥ of a wife. Long story short, this game only kept me alive for an extra 14 minutes. By the time you read this review, I wil be gone. I feel bad for anyone who thought this game was the best game ever. What kind of broken household did u have to live in!\n\nAnd dont get me started on the creators. THEY HAD A ♥♥♥♥ING PATREON ON THE SCREEN! WHO THE ♥♥♥♥ WOULD PAY FOR THIS ♥♥♥♥!\n\nAnd the names of some of the monsters are so generic. One was straight up called mud. Just mud. and it was an anime girl, covered in mud.\n\nBut hey if ur into that stuff i dont judge. I recomend this game to all ages.","February 16","true","0.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","0"

For one, you just click the screen. Now sure, the game has "Clicker" in the name. Fair enough. But, why is there only half naked anime monster girls. And this smug ♥♥♥ smiling chick in the side of the screen. I mean what the hell is she even doing there. Ever cat girl meowed, which was repulsive. Speaking of repulsive, i have never been so flacent in my life. My little guy litterally receeded back inside me.\nAt one point I think one of the monster girls said hentai, and i didn't know how to fell about that (sexually and emotionally).\n\nAt this point you're probably asking, "What made you play this game in the first place!?!?! Did u do it just to ♥♥♥♥♥?!?!" that is part of it. The other half was, I was desperate. My wife left me and took the kids. She is now ♥♥♥♥ing the pastor at the local Protestant church. I saw it come up as a recomended game. Now yes, I was in a sleezy motel by myself, hopped up on pain killers and with the barrel in my mouth. I was just about to pull the trigger when it caught my eye.\n\nNow, when I first started playing, i sat their clueless. Nothing was happening, plus the pain killers began to kick in. But as my whole body began numb, I realized if i click the ♥♥♥ of the monster girl on the screen, I attacked it. This was the full game. I even stuck my fingers halfway down my throat to get the pills out of my stomach so I can last just a little longer. And boy, do i regret it. I regret it more than marrying that ♥♥♥♥♥ of a wife. Long story short, this game only kept me alive for an extra 14 minutes. By the time you read this review, I wil be gone. I feel bad for anyone who thought this game was the best game ever. What kind of broken household did u have to live in!\n\nAnd dont get me started on the creators. THEY HAD A ♥♥♥♥ING PATREON ON THE SCREEN! WHO THE ♥♥♥♥ WOULD PAY FOR THIS ♥♥♥♥!\n\nAnd the names of some of the monsters are so generic. One was straight up called mud. Just mud. and it was an anime girl, covered in mud.\n\nBut hey if ur into that stuff i dont judge. I recomend this game to all ages.","February 16","true","0.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","0"

One of the parts of this game I really enjoyed was the story. There was no clear story ever presented in game, but because of this I was able to use my imagination to create the explanation of why I was fighting a seemingly endless horde of monsters in the middle of the desert. Another thing I really liked about this game was the character customization. While I couldn't figure out how to change my gender, I was greeted with plenty of other customization options such as changing my outfit, hair style, hair color, and even my face. The graphics seemed to be very simple at first, but as I played the game I understood the deeper meaning as to why the enemies looked like what they did. Although there was no tutorial, the controls were very easy to learn and master. The sounds in this game were definitely very pleasing to listen to. The DLC in this game is an amazing addition to the quality of this masterpiece. The developers of this game are true geniuses for making this beautiful work of art. The only thing that could make this game better is online multiplayer, which I'm absolutely sure many people would enjoy. Although I might consider this a revolutionary free to play game, the highest i can give it is 7.8/10 because it has too much water.","August 1, 2015","true","1.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","4","6","3","1"
