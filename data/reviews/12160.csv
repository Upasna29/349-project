"http://steamcommunity.com/id/darezeleon/recommended/12160/","darezeleon","DareZeleon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/darezeleon/","47 products in account","Midnight Club 2, good ol' racing game from the PS2 era and what is considered to be by some fans, including myself, as one of the best Midnight Club games in the series. I'll try to make this detailed without it being too lenthy, so let's get this started.\n\nIf you enjoy racing games on the PC, this is one of those games you should definitely try out, especially since it's normally only $10. Mind you, the game is almost 11 years old as of this review, so comparing it to modern-day racing games and reviewing based on that would be silly, right? For it's time, it's a very fun-filled and possibly addictive game with fast cars and racers who are willing to give you a run for your money, or the occasional cops super speeding to prevent you from winning the race. Three cities, Los Angeles, Paris, and Tokyo, and racers on the streets every night waiting for a challenger to follow them to the start of the race, Career Mode is worthwhile once you get the rivals' cars and break top speeds with them. As you progress, you'll have more access to cars to run around in Cruise in Arcade Mode. The physics are very loose, and to a certain degree, exaggerated, but that only adds to the fun of driving around the streets, dodging traffic cars and clearing checkpoints. There's several other things you can do while playing the game, but I'll talk about that another time. Besides, who doesn't like going at their top speed, hitting the nitrous, and hitting local pedestrians that walk around for you to hit them while racing, or cruising? Don't worry, they all live anyway, even if they don't ever move again. Also, the soundtrack is pretty damn good, and it seems that every racer has their own songs that you'll race in with them, and then listen to later after you beat them. Being an old game, I wasn't expecting the graphics to be as clean as they are. They must've re-added some nice quality textures at some point in the recent years, because it looks very clean for an aged game like this!\n\nEven though the game is very enjoyable to Midnight Club fans, it can be at times annoying difficult, or give you one of those "WTH" moments for anyone. Probably because I still haven't gotten my MC2 Driver's License yet (I might have made that up), I've played this game on the consoles for years, and still tend to find certain parts of the game to be a pain at times, learning the controls on the PC only adds to it. For anyone who plays this game, those moments could be from heavy traffic, hitting poles that stops your car completely and, if you're lucky, send your car's back end up in the air, getting tipped over from cutting certain corners or oversteering with the wrong car at certain terrain, and let's not forget the occasional driver who doesn't use their blinkers before switching lanes. For newer players, you may have to learn the whole track before you can increase your chance of winning certain races, because sometimes checkpoint arrangements can offer too much freedom to where you miss a shorter route or have no clue where to go, or you miss it because you were a few inches away from the checkpoint radius. Oh, almost forgot about the multiplayer! It's...... dead, understandably.\n\nOverall, the game would have to take some getting used to, but it can be very joyful while you do it, especially if you're a racing gamer who just loves driving around in fast cars. And for that reason, I recommend this to those who are into these kind of games! Like I said earlier though, it's an old game, from 2003, so if I see any of you badmouth it and say it's not as good as Need for Speed: Rivals or Most Wanted (either one), I'll take out one of my earned cars from MC2 and run you over with it!\n\nSincerely,\nTotally Not a Die Hard Midnight Club Fan K9_Rage","December 25, 2013","true","65.9"," 69 of 75 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","69","75","0","2"

And a lot of tight streets in the cities of this game require the detailed and quick steering a keyboard can never offer. Maybe the people who are buying hardcore driving simulations already have a wheel but certainly mouse steering should be standard in any game looking to appeal to a broad audience. Because the controls in Midnight Club 2 are simply superb, the game mechanics and driving feel are perfectly balanced for fun and a challenge.\n\nTo start off you might be just holding down the gas the whole way, but eventually with extremely power cars and navigating the city, the driving does feel like actually racing through a living city, just one designed for lots of jumps and high speed cornering. Some cars you will use the brake, others the handbrake instead, but getting around fast is genuinely enjoyable. And with each car having its own style, you get to chose how you'd like to play. The cars get better as the game progresses, making it part of the game to drive a few different cars or seeing how far your favorite car can get you. Once you finish the story, you can start over with all the cars unlocked.\n\nYou get three cities that each have unique neighborhoods with nice feel to them, but more importantly, huge jumps and long curves and straights for racing. The traffic can get in the way a lot of the time, but you can avoid them by going through the jumps or hidden sections of town that cut around underground, making learning the map sometimes a necessary frustration, and sometimes a ton of fun.","March 16, 2014","true","34.0"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","20","21","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lrflew/recommended/12160/","lrflew","LRFLEW","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lrflew/","435 products in account","TL;DR: This might be one of the best Arcade Racers out there. However, the PC port is quite broken. If you play this version, use a 360 Controller, use a keyboard for the menus, make sure to remap the controls to something that makes sense, use driver settings to force AA/AF/VSync if you want them, and be prepared for the occasional crash. If you don't want to deal with these issues, then try to find a copy of the PS2 version.\n\nMidnight Club 2 is the second and (in my opinion) best game in the Midnight Club series. The Midnight Club series has often been compared to the Grand Theft Auto series as they share the same publisher. However, these are two very different game series. Midnight Club is much more focused on being a racing game, whereas Grand Theft Auto is a much more open ended game with a lot more than just racing. This often makes the Midnight Club games a much better racing experience, as all of the development time has been put into making the racing as best as it can be.\n\nThe racing itself is very tight and controlled. There's never any time where you feel like the game isn't responding to your input. The game has you race at very fast speeds, but your turns feel tight and drifting is powerful and fun. Through the early game, you unlock different abilities that slowly increases what you can do in the races. Each of these abilities is simple to understand and is well balanced. All of the abilities, along with the games great control, makes for interesting and varied gameplay.\n\nIt's important to mention the unlocks system in this game. Some games use a shop system that allows you to buy and upgrade cars you like. Midnight Club 2, however, uses a linear unlock system where you unlock new cars by winning races and you don't upgrade cars. This is a different system from other racing games, even other games in its own series, but I think it helps to focus the game. Instead of trying to win races to unlock money to get better cars, you win races for the races themselves. Some people may not like that, but it's one of the reasons I think this game is great.\n\nThe races themselves are open checkpoint style. That means that while you're required to go through all the checkpoints in order, the game allows you to take any path you want between them. This means that finding the right path and shortcuts to take is just as important as driving fast. There are even a handful of races that allow you to hit the checkpoints in any order you want, opening up the game and letting you experiment on what route gives you the best chance to win. This makes it so that when you have to restart a race because you lost, you don't necessarily feel like you are stuck. With maps that allow for a lot of shortcut opportunities and varied routes, there is always another, possibly better route you can try.\n\nThere are three relatively large maps in this game, each one modeled after a different city. Los Angeles is probably the most varied in terms of road types, ranging from small, windy paths to city blocks to high-speed highways to construction sites with lots of ramps to jump off of. Paris has a lot of shortcuts that makes finding your path a lot of fun, along with the catacomb system and numerous large jumps that makes the city feel very open. Tokyo is a bit more mundane than the other cities, but since you get there late in the game when races go well over realistic speeds, you will be happy for the larger roads that makes it easier to dodge traffic and other racers. Each city feels unique, with different environment textures and building making them visually distinct and varied layouts making them play differently.\n\nThe characters in this game fall flat. Many of them are stereotypes from all over the world added in an attempt to make the game feel more worldly. However, this backfires in many places, with the characters often feeling more like caricatures than actual people. However, they really only play a small role in the game, with only short introductory scenes before each race and the occasional and ignorable quip during the races. Luckily, there is no player character, so there's no single annoying character that carries you through the game.\n\nThis game is very difficult, but isn't unfair. This is because the game has a very slow and approachable learning curve. If you've never played a racing game before, this game starts easy enough to get you into it. If you're already a good racer, than you can fairly easily blow through the first easy races and start getting to the more challenging races. If you're really good, then you might need some patience to through the easier races, but trust me, there is a challenge waiting for you in this game. The last few races are brutally difficult and require many, many attempts to beat, but the difficulty smoothly increases, so you never hit any real difficulty spike.\n\nMidnight Club 2 is, in my opinion, the best in the series. Midnight Club: Street Racing (the first in the series) didn't really know what it was doing, having much slower races and no abilities like the slipstream turbo to make the gameplay more varied. Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition suffered in a lot of weird ways. The lackluster upgrade system, a poor sense of progression, and an unnecessary amount of motion blur makes it much less fun to play than its predecessor. Midnight Club: Los Angeles (the forth in the series) is one of the better racing games out there, but suffers from a fairly broken upgrade system that lets you get the best vehicle in the game by the time your half way though, leaving the rest of the game to just be a grind. Midnight Club 2 is also the only game to get a PC port, so none of the other games in the series is available on Steam anyways.\n\nSpeaking of PC ports, this game certainly has some trouble on the platform. First of all, this game needs to be played with a controller. The keyboard controls do not provide the control needed, and the mouse controls are just too awkward to use. However, the controller support in this game is kind of broken. I've had success with the Wireless 360 Controller, so I recommend using that. Some controllers (the PS4 controller for example) causes an odd bug where the menus think that the center of the joystick is the top-left corner, causing the menu selection to uncontrollably scroll. I can't say for every controller out there if this happens or not, so be careful before buying. In addition, the default controller mappings are quite broken, but you can manually remap the controls. Note, however, that it doesn't support "analog buttons", so you can't use the 360 controller's triggers as buttons. Additionally, it lacks many graphical settings, like AntiAliasing, Anisotropic Filtering, and VSync, so you will need to turn them on from your driver if you want them. The game also has a number of smaller issues that may not be worth naming, but can impact your playing experience (some of which is dependent on your resolution). If you want to play this game, but don't want to deal with this port's issues, then I'd recommend playing the PS2 version. There’s also an Original Xbox port, but there’s no compatibility for the 360.\n\nIn the end, I’d recommend this game. It’s one of the best Arcade Racers I’ve ever played, and is even the game that got me into the genre. I do highly recommend you pick it up, but do be weary of the quality of this port.","September 7, 2015","true","76.2"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","1"

It got out in 2003, same year as NFS: Underground and 2 Fast 2 Furious movie came to light, ergo the highest point of the street racing hype. MC2 and Underground were the first succesful big ones to ride that tide.\n\nIn my social circles, at the end it all came down to "which one of the two translates 'dat Fast and Furious feel' better". And this question is a bit trickier than it seems at first. While Underground got that slick visuals and style, bullet proof design (advanced tuning + short but intense races), not to mention being succesful reboot of the huge NFS name, Midnight Club 2 offered much more intricate approach to, well, racing. Which lead to constant creation of different "oh, ♥♥♥♥" moments and accidents. In my opinion, a lot of them added a bit more of the Fast and Furious franchise ferocity than an endless raw of drag racing showdowns from Underground.\n\nBasically, every race in MC2 is a checkpoint rush. A twist - it all happens in a sandbox level. So your route from point to point doesn't matter while you've hit all of them and finished first. Throughout the game, this simple concept is being fumbled with constantly, presenting you each time a race with a slightly different freedom degree - from a "there's the only straightforward route you can take to win" to "here's a bunch of checkpoints on your map, clear them all as fast as you can, using any route or technique AND in any possible order". Dence traffic and AI racers (who also pick different routes) make sure that every race has some degree of chaos, typically. In general, that's it. And you'd be surprised how much fun it can deliver.\n\nAs I see it, there are two major additional points. First, semi-scripted events. Now and then, something happens: say, a truck blocks a way right after that checkpoint. It does that every time in the same way, but what do YOU do with that is, again, up to you. Evade? Drive under it? Make a U-turn and pick a neighbour street? Whatever, just finish first. That and some smart, tight level design (shortcuts, jump ramps etc.) and AI competitors together keep game's chaotic nature fit. No matter how good you know the map and that specific route, every time there's a chance something of the above will intervene, screw everything up and make you rethink your tactics. Such things also spawn those bright, memorable moments, like a car flying just over another car while jumping from the ramp - or crashing into each other and making a huge traffic mess.\n\nSecond, game has bikes and, subsequently, bikes-only and mixed "bikes-cars" races. They present a noticeable shift in gameplay mechanics, although it's more of an intermission for the main cars-only play. Still, bikes have their moments.\n\nSadly, openworld brings the most of MC2's cons, too. Naturally, it's just not that good-looking with all the resource hunger of the big spaces, especially placed near Underground (which is exactly the same age but looks way better). Also, more open space needs more complicated AI, therefore it will glitch, sometimes a lot. There are other problems (e.g. different vehicles are too similar to control, some arcade flicks like two wheels riding feel unnecessary and underbaked), but they are minor compaired to visuals and AI.\n\nStill, in my opinion Midnight Club 2 is a decent game, that brought a lot of hours of fun to me more than 10 years ago. It's core gameplay is solid even now. And while its looks have aged not nearly as well, I absolutely advise to give it a chance. Doubt not, "she's still got it".\n\nP.S. And yes, it works with Windows 7 just fine.","April 3, 2015","true","1.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LonMcGregor/recommended/12160/","LonMcGregor","LonM","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LonMcGregor/","303 products in account","Midnight Club 2 is definitely one of the better of the early-2000s arcade racing games. I originally played it on the PS2, and I must say it has aged well.\n\nThe graphics, to begin with, are definitely not bad. They're nothing to write home about of course, but the texturing is pretty nice, and the only thing that really stands out as being old is the rather blocky look of some of the buildings.\n\nThe controls for the cars & bikes are pretty good. It actually takes a bit of skill to deal with bikes [you will initially find yourself crashinf very easily]. And each of the cars available to unlock will have it's own quirks that you can use to your advantage, once you figure them out. One thing that stands out in this game is that you can actually flip your car in any direction [when it's in the air], and many arcade racers of this era had you stuck horizontal to the ground.\n\nOne of the areas this game is, maybe not bad, but definitely odd, is with the AI. Oftentimes the public traffic seems almost scripted in the way that a massive truck happens to come out of an intersection just as you turn the corner and slam right into it. Or it might just be coincidental. This seems pretty neat at first, but it soon gets a bit tiring as you know it's going to be coming, so you can plan it away in advance.\nAlso, the opponent AI is strange. They seem very apt to crash and swerve into traffic at when they go at high speeds [altough it's worth noting you can set the difficulty of the game manually, see the game guides and forums for details on this]. And in the "free roam" races, I find that regardless of which route you take, the opponents do worse if you're following them. Which makes me think that they're unaffected by traffic if you're not there to make it render. A bit of  ahandicap for you as the player, but I guess it just adds a challenge.\n\nAlso, if you're going to use a controller, you may have a hard time navigating the menus. If you're using an xbone|360 controller, hold DPAD L+D, and use X to select items. You'll know what this means when you get to it. Alternatively, look into xinput to keyboard mapping software.\n\nSo to summarize that, this is definitely one of the better "old arcade racing" games, but it's obviously got its problems. If you're only interested in newer stuff, then avoid it, but if you don't mind it being slightly dated, then go for it. You'll have fun.","November 17, 2015","true","15.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

You'll enjoy this game more if you have the "MODern Editiion" mod on it. Cars transforms into their actual real life selfs with their actual names, Cars are twice as fast, adds 4 unqiue vinyls, rims, colors, and a great custom hud.

What you're looking at here is wild speed boosted racer with TONS of replay value w/ plenty of 23 cars to choose from, races, courses, game modes, in three cities (Los Angeles, Paris and Tokyo), which also applies to the (pretty dead) online mode which also increases the amount of replay value with custom races. It's insanely easy to pick up and play with no kind of learning.\n\nStory Mode / Carrer Mode in this game isn't exactly 'story' based, nor connected to anything, you rather just beat challenge by challenge in order to progress with better cars and move to other cities. The further you get, the more cars you have unlocked and ready to use in any game mode.\n\nRacing in this game is a very arcade like experience, 'wonky' steering, air physics, and etc. Races are checkpoint powered (which is obvious) which can go from head to head racing to beat the clock racing. Sometimes their'll also be races where you're able to choose your own path to get to one checkpoint and back to the start. The map design also helps. In LA to Tokyo, you have cities that are filled with hidden paths, shortcuts, and alt paths to help you race to victory.\n\nThe sound in this game is very basic, but it's what'd you expect in a racing game. There's a very nice and memorable soundtrack collection in this game (as long as you have love for Electronic and Rap / Hip Hop) that differs from all three Cities. LA with Hip Hop / Rap and Electronic / House, Paris with House / Techno (that's a genre guise), and Tokyo with Trance / Hard Dance and some ambient tracks. (Please correct me if I'm wrong about the genres!)\n\nThe enviroment and graphical capabilities isn't much compared to now, but it was something very nice in 2003. The frame rate isn't hard locked (I don't recall it being hard locked at least), shiny cars, detailed enviroments, and so on.\n\nWhat makes me so happy about this game though, is the evolution of Midnight Club. Midnight Club: Street Racing was a pretty damn mediocre racing game but was addicting to play, though it was just missing tons of features and was very slow. What I really love is that Angel Studios (which is now Rockstar San Diego) completely upgraded the code of the original game which managed to turn into this, and I love the direction they went, and how much the production value of the game went up compared to the last they had.\n\nYou should also check out the latest Midnight Club game if you own an Xbox 360 or PS3, Midnight Club: Los Angeles. (which I wish was on PC....I hope they make another on the PC platform!)\n\nNow, as I said in the original review:\n\nBuy it. It's fun, original, and it's worth what you're paying even for a 2003 video game.","August 7, 2013","true","20.3"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","13","23","0","7"

My main problem with it is that in career mode, the checkpoints are spaced really far apart - so far that there's no obvious path connecting them, and if you don't learn the faster paths, you're not gonna win the harder races. So it becomes a tedious series of retries and following CPU racers until you start memorizing the route they take, because they usually take all the good shortcuts (which aren't marked on the minimap). I found it annoying and more time-consuming than it needs to be.\n\nCircuit mode was all right, though. The checkpoints are plentiful and always point directly to the turns you need to take and it's easy to win races with reflexes and steering skill alone. I don't know why they didn't stick to that type of gameplay for career mode. Unfortunately Circuit mode only takes a couple of hours to complete at most. Career mode, however, takes up over 10 hours so it's clearly the meat of the game and it's awful, so I've got to give this one a negative rating.","August 25, 2014","false","13.0"," 3 of 17 people (18%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","18","3","17","0","0"

It really depends of what you prefer.\n\nThe lack of car customization disappointed me. I really like costumizing my own car, and it's always the special feature to me for racing games. But it doesn't have it because the cars are already modified so you can race the bosses.\n\nThe game itself is ok. You have to earn the cars on career mode, not only to drive them there, but on the arcade mode. If you're a person who likes challanges, this is a cool thing. But if you want the immidiate thing on arcade mode, this kinda sucks for you.\nIf you have your driving settings for keyboard, the steering is pretty immediate. It's very different if you're used to drifting (you can also drift if you press the spacebar while steering).\n\nBut that is all there is to it, to me.\n\nI own Midnight Club 3 Dub Edition Remix and it's FAR better, there's no comparison. It's KIND OF like Portal and Portal 2. The second is far more developed and has much better quality and gameplay (not to mention the soundtracks on MC3). Except I wouldn't not recomend Portal.\n\nSo here you go folks, I recommend acquiring this only if it's ever free on sale. I got it on sale for 2,75 and I'm super disapointed.\nBut of course, if you have your own strong reasons, buy it.","June 29, 2014","false","0.8"," 2 of 15 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","2","15","0","0"

Naturally this market was dominated at the time by Need for Speed and Gran Turismo so it had to offer something unique to the table.\n\nUnfortunately it doesn't really do anything particularly unique. It doesnt have car customization, a track editor or anything to make it stand out. Its graphics also look dated for the time, considering Need for Speed Most Wanted came out 2 years later and looked infinitely better.\n\nIt also features a lack luster stereotypical soundtrack.

There's a lot of racing to be done in this game, but the controls feel a little too...arcade-y for me to enjoy, and there's no real sense of speed at all. Graphically, the game is sub-par even given the time it came out, the audio leaves something to be desired, and the AI? They're almost perfect to a fault. I thought maybe it was some form of rubber band mechanics that existed, but they just drive really well. There is absolutely zero room for error, unless you can take them out.\n\nOverall, I've played much better racing games, and this one should be left to die.","April 22, 2014","false","1.5"," 0 of 12 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","12","0","0"

You can try to play this game, but it is horribly frustrating because the cars oversteer horribly, controls are imprecise and neither of these can't be adjusted. The only possible solution might be console controller for PC, but most of us PC gamer's don't own that usually useless device and therefore this game is unplayable to majority. I am sometimes maybe even too persistent and kept playingwith keyboard as long as I could but the AI drivers in this game are very good and that combined with horrible controls means that sooner or later the game becomes impossible to proceed any further.\n\nThe gameplay itself was relatively identical to the Midtown Mandess series and was ok, but due to the utterly outdated graphics I don't believe that I would have enjoyed the game even if the controls had worked.\n\nGrade: 0/10 due to being unplayable at least without controller and even if the controls had worked I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone.\n\nEDIT1. Why this review has received so many thumbs down from audience? It is a fact and not an opinion that this game is unplayable with keyboard. So, next time someone gives this review thumbs down, please leave a comment. If you don't know how to leave comment, follow this short tutorial: Click the big red thumb down button that I gave to this game. This brings you to new window (unless you are already in the whole view full review mode) where there is a field below this review into which you can write your comment.\n\nEDIT2: Finally someone (in this case user named Ƨcotch) commented this review and according to him the demo of this game was playable with keyboard. There isn't a demo availalbe on steam (at least at the time I was writing this on 15.1.2014) but here is a link for the demo on Rockstars' website http://www.rockstargames.com/midnightclub2/downloads.html\n\nAnyways I find it odd that someone could find the handling accpetable. Below are some quesses for possible explanation:\nA) In the demo the keyboard controls are not broken. (I didn't play the demo so I don't know)\nB) The cars in demo are so slow that they are possible handle to at least some degree. (I remember that the handling was really bad but the game was not totally unplayable in the beginnning of the game because cars were slower as well as AI drivers. Situation changed as the campaing progressed)\nC) The game works with some keyboards and is totally broken on others.\n\nThe truth can be any combination of these or maybe something else. Anyways below are some links that I read long ago when I last time played this game. I tried every tip that they contained to fix keyboard handling but they didn't help at all. I had forgotten that some comments in the linked threads claimed that the game actually was playable with keyboard to them, so case C may have some truth in it.\nhttp://www.rage3d.com/board/showthread.php?t=33760759\nhttp://www.rage3d.com/board/showthread.php?t=33699952\n\nAnyways, my thanks for Ƨcotch for commenting this review which allowed me to know the possible reason why this review is getting so much negative votes. If someone else has other explanations, please comment.","November 26, 2013","false","14.9"," 8 of 30 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","8","30","0","8"

I enjoyed it then and I'm happy to see it on Steam. Start out with racing local street racers and win your way up to the main opponents and become the greatest racer. Oh and when and if you get this game, here's a tip: USE A GAMING PAD (for me I use an XBox 360 controller). Playing on the keyboard makes the steering very toughy and jerky, making for not-so smooth turns. And here's a free gift to you:\n\nCheat Code:\nrimbuk - unlocks ALL cars and cities in ARCADE MODE ONLY.

Getting a 360 to work with the game, on the other hand, is not so simple -- the game doesn't recognize the triggers on the controller.\n\nThe game itself is fairly similar to Need For Speed: Underground aesthetically, with Burnout-style open world racing instead of NFS's closed tracks. Looks dated obviously, but does support 1080p widescreen and can run with uncapped framerates, so it runs pretty smoothly at 144Hz.","April 13, 2013","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I, like many of you reading this, have played 100s if not more video games in my lifetime. Many have stood out, made me emotional in a both posotive and negative way and have drawn 1000s of hours out of me. Midnight club 2 on the other hand is something else something that does all that but more. Have you ever done something or been somewhere or experienced something that you loved  and it kept dragging you back for more but you never knew why well thats this game. As a kid I rented it about 5 times before i eventally got it for keeps not really knowing why i was addicted to it. I poured my heart and soul into the game. I loved the cities especially in the free roam mode at dawn with no traffic or pedestrians leaving the mysterious  city of L.A empty only to echo the sound of a roaring exhaust as it hangs on for dear life on the undrneath of a supercar as it drifts in and around the bulidings which sit empty in the the erie early morning fog just as the sun makes it apperance. Or the story mode with an abundance of cocky characters who know all of the streets back alleys and shortcuts and will try every dirty trick in the book to beat you to the last checkpoint as it dances in the  distance of the dark street. Or even just the ominus music at the main menu making you marvel at the beauty of this creation.

Either way, it's interesting to see a game doing the whole 'open world racing' thing before the likes of Burnout Paradise or Forza Horizon made it cool.","February 20","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
