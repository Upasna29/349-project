This isn't completely true, but that also does not mean this game isn't worth your time.\n\nResident Evil Revelations primarily focuses on Jill Valentine before the events of Resident Evil 5. Chris has gone missing (which if Claire has anything to say on the matter, is not an uncommon thing), and a distress signal has been sounded off on a cruise ship left out on a stormy sea. Jill, and new-comer Parker, go in to investigate. And what commences is probably one of the cheesiest plots to exist in the whole series. Resident Evil being cheesy isn't anything new, but this is usually a result of voice acting or nonsensical doors. The plot of the game is just ridiculous, with over-the-top plot twists, extravagant characters even by the series standards, and almost feels like it's convoluted for the sake of being convoluted. But that's not to say it's bad. In a B-Horror sense it's actually rather entertaining, but I suggest you don't come to this game for some deep drama or serious tale and take it for the off-the-rails ridiculous story that it is.\n\nThe game is split into 12 episodes, which in part have two parts each. Typically in each episode, you'll play one part of it as Jill in the 'present', exploring the ship and its horrors. The other half changes chapter-per-chapter of what it contains, but typically it stars some other character, either in the present or at some other time, doing something somewhere else that's somehow important to the story. These chapters are usually notably more action-packed than Jill's chapters, and honestly they're usually not quite as good as Jill's chapters either, but they're not terrible. And as the game has an episodic structure, episodes usually end off with a cliff-hanger, and when you start the next episode, it starts amusingly off with a, "Previously, on Resident Evil Revelations..." recap.\n\nThe game plays sort of like Resident Evil 4 or 5, but there are differences to the system here. Firstly, the first big difference you may notice are the enemies. The Oozes, are what they're called, and they don't just look different, they chug along, waving their bodies all over the place making them a bit hard to hit. On top of this, they respond different to being shot than, say, Ganado or Majinni. And this takes a bit of adjusting too. Basically, the Oozes are hurt most in the head, but shooting them in the head doesn't actually stun them (and they won't explode in this game, either). It's actually sometimes far more worth your time to shoot their arms or legs. Oozes can lose use of their limbs temporarily, and can be noted when their limbs are damaged and unusable as they dangle around once damaged enough. If you shoot the legs of an Ooze, it'll start crawling around. Shoot an arm off, and it won't be able to use attacks with that arm for a time. Shoot both arms off, and the enemy will be stun-locked, letting you run-in and melee the enemy. Unlike RE4 or 5, you can hold-down the melee button to charge it up for a more powerful melee strike.\n\nThere's other changes too that lead to the game feeling different. There's no red herbs, or first-aid sprays, only green herbs in this game, and they're full heals in the title so its often worth holding onto them until you're almost dead. The game has some swimming sections, where you can't shoot your gun but just swim around the flooded areas and make sure to get air every once in a while. You have an item scanner, which you mainly use to find hidden items or scan enemies to fill a percentage (as when it reaches 100%, it gives you a free green herb and resets itself back to 0%).  All of these changes lead to this feeling like a very different sort of game.\n\nThe ship is atmospheric and moody, and while linear, does contain the sort of back-tracking and key-collecting you'd expect. Puzzles are underplayed unfortunately, but the game does throw some interesting twists and turns your way through the course of the game to keep things interesting.\n\nThe enemies are also fairly varied. The main force being a selection of different types of Oozes, as mentioned earlier, but there's other types about, one returning BOW from the older series, and the game does a pretty good job at introducing new enemies up until the end of the game. There's also a few bosses, who work well for being intimidating, but also fun to fight.\n\nMusic is actually rather fantastic. Some excellent songs help the mood and keep the cold ocean feel and melodic charm going. There are several stand-out tracks, but the entirety of it is pretty good.\n\nAnd let me get this out of the way. It's an excellent PC port. The game shows its handheld nature in many ways, but the graphics have been updated substantially since its original 3DS release. Lots of options to customize, and it runs rather well. Honestly the only issue I've really had at all with the port is sometimes when in windowed mode if you click out a lot, the game will on the rare occasion crash, but its a very minor thing, both as its fairly rare and the game saves progression automatically quite regularly.\n\nThe only other thing to touch base on is Raid Mode, which is the replacement in this game to Mercenaries Mode. To best describe it would be to basically say imagine Mercenaries had a child with Monster Hunter, as in this mode you go through locations from the game (either alone, or with a co-op partner online) and hunt and kill monsters, get a ranking, and earn loot. Guns, mods, and the like. You can unlock a rather large variety of characters from the game, each who have their own unique skills (some better use certain weapons, some recover health over time, each has a different knifing style and melee attack, etc.), and a unique level. The level system is like an RPG, where you gain experience and gaining a level increases things like your defense and attack power. However, in a neat addition, you can select your level when selecting your character up to the point you've unlocked, so let's say I had a level 20 Jill but wanted to play with someone who was level 2, I could lower my level down to 2 to play with them a bit more fairly, and then raise it back up whenever I wanted, but not past the level I've unlocked, which is 20.\n\nRaid Mode is absolutely addicting, and probably what will keep you coming back to this title most if you take the delve into it. There's 21 levels, and each one gets longer, more extravagant, and as they go along, start throwing in things like multiple explorable areas and even boss monsters from the campaign. On-top of this, each level has four different difficulties, and these don't just make them harder, but change the layout of each where enemies spawn, where items are, and more. But you need to finish all the stages on one difficulty to unlock the next difficulty. That is, except the 21st level, which is kind of a bonus level that's only recommended if you're maxed out. The last level is a treat in itself that you have to work hard to tackle. It's basically the entire ship from the main game turned into an open-world, enemy-infested obstacle course, with multiple ending points, multiple paths through the ship, and lots of goodies to collect, including a hidden boss exclusive to this stage. It's a lot of fun and very challenging.\n\nRevelations may have a convoluted story, cheesy dialogue, key collecting, back-tracking, and interesting inhuman enemies... But it also feels more like a mash-up of new with the old, and not a true overall callback to the classic survival-horror of the series. But that doesn't mean it's a bad game, and completely worth your time if you either enjoy the series or enjoy these sort of action or horror type of games. It's a lot of fun, and has a good amount of replay value. It may not be the best in its series, but it's a fun, ridiculous ride while it lasts.","March 7, 2014","true","63.3"," 232 of 254 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","232","254","0","11"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mysterd/recommended/222480/","mysterd","MysterD "The Gaming Toaster"","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mysterd/","1429 products in account","CAMPAIGN REVIEW ONLY:\n\nResident Evil: Revelations (RE:R) is a spin-off from the numbered RE game, since numbered RE's have become more + more blockbuster-esque + action-esque. Revelations takes some steps to bring the RE series a bit closer to its survival-horror roots, which long-time fans of RE series are going to appreciate. Also, RE:R keeps some of the things that were found in RE5 (i.e. you will often have an AI companion with you + KB-mouse controls were drastically improved) + RE6 (the game will have you playing from different agents' perspective).\n\nWhile RE's plot is typical RE stuff, if you've played any of the previous RE's, it's still enjoyable, ridiculous, quite over-the-top + hammy. Agents from different organizations are involved in a pair or so of ships that have a Virus on them - and the agents are here to clean-up the mess. With twists + turns in the story + plot, never is there a dull moment, even despite the dialogue + writing never ever really taking-off, staying quite serviceable.\n\nRE:R delivers a much more solid gameplay experience than RE6, never feeling like you will be replaying the same exact levels + boss fights numerous times that you did on another campaign. RE6 had tons of major highs + some major lows, while RE:R never ever does that at all - from start-to-finish, RE:R is, for the most part, is excellent. Unlike RE5+6, expect to constantly run out of ammo and be switching weapons - often bringing back the survival-horror feel that had been dwindling since RE5. Controls feel very similar to RE5+6 PC, in terms of the actual controls - so, you're fine with how those controlled with the KB-mouse, expect more of that. For me, it was best to turn-off Mouse Acceleration in the Options - to make the mouse actually move more properly - otherwise, the mouse didn't control correctly.\n\nWhen assets + backtracking get re-used, it is done in a way where something is twisted into a different way entirely - which was one of the biggest problems with RE6. RE:R's biggest problem is actually in its graphics quality, since its environments really show that this was a port from a mobile platform - with often some blurry environments, bland environments & not-detailed areas showing up on-screen. On the other hand - characters + enemy models look really good, showing that those are of a much higher + better quality.\n\nThe game rarely dropped belong 60 frames per seconds on its highest settings, playing smoothly most of the time. There were a few stutters and framerate drops - which, oddly enough, were when going from area-to-area in one of the hubs, when nothing of much was happening, when waiting to move to the next area. When it mattered, during combat - most of the time, 60 frames per second on my PC (i7 950; 1 GB of GeForce GTX 560 Ti; 8 GB RAM; Win 7 64-bit).\n\nIf you found RE6 disappointing for whatever reasons - and certainly many did, while I found it to be a gem, despite its numerous flaws - make sure to check out RE:R. RE:R is a return to the greatness that came from RE4 + also takes some of the elements of RE5+6 that were worthwhile. Certainly, RE:R is an improvement over in RE6 in terms of overall consistentcy + brings back some of the survival-horror elements that were missing in a majority of RE6. After 16 hours of playing, RE:R proves that graphics ain't always everything, when the overall gameplay is consistently fantastic.\n\nFinal Grade = B+.\n\nADDITIONAL NOTES On RE Series -> RE4,5,6 + Rev:\nKeep in mind, I have yet to play RE1-3, believe it or not.\nRE4 PC (Non-HD Edition) might've been the greatest RE game that I've played so far, despite it being a not-so-good PC port (in terms of PC controls for the KB-mouse).\nRE5 was a really good game-experience + major improvement in making a great PC version for a RE game.\nRE6 is just a flawed-gem of a game.\nRE:R fits in as being the best actual RE game that I've played since actually RE4.","September 21, 2014","true","16.0"," 89 of 94 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","89","94","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jesskitten/recommended/222480/","jesskitten","Shiara","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jesskitten/","1888 products in account","Mmm. This was my first real foray into Resident Evil, and I liked it so much that I finished the entire game in one sitting that went way er, late into the morning.\n\nThough I have no other RE benchmark to compare it to, I thought the campaign story was really neat and well done, lots of twists that kept me guessing. Most of the characters had interesting personalities, though as a new player to the RE series with no prior background knowledge of the characters besides knowing they exist, I feel not much was done with Chris and Jill outside of them obviously being "the celebrity couple that won't admit it" in the game. I suppose you're meant to know them from previous games, but as a standalone, they ended up being the flattest characters even though you get to play the both of them and thus like them by virtue of them being an extension of "you".\n\nI enjoyed the episodic sort of storytelling technique with a cutscene recap of the previous episode at the start of each next one as though it was a TV serial. Ammo shortages put a constant pressure on the campaign (on normal) but it was not overly scarce, so generally it was a good balance. Definitely had to use every single gun in the game and swap them in and out at times though.\n\nI seldom play games with this kind of 3rd person angled camera, and I was afraid I'd get motion sickness at first, but as it thankfully turned out it was not an issue for me through the game. I didn't have issues aiming or shooting but did have slight issues locating the enemy at times, but by the end of the game had become accustomed enough to it.\n\nThe horror element in this game was mostly the gore/grotesque sort of horror, and not the kind of horror that keeps one awake at night from the sheer terror of a floorboard creaking in the kitchen.\n\nThere are only two, maybe three fights in the game that would really count as "bosses" with a particular strategy/way to defeat them or stay alive against, and not just giant meatbags. There were a couple fun little turret shooting sessions too.\n\nThe biggest negative, I would say, is that some quest objectives that were not marked on the map should have been. You are made to run back and forth to different parts of the ocean liner that most of the story takes place on, and the map is humongous and somewhat complex to comprehend. The story also jumps back and forth between the three pairs of characters and a fourth flashback pair, taking the player on and off the ship to different locations on a whim. Those together plus the nature of an episodic game encouraging people to take breaks between each chapter/episode, all leads to the fact that it's very easy to get lost in the ship and head in the entirely wrong direction. This can be especially bad since ammo does not respawn.\n\nThe campaign is entirely solo, the listed co-op tag is solely for Raid mode, which seems to be some sort of wave survival rubbish that I plan to never play. There is a New Game+ available after you finish the campaign, which is you keeping your characters + some extra unlocked gear and starting a new campaign with them. I probably will look toward other games in the series/franchise instead, though.","July 13, 2015","true","14.3"," 70 of 78 people (90%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","90","70","78","7","7"

Explore an abandoned ship, read memos of former events, examine corpses, solve puzzles along the way, but be ready to survive a relentless undead assault at any moment.\n\n+That music made my day: The soundtrack, (mostly consisted of zombie growls, victim screams and background music) being atmospheric and experimental, transforms RE:R into an unforgettable experience. Headphone use strongly recommended. The soundtrack on Youtube by Canal de Redblogij: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l850aJb0JY8&list=PLC3E70FFEF4BC3FD6\n\n+Cast of characters: The original duet (Jill Valentine-Chris Redfield) has returned for a new dance with the undead. At the same time, some of the newest cast entries are quite interesting (Parker, Cadet, Jessica, etc.) and would definitely benefit future RE titles with their appearance.\n\n+Enemies: Instead of your ordinary, slow, rotting zombies, RE:R features a wide array of enemies, each with its own strength and weaknesses. Since the title revolves around an aquatic environment, your opponents were designed accordingly. Their forms are some of the best the series has ever presented.\n\n+Chapter separation: RE:R is divided into chapters. Each chapter offers new challenges and gives the player the opportunity to control different characters. Before each new chapter a summary of the previous one is shown, thus preventing the players from forgetting what has happened, in case they decide to play the game sporadically.\n\n+Scanning system: “Genesis” is a unique equipment which scans your surroundings for hidden ammo, herbs and items. Also, scanning enemies has its benefits.\n\n+Inventory system:RE:R demands clever use of herbs (only 5 can be carried at a time), bullets and grenades. Inventory is at first limited but can be expanded by finding certain inventory parts or weapon mods. Such limitation not only rewards the conservative and clever combatants but enhances the feeling of survival horror throughout the game.\n\n+Raid mode: The highlight of the game and the main reason you will be spending hundreds of hours on RE:R. Similar to the infamous Mercenaries mode of previous RE titles, Raid presents a new challenge: Enemies with special abilities and different levels swarm various locations from the single player campaign and the player must kill them all or advance to the end of the stage. As if the ordinary Hunter weren't enough, how about facing a Hunter boss or a sneaky Hunter baby with increased attack rating and tiny frame? Don't forget to spend your Battle points in the store after each raid for new weapons, mods and unlockable characters. Raid also features online or local cooperation for whole family entertainment!\n\n+Difficulty levels: Three difficulty levels to master. Having played almost all RE titles, I can assure you that Revelations can be hard and punishing to reckless players (during boss fights, for instance). Completing the game on the hardest difficulty is a great achievement, especially for hardcore gamers.\n\n+Weapon customization: Scattered around the map are special modification parts which can be attached to your weapons. Searching for them adds to the exploration and motivates the player to search remote or dangerous areas. The combinations are limitless and you can always change equipped mods at the iconic storage boxes from previous RE games.\n\nWeaknesses\n-Voice acting: It was always an issue with RE titles but that doesn't mean it should be considered a tradition. Dear voice actors, show some enthusiasm during the recording sessions!\n\n-Finishing/melee moves feel coarse and restricting. The dodging mechanism, albeit crucial for the latest parts of the game, seems deferred and difficult to master.\n\n-Respect the elderly: RE:R aged somewhat badly. In all honesty, I didn't get the feeling Capcom paid any attention to graphically upgrading the PC port.\n\n-Downloadable content of minor (or cosmetic) value.\n\n-The not so legendary Chris Redfield: The single player campaign lacks the cooperation mode of RE 6 and the AI controlled companions are rather weak.\n\nNeutral ground\n±Comparison to Nintendo 3DS :Albeit close to its older brother, I found the online matching search in Raid mode cooperation faster than that of the 3DS version. Other than that, the two versions are almost identical.\n\nMy rating3/5 (Steam version) ~ 4/5 (Nintendo 3DS version)\nRevelations is one of the best modern Resident evil games. Its soundtrack is delightful and the Raid mode is positively addicting. Nevertheless, if you own it on Nintendo 3DS, skip the Steam version. If you insist on buying it, wait for a discount sale.","October 7, 2015","true","72.3"," 74 of 84 people (88%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","88","74","84","6","7"

However, this game from my personal experience was ported to the 3DS to PC with full mouse support. It is easier to kill zombies in this game and preform headshots with the mouse from my personal experience. The controls on mouse are fluid, not clunky and have ease of access. I have not touched raid mode yet so this review is primarily to discuss the features and quality of campaign mode.\n\nStory: The story really drew me in to now claim the Resident Evil series as my favorite horror series. *** Note *** This is the first Resident Evil game I have ever played in my life.   Yes, I know many people claim  the more recent Resident Evil  titles are action based. However, the balance between horror & action in this game is very well done. This game takes the whole series back to its roots of what Resident Evil is meant to be. As always with any of these types of games the higher the difficulty the more you have to conserve your ammo and survive. So then it becomes harder and a true test of survival on the hardest difficulty and will take quite a long time to master for those that are not naturals or niche in this specific genre.\n\nThe story takes place in the Mediterranean Sea across various ships you have to survive on where many people out of your crew go missing. You have to find those people throughout the whole course of the game as a part of what is called a counter bio-terrorism group which means those people that fight terrorist groups to help other survivors and end the infection when the head of the FBC gains hold of what is called the T-Abyss virus. Without going in too much detail this virus has spread a gas and transformed the continent known as terregregia. Your job is to play as Jill Valentine & Parker to find why characters have gone missing and find out more about the secret organization that has taking over Terregregia and is trying to spread the virus across the oceanside. You play as other character pairs too though I will not discuss those since that would spoil the game.\n\nLasting appeal: Great boss battles, a creepy and satisfying atmosphere. I love that it takes place on ships because it can be hard when others are missing and you have to rescue them for the sake of humanity and being the good guys to stop corruption.\n\nGraphics: Graphics are greatly improved from the 3DS version and you can tell. Crisp visuals, great effects of storms in the sea when you have scenes of you on a ship first arriving at the island. Great environments and voiceovers for some passengers that still speak in a human voice but have been corrupted by the virus that has changed them completley.\n\nPacing: Pacing is good throughout all the Twelve chapters. You can continue at whatever pace you want without the story line distracting away from the main other features of the game.\n\nMorale: Can you trust all survivors in this game or have some turned away from you and are part of a conspiracy of the organization you are defending to protect? Play this game and find out.\nOverall : 9/10.","February 5, 2015","true","135.7"," 58 of 65 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","58","65","2","3"

For those of you who never took RE seriously in the first place, there's a good old cheesy story here.\n\nThe fact that this is a 3DS port rarely, if ever, shows through - the loading between areas is an occasional reminder and can get a little annoying, but otherwise that's about it. Story-lenth wise, expect a full 10-12 hour campaign broken down into episodes.\n\nLastly, RE:Rev has what's called "Raid Mode" - which feels like a cross between a Time Trial and Mercenaries - it offers a surprisingly deep combat system and plenty of replay value beyond the campaign, so if you're the completionist type, expect at least half a dozen or more hours of gameplay on top of what you already have.\n\nIf you're an RE fan and you enjoyed RE:4 but understand the difference between RE0-3 and RE4, know very well that this is far closer to 4 than any of the others. Even then, it isn't without its challenges and I wholeheartedly recommend you give it a try anyways.","November 12, 2014","true","41.7"," 46 of 48 people (96%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","96","46","48","3","2"

A little over a year later, Capcom decided to release it on the consoles and PC.\n\nStory\nSet between Resident Evil 4 and 5, this game will have you playing as Jill Valentine, as she and her partner are sent to discover the source of creatures that have been washing up on shore. They soon discover a cruise ship filled with dead people and various monsters. Their day goes down hill from there.\n\nPresentation\nWhile not as pretty as Resident Evil 6, the visuals in this game are quite nice, and its easy to forget that this was original made for a screen only a few inches big. Some textures are a little blurry. Character models for both you and enemies look great though.\n\nThe voice acting in this game works well, with there never being any problem understanding what characters are saying. No faults here. Music works well to set the mood of the locations, adding to the atmosphere. The sound effects are also great, with plenty of small things to enhance the scares.\n\nControls\nYou won't have any problems with controls, no matter if you prefer a gamepad like me or a keyboard and mouse. Both work well, using the standard controls for a third person shooter.\n\nGameplay\nWell the controls may have shifted to the standard for a third person shooter, you don't need to worry that this is all action and explosions like Resident Evil 6 was so fond of. This game frequently has you searching for just a bit more ammo and dodging monsters rather than destroying them. It even has some of the old fetch quest puzzles to keep you busy. You are simply able to move around better while dealing with the swarms of foes. The shambling monstrosities can still get in your way often enough, but its easy enough to take them down. Just don't forget to keep an eye on your ammo, and the other on your surroundings, as there are always more beasts looking to take you down. Many of the fights will involve numerous creatures looking to nibble on you.\n\nThis game has streamlined the inventory. Now, you can hold at most three weapons and some grenades, several green herbs, and any key items as you find. The only time you will need the storage box is to switch between various weapons and upgrade them. These are one of the new changes, where you can find various parts to try out on your gear. Some will boost damage, others increase clip size or reload speed, and others will be able to boost other stats or add additional abilities to your favourite weapons.\n\nThe last major addition to this game that should be mentioned is the Genesis. This device allows you to scan your surroundings and the enemies you come across. Enemies will boost the Genesis scan percentage, with it giving you an additional herbs, which scanning the landscape will reveal hidden items such as ammo or weapon parts.\n\nThis game is incredible fun, but being a Resident Evil title, and one made for a handheld to boot, the game can be finished rather quickly if you are focused on just beating the story mode. My own playtime for the story was just over 6 hours.\n\nLifespan\nFortunately, there is no reason you have to stop there. If playing the story over in New Game Plus mode while on a higher difficulty isn't enough to tempt you, perhaps the Raid mode will. This is a series of levels based on the story mode, where you will need to reach the end of each level while taking down the enemies in your way, either while playing solo or with a friend online. As you go through each area and accomplish goals, you will earn additional weapons, weapon parts, costumes and experience. Your character will be able to level up and become more powerful, which will be wanted for the later Raid levels.\n\nClosing\nThis is, in my opinion, one of the best Resident Evil titles available, and easily the best released in the last 8 years. Good story, great gameplay and an extra mode for you and a friend to continue enjoying well after you have tired of beating the main mode.","October 31, 2013","true","19.2"," 95 of 131 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","95","131","0","0"

I think this is because the game actually quite feels a lot like the old RE games, and it truly feels like a survival horror. But the game still focuses a lot on action as well. I thought the game story and the graphics were rather, underwhelming, but I guess I can not really blame them as this game basically started out as a Nintendo 3DS game.\n\nThe game actually feels like you are watching something like 24, kind of like a TV series that you would see on TV. And I thought that was an interesting idea.\n\nThe gameplay overall is quite well balanced, it is something more like a mix of Resident Evil 3 + Resident Evil 4, with better control overall.\n\nI mean, the game is really good. But, it just does not exactly "stand out" as you'd expect it to be. Maybe Resident Evil: Raccoon City is a bit more fancier graphically, but then again, since it started out as an N3DS game, I can not complain.\n\nAnd if anything, I thought the final boss was ridiculously hard for no reason. I have a feeling that I do not have good weapons against him, but then again, I don't think I can go back and find the weapons.....the creators should've learned from Resident Evil 5.\n\nOverall, nothing much to say. Not bad, not that amazing, either. Still quite enjoyable though.\n\n7.1/10","February 4, 2014","true","14.1"," 54 of 69 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","54","69","0","3"

And unlike many people who writes these reviews, I have the game beaten. The game is fun if you are looking for action topped off with some horror elements. What I will say is that this game is far from survival horror. Basically, this game is a spirtual sucessor to Resident Evil 4 as far as gameplay; however, the game has more survival horror elements than Resident Evil 4 but it has a long way to go before it goes back to the roots. Now on to the game itself.\n\nThe game basically takes place between Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil 5 (prologue as well) making it in movie terms a interquel (a story that is set between the original and the sequel). As far as the story goes, the plot is basically revolved around Jill Valentine and her new partner Paker investigating a ship named the Queen's Zinoba (sorry if I spelled it wrong). There are many twists and turns through out the story so, I won't say any more.\n\nOn to the gameplay, I think the gameplay is smooth and responsive at 60 fps. The only issue I have is the game forcing you to have a partner 95% of the time. I know back during the Resident Evil trilogy that you had AI partners but I feel like getting rid of AI partners for the most part would make the game have more tension. Also, I didn't like the fact that there was a whole lot of ammo to be found. But the worst part is the scanner. I think this is a device for causals would can't seem to find items.\n\nOverall, the game is a fun time for people who likes action with some survival horror elements mixed in. The old hardcore Resident Evil fans who want a game like the Resident Evil trilogy will not find what you are looking for here. So, let me summarize again. This game is a must buy for action fans while this game is a skip for surivival horror fans that want a challenge.","October 16, 2014","true","11.6"," 41 of 49 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","41","49","3","0"

At times the wonderful blue tones the game can give even make you think of RE1.5.\n\nIts as though the team knew they would ignore some of the nasty turns the series took since the fourth installment and deliver something more true to the spirit of the original titles.\n\nThe biggest bonus for me is, having grown up always playing the import versions of the first titles before they came out here, you can play it in glorious original japanese dub and text!

It brings back horror, and some action, just like the first installments. Sure, it's a port of the 3DS version but a very playable (and upgraded) one at that.\n\nThe graphics aren't realistic, but I thought they were very well done and I like the way everything looked. The atmosphere was definitely good. The voice acting is also surprisingly good and not too cheesy.\n\nYou'll be switching between several characters during the game which keeps things interesting, but the best parts are still the ones that play out on the big ship. You have a special camera that allows you analyze enemies and once the analysis reaches 100% you'll get a free health item. You can keep doing this but once you've captured the same enemy multiple times its progress will slow down. It's a very interesting game mechanic; do you risk getting attacked to analyze that one certain enemy, or do you just kill it and see if you can do it afterwards (which isn't always possible, because enemies disappear just seconds after being defeated).\n\nRER is a lenghty game, even though most of the other RE games take longer to complete. I finished this one in 10 hours, which is the ideal length if you ask me.\n\nIn other words; thumbs up for this Resident Evil !\n\n[Rating: 86/100]","February 3, 2014","true","16.3"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","26","30","0","1"

Resident Evil Revelations takes place in between the events of RE4 and RE5.Familiar faces Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine will be in the story plus new characters such as the charming Italian male named Parker,the flirtatious Jessica,specialist operatives named Keith and Quint whom are military style units and Quint is a specialist with tech stuff,commander O Brian who works for the organization named BSAA that Chris and Jill helped create to stop bioterrorists and the red-haired Raymond who is an agent from another organisation who has a mysterious aura to him and you aren't sure to trust him or not\n\nThe story shows the events that happened to a once beautiful city named Terragrigia which was built on an artificial island (you'll see how it's surrounded by beautiful ocean scenery) and the city was high tech,used clean energy but a series of disasters happened to the city .The story takes you to before and after Terragrigia was destroyed.All I will say is a bioterrorist organisation named II Veltro whom are against government control come into the story and the BSAA are a group whom were created specifically to combat bioterrorism and the group was founded with the help of known RE characters Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine.Jill and her partner Parker go on an infiltration style mission to spy on or stop II Veltro but they go missing and Chris and his partner Jessica go searching for Jill and Parker and you'll also control Keith and Quint.The individuals in the pairing of characters can change too.I like how the story shifts it's focus on different pairs of characters because it makes the story feel more thrilling by making you wonder will they be able to find eachother or not or will they survive\n\nThe story does a good job to fill you in one what happened to Terragrigia and explains about Terragrigia in detail with some beautiful cinematics and it makes an attempt to fill you in on story elements that happened in past RE games\n\nThe story also has a bit of character flirting and romantic interests mixed with a lot of seriousness and personally I like how the story is that way because the story is still disturbing and very serious and can be emotional but the romantic interest/flirting stuff and humor give the characters/story a nice break from some of the intensity at times\n\nThe gameplay in RE Rev is a great mix of classic survival horror and action gameplay.For much of the game you'll need to be conservative with ammo because ammo isn't plentiful like it is in RE4/RE5/RE6 which means you'll need to make headshots or cannot miss too often when you shoot(this adds more intensity to the gameplay as you'll try to make your last few remaining bullets count and was something that was missing in RE4/RE5/RE6.\n\nOverall: Probably the best original release title so far and it brings back the survival horror elements that classic style RE fans miss but uses the mechanics introduced in RE4 very well. so Add the creepy atmosphere,great graphics/beautiful cinematics and story/characters and you might care about make this game great/Superb","May 23, 2013","true","62.4"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","20","21","0","2"

You get to play as multiple characters throught the game, although they mostly play the same. The story not too deep, yet difficult to understand at times (might be easier for people familiar with other Resi games), but the ending is fairly satisfying, even though it leaves an obvious lead-in for the Revelations 2. There are many returning characters from older RESI games, but there are some interesting new ones, too.\n\nThe game itself is rather a shooter than an actual (survival) horror and I doesn't contain usuall Resi-type zombies, but rather strange sea-animal hybrids. Most of the bosses lack charisma and boss fights generally are heavily based around finding a tactic and using it over and over again. The scenery lacks variety at times (a major part of the story takes place on a ship), but brings something new to the Resi series on the other hand.\n\nThere are multiple minigames / sub-mechanics to bring some variety into the gameplay. I'll mention scanning for fingerprints and hidden items, hacking mini-game, arcade-style railway shooter, weapon upgrades and augmentations. There ARE quick-time events in this game, but they're not too frequent or annoying in any way. The controls overall work faily well on PC with Mouse & Keyboard.\n\nAs far as I know, there is no co-op mode for the campaign, but there is a Raid Mode for multiplayer, with unlockable equipment and skillpoints.\n\nAfter finishing the campaign, I can say I enjoyed the game, even though I've hated it at some points and wanted it to end already.

Yeah this ain't some artsy title with 90% emotional impact (and 10% QTEs) but it was certainly a challenge for me. If I had reviewed this game last year, last month or even last week I would have wrote "This game is not what I was looking for in a Resident Evil title, I hate it." But now I like RE:REV? Did the check from Capcom just arrive? Did mobsters threaten to break my kneecaps? No, I simply spent more time with the game.\n\nThe plot is something you'd expect out of a Resident Evil game. There's a bio-terrorist organization, an enigmatic villain, Jill in a wetsuit*, and the answers will leave fans scratching their collective heads. It's alright because we wouldn't have it any other way. RE:REV is divided into two modes, Campaign & Raid. Raid is where you'll spend most of your game-time, but you gotta play through the Campaign first to unlock all of it.\n\nSo for now let's explore the campaign. You spend about 80% of your mutant-blasting adventure on a ship. Most of the monsters are aquatic-themed, sometimes swimming is involved and...Oh No. RE:REV is nearly the equivalent of an over-long underwater stage. I hate underwater stages. There are floppy mutant fishes, a blue whale with tentacle-beasts(?), and even creatures you can't actually kill if you bump into them while swimming. There are also humanoids to contend with, and they're just...blech. They're simply gigantic bullet-sponges that aren't any fun to shoot.\n\nYour partner in RE:REV is the most baffling decision in the campaign. Since RE5, partners have become a common game-design element in the series, I don't mind them. With this game however I find myself asking...Why? Unlike previous games, your partner can't do any damage. He'll shoot at the creatures, maybe even punch them, but he won't register any kills. At least they're invulnerable, but the monsters know that, because they're usually focused on you. This must have been a last-minute change by Capcom. They might have planned for the entire campaign to have online co-op, but it fell through. Actually that doesn't make any sense, because it'd make the campaign much easier having two people to kill monsters instead of just one. Why didn't they just write "Partner AI does damage=1" in their little RE config.ini file?\n\nThe biggest "Why?" for me is...Why even have a partner at all? Most of the campaign takes place on a ship. The Queen Zenobia consists of cramped corridors, tiny rooms, and a couple set-piece locations. It's big enough to house a few soldiers and a ton of monsters, and not much else. It's natural to assume that Jill wouldn't go it alone, but how about we take Parker and...put him on the other side of the ship. He's not really affecting how the game is played, but he's still next to you, providing some sort of psychological "buff". Why don't we stick him somewhere else so that the game becomes scarier?\n\nOh and the less said about the Genesis scanner, the better.\n\nAll that said, RE:REV's campaign is still very solid. Unlike the more recent titles, it's better to avoid combat when you can. The creatures of the ship forgot how to open doors, so sometimes you should avoid them and move on. The infernal difficulty drills this idea into your head, as it removes the kid-gloves and throws tougher encounters at you from the beginning. I also enjoy finding parts and customizing guns. Wiping enemies out with the charging shot from a sniper rifle can be really satisfying.\n\nThe Raid Mode is, as I said, where you'll spend the bulk of your game-time. It's comprised of 61 stages across three difficulties. There's more RPG elements at play here, since you have to level-up to unlock and use better equipment. This mode also has online co-op, so I get to play as the useless partner from the campaign. Unfortunately the player-base for this game is miniscule, but the players you run into are friendly and will help (carry) you through the Raids. In any case it's a very well-done mode. Originally I hated it; I thought that I might as well play Borderlands if I wanted to shoot stuff and look at numbers. With enough time, everything clicks.\n\nLike Capcom's popular Monster-hunting game (I forgot the name of it), winning a stage in Raid mode isn't just about staying alive, it's also about preparation. Having the right weapons, with the proper customizations, and a healthy set of grenades, will get you much further than reflexes alone. Replaying stages isn't only a necessity for gaining experience, this familiarity can eventually be crafted into mastery. Once you have the layout down, you can shoot through these stages in record time, which can be really entertaining. As far as RE side-games go I'm still a Mercenaries man, but I appreciate what Capcom went for here. For the most part, I'd say they succeeded. Although I wish the exp. gains were higher. Right now I'm grinding stage 2 on the chasm difficulty and..ehhh...It's starting to get old. Not Raid mode, just...that stage..and the blobs...yeesh.\n\nWith a game like Resident Evil: Revalations, you can't expect to appreciate it in less than five hours. This game has some modern-era sensibilities that clash with its attempts at providing a more traditional RE experience. As a fan of RE4-6 I was taken aback by the differences in combat mechanics, and I'm still struggling with them (dodging in particular). Plus it's hard to ignore the fact that it's an up-port from the 3DS game. It looks better and runs at a constant 60 fps, but its environments and design-decisions due to the limited handheld are carried over. Still, I figure once you start creeping past the 10 hour mark you'll start liking this game, possibly even loving it.\n\n*Every other review mentioned Jill and/or her outfit. Just keeping up with the Joneses.","March 26, 2015","true","19.7"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","17","18","3","1"

It is fun for a while, but it quickly turns into a grind for XP and new items.\nThe facial animations are a little stiff, and overall the visuals naturally are not as nice as Resident Evil 5 or 6.\nIn my opinion is Revelations the best Resident Evil game of the past few years and the one that is the most true return to classic-style horror action.\nResident Evil: Revelations is very much worth playing in its HD form for its atmosphere and scares alone.\n\nSounds 9/10\nGraphics 7/10\nGameplay 8/10\nAtmosphere 9/10\n\nIf you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curation","August 28, 2013","true","62.4"," 35 of 51 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","35","51","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DiceeciD/recommended/222480/","DiceeciD","Never Let It End","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DiceeciD/","173 products in account","Resident Evil Revelations\nRevelations of a new future for a ruined franchise\n\nFor the last few years this series has been in a rut, the influence of the Triple A Industry has been ripping apart what made this series iconic in exchange for a steroid induced protagonist and the Hollywood makeover. Resident Evil Revelations isn’t this though, it’s a shining example of how you can have your cake and eat it, and with a little polish, this game could lead the franchise into a bright future.\n\nResident Evil Revelations starts off like most other Resi games, you even get the classic “Resident Evil” Voice line when you press start but compared to what we’ve been used to in the last few years, Revelations is a breath of fresh air. The Main setting of this game is the Queen Zenobia, a Cruise Liner stranded out in the Mediterranean Sea. You’ll start off as Jill Valentine with a new partner Parker Luciani, who acts as the bridge for the flashbacks in the story.\n\nAlthough this is not the only place you will see. Revelations takes you across different environments and settings and slowly reveals its story in a variety of interesting ways. Unfortunately the variance of environments and layout of the chapters can take you out of the setting. One moment you’ll be in a tense situation that needs to be resolved and then you’ll flash to other characters in a different environment doing things seemingly unrelated. The Cohesion between these scenes isn’t lost however they could be better arranged. Taking players out of a tense and important moment to shove plot down their throats is a sure fire way to take people out of the game.\n\nThe game’s major strengths are purely in the game play and the scare factor that’s been retained. It’s definitely not a Resi 4 and it doesn’t ring in the same vein as the classics, but Revelations has its moments. It never resorts to using pop scares and it rarely seems to by trying too hard to scare you instead relying on the classic formula of pacing and fear. The execution is successful but isn’t spectacular, due to the developers mixed directions. We’re talking about a game struggling to choose between its survival horror mum and 3rd person shooter dad, both wanting the Childs custody in the estranged divorce.\n\nThe Queen Zenobia excels in providing the best survival horror experience of all the settings, while other characters generally get way too much ammunition, powerful guns, and settings that don’t really incite any fear into the player. The experience on the Queen Zenobia isn't perfect and certainly doesn't give you the same kind of chills that most other Survival Horror classics do, but it certainly puts most of the more recent Resident Evil titles to shame.\n\nSome tropes that were established by previous games in the series make their return, and help provide some of the actually scary and powerful moments of the game. The plot while weak has its moments and is interesting enough to act as the bait that forces you through the scary moments, although the twists are predictable.\n\nMy major complaints come from some of the controls and the port quality. The Port Quality, before we cause any arguments here, is great. A lot of support for PC and for the main platforms that helps the game stand toe-to-toe with others, but the almost full price is a heavy deterrent considering how some of the games assets are taken into account. The Textures still remain at a quality level of that on a portable title which makes the game appear in parts like you're walking through a level on a PS2 game. This is fine for the fact the game is ported from a portable device, but the almost full price for a portable game on a PC/Console is a little excessive.\n\nThe Controls are an entirely different issue and the main gripe is the terribly designed dodge mechanic. It's unclear, un-intuitive, and one of the bosses actually depends on you using it, which is very hard when you can only ever get it to trigger by luck, and not by purpose. The B Button (Xbox360 Controller) could've been used in combat as a binary dodge button that would've worked a lot more effectively than the current system, which I can't even tell you because I don't fully understand how it works even after playing the game for 30+ hours. It's a problem but it doesn't ruin the experience, it just means you'll probably be chugging down more herbs than you should as a result of your inability to reliably dodge enemies.\n\nSome main aspects of the story also create some issues that can make the game seem out of place in the franchise. Revelations tries to insert some interesting plot into the gap between Resident Evil 4 and 5, but it seems unfitting. Some aspects like the city of Terragrigia don’t fit in with the time setting or the theme of the game. Every time I see the city it feels awkward to think this place is now a part of the Resident Evil Universe especially considering the conceived time it was supposedly erected in the world.\n\nThe soundtrack of the game can be pretty forgettable. When thinking about what music or sounds there were that stuck out to me, I can only really think of one or two exceptions, the rest just slip from memory as barely noticeable ambience. Not to say the sound design is horrible, it's just not amazing either. It's ok, so-so, mediocre, acceptable.\n\nSome other notable mentions can include the side characters, Quint and Keith, who only really act as a comedy act that isn't very fun or very fun to play at all. Overall I would've preferred some more time with the main story instead of the two incapable BSAA agents. Enemy variety is also a bit missing. The only variety in the normal enemies generally comes from a shooter type that is quite annoying to deal with, and every now and then you might encounter an enemy with big claws, but it's generally pretty thin when you're not encountering any of the special enemies (B.O.Ws) but you won't really be dealing with enough of these enemies to warrant a large complaint.\n\nRevelations also comes with a small gimmick that takes up an entire controller button called the scanner, which is mainly used to deliver plot to you in an arbitrary manner and help you farm herbs from the enemies so you can deal with your broken dodge mechanic. It's implemented ok, but the lack of any real reason to use it without being forced questions the decision to put such a device in.\n\nOne thing that really redeems this game out of a lot of its faults is Raid Mode. Raid Mode is a Single Player/Co-op mode where you will navigate different levels killing enemies in a more RPG style manner akin to borderlands or monster hunter. You'll get drops from the enemies and weapons that you can upgrade to take on the tougher levels and unlock new characters. The experience is quite addicting and playing it with friends can be fun, although one or two minor glitches can result that can cause some issues, like getting stuck behind a safe door or enemies sometimes desynchronizing from each other's matches which will result in confusion and most likely an unfair death. These bugs rarely occur though and the overall experience is really fun, but if you want to get the best out of it, I would suggest buying the game on a 3DS, as the time wasting abilities of this mode are good when you're on the go and have nothing to do.\n\nRevelations fills a good hole for those who are unable to find a decent resident evil game to suit their tastes. It's not the survival horror game that you want, but it comes pretty close and scratches that itch pretty well.\n\nBuy it, but if you're patient, wait for a sale. I wouldn't pay over £25-$40 for this game, but it's worth every cent up to that point.\n","November 27, 2013","true","37.0"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

Played through it on 3DS and absolutely loved it enough to get the PC port. The control scheme and layout is very comfy, a nice mix of Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil 6, without the annoying amount of QTEs. Those are thankfully absent here, besides a melee counter, and wiggle-to-free-yourself action.\n\nThe graphics are very smooth and pleasing to look at, improved over its 3DS predecessor. Things like characters mouths not moving when speaking are nonexistant here, and the narmy voice acting is preserved. Little things remain however, like fps drop whenever you're moving from the grand hall to other locations, but that is probably the only time.\n\nThe atmosphere and music is also a big step up from the newer Resident Evil titles. The dank, gooey, bloody tight halls and rooms of the Queen Zenobia are claustrophobic and the enemy design is unnerving at times (all about that first Scagdead). The ship is oppressive and very reminiscent of older Resident Evil locales, especially the Remake. Music is much more noticeable and a lot of themes stand out very well, especially the Main Hall and the final boss theme.\n\nHowever, the atmosphere and writing is where things get hit-or-miss. While the ship has fantastic atmosphere, the story itself jumps around to three pairs of characters, and as such the story is told in a linear fashion, with facts coming in from three different subplots, but the change in characters and locations can jar the mood and atmosphere a lot. Your mileage may definitely vary with the nonregular characters and their designs and voices.\n\nAnother point of contention is the dodge mechanic, returned from Resident Evil 3, here implemented as a wonky directional press depending on certain timing, with no onscreen prompt. It won't be a problem if you play with a controller, as you can jiggle back and forth and pretty much nail it, but on keyboard and mouse, you'll be in for trouble.\n\nAnother misstep that sullies the gameplay is the near constant presence of a partner character, that takes away a distinct amount of tension. It seems co-op was probably not added in time or something, because you'll almost always have an AI partner with you to chat with, which is a shame. The few times you go without, you will notice distinctly more tension, and the game could have benefited very much from drop-in/drop-out co-op similar to Dead Space 3's version of it.\n\nThe enemies as well are very interesting, and have a neat and unique backdrop for their creation, but sadly do not have a lot of creativity. You will see a lot of the same 3 or 4 in waves later in the game, which gets repetitive. Even the return of the classic Resident Evil beasty the Hunters (including an invisible variant!), is somewhat neutered here, being easily killed, and due to the scrubbing of gore in the creation of the game, has their legendary leap-decap turned into an offscreen affair (and there are PLENTY of interesting seeming deaths that are way too clean for what they are).\nHowever, a recurring eerie mutant, and the final boss give a welcome boost of nostalgia and challenge.\n\nThe game isn't perfect by far, but it is definitely a step in the right direction to being an enjoyable Resident Evil title, and I wholeheartedly recommend it. Even when you're done with the main story, Raid Mode can addict you to it very very easily, with just killing monsters, loads of weapons, as well as monster mutations, and playing co-op multiplayer with it can add even more.","November 22, 2014","true","4.3"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","0"

The very first Resident Evil on the PlayStation 1 was nothing less than, well, a "revelation" to me when I first discovered it.  Having spent years prior basically disinterested in video games in favour of more "respectable" art/entertainment forms such as films, a funny thing happened on the way to the grave and I found myself no longer very "scared" by horror movies any more...a shame, since it has arguably been my single favourite of all genres since, well, at least my mid-teens or so.  Then I discovered that it was possible for a VIDEO GAME to have much the same effect, only perhaps more so...for in spite of the questionable graphics and clunky movement, it was officially now ME essaying the role of the lead protagonist in a horror story.  And that was a very scary proposition indeed!  The first time I discovered that giant shark in the mansion's basement...man, that was an epic moment...and the Resident Evil series was of course destined to become all the MORE epic, in time.  Though not necessarily in a GOOD way...\n\nResident Evil 2 took things to a SLIGHTLY more action-packed and, yes, "epic" level, but still managed to unquestionably maintain the horror credentials of its predecessor.  Resident Evil 3...well, it was still mostly favouring the fear over the fight, but with the first advent of a firearm-wielding monster, things were starting to veer just the teensiest, tiniest bit downhill.  Code Veronica thankfully steered things back toward a more staunchly horror-orientated direction shortly thereafter...but then of course came Resident Evil 4 (let's just ignore the Survivor/Dead Aim/Outbreak/etc games for the purposes of this review, since they honestly don't exist in the minds of most RE fans).  Yes, just when all seemed lost if the series were to indeed continue in the direction it was mostly heading in, RE4 managed to reinvigorate the waning faith of many a fan, not so much by taking the series in a less action-y direction, but by downright REINVENTING the gameplay in a way which better SUITED the increased amount of enemies and firepower and what-have-you.  And it managed to do so without compromising that all-important "horror factor" TOO much.\n\nWhich brings us to Resident Evil 5...sigh.  I mean, it wasn't that bad...at least until the utterly ridiculous rock-punching (!) climax set in a volcanic landscape, at which point those little hints of manga and anime which the series had harboured for so long took true hold and ♥♥♥♥ all over anything even vaguely resembling logic or atmosphere.  Its myriad sins seem pale in comparison, however, to part 6, which - from as much as I have been able to bear to play of it so far - appears to be a final declaration that the games which helped spawn a series of by-and-largely moronic MIlla Jovavich action movies were now SUBSERVIENT to said movie series, and it was officially a "horror" series no more.  Thankfully, however, the good people at Capcom saw fit shortly BEFORE this atrocity to give birth to a side-series which would better retain the "survival horror" flavour of the early games...\n\nResident Evil Revelations, please step forward for evaluation.\n\nIt's been described as "Resident Evil 4.5", and it can certainly lay claim to that title story-wise.  So what about...GAMEPLAY-wise?  Well...pretty much, yeah.  I'll admit I wasn't too impressed early on, finding myself essentially confused by all the episodic jumping back and forth between different characters in different places and what-not...which only served, incidentally, to compromise one of the single most important contributing factors to the tension generated in a successful "survival horror" game, namely that of ammo and/or healing conservation (that is to say, when you only have to make what few items you possess last until the end of one or two chapters, a good deal of this tension inevitably abates).  BUT...after a while the focus falls at least predominantly on the characters trapped out at sea, and it's in these segments that Revelations manages to capture some of that old-school "isolation horror" charm.\n\nTo some degree it's almost like the RE1 mansion set on a boat (well, three boats, but who's counting), with a bit of Tomb Raider-inspired swimming and butt-centric visuals - this is still aimed at young males, after all - to fill it all out.  But mostly, I gotta say...it's pretty good.  Not a TOTAL return to form - the AI is certainly about as ♥♥♥♥ as such things can get, including one bit where monsters were literally either walking or jumping straight past not ONE but TWO NPCs to get to my player-controlled character! - but it's about the best we can hope for for now, one suspects.  Though Revelations 2, horror of horrors, actually looks like a ♥♥♥♥ing SILENT HILL game in the screenshots!  So maybe there really is hope for this franchise after all.  It's pretty much like the film industry these days:  When in doubt, REBOOT.  It worked for the Batman movies, and it can work for the Resident Evil games.  We'll just have to wait and see, though, won't we?\n\nVerdict: 9/10.\n\n(And speaking of Batman...you know that a video game series has been going on just a LITTLE TOO LONG when an otherwise perfectly straight "rookie government agent" character is designed with hair which makes him look like THE JOKER.  What, Leon's hair in RE4 wasn't over-stylish or impractical ENOUGH for you people?!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brotmeister/recommended/222480/","Brotmeister","Hans Brotmeister","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brotmeister/","352 products in account","Resident Evil Revelations is a third-person survival horror game. To many this may come as a surprise because Resident Evil 5 and 6 pretty much abandoned the survival horror aspect of the series. Revelations though takes inspirations from the newer titles while staying a true Resident Evil game at its core.\n\nFor the most part of the game you are playing as Jill Valentine who is accompanied by her new partner Parker. However, for a majority of the game the action alternates between three teams: Jill Valentine and Parker Luciani, Chris Redfield and Jessica Sherawat as well as Keith “Grinder” Lumley and Quint Cetcham who are basically Cool Guy and Comic Relief Guy. This might sound as if I would not like the characters but they are actually pretty enjoyable.\n\nThe plot takes place between Resident Evil 5 & 6. One year before the futuristic floating city of Terragrigia had been attacked by the terrorist organization Il Veltro. Veltro had released the new T-Abyss Virus as well as several packs of hunters, ultimately leading to the FBC using Terragrigria’s solar energy satellite to completely destroy the city in order to stop the spread of the virus. After the Terragrigia incident Veltro had completely vanished.\n\nJill and Parker learn that Chris went missing during an investigation and set out to rescue him. Chris’ signal has been lost somewhere over the Mediterranean, not too far from the ruins of Terragrigia. Jill and Parker find the cruise ship Queen Zenobia that had been used by Veltro during the attack on Terragrigia and had not been seen since.\n\nResident Evil is played in a third-person shoulder perspective like most entries in the series since Resident Evil 4. The camera is zoomed out a bit more though. The controls are slightly different from RE 4 and 5. You are able to strafe and to shoot while walking. Generally the player movement feels a tad faster than in previous Resident Evil games. Some of the enemies are pretty fast too.  Resident Evil Revelations also re-introduces the dodge move from RE 3. You can dodge pretty much anything if you time it right. Depending on the enemy it can be quite hard but it is always removing when you dodge successfully.\n\nThe inventory system is streamlined compared to previous games. You have three weapon slots and can carry up to five herbs as well a fixed number of every type of grenades. It is a strange choice to remove every form of inventory management from a Resident Evil game and I have to say that I probably liked the way it was handled in RE 4 best. While the inventory system in Revelations is clearly not my favorite it does not hurt the game much.\n\nWeapons can be swapped and upgraded at boxes that are found on the Queen Zenobia. There are a lot of weapons to find or unlock. Most of them are not flat out better or worse than other. They all have their upsides and downsides. The upgrading system works differently from the previous games. Instead of spending money to apply fixed upgrades to your weapon you can find weapon attachments, most of which can be applied to any weapon. Every weapon has a certain number of upgrade slots. Upgrades can be switched or removed at the same boxes where you can swap your weapons. The system works pretty well but there is one thing I do not like about it. Personally I like to have all my weapons upgraded and ready for use. However since you will not have enough upgrade kits to put in every weapon you would like to use you will – at least in the beginning – be forced to swap upgrades when changing weapons, which is an unfortunate interruption to the gameplay.\n\nA completely new addition to the series is the Genesis. The Genesis is a scanner that is able to find hidden objects and enemies. While you are using the Genesis the game changes to a first person perspective. You can still move slowly but you cannot fight while using the device. Frequent use of the Genesis is highly recommended since you can find loads of ammo, upgrade kits and healing items with it.\n\nThe thing I like most about Resident Evil Revelations is that it nails the atmosphere. While there are some changes to the Resident Evil formula Revelation has everything a good RE title needs: claustrophobic environments, hilarious puzzles and scary enemies. The plot is told in the style of a TV show and there are frequent recaps, which works fairly well. It reminded me of Alan Wake to a certain degree. The story has a lot of twists and while I think that the developers overdid it at times some of the twists were executed beautifully. Especially the “Semiramis” twist left my staring at the screen with my mouth open.\n\nThe thing I like least about Revelations is how the developers handled the AI partners. The damage they deal is unbelievably low. Here is an example: At a point where I was able to kill basic enemies with two close range shotgun hits I shot an enemy once. After that my partner shot the same enemy four of five times. With a shotgun. At close range. However, the enemy still was not dead. That is how low the AI damage is. You should never trust the AI to handle anything on their own. Their damage is just sad and most of the time they cannot even tank because enemies mostly ignore them. At least the AI partners cannot die, so that is a plus.\n\nAside from the campaign Resident Evil Revelations also offers Raid Mode which basically is the Resident Evil version of a dungeon grinder. There is a bunch of characters to choose from, all with their respective strengths. You can then choose a stage that is heavily inspired by a part of the single-player campaign. Your mission is always to get to the end and if possible kill all enemies. On your way you level up and get items drops that can either be weapons or upgrade kits. There is a surprisingly high amount of content here. It is also possible to play Raid mode in online-co-op.\n\nWhile I have some minor complaints about Resident Evil Revelations I think that it is a really good game. It tries out new stuff without abandoning what makes Resident Evil… well…  Resident Evil. I highly recommend it to veterans and newcomers alike.\n\nMore reviews here","November 14, 2015","true","36.7"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dfactor/recommended/222480/","dfactor","Dfactor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dfactor/","1000 products in account","Resident Evil Revelations or like I call it - "REv" is game ported from 3DS. It's an attempt to "go back to the roots" and quite successful too. It takes place between RE4 and RE5 at the times when BSAA was just recently formed. You're stuck on almost ghost-like ship fighting for your survival. The game offers actual moments of horror, eerie atmosphere, various ship locations, wacky story... all this makes the game closer to oldschool REs.\n\nI'll list all pros and cons I can think of (alphabetical order).\nPros:\n-AI. Sometimes you'll have a partner with you. They're quite independent and won't ruin your game (*cough* RE5,6 *cough).\n-Characters. Jill and Chris are back and there are completely new characters as well.\n-Customizable weapons. You can add special attachments to your guns. They will alter/change your gun behavior.\n-Enemies. Ooze enemies can give you the chills. They look and move weird (Regenerator/Iron Maiden style), there are plenty of variations of them. Also Hunters. Yes, the hunters are back.\n-Inventory. You can carry 3 weapons at a time and do not have to worry about any item slots at all. There are ammo limits, but the inventory is made is simple as possible.\n-Raid Mode. It's a really big part of a game. Can be compared to The Mercenaries. The goal is to simply survive while moving through few areas of the ship. There are 20 levels and 3 difficulties. Each difficulty has it's own monsters in different places. It has RPG elements and for hardcore gamers there's 1 huge levels which covers most of the ship.\n-Soundtrack. There are actually a bunch of memorable audio tracks!\n-Statistics. You can use Residentevil.net to check advanced stats.\n-Story. It's wacky, but it's quite well presented.\n-Survival horror. This game actually includes it.\n-Unlockables. Free items can be unlocked by spending points (which you can earn in different ways (no pay to win)).\n\nCons:\n-Characters. Some new characters are wacky/have wacky voice acting. Can be fixed by switching to Japanese audio.\n-Co-op. You can't play the main story in co-op. That's not exactly a con, but worth mentioning. Because it's pretty known that survival horror games should not be played in co-op.\n-Controls. They're quite tanky (especially when compared to RE6), however... you can counter/dodge (just like in RE3) and there's no real need to jump around.\n-DCLs. There are unique weapon and special character DLCs.\n-Enemies. The bosses sometimes come with other enemies which might get in your way.\n-Graphics. This is a port. There are improvements, but it's not exactly Ultra HD.\n-QTEs. When it comes to mechanics - just like any 3D RE there's a little bit of them... BUT... even less than in RE4.\n\nConsidering that I usually forgot about something feel free to post in the comments about things I forgot about.\nRight now REv is my favorite 3D RE game.","January 5, 2014","true","296.1"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","12","17","0","0"

Don't get me wrong though- this game does have some action elements (and they are very well implemented), but much of your time is spent cautiously navigating forboding environments and scavenging for supplies along the way. Yes, you can actually run short on ammo and health in this RE entry!\n\nGraphics: The game looks great, although some might scoff at a few muddy textures (keep in mind this is a 3DS port).\n\nSound: The sound design is stellar- great ambiance, sound effects, and grand orchestral soundtrack. Some tracks really get stuck in your head! The voice acting is pretty good and might sound cheesy at times, but that's the charm of RE!\n\nStory: The story is nice and complex- you won't get it if you bluff through the whole game without reading any side-notes.\n\nGameplay: The combat is unbelievably fun and satisfying. Dodging seems absurd at first, but it becomes very fun once you get the hang of it. There's even a Raid Mode for the combat-hungry fans!\n\nReplayability: This game is very fun to replay- if you're looking for a hard challenge, try Infernal Mode on NG+. If you're looking for a satanic challenge, try Infernal Mode on a new save. Everything is remixed and amped up A LOT in difficulty. New scares, new surprises, you get the idea. Want a very stressful survival horror experience? Try Infernal.\n\nLong story short, get this game if you like a nicely done survival horror. You won't regret it!\n\nMy rating: 9/10\n\nPS: In case anyone was wondering, this game is pretty creepy. No, it doesn't rely on cheap jump-scares (I think there was only one or two throughout the whole campaign) but rather works on building a fantastic atmosphere. Sometimes, the sense of dread can be overwhelming, especially on Infernal Mode.","January 9, 2014","true","170.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","2"

It somehow feels completely divorced from how big publisher games are supposed to be made today. It probably has to do with its heritage as a 3DS title. Everything about Revelations feels old school, in the style of Capcom from the late 90s and early 2000s.\n\nWhether you like this game or not will depend entirely on your affinity for the older Resident Evil titles. I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve finished Resident Evil 1, and Resident Evil 4 is just a masterpiece, especially on Gamecube with its superior controller. Revelations combines elements of both of them. For some reason the ship you spend the majority of the game on has an interior that seems almost modeled after the Resident Evil 1 mansion, and larger encounters copy the arena style combat of Resident Evil 4 to great effect. I don’t think there’s any game out there which can make you feel as panicky as Resident Evil 4 & 5 when you’re running away from a mob, trying to find a good spot to deal with the masses. Revelations brought those feelings back.\n\nEvery imaginable Resident Evil trope is present here. There’s a sci-fi lab near the end, there’s a guy in a helicopter throwing you a rocket launcher to help you fight a boss, there’s a self destruct sequence with a timer ticking down. And it all works. Even the music sounds like proper Resident Evil. It’s a synth orchestra for the majority of the soundtrack, but it tries its best to be as epic as it can. It even has opera singers, exactly in the style of Resident Evil 2.\n\nI had a great time with this game. It put a big smile on my face, and reminded me of why I like this silly franchise so much. If you don’t give a crap about Resident Evil then you will probably not have as good of a time as I did. But if you’ve played a bunch of the games in the series and enjoyed them, then this is a must play.\n\nA final note, the demo is terrible. It’s the opening 15-20 minutes of the game, which are by far the weakest. The second after the demo ends is when the game gets good, and unfortunately they didn’t include any of that in the demo. I got the game because every RE fan who had played it kept going on about how good it was. And they were right.","January 3, 2014","true","9.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CounterLife/recommended/222480/","CounterLife","« Counter-Life™ »","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CounterLife/","98 products in account","Resident Evil: Revelations is the first game in RE's "Revelations" series, it's mainly focused on events that are not directly connected to the main series.\n\nThe game starts with Jill and a new character, Parker Luciani, as they are ordered by the BSAA to look for Chris & Jessica (another new character) on a ship called "Queen Zenobia". The game takes place in 2005, about one year before the events of "Lost in Nightmares".\n\nFirst off, let me start with the setting. The "Queen Zenobia" makes for a great setting, it's atmospheric, mainly consists of tight corridors, and feels great to explore. Some other scenarios include Chris & Jessica or Quint & Keith (Again, new characters) wandering through a snowy mountain region and a kind of "flashback" scenario that shows the Terragrigia Panic. I don't want to talk further about the plot, since it would just spoil things.\nI think that the Queen Zenobia is overall the best setting.\n\nSecondly, the graphics. This game is a HD port of a Nintendo 3DS game, meaning that the graphics are not anything to brag about. However, I think they are sufficent enough to underline the mostly dark atmosphere. All the cutscenes are pre-rendered aswell.\n\nThe gameplay is fairly slow-paced. It mainly feels like RE4/RE5 with some modernizations like walking while aiming/reloading. RE3's dodge mechanic also makes a return. Each character only has one, unique melee move. Ammo is very important, and enemies will be able to lower your health considerably with just one hit. The healing mechanic is simple: You press a button, your health refills. You can aquire a variety of weapons, but as so often you start off with your trusty old Beretta (Yes, this game uses real life weaponry). You can upgrade your guns with parts that you can find throughout the levels. These parts will, for example, increase the critical hit chance, damage or firing rate. Each weapon only accepts a certain number of parts at once.\n\nSomething I somewhat dislike about the game are the silly character designs and some story elements. Most characters look out of place compared to the rest of the RE series, while others look as you would expect a BSAA/FBC field operative to look. The worst happened to Jill, as they decided to remodel her face for some reason. Horrible design choice.\nThe whole Terragrigia plot seems to be a bit too sci-fi to me (An on water floating city that gets destroyed by a parabolic reflector satellite), and again, dosen't really fit into the rest of the events.\nOther than that I thought the plot was pretty good, better than Revelations 2 if you ask me.\n\nThis is also the first time we get to play Raid Mode. This gamemode is focused on combat, and is mainly about getting from A to B, destroying foes and looting ammo/weapon cases/parts on your way. I'm a big fan of Raid mode, in both Rev and Rev2. It's a huge grind fest, but if you are into that kind of stuff then you will love Raid Mode. The Trinity reward makes the mode more challenging than in Rev2, since it requires you to take no damage throughout the whole stage (among two other requirements).\n\nOverall, I really like Revelations, I think it's a good mix between survival horror and action. Get it during sale.\n\nFinal verdict: 7.6/10","May 23","true","26.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I was interested before, but life happened, and I kind of forgot about RE. So yeah, I'm a huge fan of the series. I saw this at the mall, so I decided to buy it.\n\nWell... WOW. This game is a blast.\n\nAfter the incredible disappointments that were ORC and RE6 which were released the same year, I thought that the RE series would only go downhill. But then I played this game. And it rocks.\n\nThe gameplay is basically the same as RE6, but instead of being more action based, it's actually scary. Yeah, you hear that? SCARY. Capcom decided to stop ♥♥♥♥ing around, making the game feel more horror based than action based, which is stunning. The atmosphere is fantastic and Queen Zenobia is one of the most interesting settings for a RE game. Capcom finally heard what the fans wanted and they delivered perfectly.\n\nThe plot is great too. The characters are all memorable, the whole Terragrigia backstory is pretty interesting and it's pretty nice to have Jill back.\n\nAnother thing I really like is the way the chapters work. Every chapter contains 3 sub chapters as I call them (there are exceptions of course). The first sub chapter describes the main events of the game with Jill and Parker and the rest may either continue directly what happened with those two or describe a different POV of what happened or a flashback. I find this idea to be mildly interesting and it's done pretty well in this game.\n\nHowever, this game is not perfect, and it has a lot of issues. First of all, some of the enemies and the bosses you fight are ultra cheap. What I mean is that if you don't avoid these enemies (which is pretty hard by itself), they will kill you instantly with one hit. That is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I know it doesn't happen too often, but it's still a pain in the ♥♥♥.\n\nThe raid mode is also pretty addicting and it feels very different than any other generic TPS multiplayer mode of most games nowadays.\n\nShould you buy this game?   Yes. It's one of the best RE games out there and this game puts the other RE games that came out that year to shame. Fans will love this game, no matter how die-hard of a fan you are. It's proof that a RE game doesn't have to be centered around zombies or Raccoon City to be great. I utterly recommend this game. Go play it now.

The Raid mode, a separate game mode that lets you play through the stages of the game to gain levels, find items and earn money to help you in progressing to the later levels.

It's a mix of the classic style RE games and the action of RE4 in the sense that while it’s still more actiony compared to the old games it tends to share elements like the pacing and confined areas. While it has its flaws, I think it works well enough and plays a lot better than RE5, which was a mess. Revelations isn't really scary but the game never acts like it is, it’s like RE4 in that the team knew the game is like a cheesy actiony B horror movie and they ran with it (Though not nearly as much as RE4 did) As a fan of both RE4 (One of my favorite games) and the classic series I think Rev is a nice installment in the series and hopefully Revelations 2 can continue in keeping the series afloat.","November 30, 2014","true","17.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It's a damn fine port. It runs like butter on my Radeon HD 7770 and 2.9 ghz x4. Only bit of performance issues is the loading of areas, but that never interfered with the gameplay.\n\nThough the environment was kind of small in the overall scheme of the game, it was charming and I grew fond of it.\n\nGameplay wise, it was quite good. It never felt samey. There were sequences that defied the usual combat of the game (I won't spoil it), which were arcady and they were arcady in a GOOD way. My only complaint is the final boss fight was a huge spike in difficulty.\n\nThe story was interesting. I think you may want to have at least a basic familiarity with Resident Evil in order to get what's going on, though you don't need to have that understanding in order to enjoy the game.\n\nOverall, this is a FUN game.

Resident Evil Revelations was one of those times. I do have to say, Revelations didn’t fail as much as Resident Evil 4 did in my eyes – you can read my review on RE4 in about 30 seconds.\n\nI knew fully well that the Resident Evil series is one heck of a console port family, but I gave it shot anyways. The Humble Bundle offer was too tempting not to take, heck I could even make sure the developers didn’t get any coin from me. So it ticked all the right boxes from the start.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=539323466\n\nStrangely enough the title grew on me, but I enjoyed watching it more than playing. I was able to lend this title out to a friend of mine, and they seemed to enjoy playing it.\n\nThe plot is ok, I wouldn’t give it 10 out of 10, but it does the job. The one thing I noticed right off the bat was the use of checkpoints. Oh my, do I hate them. The linear gameplay felt like it took a page out of a mobile game design textbook, with narrow passage ways and over the shoulder view. Tie in the “tape your face to the screen” field of view – I don’t see myself playing this game on my PC. I’d have to play in on a big screen, on my couch with a steam controller.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=538996919\n\nCOOP is ok, but requires the other player to match your progression in the main story line. This can kind of be an annoyance as really you should just be able to play together without one of you having to go and catch up with the other.\n\nWith all of the negatives, there are fixes luckily. I was able to use a save file from someone else to match their progress, and there are widescreen fixers that work with this game.  Using fixers for the FOV do cause issues with COOP, so be forewarned.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=539323424","March 13","true","1.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

There is nothing like being in the middle of the ocean on a tightly confined cruise ship with infected monsters seeking blood. With each turn down a corridor or opening of a door you always be thinking to yourself about what could be waiting for you there. You will also find yourself checking every nook and cranny just to make sure you have killed everything, only to find that all of a sudden out from the depths of an elevator shaft or air duct comes a slimy eight foot monster reaching out to lend you a hand. While I was surprised by, and at times felt some of the pressure of, too many enemies, I quickly realized that they tend to be rather dumb and sluggish and that I could just run away.\n\nRevelations looks incredibly good considering this is a DS port.  Graphics are not grounbreaking but are nice and have decent effects that are utlitized well on the PC.  I really enjoyed the character models myself and thought that Jill looked good as well as the rest of the cast. The sound and music are typical RE flare and add a great sense of ambience and spooky moods.\n\nWhat is consistent throughout all Resident Evil games is the sense of anxiety when blowing through a ton of ammo and feeling like you are on the verge of not having enough, when low and behold the ammo gods bless you with more. One of the new ways the game has you searching for ammo and health outside of the usual opening of lockers and smashing of boxes is by using the Genesis.  The Genesis is a scanner that detects items around the environment that wouldn't normally be seen with the naked eye. The scanner can also be used on the enemy, and with each successful scan you accumulate a percentage number; when the numbers total up to 100% you are rewarded with a health potion.\n\nYes this is not RE6, which I have not played but it is very fun and has decent story length of gameplay.  There is replayability also with New Game modes and Multi/CoOp play.  Remember that flashy graphics and latets tech does not always equal a stellar game usually it is the gameplay that makes ot breaks it... again RE6 seems to have been disappointing from what I have read, so I opted for this game instead and am gald I did.  It brings back that old school Resident Evil feeling and that I have missed lately.","November 8, 2013","true","32.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Spartan717/recommended/222480/","Spartan717","Echo419","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Spartan717/","507 products in account","Back to its roots... sorta.\n\nResident Evil: Revelations is an action-horror game developed by Capcom. Set in between Resident Evil 4 and 5, you play as series veterans Chris and Jill (as well as other members of the BSAA) to uncover a sinister plot which threatens the world.\n\nThe plot is descent, if somewhat jumbled. Chris and Jill have established the Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance (BSAA) an organisation bred to prevent and eliminate bio-terrorism. You can follow most the plot, however the 'flashback' sections and switching between four characters might leave people confused.\n\nSound effects do a great job at instilling a creepy atmosphere. Creepy music is played during the scenes on the deserted ship. Action music is played during the shooty segments. Weapons sound as they should. The voice acting of the main charcters (ie Chris and Jill) are good, however the other characters acting range between boring or annoying (which isn't a surprise for veterans of resident evil).\n\nGameplay is the highlight here. The game is split into episodes, with each one playing either Chris, Jill or other members of the BSAA. Taking on elements from previous entries (mainly 4,5,6), gameplay is a mix of horror, action and puzzle solving. When playing Jill's segments, the campaign is close to survival horror with close quaters, puzzle solving, moving back and forth areas, limited ammo and intense fights. While playing as Chris and other characters however, the game becomes an action game (similar to resi 6) with lots of ammo, linear levels, limited horror and puzzles. Unlike other games in the series, you don't have an inventory system where you have to manually move items like guns, ammo and herbs around. You can only carry three weapons (ie pistol, magnums, shotguns, smg, rifles). There are no stores in the game, so you can't buy weapons and ammo. Instead you will need to find these items during your play through. There are weapon containers located somewhere in the area which you can use to store primary weapons and switch between them should the need arises. The game also saves automatically during various points in the game and at the end of each episode.  Only the green herb is prevailent in this game and it basically restores full health (like green + red combination). You can only carry a limited number of them, but they can be used via pressing a single button to quickly regenerate loss health. There is also no healthbar in the game, with the a larger area of the screen turning red as you recieve damage. Similar to resident evil 5, you generally have an ai partner to assist you in each episode. Thankfully, you don't have to baby sit them (as they as invincible) and don't do much damage anyway (leaving most of the action to you). Partners do assist you in reaching different areas and offer some banter and weak distractions for enemies. There are variety of creatures you face including dogs, various ooze monsters (which can either have melee or range attacks), hunters etc which each have weakpoints. There are also terryfying bosses to contend with which require different strategies and tatctics to defeat. A personal improvement is the removal of quicktime events, which often forced the player to press randomised buttons quickly or spam them (especially during cutscenes) to avoid an 'unfair' death.  A new addition to the game is a scanner which you can equip to locate items on the map, find hand prints or find enemy weakpoints.\n\nBesides the main campaign there is also raid mode.  In raid mode, you need to reach the exit by going through areas on the each map. As you move to the exit, enemies may spawn which can either be eliminated or avoided. There are three special challenges which are not getting hit, eliminate all enemies and doing both of them. There are plenty of maps to choose from which new ones unlocked by completing previous ones. There are three  diffculty levels per map which alters the enemies strengths and changes which foes spawn. After each stage you earn credits which you can use to buy weapons, ammo, grenades etc via the store. You also earn expereince points to level up in order to acquire stronger weapons. Weapons may be either bought from the store or found during raid matches.There are a variety of character skins to choose from, with each one having a uniques set of perks which alter how well they use certain weapons. New characters are unlocked via playing the campaign or completeing raid mode missions.\n\nControls are a step up from previous entires. The mouse controls are great. You can also move and aim at the same time. You move at a slower pace than resi 5, but faster than 4. You can also sprint. Overall it feels less clunky than previous installments in the series.\n\nGraphics are decent, especially for 3DS port. The dark lighting in the ship scenarios do a excellent job at creating a creepy atmosphere. Textures, while not as good as resident evil 6, are a huge improvement over the 3DS counterpart.\n\nIf you are looking for a resident evil game with both horror and action, more modern controls and no annoying quicktime events, this game will not dissappoint.","April 5, 2015","true","96.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This game was really good even though there were somethings that were kind downers. For example, the enemies, they arent old school fun to kill zombies, no. They are some kind of boring mutant, who cant be dismembered or anything awesome. Then you have the mechanics which are kinda weird like dodging, for example. The story is super super good the only thing is that it might be kinda boring at first, but it gets better with time. Coop on raid mode is very very good, but unfortunately you have to play the whole campaign to unlock the different stages for Raid Mode.\nNow those things like the gameplay and the enemies, I think it might be because it was a Nintendo 3DS game at first but anyways, the game is pretty cool.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathwing107/recommended/222480/","deathwing107","Deathcon 4","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathwing107/","125 products in account","Keep in mind that this game was initially a Nintendo 3DS game that was ported to console and PC after the fact. The graphics and animations might seem a little dated because of this. That being said, this port is not bad at all, at least for PC. The graphic quality resembles Resident Evil 4.\n\nGameplay and controls are very well done. It's 3rd person over the shoulder. Campaign is singleplayer only but you will have an AI partner. Your partner... isn't the best or most helpful, but thankfully they won't cause a game over if they get hit too much and sometimes serve as a nice distraction, except on bosses. Difficulty ranges from easy early on and nicely becomes more challenging toward the end.\n\nThere is one glaring problem with the gameplay though. The dodge mechanic is incredibly shoddy. On a 360 controller, you're supposed to press A and a direction at the same time to avoid an attack at the right time, but it only ever seemed to work half the time I did it. Either it's broken or the timing needs to be perfect, but it's very frustrating. I also had an incredible amount of frustration with 2 of the Bosses in this game due to their rather odd mechanics, one of which isn't helped by the wonky dodging.\n\nThis game is a LITTLE short, but that's forgivable since it was initially a 3DS game. It's also broken up into 14 episodes, some of which are very short. It also makes the game feel disjointed, because you'll be flashing back to earlier events a lot. It's mostly non linear on the ship later on in the game once you progress, so you can go back and find different weapons, ammo, health, and weapon mods (the weapons and the different mods are a great aspect to this game).\n\nThe game's story is very interesting with a nice plot twist. You'll be playing and partnering with a bunch of very interesting new and returning characters, with Jill Valentine the one you'll be playing the most and the only one who can access the weapons and mods you find.\n\nSide note: I had an issue with the cutscenes having audio desync issues, but I'm not sure if this is only my issue.\n\nOverall, if you're a Resident Evil fan, you're gonna want to play this game, as the story alone is worth it and captures the mood from the earlier games in the series, with some new elements as well as other elements from later games in the series. Other than that I recommend waiting until it is on sale if you want to play it. But you'll be getting your money's worth.\n\nI haven't tried Raid Mode, but that may add some replay value if you're interested.","November 2, 2014","true","10.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I remember how scared I was as kid playing first Resident Evil game on Playstation console. I had tons of fun and scary jumps and even after so many years old Resident Evil games can scare me to death. I saw fall down of Resident Evil games when the sixth main entry in franchise was released yet I still remained a fan of it.

There must be something fishy going around... yup, another bad game in series!". I truly regret saying those things. Resident Evil Revelations made it on PC later than infamous Resident Evil 6. To be honest, I didn't expected much. Some action game, maybe again full of QTEs but since it's Resident Evil game I will try my best do enjoy it. Well, I didn't needed to try much because Resident Evil Revelations is one big surprise.\n\nPrologue made me really into this game. It's mix of old Resident Evil formula and the new one. There is still action but much more less of it than in Resident Evil 5 and 6. For the first time after so long I felt like game in this franchise have something more - yup, this magical atmosphere of horror! Even without tanky controls, limited field of view and zombies, there is a Resident Evil game that can be enjoyed even by fans of older RE titles.

Maybe Jill's lower back of body...\n\nSo moving from the "general" things, there is this Raid Mode. It's like a mixed Mercenaries mode from 4/5/6 and from Resident Evil 3. You don't need to kill enemies ASAP and makes your score big. You simply moves from point A to B and killing things on your way. With every completed stage you get exp, more powerful weapons, parts and some unlockables - next stages and alternative costumes for this mode. Amazing things is that after 2 years there are still events going on residentevil.net for it. If you will ever want to beat most hard stage in REvelations then you will need ultra rare weapons and parts they are giving for event participants or powerful friend.\n\nWhile I'm writing this review I'm sure that I have forgot about something.

The very famous "Resident Evil 4" paved the way for 3rd person survival horror. But since Resident Evil 5, the gore has dramatically declined. Mostly due to the fact that RE4 was banned in several countries and minimizing profits. However I believe profits are not the issue when it came to RE4 because so many people were buying it in the United States. This amazingly horrifying game recieved many awards from many gamers everywhere.\n\nBut enough with the little history report.\n\nResident Evil Revelations, I believe was okay. There wasnt much gore to start with and the female characters are in unbelievably "exposing" outfits. But then again, we are dealing with Japan here. So this was not much a surprise here. So basically you play as Jill Valentine along with her Puerto Rican sidekick, Parker in an attempt to save Jill's previous partner, Chris Redfield. However, it erupts into extreme controversey and deceit as you dig deeper as to what was the cause of infection at the beautiful shining city, Terragrigia and its untimely demise.\n\n*SPOILER*\nJessica is  HUGE ♥♥♥♥♥... just saying.\n\nAll in all, I really only recommend this game if you bought it when it was only like 12 dollars when it went on sale June 10, 2014 for Steam's "Mid-Week Madness. This game is basically Hentai but except with sex scenes replaced with the undead.","June 15, 2014","true","23.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Resident Evil 5 & 6 were particularly disapointing and only the co-op option managed to keep me playing until the end. Revelations does stand out.\n\nYou will be controlling Jill Valentine (for most of the game anyway) and explore an abandonned ship filled with monsters. It happens to be a descent Third Person Shooter with a few good ideas, like the "genesis", a scanner that can be used to find hidden objects and analyse your ennemies.\n\nLet's get rid of the cons first. The port is a little lazy, basically identical to the nintendo 3DS version, which makes it an amazing game for 3DS but a just ok game for PC. Though most of the game involves a compagnion AI, coop wasn't added to the game, which I find hard to understand. Then come the usual Resident Evil problems: the writing is pretty bad, scenario is much better than RE5&6 but tries to be overcomplicated for no real added value and you have some problems with the storytelling.\n\nThen why should I recommand this game ? Well first of all, the main point of any good Resident Evil game is here: the atmosphear. Though not particularly scary, the game immersse you in its environment. The graphics are absolutely descent (I still can't believe they managed to put that on a 3DS). The game features some surprisingly attaching side-kicks for a Resident Evil game and a few very well executed plot twists. The gameplay is entertaining and THANK GOD controls are not taken away from you all the time to show you pretty cutscenes in a middle of action scenes (hello Resident Evil 6).\n\nIn conclusion, Resident Evil Revelations is not a mind blowing experience but definitely enjoyable. Let's hope the next Resident Evil will be inspired by Revelations and not the dreadful Resident Evil 6.","January 8, 2014","true","12.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The graphics / FMV are lush in places but show there 3DS origins in places, the controls are tight (as far as an RE game is concerned) and the most importantly the gameplay is nice.\n\nThe main reason the gameplay is good is because of the even pacing between item finding / scaning, light puzzling and exploration mixed in with the combat. Also you 'WILL' have to watch the ammo as you'd expect in a true survival horror and the best thing is the main setting is spot on, the ship is very reminiscent of RE1's mansion even in puzzle / interaction elements and the light backtracking required to unlock a weapon or open that room previously locked by a symboled key, love it, feels like a true RE game in 3d clothing for me, keep on this route Capcom!\n\nPS.

The main campaign was fun to play and the story was interesting to follow. The level design is nice - most of the game takes place on a cruise ship, and the designers keep you revisiting old areas by using different keys to access new rooms and content. After you beat the regular story mode, you can continue to revisit the areas in a Raid mode, where you have different stages with increasingly levelled enemies. This Raid mode I found to be quite fun, but I feel you need to do a bit of grinding to level up properly and to have enough currency to upgrade your gear.\n\nControls are okay, I've played with keyboard and a mouse - for some reason strafing is incredibly slow, unlike in other games.

But REV still doesn't quite capture the atmosphere that older games had, because there is still another NPC working besides you. Although most of the time they are quite useless in fights.

At least they can't die, or this game would likely have been deleted and a refund sought.\n\nHorribly outdated graphics (Looks like an early xbox 360 on Ultra).\nAnnoying camera, your character taking up most of the field of view in the cramped environments.\nNo character development with needless love story undertones thrown in for good measure.\n\nMy main beef with this game however is the eminent lazyness obvious throughout, frequent backtracks (At one one point you are asked to fight through the same area again are just beating it).\n\nLazy writing obvious from the ludicrous amount of plot holes and very basic, cliche dialogue.\n\nLazy animations for basic tasks (when cutting a door open you blowtorch the centre and it falls over)\n\nLazy level design, I seriously have to manually open each door and watch the animation? Doors close automatically?\nEnvironments look the same, difficult to tell apart, non inuitive and results in a lot of wondering (The map is no help whatsoever, also lazy.)\n\nThe AI is lazy, BOW dogs literally run at you, dart back to original position and enter the attack animation.\nEnemies are lazy, BOW dogs come in 2 varieties, small and grey, big and black. The main enemies througout use largely the same character model with slight adjustments for ranged and melee opponents.\n\nWhilst the game is largely easy it experiences 2/3 incredible difficulty spikes, completing most missions without a death on normal, at these spikes I died 5+ times each.\n\nVery poor optimization is obvious, entering new areas which are really not that large or detailed needs 15/20 seconds of in game loading and a serious stutter in frame rate. This is also a travesty considering the game environment is very small, a ship at night, undoubtably to save on dev time.\n\nCopy and paste story from previous RE games, bad gameplay and bad optimization makes this game the final nail for Capcom.\n\nI bought this game for 10 euros, unless it goes down to 5 or less and you've a day of boredom ahead, spend that ten euro on six cans of booze, you'll get more enoyment out of it.","June 11, 2014","false","12.5"," 54 of 104 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","54","104","0","5"

Storytelling is episodic and gameplay is what you would expect from any other resident evil game with a twist of action, you get to play as many different characters on many different missions folding into eachother to tell this decent and very interesting Resident Evil story.\n\nTheres even a "Raid Mode" that you can unlock by playing the entire 8 to 10 hour campaign. Raid Mode will have you run through familiar terrain killing water zombies with large health bars for rank, bonuses, enemy spoils, BP and EXP. You can play with a friend or test yourself. I would say this is the equivelant of Zombies in COD.\n\nI give this game a 7/10 for its decent story and familiar gameplay with the addition of Raid Mode and New Game+. Hopefully in the very near future the franchise will start making newer Resident Evils with the originals in complete thought.","May 20","true","9.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The campaign is absolutely survival-horror, it's actually the best survival-horror game I've ever played. You're outnumbered by creatures you've never even seen before, and trying to escape the Queen Zenobia (it's set on an abandoned ship) alive. This definetely gave me a good couple of scares, and some of the creatures you'll encounter will seriously creep you out (Rachel, anyone?). After you've finished the campaign, you can start a new game+, which allows you to replay the game with all your current gear, to relive the horror once more. There are 30 handprints to find throughout the campaign, which gives achievement hunters some satisfaction in searching. Once you're through the campaign, your fun has only begun; as there is also Raid Mode to accompany it. Raid Mode is a great multiplayer experience that allows you to go through sections of the game as stages, and each time you complete a stage you'll get new weapons and/or weapon parts, depending on how well you've done. There are a multitude of stages to do, as well as 3 difficulties to do them all in. If multiplayer isn't really your thing, you can do Raid Mode solo if you like. The price tag may be $50, but it is well worth it as you'll definetely clock in a considerable amount of hours. This is a great gmae to get if you're either looking to get into the Resident Evil series, find a good survival-horror game, or just want to have a really fun time.

Not to mention that it is actually priced *higher* than Resident Evil 6 (despite 6 having more content, higher production value, and (arguably) more thought behind it).\n\nOkay, some things I liked. Keeping in mind that it was a port of a mobile game, it actually looks pretty good at times. The weapon customisation, while not stellar, was still pretty nice. Raid mode is also pretty nice, if you like grindfests (I do).\n\nBut really, people tout this game as returning to the roots of the series, which I certainly think it tried to do, but it just falls short. Why? Ammunition is plentiful, sense of dread and the fear of what lies around the corner is gone, puzzles are pretty much nonexistant, no inventory management to speak of and decisions of fight or flight are never really made.\n\nThat's just comparing it to the classic games, mind you.\n\nOn top of that, I think there's a lot of wasted potential here. I was excited for the game mainly because of two things: the setting and the enemies. I thought the setting would be perfect, combining survival horror with dreaded underwater segements, creating a truly fiendish monster of a game. I also thought the enemies were kind of wierd and abstract looking, and I thought a lot could be done with underwater creatures affected with a new kind of virus.\n\nWhat you get instead is a very straightforward corridor shooter. The enemies are basically reskinned zombies (regular zombies, strong zombie, zombie with a gun, fat zombie etc.) and the underwater segments are actually few and far between. Not to mention the underwater segments are *less* scary than the dry segments, thanks to a "Mario 64"-like water-surfacing-health-regeneration system.\n\nThe plot, like most RE games, is silly. But not only that, its just not entertaining. The voice acting is pretty questionable too. It's nice to see Chris Redfield back, looking & sounding like he does in RE5 and 6 (although it sounds a little like hes just phoning his performance in this time), but unfortunately Jill has received a visual and audible makeover, making her just a stranger in the room. The other characters are pretty bland and uninteresting, and the emotional 'high point' of the story amounts to an anti-climax, where it turns out a guy that was meant to die just got a crippy leg.\n\nAnyways, mostly just a big dissapointment in the untapped potential that a sea-based isolated setting could provide for a game like this. And, okay, I appreciate that they ported the game to other systems so a wider audience can play it, but I really question the decision to price a port of a mobile game as high as a regular AAA title.","October 18, 2013","true","65.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

The campaign mode is engaging and well thought out with an Alan Wake-style episode system, constantly changing points of view, playable characters, and fleshing out more and more of the setting.  The Raid mode is bare bones until the campaign is unlocked; then, you get to work solo or with an ally using the roster from the main game in various maps with a good bit of challenge.

It's not bad, by any particular means outside of story and character dialog (it's not even cheesy, it's just very, very, very bad) but it sure as heck is NOT a return to its roots.\n\nIt's basically a mix of 5 and 6 with some aspects of 4, but only a tiny bit, thrown in for good measure. It has customizeable weapons similar to 4, it has terribly boring, generic and uncompelling enemies similar to 5, and the overall gunplay/damage/mindlessness of 6.\n\nAt fifty bucks this game is a total rip off, even with RAID mode and co-op (both of which do add a lot of fun to this otherwise terrible story and mediocre gameplay/enemies). It can be beat at very leisure 6 hours. Get it massively on sale and don't buy into the mindless hype. This is still a VERY modern Resident Evil and that isn't always a good thing. Play this then play Code Veronica or heck the remake of 1 and say this game is about horror.

The game has its plus points.....Chris & Jill, Veltro, the general plot, the mansion-esque interiors of the ship, the underwater areas, weapon attachments, the Genesis (to a degree) and omission of the tank like controls, however, it lets itself down in several key areas.\n\nAside from Chris and Jill the other characters are hokey to say the least, *cough* Jackass? *cough*. Raymond and Jessica pick up some slack but are let down by exceptionally cheesey dialogue even for a RE game, this is widespread across all characters in RE:R. The episodic nature of the game hops and jumps around across characters/timelines/locations to the point where story and gameplay don't flow. The visuals whilst impressive for a handheld port on closer inspection reveal some awful looking textures. Gameplay elements such as the Genesis are initially fun but again personally I found it very apparent that this was something that was designed with a second screen in mind i.e. the second screen of a handheld or the controller screen of a Wii U. Genesis fealt pointless after the first few chapters, an idea that hadn't been fully realised, not even on the games lead platform which was a great shame as it would have been excellent usage of a secondary handheld screen.\n\nIt's an 8-10 hour campaign, it's enjoyable in spurts. It's not the modern day savior of the series as some people would have you believe, not even close. It's light on horror, heavy on gunplay and another game in the series which will divide fans.","October 6, 2014","true","8.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

While it's still fun to play theres a few things people should know before buying. The overall gameplay is not as deep as recent RE games.\n\nThe "coop" is not like other RE games you cannot play the campaign coop. This was a major disapointment for me as I bought 2 copies to play with the missus. The coop they advertise is only the minigame you can play on the side and even then it's nothing like the Fight for your life maps in mercenaries mod like re 4 5 and 6. It's more of a small mission to get from point A to point B collecting xp and leveling up. I didn't like it anywhere near as much as it just seems like a grind rather then the frantic carnage that is mercenaries.\n\nI'm going to say no to recommending this game, Not because its bad like operation racoon city was but just because I can't imagine any of my friends enjoying it. It's good for a DS/vita game. Unfortunately it just can't compete with the big boy RE games.","June 11, 2014","false","26.1"," 61 of 119 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","61","119","0","7"

Surprising since this is a remaster from a 3DS game.\n+It's closer to the style of the originals than the recent numbered releases.\n+I actually liked the upgrade system for the guns. A lot of times you wouldn't have a lot of parts, so it made you think about what weapons you use the most, or what ones you had the most ammo for.\n\nCons\n-Really clunky controls. Sad, but this is coming from a 3DS game. I even played with a controller, assuming that would help, but it really didn't.\n-Story. An incident happens that you don't care about, so you try and cover it up for a corporation you don't care about, there was something about a city that I'm sure the citizens care about... Some boat no one cares about... For a brief period of time you play as two guys no one cares about... It's pretty impressive to not care this much. None of the new characters seem unique or interesting in the slightest, and as a result a LOT of this game feels like filler.\n-Puzzles are tedious. Go here, collect this, suddenly a new area opens up, we get it.\n-Enemies. Hint: Enemies aren't scary if they take a million shots to kill and your only threat is running out of ammo in a room where enemies infinitely respawn! That's just called annoying.\n\nTo be fair, there is a bit of lore between Chris and Jill that may be neat for a Resident Evil fan.

Acredite em mim, jogue no teclado/mouse, principalmente se for jogar no Infernal, este inclusive é ao mesmo tempo um ponto positivo, a jogabilidade foi PERFEITAMENTE adaptada para o teclado/mouse, muito fluído e fácil.\nEu não costumo escrever reviews, quem me conhece sabe o quanto sou chato e exigente e que só escrevo review quando o jogo é bom e vale a pena, então compre. Se não tiver grana sobrando, espere uma promoção qualquer e compre, me adicione e me chame para jogar um raid.\n\nI'm not a fan of Resident Evil, I only have played RE 1, 2, 3 and Code Veronica, after that I just feel pain for every RE out there. Capcom did a great job to revive the real old times in RE Revelations, with a great story and very good gameplay we have the raid mode, a co-op online with some RPG elements that simply works perfectly in RE.\nWe have only two 'cons', the graphics and the joystick gameplay.\nWe have a port here, so you will not get stuned for a graphic awesomeness moment, but it's just ok.\nThe joystick gameplay isn't good, but at the same time Capcom did a great job in the keyboard/mouse adaptation so believe me, play in keyboard/mouse.\nI start the game playing my first time directly in the Infernal game difficulty, it's very hard but worth, the game have a great atmosphere of difficulty similar to Dark Souls, you need to know how to shot and take advantage of the game cause you don't have too much herbs and ammo, so prepare to die.\nReally worth every cents.","June 14, 2014","true","34.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlueVoltron/recommended/222480/","BlueVoltron","RobotSpammer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlueVoltron/","145 products in account","\nHaving grown up with the earlier Resident Evils and suffering through the mess that was Resident Evil 5, I had little hope that Capcom could recover from the damage they've done to the franchise. But, hey, they thankfully proved me wrong with a game that was originally a 3DS spin off. With Revelations, the series once again gains survival horror like settings, atmosphere, and mechanics while still maintaining all the improvements made with the controls.\n\nFor the older fans: You'll get a decent amount of survival horror atmosphere, along with the ammo conservation mechanics. It's nowhere near the golden days of Resident Evil 1-CV but it's leagues above the stuff they pulled with Resident Evil 5. Heck, it's a start in the right direction right? The story as well actually feels like a throwback to the earlier games with a lot of chess moves going on in the background and you the player trying to figure out the mystery before the game reveals it. Of course most importantly, they brought the item chest back. I only serves to hold extra fire arms in this game but having inventory management in a RE game after such a long time, was a nice surprise.\n\nFor the newer fans: All the great things about Resident Evil 4's controls are still there, ammo isn't limited enough that you can't go on a small shooting spree on normal or lower difficulty, and action sequences are sprinkled through the entire game. So if you like the action side more of the franchise, you can have fun with Revelations with the understanding it's not 4 or 5 in terms of shooting everything that comes at you.\n\nTo wrap this up, this is a great game compared to the junk Capcom has released in the RE franchise these couple of years. Good story, exploration, running from enemies, good narrative, and interesting enemy designs(though they get repetitive after a while.) I hope Capcom lets the team behind this game continue to do their own thing of bringing back the series closer to its original form because fans will response to that with purchases. Meanwhile, Capcom can use the main series to continue to try and force a square peg in a round hole with their "No, no, it's not a rip-off of Call of Duty. It's action survival, trust us." With the magic that was Resident Evil 6, I'm sure that's working beautifully for them.\n","December 29, 2014","true","62.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/the_baka/recommended/222480/","the_baka","Powersocke","http://steamcommunity.com/id/the_baka/","227 products in account","Resident Evil Revelations is, for Resident Evil standards, and considering in which direction Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil 5 were going, a really good game, No kidding. To be fair, I liked Resident Evil 4 & 5 regardless. But Revelations makes a lot better than its predecessors.\n\nOn the positive side we have a lot of helpful features keeping the game fresh and making it stand out. You can now move while aiming and shooting, effectively increasing mobility and, above all else, fun. Seriously, how many times did we get annoyed by the "You are aiming and can not move" mechanic of the other games? Right, a lot. Also, your knife now functions by pressing the attack key without aiming providing quicker access to melee combat. It's still not spectacular or even helpful to fight with the knife and you're basically screwed if you have to resort to do so, but hey.\nThen there's your health bar.\nRemember how you got a single full health bar in RE 5 and no separate compartments, rendering any herb that wasn't combined with another useless? Well, they got completely rid of that by giving you no health bar at all but instead take a sort of CoD approach by having blood around the screen, indicating your life. If the screen becomes less colour saturated and there's a lot of blood on the edges of your screen, you better get healed.\nAlso, the healing system is more convenient. You now cancarry a set amount of herbs with you at any given time and you completely heal with a single herb upon the press of a single button, making it harder to waste herbs. Or easier, depending on you and how trigger-happy you are.\nStaying with "can carry a set amount of X", you can only carry so much ammo of one type with you. You can increase your maximum ammo capacity by collecting ammo pouches but as for your inventory, no space is stolen by ammo you don't need. You just collect ammo or any items for that matter of one type until you can not carry any more of this item, while all the other items still have room.\nYour inventory has been reworked, too. But I guess I just explained everything you need to know.\n\nAs for the story itself, it isn't all that bad actually. Well, it's a side story that surprisingly has nothing to do with Wesker whatsoever, but hey, it works. Huh. What else? Well, the graphics are better, there aren't any emblems to e collected anymore and instead of a classic merc mode you got the raid mode. Running through an obstacle course of enemies and trying to reach the end. Also, the raid mode now is the place where you unlock costumes for your characters in both campaign mode and raid mode.\nAnd last but not least: The horror's back! Well, at least a little. The game is dark, almost all of the time, the music in the background plays its role well, too. And some of the boss fights, especially the first real boss fight, gives you the feeling of "Oh my GOD goawaygoawaygoaway". Finally, some ray of hope for the series.\n\nBut there are also some serious downsides to the game.\nThe dodging mechanic is just horrendously complicated to execute. You dodge with either your space key (which is quick turn) or your W key (which is moving forward), making it nigh impossible to time your dodges correctly and you almost always end up getting hit. At other times, you just dodge at random without you even lifting a finger. Seriously, this is one screwed-up mechanic. I never actively tried to dodge because of that. Played through the game regardless.\n\nThe cutscenes have gotten worse for some reason. And I dunno how they screwed this up. I mean... it worked well in RE 5, why doesn't it work well in RER, too?\nAnd then there's the setting. The usual RE game takes place in one country and you travel to various locations within their boundaries to kill the end boss. In RER, the game takes place on a ship. One. Single. Ship. Can you imagine just how boring that setting can get? The first few hours of the game involve a LOT of backtracking and if you don't have a lot of patience you end up quitting the game and say "F*** it".\nLuckily, the ship is a big-♥♥♥ luxury liner with a lot of different-looking parts, like a huge dining hall, engine rooms, a pool... but overall it's the same ship. Some missions involve you going aboard another ship! :D ...only to then find out it's an exact copy of the ship you saw before. No, seriously, it even says so in the story.\nWell, the setting isn't all THAT bad tbh. I mean, there's the different areas of the ship(s). And then there are some playable flashbacks or playable missions carried out by other characters that take place simultaneously which are in completely different areas. You will see a big ship, a beach, snowy mountains and a lot of infested crap.\n\nThe enemies.\nWell, they are creative, I give 'em that. They are all sea-based so expect a lot of fishy things going on. As for classic zombies, you won't find any of them in this game. A lot of fish-human merged mutants comes your way instead. It's a nice thing but I was kinda weirded out the first couple of minutes.\nBut I have to say the story of that game seems kinda insignificant to me. It doesn't involve Umbrella in any way, there are no zombies (so to speak) and there is no Albert Wesker. It just doesn't seem like a major event, although the threat you are combating and considering what's at stake (if we are thinking about the BSAA for a minute) is pretty serious. But somehow it doesn't really convey that urgency we know from other titles. Perhaps they shouldn't have put in the major character cast of Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine.\n\nSpeaking of which, the amount of totally new characters is huge. So many new faces. Funny faces. By that I mean the game's got a lot of cheesy humour. I adore that, lightens up the experience and, if you switch on the Japanese voiceover, you'll feel like being in an anime. Also it was nice to see some fresh characters. I like the old ones, don't get me wrong, but something new is always a good idea. Well. Almost. *cough* Las Plagas *cough* (I didn't like the Las Plagas).\n\nAnyway...\nI gotta say: the game's pretty good! It's got some of its mojo back imo. And it has a lot of neat little features that make the game better than RE 4 & 5. If you liked RE 5, I recommend playing RER. It's a good game.","December 28, 2014","true","17.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

One of the strengths of RE is that they are able to bring any setting into the horror, and here it is no exception. I found myself genuinely creeped out by the many things on this haunted ship.\nHowever I wish they didn't change settings during the course of the game. Because of flashbacks and attempts to advance the plot, the game sometimes changes its setting to a city on fire or a mountain range, which aren't quite as scary. But it's a fairly minor quibble, as this game still manages to overal creep the player out.\n\nThe gameplay is reminiscient of RE4 and RE5, with lots of shooting abound. But, I did appreciate the fact that ammo is actually quite limited in this gamel while past REs tend to have so much ammo you could go in guns blazing. This game, while it does have a noticeable amount of ammo, you had to be a bit careful in how much you were shooting. Granted, it isn't as scarce as in REmake, but go too trigger happy and you might just...well, die.\n\nI could go more in depth, but I'll probably bore you all.\nIn the other fields, I think the music and plot do a decent job at what they need to do. (Granted, the plot here isn't the greatest, but it's RE - when were they ever realistic?)\nI think overall, while this game didn't scare me as much as the early REs did, it does manage to stay true to its roots and give a great survival horror experience.","October 16, 2014","true","333.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It really didn't, the game wasn't scary and running out of ammo was never even close to being a problem. I also didn't like the hidden handprints, bringing out the genesis scanner to scan every single room slowing my walking speed down to a crawl was boring as ♥♥♥♥, finding objects such as medals hidden around a level as seen in previous re's was much more enjoyable.\n\nThat said, the game was alright. Shooting zombies was enjoyable enough, the mod system added some cool variety and the campaign didn't last too long. If you want an above average third person shooter, this could be it. Haven't tried out raid mode.\n\nHot tip: put infighter 3 and damage 7 on the M40A1 and no enemy will ever be a problem again.","October 16, 2014","true","29.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I would recommend this game and im hoping the Remake of RE 1 when is arrives isnt going to be a total murder scene, that would kill the franchise for me, in my opinion its already on its last legs due to other companies bringing out better survival horror games now adays and to be honest the "Resident Evil" name itsself is probably whats been keeping players hanging on but if they mess up on RE 1 by changing it to much i dont see them lasting long. Again in my opinion if your going to remake something remake it exactly as it is! but with better graphics I have the same gripe over movies a remake comes out and all of a sudden big vital chunk of the film has changed......

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/klarden/recommended/222480/","klarden","Kain Klarden","http://steamcommunity.com/id/klarden/","1232 products in account","Revelations is a rather interesting part of the Resident Evil series. On one hand, it does feel like a side-story, not part of the main series. On the other, it often plays more like what Resident Evil used to be, than the newest entries. It feels like a more focused and better put together game, than Resident Evil 6 (released same year). But at the same time, doesn't evoke the same feelings, RE6 does, feels like designers lacked confidence and built the game by the checklist, not by their inner desires.\nBasic gameplay and the main parts of the game are really well done. Controls and some of the principles feel almost a perfect fit for a potential remake of the classic RE games, both in a more survival horror auto-aim style, and survival action over the shoulder more action style. Stuff no longer falls from enemies (escept for rare cases of mini-boss encounters, most of which can be skipped), ammo is rather scarce, running away is very often a very viable and even preferable option. Many locations are very narrow, but there is a rather well implemented dodge move, which is quite important to master. There's more freedom of exploration and good old "hey I found a key, let's open the door from before" moments, than even in Resident Evil 4. Although, it never quite truly tries to go full RE0-CV in terms of allowing you to roam free, since game is divided into chapters and quite a lot of them limit your options by some story reasons.\nHowever, there's a bigger issue with chapters. Sadly, despite the main part of the game being good and very classic RE-like most of the time, developers constantly shoehorn boring, repetitive and action heavy chapters from other characters perspectives into the flow of the game. Those tend to reuse areas from before, don't use the same weapon/herb/weapon upgrade setup as the main game and are, ultimately, completely disposable except for several key moment, which could've been done as non interactive cutscenes and nothing of value would've been lost. Part of the reason behind their existance is probably due to Capcom's fear, that game will sell less if there's not enough action in it.\nAnd another part is due to the silly story the game has. Now, Resident Evil games always had silly stories, but they tend to be awesomely silly, when you know that events you're watching unfold are dumb, all the characters are quite over the top, but it's so awesome you can't help but love it. And, besides, there was always a layer of seriousness in the story, which made for a good contrast with all the silliness. RE6 is that. Revalations is not. It's just plain stupid, always trying to look smart with all the plot twists and out of order side-chapter releals. But at the end of the day, it's just all dumb, full of new characters with crazy outfits and hairstyles, whom we will never ever see again, most likely, apart from the main duo of Chris and Jill and one small character, who had minor appearence in RE5. Also, Parker is quite clearly the result of developers wanting to have Barry Burton but not being able to for story reasons. And also, Jill is rather weirdly redesigned and looks a bit creepy.\nCreepy mostly due to the fact, that this game wasn't vastly visually improved over the 3DS version, so facial animations are crap, and many models and textures are rather "meh". Game still looks quite good, but there's a huge difference between it and RE6 even in how dynamic enemies' reactions to being shot are in RE6, and how boring shooting enemies in Revelations is. It doesn't detract much enjoyment from the game, but is rather noticeable.\nThere's also an interesting bonus mode, called Raid mode. Unlike RE4-style Mercenaries (which I could never get into, to be honest), it plays much more like Mercenaries: Operation Mad Jackal from RE3 or The 4th Survivor from RE2. There's no time limit (but time affects your rating), you don't *have* to kill every enemy, and the main point is getting to a specific place on the map. But along the way you can (and sometimes have to) kill enemies, potentially find ammo, upgrades and new weapons. It's a really fun mode that can be played solo or co-op. It has one big issue, though, which ties with the fact, that the game was designed to be portable. In a "gotta catch 'em all" way, there's a lot of stuff to get, get leveled up and such, but it's very grindy in nature, meant to be played in short bursts and gets quite repetitive fast otherwise. Hence, on a portable device it's a definitely more fun mode to play, than on a PC or console.\nOverall, a really solid game, with nice return to the oldschool ideals for most of the time, and disposable annoying sequences inserted inbetween the enjoyable main game.","April 1, 2014","true","34.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The weapon customization is deep and addicting, finding mods and combining them in a way that suits your playstyle is 50% of the fun. There's a downside to this : the early game is quite boring as you face lots of bullet sponge enemies with nothing but a peashooter. The shotgun you get after that is slightly better but it still pales in comparison to other Resident Evil games. It takes a few hours before you start to get weapons that have a visible impact on your foes. I'd go as far as to say the core game loop of shooting and improving your guns doesn't get really fun until new game +/infernal difficulty. Infernal difficulty is very smartly done, adding monsters in new places so you really gotta stay on your toes and use every tool at your disposal. The game becomes slower paced and you start to notice the little things, like the dynamic music, cool animations...it feels like the right way to play. It's a shame because I think a lot of people stopped after one playthrough.\n\nRandom thoughts :\n\n- Sidekicks need to go. They keep breaking the atmosphere by spouting out atrocious one liners, they deal virtually no damage and are immortal so you never care for them.\n- Raid mode is really good if you're into skinner box type of gameplay\n- I still don't know what the story's about\n- Jill sounds like a burned-out mom","November 13, 2015","true","24.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

Though the game still feels somewhat like a shooter, as opposed to a survival horror game, it captures a good bit of the feel of the original Resident Evil games, and while ammunition is plentiful, enemies take a significant number of rounds to take down, giving it more of a sense of desperation as ammunition supplies drain rather quickly. Overall, a fun enough game. 7/10.","October 18, 2013","true","11.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, the lack of CO-OP campaign as promised before release was a huge disappointment having your 2nd partner being simply and useless NPC that literally does no damage or anything beyond, just following you.\n\nAlso with this game comes the fimilar Raid Mode, though fun for hours eventually you will reach max level. At this point the Raid Mode takes a terrible dive in the fact at max level there are only 2-3 maps worth playing for any kind of progrerssion upgrades. This leads to a boring grind fest, doing the same waves, of the same spawn, in the same rooms, over and over.\n\nDue to the new flavor the game as offered over Raccoon City and RE6 I'd give this game a 7/10 and is worth playing.","December 5, 2015","true","96.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Nice environments, though they may get repetitive if you plan to replay a lot. Some scenes are not advised for people under the age limit. Great character design and shapes, especially on Jill and Rachel, and particular bosses.\n\nA lot of weapons and customization, character and weapon unlockables. Story is poor, like any other zombie game, there's outbreak, infection, bla-bla, we have to kill stuff and save earth. But what's important is the killing of things that are dead, because you don't really kill anything, because they are dead.\n\nIn this one you will mostly be on your own, in single player that is, usually you and your partner will be separated and occasionally meet up. In co-op mode however you play stages from selection of single player levels together with your friend, to clear the stage and not die. It's fun and may get boring after a while, like any repeatable thing, unless it's sex... well if you do 10-20 sexruns each day, you might get exhausted and also bored eventually.

The graphics are enhanced and the gameplay is actually pretty fun. When they released it on other platforms i had my sketpical thoughts on this game but in all honesty it is definitely a good game. Let me start by saying the story is interesting and it has a story play a lot like resident evil 6. By that i mean it alternates characters. The game is obviously fun, it has a bit more of an arcady feel to me but it still feels more like Resident evil 4 than the newer fast paced shooter versions. So to continue with this review let me say that the graphics aren't amazing. I mean the fingers look a bit blocky but i mean if you seriously are a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥ then i don't want to even see one of you people play Minecraft or any of these blocky games. The gameplay is smooth and the only issue i had was that it occasionally had a lag in frames.\n\nIf you're a resident evil fan this game is definitely one that you would most likely like to play. Not to mention the raid mode is really fun. Especially with the weapon drops makes it so you can play for hours.

However, this game ended up being one of my favourites of the series.\n\nAs fans of the series will know, the Resident Evil series changed a great deal with Resident Evil 4. And although that was a great game, it felt very different from its predecessors.\n\nLuckily, Revelaitons does a brilliant job of recapturing the feel and flavour of those classic Resident Evil games. The story may not be brilliant, but then again, the series was never renowned for its narrative. What's important is that Revelaitons gives a greater focus on delivering fear to the player, and the limited amount of ammunition forces you to pick your foes wisely.\n\nFor me, the original Resident Evil and Resident Evil Zero will remain my favourites of the series. Revelaitons, however, comes a close third.\n\nTrue Resident Evil fans will appreciate the cheeky little nods to previous entries of the series in this fantastic game filled with unspeakable creatures which leave you with nothing to say except, "what is this?"","June 30, 2014","true","12.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It was a reasonable length as well unlike some of the shorter single player games out there.

One of the strengths of RE is that they are able to bring any setting into the horror, and here it is no exception. I found myself genuinely creeped out by the many things on this haunted ship.\nHowever I wish they didn't change settings during the course of the game. Because of flashbacks and attempts to advance the plot, the game sometimes changes its setting to a city on fire or a mountain range, which aren't quite as scary. But it's a fairly minor quibble, as this game still manages to overal creep the player out.\n\nThe gameplay is reminiscient of RE4 and RE5, with lots of shooting abound. But, I did appreciate the fact that ammo is actually quite limited in this gamel while past REs tend to have so much ammo you could go in guns blazing. This game, while it does have a noticeable amount of ammo, you had to be a bit careful in how much you were shooting. Granted, it isn't as scarce as in REmake, but go too trigger happy and you might just...well, die.\n\nI could go more in depth, but I'll probably bore you all.\nIn the other fields, I think the music and plot do a decent job at what they need to do. (Granted, the plot here isn't the greatest, but it's RE - when were they ever realistic?)\nI think overall, while this game didn't scare me as much as the early REs did, it does manage to stay true to its roots and give a great survival horror experience.","October 16, 2014","true","333.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I got this game when it was on sale for $13, but after seeing all the content the game offers, I'd say the game is worth the full price cost. The only downside is the lack of players; I have yet to find a joinable match online. So if your considering getting this game, I would recommend convincing one friend to get the game as well.

I almost regret it that I did not bought it earlier.\n\nI do not know how much I can actually write about the game without spoiling it at least a little bit so be aware of it. You have been warned.\n\nCapcom tried to get back to the roots with this game after the more action based Resident Evil 5 and 6.\n\nTherefore you will encounter a lot less of the "Call of Duty" feeling where you have to shoot your way through the levels. In addition to that there are no real quick time events either. However, there are some little passages within the game where you have to shoot your way through the monsters. Thankfully, these passages are rather short and do not ruin the game to much.\n\nYou play the game mainly as Jill Valentine who was sent out with her partner Parker Luciani to find Chris Redfield. Even though the main character is Jill you will have to play some different characters as well. The story might be confusing at first sight, because there are some jumps here and there, but it will all make sense in the end.\n\nThe biggest part of the game plays on a ship, which is huge by the way. During your progress you will unlock new rooms and areas of the ship and some of them are really pretty. You will need to backtrack a couple of times to get new keys etc. to open new areas so a good memory or good map reading skills are recommended otherwise you will run in circles =)\nThere are even some riddles in the game, but sadly they are not really worth mentioning. Oh I almost forgot about the "shock moments". Some of them really catched me off guard. I really recommend to play this game with lights out in the evening, preferably with a good headset.\n\nI did my first playthrough on the normal difficulty and in comparison to Resident Evil 5 and 6 I actually managed to run out of ammo sometimes so do not waste you bullets. I can only imagine how brutal the hardest difficulty must be which I will definitely try to beat. By the way the last boss of the game really deserves to be called "boss". Personaly, I think it was one of the most hardest bossfights in my Resident Evil history. Maybe because I did not upgrade my weapons or did not use a rocket launcher (easy mode). Believe me you will be so much satisfied after you beat him words just cannot describe it. Dark Souls is a piece of cake in comparison, really it is.\n\nI needed 12h more or less for my first playthrough, but I was really trying to look at every corner and soak up the atmosphere of the game. I guess you can finish it in 8-9h if you rush through it.\n\nI do not know what else to say.\n\nBuy it, play it, love it.\n\n\n\n\n\n","June 29, 2014","true","14.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Raid mode makes it a game you can pick up and kill some time on any time you really want to, but because of raid mode you'll want to finish the story just to unlock more levels of raid mode. This is not to say the story is bad in any way, as many new characters such as Grinder and Jackass are interesting and funny characters that could easily be desearving of their own game. However Raid mode is a huge selling point. A good amount of the time you'll invest may be in finding your perfect gun, or the fastest route through a map or just trying to beat an old score.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/klarden/recommended/222480/","klarden","Kain Klarden","http://steamcommunity.com/id/klarden/","1232 products in account","Revelations is a rather interesting part of the Resident Evil series. On one hand, it does feel like a side-story, not part of the main series. On the other, it often plays more like what Resident Evil used to be, than the newest entries. It feels like a more focused and better put together game, than Resident Evil 6 (released same year). But at the same time, doesn't evoke the same feelings, RE6 does, feels like designers lacked confidence and built the game by the checklist, not by their inner desires.\nBasic gameplay and the main parts of the game are really well done. Controls and some of the principles feel almost a perfect fit for a potential remake of the classic RE games, both in a more survival horror auto-aim style, and survival action over the shoulder more action style. Stuff no longer falls from enemies (escept for rare cases of mini-boss encounters, most of which can be skipped), ammo is rather scarce, running away is very often a very viable and even preferable option. Many locations are very narrow, but there is a rather well implemented dodge move, which is quite important to master. There's more freedom of exploration and good old "hey I found a key, let's open the door from before" moments, than even in Resident Evil 4. Although, it never quite truly tries to go full RE0-CV in terms of allowing you to roam free, since game is divided into chapters and quite a lot of them limit your options by some story reasons.\nHowever, there's a bigger issue with chapters. Sadly, despite the main part of the game being good and very classic RE-like most of the time, developers constantly shoehorn boring, repetitive and action heavy chapters from other characters perspectives into the flow of the game. Those tend to reuse areas from before, don't use the same weapon/herb/weapon upgrade setup as the main game and are, ultimately, completely disposable except for several key moment, which could've been done as non interactive cutscenes and nothing of value would've been lost. Part of the reason behind their existance is probably due to Capcom's fear, that game will sell less if there's not enough action in it.\nAnd another part is due to the silly story the game has. Now, Resident Evil games always had silly stories, but they tend to be awesomely silly, when you know that events you're watching unfold are dumb, all the characters are quite over the top, but it's so awesome you can't help but love it. And, besides, there was always a layer of seriousness in the story, which made for a good contrast with all the silliness. RE6 is that. Revalations is not. It's just plain stupid, always trying to look smart with all the plot twists and out of order side-chapter releals. But at the end of the day, it's just all dumb, full of new characters with crazy outfits and hairstyles, whom we will never ever see again, most likely, apart from the main duo of Chris and Jill and one small character, who had minor appearence in RE5. Also, Parker is quite clearly the result of developers wanting to have Barry Burton but not being able to for story reasons. And also, Jill is rather weirdly redesigned and looks a bit creepy.\nCreepy mostly due to the fact, that this game wasn't vastly visually improved over the 3DS version, so facial animations are crap, and many models and textures are rather "meh". Game still looks quite good, but there's a huge difference between it and RE6 even in how dynamic enemies' reactions to being shot are in RE6, and how boring shooting enemies in Revelations is. It doesn't detract much enjoyment from the game, but is rather noticeable.\nThere's also an interesting bonus mode, called Raid mode. Unlike RE4-style Mercenaries (which I could never get into, to be honest), it plays much more like Mercenaries: Operation Mad Jackal from RE3 or The 4th Survivor from RE2. There's no time limit (but time affects your rating), you don't *have* to kill every enemy, and the main point is getting to a specific place on the map. But along the way you can (and sometimes have to) kill enemies, potentially find ammo, upgrades and new weapons. It's a really fun mode that can be played solo or co-op. It has one big issue, though, which ties with the fact, that the game was designed to be portable. In a "gotta catch 'em all" way, there's a lot of stuff to get, get leveled up and such, but it's very grindy in nature, meant to be played in short bursts and gets quite repetitive fast otherwise. Hence, on a portable device it's a definitely more fun mode to play, than on a PC or console.\nOverall, a really solid game, with nice return to the oldschool ideals for most of the time, and disposable annoying sequences inserted inbetween the enjoyable main game.","April 1, 2014","true","34.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But, hey, they thankfully proved me wrong with a game that was originally a 3DS spin off. With Revelations, the series once again gains survival horror like settings, atmosphere, and mechanics while still maintaining all the improvements made with the controls.\n\nFor the older fans: You'll get a decent amount of survival horror atmosphere, along with the ammo conservation mechanics. It's nowhere near the golden days of Resident Evil 1-CV but it's leagues above the stuff they pulled with Resident Evil 5. Heck, it's a start in the right direction right? The story as well actually feels like a throwback to the earlier games with a lot of chess moves going on in the background and you the player trying to figure out the mystery before the game reveals it. Of course most importantly, they brought the item chest back. I only serves to hold extra fire arms in this game but having inventory management in a RE game after such a long time, was a nice surprise.\n\nFor the newer fans: All the great things about Resident Evil 4's controls are still there, ammo isn't limited enough that you can't go on a small shooting spree on normal or lower difficulty, and action sequences are sprinkled through the entire game. So if you like the action side more of the franchise, you can have fun with Revelations with the understanding it's not 4 or 5 in terms of shooting everything that comes at you.\n\nTo wrap this up, this is a great game compared to the junk Capcom has released in the RE franchise these couple of years. Good story, exploration, running from enemies, good narrative, and interesting enemy designs(though they get repetitive after a while.) I hope Capcom lets the team behind this game continue to do their own thing of bringing back the series closer to its original form because fans will response to that with purchases. Meanwhile, Capcom can use the main series to continue to try and force a square peg in a round hole with their "No, no, it's not a rip-off of Call of Duty. It's action survival, trust us." With the magic that was Resident Evil 6, I'm sure that's working beautifully for them.\n","December 29, 2014","true","62.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The controls are really good, and they aren't like the action controls for RE6.  The menu's had a little bit of trouble.  It's kind of weird how you select the weapons and eveything is blue so it can be hard to select a gun quickly.  They work, but I would prefer the type of menu from RE4 or even 5 over this one.\n\nThe story is over the top and fun just like most RE games.  There's a conspiricy theory, and a bunch of destruction and blood, so if you've played the other resident evil games this is more of the same.  One thing I really like about the story is the setting.  The majority of the game takes place on an old abandoned cruise ship.  The location reminds me of the mantion from resident evil 1 and is very creepy.  Even though the game isn't super scary, it is a lot more scary than the newer ones.  I would rank the scares in this game somewhere between resident evil 4 and 5.\n\nThe game ran really well for me and does not have super high system requirements.  I did have trouble getting the game to run in 1366 × 768 resolution for some reason.  I don't knonw if that has been changed yet, but I found it odd that I couldn't get the game to run in the resolution I wanted.  I ended up playing the game with a black border around my screen which was annoying.  I'm sure I could have messed around with it or found some sort of fix, but I wasn't really in the mood to do that when I played the game.  So just know you might have to look for a fix online if you want certain resolutions.\n\nAll in all I would recommend this game.  It is a turn back to the older games and even though it isn't that scary, it offers a couple scares for horror fans like me.  I would recommend you get this game if you really liked RE4 or even RE1 because of the setting.  They are releasing a sequel soon, and I hope that they build on this success to make a classic RE experience.","January 3, 2015","true","10.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Gameplay: 7/10\nRE4 set the de facto standard with "over-the-shoulder" 3rd person action and I have no problems with it.\nI used the keyboard and mouse setup - whole reason why I bought the PC version.\nCamera can be a bit wonky at times but for 97-99% of the time I had no problems.\nDifficulty wise, definitely harder than RE4 and RE5 (from what I remembered on Gamecube and PS3 anyway); Boss fights are challenging enough to require expending nearly all your ammunitions and proper aiming (no EZ rocket for you! RE4 boss fights haha...).\nAlso, no weapon can become "overpowered" in the sense they can't be upgraded beyond what the weapon mods allow for.\nFrom what I can tell, the DLC weapons offer no significant advantage over what is available in the stock game.\n\n2. Duration/replayability 4/10\nOK, I may have rushed it a bit, (I actually completely missed the magnum pickup in episode 7 and only bothered to look it up online after completing the game).\nIt may also have to do with the game design (Raid mode doesn't do anything for single player; Capcom trying to squeeze EVERYONE's story in 10 hours).\n\n3. "Story": 3/10\nSeriously, I hated the constant switching of characters in each episode (WTF, can't we just pick a character, follow-through on their one story and replay the game from another character's view?)\nRE4 had the right idea - main campaign with Leon, separate ways with Ada.\nTo Capcom and other players, if you want another perspective from another character? That should be considered DLC material right there and I have no problems with it as long as its of good quality.\nThe story is also full of cliches, but its the RE series, I don't expect an Epic.\n\n*New* Raid mode: 7/10\nThe RNG loot mode. I suppose its a decent grinder; 5-20 minutes on each stage (around 30 total) looking for random loots with map levels based on the campaign.\nBonus weapons in raid mode are available from time to time from residentevil.net apparently (most have expired already however...)\nOnline co-op has not been working for me.\n\nOverall 6/10 (Edited):\nI bought this game for 15$ on sale with all of its included DLCs and I feel that is about the right value from my experience. Other players may differ in opinion, but I felt RE4/5 were worth their full retail price (40~50$) at release compared to this entry.\nRumors hold that Revelations  2 is to be an episodic release... I will be holding onto my credit card and be waiting for the completed edition; and I will be waiting for actual players experience feedback before purchasing.\n\nEdit: This review was edited after going through raid mode.

Great character design and shapes, especially on Jill and Rachel, and particular bosses.\n\nA lot of weapons and customization, character and weapon unlockables. Story is poor, like any other zombie game, there's outbreak, infection, bla-bla, we have to kill stuff and save earth. But what's important is the killing of things that are dead, because you don't really kill anything, because they are dead.\n\nIn this one you will mostly be on your own, in single player that is, usually you and your partner will be separated and occasionally meet up. In co-op mode however you play stages from selection of single player levels together with your friend, to clear the stage and not die. It's fun and may get boring after a while, like any repeatable thing, unless it's sex... well if you do 10-20 sexruns each day, you might get exhausted and also bored eventually. But don't get your hopes up that high, because there's rarely anyone that does that. Enjoy.","August 15, 2015","true","61.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, the lack of CO-OP campaign as promised before release was a huge disappointment having your 2nd partner being simply and useless NPC that literally does no damage or anything beyond, just following you.\n\nAlso with this game comes the fimilar Raid Mode, though fun for hours eventually you will reach max level. At this point the Raid Mode takes a terrible dive in the fact at max level there are only 2-3 maps worth playing for any kind of progrerssion upgrades. This leads to a boring grind fest, doing the same waves, of the same spawn, in the same rooms, over and over.\n\nDue to the new flavor the game as offered over Raccoon City and RE6 I'd give this game a 7/10 and is worth playing.","December 5, 2015","true","96.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/222480/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","975 products in account","Quick Summary: Third person action shooter very similar to Resident Evil 5, but at times noticeably lower graphics and some actual downgrades in gameplay mechanics. This is likely due to the fact that Revelations is a port of a Nintendo hand held game, later upgraded with HD graphics, and was never meant to be the next “great” Resident Evil game. Still, it’s fun and time consuming so you’ll get your money’s worth even if you didn’t buy the various DLCs.\n\nDespite the fact that Revelations was released a few years after Resident Evil 5, the story of Revelations actually takes place earlier, as a kind of prequel (though unrelated plot-wise). You play BSAA agent Jill Valentine for the most part, but in each chapter you’ll regularly control different people such as Chris Redfield or other BSAA agents.  You know Jill is the main character though since she’s the only one who can mod her weapons with upgrade kits, and swap guns at the various loadout crates scattered around the area. Jill and her partner Parker are on a mission exploring an abandoned cruise ship related to terrorist activity from years before. As usual in Resident Evil games, “terrorist” means bio-weapons that create monsters to be unleashed on the world. This time around the weapon in question is the T-Abyss virus, that doesn’t make traditional zombies, but instead makes “oozes” which look kind of like humanoid tubeworms with claws and spiky teeth. Of course, that’s just the weak stuff. There are a bunch of giant bosses and super creepy monsters wandering the cruise ship as well.\n\nIf you’ve played Resident Evil 5, the gameplay should be very familiar to you, except that now you can just press the mouse button for a quick jab attack. Just like in RE 5 though, regular melee isn’t much use except for breaking boxes in the campaign (it’s more useful in Raid mode). You still have special contextual power hits that do a lot of damage to stunned enemies, but it’s a lot harder to set up stuns in Revelations. To kill most enemies you’ll have to rely on your guns. Various guns are found throughout the game (you can’t buy them in campaign) and they can only be upgraded with weapon “parts” that you find lying around. For example, your basic pistol may have 3 upgrade slots so you can add up to 3 weapon upgrades like + damage, faster shooting, and larger magazine, and swap for better ones that you find later. There’s no “money” used in the campaign for buying upgrades. Also note that even though you are usually with a partner throughout the campaign, this is not a co-op game. You cannot go through the story with a friend.\n\nAnother new feature for Revelations is the Genesis device, which is just a scanner despite its fancy name. You can quickly switch to the scanner at almost any time to scan enemies (alive or dead) and it adds a % to your “data.” For example scanning an ooze could give you 10% and scanning a tougher enemy might give you 20%. Every time you reach 100%, you get a healing herb added to your inventory, and the % resets to 0. It’s a slow but steady way to gain herbs at various points in the game. The Genesis can also be used to locate hidden items (like ammo or herbs) lying invisible on the ground.\n\nPros:\n+A spooky Resident Evil game with enemies more gruesome than zombies, and no “human” enemies so you don’t need to hide from enemy gunfire (though there are some ranged oozes). There is a lot of backtracking in this game, and you’re going to go through most areas of the cruise ship several times. This means you have opportunities to pick up things that you missed the previous times through.\n+The story is compelling, but it’s episodic which means every chapter starts with a “previously on Resident Evil Revelations” cutscene to catch you up in case you didn’t buy every episode.\n+The Raid mode is the highlight of the game and allows you and a partner to level up by playing through areas from the game’s campaign. You also acquire BP (kind of like money) that you can use to buy weapons and weapon upgrade parts. You’ll need to get new gear when you level up because weapons have fixed levels. For example you start at level 1 with a level 1 gun, but when you’ve advanced, you may want to buy a level 2 gun, etc.\n\nCons:\n-Since this is a mobile game port, the graphics and handling isn’t quite up to snuff compared to Resident Evil 5 or 6. There’s some frame rate stuttering on my computer (which ran RE 5 smoothly), and like Resident Evil 6, every time you start the game there are half a dozen little load screens to wait through.\n-The game’s co-op Raid mode doesn’t have that many people playing anymore apparently. This may be because you can’t “drop in” to someone’s game. The host has to set up a game and wait for people to join, sometimes for a long time if nobody is searching for a match that very second. Most people probably don’t have the patience for that. This means if you want to play co-op, you need to set it up with a friend beforehand. Also, like RE 5, there’s no text or voice chat in the co-op.\n\nOverall, the game is a fun continuation of the action shooter style of Resident Evil games, and the creepy deserted cruise ship has a nice atmosphere for horror. Raid mode will occupy a lot of your time after you’ve finished the story. Once you’ve mastered Raid mode’s Abyss tier of levels, the campaign’s Infernal difficulty (hard mode) will seem like a walk in the park.","March 29","true","106.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/solaris32/recommended/222480/","solaris32","solaris32","http://steamcommunity.com/id/solaris32/","2004 products in account","As a huge fan of RE4 and even RE5, I really enjoyed this 3DS port. What I enjoyed of the previous games was the over the shoulder camera and having to watch your ammo while you fight monsters. There are many differences of course, good but not necessarily better, though certainly not worse.\n\nGENERAL INFO\nIf you've played RE4/5 you'll know generally what to expect here, if not check out screenshots and videos for this game. The vast majority of the game takes place on a large cruise ship. During the course of the game you will explore it and find keys that unlock more of the ship to progress the story. Every once in a while the game will switch to a different duo and play as them for a little while with preset weapons. Not my favorite parts but they do help break up the monotony of the ship and explain more of the story.\n\nGUNS\nWhere the game shines are the weapons and upgrades. You can have any 3 weapons equipped, even 3 pistols if you wanted though that's stupid. There are pistols, shotguns, smgs/assault rifles, long range rifles, and magnums. For each weapon type there are different guns you will find with differing stats. When you find a gun and take it back to your storage box thing you will have it forever (the gun you dropped is returned too). This is how you switch out your guns and change their upgrades, you can't do it anywhere for obvious balance reasons. Upgrading guns is a lot of fun. Each gun has anywhere from 1 to 5 slots for upgrades, and you can apply upgrades and take them off at will. Upgrades include the standard fare of higher damage, higher bullet capacity, faster reload, etc. and many more unique ones.\n\nYOUR AI PARTNER\nBy far the biggest advantage this game has, especially over RE5, is that although you have an AI partner he can safely be ignored. In RE5 even if you were playing solo, you still had to manage your AI partners inventory and keep them alive, but thankfully they were generally fairly smart though still a hassle. Here your AI partner is invincible, the enemies pretty much always push past him to come after you, and while your partner can shoot they rarely seem to. Are they useless? Yes. Do they stay out of your way and present no hassle for you and let you enjoy the single player experience you want? Thank goodness yes! Of course you can play co-op if you wanted, but it's far from forced.\n\nPLAYTHROUGH INFO\nYour first playthrough on normal if you are reasonably thorough and don't try to rush it will take you about 8-10 hours. Like in RE4 there is a new game+ mode where you keep all your weapons and ammo from before and start over. That's already fun, but this game has an infernal difficulty which you can, and are probably expected to, play on a new game+. This mode features a lot more enemies, enemies in different places than normal, and even enemies early on you wouldn't normally see until later in the game. Furthermore, items are in different places and nothing at all like on normal. Infernal mode is practically a whole new game!\n\nRAID MODE\nAs if all this wasn't awesome enough there's this RPG-progression-like mode called Raid Mode. In it you do a quick mission where your goal is to find the exit. There are many of these missions, and as you do them you gain experience which allows you to level up. The higher level missions will let you find higher level weapons, of which you need to be the appropriate level to wield. The weapons will have increased stats and effects, very similar to Borderlands random gun drops. You can prepare for each mission using what you've earned/bought. Yes there is a store which resets every time you enter it. You can easily spend dozens of hours on this mode alone. This mode can also be played in co-op if you wish.\n\nCONCLUSION\nIf you liked RE4/5 definitely check this game out, you aren't likely to be disappointed. If you've never played them before take a look at some lets plays for a good idea.\nP.S.

And yet I can't help but enjoy this game. It's a fantastic return to the horror roots of the series. The raid mode is somewhat decent and can be pretty enjoyable with friends. And the game is actually really well paced. It doesn't touch RE4 (which IMO has had the perfect gameplay pacing I've ever seen) but it's definetly the best game to come out in a while. This game remembers an olden time where you didn't have a co-op partner with you for the entire game. And it recalls the days when you actually had to aim and be careful with ammo. The upgrades you find while playing are incredibley helpful and well worth looking for (♥♥♥♥ RE6's perks). I don't quite have enough room to go on about all the right things this game did, but it's easily one of the best releases in the franchise. There are a few parts that even scared me, which is more than I can say for RE5/6. I bought this game on the 3ds and enjoyed it enough to swap it towards the PC release. This is the best Steam Resident Evil game for sure. The controls are a bit off with KB+M but it's tolerable. I'd say the game is good enough to be above being looked over for bad porting.  8.8/10.","July 7, 2013","true","21.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you've never played a Resident Evil I recommend the HD remake of the original to Resilations.\n\nAs a Resident Evil game it fits somewhere in between Code Veronica and RE4 in terms of the horror/action/hilariously convoluted storytelling ratio. It does a good job of making itself feel like it's more challenging and is putting you in more danger than it really is and the Queen Zenobia is a pretty good location to set the game in. The early moments where the game lets the atmospheric groan of the empty ship surround you as the screen shifts every so slightly to the rhythm of the ocean are the most unnerving parts of the game. Eventually it becomes obvious that ammo and health is pretty plentiful and you're feel too well equipped by the end of the game for it to be scary or even more than a little tense.\n\nIt's pretty obvious that this is a port from the 3DS. While very impressive on that piece of hardware even an HD facelife doesn't keep it from looking dated, even the cutscenes have a stange grainy/poorly compressed look to them. It's also still apparent that it was meant to be played in small chunks. The game is split into little episodes that usually run roughly 45 minutes and end on a big cliff hanger (which usually resolves in the silliest way possible) it was obviously designed around playing on a commute or lunch hour. It even plays a little "last time on Resilations" recap before each episode like it's assuming you're not going to play the game for long periods. Playing it sporadically probably helped hide some of the games issues with backtracking. At one point you escape a flooded area and the the next episode you just dive back in and swim though it all over again.\n\nThe best parts of the game revolve around Jill Valentine investigating the Queen Zenobia, but you're constantly being pulled from that storyline the plotlines of other characters and when you're back to Jill you end up backtracking a decent amount meaning that, in an already short game, you just don't get enough of the best parts. Tht being said Resilations is overall a solid games and is still a good game even when you're not in the Jill Valentine segments. The RE4 style mechanincs for fighting are fun even if Resilations doesn't have that game's excellent level design to play around with it in. Raid mode adds some life to the short campaign although your milage may vary with it.","June 27, 2015","true","12.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

The new limited ammo and new upgrade system help stop the game from becoming the gunfest of the previous titles, but what I felt hurt the game was the removal of the context sensitive melee attacks for head and knee shots, which in previous titles made combat feel far more fluid. Instead, Revelations arms the player with a one-button knife attack, which allows for some cheap kills.\nThe excellent new Raid mode is the replacement to previous title's Mercenary mode. Gone is the time limit that crippled the previous version; instead we get to maintain a constant inventory and level up.

I've played Free to play mmos with less grind than this, horribly slow level system that serves purely as a gate, a grind you must get through just to be "this tall to ride" the next grind which is grinding to get weapons and custom parts.  Unless someone boosts you raid will take stupidly long to get anywhere, and still terribly long even with a boost. On top of this fact that the two early teirs; Chasm and Trench, may as well not even exist as you get nothing substantial from it. Raid doesn't even "begin" till abyss cause thats when you start to get your more perfect weapons and custom parts that actually can change gameplay styles. so imagine suffering through 30 levels or so and roughly around 5 hours to even get to abyss and thats if you got a partner and think if that sounds fun.\noverall 2/10\n\nI still recommend the game for the campaign only really.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/snowpaw/recommended/222480/","snowpaw","Theresa Barkskin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/snowpaw/","343 products in account","Revelations is a welcome addition to the Resident Evil franchise. It attempts to go back to its survival horror roots with a tense atmosphere and semi-tank controls. Revelations does not disappoint in that aspect as there are several moments where you do not expect what will be around the corner waiting for you. It really is no secret that Capcom wants to take the franchise into the action/third-person style; and Revelations still has aspects of this as well. It may not be as bad as other Resident Evil games but the game is still quite enjoyable. With the introduction of Revelations comes the Genesis, a device used to show hidden items through-out the environment.\n\nThe Genesis adds an interesting layer to the gameplay. The main purpose of the Genesis is to gain additional ammo and herbs. Of course you can also use the Genesis to scan B.O.W.s., whether alive or dead, to gain more herbs with every 100% completion. There are very few healing items in the open world so it is highly advised you use the Genesis as much as possible. Overall the Genesis is an interesting addition to a Resident Evil game but in the end it shows that the game really was made with a handheld in mind.\n\nA few gripes with the game is that the story telling isn’t the best. You are constantly switching back and forth between several people and this tends to mud up the flow of the timeline within the game. Another annoyance is the lack of healing items. There will be quite a few times you run out of them, as you can only carry five, and you only gain a small percentage from scanning monsters. The game also tends to hold your hand when you die, basically telling you what you did wrong and how to overcome it. I wish Capcom didn’t do and let the player figure it out like the past games.\n\nIn conclusion Revelations is a must have for any fans of the classic Resident Evil series. It takes a step back to recreate the tense setting and tries to instill fear into the player like the games of old with a few new twists on the gameplay.\n\nOverall I give the game a 7 out of 10.","January 3, 2014","true","12.3"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

Though it is a HD port of a handheld game so its not deep in regards to systems or content but I've played through twice as of writing this and its still a very nice fun little game.  Graphics are held back a bit by its handheld origins but the art direction helps get around that and the animation is superb while the story stuff is the usual super dumb but lovable capcom experience.  Definitely a must play for series fans.\n\nControls are fantastic for both mouse n gamepad, no bugs or weird glitches, the port overall seems very well done.","December 6, 2014","true","10.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Now, let's dig into the game:\n\nIt's pretty much a 'classic' resident evil when you play as Jill with all the improvements of aiming and moving. I must clarify AS JILL because when you play as any other character the game is garbage. Seriously. In Resident Evil 4 and previous games, you spent a lot of time wandering around, collecting keys, and solving puzzles. All of that only happens as Jill while playing as other characters is basically go there, shoot that, and get bored from the truely horrifying bad story.\n\nLet's put more emphasis on the fact that the story is the only scary thing about this game. It's bad. Very bad. How bad? It has 'Revelations' as a tagline which suggests a twist in the story! This twist is predictable and EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER acts they are from a senior high drama class. I would say something about them being on drugs, but drugs would have improved the story, dialog, and characters.\n\nIt took me about 5 hours to beat this game, and only 3~3.5 of it was with Jill. I didn't try Raid mode because who gives a ♥♥♥♥.","August 15, 2013","true","7.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The only reason might be to S rank the remaining campaign chapters I haven’t done yet or to unlock even more achievments in the free online portal found on residentevil.net. So here we begin this in two sections separated review. First we sink into the campaign mode before we head on to the action packed Raid Mode.\n\nCampaign\nPeople will tell you that Revelations was the first step of Capcom to bring the series back to its survival horror roots but I can’t completely agree with that. The campaign is split into 12 chapters. The majority of chapters take place on a cruise ship while others are more of the typical action shooter the series is known for today with various changing locations and time periods. The cruise ship chapters feature narrow corridors, somewhat creepy atmosphere and are surprising the best chapters of the game while the action oriented chapters are mediocre at best compared to other action shooter games out there.\n\nThe storyline is one gigantic puzzle jumping back & forth between events and can be very confusing the first time around. But it’s not as convoluted as they say. It’s easy to differentiate who are the bad guys & good guys in this soap opera. To put the pieces together can be a very entertaining & is a motivator to continue playing until the end.\n\nYou run around mostly solo and if a partner is on your toes then it’s only an AI controlled partner. Unlike other entries the AI partner in Revelations doesn’t need to be instructed because he/she is basically invincible, got infinite ammo and shoots or doges when the need to shoot or dodge is required. The player is the true source of power in the roughly 11hour campaign here. He/she is is the one to deal the damage & the one that needs to heal himself.\n\nGameplay mechanics are very simple. This is after all a 3DS game ported & remastered for PC. Healing, throwing grenades, using the knife are bound to only a button and can be executed quick without much time of preparation which is a good thing compared to the clunky, overloaded mechanics used in other entries of the series. The only game mechanic that is poorly implemented is the Dodging-System. You basically have to push the action button & the analog stick short before an enemy hits you. But this button is bound to other actions like opening doors, shooting with the gun & picking up items and doesn’t work most of the time and requires lots of practice to be used to its fully extend.\n\nRaid Mode\n\nFirst introduced in Revelations 1 is the so called Raid Mode. This mode spawns three difficulties with 20 stages that must be unlocked as you play along. Raid is basically an Arcade Shooter in which you will be throw in all the locations of campaign mode and to solve tasks like killing all enemies or reaching the goal. Enemy spawns are fixed so they can be learned easily. You either play it alone or you invite one of your Steam Friends or search for strangers to play it in Co-Op.\n\nAfter each stage you will be rated on accuracy, enemies routed & damage taken and earns you XP that level up your characters. Perfect players will be awarded with bonuses for no damage taken, elimination of all enemies and completing a stage at the recommended level. This results in higher currency which then can be used to buy new weapons and weapon upgrades in the in game shop.\n\nLeveling up will raise the level of all characters. Characters are mere avatars with different skill sets. Some are good with SMGs, while others are better in using Shotguns, to take less damage or to dodge easier.\n\nThe only negative I have to write about Raid Mode is the lack of stages & the sheer amount of time investment to reach a new player level. Leveling up is so freaking slow that you replay some stages 10 or more times before you are able to survive in the next. Playing stages below recommented level & with an online partner is the key for faster level up, but it is a tedious process that gets you bored very quickly.\n\nConclusion\n\nRevelations 1 is a fun little action shooter with horror elements that got so much to offer that you will be entertained for hours. Fans of the series should buy it without giving it a second thought. Achievement Hunters as well as casual gamers should think twice before they hit the purchase button, unless they are willing to spend time on the good but not perfect Raid Mode.","April 21, 2015","true","69.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's not as scary as dead space or resident evil 2 but it makes up for it with great gameplay mechanics. It's an incredibly well done console port - both movement and mouse aiming are tight and responsive.\n\nMy only complaints are that the coop mode isn't fully integrated (no campaign coop mode), it's a separate arcade style series of missions. Disappointing because you have an AI partner with you for a large portion of the campaign, woulndn't have been difficult to implement. I don't care much for the approach capcom took in trying to develop the story with this game. It basically creates a bunch of 'episode' segments, the majority of them you play as Jill but some of them toss you into alternate character side missions that really don't contribute much to the game.\n\nAlso, the game is a little too easy. Even playing on infernal mode with a brand new game I didn't have to worry about ammo management after 2 or 3 chapters (Although the first chapter is pretty tricky). If you have good aim this won't be terribly challenging for you.\n\nTL;DR  - Pros: Great gameplay and controls; Jill has a nice ♥♥♥\nCons: No campaign coop mode; Too many side character missions; Kinda easy on max difficulty\n","December 28, 2013","true","29.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This series is what got me into gaming as a kid, I could play for hours, but this... this is just awful. It's a game made for the masses of action genre "gamers" that can't think for themselves, just to follow a generic set path, no real puzzles and no real exploration - and it's not even a good action game at that.\n\nThe story was boring, the graphics weren't even that great, there's still no Resident Evil feel to it, apart from the fact it has Chris and Jill in it.\n\nWhat annoys me as well is you don't even care if your character dies like in the old Resi games. There's nothing to lose apart from the fact you have to maybe redo the last couple minutes of the game. And not having that risk factor just takes a massive element of the game out of it.\n\nThe only thing that made this feel like a Resi game was the bad voice acting, but it's not even funny bad, it's just... bad.\n\nThey need to go back to the old format of Resident Evil, none of this over the shoulder ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, bring back the safe rooms, decent puzzles, and just stop taking the virus too far as well.

Ring any ♥♥♥♥ing bells yet? It should, because that exact same thing was done years ago, and it was called Silent Hill 2 and was actually good. Too bad Crapcom can't make good games without ripping off people who know what they're doing. Anyway, Cris gets a letter from Jane Valentine (Is she supposed to be related to Vincent Valentine from Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children? Get REAL, Crapcock.) and has to find her on a boat. But he can't ♥♥♥♥ing find her. How hard is it to find a boat, Cris? IT'S AN OCEAN. THERE IS LITERALLY NOTHING IN IT BUT BOATS. So you have to play as Jane, and you have to spend all your ♥♥♥♥ing time looking at people with your Fisher Price Monster Scanner kit, to figure out if they're monsters or not. Meanwhile Cris is suddenly on a ♥♥♥♥ing MOUNTAIN? What. There are no ♥♥♥♥ing boats on a mountain, you prick. Crap♥♥♥♥ is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ developer who can not even REMEMBER what it happening IN THEIR OWN GAMES. It just gets worse from there. Really, it would be a lot better if this wasn't such a HUGE Silent Hill ripoff, except set on a boat. And don't even get me started on the Raid Mode, which is pretty much all the worst elements from World of Warcraft, slapped into a half-baked ♥♥♥♥♥♥ grind marathon.\n\nSCORES:\nGraphics: 6/10. This used to be a Game Boy Advance game, and you can tell. However, one chick gets horribly and painfully turned into a terrible monster and begs you to kill her, except she has her ♥♥♥♥ out the entire time, and it's pretty clear that the devs were literally masturbating while designing their ♥♥♥♥♥ Zombie. So it gets points for zombie ♥♥♥♥.\nMusic: 3/10. The game does not have music.\nGameplay: 7/10. You point the Scan Man 3000 at a zombie, and a little bar fills up and you get a herb. Then I guess you smoke that herb or something. Since the game is 420 friendly it gets bonus points.\nStory: 5/10. Again, Silent Hill did it better.\n\nFINAL SCORE: B-\n\nYOU MIGHT ENJOY THIS GAME IF...\nYou get crazy boners from bloody zombie ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.","November 27, 2013","true","23.6"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","10","20","0","0"

Though, of course, this game isn't without problems:\n\nThe graphics are ok at best, though that's likely because it was originally on the 3DS. Also, while certain new characters like Parker and Raymond are great, others like Jessica, Quint, and Keith are... not so much. Playing the game on Normal, ammo is abundant, so a harder difficulty is recommended if you want to feel more of an actual challenge.  Lastly, the final boss is about 50/50 when it comes to enjoyability. To me, it was frustrating until I figured out its pattern, which didn't take too long.\n\nOverall, not my favorite Resident Evil, but still an enjoyable one for sure.

I have to say that I was incredibly dissapointed in it (though I suppose no more than in say, RE6), and I honestly cannot recommend this game to anyone, not even fans of the franchise. I know this is a port from a handheld, so I suppose there is no point in complaining about graphics, however, the game is really really short (the entire campaign takes under 6 hours), you are being thrown from character to character, from location to location and it is disorienting, makes it difficult to manage your items or anticipate what you might need, and some of the characters you have to control are absolutely atrociously written. Speaking of writing, it is rather convoluted, even for a Resident Evil game. The fact that you will play through flashback sequences presented without much rhyme or reason is not helping. The voice - acting is almost as bad as RE 1 times, but this time there is no excuse of being a pioneering game. Overall it is tedious, often boring, unrewarding awful game with clunky controls. Do yourself a favour and buy the RE 1 HD Remaster or RE 4 HD instead.\n\nBonus: There are two characters supposedly provided as comic relief that boils down to saying "THIS BLOWS". All. The.

Your "partner" doesnt do anything and just pretends to shoot at the enemies when they dont actully do anything to them. Some enemies have a stupid amount of health and you are forced to use the scanner thingy to find ammo/herb (there is only one herb type) because if you dont then you get to a ponit where the game forces you to use melee and melee suck big-time because it does nothing except get you hit. The story is full of holes too and I think I read better stories off public toilet walls that make more sense than this. I had to go into game files to get the game to start up first time because it started up in the incorrect format for me and left me with a blank screen. Also the last boss is just the stupidest thing ever, I wont mention any spoilers but You enter a room, thsi guy who thinks you are the enemy starts mumbling abotu how he hates his enemy(who he thinks you work for) and gives you what you want...by accident? Then you walk off with the item and he tells you to wait so naturally you watch him mutate himself (even though he already did it before but whatever because ♥♥♥♥ logic) Then insted of just walking away, The charcters then decide to explain they are not the enemies even though the guy has already mutated himself.  Jill's quote" Its useless, hes gone mad" No ♥♥♥♥ sherlock, maybe you should of told him before he injected himself with aids virus. So then you wait for the boss to teleport to you so you can wait then shoot its heart with only a 0.5 second reaction time to look around, aim and shoot enough bullets. Dont bother trying to dodge it, dodging in this game is dumb and the game thinks you are trying to do a 180 turn most of the time. But nayway you cant dodge it and it doesnt matter if you are anywhere near him because its scripted that you get hurt.....yeah thats also ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Oh yeah, then it get to the ponit where you have to look at 2 of them and decide which one is the real one but even then you have to wit until jsut before his swing hits the ground because only then it shows who to shoot.....trust me its a massive facepalm of a game at this point. YOu jsut keep shooting at him for hours. The door isnt even locked but you cant get out just because this guy told you to "wait" so naturally you have to wait and get stab to dead by him while Chris stands in the corner of the room shooting him with a Nerf gun like he always does (he doesnt do anything and has no purpose, just like all the co-op AI in this game). But like I said, some parts of this game are fun but when you run into the many ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t moments then you get a really bad taste in your mouth because of this game.","July 5, 2014","false","15.1"," 13 of 27 people (48%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","48","13","27","2","0"

Trying to give this another go after failing to peak my interest the first time, I couldn't do it. I have problems sleeping, unless I play this game. This game is so mind numbingly boring that it makes me sleepy. Running from room to room gunning down the same types of monsters gets obviously repetitive and the game has absolutely no scare factor. I've played every single Resident Evil game I can think of, and I even like the terrible first person Resident Evil more than this back in the day of the first Playstation. The only thing horrific about this game is that it is an abomination to the Resident Evil classic feel. Those that claim it has that feeling must be delusional, or they don't remember the older games. I've played it on the hardest difficulty and rarely ran out of ammo, there was absolutely nothing that made me jump or think "Oh man, I can't believe that one guy I don't remember died". I honestly think I'm only going to play this until I get the maximum amount of trading cards possible from this.\n\nIf you're itching for that Resident Evil feeling, don't play this. If you wan't to play it for the story, just watch the sequences on youtube or something. Or read the wiki.

You'd have a hard time squeezing more than 30 hours out of this title for what little there is to do in the game.\nThe sheer quality of the game is lackluster at best. They didn't add or improve any textures at all to fit a larger screen than a 3DS. The enemies and enviroment are bland in the best case scenario, and most of the enviroments are repeated in the game. It feels like a lot of pointless running around because of the lack of fresh content.\nThe story was pretty terrible if you never read the Divine Comedy, because you just have nothing to relate to the plot's only allusion. The story lacks any form of symbolism, and frankly the character line up is worse than ever (ANY other title). It looks like they turned from even moderately paced action shooters like 4 or 5 and tried to tie the experience to a survival horror. The problem is that it lacks any of the puzzles that a survival horror should have, and without a story, it has nothing to offer the player motivation to complete the title.","August 4, 2014","false","15.9"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Basically, from what I've read and watched on the internet, this goes more back to its roots in the first RE series, where it's supposed to be survival horror. The thing is, is that the survial element is in, but not the horror; I've played games like Slender, Dead Space, and Alan Wake, and sorry to those who like RE, there is NO horror element found here. Just the frustrating survival element that's more irrate than survival.\n\nPros: The game looks really nice; graphics, textures, modles, the works. Everything looks nextgen.\n\nCons: Aside from what I've listed at the top, that's pretty much it. There is nothing good here. The story is dry, and boring (seriously, first 5 minutes in the game I was watching a cutscene, I was like "I don't give a flying ♥♥♥♥, SKIP".), the characters are as planned as the story, and the voice acting was subpar at most.\n\nGameplay: Now like I said, I never played the first RE titles, just RE5, which I loved. But in accordance to that, it feels like I'm not some bad ♥♥♥ agent, but more like someone saving every single bullet I come accross, which is what most combat is like; you're not killing the zeds, you're running from them. Because heaven forbid you come accross a hallway blocked by zeds, and you can't shoot your way out, you have to ♥♥♥♥ing knife them. If not, you have to run and dodge them. The dodge system is simlar to Alan Wake's in that you have to time you're enemies attack to get out of the way. This would be good, except that it's the same button as the 180 degree turn. If you don't time it perfectly, which I suck btw at stuff like this, you'll turn and face the wrong way and eat ♥♥♥♥. The enemies vary their attacks to a quick jab, to a haymaker type punch; hard to time this ♥♥♥♥, but then again, that's just me. They also done away with the life bar; basically, three hits and you're dead.\n\nI preferred more an action based game, not...what ever this is. Again, I've never played the originals, but if they were anything like this, I'd stay away.","July 15, 2014","false","2.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/imthetoad/recommended/222480/","imthetoad","TheToad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/imthetoad/","996 products in account","This is the first Resident Evil game that I ever played, and it is in my opinion a great way to get familiar with the series.\n\nI didn't know much about Resident Evil before playing this game. I had watched a couple of the movies, which were not great, but as is often the case the movies don't really have that much in common with the games. The movies can't compare to the games.\n\nThe story in this game revolves around Jill and her current partner Parker who are sent out to investigate a cruise ship after the corpses of some strange creatures appear along the shore. Things don't go as planned (as is often the case with these types of games), so Chris and his current partner Jessica are sent out to look for Jill and Parker.\n\nThe story is very episodic, and feels almost more like a tv-series than a game. You have the "main episodes" focusing on Jill, the "flashback episodes" focusing on Parker, and the "side episodes" focusing on Chris. The weapons that you collect as Jill carry over from episode to episode, however during the flashbacks you only have access to a limited supply of weapons, making it feel like a very different experience compared to how it is on the boat.\n\nThe weapons are the "Resident Evil standards": handguns, shotguns, machine guns, rifles and magnums. However, unlike some of the Resident Evil games that I played after this one (mainly the 4th and 5th games), you have some very useful grenades at your disposal. In addition to regular hand grenades you also have flash grenades, shock grenades and "decoy grenades", and learning when to use these grenades efficiently is key to beating some of the tougher enemies.\n\nIn addition to the story mode there is also a "raid mode". This removes the story aspect of the game, and instead puts you up against hordes of enemies (with their health bars showing), allows you to upgrade your weapons and buy ammo in between missions, and can be played co-op with another player. This mode feels so different from the story mode that you can almost think of it as a different game all together. It feels and plays like an FPS game, which is why, unlike Resident Evil 4 and 5, I prefer to play this game using a mouse and keyboard.\n\nThe atmosphere in this game is great. I have always hated "water levels", so running around on a sinking ship with water flowing in everywhere and flesh eating mutated fish jumping at you should not be something that I would enjoy - but I did. I thought it was great!. The sounds and music also help create a nice and creepy atmosphere. Personally I think the game looks great, and I was pretty surprised to learn that it was originally a game made for the Nintendo DS.\n\nAfter having played this game I knew that I definitely wanted to try out the other games in the series, and so far I have played through Resident Evil 4 and 5, but I'm really looking forward to playing the (HD remakes of) the original trilogy. People who have played the other games in the series will surely enjoy this one as well, and even If you have never played a Resident Evil game before in your life, this is probably as good of a place as any to start.\n\nDefinitely recommended.\n\nResident Evil 4 Review","April 29","true","94.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

For those fans Capcom made Resident Evil Revelations which originally came out for Nintendo DS and was later ported to all the main platforms. Does this version of Resident Evil really go back to its roots? And is this a good port from the Nintendo DS?\n\nDisclaimer: I love Resident Evil 1 HD Remaster (the first time I played RE1), I really like Resident Evil 5, I like Resident Evil 4 and the Leon Campaign of RE6 wasnt that bad.\n\nGameplayWell. Not only are there only very few "horror"-sections in this game (which were supposed to be the main part), but also these horror-sections arent horror at all. There isnt a single scary moment in this game, not even a creepy atmossphere like in Resident Evil 4 or the Leon Campaign in Resident Evil 6. The biggest design flaw of this game is that you have a coop partner with you (AI driven). This not only makes the game less scary than it already is, but also the AI is HORRIBLE and the game isnt even properly designed with coop in mind. The only thing your partner does is sometimes distract enemies and other times give you some additional fire power.\nLet me makes this clear: This game is VERY far away from survival horror, but the problem is even as an action game it fails in many parts. The guns feel weak, have ugly sounds, ugly animations, clonky movement system, boring level design, boring weapons and also many unnessesary weapons. This game felt like a japanese MMO with tons of grinding most of the time, especially because it was so damn easy, probably because its a port from the nintendo DS where you have worse controls so it gets easier on PC just because of Mouse+KB.\nThe "puzzles", if you can even call them puzzles, were uninspired and boring. The worst parts of this game is when you are trapped in an area and you have to fight waves of enemies which is extremely dull.\n\nBut there is one thing which I want to give this game huge credits for and thats the creature design which is actually one of the best creature designs of all Resident Evil games, however for every cool enemy there is also a boring, uninspired enemy.\nBut especially the very first enemy you meet in the game is really cool, because their ugly look not only makes them look scary, but also because of their weird movement it makes headshots more challenging. If Capcom would capture the survival-horror atmossphere of the previous games in this game, these enemies would make you ♥♥♥♥ your pants.\n\nThe thing is, if you consider that this game was originally made for the nintendo DS you can understand why it cant be good. Not because the DS is a bad handheld, but survival horror simply doesnt work on DS and if you make an action game you have to make it very simple for the DS, which is way too simple if you port it to PC.\n\nThats why I am excited for Revelations 2, because that game is made primarily for PC and current-gen consoles, but there you also have Coop and multiple playable characters so we will see...\n\nNarrativeThe narrative of this game is absolute garabage and functional at best. Not only is it full of annoying and cliche characters, it also is told in a very boring way, because it keeps jump from location to location. When you play some time with Jill and get used to the Queen Zenobia, suddenly the chapter ends and the next chapter starts at a completely different location with diferrent characters. I guess they wanted to introduce many characters (some from previous RE games) and make their storys connect later, but the ONLY reason they did this is because they needed filler and they wanted to have some action between the "horror" parts of the game (which arent horror as I explained).\nEvery character in this game is SO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cliche, terribly written and annoying, even known characters like Jill and Chris are so bad in this game (what the ♥♥♥♥ happenend to Jill´s face and voice?). Chris is the only character which isnt annoying.\nAlso the game does take itself serious but at other times makes some stupid jokes and both of these dont fit at all, especially if you want to make survival horror (which this game isnt anyway).\n\nAestheticsUgly. Only word I can describe this game is ugly. Character models, weapons models and the location, everything is ugly. Of course this is because of the technical limitations of the Nintendo DS, but they could still put some effort into the design of the places. Only thing which is designed really good are the enemies (but there are also many ugly enemies, and with ugly I mean bad).\n\nSoundtrackDidnt even notice any kind of soundtrack, its just some random music in the background.\n\nGraphicsOh my, the graphics of this game are worse than playstation 2 games even if it runs at 1080p60fps. I know its a DS port, but they could at least put SOME effort into and increase the quality of the textures and make better character models.\nThis game is just a pain to look at.","February 18, 2015","false","5.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

That 3DS game that was one of the first to have a demo so all the nine year olds could simultaneously ♥♥♥♥ themselves and ♥♥♥♥ their parents off for lying about their age? Ya, that one. It made it’s way on to PC, and I’m happy about that, because it made the Humble Monthly slightly less ♥♥♥♥ in a really contrived way, and is good. Keep in mind that the computer I used to beat the game has about as much processing power as a modded ZX Spectrum with a slightly better resolution, so that may have hindered the experience. And let’s just get the PC Master race ♥♥♥♥s out of here quick; it’s 60FPS, so you can go back to circle jerking to old Zero Punctuation episodes. Also, the only other Resident Evil I’ve played is Six, and Six is referring to it’s review score out of ten if you divide it by 3, so my hopes weren’t very high here, however wrong that assumption was.\n\nGeneral info about the gameYou play as, wait, scratch that, I’m pretty sure you play as almost every character at some point. But the missions sort of revolve around Jill and Parker for the majority of the game. Jill is otherwise known as Generic White Chick #1, with Kardashian levels of cleavage showing and almost no rounds for the only 9mm she brought on board. Parker is a kind of interesting European dude, who is super buff, but not so cookie-cutter I’d call him generic. Anyways, ♥♥♥♥ hits the metaphorical fan, stuff goes down, lalala. I won’t get into the story because it’s actually pretty good.\n\nWhat is trash?First, we go over the trash portions of this game. The most obvious trash part is the god damned optimizations. I know I said I’m running a garbage computer, but somehow I manage to get 30FPS (PC Master Race: *heavy triggering*) in combat, and 5 FPS when walking into slightly different areas. The mere idea of anything below 60 is ♥♥♥♥ing ridiculous considering this game runs on the potato formally known as the 3DS. Other than that, boss fights are slower and more boring than pretending to be interested at a funeral for that one ♥♥♥♥-head uncle you have that you really don’t care about but have to play pretend for a couple hours. You literally pummel over 100 rounds into these blobs of flesh and they still have the audacity to attempt wipe their ♥♥♥ with you. RE’s idea of a boss fight is taking a normal enemy, finding the “Properties” tab, then increasing size, health, and damage. Then they litter the room with vents strangely all along the ground as if the place is made for umpa loompas or some ♥♥♥♥, then ♥♥♥♥ the screen with enemies. The thing RE doesn’t understand is that just making a ton of enemies then put a bounty on your head doesn’t make it horror. The less you see the enemy, the scarier it is, they aren’t our car pool buddies.\n\nBut now, now, I dedicate an entire paragraph to the final boss fight. If you don’t like spoilers, stick your head in a fishbowl then paint it black or something, because the spoiler train is docking at this station. First off, you are granted with this man who injects himself with a red virus I kind of assumed was Kool-Aid, then half expected the man to turn into the Kool-Aid man and run around yelling “OH YEAH” at me while breaking walls. Sadly, he just turns into a 7 foot baddie that can take more 12 gauges to the heart than an enraged chimpanzee on steroids. He then teleports his dumb ♥♥♥ right in front of you so you can ogle the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ model and how the graphics artist tried to cover that up with glares from light sources that don’t exist. He then shows his heart for approximately enough time to fire twice, three times if you’re ♥♥♥♥ing Clint Eastwood. You then repeat this about 30 times, or until you are out of health kits and waiting to die. This all happens while your partner stands off to the side pretending his downs is acting up so he doesn’t have to fight alongside you. The best part about this fight is that if you don’t hit the heart, the attack didn’t happen. You can throw a grenade at his feet, but no damage done. He doesn’t even flinch. But what’s even worse than all of that is the fact that I was playing on Easy because playing at anything above Easy requires more reaction time than 15 FPS can grant me. I couldn’t imagine what that would be like on hard. I’d have a tourniquet around my neck before I did that on insane.\n\nWhat is good and alright?Other than that ballocks, the cutscenes are alright, weapons are cool, customization is pretty good, but now I get to rant about something else: the magnum. So about a third through the game you start picking up magnum rounds. Before that you would pick up shotgun shells, and then you get a shotgun shortly after. But here, you don’t get the magnum until about 80% through the game. So here I am, looking like a ♥♥♥♥ing 60 year old dementia patient looking around every corner for something that doesn’t exist for about half the game. Then I find the magnum, or Desert Eagle, but no copyright infringement so its some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ rip off name like “HaWk 7-l3n,”  you have about 20 rounds for the rest of the game. So that is roughly 10-15 kills with that. Not bad, now what if you run across a boss? “Well ♥♥♥♥ you,” Capcom says with the kind of grin 19th century English landlords had when their tenants gave them about 90% of their food as rent. So I basically gave my regular pistol all the dope upgrades, almost to the point where the other weapons looked like someone forgot about a unit in Civilization V for 300 years and now it’s carrying spears when everyone else has M16’s; effectively useless.\n\nSteam says it took me 10 hours to beat the game, not a bad amount of time. I mean, that’s trash for anyone who paid $35 for it, but in my case I traded I think Rust for it, so that’s pretty good. However, Resident Evil says it took me 5 hours to complete it. Maybe this was result of  15 FPS, or maybe I spent like 5 hours idling or getting off to the wide array of graphics options for my slight PC Master Race side. Either way, I ♥♥♥♥ing hope raid mode makes up for that, even though I don’t know what it is. Throughout the campaign, it kept saying “unlocked strap-on ♥♥♥♥♥ #12 for raid mode” or different variations, but little did the game know that I give less ♥♥♥♥♥ about that than Christians’ opinions.\n\nThis game definitely earns the “Developer fap material” award, since there wasn’t a woman in the game that didn’t have either half her ♥♥♥♥ showing or generally missing pieces of clothes you’d think you’d want on a spec ops mission. One of the women are missing half of their pants. Like, it literally is just missing. There is one full leg, then one missing. This isn’t a ♥♥♥♥ing Victoria’s Secret fashion show. The girls are all hot, but then you got to wonder if they made a prerequisite for joining the armed forces “Has to be a model and have minimum of D-cup bra.” (Yes, I had to look that one up.)\n\nConclusionSo is the game good? Yes. Is it worth $35? If you are okay with games shorter than the lifespan of Chinese sweat shop workers, then yes, it’s worth it. And before you hit that “report” button, realize that I’m not racist, I hate everyone equally.","December 12, 2015","true","12.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","2"

But there is ONE thing that stopped me from playing.\n\nForget the crappy textures, the dumb story, the ridiculous enemies called B.O.Ws (they're more disturbing than scary), or the silly scanning system (at least in Metroid Prime we could actually read on the stuff we scan, here its just for getting health and finding invisible items). Nay, one thing, made me say NEVER AGAIN.\n\nThat boss. Holy ♥♥♥♥ that boss. Made me ♥♥♥♥ my pants man.\n\nThere's a reason why survival horror is so distinct from other shooters : you don't want to fight. If you fight, its because you got backed in a corner, that you have no other choice. You use precious resources that you need to manage. You avoid areas with many monsters and use stealth to survive. Sometimes, like in Amnesia : the Dark Descent, you have no weapon at all and must avoid monsters at all costs.\n\nNot this game. This game broke my suspension of disbelief so hard I laughed. Don't be fooled, its a silly 3rd person action shooter just like the other "modern" Resident Evils.\n\nWhat happened is this : you arrive in this area. Theres a few monsters, so I pick them off with my pistol. Its a shopping mall. I secure the area (since you can't stealth), get some items, lift open a gate. I hear this weird voice. "Mayday, mayday, help us (...)". Its the comms officer I'm supposed to go find for the key to the communications room. Then i see something wrong : a door is being banged on and shaked and theres a lock on it. Let me ask you : what would any sane person do? Especially in a survival situation? You'd probably GTFO OF THERE RIGHT?\n\nBut no, you're expected to shoot the lock and release teh creature within. Cuz you need the key. Nevermind that you could pick the lock, or smash the door down. No, its much easier to fight A FRIGGIN' ABOMINATION WITH A FLESHY CHAINSAW FOR AN ARM, THAT RUSHES AT YOU AND INSTA-KILLS YOU!!!\n\nIts a typical boss fight. It chases you around the area, enemies spawn EVERYWHERE, and you can only slow it down and damage it by blowing up conveniently placed gas tanks at every corner of the level. Only, theres a few problems.\n\nNumber one : its the ugliest most disturbing thing ever.\nNumber two : this is an insane difficulty spike compared to the things before.\nNumber three : its dumb and ruined the atmosphere.\n\nI was like "NOPE!" I'm sorry but I am not going through that again for any more than a third time. Uninstall!\n\nYou have been warned.

This game also takes place before 5 although some things like Jills older look (though I guess that you could put that down to the fact that the game was originally done on a Nintendo console) and some of the technology available like the fact of a city built on the water are hard to believe because of the timeline.\n\nThe gameplay is a lot like that of 6 in the fact that you can move whie aiming but with the restraints of 4 in terms of melee combat. There is also a dodge feature that Jill originally had in 3 but it isn't as reliable as that one as you can never be too sure if it is going to register properly and this can be a problem as some of the enemies and bosses play out that you can damage them by dodging them when they go to charge at you whic will leave them open to attack.\n\nYou can only carry a total of three guns at one time and ammo is actually scarce if you play on normal and if you feel up to the challenge, infernal. The upgrade system for guns is also back but you can never really upgrade them enough to think that you can kill everything and still complete the game with loads of ammo for every gun. The upgrades are also interchangeable so you can change what your guns atributes are if you want to tr using it to stun enemies more of veen give one of them a burst ability.\n\nThe order in which you get weapon types is a bit weird in the whole fact that you can end up getting the stronger version of a weapon type before you get the weaker versions and some of the weaker versions can only be gotten by doing things like playing he game on infernal as that is the only mode that they appear on.\n\nOverall if you are a fan of the series of old, mainly 4, and want to play a decent modern Resi game then you should definately give this game a try\n\nscore 86/100\n\n\n","April 9, 2014","true","67.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There are action moments but nothing over the top like RE 5 and RE 6.\n\nYou will play mostly on a ship infested by the new T-Abyss virus.  The ship is rather well crafted and interesting to navigate.  Jill and Chris are BACK!!  Just that is worth a purchase if you are a fan of old resident evil.  Story is interesting, although I didn't find any of the new characters memorable.\n\nAs for the multi-player, raid mode is very fun.  Go through stages of the single player map and take down mobs after mobs. Upgrade guns and mod them and repeat.  Gets addictive.

This game also takes place before 5 although some things like Jills older look (though I guess that you could put that down to the fact that the game was originally done on a Nintendo console) and some of the technology available like the fact of a city built on the water are hard to believe because of the timeline.\n\nThe gameplay is a lot like that of 6 in the fact that you can move whie aiming but with the restraints of 4 in terms of melee combat. There is also a dodge feature that Jill originally had in 3 but it isn't as reliable as that one as you can never be too sure if it is going to register properly and this can be a problem as some of the enemies and bosses play out that you can damage them by dodging them when they go to charge at you whic will leave them open to attack.\n\nYou can only carry a total of three guns at one time and ammo is actually scarce if you play on normal and if you feel up to the challenge, infernal. The upgrade system for guns is also back but you can never really upgrade them enough to think that you can kill everything and still complete the game with loads of ammo for every gun. The upgrades are also interchangeable so you can change what your guns atributes are if you want to tr using it to stun enemies more of veen give one of them a burst ability.\n\nThe order in which you get weapon types is a bit weird in the whole fact that you can end up getting the stronger version of a weapon type before you get the weaker versions and some of the weaker versions can only be gotten by doing things like playing he game on infernal as that is the only mode that they appear on.\n\nOverall if you are a fan of the series of old, mainly 4, and want to play a decent modern Resi game then you should definately give this game a try\n\nscore 86/100\n\n\n","April 9, 2014","true","67.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The system has a strong hint of being only half-implemented or something added in mostly for new-game plus (or to allow for more weapon types) it's almost like a first attempt at a DLC platform for some cheeky "bonus" paid for content but with access being strictly limited to in-game storage crate use the save-game based inventory system feels an odd choice.","May 14, 2015","true","16.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game was a nightmare for me, literally. I could not force myself to play more than 15 minutes each time I try. It just doesn't have the same Resident Evil feeling that I get from previous RE 1-5. The style of the game is much different, the gameplay is weird, the monsters are weird, the story is weak, and they resort to a lot of 'jump scares' instead of the normal tension building or suspense scares. The only thing I like about this game is the graphics. This will be the first RE game I will not complete and I will go back to play RE 1-5 again. They're straying a bit too far away from the normal formula that makes the game what it is. Now it's becoming something else that we don't need, a first person shooter. This is what happens when RE meets Call of Duty or Battlefield. What next? Zombies/Monsters will know Kung Fu and have weapons as well so it'll become Tekken or Halo?\n\nPros:\n- Good graphics.\n\nCons:\n- Mainly jump scares. No tension building or suspense from previous titles.\n- Weak story.\n- Too much weapon and ammo. It's like Call of Duty meets Resident Evil.\n- No zombies. At least add some. Monsters are weird and some invisible... really.","July 4, 2015","false","6.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

On the whole it was a bit easy and the story was kind of predictable, but the gameplay was solid, the enemies were cool and different from what we've seen before (though more variety would have been nice) and the maze-like cruise ship was a joy to explore.\n\nSome minor annoyances do exist such as the high frequency of "previously on Resident Evil: Revelations" recaps and the generally shoddy english localisation, but for the most part it's a solid, if somewhat samey, entry in the series.\n\nNote that the main campaign of this one DOES NOT HAVE CO-OP.

Is it just nostalgia for old Resident Evil because RE5 and RE6 were so awful? You can try to put lipstick on a pig all you want, this game is decidedly medicore. The old tank like controls for RE aren't the least bit compelling without a decent atmosphere to help it along. The optimization attempt during the conversion from a portable platform (Nintendo 3DS) to PC is laughably substandard. It looks like middle-gen PS2 game at best.\n\nI realize that plot and dialogue (Yay for Jessica's "sweet ♥♥♥!") have never been the priority for any RE games, but in Revelations, it's comically absurd and don't get me started and the laughably bad character designs. The gameplay and level design are just so bland. Again, this was ported from a portable platform and Capcom did little to hide it. The limitations show at all times.\n\nI get where Capcom was trying to go with this in trying to satisfy RE fans, but this feels more like a mockery than fan service.

This game was a nightmare for me, literally. I could not force myself to play more than 15 minutes each time I try. It just doesn't have the same Resident Evil feeling that I get from previous RE 1-5. The style of the game is much different, the gameplay is weird, the monsters are weird, the story is weak, and they resort to a lot of 'jump scares' instead of the normal tension building or suspense scares. The only thing I like about this game is the graphics. This will be the first RE game I will not complete and I will go back to play RE 1-5 again. They're straying a bit too far away from the normal formula that makes the game what it is. Now it's becoming something else that we don't need, a first person shooter. This is what happens when RE meets Call of Duty or Battlefield. What next? Zombies/Monsters will know Kung Fu and have weapons as well so it'll become Tekken or Halo?\n\nPros:\n- Good graphics.\n\nCons:\n- Mainly jump scares. No tension building or suspense from previous titles.\n- Weak story.\n- Too much weapon and ammo. It's like Call of Duty meets Resident Evil.\n- No zombies. At least add some.

It's close though, but I think a positive review with warnings and reservations, would be too highly rated.\n\nI have played it for ten hours and I am bored now. I have no motivation even to finish it to see what the story is. I will most likely drag myself through to the end though.\n\nIt started OK though. I liked the enemies a lot, because they were properly freaky; weird things that look like they can not see. However it soon became apparent there was a nasty stuttery bug. Every ten seconds the RER freezes for half-a-second, to a second, and it happens right through the game. No fix for it online. (Only a fix for it in RER2.)\n\nSecondly, the graphics are weak for a 2012 release. They would have been average in 2006. There is not one 'stop to look at the graphics moment' ever. Not only are the textures poor, but there is not one image of anything worth looking at. Regardless of graphics detail. Everything is just average.\n\nInitially though I was loving it. The game moved on quite quickly, because I was not getting stuck much, or dying over and over. I put aside my negative feelings and played. However as time went on I realised the entire map was just being re-used, endlessly. In other words it should be called Resident Evil Backtracking. It's a maze too.\n\nBy about 7 hours play I was bored and I was hoping it was going to end soon. Then I was hoping it would end now. At ten hours I thought I had beaten the last boss - great. Nope, there was a filler in, which took me back to a previously used map, and had me slowly moving around it.\n\nPap pap pap goes the pistol. The gun that you always avoid in games. They make you use it lots. Really there is nothing more to latch onto, to remain interested.\n\nThe good points are some of the enemies, the atmosphere intially, and the fact you don't die too often.","May 6","false","11.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I got the game for pennies so it's no big deal, but HOLY HELL can you tell this came from the handheld 3DS system. Right off the bat, it was unplayable on a TV with it's super low FOV. Thankfully this could be fixed by the "Widescreen Fixer" application.\n\nBeyond that what you have here is a very stripped down Resident Evil experience. While it has some control refinements over, say, RE4, its been vastly improved upon by it's sequel, Revelations 2. I say jump to that game and just watch summary videos of this one, if you must. There's absolutely no one online here anyway, so the raid mode is a bust. Its my opinion that the franchise hasn't had a plot worth following past RE3, but even if you disagree, I think anyone can tell this is shaped up to be an afterthought from the core series. I wouldn't pay more than a few bucks for this.\n\nThey did their best with the PC port, in that the videos are HD quality, and the textures, frame rate, models, etc are all as good as one could hope coming from the 3DS.

I will give you revelation -> this game sux. I could not stand playing for more than 3 hours. Just... impossible.\n\nTL-DR : I got this game for free. And I did not even get my money's worth. I do not recommend it at all.This was the first Resident Evil game I played and I believe it will be the last.\n\nWhat is this game about? Protagonist is a crippled person, uncappable of anything but slow walk. So you charge at your enemies with agility of 95 yo grandpa with clutches. You can not even move a chair if it blocks your path. You shoot zombies that hardly notice it. You scan desks with scanner to find hidden ammo. You look for keys to find doors to get you to doors that you need to find key to open, to get to door that you have no card to open and need to slowly walk to another door that magically opened at your convenience to get it...\n\nGameplay is terrible. Terrible. You can not dodge or block in normal way, nor jump or crouch. Not even run. You just walk with zombies behind you. And if you shoot them, even in the head, they do not even react, they do not flinch. They are not thrown back even if you shoot them with shotgun to the chest at arms length. And you must be almost stationary to shoot. No Run and Gun. Nope. If you try that, you swing knife at enemies... You want to spray them down while backing like hell? Nope, not here.\n\nAh, there is a door! (the corridors are a few metres long, then there is a door. Always a door... every few steps. And the monsters disappear or appear when you go through that door. And you always close the door behind you. Smart). There is some debris blocking your path, that you coul walk over (not even need to jump) ? Too bad, you need to take a de-tour.\nThere is NO place for cyber-athletics, no agility.  No using corners, ducking, running back and charging at enemy when you see fit. Nope, not here.You just walk at enemies at the speed of dying turtle, shoot them (shooting makes no difference until enemy suddenly drops dead) and open doors.\nAh, and eat a plant that grows everywhere to magicaly restore your health. And use super-advanced scanner to find ammo you can not see otherwise.\n\nTasks are extremely dull and boring Every zombie runs at you. Every one tries to kill you. Unless the zombie carries a key that you need. Then, for some reason, it runs away from you... and you need to chase it to the start of the level, so the game  seems longer and not so linear. So you end up walking here and there like a confused freshman looking for his class. Go get the key to get through this door. Ah god, why not learn how to pick that locks, they seem to be everywhere...\n\nShooting does not feel natural. It has no real effect on the enemy, apart from lowering their health bar. So you are stationary, can not run, and can not use guns to clear some space. You just stand, walk back slowly and shoot. It is extremely boring. No satisfaction in killing enemies, no thrill in battless. None at all.\n\nThe atmosphere is not like in a horror movie. It feels like in a parody of a horror movie. There is actually no atmosphere at all. The game controls feel so unnatural that it just will not let you fall into the story. The battles are so dull you will get no rush of adrenaline. They try to make it scary, and they fail miserably. A zombie attacked me from a washing machine... seriously? A lot of jumps scenes that try to scare you, but they simply do not work at all... The only "scary" moment is when the game crashes and you are afraid of losing your save file.\n\nYou want a good horror-shooter game? Go and buy Metro 2033 redux and thank me later. Leave this be.

It offers a nautical resident\nevil 'experience', for better or for worse depending on the taste of the player. There is a horror\nof a sort here, but it is underused considering the setting and isolation of the sea.\n\nThe controls handle well, but the fact you have to use the mouse to shoot, without being given the option to map it to the keyboard, is a massive drawback- Resident Evil 5 allowed you to do so in its own PC port, so it seems inexcusible to have it absent here. Otherwise, most of the other controls are no different from previous iterations. Being able to charge one's physical attacks is satisfying but it breaks up the frenetic flow of combat a little too much.\n\nThe further lack of an inventory system again moves away from the crux of what has come to have been expected from the series; it feels too deliberate an attempt at distancing itself other games. In addition, the lack of variety in enemy types is also rather disappointing, although the designs of those included are suitably grotesque. The scanner, however, is one addition which I think works well, though it has teething troubles here from being typecast in a similar vein to the 'vision' mechanic present in recent Batman, Lara Croft and Hitman games.\n\nAltogether, this is a back-to-basics Resident Evil game, which it strengthened and weakened by this move, but its glaring flaws for me cannot be balanced by its positive ones. Go for the first Dead Space game instead- it is a more effective and streamlined horror shooter game.","May 1","false","0.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It plays like an older Resident Evil game. It's heavy on the wandering around looking for where to go next, solve the next puzzle. It seems like a step back from the other titles such as Resident Evil 4 and 5. The graphics are certainly inferior. The sound is ok.\n\nI believe it was originally developed as a 3DS title, which frankly explains a lot.\n\nFor die hard fans of the series only, it's a bit of a struggle to play and not very enjoyable. The action/shooter elements of the game feel like something from 15 years ago. The plot is hilariously bad. The maps are confusing.\n\nMy advice: Go straight to Revelations 2. Much better game.","May 19","false","4.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

However Capcom has added some extra's to the PC version like new enemies, weapons, kits and ofcourse the graphics.\n\nRaid mode is also alot harder now and requires teamwork especially on the harder difficulties once you unlocked them. This makes RAID mode more rewarding and no longer a walk in the park like on the 3DS.\n\nThe single player is still exactly the same and during the campaign you play as different characters uncovering the secret behind the Queen Zenobila and Veltro. If you are and old school RE fan I higly reccomend this game 8/10.","June 23, 2013","true","44.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/leetcreme/recommended/222480/","leetcreme","LeetCreme","http://steamcommunity.com/id/leetcreme/","99 products in account","Resident Evil Revelations is another step in the downward trend of the Resident Evil franchise. The fact that the HD version came out after the sixth installment is what makes it seem better than it actually is, because frankly anything is better than Resident Evil 6,\n\nThe setting is appropriate for a horror game, having been explored previously in the series with Resident Evil Gaiden and Resident Evil Dead Aim. One cannot criticize this story without doing so for the other games in the series because it's just as silly as the previous games, albeit without any of the charming character of Resident Evil 1 or 4 (both directed by Shinji Mikami, coincidentally).\n\nIt's a shame that they had to complicate such a simple story by going back and forth in time making the player control a variety of characters, most of them unecessary, a consequence of Capcom's decision to incorporate co-op or AI partner all the time. What ends up happening is that you have lots of names, throwaway characters and  a breaking of pace as a result of playing out irrelevant events in the story (playing as Chris in a boat to show him boarding the cruise ship for instance).\n\nThe gameplay is a step forward from Resident Evil 5, and a more sober affair than the mess that is Resident Evil 6's combat system. You move and shoot/stab and can occasionally stun an enemy to perform a high powered physical attack, which is satisfying. Less so are some of the enemies with instant death kills, which are a little cheap, but it's nothing new for the series. The gameplay does become tiring though, because the enemies are designed as bullet sponges and are very repetitive. That's not to say the zombies in the previous games are not, but they were shorter experiences as well.\nThankfully, the quick time events from RE4 and RE5 take a break in the game, being relegated to escaping an enemy's grasp and turning valves.\n\nBeing originally a 3DS game, some of the geometry and facial expressions do look a bit basic, and some of the textures are not up to PS3/360/PC standards, but it's not a bad looking game, it looks on par with early generation graphics. It's certainly well optimized and runs better than Resident Evil 4 Ultimate, which is mind boggling.\n\nThe difficulty of the game is balanced, but with some spikes that detract from the TV series approach and pace of it, namely in the boss battles that can be quite infuriating in the first tries. The Infernal difficulty mode is different from RE5's Professional mode but just as silly. Instead of overpowered attackers, the enemies become even bigger bullet sponges, turning the game into a brick wall, though it softens as one progresses and gets better gear. It's  a far cry from the challenging but fair Real Survival Mode of the 2002 remake, it's just pulling the bars to make it as unbalanced as it can be.\nTo add to the longevity is the Raid Mode, which is a worse time waster than Mercenaries because it features levelling and each level takes way longer to complete, and the difficulty ramps up to where you need to grind quite a bit through the ship you're already sick of traversing and the enemies you're already sick of fighting from the campaign.\n\nIt's a better game than what came after, and does many things better than Resident Evil 5, but it lacks character and importance in the overall series. For a game that's called Revelations, removing it from the story arch does no difference at all and makes it an entry that can fade to obscurity.","September 30, 2014","false","62.1"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Okay to pick up on a sale, don't buy it if you want a game to bite into.\n\nRaid mode will make up more than 75% of your play time if you're going for 100% completion- and it's basically a master class in the flaws of the game mechanics, not to mention insanely repetitive and grindy.\n\nSome of the things I glazed over during campaign mode became glaringly obvious in raid mode:\n\nenemies spawn from nowhere and most have no movement sounds\ntoo many enemies have instant kill moves\nhealing is too easy, but so is getting hit\nmonsters attack through corners\nmonster hit zones clip through walls\nenemies disappear when they get too close to the camera\nsoundtrack is terrible and floods out the monster sounds- which blend together anyway\nEnemies take forever to kill (spent 10 minutes shooting a single enemy once)\ndodging is annoying- basically a QTE, not a proactive action\nenemies can spawn on top of you and hit you before you can draw your weapon, etc\nYou get no invincibility frames (would be a good thing in a better designed game)\nbuttons are mostly multi-function, so if you try to leave a room, but a monster is waiting to be punched...\nat higher difficulties, recovery time decreases, so stunning is usually a nonviable strategy (making for a more boring game)\nevels are all based on campaign mode\nlevels are designed for coop play\ncoop is dead\nThere's an experience system (WHY?), heavily capping your progress and requiring you to replace your gear\nthe gear system is heavily inspired by diablo\nyou will get a viable weapon one in every four runs (two+ hours of gameplay, assuming you don't die)\nIt felt like they decided that the answer to challenging players is to constantly spawn enemies from two directions+ (meaning it's geared towards coop play) and to make invisible, noiseless enemies with instant kills. Memorizing spawn points, maximizing damage per bullet and relying on my reflexes was fun for about 5 hours. The remaining 40...\n\nGrinding for gear has never been fun. And who makes a "horror" game where most of the monsters don't make noise moving? Sound is probably the most important aspect of horror. Lack thereof should be a unique feature of one type of monster, at most.\n\nThat may sound awesome (it's SUPPOSED to be challenging), except there's so much of it, it's all so similar and takes SO LONG.\n\nI'd say if raid mode took <1/3 of the time and the fun toys dropped BEFORE the last level so you could actually use them while clearing it, this might be a worthwhile game.","May 28","false","127.1"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

This game is not at all like that and it literally made me seasick within two hours. I've pretty much avoided RE since Outbreak because of how bad I heard that this series has become and now I've finally been able to experience the pain that everyone has expressed. This isn't a step in the right direction, but rather a step in the mud only to trip and fall face first in cow ♥♥♥♥.\n\n\nIf only Capcom spent as much time as they did on t!ts and @ss towards making a decent game, we would be in a much different situation. These panty sniffers should just stick to hentai because they're clearly not meant to be in the gaming industry. They've destroyed DMC, RE, Street Fighter, Dead Rising and anyone's pocket book that still supports them.

They tried to do something different than what they've been doing since RE4, and it paid off. While there may not be zombies or traditional B.O.W.s in this game (other than so many dozens of hunters) it is the closest thing to a classic Resident Evil title in years.\n\nRevelations covers the initial days of the BSAA and shows some of the events preceding Resident Evil 5. Evidently the world is in a state where they can build solar powered cities that float on the sea, but not stop making bioweapons. The story revolves around solving the mystery of how BOWs keep showing up in the area with ties to the terrorist organization that got the city destroyed. Obviously, this leads in classic RE fashion to an overly complicated environment - a cruise ship which frankly looks too Spencerian and not remotely like a vacation cruise ship - that, of course, houses a secret bio-weapons research lab.\n\nIn addition to the lab, almost all of the new ancillary characters are revealed to be double agents or traitors, continuing with the trends of RE, and are working for a mysterious organization or for themselves. Thematically, Revelations really is about as close as possible to the older games. It also has plenty of horrible characters and character dialog - between Jessica's forced attempts at appearing sexy to players, Quint and Keiths ridiculous "Internet nerd/black guy with a life" cliches, and Raymond and Rachels haircuts - What the actual f? - the cheese level is easily higher than RE1.\n\nThere is no co op in this game's campaign, either. You are on your own. Rarely ever will your AI teammate be anywhere near you and when they are they truly will not be helpful. As for environment, Capcom did a pretty decent job. Again the cruise ship looks nothing like a cruise ship and it's ridiculous, but what it does is emulate the claustrophobia and grandeur of the Spencer Mansion.\n\nIn addition to the only true Resident Evil plot in years, Revelations also of course contains raid mode.  Essentially, raid mode is Diablo 3 with guns and third person camera. You just play through the campaign levels on varying difficulties, and kill enemies to get new gear and points, but its still quite fun.\n\nAlthough stunted by having been originally developed for 3DS, Revelations is the closest thing to a Resident Evil game since Code Veronica, and does an admirable job of blending both the new and old styles of gameplay.","March 8, 2015","true","122.9"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Out of the new set, you have 4, 5, 6, Raccoon City, then this. This only succeeds at being better than Raccoon City, but that's up for debate since that title wasn't actually made by Capcom. It was a game made by someone else, being skinned to look like a Resident Evil game to sell it. It's definitely the worst, no question, but if you ignore it and only count official Capcom made titles, then this is actually the bottom of the barrel. And that's still quite an accomplishment because RE 6 is just terrible. This game can't even rise to the low bar that RE 6 set. It's sad to see a series get worse with each title rather than better. But let's not get off topic, this is a review for Revelations, specifically, the PC port. I don't own a DS. I own PC, this on PC, and am reviewing this version of it only.\n\nSo what do we got? What we got here is basically a cheap port from the DS. Despite touting how improved the graphics are for PC, it is not up to par with the other titles. There's still tons of low res textures everywhere in the game that they couldn't bother to update. One positive note is that there aren't many cutscenes. RE 6 was infested with more of them than zombies. But the graphics aren't really what kills this game for me... it's the cockteasing. They tease us with a ship that's suppose to have open exploration, much like the older games. A lot of its interior is actually modelled to feel similar to the classic mansion. A haunted/infested cruise ship is the perfect setting for a Resident Evil game, and offers a lot of possible stages. Sounds great, right? Well, it has some of your open exploration... then the other 90% of the game is a linear corridor shooter like the other games. You're also teased with Jill making a return, but again, barely get much time to actually play her. Too much of the game(hint: any is too much) is spent being forced to play these other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you'll only inevitably hate as much as possible and never want to actually play. You're forced to play them, entirely against your will, and will rush their sections as fast as you can because you just want to get back to Jill. They're literally wasting your time. My point is that Capcom found a great potential to make another game, then proceeds to waste that potential, pouring it all right down the tube, in every possible way they can. This is another "shoulda woulda coulda" title, and everything good about the game just makes you wish it was in a better game rather than being wasted in this one.\n\nSpeaking of the characters, they manage to be more annoying and stupid than the ones from RE 6. That says a lot. You are also forced to switch between them constantly whether you like it or not. In RE 6, you were at least able to PICK the one you wanted to play, start to finish. Here they are like "no no no, now you're going to get jerked around every 10 minutes between them all. Have fun fanboy." For example, in RE 6, you could PICK Leon, start to finish, and NOT have to play Chris' Gears of War ripoff at all. Here, no such luck. RE 6 was a disaster partly thanks to having a bunch of differing campaigns that are all junk instead of just having 1 good one(RE 5). Imagine that, but now switching between all of them with no say as to when or which one you play at any given time. Sound fun? IT'S NOT. You'll run down a hallway or open a door then suddenly find yourself dropped into a diferent time and place, and character, for the next 20 minutes, then be dropped back. It doesn't even really add anything to the story and could have just been in an exposition. It just wastes your time with annoying characters you don't want anything to do with, and you're forced to suffer through it until the game "decides" you can go back to where you were on the character you came for and actually wanted to play(Jill). One big bait and switch, this game was.\n\nThe story as a whole does manage to be a lot less ret@rded than RE 6, but it is a spin off story you don't really need to know. It has no real connection to any other game and I doubt any game from now on is going to reference this or the characters here. The story is a convoluted mess, but RE games were never known for stories that made coherent sense. It's not a good story, but it's a servicable story that could have been acceptable in a better game. But that's not what we got, so it's basically all for naught. At this point I wish they'd give us 1 decent game instead of a bunch of crap ones. I'd happily sacrifice 6, Raccoon City, and Revelations, all for "1" decent RE game. CoD fans will hate me for saying this, but quantity is simply not a replacement for quality.\n\nAnother big death nail for this game is the lack of Co Op. Once again we're forced to buddy up through an entire game that should be a solo survival/horror experience, but where as before you could Co Op it, now you can't. Yes, they did the stupidest thing they could with Resident Evil. It finally happened. No, it wasn't adding in Co Op. It was adding in Co Op that you can't Co Op. You're stuck with the stupid A.I. partner, start to finish, and cannot possibly Co Op it. Why is it even there then? Is the partner at least done right, like in RE 5? Hell no. It's RE 6 again, the one that borked it. They copied the one that ruined it instead of the one that was good. To clarify, the partner is invulnerable, has infinite ammo, and shoots water pellets. This is unlike RE 5 where the partner actually felt like a person you had to care about. Sheva needed bullets, she could get hurt, she could die, thus you really felt important to each other to survive. It was the proper way to do a partner, even as A.I. Here however they copied the RE 6 partner system, which was sh!t. They're a complete waste of space. They can't die, and won't kill anything. And since you can't Co Op them, why are they even there?! They ported this to PC, and couldn't be bothered to give us Co Op for the partner, when others on PC and Steam have that Co Op. Talk about not giving a sh!t about their franchise anymore. The partner does nothing but tag along, get in the way of bullets or pathing in the tight hallways, and make stupid remarks that'll make anyone over the age maturity of 13 cringe. They're just wasted space and you'll keep wishing you were alone, in peace and quiet, without them tagging along like an unwanted parasite leeching on your campaign. It's like having an annoying brat watch you play but you can't tell them to go away because you're supposed to be babysitting. Ashley from RE 4 wasn't this worthless or annoying. Not even close. At least she could get hurt, and die.\n\nIn summary, this game is a plate of @ss. I played it start to finish, and I hated almost all of it. I tried to squeeze any bit of value I could out of this to justify my purchase and it just wasn't there. It's a sad pathetic corpse of what used to be a decent franchise, even up to 2009 with RE 5, a game I loved. I leave with nothing but regret, and am saddened that Capcom couldn't care less about what they've done to this franchise since then. It's an abysmal singleplayer experience with no ability to Co Op except for this totally pointless endless repetitive "Raid Mode". If you want a better singleplayer game, it won't be hard to find. If you want a better multiplayer one, it'll be VERY easy to find(Borderlands?). This game is a port that never should have been made, but Capcom knows when they can make an easy buck, and did exactly that. For long time fans like myself, this is probably the last straw. I seriously doubt I'll even consider paying money for a Resident Evil 7, or whatever PoS title leeches off this franchise's hollowed out corpse next.","May 5, 2014","false","13.6"," 7 of 19 people (37%) found this review helpful","37","7","19","0","0"

I loved Resident Evil 4, even though it shed its horror mid way in, and I tolerated Resident Evil 5 because the coop gameplay was fun. Revelations, unfortunately, is not the return to horror it's been marketed as. Instead, this game feels incredibly like an android/iOS game. There is very little complexity; no inventory, no management of herbs or ammo. Environments are restricted making it feel more like a rail shooter than anything else where your only choice is forward or back (akin to Killer7, a much better game). Characters and plot are boring.

At this point I can't remember one where the story or the gameplay is so lame/stupid or worse than that. Let me explain:\n\n- 1st I am on a ship, that has different levels, which is good but the level design is boring, blocked by rooms and doors that open only at certain points in the story. I can't say that I like it, since it's one of the worst way to play a game, worst than liniar gameplay.\n- 2nd the other player, controlled by A.I., it's like it's not even there. He can't hit anything, it's use is zero, while the mobs that attack me will always ignore him.\n- 3rd the weapons... wow I can't imagine anyone designing worse weapons than these. Honest there's no game in the world that has a worse weapon design.\n- 4th the mobs... hell this game has also the most nonimaginative zombies ever created as enemies in a game. They move like a zombie but also do the damage as a tank, while bullets seems to hurt them like... a fly.\n- while the checkpoint system is ok, hell ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ console players can't do ♥♥♥♥ without checkpoints and autoaim, so why not bring it on the PC version... why do we even bother with having mouse + keyboard?\n- I died so many times in this game, more than in all my other games played (around 500 games at least). Hell I die at CS less than in this game and mostly because I either run out of ammo or I have to run from some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mobs... that spawn till the end of time (I meant spawn at infinit).\nI have tried to play every single Resident Evil game and well... all I can say is that these Capcom guys have zero skills at porting game from their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ consoles to PC. I really hate autoaim, I hate the bad control that comes with ♥♥♥♥ ports, I have the zero A.I. the companion NPC has, I hate the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ checkpoint system, I am starting to have Capcom. I might buy the company and fire everyone, just to save their players's souls.\n- I am absolutely speechless on how lame this game is. You need a lot of menus, just to start a simple game. Why? Is that hard to work hard and change the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ console ♥♥♥♥, to simple but efficient PC interface? Why do you even bother launching the game on PC then? Just to see how much frustration a player can feel? The question is... if I do the same to you, will you like it?\n\nThis is by far the worst game that I have ever played. The level of frustration felt while playing... it's close to +infinite.\n\nSadly my score is just 2/10. I can say a lot of bad things, at this point I can't see one that is good.\n\nP.S. Also one can't play in raid the levels. unless he finished those levels in the campaign... which I won't really bother to... finish.","November 20, 2015","false","7.9"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","14","1","7","0","7"

It's a ♥♥♥♥ poor port of the 3DS version of the game (which is even worse than this, so thank Capcom for porting it... I guess?). There's higher resolutions and gameplay changes to Raid Mode so players can't expoit the lewt drop system... but it doesn't stop save editors and trainers... so the point of that was? What exactly? Waste time? Yeah... sounds like it.\n\nThe plot is contrived and stupid... the twists to the plot were obvious so there's really no *gasp, SURPRISE!* moments. If you've been following Resident Evil up until now then you'll be pleasently surprised that you and non-fans are on the same page... I dunno where all these extra characters came from but they suck balls and lack personality. I was lost right from the get go and I'm a huge RE fan... back when RE was RE any way... like the first 4 games.\n\nThere's just too many new faces in this game and it makes me feel like I missed some game that was unreleased. (which I didn't because there is no such thing) These events are supposed to take place between Resident Evil 4 and 5 but they don't do a very good job of explaining how Jill and Chris wound up knowing these new characters or how they got in to the situation they're in... they kind of just banter back and forth between all the bullet spraying about a time they took a trip in Aspin together... or some trivial ♥♥♥♥ like that.\n\nIt's a bit confusing and made me feel detached from the plot. I figured this game was going to stick closer to the roots of Resident Evil but it's just as bad as Resident Evil 4 for missing the point entirely. Instead of fighting Spanards or African's you fight Crab People and other mutated sea dwelling crustations... oh yeah, and wolves... because you know, they have to have some kind of canine enemy in the game to trick people in to thinking they're playing a Resident Evil game. Still hanging on to the original dog jump scare from  RE1, I see, Capcom?\n\nThe game is stale and drab the entire way through, enemies are more annoying than ever to kill and require you to learn the dodge system or get locked in to a one hit kill death... pretty obnoxious. Also I've never seen more annoying enemies that have weak spots on their back side and require you to learn a ridiculously long move set in order to get a 3 second opening.\n\nHunters are back... yay? Not nearly as intimidating as before... in RE1 a single hunter meant about a 70% chance of death if you didn't have a magnum handy... In this game you fight groups of 3 or 4, no issues... it's the action portion of these newer RE's that make my ♥♥♥♥ soft. If I wanted to play Gears of War, I would do so.\n\nAlright on to the multiplayer, it's non-existant for the campaign (I guess that's what Capcom meant by going back to the "roots"... because I see no other resemblance to previous RE games) so grab a friend and head in to "Raid Mode"... A mode designed to bore the living ♥♥♥♥ out of you. You run small gauntlets through fragmented sections of the game with a static set of enemies, always positioned the same way until you memorize not to get hit and make sure you kill everything... sounds like fun? It's not.\n\nIf you're not communicating then expect drop outs during a 20 minute long mission with randoms. (good luck finding anyone who plays this mess now) There's 20 Levels with 3 difficulties all of which must be completed to unlock the bonus stage.\n\nThe bonus stage is about a 40 minute romp through the entire ship where you have to fight the end boss, twice, once in normal form and once in uber form if you're on level 50... so you can, you know, get the "best drops" talk about redundant and unnecessary...\n\nIf you hit level 50 and beat this final level... why would you need better drops? Fail design on Capcom's part... It's already ridiculously excessive and grindy just to get to this point, then tack on more grinding without the leveling and what do you get?

I will add and change it later as needed.\n\nSo... I'm just going to come out and say it...  This game SUCKS.  That's the short answer.  To be fair, I knew it was going to suck from the demo I played before it came out but that's besides the point.\n\nThe long version.\nCons:\nScanning for items.  What.  The.  Hell!   What kind of lame BS mechanic is that!  These supposed people who have dealt with all manner of monsters ranging from rabid acid spitting spiders all the way up to Nemesis and more suddenly cant see the herb that's nestled between a storage rack and sink?  I call BS!\nEpisodic. This.  On its own is a horrible idea for a Resident Evil game.  It kills the immersion in the story at every story and episode break.  I do not even mind the character swapping to see different sides of the story as much when compared to this flaw!\nJessica.  I would be making blond jokes for DAYS if in-fact she was blond.  The sad part is, shes not.  How she managed to get into the same category as Chris and Jill is beyond me!  WHO THE HELL WEARS HIGH HEELS TO A BLOODY FROZEN MOUNTION!!!  And then whines when her feet hurt!  She acts like the standard clingy girlfriend who wants to know everything about you and your past when there is no reason to be asking about it!  Honestly, Id have fed her to the zombies the first chance i got >.>\nThe story.  So far the story is...kinda Blah.  Its not the worst I have seen. ((Cough cough RE5 and 6 Cough Cough)) but its still up there.\nThe inventory.  Where the hell did it go?  Whats with the F buttons half ♥♥♥♥♥ inventory???  Give us back what we had in RE4 or before cause this sucks.  I'm ignoring the whole “Presss TAB to insta heal” thing.\nThe map.  Why is there a mini map?Netural: (This is here because its both good and bad... take it as you will)\nJill.  More to the point, her outfit.  Sexy...but no!  Just no!  Skin tight leathers(I think)?  Why would you do that?  It was not necessary...   BUT....  Appreciated none the less.\nMouse movement.  Its ok, not great though.  It has a slight tendency to jump around or the sensitivity alters randomly.  Still playable however.Good:\nMovement.  The game plays smooth for movement.\nGraphics. Also OK.  The models are decent, the areas are good and detailed.  Some weird effects with water and goo but that is OK\nSub-weapon use.  Able to just press G to chuck grenades while aiming?  Yes please.  One of those things that you just do not thing about until its given to you.Its kinda hard to find anything good about this game currently to be honest...\n\nI will add more as needed.\n\nEDIT:\nI dont know how, but this game got worse...  Now, we have Jill, Chris, The chick from Legaly Blond, 2 of the 3 stooges(Slapstick and all), the emo redhead guy and that other guy whos name escapes me...  This is some horable writing coupled with terrable acting.  Also...Who the hell flys to a ship on a chopper and doesnt check the name on the boat before landing!!!  Its right there!

Everything feels cramped into tight spaces due to the small screen of the 3DS, the game is prob a great feat for the power of a 3DS but everything looks worse than RE 4/5/6 on the PC.\n\nThe story in this game has to be the worst ive seen in RE, its absolutely ♥♥♥♥ poor with crap dialogue and development. The story never managed to grab me like the older games it feels all over the place with episodes dedicated to some new characters that are supposed to act as comic relief "Keith/other guy etc." but it just doesnt do it well. All the new characters except from Raymond are beyond bad and borders more over to a dumb group of BSAA/FBC ? members and ruins the overall mysticim from the characters we already knew before this game with their crappy voices and 1 dimensional depth.\n\nThe gameplay has some good moments over the 12 episodes and approx. 14 hours it took for me to complete it with a good amount of intensity and creepy atmosphere but the pacing is overall poorly done. I was expecting this to be a slower RE game compared to the later console offerings but the game is way more action packed than i expected, theres really no room for breathing between the episodes. 1 episode you will be running down corridors filled with enemies and a timer while in the next episode you will be unarmed for the whole episode and chased in most of the rooms, there are even alot of swimming parts adding more to the overused intensity making the game overall a too intense experience.\n\nTheres some new elements included to the series that are some of the worst additions ive seen in RE games\n\n1. The 3d map is completely useless making moving around the ship a hassle early on when the game unfolds new areas.\n\n2. The worst bit "The Genesis scanner thing" This has to be the absolute worst thing added to a RE game i have ever played. Its a sad excuse for making the game longer than it should be, having to scan the environment all the time you enter a new room for ammo and hidden items doesnt only take away the focus on the crappy plot and gameplay but also makes playing it a chore.\n\nThat said the game still gives you hope for the series later installments a bit after the crappy RE 6 and RCity and fans should still play this as its still have some good bits. The game should probably have been released in between RE 4 and 5 though. I think it actually might be best to purchase it for 3DS aswell as its the original system for the game and might be a better experience on it. Not sure what Capcom was thinking with announcing a sequel to this game though considering how poor the story was in the 1st game, but Capcom hasnt made sense for a long time now.\n\nRating :  6.5/10","October 2, 2014","false","14.6"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","0"

This latest version of Resident Evil Revelations will also deliver additional content including a terrifying new enemy, extra difficulty mode, integration with ResidentEvil.net and improvements to Raid Mode. Raid Mode, which was first introduced to the series in the original version of Resident Evil Revelations, sees gamers play online in co-op mode or alone in single player taking on the hordes of enemies across a variety of missions whilst leveling up characters and earning weapon upgrades. New weapons, skill sets, and playable characters including Hunk, take the Raid Mode experience to new depths.\n\nThe critically acclaimed survival horror title takes players back to the events that took place between Resident Evil® 4 and Resident Evil® 5, revealing the truth about the T-Abyss virus. Resident Evil Revelations features series favorites Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield, plus their respective BSAA partners - Parker Luciani and Jessica Sherawat. The action begins on board a supposedly abandoned cruise ship, the ‘Queen Zenobia’, where horrors lurk around every corner, before players head for the mainland and the devastated city of Terragrigia. With limited ammo and weapons available, the race is on to survive the horror of Resident Evil Revelations.","June 10, 2014","true","951.3"," 13 of 34 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","13","34","0","3"

No waves. Just "go from A to B while killing 15 enemies".  Which is surprising because you effectively have partner with you all the game.\nCo-op mod is being devoloped by fans but it has lot of problems to hurdle first.\n\nDialogue, story and voice acting is pretty horrible and you should NOT buy this "for the story".\nNot even "capcom horrible", they are just plain bad facepalm level. Its super awkward B-movie quality.\nAt first you dont notice it because its your typical Resident Evil one liners of "we need to help CHRIIIS" "OKAY lets GO".\nLater on it you will just think "who intern made this up" and towards end I just couldnt bare the horrid non-surprising story and writing. The low budget and dismissive attidute towards story "because its portable game" shows on this side.\n\nGameplay:\nKinda fun at start if you liked RE5 with mix of RE6 (you can move while aimin but its RE5 styled over the shoulder).\nHowever, it gets REALLY repetive and enemies can get bullet spongy later on. The gameplay is effectively POINT GUN AT ZOMBIE, SHOOT TILL DEAD with very rare QTE "get out when being grabbed". The scanning element is cool addition but you either end up waving that device around most of the game which is distracting or just forget it unless you are out of ammo.\nAround middle you will get the classical "we have to go back to the start of the game because reasons" level re-use, gladly thats fast because you dont have to unlock all doors.. but kinda waste of time.\n\nGraphically:\nShows sings of 3DS port and the animations really show it - your character slides side to side with minimal animations when running around, shadows are blocky and some textures are blurry and not really worthy of "HD".\n\nWould not recommend for full price unless you are diehard RE-fan. Get it cheap.\nIf you are looking for good 3rd person shooter / horror this aint it. Get RE5 or new RE4 HD instead.\nIf you are lookin for cheesy b-movie resident evil  which makes you facepalm and trigger finger numb, this is it.\nIts moddable so thats plus. I guess.\n\nBig plus for the Jill's butt. Because butts.","August 6, 2013","false","15.8"," 6 of 21 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","6","21","0","0"

Aside from a few characters (Jill, and Chris) and a few organizations mentioned (BSAA, Umbrella), everything is wholly original making this game a good standalone for those curious about the franchise. The story is all about spies, bio-terrorism, counter-terrorism, and attempts to go into some interesting psychology behind the villain's motivations but it falls a little flat. The story is told with that same goofy, almost-not-b-movie quality that has become the staple flavor for the series, and for a tale spanning countries with some really fun twists and turns that tone works surprisingly well. Couple that with the game's episodic chapters and it feels like you're watching a low-budget TV show from the 90s, and it's great.\n\nThe gameplay really isn't anything too different than the rest of the series. It has an over the shoulder, third person perspective, shooting certain points on enemies will weaken them and allow you to melee them to great effect (I still think that Chris's fists are more powerful than shotgun blasts). For the majority of the campaign you have an AI partner following you around, ala RE5, except this partner doesn't need your healing items or ammo and can't be controlled by another player, which is actually an improvement for this game. Despite it's similarities to 5, the game actually made me frightened, which only the first game (the Gamecube remake) managed to do. The atmosphere is very well set up, and one of the main locations in the game requires back tracking, but it's done so well you feel like you're running hopelessly in circles. The most frightening, and challenging, part of the game actually has you search for a dead comrade, only to find she has been resurrected as a disgusted squid-mutant-lady, and you then have to hunt her throughout the games main setting, which is a creepy, derelict boat that sways slowly beneath your feet. This moment is when the game really, truly shines as you never know when she's going to pop out and scream in a girlish voice, "found you!" Unfortunately the rest of the game is nowhere near as scary, but it is a lot more tense than any of the resident evil games after the REmake and RE0.\n\nMy disappointments in the game are minor, but still important. After defeating the squid-mutant-lady, non of the game's bosses are particularly challenging, but they are still fun to overcome. However the final boss made me so mad, because he requires almost no strategy to overcome, just a bit of quick timing, he has way too much health, and the fight just drags on. It was not fun for me, some people may enjoy it, but I didn't. Another complaint is that the game is a port from the Nintendo 3DS, which is actually quite amazing the 3DS could handle this game, but it shows. It's supposed to be an HD remake, and some textures are bumped up to a higher quality, but a lot aren't, and some of the level geometry gets blocky, and the "hidden" loading screens consist of doors with spinning wheels, you try to open the door, the wheel spins, and boom you go through. It sounds like a quick and easy way to get the game into small, bite sized chunks and remove loading screens, but I once had a door refuse to open for nearly five minutes (yes, I timed it) and ever since then I would groan when I realized my objective was on the other side of one of those blasted doors.\n\nOverall, this game is really good. I had a ton of fun with it, and despite it's few shortcomings it really is a fun game, I would recommend to anyone who wants a scary Resident Evil, and I would recommend for people curious about the series.\n\nOn a scale of:  1) Avoid like the plague 2) Maybe you'll like it? 3) Not bad 4) Good 5) Amazeballs\nThis game would be a: 4) Good.","December 11, 2014","true","14.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are even tense underwater sections, and the return of the master of unlocking!\n\nThe cherry on top is raid mode, an online cooperative mode for two players, where you fight your way through snippets of the campaign, albeit with more aggressive enemy placement. You collect loot, unlock characters and costumes, and attempt to score well to earn points for purchasing and upgrading skills and equipment. It ties into Capcom's bizarre RE.net website, as well, so you can get a little more use out of the damn thing if you made one for RE6.\n\nOverall, a pretty great game, and something of a return to form for the Resident Evil series.","December 30, 2014","true","17.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Weapons are now socketed equipment able to hold a number of custom components that augment their performance, these components effects range from higher magazine capacity to greater damage output and faster firing rates, among other more unique effects I'll let you discover.\n\nRevelations also features the Genesis system.  The Genesis is a handheld scanner not far off from Metroid Prime's scan visor, and quickly proves to be just as useful, allowing the player to locate easter eggs, hidden items, research dead enemies for healing items, and so forth.  The downside is you'll end up spending quite a bit of time behind the Genesis HUD, which can deflate the horror athmosphere for some.\n\nThe story of Revelations brings the series back to it's zany horror roots, this time mixed with a bit of old school Ace Combat crazy.  Some time after the fictional island utopia of Terragrigia is laid waste by solar sattelite weapons, Jill and Chris find themselves on opposite sides of the globe following the trail of a bioterrorism organization named Veltro, with Jill's search bringing her to an abandoned cruise liner named the Queen Zenobia.  In Resident Evil tradition things quickly go off the rails for both, and the story becomes a globetrotting race against time to unearth the plans of whomever, or whatever, has taken residence on the doomed ship.\n\nThe story also spends a significant amount of time fleshing out the BSAA and the people who work there,  and the game occasionally puts the player in control of a few of Jill and Chris' fellow agents following up on leads the former have discovered.  It provides an interesting look at an organization that has become the series sucessor to the ill fated S.T.A.R.S. unit of the first game.\n\nGraphically the HD upgrade makes the game somewhat above average in visual polish, and a few bland environment textures notwithstanding it looks pretty good for an uprezzed 3DS game.  The character models can be slightly off, Jill's being the most noticable, it would have been nice if the character models and full motion video cutscenes had an upgrade pass as well.\n\nRevelations has several other flaws, the transition to PC has led to some glaring omissions such as the lack of the laser sight present on it's handheld counterpart.  It would have also been nice if the PC upgrade could have had an increase in enemy variety, as most of the undead creatures you'll be facing on the Zeonbia share the same general design.  None of these issues are gamebreaking, however.  And while the game does feature on rails sequences, they're nowhere near the frequency and general unplayability found in those of Resident Evil 6.\n\nBottom line, this is an incredibly successful if somewhat flawed transition from handheld to PC.  And even for those who can't agree on whether Resident Evil 2 or Resident Evil 4 are the pinnacle of the series, there's something for everyone to enjoy.  So if you're a fan of Resident Evil or Survival Horror, you can't go wrong with Resident Evil Revelations.","September 28, 2014","true","24.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game itself was surprisingly decent. I had a whole lot of fun with it and a little piece of advice, the game plays way better with the Keyboard + Mouse scheme (a word of advice though, disable the mouse acceleration though!). With the XB360 gamepad, the aiming was all jerky and you end up missing so many shots.\n\nAs for the game itself, it was so much superior to the pathetic Resident Evil 6 which in my opinion was one of the worse RE game ever made. But this one, RE: Revelations, redeemed itself well enough in its atmosphere setting, the gameplay mechanics, voice acting and even the music department.\n\nTo make it short, this is the game RE6 should have been but wasn't unfortunately!\n\nFor a ported game, the only big noticeable CON would be the graphical and visual side of the game.\n\nPROS:\n+Ghost ship horror atmosphere.\n+Decent campaign length.\n+Neat characters models (well modelized, especialy Jill's Azz!).\n+"Auto-sufficient" A.I. (partner manage itself so no need to run at him/her to heal).\n+Nice soundtrack.\n+Replay value with the Raid Mode or if you seek achievements completion.\n\nCONS:\n-Awful textures.\n-Weak controls with XB360 gamepad.\n-Messy story.\n-Weak A.I. but helpful at times as it brings the enemies to itself.\n-Limited enemy variety (same monsters that you see all game long).\n-No chapter replay option in the main campaign.\n-You cannot run... like, what the hell is that?\n-No puzzles.\n-This is no "survival horror" game like we used to play on the early RE games and keeps the game into the "action horror shooter" mode.\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nDecent port to say the least! If you're a Resident Evil fan, you'll enjoy this game for sure! If you're a new comer, you may want to play earlier titles since you'll be really lost in this game, story speaking!\n\nPS.

Let me first state that I am, indeed, one of those purists that thinks RE1 was the pinacle of the franchise, and that the decision to move away from fixed camera angles really took something of the dread away from every corner and corridoor you couldn't quite see the end of. With that out of the way and taken as a given, Revelations is a good action game. Good, not great, good.\nLet's get the bad stuff out of the way shall we? As an action game, the controls don't really cut it in comparison to other fast-paced action titles. Strafing is a little too slow, particularly for those of us who are used to using strafe to get around corners, and made me feel like I was driving a fire engine rather than an athlete in a cat suit. The bindings are an improvement on previous games, but I still found myself modifying them to match "the norm". There was a distinct lack of hoard activity, which is something I discovered while playing Revelations, that I have come to take for granted since RE2, and was a little confused in the end as to why they were not implemented. What they have done to Hunters also made me shed a tear, and I can only assume it was in order to make dodging have a reason to be included.\nOn to the good stuff! By an absolute country mile, the best thing about Revelations is the story, as you would expect from a long-running franchise. The plot twists and cut scenes were great, and were just as much part of the game as the gameplay itself. Playing as other characters to fill out the story didn't feel like a chore as it does in a lot of games, and I think the key to that is taking the RPG element out of it, and rather focussing on gun modification instead. Kitting said characters out in a somewhat OP fashion always helps though. I thought the inclusion of the "Last time on..." cut scenes after loading a save (and the ability to make them go away too - I'm looking at you AMC) was a great inclusion, especially if I hadn't played for a couple of days. Pretty much the only saving grace for Revelations, as an action game, were the boss fights. If anything, I wish there had have been more of them and against different BOW's, but the variation in what was there in terms of enemies was good.\nI bought Revelations on sale, and having played it, I probably wouldn't pay the $40 or whatever they are asking for it at the moment, but for anything under $15 it's great value. There's an arena-style multiplayer element to it as well, but after playing Dead Island I'd had my fill of that, so didn't explore it too much. I'm keen to see how Capcom plans to put this series back in the Survival Horror genre, and really aplaud them on splitting Revelations from the other Resident Evil mainstream titles (which they plan to keep as action games), in order to give fans like me what they have been asking for repeatedly after Resident Evil: Nemesis.","September 30, 2014","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Aside from a few characters (Jill, and Chris) and a few organizations mentioned (BSAA, Umbrella), everything is wholly original making this game a good standalone for those curious about the franchise. The story is all about spies, bio-terrorism, counter-terrorism, and attempts to go into some interesting psychology behind the villain's motivations but it falls a little flat. The story is told with that same goofy, almost-not-b-movie quality that has become the staple flavor for the series, and for a tale spanning countries with some really fun twists and turns that tone works surprisingly well. Couple that with the game's episodic chapters and it feels like you're watching a low-budget TV show from the 90s, and it's great.\n\nThe gameplay really isn't anything too different than the rest of the series. It has an over the shoulder, third person perspective, shooting certain points on enemies will weaken them and allow you to melee them to great effect (I still think that Chris's fists are more powerful than shotgun blasts). For the majority of the campaign you have an AI partner following you around, ala RE5, except this partner doesn't need your healing items or ammo and can't be controlled by another player, which is actually an improvement for this game. Despite it's similarities to 5, the game actually made me frightened, which only the first game (the Gamecube remake) managed to do. The atmosphere is very well set up, and one of the main locations in the game requires back tracking, but it's done so well you feel like you're running hopelessly in circles. The most frightening, and challenging, part of the game actually has you search for a dead comrade, only to find she has been resurrected as a disgusted squid-mutant-lady, and you then have to hunt her throughout the games main setting, which is a creepy, derelict boat that sways slowly beneath your feet. This moment is when the game really, truly shines as you never know when she's going to pop out and scream in a girlish voice, "found you!" Unfortunately the rest of the game is nowhere near as scary, but it is a lot more tense than any of the resident evil games after the REmake and RE0.\n\nMy disappointments in the game are minor, but still important. After defeating the squid-mutant-lady, non of the game's bosses are particularly challenging, but they are still fun to overcome. However the final boss made me so mad, because he requires almost no strategy to overcome, just a bit of quick timing, he has way too much health, and the fight just drags on. It was not fun for me, some people may enjoy it, but I didn't. Another complaint is that the game is a port from the Nintendo 3DS, which is actually quite amazing the 3DS could handle this game, but it shows. It's supposed to be an HD remake, and some textures are bumped up to a higher quality, but a lot aren't, and some of the level geometry gets blocky, and the "hidden" loading screens consist of doors with spinning wheels, you try to open the door, the wheel spins, and boom you go through. It sounds like a quick and easy way to get the game into small, bite sized chunks and remove loading screens, but I once had a door refuse to open for nearly five minutes (yes, I timed it) and ever since then I would groan when I realized my objective was on the other side of one of those blasted doors.\n\nOverall, this game is really good. I had a ton of fun with it, and despite it's few shortcomings it really is a fun game, I would recommend to anyone who wants a scary Resident Evil, and I would recommend for people curious about the series.\n\nOn a scale of:  1) Avoid like the plague 2) Maybe you'll like it? 3) Not bad 4) Good 5) Amazeballs\nThis game would be a: 4) Good.","December 11, 2014","true","14.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Capcom, THIS is a Resident Evil game done right. To be fair though, I didn't mind RE6, or even ORC for that matter, but I'm probably in the minority here. Anyway, all the stuff that a fan of classic resident evil wants is here: excellent pacing, horrific tension, limited supplies (kind of) and all the cheesy dialogue the writers at Capcom could shove in here. I say kind of limited supplies, because you're given a scanner-gun very early on that allows you to scan enemies to create Green Herbs. The way it works though, is that if an enemy is already dead and you go to scan them, you'll get a minimal amount of points towards your herbage. If you scan a still-living enemy you'll get a load more points. You can also use the scanner to find handprints (RE games always have collectibles and, uh, this is it?) and secret pick-ups.\nThe gameplay is pretty much the same from RE4, but it's obviously a little bit more up to date. It feels familiar but fresh. The game also allows you to choose between aiming in first, or third person. I played with the first person aim and loved it. Give it a shot if you haven't, it's a whole different experience.\nThe story was pretty solid, for a fairly cheesy one. And I personally enjoyed all the nods♥♥♥♥♥♥ences to Dante Alighieri's Divina Comedia which I myself have read and very much enjoyed. However, that mission with the 2 random dudes that hold absolutely no weight whatsoever in the story? Kinda felt like padding, and it takes away from the almost perfect pacing of the game. I didn't mind switching between multiple protagonists, but those 2 goons were just, well, goons.\nThe game also has a co-op mode that I had put a handful of hours into. It's fun with strangers but even more fun with friends. It feels very different from the single player in the sense that enemies now have a health-bar, and power levels. If you've ever played Borderlands you'll get the grasp of it very quickly. There are tons of different guns to collect, including super rare/unique weapons. You can also modify your weapons with a plethora of different parts in single player and in Co-op.\nDefinitely pick up this game if you're an old fan of the series, but if you're new and looking for a solid entry point, go with RE4. And if you're interested in playing RE4 and aren't a graphics nazi, I highly recommend the Wii version. Best controls of all the versions I've played.","February 18, 2015","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I did a bit of research on the game and found out it was a mobile game port, so wasn't really expecting much.\n\nHowever I was pleasantly surprised how it reminded me of old school Resident Evil games I used to play on the Playstation back in the 90s. I actually enjoyed playing this game a lot, and have had some good co-op fun with it.\n\nThe game starts off quite easy, but the harder difficulties are more challenging .. so it is probably worth starting the campaign off on Normal or Infernal difficulty. The story is reasonably good and keeps you going to see what happens next.\n\nRaid mode (the actual Co-Op part of the game) is a blast as you progress through the difficulties. I just wish that it was possible to do the campaign Co-Op like Resident Evil 5, I have no idea why they did not include this feature, maybe it would have made the campaign too easy .. who knows.\n\nLack of Co-Op campaign is really the only big downside to this game, so if you enjoy blasting BOWs with your friends at least you have RAID mode.\n\nRecommended.","November 14, 2014","true","34.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are a number of artifacts that remind you of this being a handheld port -- the episodic format mainly, but poor textures as well -- but this a step back towards RE4; less action, more survival horror.  Well, maybe not horror.  Nothing in this is scary, per se.  The weapon customization is excellent, and this game's arcade/mercenaries mode (called raid mode) is suprisingly good, being what I can only describe as a mini-campaign.  Raid mode is multiplayer if you want, the campaign is single player with an AI partner you'll barely notice because he does nothing and I'm pretty sure can't die at all.  The story is awful, but that's Resident Evil for you.  If you can get it on sale and liked RE4, you literally can't go wrong with this.","June 1, 2013","true","31.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The monsters ignore your AI partner and go directly for you, and your AI partner does not do a thing.

The only real reason i would recommend this, is because i love the Resident evil universe. If you're not a fan of the series, don't even go there.\n\nStarting off with the good parts. The story is rather decent. The characters are as lovely as ever and the not-completely-linier-except-it-is idea is a fun diversion from the regularity in most RE games.\nI also liked the weapon upgrade system, gives a more changey feel and all choices are not permanent.\n\nNow to the bad parts, the *WEAPON UPGRADE SYSTEM* is not permanent and feels weird for a RE game...\n\nThe *GRAPHICS* are sad, not as in bad but it gives a kindof dead feeling. The lighting is lighting up whole cupboards like it's a semi-budgettey game from the late 2000s. All textures who are about to move are semi-obvious to completely obvious.\n\nThe game suffers from *EXTREME CONSOLITIES*. The graphics is one of the clues, the other is the aiming. Even though we remove the aim-help, it's still jumpy, You can't aim properly when you're getting close to a monster couse even though it's turned off, the aim-help seems to kick and and prevents any fast or small movements of the aim.\n\nTHERE ARE NO REAL ZOMBIES! Just lots of weird blobby humanoids who are no fun trying to aim at with their wobbly heads and ♥♥♥♥ed up aiming.\n\nThere are *NO SCARY SCENES* where you know you're about to get ♥♥♥♥ed but still try to make it out with key-combinations, even though the rest of the game is console-oriented, this part which is usually the more fun, and mostly hated, part of the RE games IMHO, is left out.\n\n*IT'S PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DODGE* it makes no sence that you have to time a turnabout to dodge, and you almost always dodge straight into whatever's trying to run into you.\n\nBut i still played through the whole campaign, and i actually enjoyed it. So the story is a pretty big plus, even though i am quite sure most people will not agree with me on that part. There are quite a few things that does not make sence, RE wise, but i suppose it's still legit. I want to believe.","September 18, 2014","true","10.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Anyways...\n\nResident Evil Revelations is known for taking the series back to its survival horror roots, which it actually does. Although, I still prefer Resident Evil 4 (which I'll also have to try checking out the PC version of), but this is probably my 2nd favorite in the franchise.\n\nThere's a bunch of plot twists, the enemies are sometimes decently challenging. I say sometimes since the 3DS version made me so used to standing while shooting, so this version feels like a walk in a park to me, except in that part where you have no weapons. Speaking fo which, I don't remember that B.O.W. being able to get its head out of the TV in the original version. Unless it was always like that and I'm just really fast when it comes to getting out of the room usually, nice touch.\n\nThe gameplay mainly has a system of primary weapons (guns), secondary weapons (explosives), and a dodge system which is easily abused when you know what you're doing. I'm still a bit rusty at the dodging since I haven't used it in so long, but you can generally just move forward real quick with the right timing and completely avoid all damage.\n\nAmmo is scarce and enemies refuse to die, reserve ammo for when you need it. Either that, or just head shot everything. You could also knife everything or use your bombs. Yeah, those bombs have saved my lives many times. Especially the B.O.W. Decoys. Also, some bosses are down-right frightening at first. They aren't as scary the 2nd time through, though.....Except for the Com's Officer, he stops being scary for a while and then he shows you why you were scared with a nice chainsaw to the pelvis while a horde of undead fish people are coming to get you.

But even so, RE4 still felt like a step in another direction; a more action-oriented direction, which would later turn out be true, because of RE5 and RE6. But, here comes Revelations, a game originally released between RE5 and RE6, that takes a step backwards for the better, back to the classic style of Resident Evil, when the series was more about survival horror and atmospheric settings. And I can wholeheartedly say, that Revelations is quite possibly the best Resident Evil game I've played.\n\nI was initially doubtful about playing Revelations, due to my general dislike of the direction the series had gone, and I thought that Revelations took the same direction as well. But boy was I wrong this whole time. Revelations takes the formula that made RE such a famous series within the horror genre, while at the same time improving the controls, making it far more accessible to newcomers, or people who hate the "tank controls" and/or the fixed camera angles. It drops having to manage your inventory and worrying about space (apart from selecting at maximum three weapons to take with you.) And an improvement over RE5 is that you don't have to take care of your AI partner anymore. And not to mention that it features a story that is kept seperate from the numbered games' plot, allowing it to stand more on its own, without relying too heavily on the other games - which is really interesting, since it's told in an Episodic nature, like a TV show, a first in the series.\n\nIf you've played the latest RE games and you've felt doubtful in that it'll ever return to its glory days, or if you've had a dislike of how the RE games controls, then look no further. I highly recommend you try this game, because it's the best Resident Evil in years. Hell, I'd even recommend newcomers to start with this game, since it does not have the things that the majority of dislikers complain about.\n\nEnemies are frightening again, ammo is limited again, darkness is back again, free-roaming is (partly) back again, jumpscares are back again, eerie atmospheres are back again, a secluded setting is back again, and most importantly: Resident Evil has come back again!","September 21, 2014","true","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are a number of artifacts that remind you of this being a handheld port -- the episodic format mainly, but poor textures as well -- but this a step back towards RE4; less action, more survival horror.  Well, maybe not horror.  Nothing in this is scary, per se.  The weapon customization is excellent, and this game's arcade/mercenaries mode (called raid mode) is suprisingly good, being what I can only describe as a mini-campaign.  Raid mode is multiplayer if you want, the campaign is single player with an AI partner you'll barely notice because he does nothing and I'm pretty sure can't die at all.  The story is awful, but that's Resident Evil for you.  If you can get it on sale and liked RE4, you literally can't go wrong with this.","June 1, 2013","true","31.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The controls are much better suited to action style than even the RE4 set, and I wish RE4 HD had an option to use Revelations controls. Side stepping, moving while reloading, it just feels more natural.\n\nTwo things don't quite work however. The dodge mechanic is awful. Luckily you never need it because of the fluid movement system. The second is your handy item detector / enemy scanner. It works fine but is clunky and breaks of the action a bit, but it is satisfying to sweep a room and grab new items. Scanning enemies however wasn't as fun and would have been better off with a Bioshock earn bonuses system. Instead RE Revelations just adds a % per enemy scanned to a meter and when you hit 100% you get a health item. Useful but not engaging.\n\nTwo other things that stand out to me as complaints I've seen against the game. Variety of enemies and Graphics. There were just as many enemies as RE4 if not more honestly, because the difference between the cultists and villagers was clothing, and as for the Graphics I found that when when everything was put at the highest the game looked really nice. I liked the creature designs quite a bit actually.","September 11, 2014","true","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I picked it up while it was on sale after trying the demo, wasn't sure how much mileage I would get out of my purchase. But RESIDENT EVIL REVELATIONS is a solid title in the franchise.\n\nThough the gameplay is a bit hindered somewhat by the clunky dodge mechanic, it plays quite well; it's not as complicated as Resident Evil 6's gameplay mechanics, but is just as smooth, allowing you to strafe and move while aiming, and completely eliminates the need to menu surf for items. However, as I previously mentioned, the new dodge mechanic is clunky at best; to dodge an attack you have to move forward or back at a precise time to duck under a swing. It wouldn't be such a problem if a couple major bosses didn't rely so heavily on dodging. Otherwise you might find yourself crushed into a Jill sandwich.\n\nGameplay aside, the story is entertaining albeit predictable. Roughly half the characters are well written and performed, but several new characters are quite badly done and can grate against the player's nerves.\nThe atmosphere, though, is harrowing and claustrophobic, and the musical score is great.\n\nSeveral episodes in the game come up a little short, but I finished the game feeling satisfied.\nI recommend to survival horror and Resident Evil fans to give RESIDENT EVIL REVELATIONS a try.","April 10, 2015","true","11.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Let me first state that I am, indeed, one of those purists that thinks RE1 was the pinacle of the franchise, and that the decision to move away from fixed camera angles really took something of the dread away from every corner and corridoor you couldn't quite see the end of. With that out of the way and taken as a given, Revelations is a good action game. Good, not great, good.\nLet's get the bad stuff out of the way shall we? As an action game, the controls don't really cut it in comparison to other fast-paced action titles. Strafing is a little too slow, particularly for those of us who are used to using strafe to get around corners, and made me feel like I was driving a fire engine rather than an athlete in a cat suit. The bindings are an improvement on previous games, but I still found myself modifying them to match "the norm". There was a distinct lack of hoard activity, which is something I discovered while playing Revelations, that I have come to take for granted since RE2, and was a little confused in the end as to why they were not implemented. What they have done to Hunters also made me shed a tear, and I can only assume it was in order to make dodging have a reason to be included.\nOn to the good stuff! By an absolute country mile, the best thing about Revelations is the story, as you would expect from a long-running franchise. The plot twists and cut scenes were great, and were just as much part of the game as the gameplay itself. Playing as other characters to fill out the story didn't feel like a chore as it does in a lot of games, and I think the key to that is taking the RPG element out of it, and rather focussing on gun modification instead. Kitting said characters out in a somewhat OP fashion always helps though. I thought the inclusion of the "Last time on..." cut scenes after loading a save (and the ability to make them go away too - I'm looking at you AMC) was a great inclusion, especially if I hadn't played for a couple of days. Pretty much the only saving grace for Revelations, as an action game, were the boss fights. If anything, I wish there had have been more of them and against different BOW's, but the variation in what was there in terms of enemies was good.\nI bought Revelations on sale, and having played it, I probably wouldn't pay the $40 or whatever they are asking for it at the moment, but for anything under $15 it's great value. There's an arena-style multiplayer element to it as well, but after playing Dead Island I'd had my fill of that, so didn't explore it too much. I'm keen to see how Capcom plans to put this series back in the Survival Horror genre, and really aplaud them on splitting Revelations from the other Resident Evil mainstream titles (which they plan to keep as action games), in order to give fans like me what they have been asking for repeatedly after Resident Evil: Nemesis.","September 30, 2014","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game plays out like the very first Resident Evil, with lots of surprises and twists. The combat mechanic is solid, fun and engaging. The whole "out in the ocean" was a great setting choice and one that the horror market really needed. Thumbs up for this one and lets hope the next RE follows in its steps.","December 2, 2013","true","15.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
