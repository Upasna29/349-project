Imagine a 3x3 grid, with an obstacle in the middle. Each turn, you play two cards into that grid. No, it's not Tic Tac Toe, bear with me. Each card represents a supply route, an attack range, and a support fire range. The supply route dictates where you can play, you must keep a supply chain from your side of the base to where you seek to play. If the card has an attack range that overlaps an enemy card when you play, and you have another card's support range overlapping that card, you can attack with that placement, destroying an enemy card. You can only attack along with placing a card.\n\nThat is the game. You try to capture the other player's side of the base, and you are jockeying for position. Only two card plays per turn, yes, but these are two incredibly stressful plays where you and your opponent are engaged in a proverbial knife fight in a phone booth, trying to wreck each other's placements and advance as best you can with each play, trying to squeeze every ounce of firepower you can out of these two simple plays. Because, really, you're only three cards from the opponent's base at all times, and it is incredibly easy to forget that if you try to advance up one side and leave the opponent with one card on the table.\n\nThe game itself runs fine. Only played AI but the AI is solid. Online play is on offer, in the mobile sense of you make a move and wait for the opponent to sign back in and make a move, which absolutely murders the pace of the game on PC but works just fine for mobile. The rules link just goes to a PDF at the official site. The digital implementation feels a little bare bones, but there is not much to complain about beyond that; you have music, decent thematic animations...\n\nAll in all, this is an incredibly smart and challenging card game that can be played in under 5 minutes","June 2","true","0.6"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","13","15","2","0"
