Yes, I do not have put a lot of time in it (but I will) but it plays smoothly. It's fun and you get more than enough fun for it's very cheap price. I will expand my review after I played a lot more.\n\nAlso, I do not understand negative reviews because people just don't like the graphics. Graphics are not that bad and the game is almost a steal at it's retail price. If you want top tier graphics buy fallout 4 for 2800% the price of this game. Just my 2 cents. :-)","May 5","true","3.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","2"

I knew from the very beginning "Caveman World: Mountains of Unga Boonga" was going to be ♥♥♥♥. Hell, the average consumer would be able to gather that assumption after watching the trailers provided on the store page. Like, holy BALLS is this game bad. The standard walkspeed is atrociously slow, and that coupled with the fact that you can't  jump worth a camel's ♥♥♥ without having your pinkie glued to the shift button foces you to sprint throughout 95% of the game (this is only an assumption, I have only played five minutes of this game). On top of that, the developer(s?) of this game decided to take advantage of simple prop physics and integrate them into a mechanic, aka "log jumps" (these are showcased in one of the two trailers). It's honestly one of the laziest game mechanics I've ever c u c k i n g seen. The game is, however, $3, and if you're wanting to laugh at your own self-pity for a minute and a half I'd say it's worth a buy.","April 27","false","0.4"," 16 of 30 people (53%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","53","16","30","5","0"

There is nothing about this game that can make me recommend it above most of it's peers. It looks pretty bad, feels kind of strange when it comes to the controls and half of the time seems purely nonsensical. Because of all of this, i can find no argument to use your money or time on this game when you have so many other much better choices out there.

This is a game that everyone can play if they want to cause there are nothing that should be inapropiet for kids in my opinion.\nIn this world you're a caveman with a bone club that he does not use to attack with. You can not kill anything in this game, but your object is to get home, collect things ranging from seashells, meat or fruit, but you can also crush eggs in some levels. The collecting and crushing is optional. You can get 3 stars at each level, there are 3 episodes and 9 levels in each episode giving you 27 episodes. You can use 5 stars to buy extra hearts and extra energy, you start with 3 hearts and 3 seconds energy.\nEnemys in this game have a 180 turning angle and they will flit at the drop of a hat. Mammoths, dinosaurs, bugs and more are your enemy variations. Each attack will take 1 heart from you and if you lose them all then you need to do that level from the begining. Fire, pitfalls, lifts and  automatic spikes will also try to kill you. The 2 lights beside eachother are you checkpoints. If you get sent back to the checkpoint after being attacked or not seems to be up to random chance.\nThe graphics aren't that good, there is no story apart from get home to your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ family that isen't helping you while collecting optional stuff on your way and the soundtrack is repetetive. The 7th level in the 3rd chapter the hardest in the game thanks to 2 hard jumps, unlike the end of the game, other then that this is kind of a easy game. The controll aren't as responsive as I would have liked and the trailer for this game showed it in a much better graphical light then what we got even at the best graphics it didn't look that good. There are no achievements, but there are badges. If you stand still then the caveman will saw different caveman and dinosaur puns that are cheesy at best, but there is no voice acting in this one so the puns are in text bobbles.\nIf these things turn you off then I advice you to not buy this, or buy it to check it out for yourself. Good Luck and Have Fun :) Ugh Bugh.","May 4","false","6.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

It may be extremely cheap, but, really, there is nothing here that makes this game good in ANY aspect\n\nThe game looks bad, which is not really a problem, but it also plays bad. The mechanics are pretty bad and don't really make any sense.\n\nI mean, you're supposed to hold shift to run or jump farther. Yet, you have a stamina bar. Yet, your stamina bar will probably never empty, because each time you collect a "collectible" (a cute name for a fruit, I guess) you fill a bit (a lot) of your bar. Also, if you stay still you also will fill your stamina bar pretty quickly. That makes the stamina bar completely useless.\n\nThe enemies here are really ridiculous, also. They're huge and hard to avoid (and to see, because the camera does not help sometimes)\n\nYou should avoid this, there is no reason to go into this game.","May 3","false","2.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"
