It is the first early access game on steam. A game that has been in a state of early access for 4 years and 8 months(April 1st, 2011) and no sign of ever going gold. In fact, it has been so long since it's last update that it has almost been as long since it was updated as the offical launch of early access games on steam. If Valve had taken a look at how early access worked for this game I doubt they would have ever allowed any early access games on steam. Why any game that has not been updated in over two years without being formally released is allowed to stay avalible to customers to purchase is beyond me.\n\nTruthfully, it's not a horrible game but it is far from great. Most of my hours came from stress testing a video card. This game would cause crashes more often then any other I owned at the time. The rest came from the 2011 potato thingy for portal 2 launch. If your a fan of games that use your own music to generate levels I would recommend a bunch of others others over this one. Even Dejobann's other game AAAAaaaAAaaAAaaaaAAAA!!!!! does the concept much better and is more polished than this rendition. I just can't recommend this game to other people.","December 28, 2015","false","22.8"," 28 of 29 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","28","29","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ajpos/recommended/15540/","ajpos","Andy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ajpos/","483 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIntro:\n\n1...2...3... Kick It is a music game modelled after Dejobaan's earlier game, "Aaaaaa," in which the player "base jumps" and avoids a series of obstacles on their way to the ground.  This iteration is only a spiritual successor, as Dejobaan has removed many of the more action-oriented elements from their formula and has instead tried to craft a new genre of relaxing music game with only two or three core gameplay mechanics instead of the many kisses, combos, landings, and tricks we saw in "Aaaaa." The concept is much simpler now: fly close to objects to earn something called "TB," and you also get something nice if that object is oriented towards the bottom of your screen. There are no landings, tricks, combos, or crowds to show off to. Because the game is STILL IN PROGRESS, I am trying to be as fair as possible. Please understand that any of the bullet points below may be changed or improved by the time you are reading this.\n\nThe Good:\n\n* The graphics are visually interesting, but there is still room for improvement. I imagine a music game should have something more than plain black backgrounds.\n\n* The Game is constantly updated.\n\n* Interesting and well-developed soundtrack. I am not super into music but I thought the lyrics and beats were fun to listen to.\n\n* The developers are some of the nicest people in the world. Drop by the Steam community forums and see for yourself: they respond to every bug, glitch, and criticism with poise and patience.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n* Not all updates are good. For example, it used to have a nice voiceover AI in the menus, which for some reason was replaced by silence in the latest update. Silent menu screens? In a previous build, I was unable to load any actual levels due to the way the game saves music.\n\n* The full-screen is not working at the time of this writing. It opens a window large enough to fill my screen, but there is still the familiar Windows 7 title bar at the top.\n\nThe Ugly:\n\n* There is nothing that I can see to qualify this as a music game. Some obstacles will "pulse" with the beat of the music, but everything else in the level seems to be pre-scripted. I can listen to Dolly Parton or speed metal while playing and get the same experience. My recommendation for the Developers would be to replace the black background with something colorful that responds to the music.\n\n* The free-falling mechanic is just not that interesting or immersive like it was in Dejobaan's first game (which was not very immersive to begin with). This feels more like a rail-shooter than a falling simulator. There is no rush of wind passing my ears, no way to slow or speed my descent, and absolutely nothing to remind me that I am falling down instead of running sideways or flying upwards.\n\nConclusion:\n\nBecause the game is still in development at the time of this writing, I think this review (and any others) should be read in that context. Unfortunately, at this stage of development, I never-the-less foresee "1...2...3... Kick It" as being noteworthy just for coming alphabetically in your list of games, and not for the enjoyable time you spend playing it.","December 15, 2013","false","0.9"," 39 of 48 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","39","48","0","0"

I've repeatedly contacted Dejobaan but have received nothing but lies (they claimed it was a priority but have released four other titles in the interim) and mocking shrugs (along the lines of "gee, we can't please all of the people all of the time"). Valve refuse to refund despite their complicitness in promoting it during a 2011 sale.\n\nThis is a total scam and should be avoided at all costs.

KICK IT! is a rhythm/skydiving game. It's AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! but the level design is set to music.\n\nIt's permanently stuck in early access, but oddly has been developed a bit over the years. It's gone through 2 or 3 major engine rewrites, but seems to be stuck in very early development anyway. Don't buy it if you expect a 'finished' game experience.\n\nThere are a few songs made for the game, which are decent.\nYou can hand it your music library and it'll try to generate levels based on that, but the music analyzer is buggy.\n\nThat's about all I can say about it because there's not that much to do in the game. While A Reckless Disregard for Gravity had point-collecting and levels to unlock, this game can't really do that because of how random the level design is. There's no progression and no sense of achievement because the game experience varies wildly depending on the randomness of the level generator.\n\nThe difficulty is pretty pointless because there's no death or failure state, just less points than you would have had for doing well. Also, there's no rating system or metric for how well you did, just an arbitrary number (and the devs have rewritten the scoring system a few times as well). If I get a 'high' score, I don't know if I actually did well or the song was just easier than most. Often, longer songs will net you more points by default because you get a few points per second, and longer song = more time to get points.\n\nI just can't recommend the game because even though it seems like a decent concept, it doesn't have that much potential and it seems to be totally dead.\n\nTo be a game I'd recommend, it would need:\n-an entirely different music analysis/level generator that actually makes sense for the song\n-a scoring system that can tell you how well you did vs. the difficulty and length of the song\n-some way to actually progress or increase difficulty over time, some way to actually fail a song\n-something that actually makes you move with the rhythm, like osu! or audiosurf. Playing with full audio is no different from having the music muted because the music only affects the quantity of obstacles, not their placement or their difficulty.\n\nAnd if the dev team hasn't done this in the last 4-ish years it's probably not going to happen anytime soon.\n\nThe problem is that even if this game escapes 'early access' status and fixes these issues, it doesn't seem like it could ever be as fun as AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! which still makes this a game I can't recommend. It has some potential, but when compared with other rhythm games or other arcade games, it just won't compete even as a 'finished' product. AaaaaAA only works because of the fluidity and uniqueness of the level design, and if you take that away or leave it up to a music analyzer, you remove the challenge of AaaaaAA and make it repetitive because all levels have to be (about) the same.\n\nUltimately, you should only buy it if you are a die-hard Dejobaan fan for completion's sake.","November 8, 2014","false","3.3"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","27","30","0","0"

I loved the other games Dejobaan have made in the past, and I was curious to see what they would do with Ugly Baby, so I was eager to pick it up. I didn't mind it being in early access since I had faith in their abilities to create a game (especially after Aaaaaaah), and it was one of the reasons that the Potato Sack from 2011 worked so well. There was a lot of good potential there.\n\nIt's been a few years now, and there's still nothing here but an incomplete game.

Do you wish it was easier? Do you wish there was less to do? Do you wish the cool level names were replaced with "City #"?

Then hoOooOooOOOooO BOY you're in for a real treat here.\n\nThis game has been "in progress" or whatever for two years and here's the entire gameplay experience:\n\n1) Pick level. If you pick the first two levels, skip to #5. If you pick the third level, skip to #4.\n2) Wait for the file browser to load. For whatever damn idiot reason, the game decides to scan the ID3v2 tags, which means that just displaying a single album's worth of songs can take about thirty seconds, and if you have one folder full of music then you're in for a real doozy of a wait.\n3) Pick a song you want to listen to.\n4) Wait about a minute for the game to load the level.\n5) Use the mouse to move around the level. Use the mouse buttons to rotate your field of view.\n5a) If a tall building is on the bottom of your field of view, your multiplier goes up and you get about 5 points per tick.\n5b) If you pass within range of a small building asteroid field, you get (100 x M) points per small building, where M = your current multiplier.\n5c) Occasionally the colors pulse, and for about 10% of songs you may notice the buildings being "built" around you at roughly the same pace as the beat.\n6) Collect your score and your "followers" (score / 1,000). Followers can be used for lots of things, such as "absolutely nothing".\n7) After you unlock the first four levels, the game really opens up, as now you can play the fifth city in any order you wish.\n8) There are only five "levels" in the game and three of them are various forms of simplified tutorials.\n\nTwo years of "early access" for this. Oh and they just opened up the scripting editor, so you can muck about there and maybe the game will build a spiral ramp in response to a certain portion of a song instead of a building asteroid field. Or maybe not.\n\nNot sure if there were more levels at an earlier stage of the game, but considering the leaderboards are entirely empty I'm willing to believe the people with the "beat level 15" achievement just used an Achievement Manager.\n\nOn the plus side, "Future Shock" is a really good song and whoever does the voiceover may well be the only chick in the history of indie games to actually know how to read lines without sounding like a terrified dyslexic shut-in with a gun to her head.

I then realized that what I had bought was a very, very early just playable version with few different levels.\n\nBy now, time has passed and Dejobaan have release several other games, but this one is still stuck in development hell. I'd love to see a full version once and I appreciate the engine migration and all the stuff that happened since the potato sack like a few additional stages, but a full version is due since a very long time ago.\n\nWhen the full version is out, I'll properly review the game again.","May 17, 2015","false","2.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The game feels much closer to some amateur's experimental project in programming than to a real, sellable product.\n\nThe gameplay itself revolves around falling through a level that's based on some techno song that plays in the background, while trying to avoid obstacles and hit little targets. Like I said, the concept gets old quickly, and you'll find little to no variety when falling through the same geometrical obstacles and trying to align yourself with the targets.\n\nImho, there are much better rhythm games, and even better, games that let you use your own song library, so if you're looking for something like that, I recommend you look around instead of getting this one.\n\nSince I got this in the Potato Sack, quite a while ago, I don't feel that much ripped off but, seriously, I feel bad for whoever bought this from the store.","July 21, 2015","false","1.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

This game is probably my largest disappointment.  They grew bored of the concept and abandoned it and the promise it had.  I like the idea of games generated by the music playing, and it's successfully executed elsewhere, but, not here.  It boils down to the fact that while this game exists, it's here, and it doesn't SUCK, it's not worth grabbing because there's no further promise to the game and it's really not all that finished.","January 17","false","0.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I decided to give it ago to farm some trading cards after this has been in my library for a year or longer. It is in Early Acc..wait what? A game released years ago is in Early Access? Yeah, it is. I didn't quite believe it until I saw the stamp on the store page and the multiple reviews and discussion threads referencing. Many players feel the developers are abusing the Early Access status as an excuse for the game "being worked on" and not up to people's quality standards. Yet, Steam users report that the game hasn't been updated in over a year, so the developer is definitely doing some thing shady. While I don't care enough about this game to feel like I was scammed, I would probably advise most people to not buy this game despite the game in my experience feeling solid and semi-enjoyable enough to be played and possibly beaten. I don't honestly think the game is bad, but the player/customer experience is heavily damaged by the developer's strange behavior.\n\nAnother strange factor is that apparently this game has been redone multiple times. The game I remember seeing from videos years ago (even from a 4 year old video on the Developer's own Youtube channel!) is vastly different from what the game is now. I have no idea if it is better or worse, but it's strange to see a game have a completely different art style and game mechanics from it's release.\n\nFor the most part, gameplay is like an endless runner or a rhythm game played in first person as if you are sky diving around large shapes. Levels have different requirments such as getting enough points by getting close to objects, collecting items, hacking flashing objects by pressing a button while near the object or flying through a open object as if threading a needle. It's a rather simplistic game, but I think it generally works well for what it does, just it doesn't do too much. Some levels are based on specific tracks and other allow you to choose from a list a songs - you should be able to load your own music as well, but I've read at one person mentioning issues with loading custom music.\n\nI think this game is rather alright, though probably a bad purchase due to developer scumbaggery. Fans of the other Dejoban games often recommend the other AAAaaaAA! falling score attacks games versus this one, so I would look into those first if this game piques your interest.","December 13, 2014","false","1.6"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

The concept is good and the mechanics are decent, but it lacks the intensity (and difficulty) that I'd expect (and want) from this kind of game.  If they finally update this to something a bit better I'll be glad to come back and give it a shot, but as it stands now, I couldn't recommend this for purchase.","June 5, 2014","false","1.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You basically got to play "AaAaAA" with your own music that proceedurally generated the level. Which was awesome! It was a small difference, but one that made the two games totally different.\n\nThey eventually killed that option in the original game (through updates/patches, nerfing features, until the ONLY important gameplay difference between AaAaAA and 123KI  was simply the control scheme), in order to re-sell this "new concept," which is basically a graphics update of something they released years ago.\n\nI'm OK with them re-selling an update/re-boot to the original, which was honestly very inexpensive (and often freeware) when released. Kickass, I'd totally be on board with paying $20 for an improved sequel of a great game that I originally got for free/$1/$9.99. But patching my *owned* game to remove functionality, options, and basic gameplay (the ability to integrate my own music with a level, THE REASON WHY I GOT THE GAME TO BEGIN WITH, AND THE REASON WHY MANY PEOPLE GOT IT, THEIR INTEREST BEING A REASON WHY THE DEV IS STILL BE AROUND TODAY...)\n\n...that's just a fkng ♥♥♥♥ move.\n\nI obviously have many mixed emotions about this.

Dejobaan have clearly lavished a lot of time on the interface.  The game is also totally different from the pre-alpha... Gone seem to be the crazy music-video like spirally tentacles and psychadelic backgrounds.. They've been replaced with lots of flashing and pulsing cubes.\n\nThe other major plusses for this new version are the radio voiceovers which are amusing, the music which is not too bad, and the controls which feel very fluid.  the "city map" screen is enigmatic in its inscrutibility... I can seem to play any of the "levels".. so why are they linked, as if it's some kind of progression?  What do any of the descriptions mean?  What's the benefit of playing any one level?\n\nThe answer, it seems, is "none of it makes a blind bit of difference".   All the levels look, feel, sound and play the same, except for a few which seem to be cut-scenes.\n\nSadly, the game is missing any form of coherence whatsoever.  I so dearly want to love this game. I really enjoy Audiosurf, but that has no pretence of being a "game".. just a "ride your music" simulator.\n\nWhat does 1..2..3 need?  Well, it needs a single-player game for starters:  Let the player play the game using pre-determined music to begin with.  Make it nice and easy.. fun.. like it used to be.. before they added the "three strikes and your out" annoyance.  Once you're through, and have cracked the game using the pre-determined scores and music, open it up.. Let people play whatever.. like Audiosurf..   Add a *POINT* to the game.. you're a spy, trying to scan for agents.. or you're trying to find someone.. any point to "scanning" would be good, rather than just point scoring...\n\nTo be honest, I couldn't be bothered with this new version.  It's a real shame because Dejobaan have clearly tried to salvage it from it's pre-alpha state.  Sadly, it's missed the mark a little.   I haven't got time to put all my music through this to see what makes a "fun" level, because I doubt that any of the levels are truly "fun", now that you've got the rule that "hit three things and you're dead".\n\nI have an urge to create a boring 1hr long MIDI track with a single note, and AFK-ride that note from the comfort of in front of the telly, returning to see I'd scored the highest score ever..  But it's just not worth it.\n\nI still can't give this a thumbs-up, despite the fact it's oh-so-close to being awesome.  Sorry, Dejobaan.","January 25, 2015","false","3.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

So now the game goes from a full retail game and gets put into "Early Access". I'm still not really sure how it's even legal to sell an incomplete game and have it slip past and get thrown on the Steam store to make money.\n\nThe game has gotten a complete makeover and went from a game about playing music and falling through a stage collecting a score and shooting...well...nothing, you see they gave you a gun to shoot stuff but because it was never finished there was nothing to shoot. The gun has since been removed and now the game is nothing more than a screen saver that plays your music.\n\nNow the whole point of the game is to fly through a stage and get as close to an object to gain a score but you need to avoid making any kind of contact with it or you get hit, but don't worry because you can't die... I'm not really sure the developers even know what they want the game to be or what they're trying to go for. Any other music driven game knows what it wants to do and it does it well, this game on the other hand doesn't and in fact if you really wanted you could load up a song and just let go of the mouse and the level will complete itself with no assistance needed.\n\nIf you want a game with absolutely no objective and no real reason to exist then this is the game for you, but if you actually want a game for your money then avoid this game at all costs.","November 26, 2013","false","1.2"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","9","18","0","0"

(It's been roughly 2 years now, I think)\n\nAnd that may explain why I felt the way I did during the x amount of time I spent on it to get the cards. The game is fun, but it feels like it's missing something. For one thing, it needs some kind of indicator to show what unlocks the next city (unless I'm an idiot and just missed it), because I have no idea how. The first few cities unlocked after doing the prior city once, and then when I hit city 5, the next one didn't unlock, and I was like "huh?". After doing it 2 more times, it did, but I have no idea what I did differently.\n\nThen, the core of the gameplay itself feels like it's just lacking something in general. As far as I could tell, it's impossible to fail. You just fly through the city, avoiding the blocks. You use your mouse to move, and left/right click to rotate yourself. And that's... about it. At this point, it's more like a little stress reliever than an actual game.\n\nI'd say it's worth picking up if it goes on sale to $2 or $3, but not any higher, but for now I'll remain optimistic that, in time, it'll be super duper awesome.","August 19, 2013","false","2.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Dejobaan released an unfinished, buggy, short rhythm game based on their 2009 release, "A Reckless Disregard for Gravity". With very few maps, indistinguishable beat-matching, and recycled gameplay elements, the devs dropped this game to work on other projects only to "release" it again in 2013 thanks to the Early Access system.\n\nAlthough this game has improved (thanks to more income by being put to the top of the Early Access section of the store), it's still an incomplete, shallow, rhythmless mess that still isn't worth playing 2 years later.","November 29, 2013","false","1.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alantryth/recommended/15540/","alantryth","Alan Tryth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alantryth/","553 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThere's something about this series that I find strangely relaxing; soaring through the sky, twirling around buildings ... similar to Mirror's Edge in feel, in that there is a genuine feeling of height and falling that is just oddly cathartic to me. I'd love to see this incorporated in another game; perhaps a way to make fast travel feel less like point and click and more like travelling fantastical distances (I've always felt like my character in Bethesda Games is doing a Megaman-esque beam up whenever I fast travel). This installment brings with it full mouse control, which I find to be very tight and easy to master, the ability to use your own tracks on some levels (Yes, I used Megalovania and Arachnophilia), and an interesting character in Asumi.\n\nThat said, this game has been in Early Access for quite a while, and I think I know why. As much as I like this, it does feel very much the same, and I think the developers know that and are trying to find new ways to mix up the formula. Now, I for one don't mind more of the same; I've already run through all the levels on the other games and like the idea of using my own music to mix things up again (Hopes and Dreams, people). If I had to throw in a criticism, though, the levels where I could use my own music didn't have as much level variety as I would've liked. I also echo the same sentiment as many; a free-fall option where you aren't stopped after three hits would be nice.\n\nSo do I recommend this?  I'm gonna go with a very tenative yes, with a suggestion that you pick up one of the others first if you're a prospective new player and wait and see if the project has truly been abandoned before putting more than a dollar of your money up for this title in particular. I sincerely hope this isn't the case; with VR already descending on the video game industry, this (along with the previous games) is one of the titles that makes me want to plunk down the cash to see where Asumi's story takes her.","May 11","true","2.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Voice-acting is great. Available music is awesome, should you not want to play with your own tracks. Levels have a hypnotizing effect similar to Windows Visualizations, falling through with artfully-rendered worlds. Scores are gratifying.\n\nCONS: Some levels go too fast for comfort, spending more time constantly dodging than racking up points is less hectic and more uncomfortable. Levels compiled with custom music in mind can sometimes be a bit unpolished, understandably-so.\n\nOVERALL: This is a fun addition to the Dejobaan collection, but it's clear why it's in Early Access.

More than IRL, but you're more than free to try and play it that way.\n\nUsed to be you could hit until your meter thing ran out...so if you kept it up you could get the feel of the level while smaking crap.

Couple this with the visceral tie of the gameplay to the music being played at the same time and it's just amazing.\n\nAt the moment though, it doesn't accept the full range of formats (and maybe doesn't at all) that Audiosurf and the like will accept, but the 15 or so tunes packed with the game are pretty awesome anyway. Also each soundtrack has multiple levels of replayability as the construction of the level depends on the "city" you've selected. So one city will have you falling through grid sections of long blocks, whilst another will be sending you weaving through cylinders punctuated by spinning fans and spokes.

You had to control your fall AND shoot enemies with cursor-based camera controls instead of your typical mouse camera controls (try to think of using Wii FPS or RTS camera controls in a normal FPS). The levels were also empty and boring.\n\nIn this new version, the controls and stages have been greatly improved. It contains proper mouse camera controls and the levels have much more objects in them, making the levels much more interesting (though don't expect these levels to always be filled with objects). The shooting mechanic has been removed, letting you focus more on your maneuvers as you fall. This is a huge improvement in my opinion because I always hated the shooting mechanic in the old beta; it always caused me to fly off-track or crash into a wall.\n\nEven though you see me praising the new version, don't expect to have a full game that'll take away hundreds of hours of your life. As of now, the game is only about falling; no special rings, plates, obstacles, or other mechanics that fit the "falling to your music" theme (but I guess the simplicity adds to the appeal a bit). However, the game is STILL IN DEVELOPMENT, so I expect Dejobaan to add more stuff to the game as time goes on. Besides, it uses your own music, so it can have a lot of replayability if you enjoy it.","May 9, 2013","false","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

If you can spare it, buy the game and download some MP3's, sync it up, and get sucked in. It is that fantastic. I played it on my dads computer for days, and finally bought it for myself several weeks ago. Haven't played it very long on my own computer, but trust me, you will on yours.","December 5, 2013","false","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The developers claim as much - they never really found that special formula for it.\n\nYou're falling down a structure, and your goal is to weave back and forth to pass by as many parts as possible without hitting anything.

I was so excited when i heard about "Kick it" being like Audiosurf but with base jumping.\n\nIt turned out to be one of the biggest piles of steaming wank i own.\n\nThis game had a mountain of potential, i mean, you get to base jump to music in a level  that was generated to fit the music, how much better could it get? Well, for a start, it doesn't even look like a city, making the whole illusion of you base jumping become shattered from the very start which leads to it feeling rather awful.\n\nThe Humour is also a painfully annoying thing about this game. Yes, humour is a more personal thing, but when the title involves a joke, it becomes very boring, very quickly. It feels like a child who saw his parents laugh at his joke, so he won't shut up about it. They attempt to give the main character a story, but in all honesty, she feels too boring and underdeveloped to make you give a single care for her.\n\nI could make an entire list about why this game should be avoided, but i shall just cut to the most important reason:\n\nTHE DEVELOPERS ABANDONED IT.","June 2, 2015","false","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Either way the great sciency lyrics and colorful, mesmerising gameplay make this my current favorite dynamic music game.\n\nAlso, it's interesting to see how the music level generation changes each time the developer updates or adds on more levels. There are some really neat "easter egg" style levels. "Count the False Statements" is pretty great and the binaural one is very interesting.\n\nOverall I'd heartily reccomend this game to anyone who likes more abstract games or the current vein of games with levels generated from user music, or anyone in general really.
