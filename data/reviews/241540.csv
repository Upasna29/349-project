The more I played the game, the more it felt sort of rote and a little tiring. It feels like the developers built a great core gameplay loop, but didn't do much to add to that.\n\nThe way the game works is thus: You have a base stocked with survivors. As time passes, the base uses up resources. So you go around a few towns and surrounding countrysides, break into houses and warehouses and the like, and steal stuff. You'll find both items that your character can use, and resources that your base can use. You carry regular items in a backpack, which has both a slot and weight limit after which you get encumbered and tired more easily. Base resources are loaded into a large rucksack, which further encumbers you. If you can't carry everything at an area, you can send for someone from your base to run to where you are, pick up the remainder, and bring it back to the base. NPCs can get caught by zombies while they're making their way out to the looting point or while they're making their way back.\n\nYou can designate certain buildings to be "outputs". The game doesn't explain at all why you would do this, but the internet explains: the most important reason to do it is that an area designated a outpost spawns no zombies and is booby-trapped so that if external zombies move through, they get killed. You'll want to put at least a few outposts near your base to sort of create a zombie-free buffer. The second reason, which is not made clear in the game at all, is that if you leave base resources in an outpost, you will have a permanent daily allowance of that resource, which lowers your need for scavenging. By the end of the game I had a daily surplus of food and medication and broke even on fuel, so I only needed ammo and construction materials.\n\nAfter a while your character will get tired. Fatigue lowers your maximum stamina. You can keep playing, but it'll keep getting worse. So you're advised to go back to home base and switch to another character. Likewise, serious injury lowers your maximum health. This is the game's way of forcing you to use multiple characters. This can be frustrating if you only have a few with good skills. Skills include cardio, wits (ability to search through things quietly), melee combat, shooting, and reflexes (appears to relate to combat) and they are leveled up by using them; someone who shoots all the time will quickly get a high level of shooting skill. At a certain point, once you've leveled skills, you can also select "specializations" for your characters. The game does not explain this, so it was about 2/3rds of the way through the game before I discovered this was a thing.\n\nWhile you're out and about, you'll be asked to do missions. Missions could involve helping out neighboring groups of survivors, going to save one of your runners who has been caught in a zombie-infested area, helping to board up a building, climbing tall buildings to locate new sources of resources.\n\nYou can also find new areas to move to, as each base has different built-in facilities and different numbers of expansion slots. I only moved my base once, from the default church into a spacious and facility-rich warehouse. You can use materials to build different areas in your base; a guard tower, a garden, a medical tent, a research library, a cooking area, a gym/training area, etc. Some require particular survivors with particular skills to staff them, but most just give you a sort of passive boost. You can upgrade most building facilities. Ultimately other than areas that help survivors recover from fatigue or injury, I didn't really notice much of an impact from base facilities at all. It felt like another mechanic that was sort of neat but ultimately hollow.\n\nThere is a plot, but not much of one. At random, you'll get radio missions to go deal with various groups of people. There are military personnel who are here for an unknown reason, local small criminals and drug/weapons dealers, a group of friendly survivors, a courthouse serving as some kind of post-collapse civilian government, and a few one-offs. The actual plot missions themselves differ very little from the random missions you get. For example, taking the sheriff on a ride-along to clear out zombie infestations and save a trapped civilian is exactly like clearing out zombie infestations and saving trapped civilians.\n\nYour player characters are basically randoms. You start as a camping dude named Marcus who has great default skillset. He's accompanied by a perpetual whiner who is useless named Ed. You meet up with an ex-military woman named Maya. Pretty much everyone else after these three are total blind randoms. There are five or six NPC voices that voice everyone; there's a wide wide wide variety of dialogue but little in the way of characterization. They do this because anyone can permanently die. During my first run-through, I lost both Marcus and Maya due to bad planning about 10 minutes apart 4 hours in. I was so gutted that I restarted the game. In my second and final playthrough, I was about 7 hours in when I lost Marcus on a routine errand. I considered restarting again. So they've done a good job of making the loss of a high level character pretty tragic. Marcus was my only loss that wasn't ordained by plot reasons on my second playthrough.\n\nI guess I would describe my experience as sort of hollow. I loved the melee combat, which is quite complex and very tense (although poorly explained). I loved driving around in my car and opening my door to whack a passing zombie, or doing a donut and whipping a zombie hanging off the back into a telephone pole. But... I guess I never really felt like anything matters. I'd just wander around and scavenge (unnecessarily, my resources were never low) until I'd get a mission, missions were basically no different than wandering around in general, I'd play side missions until I got a plot mission, which were no different really. Occasionally I'd have to go back to my base to check on construction or switch characters. I was never scarce on weapons or ammo or meds at my base. I always had more than enough influence, the game's currency.\n\nSo in conclusion, I'd say that this is definitely a game that's worth trying, but that if you're like me, you might get tired of part-way through because there's not a lot of variation and much of the game seems a little like busy-work.","May 26, 2014","true","15.5"," 2,359 of 2,449 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","359","2","0","40"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BelgiumGrey/recommended/241540/","BelgiumGrey","Grey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BelgiumGrey/","48 products in account","Seeing i poured more hours into this game than the average review-writing player, i figured i should write my own review as well. There might be spoilers.\nSo here goes:\n\nI'm not a fan of most zombie games, which seem to revolve around "shoot millions of zombies to win". There is no "winning" State of decay. The zombies are everywhere and the horde is endless. The base game ends when your survivors manage to leave Trumbull Valley and you are left wondering "How long will they last without my help?"\nAnd this is exactly what i love about State of Decay.\n\nThe game & DLC's in a nutshell:\n\nState of Decay:\nYou and your buddy went on your annual fishing trip, while you were gone large swaths of the US have been overrun by zombies. You get attacked as soon as you tie off your boat. Fighting them off is easy enough but now need to figure out what happened and where you can find a safe place to stay. Jump in the nearest car and meet up with fellow survivors holed up at a church. Then the game begins for real and answers are gradually given.\n\nBreakdown:\nSame map, alternate storyline. Several weeks after the outbreak, you and Lily are the last 2 survivors of an enclave and you know you wont last much longer on your own. While you look for another enclave to join, Lily packs up and will meet you there with whatever supplies are left. Once settled it's back to basics: survive for as long as you can. You quickly realize resources are dwindling while zombie numbers increase. Eventually it's time to move on: you pack all equipment in the RV, load up your most important survivors and look for a new home. Your new home is on the exact same map, but with fresh resources and.. more zombies.\n\nLifeline:\nNew map. You are in command of the last military outpost in the overrun city of Danforth. You must secure your base, shore up your defenses and start the search for various survivors. The brass will direct you to high-value assets: scientists, doctors and their families whose expertise might be crucial to find an eventual cure. Along the way stranded survivors cry out for help and you're the only one with the means to respond. Your actions will decide the fate of not only Danforth, but possibly the whole world.\n\n\nI'll do a short pros and cons but there are a few things i should really point out first. State of Decay is not about killing lots of zombies. It is about people trying to survive the zombie apocalypse. There are endless zombies but finite resources. Sure, it is great fun to smash your truck into a few zombie hordes or grab a machine gun and go on a killing spree, but that's not the intention of the game. When you're done a good truck will be broken, perhaps beyond repair. Or a lot of bullets will have been wasted on ever respawning zombies. So when you clear an area of zombies, you damn better scavenge as much as you can.\n\nWhen you scavenge you may find resources you can use to improve your base or tools for zombie killing. Food and various painkillers/stimulants are also often found. There are a few possible home sites (bases) in the game for you to eventually choose from. Each of them has certain requisites and advantages/disadvantages, but larger is better :). Always you have to make tough choices: will i go for a workshop to repair weapons & cars, or rather a field hospital to aid the people who will inevitably fall sick? No one wants to go down with Black Fever.. trust me. Maybe i can have both IF i sacrifice room for the workout area, but then all survivors will have less stamina and fighting skills.. Choices.\nOver the course of the game missions will pop up: help scavenging, clear out an infestation, save a survivor, trade resources with your neighbours, kill a freak zombie.\n\nUnfortunately most of these missions can be boiled down to a simple fact: your fellow survivors have the mental capacity and survival skill of a baked potato. You are the only one who's good at it, and it's up to you to do ALL the work. I found this annoying when i first played the game and put it aside for a few weeks for that reason only. However, if you accept that's just how it is, embrace it, and you'll still have a most enjoyable game.\nA few other points of light irritation:\n- Graphics: good enough for a game of this price, but definately not top notch.\n- Controls: especially car controls feel sluggish.\n- Clipping: zombies occasionally clip trough solid objects. Not a problem if it's just a regular zombie, a bit more annoying when it's a Big Un or Feral in an enclosed space.\n- Useless survivors: Plenty of them and no "clean" way to get rid of them.\n\nThe pros:\nOpen world game: You go where you want, when you want.\nPermadeath: Your survivor got ambushed and killed? He's dead, no reloading an earlier save.\nStamina & carry capacity: The game's way of saying you're just an average Joe, not Rambo.\nTraits and Skills: The game's way of taking the "average" out of "average Joe"\nSoundtrack: Composed by Jesper Kyd. 'Nuff said.\nMods: Don't like this or that? Maybe want to see more of that other stuff? Check out the modding community, or find out how to do it yourself. Besides tweaking Breakdown to make it more enjoyable, i also added myself as a playable character. Much fun was had.\n\nAll in all i found this a very enjoyable game and the DLC's are definately worth it. Has been on sale several times @ -66% orso.\nEven grabbed back to it a few months after i finished it.","November 2, 2014","true","360.8"," 777 of 835 people (93%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","93","777","835","18","9"

It really reminded me at times of playing a GTA game with zombies in it.\n\n\nKnow this before buying!!!\n\nThe worst part about this game hands down is the fact the game plays on its own when you are not there....What? Things progress/change when you are not playing! This should have been a Hardcore feature or something similar, seems like the devs were taking the "simulation" aspect a little too far. If you only have time to play an hour here and there, you might not want to play this.\n\nThe other annoying part about this game, which I think ties back into the simulation aspect, is the save system. While some may like the system implemented for this game, I find it unbelievably stupid. It's basically only checkpoints, no save points you can create, ever. My ideal save system would be like Fallout 3's, essentially any time and anywhere.\n\nThese issues might not bother you or might make you want to play the game more, but for me, these issues make playing the game less enjoyable. I still recommend it as there is some good fun, but just be warned about those features. I would have surely waited for a cheaper sale had I known about those features first.","December 25, 2013","true","10.9"," 611 of 658 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","611","658","0","18"

Open world zombie game done pretty good! Combat for me, is fluid and very fun. You can easily trample 5-10 zombies with this system and never get angry at someone doing what they're not supposed to be doing it. The NPCS during combat are amazing, they do so much damage a full crew of 4 could likely take out 200 zombies. A smart move here, is that in this game killing zombies is mostly useless! They did not add any sort of item cultivation or gold drops from zombies which is great.\n\nThe environments are pretty good as well. You always feeling like youre in a random farm or in a little suburb, largely because the zombie variety is so good as well!\n\nThe ability to macro manage your "crews' resources and deal with shortages and other random misfortunes is a great add.","November 26, 2013","true","89.7"," 1,734 of 1,970 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","734","1","0","30"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eggtooth/recommended/241540/","eggtooth","Eggtooth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eggtooth/","687 products in account",""There are a lot of zombie games, but this one looks old, but feels fresh"\n\nGame overall is very good and deep, and has nicely executed gameplay mechanics that make you occupied for long time, just because you come back to it for more. You need to gather supplies in order to survive, but also you need to keep people in top shape by wiping out infestations, killing hordes, gathering supplies and eventually take them outside of base and kill some zombies together with them to make them feel more clever. Base too small? Find another one, and order everybody to move to it. You've been long time outside of base exploring the area? Your character will get tired and eventually run out of stamina (or the stamina bar will be impossible to fill fully). When you'll get hurt too many times, your health lowers and you need to switch to other characters. Lost your character? It's gone. You cannot have it back. This is the main thing I love in this game. When you loose one of characters, it hurts, this character is gone. This is when I realised that dialogs and overall - story - of characters is very good and nicely written. At some point I felt so emotionally connected with Markus (main character you start as first time) that when I died while playing as him, I've started game again from the beggining, because I didn't want to loose him. Did I mention that game is open world? Yes it is, you can do whatever you want untill whole map will eventually run out of resources. That is another unique thing about this game. Nothing respawns. Crashed your car and it exploded? You loose it. Gathered supplies from nearby house? They're gone. They never respawn. This adds so much realism to the game, and fear that you need to take risks in order to survive. You can also get some new freeloaders to your base. Of course it will be possible to switch to them, after you fullfill tasks they give you (going to their base and dropping supplies), or just after bringing them to your base. Generally speaking, there is a lot to do, and this review will not cover all of this stuff, you just need to find out more by yourself.\n\nTechnically speaking, this game is pretty outdated. Graphics are somewhat old looking, but they're not ugly. Just textures could use better resolution, and animations could use some more fixing. Well, we cannot expect much as Undead Labs ported this game from Xbox 360, where it was successfull as it is now on PC. It runs on CryEngine 3. First I thought it was Unity 3D, but after some readings I've discovered it uses Crytek's engine. I thought that it pretty much wasted it's potential. As mentioned above animations are sometimes jerky, and doesn't fit the situation. Some textures are ugly, low res, but overall, it's not ugly to the point to make you puke. Performance is pretty poor on Ultra Spec. It does run noticably better at High Spec (Graphic options are named like this) with 60FPS, but does have some drops to 40 in towns. My PC is not top notch, I have i3-3.2 GHz, 4GB RAM, Radeon HD7850 2GB, but still it could use some more 'love' to make it run smoothly. Game has very limited graphic options (one slider) but it does job well improving the performance.\n\nControls. Game lacks some stuff that could come in handy for some group of players. I dislike forced Mouse Acceleration. Thank god Undead Labs added rebindable keyboard bindings, so it's easier to configure and play.\n\nGame does not have multiplayer and will never have. Developers stated a lot of times that this game won't have any possible coop or multiplayer. It's all reserved for upcoming Class4 (this game is Class3) and honestly? In single player it plays so well that I didn't even noticed lack of multiplayer.\n\nOverall, game is worth the money, so is upcoming 'Breakdown' DLC which will only add some more of gameplay. Game has enough content to make you occupied for looooong time. It's best zombie game to date, it looks old, but feels fresh despite it's obvious flaws. Undead Labs - Congratulations.\n\n8.5/10","November 25, 2013","true","26.8"," 961 of 1,095 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","961","1","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alexspeed/recommended/241540/","alexspeed","Alexspeed","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alexspeed/","6182 products in account","State of Decay is a game that fills a niche that many games tried to fill but none did yet.\nBut it does it in its own unique way, and it does it very well.\n\nYou are managing a group of survivors in a zombie-apocalypse. Its something you need to get used to, there are alot of random characters and some plot centric ones that you can get attached to, and mourn for when you loose them to the zeds. There is permadeath, and its cruel. The game can bring out emotions in alot of ways, which is a strong point for it.\n\nThere is also base-building in the game on several predetermined locations. The game is a Sandbox, things happen if you are playing or not. As long as you keep morale high and your base secure, you shouldnt have too many suprises whenever you get back to it after you took a break.\n\nThe story is told over different mission arcs that you have to follow, to eventually get out of the valley the game takes part in. Overall the story is well presented but it could have been longer and the end is unsatisfying in my opinion. The non-story missions are quite repetitive and can get to be a bit of a chore over time.\n\nGeneraly the game felt too easy once you know how to deal with the zeds and have your survivors trained. Yes, you can level your survivors skills and there is nice progression in the skill system. And even tough you might feel like a zombie-slaying superhero at times, as soon as you pay not attention for a moment you can be in dire troubles. If you get reckless you will loose characters to hordes, and to special infected (which are very similar to those in Left4Dead).\n\nThe graphics are pretty dissapointing resolutionwise, and the user interface is clumsy and ugly at best. That is because the game was ported from consoles for PC, but generally ist not a bad port. The Devs really tried their best to make the game work for PC. The controls with Keyboard & Mouse where fine (Controllers work too of course). The graphical variety still can overcome the bad texures, so that those only stay a minor annoyance.\n\nI didnt run into any plot-stopping bugs or crashes (seems those where fixed), the game gets still patched from the devs and there will be a second DLC coming out at one point. The first DLC adds an endless mode to the game which is a nice addition.\n\nIts a bit weird to sum up this game with its many small flaws and at the end still say its a great game, but it really is, even tough it could surely have been better in many aspects. Its the whole experience and atmosphere that makes it worth playing. Its a unique game in many ways, and a very welcome and creative suprise in the many zombie/survival games that all feel pretty similar overall.\n\nEveryone should play this, wholly reccommended.\n\nAnd dont lose Maya, like i did.","April 10, 2014","true","59.8"," 462 of 517 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","462","517","0","17"

I’ve heard/read people saying it’s a good game but didn’t realise it was SO addicting too.\n\nLet’s start by explaining what the whole game is about, without spoilers of course. It’s zombie apocalypse time and you are one of the survivors. You aid other survivors, build a community, search for supplies like food, gas, ammunition and weapons to survive.\n\nYou have the freedom to move around the open world how you like, set up a base (home) in various locations, choose what kind of services your base has (medical room, library to study, mechanics to fix cars & gear etc.)\n\nYou can build watch tower in your base, order men to practice shooting, extend the safe zone around your map by sniping everyone around your base, train other neighbouring survivors in your camp in exchange of goods.\n\nYou can take over empty buildings like gas stations, cafeterias etc. and build outposts there. Outpost have a ‘safe zone’ around them, where zombies will not spawn so it’s a good place to have a breather. Outpost also grant you access to your base supplies, so you can quickly switch weapons and other gear there.\n\nYour base has a radio that helps you keeping in contact with other survivors and NPCs in the world. This is also how you will get most of your quests, distress calls etc. You can contact your base via radio and ask them to track specific supplies for you - or you can just scavenge around and search houses and buildings for everything usefull.\n\nYou can load stuff you find in your backbag and in trunk of a car. When you can’t carry more, you can ask base to send runners who will make their way to your location and loot the place. You can wait for the runner and aid him in returning the goods back home, or go your merry way and let them do it without you. They are usually quite handy with their weapons, though it all depends on what gear you are giving to your community.\n\nSometimes they chew more than they can handle and might end up surrounded by zombies, trapped in house etc. If you like your buddies, you go and help ‘em - or let them struggle alone. If you don’t offer any help, that has an impact in your own reputation within the group. So basically, don’t ♥♥♥♥ around and help your own men. Also helping neighbours and other communities has it’s benefits.\n\nThe more people you have living in your base, the more rations they take up per day. The more people you have, the more security you have. The more people you have, the more inner problems you have. People will occasionally get mad at each other, have sleeping problems, fear the outside world. Quite often you can solve these issues - but there’s bound to happen something nasty eventually.\n\nYou start the game by controlling one person. After a while you gain more friends and allies and you can then control them too. Once a person is too badly wounded or too tired, you can then switch to another person and keep doing the tasks required to survive, while others rest and keep up the base. (Guard the perimeter, cook food, hunt for supplies, fix broken equipment, manufacture traps, silencers, bullets etc.)\n\nThe world inside State of Decay goes on, even when you are offline. The event gradually slow down, the more time you are away from game and in three (3) days the time will be almost at stand still. So, if you have a real life too and log in the game next day, be prepared. Something might have happened to your community while you were away.\n\nIf you are into zombie/post apocalyptic game this game is a must buy. I highly recommend it. Oh and remember, if you ♥♥♥♥ up and someone dies, he/she is dead for good. I was saddened to see my favorite guy die just because I was too cheap with healing kits.","June 25, 2014","true","36.6"," 267 of 295 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","267","295","0","8"

Great game play, awesome open world experience with zombies. The zombies are a threat in large number but easy to deal with in small numbers. Looting is enjoyable and rewarding at times other frustrating when zombies keep coming from the noise your making. Level up characters can make you think about who you take out on supply runs and how careful you plot your moves when dealing with large groups of zombies or special zombies. Shooting is good but you have to keep in mind that the zombies will start coming to you the longer you stay in one place shooting rounds off.

Not to mention for all those people who love their eye candy.. fairly good graphics\n\nThe main thing that gets me with this game however is that the survivors you work with overall are just... useless. Your base's radio operator is constantly spamming you with messages about how "so and so has wandered into a horde of zombies like a dumbass and you need to save them!", you go and save his/her ♥♥♥ and then another message comes in about another idiot who's achieved the same thing (sometimes even the same guy! xD) Ultimately you dont really connect with any of the characters in that most of the lines and voices (there is very little variety in this regard) are just copy and pastes from one person to another, all in all i would estimate about 5 voices for each gender.\n\nOne thing i always like in my games especially open-world ones are the mods! there are quite a lot of different mods for this game involving things like little tweaks to zombies, combat, vehicles ect and big stuff like base overhauls and porting weapons and vehicles from the DLC into the main game. Probably put an extra 20 hours into the game thanks to this.\n\nThe game is certainly worth buying for a zombie fan if you've got cash to spare or it's on sale but dont expect to be playing it for months to come, its a very short but sweet playthrough for most people i have spoken to despite the flaws\n\nI would rate this game a 7/10 and i hope that people find this review i made useful","October 3, 2014","true","124.5"," 172 of 188 people (91%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","91","172","188","13","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/senppuu/recommended/241540/","senppuu","Senppuu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/senppuu/","1220 products in account","After about 17 hours I finished the campaign, and I enjoyed this game very much!\n\nLet me give you all some pros and cons from my perspective:\n\nYour mission is to survive and make your stand with others like you, gather supplies and look for shelter is the first thing that comes to mind, and also try to kill everything in a specific area to try and create a "safe zone", which is actually impossible since the zombies will eventually spawn there again. I saw a horde spawn right next to me right after I got out of the car once, I disliked this aspect of the game to say the truth, it killed the "sneaking" feeling of hunting down and intercepting enemies before they reach the area you just cleared.\n\nA car is your best friend in this game, they are just ridiculously over powered. Once you unlock the vehicle delivery radio assistance you are pretty much invincible, that makes the game really fun because you can go out playing bowling simulator with zombies in the streets... But it's a huge con in my opinion, the game gets too easy. A fuel system would be a good idea to implement, and also a specialization system to turn the cars on, it feels really weird that every car in the city is open, with infinite gas and the keys just sitting there in the ignition...\n\nWhen you die you die for real, and since there's not a manual save option in the game make sure to press f4 when you see you're not going to make it... When you die you switch to another survivor from your group which is friendly to you, or if you don't have any friends you just get a random guy. I died once and decided to restart the game, learned my lesson the hard way.\n\nOnce you progress enough in the game you can relocate your base, the best option is the Snyder Trucking Warehouse. You need at least 12 people in your group to move there, and once it's up and running you are going to feel untouchable, since you can have up to 8 outposts, and the consequence of that is a very big safe zone for you to chill during the zombie apocalypse.\n\nRegarding the other survivor groups that appears during the game, the only thing that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off is the fact that you lose trust with them, if for example you approach them with a car, you get a penalty for "reckless driving" and they also can catch on fire if you throw a molotov near them, don't even think about using guns, unless you are alone, they will get in your way and get hit. But if you swing a machete or a sledgehammer in their head nothing will happen... It would also be really cool if other survivor groups could attack you, trying to steal your supplies or even your base.\n\nYou lose stamina and even health as time goes on, the only option to get better is to switch characters and let the other one rest. But most people really don't want to go out playing with another survivor, there should be an option to rest and wake up rested the next day.\n\nIt's also much more difficult to play in the night, you do have a flashlight, but other than that everything else is completely dark, all you can see are the red eyes of the zombies, and that's awesome! I remember one time when I went on a mission to retrieve a watch for one of the survivors, I had to go to the starting area of the game, and I went there after the sunset and managed to explode my car trying to jump a broken bridge, which attracted a lot of zombies, and there wasn't any other vehicle nearby. All I had with me was an axe and some firecrackers, I had to sneak all my way through the woods, and use the firecrackers to get the attention of the nearby hordes so I could get the damn watch and gtfo of there, I felt like I was in the game at that moment, and that's when I thought, this game is awesome!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shadeball/recommended/241540/","Shadeball","Shadeball","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shadeball/","130 products in account","NOTE: This review is months old so the game might be different (and $10 cheaper) now. To those who think you're being original asking how I can 'not recommend' it with 200 hours logged... it's been remarked upon, check the other comments. I'm not saying it's terrible, just that I didn't really recommend it- read the whole review, not just the red thumb, you might decide the positives outweigh the negatives for you. Also, I didn't actively play for 200 hours.\n\n\n\nState of Decay's a good game, and a mediocre 'simulation.' Unfortunately it insists on trying to be a simulator too much and the result is a flawed game that demands respect but does little to respect the player's time.\n\nSOD has an impressive open world with most buildings having multiple entry ports. These buildings are part of the world and require no loading as do some games. This is necessary because at any time you might need to escape into or out of a building as zombies attack. There are also multiple sites for 'home bases' which is nice but are not without problems: restrictions on facilities that don't make sense, barbed wire fences that block players but not zombies, etc.\n\nThe zombies themself are well-done, and most can be outrun or fought without much difficulty... until the complications start. Like running from one pack of them right into another, or having one come around the corner just as you've used up your last bit of strength. There are also special zombies, some of which tend to be pretty annoying because of their quick lethality and insane hitpoints. I find the zombie hordes to be much more enjoyable, as they lead to more tense moments and thrilling fights\escapes\deaths.\n\nThere are quite a few characters in the game that can be found or not found randomly in most cases. Sometimes you'll only know one was there when you find a corpse. Others can be recruited and, if you earn enough "trust" from them, become playable. This brings up a strange mechanic of the game: who are they trusting? The game does not have a 'main' player character (though you always start as the same guy) and affords no opportunity to create one. Instead the player switches between different survivors encountered. While many of the possible characters have interestings traits and appearances, it would be nice to be able to create one, and this would make more sense mechanically than having a pool of survivors share nebulous resources like 'trust' and 'influence'. It would seem such an idea runs afoul of the designers' narrow philosophical approach to the game; more on that later.\n\nUnfortunately many of the random characters end up feeling generic, even to the point of sharing the same voices. Because you can't see someone's traits before recruiting them, it's a crapshoot if you get a useless drunk or a warrior doctor. Since it's not easy to kick people out, one strategy\exploit is to constantly recruit survivors and then purposely kill the weak ones by guiding them into a group of zombies. That such a tactic need exist points to a need for improvement in the game.\n\nThe quest missions are good, though there are not many of them; most of the time will be taken up by a series of "SOS" style requests for assistance that get annoying because of their frequency. It would seem that the survivors whom the player is not controlling exist solely to get in trouble and make the player divert from whatever task he or she was doing and rescue them. It gets very tiring to hear the radio operator keep calling out "Aren't you going to help our friends" again and again as you're trying to find the supplies to keep the base going. Also annoying is the fact that there are some quest missions you can let linger for as long as you'd like, and others that resolve (i.e. fail) on their own, but the game doesn't differentiate between the two types for you. This feeds into the idea that the devs wanted to force the player to choose between competing tasks, but ends up just overloading the game and stopping the players from doing what they want... unless you're okay with one of your survivors dying because you were across the map.\n\nGuns and other weapons are plentiful and varied, the latter perhaps unnecessarily (how many blunt objects do I really need?). Ammunition is so scarce that it makes some guns nearly useless but there are ways when you want to just open up with an M60. And yes, doing so will draw plenty of zombies, so a silenced .22 pistol is much more effective. Weapons are fun to use in general. Survivors can 'level up' with different weapons, making them seem like an investment, a nice feature that could have been used even more: how about experienced survivors stop needing their hands held?\n\nThere is no save option (but on exit) and the game enforces permadeath. Moreoever there is a rudimentary 'simulation' (more of a calculation upon restarting the game) that bases itself on how long you've gone without playing and the state of decay (see what I did there?) at the time of quitting. It might just take away a bunch of your influence and resources, or it might cause all sorts of other problems if you had to quit while things weren't hunky-dorey (i.e. without clearing infestations, raising morale, etc). This is the biggest problem I have with the game, as it sits there on my steam shelf threatening me, saying "if you don't play me now, you might as well never come back." So I tend not to go back. Changing one's system clock can circumvent the process, but that seems like a ridiculous workaround. While the game slows down time progression after a couple days, it's a very poor choice to have such a mandatory 'feature' for people who may only have a couple hours every few days to play. You'll log in hoping to progress your game, but instead be forced to try and make up lost ground. It hurts what could be a great game to pick up and put down occasionally.\n\nThe developers want the game played a certain way and stress that they are trying to simulate a zombie apocolypse, rather than make another game like "Dead Rising." Unfortunately, SOD doesn't do better as a simulation. The player is always having seemingly every task delegated to him or her, but is expected to play as just another NPC. It's clear that if the player weren't around, things would collapse (at least given what happens when the player logs off to attend to real life for a few days), yet you lose 'influence' (i.e. money) by putting a weapon in storage (the store) and taking it back out again. Again, there is an exploit to avoid this, but there shouldn't need to be one. I could get behind the theme of a zombie game that focuses less on individuality, but I'd want it to be done better; maybe an isometric like Jagged Alliance... except with zombies. It would be nice to see other survivors going about their tasks instead of only hearing from them when they need help, for example.\n\nHad the developers made the permadeath, save system and 'simulation' into a recommended or 'hardcore' feature, the game would be quite better off, as would players who could make that choice. The open world, while a little small, is quite good and does feel somewhat populated (particularly before various locales get overrun via the storyline). Walking or driving around feels 'right,' even when it is a little annoying to have to drive across the map.\n\nI'd recommend this game to someone who really wants to get addicted; it can make you want to do just one more thing before bed, taking up lots of time. It also does 'open world' quite well. But if you don't have that time available, I would be wary. I came down on the side of "not recommending" in general largely because the developers are so strident about their 'vision' that they not only don't include some basic gaming conventions (i.e. save slots), but actively disassociate from them. Just because something is popular doesn't always make it bad, and making something harder doesn't necessarily make it good.","November 26, 2013","false","217.5"," 2,347 of 3,191 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","347","3","0","125"

You're going to spend a ridiculous amount of time having stories to share with your friends unfold before your eyes.\n\nThe base game has an enjoyable story, though it's the sandboxy feel that goes along with it that makes this game an excellent one.  You are continually capable of working toward your next story goal at your own pace, though if you're like me you'll find the majority of the game is spent exploring, collecting supplies, building up your base, dealing with other survivor groups, gaining skills for you survivors, etc.  Every character has a unique backstory and there are -a lot- of survivors out there that you might run into and have join you.\n\nThe base building is simple, yet very enjoyable as well.  Depending on what skills your survivors have, different options are available and you have plenty of options available to you.  Do you want to be able to support more survivors?  Build a bunkhouse and a garden so that they have a comfortable place to sleep and food to eat if your scavenged supplies run low.  Looking to cut back on the sneaking around and really take the fight to the zombies?  An infirmary will keep your survivors healthy and a munitions shop will keep them well armed.  Just remember, even healthy, well armed survivors might run into a challenge when facing off against the 'freaks' or special zombies.\n\nThe Breakdown DLC removes the deep story aspect of the the vanilla campaign, though it adds a brand new achievement system that unlocks 'hero' survivors that, more often than not, are more capable than your average survivor.  This mode also has 'Breakdown Levels', each time you complete one you move on to the next, more challenging phase, with new survivor achievements to unlock.\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the zombie survival genre.  I'd been looking for a game like this for a very long time and was extremely happy when I installed it and truly learned what it was all about.  Enjoy and I'd love to hear your stories!","October 11, 2014","true","89.4"," 73 of 81 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","73","81","0","0"

The game was a mediocre console port, with glaring issues for the pc (performance, gfx, controls, interface/gui, etc.) While most issues weren't completely gamebreaking, they added up to enough to make me quit the game until propper support was released.\n\nTwo DLC's (one of which was originally announced to be free) and one year later, glaring bugs and issues are still abound, with no support. Now, they have announced the Year One Survival Edition - which includes the original SoD + DLCs + added content + gfx update + some bug/control fixes. Sounds great! Except they want to charge another $30, AND drop all support for the original SoD.\n\nedit: Since this game is no longer supported, just get YOSE edition when it goes on sale for ~$5-10.\n\n6\10","April 15, 2015","false","28.4"," 118 of 148 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","118","148","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jonesyjonesin/recommended/241540/","jonesyjonesin","Jonesy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jonesyjonesin/","290 products in account","State of Decay is a third-person open-world zombie apocalypse game where you build and fortify a base of operations, recruit survivors, and scavenge for useful items and vehicles. It's a highly addictive, frequently tense, and often action-packed game that exceeded all my expectations, and I strongly recommend it.\n\nWhile you initially start by playing one survivor, as more people are saved and given shelter in your community you'll be able to switch back and forth between a dozen or more playable characters. This becomes a necessity, as survivors will get injured (or even permanently killed) or just flat-out exhausted when performing missions, and will need time to recuperate. Characters have a handful of skills such as melee combat, fitness, or shooting that will level up with use, and some survivors you recruit will even turn out to have special talents, such as an expert gardener who can increase the amount of food supplied by the greenhouse you built at your base, or a munitions expert who can use your workshop to create useful items such as pipe bombs or mines. Your community as a whole has a morale level that you need to keep reasonably high by completing missions and scavenging supplies, or risk adverse results such as a survivor abandoning the group, or even deciding to off themselves. Influence is also measured and plays a huge factor. Provide for and assist the community and you'll be able to equip yourself with better gear from the group's communal supply, convince another survivor to tag along and watch your back, or direct the group's radio operator to keep an ear out for the location of especially needed supplies. Slack by letting missions expire or by failing to scavenge enough useful items, and you'll end up poorly equipped and with minimal clout until you can turn things around.\n\nWhile there's a variety of activities and missions to take part in - rescuing newly discovered survivors and getting them back to base safely; hunting down relatively rare boss zombies (or "weird ones" as the characters sometimes refer to them); working your way through several threads of primary story missions; or simply trying to return home in one piece with that valuable case of medicine or that fragile high-end sports car you happened across - there's no doubt that Decay is primarily about fighting zombies. And seeing as how they're virtually everywhere, you can't outrun them beyond short distances (zombies don't get winded, but you definitely will, often at the most inopportune times), stealth is only practical on occasion, and vehicles are too fragile to be used as your main zombie-killing method, you'll be engaging zombies quite frequently whenever you're away from your base. There's a reasonable variety of nicely-done fighting animations. Special combat moves can be unlocked as your skills improve, and that weakling survivor who started out by barely being able to swing a pipe and had trouble defeating even a single zombie without getting gnawed on rather extensively can become a real powerhouse in time, rendering an encounter with a few zombies as nothing more than an annoyance, and even becoming capable of wading into the middle of an entire horde of half a dozen zombies or more and coming out alive (although almost certainly not unscathed). While guns are a relatively common find, making noise in Decay generally leads to bad things happening, so you'll likely be doing most of your killing hand to hand. The noise from bashing in a door or a zombie's skull, the engine of a vehicle, or even just searching through an abandoned house can be enough to alert a nearby zombie or two; firing off a few shots from a pistol, shotgun, or rifle, even one with a suppressor attached, seems to bring every zombie for blocks around running, and is best done only as a last resort, or when you're a few steps away from a nearby vehicle or the safety of your base, or in the handful of story missions where you actually have some significant backup. Fortunately, even though you may do it hundreds of times by game's end, sprinting up to a zombie so you can dropkick it to the ground and then finishing it off by driving your knee through its face never really gets old.\n\nIt's a thoroughly addictive game, building and improving your base and leveling up your various survivors. It's also often a surprisingly tense one. The game has a day/night cycle, so half the time you're in the dark, and getting a request to clear out a nearby infested warehouse or hunt down a dangerous boss zombie when you can barely see ten feet in front of you is unlikely to be something you'll look forward to. Even during the day, some of the structures you'll enter will be shrouded in darkness, with a zombie unseen (but fortunately usually not unheard) ready to pounce from some dark corner. And of course there's the ever-present threat of permadeath. No matter how badass your survivor is, there's always the possibility that a fight will spiral out of control, that beating one zombie to re-death makes enough noise to alert another, and fighting that one draws in two more, and suddenly routine combat has turned dire and potentially deadly. That one time you keep your injured, exhausted, broken-weaponed, out-of-healing-items survivor out extra long because you're low on influence and you've decided to search one more house for supplies may also be the one time they manage to accidentally alert a nearby horde. Which quite possibly will lead to you becoming an unwilling witness to the rather brutal death animation.\n\nDecay is not without some issues. There are minor annoyances, such as the lack of variety in the vehicles, or the fact that despite gasoline being a salvageable resource nobody thought to bring a generator along and you're forced to stumble around your base bumping into walls in the dark with an under-powered flashlight. But there are a few more serious issues as well. At least one side mission failed to trigger. One of my survivors clipped into a piece of furniture and became stuck, forcing me to exit mid-mission and lose progress, while on another occasion a favorite survivor became inexplicably glued to a structure's outside wall, making her a nice easy target for a charging boss zombie and getting her killed (on the final story mission, no less). And the game essentially continues to play after you exit, with the continued, unseen scavenging and activities of the community members simulated the next time the game is launched, and while that lends it an interesting twist, it has a tendency to cause overtly negative events, such as illogical, precipitous morale drops, and some players even reporting returning after an absence to find significant items or survivors themselves having disappeared without even a journal entry of explanation.\n\nUltimately though, those issues have little bearing on the overall experience, and the positives far outweigh any negatives. In short, not only is State of Decay the most enjoyable game I've played in recent memory, it's quite probably my favorite game of 2013.","December 7, 2013","true","80.8"," 105 of 130 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","105","130","0","12"

Population size is dwindling along with the resources you can find throughout the city you explore. Time is not on your side, the world will persist even when you are not playing. Finding a fortifiable location to barricade from zombie hordes is critical to winning the game.\n\nProgression\nAs you progress through the story you are given certain facilities to use as your headquarters, once you hit a certain point of the game you are allowed to re-allocate your base.\n\nSurvival\nThe main game focuses on a balance between survival, difficulty and story. Any character you play can be killed off by zombies and stay dead. There is no way to bring them back other than starting over again or attempting to exit the game before it auto-saves. Some characters clearly have better traits than others especially the first guy you play as. If you let them die, you will be disadvantaged. Training multiple characters to be strong and capable of survival is critical.\n\nBreakout DLC\nThe DLC is survival oriented with the story stripped out, which results in a good experience, not interrupted by constantly redoing cinematics or certain missions over and over. Instead, it allows you to play at your own pace and repair the van to proceed to the next difficulty. Every trip reduces the total amount of resources within the city, scales the damage of the enemies up, and reduces the amount of cars available.\n\nPersistent World\nA major con to some people but also appealing to others is the persistent world. Alot of people dislike the fact that while you're away from the game the resources are depleting every day. The people who play more hours a day have a much greater benefit than those who play few hours or attempt to play it casually.","January 8, 2014","true","107.8"," 59 of 72 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","59","72","0","0"

Have you watch/read/play the Walking Dead series? No? than you should...if yes, feel it's different than other zombie genre? cause that's how State of Decay will make you feel.\n\nHave you try DayZ? or Rust, or Borderlands or other apocalyptic games. which most of it focus on 'multiplayer' or 'coop'. If that what you digg, than good for you. What if you didn't? what if you want to play a single player experience and proceed at your own pace. Without having to deal with 'a**hat' in online game, that will ruins your game by killing you at the glimpse of your body. Than, this is your game. A single player experience of zombie game that you never play before.\n\nThis game is not about all out killing zombies. It's more of a base management simulation. When it make you feel/think how to survive day and night, while managing a group of survivors. Like how Rick have to, in Walking Dead. Gathering resources is not because you want to, but only just because you need. Take only what you have to, and leave the rest for later. Resources are scatter.. and limited for the whole map. No respawn of resources. You may see the map kinda small, but after you travel, it is really big. Lot of places to scavange. Lot of story to unfold. Roleplay a bit on your journey. It will make the game better. Take the limitation in game as a challenges, on what you can do in order to overcome those obstacles, such as storage limits etc.  Feel the need to survive, in this State of Decay.","June 16, 2014","true","23.3"," 58 of 78 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","58","78","0","4"

I also took note of the animations in the game, they seemed really awkward. The textures also seemed to look dull, I was expecting them to look a bit sharper considering this was running on CRYengine but never mind that. A remastered version was coming out to the new consoles, which means an update for us!!!! .... kind of.\n\nWe too on PC got the Year One version however what it is, is simply an update to this version of SoD.

It's repetitive, grindy, and feels incomplete/unfinished especially with its joke of an ending. Base building is super shallow and relationships between survivors are nonexistent. AI is atrocious for survivors and zombies. If you're in a siege mission, then all your AI companions do is stand still and board up windows while the only thing that zombies do is attack the boarded windows. Big ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s don't enter the house, they just ram into it which damages the boards. You literally have to exit the house and kill the zombies outside to progress things.\n\nYour survivors constantly go missing/get stuck/need to be rescued, hordes constantly spawn, infestations constantly spawn, special zombies constantly spawn, etc. The game simulates itself when you're not playing it so if you don't want to come back to a game where all your neighbors are dead, all your supplies are drained, and your group is missing, then enjoy babysitting constantly to quit the game on a good note. You can also just keep the game indefinitely paused to prevent this.\n\nThere are few home sites, and only 2 of them are any good.\n\nScavenging is pointless if you play for long periods of time. Despite having a day/night cycle, days only pass during simulation. Supplies only drain when you're not playing the game and you can easily overstock on everything in about 30-45 minutes.\n\nThe game is also incredibly easy. After clocking in about 30 hours, I only died once and that's because I was trying to make my experience as hard as possible.\n\nMechanics are easily abusable. Stuck alone with no health and a feral chasing you? Switch to a character in your home base and then switch back to your character. He/she will teleport immediately back to base.\n\nGame is very short too. You can easily beat it in 8-10 hours.\n\nI guess the best thing I can say is the port is very faithful to the 360 original. They even ported over all the bugs and glitches!\n\nAlmost nothing has changed in this game from when it was an Early Access title to a full fledged release. There are no graphical customization options, limited resolution options, awful performance, and mouse acceleration.\n\nThe DLC looks like it might be fun but I'll stay away from it until it's sub-$5.\n\nMy full review:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfjPIUHWHnA","December 1, 2013","false","82.1"," 133 of 207 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","133","207","0","6"

The game starts well with you straight in the thick of it, which almost made up for the bad cut scenes where my character's feet are glued to the floor. Nothing is explained: the whole inventory, skills, crafting menus are left for you to faff about with until you get the hang of them. The only skill you really need however is inventory management in order to shuffle around all the semi-useless tat you find and carry: putting them in bags, putting them in backpacks, putting things in car boots, driving somewhere and unloading it all again. It's like a packing-for-holiday simulator without the holiday.\nFriends help out, but sometimes run back to base for no reason. Others won't let you be their friends but occasionally get sad, even though you're doing all the work. You scavenge the same building four times in one street. The same four lines of dialogue are heard again and again. Enemies spawn endlessly from quest locations. On and on and on.\nFinally comes the best surprise: the game plays itself when you turn it off. All your tiredness goes away (hurrah!), all your stockpiling runs out and all your barracades are taken down (not so hurrah). So that's SOD: it's like my day job. I work hard while others do nothing but get tired, sad or both, the work mounts up faster than I can deal with it, and if I take a day off, I'm twice as busy when I get back.\n4/10.","January 13, 2015","false","3.6"," 53 of 76 people (70%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","70","53","76","9","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cruinne/recommended/241540/","cruinne","cruinne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cruinne/","366 products in account","I've been playing Undead Labs's State of Decay for the past several weeks after nabbing it on sale. The game is a single-player third-person zombie apocalypse sandbox of sorts: while the main game has a storyline to follow, you certainly don't need to follow it and the story won't advance until you do, giving you a lot of time to just poke around.\n\nI have enjoyed the game very much.  It's certainly interesting enough to play and while it starts out reasonably tame, it can get quite difficult.\n\nThe main game begins with your character and a buddy returning to the more civilization-adjacent parts of a national park after a two-week fishing trip only to find that, while you were gone, civilization kind of had a major meltdown.  From there, the game focuses on steath and survival by building up friendships with others and establishing a base from which to operate and outposts to reinforce that base and provide small "safe zones".\n\nCriticisms\nThe criticisms I have are somewhat picky.  To start, the story is very simple and somewhat shallow — it would be easy to play through it relatively quickly and then be just done with the game.  A lot more could have been done, but, as I understand it this was Undead Labs's first game, and it was made for XBox Arcade with all the limitations that requires -- so we will perhaps see more story development in their next full release.\n\nSecond, there just isn't enough information in the tutorial; you feel bombarded with information (because a lot comes in through your Journal) that you can't make much sense of — and then lost because basic information (such as the benefits of establishing an Outpost, or whether it's wise to leave resources in Outposts or loot them thoroughly before setting one up in a location) can be a little difficult to find.\n\nThird, there are too few voice actors, meaning that you end up with the same voice actors' lines being used for several different characters who end up sounding exactly the same while they say (verbatim) the same things; get two of them with the same voice together on a mission and it can get kind of confusing.\n\nFinally: the driving physics and UI need some work.  The game was set up for XBox, so maybe this is where PC players like me start to have problems.  But while I can play Saints Row and Grand Theft Auto and drive just fine, I find the driving in State of Decay frustrating — especially because the smallest mistake can send a car sailing through the air as though it suddenly weighs nothing.  And cars that turn over always explode, so there's that.\n\nPraise\nMeanwhile, though, State of Decay is nice to look at: the colors are just muted enough to evoke the proper autumn at the end-of-the-world feeling, and there has been a lot of attention to detail in filling out the large area (Trumbull Valley) in which your character gets to roam.  There are three small towns to explore, as well as a lot of countryside, with a lot of interesting things to look at if you appreciate the details.\n\nThe game also makes you take a step back and figure out how to survive.  Your character can go stealth or maniac, or pretty much anything in between.  But don't count on the zombies to cooperate since that's sure to get your favorite character eaten nearly every time.  And since death is final, that really makes a difference.\n\nStrategy and sound are important, which I really enjoy, and on top of that there is also resource management to deal with: you've got a base full of survivors who need food, medicine, and ammunition to remain survivors, and construction materials to keep their base up.  Scavenging through the zombie-infested, burnt-out world is a constant necessity.\n\nIn the end, the game is definitely worth a few bucks (especially if you can catch it on sale), and I look forward to other games from Undead Labs.\n\nBreakdown DLC\nI've played several hours of the Breakdown DLC (at level 5, currently), and it's been a lot of fun and a lot of frustration, but the frustration really seems to be the point of it.  It's primarily the sandbox version of the base game, with a couple simple tasks to do to "move to the next level".  Each level, the zombies get more numerous and more difficult to deal with and the scavenge-able resources get harder to find.\n\nIf you don't mind that sort of challenge — the one where you are pretty sure you'll ultimately fail — it can end up being a lot of fun.","October 20, 2014","true","106.9"," 36 of 48 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","36","48","0","2"

The world isn't in any shortage of zombie games, there being even a few survival style ones out there. I'd like to think I've tried most of them as possible even some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ones *coughfortzombiecough*. Typically I'd pass over console titles, but this was different. As a gamer who has played PC games exclusively for around ten years or so I was really biting the bullet when I purchased an XBox and accessories to play just this title alone.\n\nI was not dissappointed.\n\nUndead Labs delivered a title onto XBox live like no other when it came to this particular niche of the zambonie genre. Even with a broken XBox that I had bought cheap, and a knockoff microsoft controller that had it's share of problems I was having a blast. I watched the world around me change as I began ransacking the county, ventiliating craniums along the way. My survivors honed their skills, as they were being equipped better and stockpiling more, still surprising me to this day with how many weapons there are. The empty courtyards of the bases converted into stat boosting facilities. Hordes moved through town, infesting and congregating at buildings. Other survivor groups came and went. Joined us, or were made into lunch. It was quite pleasant. Unfortunately the general overlay of the map does not change, and even then the console hardware wasn't up to snuff to help matters much either.\n\nThen the PC version released. I most certainly was excited to see what was different and when I launched for the first time I was pleasantly surprised. After maxing out the settings it looked like an entirely new game. Through its developement I was a bit salty about the title going to XBox Live, and still think UL would've been better off focusing on it as a PC title to start with but this more than makes up for it.\n\nBreakout launches tomorrow, and I've been watching the updates for it. Its going to be good, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed good.\n\nIf you don't have State of Decay already, you should be ashamed. Its only $20 and you will get your money's worth and then some.

Driving is fairly straightforward, though you can't drive through barriers, making you have to look for the long way around some areas. Honestly, it's a port of an arcade game, so what can you really expect in this regard.\n\nThere's a permadeath feature in this game, which is an interesting feature, but it serves to highlight State of Decay's biggest problem. There's no reason to care about anyone apart from the intro characters because you'll quickly realize that, past some scripted events at the starting base, dialogue between survivors is generic, and the only real personality you get out of any of them is via their stats sheet.\n\nIf the people we're supposed to care about in your game/show/movie/whatever don't have unique personalities,  we have ZERO reason to care about whether they live or die.

State of Decay is a single player only game.\n\nState of Decay gameplay is quite deep, but somewhat repetitive at certain point. At the start of the game, you play as two main characters, Marcus Campbell and Ed Jones as they are ambushed by the living dead. Then you will have a home base where you and other survivors making a stand against the undead. From there, the sandbox play begins. Your home base is where you and your others survivors live, obviously, and it needs supplies to survive. You need to hunt and raid outside to get supplies like foods, medicines, building materials, ammunitions, weapons or fuels. Your home base can also be improved, you can build a workshop, garden, sleeping area and more as long as your home base has the space for them. You can move out from your current home base and find a new bigger or better one too. When you're out there hunting, you may find some neighboring survivors or survivors who may want to join you in your home base. You will also find some driveable civilian vehicles which can also be used as cargo for your scavenged supplies for you to bring home. Your home base will sometimes attacked by approaching zombie hordes. You will need to set up some outpost to defend against these living dead hordes. Outpost will also create a small safe zone outside your home for you to take shelter.\n\nIn State of Decay, survivors can become tired, injured or sick. When that happen to survivors you currently play, better get home and switch to another survivors. Yes, you can switch characters when you have become friends with them. If a survivor gets tired, his/her max stamina will decrease, same goes when he/she is injured. Survivors will also gain some experience and skill as you play with them, such as cardio, wits (ability to search faster but quiet), fighting, shooting and more. But beware if your survivors is killed, their death is permanent. Survivors can be equipped with melee or firearms, whichever you prefer, but melee weapons will gets damaged over time and will be destroyed if not repaired. Firearms can also gets damaged and if not repaired, will become jammed but not destroyed.\n\nGraphics of State of Decay is great, looks good, but not one of those next generation thing. Using CryEngine 3, State of Decay does have good environment view, lightning, good textures, physics and effects. Characters animations are great, when dodging zombies, attacking with melee, it's good. Blood and gore effects are also present in this game, in fact, you can see your survivors getting torn in 2 pieces by the zombies.\n\nState of Decay performance is good, but can use more optimization. At maximum setting, the game sometimes but rarely stutters which can ruin your aim when using a gun. Aiming a gun also seems clumsy and quite hard. Otherwise the performance is good and fine.\n\nIf you're looking for more friendly zombie apocalypse game, then State of Decay is for you, since the game is single player only, you won't find yourself get shot from the back by somebody when you just spawn in the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/goddessv/recommended/241540/","goddessv","VenuS ♡","http://steamcommunity.com/id/goddessv/","188 products in account","You will never get over the beautiful nature and atmosphere in this game. You don't need the YOSE Day One DLC to improve the graphics. I thought they were going to release a normal update but instead they charge you $30 for some simple improvements that you don't need. As for the glitches they aren't bad at all and sometimes aren't even noticeable. It's still beautiful the way it is. If you're one of those people who are into super fast paced massive Rambo shooter garbage games, then this game is not for you. Because it's slow paced and ridiculously relaxing but can also be challenging at the same time. And VERY realistic, because even when you quit the game, it still carries on!\nThis game is a shocker, it's wonderfully made and most probably the best zombie survival game out there. Open world. Excellent vehicle handling and controls. I love the gore. Smooth combats and the NPCs are amazing and not brain-dead. The soundtracks are lovely. And the atmosphere is one of the very best.\nA true feeling of surviving an apocalypse. Scavenging for resources, such as food, medicines, ammo, fuel and materials to improve your base. Building outposts. Setting up traps to prevent the zeds from nearing your home. Requiring skilled people to be able to do things such as repairing the vehicles, creating weapons and explosives, training the survivors, doing experiments and so much more. Meeting other survivors you can help and trade with. You always need to make sure you are well prepared every time you're out on a mission because you never know when you can encounter a horde or the freaks. Zombies can be hilarious with their not so bright brains but can be distracted with lights and noise such as gun shots, cars, sprinting. But what I like the most, is when someone dies, they're really gone. Which is frustrating, but makes you do your best to survive and be better at the game. It's really amazing! There is so much more things to do! I only wish it had Co-op or multi-player, so I can never stop playing it. But still, I can't get enough of it. I highly recommend it and both DLCs. You get to experience the zombie apocalypse as the army in Lifeline. And you get more of State of Decay in Breakdown. And both are very challenging as well and incredibly fun!

But before I get ahead of myself lets break it down.\n\nGraphics are fairly good in my opinion. The specular maps aren't really anything to write home about and the texture resolution will not light the world on fire but for the price and from a small developer they did alright.\n\nThe sound if pretty satisfying. Different guns and bomb have a variety of splody sounds and I'm not really one to care too much about bass or presence...my gaming rig doesn't even have a sound card O_o\n\nStoryline is fairly simple. In the campaign you are a survivor with a friend camping in the mountains when you realize the world has gone to ♥♥♥♥. You meet up with other survivors, find shelter and have quest missions while you try and figure out how to get out of town for good...blah blah blah. To be honest I found the storyline campaign long, and annoying. Far too linear and the fetch quests became really annoying after a while. The rest of this review deals solely with Break Down.\n\nBreakdown is the sandbox version of the story campaign with ALL of the storyline elements and quests removed. It lets you set up a base, and "outposts" around the town that provide a "safe area" where zombies can't spawn into. These outposts can be set up around, food, medical, ammo, or building supplies which can give a bonus to your total supply cache.\n\nScavenging is the major function of this game. Search houses, find anything helpful and take it back to the group. The player is rewarded with "influence" points that allow them to set up more outposts, relocate the base, or perform special actions from special characters within their group. A military character will have an "artillery strike" option. A priest has "words of encouragement" that can remove negative fatigue status from a character. Influence is also needed to remove any supplies a player might take on a scavenging run, guns, ammo, melee weapons, medical supplies or food.\n\nBreak down's goal is to survive until the "escape RV" is located, fixed and supplied. The player then chooses a small group of characters to get on the RV and leave the town. You are then randomly spawned back into the same town and the difficulty increases. More zombies, fewer supplies, harder special zombies.\n\nThere are a LOT of zombies as well as special zombies. Combat becomes a balance of choosing the right weapon for the right characters. (ie: matching the proper weapons with a characters stats.) Using the right moves in combat that will maximize damage output while minimizing the use of stamina. You will meet randomly generated NPC characters that can join your group. The player is capable of switching between characters and infact HAS to in order for previous characters to rest, or heal from wounds.\n\nThis is where the tedium comes in. State of Decay is full of crap, awful characters. You will find drunks, slobs, jerks, sleazeballs and s luts. None of whom will aid you in your survival. You have a maximum number of characters that your base can support and the game quickly turns into a macabre "culling" of the "dead weight" from your group. You can and will take characters out on supply runs and make sure they your ally never returns. Or you may just take direct control of a character and throw them off a cliff to break a leg and be eaten by zombies. You won't do this once, or twice. You will do this as many time as it takes, until the game spawns good characters. The problem is that you don't know the stats of survivors you invite to join you...until they have joined you.\n\nThis can become mind numbingly boring. The environments are HUGE and mostly empty. You will drive for miles into the country, past farms and fields. There are only two towns in the game. Missions and friendly "enclaves" spawn randomly so if you are in the southern most town you can receive a quest on the other end of the freaking map...hope you like driving.\n\nAnother issue is that the game had "Early Access" and I believe it also had a beta and there are still tons of glitches and flaws in this game. There is an active game forum on their website. You can report glitches and the staff is usually quick to respond but I hate small developers turning paying customers into their own game testers. I've been a game tester before and if I'm reproducing a bug for a developer...I'm getting paid for it.\n\nState of Decay Vanilla had tons of bugs, many that crashed the game. Before those were fixed, Break Down DLC came out. The bugs still haven't been fixed and they are releasing their second DLC.\n\nInconclusion, I guess I can't recommend State of Decay. If you can get it bundled 75% off or more on a steam sale or humble indie bundle, go for it. But full price...noooooo.","June 20, 2014","false","167.3"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","21","24","0","0"

Oh, don't we see them so often? The answer is: Yes, HOWEVER, this game takes a new and interesting approach to the apocolypse. Nevermind finding a cure or trying to leave town to some place nice and quiet; State of Decay forces you into a world where the main focus is to fortify a home/base and to live off the surrounding, sometimes desolate buildings. Find food, feed your community members. Find materials, upgrade your base. Find oil, power your generator. Find ammo, defend yourselves from the shambling remains of what used to be your average Joe. Find and rescue other survivors, convince them to join your community. Survive as long as you could as a community. This game makes it clear you need a hand in the end of the world. Now, let's not get too off-topic - this is a review. This brings the question: So why should I get this game?\nWell, although this game had a so-so port from Xbox to PC, although it has semi-frequent glitches, and although it has rather repetetive dialogue, the game makes up for this in many other aspects. I can play this for hours on end, but for the sake of my mental health, I keep each session under 4 hours. This game is great fun, and it can seriously get nerve racking at certain points, whether from the plot or from you just scavenging a town alone. There hasn't been one point in this entire game that I didn't enjoy spending time in the destroyed world that remains. After all, you don't choose the world you live in, but you choose what role you will play in said world.\nAll being said, I highly recommend you give this game a go, and if you like it, get the DLC (but we'll leave the DLC for another review or two).","October 18, 2014","true","24.3"," 35 of 50 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","35","50","0","0"

It doesn't help that the game doesn't pause when you're in the menus, so you can't even take your time to study them or learn what's going on.

They released the entire game in stages selling it as DLC. The simple fact that normal things like basic replayability was sold to us as DLC was absurd enough, but the hostility of their community managers towards the earlier critics of the game is what caught my interest most of all as I take a keen interest in the use of suppression tactics against gaming media who aren't part of the sycophantic love-bomb crowd. You can tell a lot about developers and companies based on the way they handle criticism. Some people, like Squad, will cyber stalk their critics and try to 'expose' them for past misdeeds (in their eyes), others will wear it and even address it and repair their game improving it's standards. In the case of State of Decay it seemed they would actively delete any criticisms they encountered which left me far more cynical of their game overall.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/misspauling/recommended/241540/","misspauling","Cade","http://steamcommunity.com/id/misspauling/","586 products in account","State of Decay is the kind of zombie game I'd been hoping for; equal parts exploration and combat, with sprinkles of RPG on top. Are there flaws? Certainly. Does the game feel complete? Not in all areas, but the core concepts and ideas are so good that in the end (heh), it doesn't leave you feeling as though you got half a product.\nDespite some quirks and an abysmally abrupt ending, I think State of Decay is worth your time and money, and here's why.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nLet's be honest here: this game, like many other games, lives and dies based on its gameplay. There are other factors that are good, but if the gameplay was bad in a game like this, it'd be looked over, maybe rightfully so. Luckily, Undead Labs has nailed almost every single facet of gameplay, from melee and ranged battles all the way to their robust progression and homestead systems. I'll break these down into small sub-sections for readability's sake.\nCOMBAT - RANGED\nState of Decay, like many other games, features both gun-based and melee-based combat, but unlike some, doesn't miss a step with either. The ranged combat is typical TPS fare, but with much more emphasis on ammo conservation and timing your reloads carefully. There are many guns on offer, from rifles and revolvers to shotguns and grenade launchers, and they each have unique handling amongst the many varieties in each type. There are also skills you can unlock to make yourself better at certain types of guns, as well as a handy late-game skill to slow time when aiming, and you can craft and find weapon suppressors that last a certain amount of shots for when you need to headshot some zeds, but not attract dozens of others.\nCOMBAT - MELEE\nThe melee combat is satisfingly meaty, and by the end of the game I felt like there was a lot to it that I hadn't begun to master. With a handful of melee categories, and quite a few weapons in each of those, every swing you take at a shuffling corpse is different, but all of them feel meaty and, dare I say, visceral. There's some limb dismemberment, leading to situations where an undead is still coming at you with both of its arms laying on the ground behind it, but it's all about either decapitating a zombie as it stands or knocking it to the ground to finish it off with a cool animation. There are some skills that tie into the melee as well, including ones that make you excel at a certain kind of weapon, or just sweet knockdown skills, my favorite of which was a low spin-kick that all-but-guaranteed a knockdown on multiple targets, setting up sick combos as I spun and crushed my way to victories. There are durabilities on each melee weapon, unlike guns, but they're pretty abundant so you never feel helpless for long. The only downside to using melee is that it's tied into your universal stamina meter, meaning if you don't make your hits count, you'll quickly be out of breath against zombies that just won't quit.\nMOVEMENT AND VEHICLES\nThe on-foot movement is pretty basic, but the sprinting, climbing, and vaulting over objects is all hooked to your stamina, so not only can you not sprint for long, but sprinting into a fight is a bad idea. You can eventually level up your Cardio over time, but by and large you're going to want to use vehicles for anything that's more than a slight jaunt.\nThe good news is, there are dozens of vehicles, all with different handling and appearances, and driving them is fun as hell, probably because it's never not satisfying to throw open your door into a zombie while you're doing 50MPH across a cornfield. There are some.. curious physics when you collide with something in your car, leading to some amusing crashes where I was thrown, rolling, into the air as my car hit something and did a forwards flip, but by and large the vehicles are well-done and can really get you out of a jam, despite the fact that zombies can climb onto and tear doors off of your vehicle. When this happens, you and your passengers can be pulled out of the car by an especially overzealous zed intent on your destruction.\nPROGRESSION\nProgress in State of Decay is level-based by skill, and each skill levels up by repetition. Kill a bunch of zombies with a gun, your Shooting levels up. Run for miles and you'll be rewarded with a boost to Cardio. It all feels very natural, and at certain levels you'll unlock new skills to help keep you on your feet and help you put the dead back in undead. Each character levels up differently, and some of them have different traits, meaning a few characters might level up shooting quickly, but be bad at Wits, or vice versa. It's a good system, and it means you'll want to swap between characters frequently.\nCHARACTERS AND DEATH\nTo be able to switch to a character, you need to be in Friend status with them, meaning you haven't shot them too many times/nearly ran them over/made decisions they didn't like. It's a basic system, but one that ensures you'll want to keep on everyone's good side so you can use as many characters as possible, especially since death is permanent. When a character dies, they're gone for good, leading to morale losses, but you can pick up some of the stuff they were carrying and bring it to your home base for a slight morale boost, leading me to the next subject: home.\nHOMES\nThe place you'll be spending a lot of time in, bringing supplies to, and upgrading is up to you; there are a variety of home spots after the first main one, and where you want to set up shop is up to you. Personally, after I made my first homebase switch, I felt vaguely annoyed. I'd lost a lot of progress and had to rebuild some facilities, and by the end of the game it didn't seem to have mattered much. A watchtower is all I really needed, so someone could keep zombies from breaking in, and by the time I got that at my second house, the game had very few missions left. Nonetheless, the amount of facilities you can build is pretty good; ranging from sleeping areas to infirmaries and workshops, each one grants bonuses or crafting options, and they can help turn the tide against the undead onslaught. You'll need to find the materials for each, though, and that's a big part of my annoyance with the game, as you'll see next.\nLOOT/SCAVENGING/EXPLORATION\nTo scavenge a shiny, white glowing container, simply walk up to it and hold a button. A small ring pops up, showing how close you are to being done with scavenging that. Holding another button means it goes faster, but is louder and has the chance to make a loud noise, attracting zombies. When it's open, you figure out which stuff is worth taking in your very limited personal inventory, see if there's any Construction Materials/Ammo/Medicine/Food containers inside, which load onto your back and make your stamina drain very fast with sprinting, and back out. You can only carry one of this kind of container at a time, but later you can radio scavengers to come pick up more. It's a fine system and the first 100 times, it's fun to see what kind of things you'll find, but by the end of the game it becomes a chore, especially since materials get scarcer and scarcer, leading you to driving all over the map in hopes of finding a stash of materials to build another upgrade to your house. The constant fetching can be annoying, which I'm about to gripe on further.\n--Continued in comments--\n","January 3, 2014","true","45.1"," 23 of 30 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","23","30","0","12"

But after some time I realised, that's almost the only thing you do, through the whole game and story.\n\nThis game need some changes, the story needs more story, more missions that aren't the same as all the others.\n\nThe graphics are good, the characters are good and the voices are okay, which means this game has potential.","July 4, 2014","true","14.9"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","94","15","16","6","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tecnniqe/recommended/241540/","Tecnniqe","Cheers Love","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tecnniqe/","855 products in account","State of Decay is the open-world third person apocalyptic survival game that I have waited for this whole generation, Day Z and Dead Island were close for me but they both lacked a few things here and there. While DayZ had survival, Dead Island had the world and mechanics, State of Decay have both of these aspects, and pull them off very successfully.\n\nYou quickly realize that the game push a lot of information at you the first few hours, like every home base can only have so many structures, do you want more sleeping areas to keep the characters in the camp rested? Or maybe you want a library to research some better medical aid for when someone get hurt? From this point on the game becomes very dark, it will test your moral. And rightfully so.\n\nEvery now and then you stumble across new survivors, complete strangers in need of help. What are you going to do? Do you help them and risk running out of food? Or do you save them in hope of finding a few food supplies?\nThis also takes us back to the base aspect, you could build a garden instead of a library or sleeping area, as this will give you food daily. Because food each day must be good right? Yes, it is, but if you don't have enough beds for everyone, each character will slow but sure get tired, fatigued. This goes for your playable characters as well as NPCs in the camp.\n\nIf a player character don't rest after a while of exploring, the stamina will decrease, making you worse in combat and increase the chance of dying. Death is permanent, and there is no save/reload feature to abuse. The game autosaves after each finished mission, and that is it.\n\nThe less playable characters you have available, the harder the game gets, because you have less to pick from when the others need a few hours in the bed to rest.\nKeeping a character alive and well will not only serve as a jump option, but they also gain skills and level up depending on what they do. Melee combat? Increase the fighting skill, making you more efficient with melee weapons. Same goes for guns, looting etc.\nHowever should you be unlucky and die, the items you got on you can be retrieved with another character, so don't panic!\n\nYou will meet tough situations where people you know get infected, and we all know how to "fix" that problem. It can be a hard call, depending on the connection with each individual character, the NPC can get overrun while on a supply run you called in, and if you don't help them, may they RIP.\n\nThe game consistently keeps throwing missions/tasks at you, you have to prioritize, which is more important? Save this guy? Or scout this area to call out locations of meds, zeds or maybe you want to find out what the Army is up to.\n\nThe story is also pretty well put together, i keeps you interested, and makes you feel connected with the characters living in the world, making you feel the need to help (most) of them. Helping other survivor outposts will also benefit resources like ammunition, food, construction material etc. But how you play in the world also affect how everyone in the world watch you, reckless driving is negative and will make everyone look at you in a bad way, same goes for reckless shooting. But in the end, it's all about survival, keeping morale up, food on the table and killing the zeds!","September 21, 2013","true","25.5"," 25 of 34 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","25","34","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/241540/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","While those interested in the burgeoning zombie survival sandbox genre have no shortage of titles to partake of, those seeking a solo experience have been left with few options, particularly on the PC. Multiplayer games inspired by the Arma 2 mod, Dayz, seem to be popping up everywhere but the appreciable potential for a singleplayer game that focuses on PvE rather than PvP has on the platform gone unfulfilled. State of Decay looks to cash in on this opening, offering up a sizable chunk of game world populated by zombies, AI survivors and lots of loot-filled buildings to scour. While there are more than a few rough edges in State of Decay and a lack of the heart-stopping tension found in Dayz, there is an engrossing and enjoyable game here with a lot of things to do given the low cost of entry.\n\nThe start of the game sees you fighting zombies and completing simple fetch quests for a small group of survivors garrisoned in a ranger station. You are introduced to the combat and looting mechanics, but these only garnish the more engaging aspects of the experience. Soon you find yourself entwined with a larger group of survivors holed up in a church just outside a small town. This will serve as your base throughout most of the game as you earn the trust of fellow survivors, fortify your encampment and go out in search of supplies. Ensuring the well being of this group of survivors is ultimately what keeps State of Decay moving forward, as it provides good incentive for you to engage in the gameplay tasks which without context would be fairly banal.\n\nAfter the opening sequence of the game, the constant flood of missions that you are informed of via radio chatter take a back seat to exploration and looting. Ensuring that your group of survivors have enough food and medical supplies will be the most pressing issue, and can be remedied by searching through houses which may contain zombies, supplies or occasionally survivors who can be convinced to join your group. You can climb tall objects and 'survey' the surrounding area, revealing locations of interest. Once inside a building, objects which contain items must be searched, and this takes several seconds to complete. Whether you try and sneak around avoiding combat with the walking undead, quietly scavenging what you need, or go in swinging to clear a house of its decrepit occupants before searching for goodies remains entirely up to you. You can radio home to request an AI survivor come out and pick up the supplies for you, but this requires clearing a location of all zombies first.\n\nIf you decide to clear a location of zombies before poking around for loot, the combat is functional but uninspired. With a melee weapon you swing away until either you run out of stamina, the zombies' heads explode or your weapon breaks. If you manage to knock a zombie down you can finish it off with a brutal swing of your chosen instrument of death, but most of the challenge lies in ensuring you don't get surrounded or backed into a corner. Firearms are straightforward and satisfying to use, although ammunition isn't readily available and firing a unsilenced weapon will attract nearby zombies, meaning they are best used only when the situation gets out of hand. Sneaking around zombies is a viable method, particularly when dealing with larger groups, and can be accomplished by takedowns from behind, distracting zombies with objects or using firearms with home-made silencers that only last for a set number of shots.\n\nThe zombies themselves shamble around convincingly enough, at least until they get stuck in the terrain which happens all too frequently. The undead will hop through windows, climb fences and grab you from behind as they endeavor to end your life. Special zombie types eventually start showing up, which range from the bullet-proof SWAT zombies to ones that explode in a cloud of poisonous gas when killed to hulking beasts that charge like bulls and sponge up a lot of firepower before going down.\n\nIf you do get killed, which happens very infrequently, rather than reverting to an old save you will start playing as another survivor in your group. It is in your best interest to keep survivors alive for as long as possible since you gradually gain passive improvements to a character over time, such as improved stamina, melee damage and increased health. If you are out and about with one character for too long, their maximum stamina will be decreased until they go back to the base and rest. When you do this, you will take control of a different survivor, meaning you will end up playing as many different characters throughout the game.\n\nWhile the explorable area in State of Decay isn't huge, you can enter and drive vehicles left lying around which are all conveniently unlocked with keys in the ignition. Driving a car feels responsive and light almost to a fault; if you crash into an object at speed your vehicle will go flying in some pretty crazy ways. Running over zombies is a very effective way of killing them, although cars will become damaged in the process. Zombie hordes roam the streets, and running into them at full speed will be as damaging to your vehicle as it will be to the shambling flesh-eaters.\n\nThe amount of time you spend on State of Decay is linked directly to how invested you become in the well-being of your survivor group as well as your tolerance for repetition given there is no real end to the game but the random objectives start repeating. It takes a good amount of time and scavenging to fully upgrade your survivor camp with an infirmary, vehicle-repair station and watchtowers among other fortifications, but if you don't buy into the well being of your AI dependants you will struggle to care enough to go through the trouble of collecting all the required materials.\n\nIf you have been looking for a zombie-themed survival sandbox but don't want to contend with bandits and hackers in online games, State of Decay will scratch that itch. The lack of tension in exploration is vindicated by fairly complex mechanics surrounding the well-being of a group of survivors you must watch over. State of Decay succeeds in its ambitions and despite some rough edges provides a compelling open world experience.\n\nRecommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","November 24, 2014","true","40.5"," 74 of 122 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","74","122","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/redruler/recommended/241540/","redruler","Redruler","http://steamcommunity.com/id/redruler/","586 products in account","State of Decay is a GTA-esque zombie survival game.  You play as a group of survivors who must search for supplies and safe-houses while the main storyline unfolds.\n\nEven though it’s another zombie game, this one does a whole lot of things right.  The story is almost generic but game play is quite enjoyable and after a while you really care for your crew.  It is devastating to lose a character after working so hard to level up his/her skills.  And dead means dead people.  No going back to reload saves here.\n\nThere are several RPG elements, not only for your characters but for upgrading your base as well.  The game also added a touch of realism by having people get tired which temporarily gives them a greater and greater stamina penalty until they rest.\n\nThe above being said, the game does have a large number of bugs still present, from clipping, to map glitches, to even crashing every now and then.  Also, this game BEGS to be co-op.  It would have been fantastic to go out and scavenge supplies and run over zombies with friends.  Sadly, the devs have stated that it would take too much to add co-op to the game at this point.  Huge missed opportunity there.\n\nIssues and all, there is no buyer’s remorse.

Keeping your group up to date with supplies, keeping your survivors from going insane, and keeping things mellow, are some of the tasks the player upholds when they first start their game.\n\nThe player does not play as a single character, or a 'god' that overwatches the community, but rather the community itself. The base concept is that you gain enough trust with a person to befriend them, at which point you can switch back and forth between the characters you have befriended to take advantage of everybody in your friendgroup. There is no single main character, although the player can choose to concentrate on a single person. The twist here is that when characters die, they are dead forever, and won't come back.\n\nWhen playing the game, the player upholds a third person perspective with whatever person they are playing as. You can loot and scavenge, clear areas, set up outposts, scout out areas to add icons to your map, and much, much more.\n\nThis game is one of those games that will leave you in doubt considering how much content it actually has versus how much you would think it didn't from a distance. There is so much going on in this game it is easy to miss the minor features here and there. From a distance, one may think it is just a third person combat-based shooter. But if they put any more than an hour into the game, and actually saw what the game had to offer, you would rethink your entire perspective in a single matter of visiting the base management screen.\n\nWhat I'm trying to get at is that the game does not start strong with the story mode. The game gives you the illusion that you are playing a game where you just follow a line of missions where you just go from mission to mission until eventually beating the game. Until you reach the church (The base and group the story mode gives you to start), it will seem like that. The game does not provide convinient tutorial on the game's content, leaving it up to the player to realize that they aren't playing a linear game maybe 3 hours since they started.\n\nThere is a 'random bank' of survivors to ensure that the player will not end up with the same people every time (unless they are counting the story characters from story mode), there is no set spots for certain items to spawn, and every game playthrough you go through will be noteably different.\n\nThe game generates missions based on what is needed or if the player hasn't tended to a growing problem. If you leave a guy to wallow in his anger for a long time, he will be at risk of snapping, giving the player the option to try to talk them down from their bad mood, or ask them to leave, as an example of this. Other survivors you aren't playing as can ask you for help, or you can even ask them for help as well.\n\nThe game does not use money currency or anything like that, you use your influence in the group to make descisions and take things. This also means that you definitely do not start in the decision-making ranks, meaning that you will have to play it for a little bit before you gain the trust needed to make the big move to the bigger compound, stop that zed hunt, etc. Influence can be gained for sticking around for a while and doing a lot of influence-gaining tasks. Be involved with your group, and your group will be involved with you. It's not a game where you can screw around and hope your bros will survive.\n\nThat's the one bad thing - you can't really screw around when driving that car off a cliff will destroy it permanently or the fact that ammo is really rare. It depends on what your motives for playing are.\n\nWhile I recommend this game, I must warn you that it requires time and goes off of a real-time simulation. Survivors will gather little supplies daily, or you might get lucky, but there is daily rates of consumption of each material depending on what your setup is. Maintenance may be required, but usually your group will make it. It's nothing you can't handle.\n\nGet this game if you have the time. If you are looking for something combat-based that you can play in an hour and not have to worry about anything, go play something else.","February 24, 2014","true","264.6"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","18","23","0","2"

Mere seconds past the Start screen, it throws you headlong into a zombie apocalypse in full bloom. Tree branch in hand, you clobber the shambling corpses attempting to munch on your screaming camping buddy, and then seek out the few remaining survivors while scrounging for supplies, weapons, and ever-safer home bases. That's just the first 20 minutes, but the core of State of Decay's gameplay never changes as you make your way through its open world and battle an endless cast of zombies. State of Decay finds its soul in the dreary repetition of apocalyptic survival.State of Decay's open world manages a substantial degree of immersion, complete with an expansive and occasionally intimidating map and the ability to drive cars freely across the landscape. The cars handle poorly, but the ability to use them to mow down roving zombie swarms offers a malicious satisfaction. You quickly learn to fight zombies only if you absolutely have to in State of Decay, and therein lies much of its appeal. This is not a game about Bruce Campbell badassing about in Evil Dead; it's a celebration of the normal person and all of his or her associated weaknesses. Some of the characters you come across have no combat experience at all.Death is permanent in State of Decay, which means that even characters with fully voiced storylines and unique dialogue die forever if you let them get overrun. From there, you can only continue through the eyes of another character you've befriended.Few things add more tension to State of Decay than the terrifying noise guns make, because a single foolish shot can bring an unmanageable horde upon you.Permanent death is a smart addition, though, since losing characters with high skills across the board carries with it a real sense of loss, particularly if their voice quests and customized responses in some quests led you to believe they were an essential character. Sometimes they don't even have to die in the field; if a character you've been controlling sustains enough injuries--a few undead chomps don't result in instant zombification in State of Decay--he'll lie bedridden and useless at your home base. The good news is that the need to rest and switch out characters results in you amassing a balanced group of playable characters anyway.It's a bit strange that a game that places such a heavy emphasis on interpersonal relationships should have no cooperative mode. You spend your time with State of Decay alone, joining up with other NPCs only for specialized quests and escort missions that bring other survivors back to your current base camp. It's especially odd since State of Decay starts out with a party of two, suggesting that you'll always have a buddy at your side if need be.State of Decay serves up a near constant barrage of suspense and immersion that leaves even the briefest jaunts away from your home base tinged with the threat of death. Its flaws are numerous and impossible to ignore, but in spite of them, State of Decay is a captivating survival adventure set in a bleak and harrowing world.","December 4, 2014","true","90.2"," 50 of 81 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","50","81","2","0"

Oh wait.\n\nAs you have probably already guessed, this is a cross-species relationship simulator where you spend roughly about twenty hours of game time bashing your former loved ones and neighbors in the teeth with a rusty pipe wrench. Over and over again. Oh, and don't forget to rob their house while you're at it! That's it. That's the entire game. Honest.\n\nIn all seriousness, this is by far the best open-world zombie survival simulator around, on a par with Project Zomboid, but let me be (for real this time) honest there for a moment. It gets repetitive. It offers nothing new to the zombie apocalypse genre, story wise. It's full of (albeit, hilarious) geometry glitches. But then again, so is Skyrim! Yet it's a great game. So what's so special about SoD, anyways? Well, for one, how about tossing a creepy-♥♥♥ talking doll into the midst of a zombie horde to keep them entertained while you rummage through somebody's underwear in search for an aspirin? B*tches love talking dolls. Still not enough? Fine.\n\nSoD, much like The Walking Dead, has a great deal of realism added to it. Resources you scavenge, for once, play a huge role in the game and your characters aren't unstoppable killing machines - if they die, they die permanently. SoD has quite a heavy emphasis on strategic micromanagement, instead of being just another run-n-gun. Finding a suitable home base, upgrading its facilities, going on exhausting day-to-day scavenging runs, and keeping morale up is essential, and what makes the game incredibly fun. The story... Well, it's there. Alongside with everyone's favorite Plucky Comic Relief trope (Barry Wheeler? Joe Barbaro? Yeah.). But anyways.\n\nLooking for a highly immersive zombie apocalypse experience? Look no further. Just one word of caution, it's highly addictive. And if you're a true masochist, try out the Breakdown DLC, which ramps up the difficulty and removes the story altogether, focusing solely on the survival aspect. Just don't forget to tell your mommy you won't be coming for dinner.\n\nToo busy trying not to become one, amirite. She'll understand.\n\nP.S. For those still having doubts, Lifeline DLC is a super nice (and surprisingly cheap!) addition, since it FINALLY features a whole new map for you to explore: I'll go so far as to say that it's worth buying just for the map alone, and if you get it on sale then it's just a steal. My only complaint is that you don't have a lot of freedom during the story since you're on the clock pretty much 24/7.

For regular gamers this game will get real boring, real fast.  Its all a series of fetch quests, then again that is what survival is, get food, building supplies and other stuff to keep your survivors alive.  This game has permadeath where once a survivor dies their gone for good.  Also the game plays itself or something when its turned off or if the player stops playing the game keeps playing itself.  While the developer on their forums wrote up this long post about how its impossible to remove, ignore the dev, and just download a mod because there are tons that disable the game from playing itself.\n\nThe game is very unique, and its a HUGE world.  There is alot of dialog in this game, its pretty impressive really.  Finally a zombie game that is PVE, not that PVP crap like other games which is just any FPS deathmatch game with zombies.  This is a game based on survival.  There are some flaws in this game.  For example if you loot a house of stuff or search it, the house can never be searched again.  But if you kill the zombies those in that house, those will come back again and again.  So its kind of out of balance that way, even the cars wont respawn.\n\nRegular People:  1/10  Value:  $4.99\nZombie Fans:  7/10   Value:  $9.99","March 6, 2014","true","127.3"," 20 of 27 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","20","27","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NakedSpaceMan/recommended/241540/","NakedSpaceMan","NakedSpaceMan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NakedSpaceMan/","353 products in account","This review is based on playing the game with all DLC:\nQuite frankly one of the best zombie survival games I've played in an extremely long time. While it suffers from some bizzare design choices, it still as a whole presents a zombie survival simulator that isn't just about bashing zombie's brains in.\n\n\nThe base game:The base game with no DLC is a solid experience. It starts you off in a tutorial area to teach you the basics of the game, killing zombies. When it comes to interaction with zombies you have three choices. Fight, run, or sneak by. Fighting is pretty good in the game but it kinda suffers from dependancy on weapons. The game does have abilities for the survivors to use their own physical skills like punching and kicking to take out zombies, but they don't do much damage. You're basically forced to use a weapon, whether it be a melee weapon or a gun. But since finding a weapon is extremely easy, that's not necessarily a bad thing.\n\nUsing guns also is a great experience. Each weapon feels distinctive and while some are weak like low caliber pistols, others make you feel like Rick Grimes from The Walking Dead. Guns also adhear to a noise system. If you fire a gun, you attract zombies from far and wide. However guns are extremely powerful against the special zombies in the game so the balance of when to and when not to use a gun is a constant concern.\n\nAs said before, there are special zombies in the game. If you've played Left 4 Dead you probably know what to expect. The tank, the attracter, the predator, and the stunner. There are other special types, but they're basically just regular zombies that can't be killed by guns. And while it's starting to get annoying for zombie games to always have special zombie types, at least in State of Decay they're more rarer than in other games.\n\nNext is my most favorite part of the game, base and resource management. In the game, just like in real life, there's a constant need for materials. Whether it be food or construction materials or ammo, your community needs supplies in order to stay alive. If you don't keep up with the demand, your base will fall. There's no work around, you have to scavenge houses and buisnesses to find supplies. When you do find supply crates you have two options, you can carry the crate in a pack on your back and take it back to base for upkeep in your base or you can break it open and put whatever's inside into storage at base. You don't get upkeep on your base but you get what's inside, be it ammo or food or whatever it may have.\n\nFinally there's the story. The game takes place at the near beginning of the zombie apocalypse. You and your friends have to work together to survive as long as you can while trying to figure out a way out of the valley you're trapped in. Along the way you meet other survivors. Some you can recruit into your community to help you while others have their own thing going that you can be friends with, or enemies. Doing most of the side missions involving the other communities are optional but if you help them, they'll help you with all sorts of abilites. One for example can drop motars on a group of zombies while another can deliever a car wherever you need. The main storyline is also very well made with an end game challenge that actually made me want to rage quit, something that rarely happens anymore with games getting easier. The ending also is extremely great considering what's on the horizon for the developer that made the game, Undead Labs. I won't spoil it for you but let's just say if you love the game and want more when the sequel comes out, it may be worth it to get an Xbox ONE, assuming of course Microsoft keeps it's word and makes the sequel Xbox exclusive.\n\nNow for those bizzare design choices I mentioned. As I said before, base management is my favorite part of the game. But unfortunately the tutorial is a little lack luster and sometimes confusing. It sometimes explains too much in some areas without explaining enough in others. What's the benefit of having construction A in the base over construction B? Also the choice of allowing the safe zone to become so big through the establishment of outposts is kinda weird to me. Don't get me wrong, not having to worry about my base while I'm across the map is great, but it kinda takes away the fear of being overrun in a setting that's absolutely perfect for that kind of fear.\n\nAll in all, it's still worth buying just for the base game alone. Especially when it's on sale and even more especially if you decide to use some mods for the game.\n\n\nBreakdown DLC:This DLC alone is worth buying the game. It's basically the base game except there's no time constrictons and you're free to do whatever you want. The challenge is unlocking all the playable characters through certain actions. In the first playthrough you have to say, kill 5 special zombies to unlock a character. Overtime you'll unlock all the characters you can in that playthough and be allowed to move up to the next. In level 2, zombies are harder to kill and there's more special infected. But there's more challenges, unlocking better survivors. The constant challenge of an increasingly harder game is alone worth playing while unlocking the better newer characters is just a great cherry on top. While some have criticize the DLC for not doing much in terms of changing the game, I say it's perfect for those that want a long term challenge.\n\n\nLifeline DLC:This DLC quite frankly will test everything you learned from the other parts of the game. This time it's an entirely new campaign you'll be playing. No old characters are rehashed and you even play in a new map. Quite possibly the worst case scenario map to play in a game like this, an urban city. Zombies are EVERYWHERE! Sneaking is now not just an option, it's a necessity in this densily populated area. The campaign is also surperb in delivery based on what characters you play as and the base building and maintaining is still my most favorite part. But the biggest challenge is, again the population of the map. Firing weapons is just a big no no on this map as every zombie within a mile is gonna hear it, even though ironically you start off with all the guns and ammo you could ask for. If you're looking for the ultimate challenge in urban zombie survival, this is the DLC for you. Just don't be surprised if you find yourself yelling in terror about all the zombies running at you.","October 6, 2014","true","36.5"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

Idk if they intend to release more dlcs)\n\nThe base game is a fun, gritty experience at a post apocalyptic world where zombies overrun the world and you control survivors and try to tough it out and survive. Your decisions have weight and consequences, whether you choose to handle a situation as soon as you get into it or delay your decision, there are consequences that will affect your game in ways that amaze me. Though i really dislike the fact that the zombies themselves can run, there are mods for that. Sure the unmodded experience is fun too but i feel like mods tend to enhance gameplay. I myself installed several, mostly ones that make the zombie population a lot more dense and force them to shamble and walk towards you.\n\nAdds a lot of tension as you try to mow down zombies with a table leg you just found in a house you were scavenging. Every hit exhausts you, you run and hope they don't catch up. You panic as you keep running to avoid your death at the hands of the zeds.\nYou get back to your home base, you build more improvements and go over your plans to hit the next few houses for supplies and maybe even radio other survivors. And for a moment, you feel safe and sound. Until a siege comes along.\n\nWhat i think that this game does best is make the player emotionally invest in the characters.\nYou grow attached to a certain survivor and you want to see him/her make it out. You grow attached to some survivors and you do everything you can so that they survive. When i had to put down a few survivors because they were infected, that really hit me hard in the feels.\nand i was pretty bummed when my chosen survivor got torn in half by a horde during a scavenging mission gone terribly wrong. Good job Undead Labs.\n\nThough after my main survivor died, i kinda didn't touch the game again.\n:<","August 27, 2014","true","21.7"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","17","22","0","0"

Takes some getting used to the menus and features, but is well worth taking the time and effort. A few features are annoying, like the frequency of random events and requests bogging down the ability to just explore and enjoy (it seems the developers are more used to creating quest-driven games and aren't too comfortable with open worlds), and there are some bugs that the dev team seems uninterested in addressing. But the game is otherwise so fine I'm willing to put up with these.\n\nSo why not recommended? Because this is sadly a classic case of a company taking horrid, blatant advantage of their supporters. I bought the game in early access PC port mode, and what do us loyal fans get in return? Refusals to fix bugs, DLC that adds very little and refuses to fix bugs, and then a massive re-release that is just a slight visual upgrade that yet again refuses to address bugs and - big surprise - early access peeps don't get access to.\n\nNewsflash, video game developers: Giving someone early access is an implicit contract that (1) you will actually finish the game, and (2) your early supporters are supplied with upgraded versions as the game further develops.\n\nUndead Labs has clearly decided to abandon their project and just soak up whatever money they can from the suckers. It is painfully obvious they had no intention to actually finish the game once the money started rolling in. They - and especially founder Jeff Stray - are dead to me.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/copons/recommended/241540/","copons","Copons","http://steamcommunity.com/id/copons/","727 products in account","State of Decay is a fairly fun game, based on a mix of third person action, micromanagement, gathering quests and a great amount of repetitions, both visual (there is just a small textures and buildings core, the rest is a copy of it) and situational (there are like 3 or 4 different types of side quests, popping up a dozen every hour).\n\nAll in all, I appreciated the ride for the most part, got bored every now and then doing always the same couple of things over and over again, kinda hated the performance issues (60 to 15 framerate drops during loadings are a tad too annoying while driving) and got absurdly underwhelmed by the ending (likely the worst thing of the entire game, and not because it's bad, but it's just so useless and badly realized that they could just have cut it out and settled for an infinite survival sim).\n\nIt's clear Undead Labs were aiming extremely high, and I think it's also clear it was too high for them to actually pull off.","January 4, 2015","true","16.1"," 24 of 36 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","24","36","0","1"

Its awesome! Like any game though, it has its ups and downs.\n\n- The game captures some incredible survival atmosphere. Scavenging to survive and keeping quiet while doing so is the key to gathering massive tons of precious loot. Such loot is not infinite, even if seemingly abundunt in the beginning, albiet difficult to get to sometimes with so many zombies on the prowl. The game tries to make it difficult but its quite easily beat once you learn the controls and how you manage your play. The minimap also makes it a little easier to spot zombies before they come for you.\n\n- Sound is your greatest enemy. The louder the sound, the more zombies you'll attract, and its almost impossible to come out of a running horde's charge unscathed (unless you're willing to waste precious ammo, or are smart enough to lure them into the radius of an outpost). This mechanic makes it that more fun and challenging to play around with, since almost everything you do will produce some kind of sound. That being said, its a good idea to be smart and patient. Sometimes, its better to walk than to drive a car, and better to melee than shooting a gun.\n\n- Guns are somehow easily obtainable from midgame onwards, although many dont account to anything unless you make headshots count. Missing or shooting without a silencer is almost a sure fire way of getting yourself swarmed. Two words that describe the ultimate in the late game finale: grenade launcher!\n\n- Every survivor is unique. Nobody looks the same as the other. Their initial skills and specialities also vary greatly, with some colourful extra skills to give that survivor their own unique flavour. You can switch to almost ANYBODY you pick up, as long as you take the time to earn their trust through missions and good deeds first. A number of the voiceovers for survivors are recycled, though, unless if its a major NPC with special dialogue. My other gripe is that its impossible to trade between characters. Stuff can only be traded through the stash and character switching.\n\n- Death is horrifyingly gruesome. When your health bar depletes, you go into a kind of button mashing recovery mode with all these zombies ripping at you. When you recover, your max health is reduced. Go down again and it will keep decreasing as they keep hitting you. When it reaches zero, your hapless survivor literally gets torn apart. Once you see it (for the achievement), you probably wont want to see it again. Its also a waste of a very precious resource. Your survivors are the ones that get things done, and losing them will make it a lot more difficult to play. Unlike loot, getting survivors to join you can also be quite difficult after a certain point. You'll also have to think about the amount of living space and food supply you have in your base. If you dont have enough, it will cause people to leave.\n\n- Missions can be repetitive, but its always fun to work out how to best tackle a situation without using too many meds or foods to boost health or stamina, or whether to stealth it or charge it. When you swing a melee weapon or perform executions on zombies, you use some stamina, which can quickly deplete if you're swarmed. No stamina almost always means a quick death if without food. Seriously. You wont even be able run away.\n\n- Although its already in a final build, there are still issues with clipping. Zombies and survivors get stuck in walls and in the ground. They wont be stuck for long, at least from what I have experianced. So far, its mostly tolerable.\n\n- After finishing the main storyline, you can purchase the DLC for a kind of endless sandbox game. The objective is to survive as long as possible. Moving bases will increase the difficulty, though Im not sure how. Im on the verge of completing the main campaign at this moment, and will be down for one of these soonish.\n\nOverall, I will give this game an 8/10. As far as single player zombie survival games go, I would think that this is what a proper one should look and play like. It would be interesting, however, to see how a game like this could fare as a multiplayer game. I would think that a number of player controlled communities, each competing for scavenged loot in an area, could make things even more interesting.","December 18, 2013","true","89.9"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

This game gives you the choice between good and evil, and shows someone's true colors... when they play the game seriously.\n\n\nTL;DRI highly recommend this game. There's so many little details that you miss on you first dozen play through that when you see it you go "Why didn't i notice that before?". This game is aggravating. This game makes you feel like you are actually immersed into this world, and it's quite terrifying.\n\nPros\n+Non Linear Storyline\nThis games storyline (For Base game and Lifeline- Breakdown does not have a storyline at all) is very unique, and you can fail missions to continue the story as well.\n\n+Every playthough is different\nI have yet to find get the same playthough in my 40+ hours on steam.\n\n+You control a community\nUnlike other zombie games, this one is more focused on the community aspect instead of a "Lone Survivor" type game.\n\n+Perma death\nIf you lose a character, they are gone.

Over-saturated colors with ridiculously high contrast turn everything into a colorful blur, and the game has almost zero configuration options.\n\nAdd this to the fact that they are re-releasing the game with major patches and bug-fixes, and charging full price for another game rather than fixing what people already paid for?

It's very close to what I always imagined the ideal zombie apocalypse survival game to be. And it's not just combat, combat, combat, this game makes you feel hunted and the moments of dramatic tension that arise naturally as you're sneaking around are great.\n\nThere's an excellent balance between realism and action, a rich setting packed full of references and amusing little details, and clever use of noise as a gameplay element (loud noises can attract zombies from all over, which is often a risk, but also gives rise to tactics like the use of noise to lure or distract enemies). I also liked the combination of multiple playable characters and permanent death, if you get your character killed, it's final - they're dead and gone, and you'll have to play someone else from their group. It really feels like a loss when a survivor you've been building up into a badass gets torn apart in a raid gone horribly wrong.\n\nOwing to its small budget, it's a bit rough around the edges, but it has a heart of gold and a lot of ambition. At first I thought "another zombie game?" but this was a breath of fresh air to me.","December 24, 2013","true","894.9"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sunbellow/recommended/241540/","sunbellow","King.Elvis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sunbellow/","328 products in account","Rating: 8 out of 10\n(I'm still playing breakdown right now, so the whole views are about the original game.)\nI would recommend you this game if you like games like DayZ but get tired of getting killed without any reasons.\nI've played for like 20 more hours in 3 days and I love this game. However, to be honest, there are lots of things which could be improved about this game.\nPros:\n1, The graphic is good.\n\n2, The bgms are appropriate for the atmosphere.\n\n3, Gameplay is fluent and comfortable, though I would recommend you to play this game with a controller.\n\n4, There are main quests and side quests which keep you having objects to achieve (They're fun at the beginning). For instance, you may choose to help neighbor to earn their trust in order to make progress of making them join you or you may choose to search for resources to build more facilities at home or you could kill zombies in order to get your skill level up.(I love the sound effect of blowing up zombie heads and slow motion of finishing them)\n\n5, There are different types of special zombies, which are obstacles for new players at night or during defense quests from neighbors.\n\nCons:\n1, This game is still not gonna be an amazing game which wouldn't make you feel repetitive about its goals and quests. Also, the main quests are too weak to even be considered as main quests. However, it's contradictory that you will find main quests are so short after you finish them because you would expect a lot more from main quests while the game doesn't offer many different quests after you play for a while. Then, what's the purpose of main quests anyway? just to tell you you need to move somewhere with some reasons? Or just try to create a fake sanse of progress with repetitive quests? After beating the game, I could also say the ending isn't like an ending. It's like a shutting down right from your face when you just wonder what's gonna happen next and bang, the game ends...\n\n2, Though there are special zombies, they're not hard after you play for a while and figure out how to battle with them. To be honest, it's fair and it fits the realistic surviving atmosphere. But, it's really boring to fight against them. I would like to say that since this game doesn't bring many conflicts between people and communities (Like pvp in DayZ but with bots), I would like to see more and harder special zombies in this game to make this game more challenging. Not only several types of special zombies but a lot more should be put in. Also, I think it's gonna be great if some special zombies are gonna appear after you continue finishing main quests. Using them to represent an increasing difficulty and challenge of this game would make people who like to shoot feel more interested in making progress in this game. And yes, we need a big ♥♥♥ boss zombie to attack our base to make it more like a community and a raid. Imagine the difference between you walk on the street alone with badass guns and you sneak on the street to hunt down some big ♥♥♥ zombies with your people. I really would like to see the latter.\n\n3, Side quests could be much better. I would like to see more details about side quests of different people. I believe there are lots to develop about humanities and societies. It's not only big things between different communities but small details about each person. Their feelings, their memories, and their beliefs could all be developed more. A family picture in a house, dead body of couples with hands holding each other, or even a lonely, weak and hungry dog standing near its suicide owner , scenes like these could be put in this game a lot to make gamers feel more desperate when they do their searching in different houses. And then you shall put some inspiring side quests by contrast to make gamers into the game. Zombies and weapons are all about gameplay. People, communities and their stories are creating the atmosphere of this game. When Skyrim is favored by lots of people but more buggy than this game, the importance of side quests should be taken into account.\n\nAfter all, it's a good game and a good try. Thie game still has its potential and I really hope this game could be amazing in this genre.","January 4, 2014","true","38.8"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gosedre/recommended/241540/","gosedre","Gosedre","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gosedre/","215 products in account","This game mixes part zombie horror/survival with some city building and people management. The game starts with you taking control of a couple guys coming back from a remote fishing trip to find out that the area they are in is now in the middle of a zombie outbreak. You meet up with other survivors and try to get enough supplies and weapons to survive long enough to..... well I'm not sure to what end cause I'm pretty sure I screwed up somehow and wasn't sure what happened but I got to the end game screen.\n\nI recommend this game because it was fun to play. I've played it on both Console and PC and both times the game was enjoyable. That being said there was some design decisions that made sense for the game I guess, but just didn't sit well with me. Slight SPOILERS ahead I guess.\n\nThe game is constantly forcing you to do things, there is never seems to be a break. There is always someone in trouble getting supplies, or someone missing or someone who wants to take out a zombie infestation. While you are doing those misssions there are also story missions that are happening and this game doesn't care what else you are doing, if you don't show up for that story mission someone is gonna die and that part of the storyline is gone. The problem with all these side/main quests happening ALL the time is it doesn't just let you explore the game. The map is a pretty decent size with some neat areas to find and explore. The problem is that you don't want to be on the northwest corner of the map when a story mission suddenly pops up on the southeast corner. Maybe I just failed at seeing the options to tell the people in my little fortification to just sit there and don't leave but it was annoying to have these quests pop up all the time. Made the game probably a little more of a realistic zombie game but from a guy who likes exploring, the way these side quests worked just didn't work for me.\n\nI did really enjoy the way the inventory worked in this game, it was really well done. You can get different sizes of backpack, though you'll pretty well get the biggest size pretty quickly and that is usually enough to get the job done. You also get the trunk of the vehilce that you're driving (if you use a vehicle to get around). In addition you can carry one bag of supplies (again the trunk of the vehicle can store multiple bags). Anything that you find can be stored into the community inventory which gives you influence points (instead of using money), so you can trade things you find for other things in the community inventory(either things that were there originally or things that other survivors have made). Finishing various side quests or main quests will also give you points to get additional items out of the inventory. If you get the big bag and use the vehicles trunks/box efficiently you'll have enough points for pretty well anything you'll ever need.\n\nThe Zombies were pretty standard zombies, they moved at about the same pace as your characters but could be out run with sprinting, however you can only sprint for a limited amount of time. There are also several different types of zombies in addition to the average ones ranging from super large/strong to super fast/aggresive and more. But none of them felt over powering or cheesy in some way. The fit the game really well. As well they reacted decently to your actions for the most part. Driving, sprinting or shooting would all draw in zombies from surrounding areas, pretty standard zombie logic.\n\nYou can play as a variety of characters from your base and level each one of them up. Each character is not exactly unique, they have some individual traits but are pretty interchangable. The amount of playable characters is decent as each of your characters may become tired/hungry/sick if they've done a lot of exploring or fighting and adds a bit of realisim to the game. You can either choose to use items to recharge them or switch out characters to let them rest. Only problem again with this is relating back to the questing point. One of the characters you use might decide to go off questing while you are playing as another character and then they won't recharge as well.\n\nThe one thing I found lacking is that the story is pretty forgetable. There are some choices in there that will affect your game and the story but for the most part it's pretty standard zombie game. Survive for a while and then get the heck out of there.\n\nControls are decent enough, Camera can be a little stupid at times but for the most part never really bothered me.","January 21, 2015","true","68.6"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","11","13","2","0"

Want to stay with a group of survivors in a church? Go ahead, help them and earn their trust. Want to kill them all, loot their resources and start your own base? Go ahead, have fun!\n\nThe combat itself is nowhere near as bad as I thought, it reminds me a lot of a basic version of the Assassin's Creed combat, with an option of using guns of course.

Currying favor, stemming infighting and trying to bring in increasing numbers of divergent people under one banner? oh yes.

It really lacks polish, well..  that's being generous, it's just really rough around the edges.\n\n\nThe good stuff:\n\n- You can control multiple characters - change between the survivors at home base. They have their own loadout and XP based skillset.\n\n- Permadeath - it REALLY intensifies the experience when you're on a mission, and all of a sudden you are low on health, exhausted and struggling to reach your car parked outside while a horde is on your heels.  I lost a couple of experienced survivors that way - I simply underestimated the danger and paid the cost. But learned to park close by, facing the right direction :)\n\n- Place outposts, and customize/upgrade your home base\n\n- Lots of different interesting weapons and items\n\n- Fairly diverse assortment of missions\n\n- Great atmosphere - loved the area/map. Really invited you to go explore searching for great loot\n\n\nThe bad:\n\n- Melee combat system too simple\n\n- Poor A.I.\n\n- The survivors are literally chronically exhausted pansies with no adrenaline glands..  GRR!\n\n- Camera getting obstructed by bushes/trees\n\n- Anti-climatic ending.\n\n\nBugs/annoyances:\n\n- Zombies waist deep in.. FLOOR! You can't even melee them.\n\n- Zombies doing the running man against thigh high crates trying to reach you\n\n- Too few "one liners" - e.g. returning home with multiple rucksacks will often trigger the exact same ping-pong "dialouge" 4 times in close succession.\n\n- Cars getting relocated during cutscenes\n\n- Conversating characters during cutscenes not even remotely looking at eachother\n\n- Cars burning in the streets for weeks - energy crisis averted!\n\n-  Scavenger hunt progress increases while the "scavenger" is fighting outside\n\n\n..I could go on and on.\n\nAfter completing the last mission, I felt there were still so many things to try out, and achivements to accomplish. But at the same time I felt like waiting for a sequel which will hopefully have the refinement this game lacked, while retaining all the truly great things it did have.\n\n73%","August 23, 2014","true","18.8"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","5"

The graphic is mediocre (even for Xbox 360 standards), has sometimes odd graphic glitches, weird bugs (even after multiple patches), sometimes weird restrictions in gameplay (you cannot pass items to your companion) and a wonky AI.\n\nYet it was one of the most enjoyable games I played in recent years. It balances wonderfully multiple activity's like base management, companion management, resources gathering, missions, exploring the map and the zombie killing without laying a heavy emphasis on any of it. Contains a rich atmosphere and fitting music/ambience.\n\nState of Decay - Main Game (9/10)\nIt starts kinda slow, but after you leave the starting area heading to your first base it really gets interesting. Restarting the campaign multiple times trying something different.\n\nBreakDown - DLC (7/10)\nBasically the sandbox mode of main game without the story arc but with a few new playable characters and items. Has 10 levels which goes insanely hard with the last two levels, where you have pretty much no resources to work with, large strong zombie crowds and special infected everywhere.\n\nLifeLine - DLC (8/10)\nPlays near a infested city with a new story arc and characters. While it's not as big as it initially looks like (you cannot enter the city), it still has everything which made the main game fun, set in a new (even though smaller) environment.\n\nState of Decay is in my personal top 3 zombie games of all time with the very first Dead Rising and  Walking Dead Season 1.","June 5, 2014","true","101.5"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

I had watched a couple of people play the first 20 minutes or so when it first turned up. I am really, completely and utterly pleasantly surprised. I loved every minute of playing it.\n\nI'm a scaredy cat & I normally coward out of things after a short while. Not so with this. It's not really scary at all even for me (though the noises a couple of the special mobs make gives me the creeps).\n\nIt's certainly not a difficult game, and while I don't normally use that as a reason for critique it really could stand to be more difficult - though I know some people have said otherwise & I think that comes down to play-style. I lost one survivor but only because I was dumb and in a rush and switched survivors when I thought she was somewhere safe and she mysteriously died in that same spot. That's all. In amidst the pot luck of who will survive when you log back in it was my own lethargy that got her. You become strangely attached to a couple of the members of the group despite them being mostly ambiguous people - you really do feel that it's your responsibility to look after them.\n\nThe thing with this game is it is a persistent world. Think animal crossing - if you leave for too long things happen. I played it every day over the holidays logging off each time only once everyone was safe & sound and morale was full. I never returned to any nasty surprises other than a couple of enclaves getting over-run but - that's their own fault ;P If you can dedicate the hours in a short enough time frame it's not a deal-breaker but if you want to put it down and pick it up where you left off a couple of weeks later you might just find it burning around your feet. If you still have feet.\n\n\nUsing an X-box controller at least it was so smooth and satisfying to fight and running over zombies and hearing them pop when you run over them is just, satisfying. They don't really explain much to you but, I didn't find this off-putting but I did have to google what Fame & Influence really did.\nFor me it really could have stood to be a longer game - to have had the next area open up and be able to move up into a larger home base. But then I was lucky enough to have the time to maintain morale & resources. The OCD in me loves searching buildings & seeing the little X's appear on buildings once you've cleared them.\n\nAnd finally the story - it's nothing ground breaking or complex but just enough to make me feel a little sick. And for a game that's just a little sick, that's not too bad to me.","January 3, 2014","true","28.4"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","13"

You can also watch the video review here - http://youtu.be/mUuRTqf5j0s\n\nState of decay's core strengths lay within it's actual game play, it's clear early on in the game that undead labs wanted to ensure the game had a solid framework rather than just focusing on the cosmetic appeal of the genre. At its core state of decay is a survival game. I'll talk more about the games story later in the video but needless to say, you start the game and find yourself in the middle of a most unpleasant of zombie apocalypses.\n\nStealth is key to survival in state of decay, and the game provides a variety of mechanics for you to utilize to make sure you don't find yourself surrounded by the undead hordes. Your bog standard zombie in SOD isn't the sharpest tool in the shed, their eyesight is very poor, out of sight really is out of mind in the game. The enemies do have an acute sense of hearing however, the game visually feedbacks how much noise your making, whether your searching through cupboards or breaking down locked doors, best to be as quiet as possible or you will literally have the unwashed masses at your front door in no time. Throughout the game it is often easier to kill the standard zombie by stealth kills or building yourself so very fine traps. Though noise is your worst enemy it can be your greatest ally, creating distractions with a variety of tools, can be a great way of getting out of a particularly sticky situation.\n\nOne of the great things about state of decay is that its not just you versus the world. There are a lot of survivors out there and you'll eventually get to become part of a survivor community. Your community has its own base and number of people and these too things require attention. Lets start with bases, there are a number of locations in the game world that can be used as a base. You can only have one base at a time. Each base location varies in size and that’s important because as your community grows so too will the need for beds and space. Bases can be upgraded in a variety of ways, from self sustaining food gardens to guard towers, choosing what you need is crucial as space is limited. Upgrading your defences and keeping your base well stocked and guarded is important too, bases will get attacked frequently, they can be overrun and people can and will die.\n\nThe survivors at your base also will need attention too. They need food, medical supplies and ammunition. Each survivor in your community has needs and desires, you wont please everyone, but its somewhat beneficial to at least try. Each survivor has an affection rating towards you, once you become friends with a survivor, that character becomes a player character meaning you can switch between characters at any time, especially useful when one becomes too fatigued to be any good in the field. The survivors in your community can be used to go out on computer controlled scavenging runs as well as used as companions to take out with you. Survivors have their own stories and ongoing lives, occasionally they will ask you to do something for them, whether it be deal with a zombie or a more side quest esc personal mission. Doing these side quests for your survivors improves your relationship with them and this is the way you will eventually be able to control them yourself.\n\nOther survivor communities populate the landscape too, you can interact with these in a variety of ways from doing missions for them to trading. Trading in state of decay works off an influence system, every-time you do missions, kill zombies etc etc your earn influence points, these influence points can then be used to purchase ammo, weapons and supplies from the survivor communities. You also need influence points to upgrade your base structures as well as a variety of scavenged resources. Sometimes you may even have the option to add some survivor communities to your own, but beware things might get a bit cramped if you don’t have the space and NPC's can have fall outs with each other, the walking dead style.\n\nOne thing I really like about the game is in its RPG elements, each player character has four base skills, Cardio, wits, fighting and shooting. On top of that each individual character has a set of personal skills and traits. Take the fighting skill, this skill covers melee fighting and overall hit points. By using melee weapons on a character a lot of the time this skill will start to increase and unlock more stat bonuses. By doing certain actions a lot with a certain character this may also unlock personal traits, that add traits to that individual too, for example if you have a character that you use to scavenge a lot, you may develop a personal trait that adds a reduction to the time it takes to scavenge.\n\nThe game world itself is pretty extensive for a smaller title, you have around 8 square kilometres of playable area to go explore at your will. The world ranges from very American mid west countryside to more urbanised areas. The game also features dynamic progression, meaning even when your not playing, the world is still changing, after all just because your sleeping doesn't mean those zombies are. Its important to leave your bases well stocked before you leave the game or you may load up to an abandoned base with a lot of bodies.\n\nThere's a good enemy variety in the game to boot, not all zombies are brain dead walkers. There are a number of special zombies which are more of a challenge to take down. In some cases when facing specials it can be better to run to live to fight another day, especially if your low an ammo, especially if your facing the hulk esc beasts known as juggernauts. An interesting mechanic for the enemies in the game is the horde mechanic, if several average zombies converge on one area, they will start to attract others and a horde will form. These hordes can be very dangerous and are not to be taken on directly, its best to ensure the zombies around your base are as scattered as possible, keep that population down.\n\nGraphically while a eye pleasing game in most respects, state of decay does suffer from FPS drops, terrain clipping but even with some cosmetic issues it never loses that immersive feel, and because the core gameplay is so good, you actually end up forgiving its short comings. The game does a great job in the sound department, cracking zombie heads with baseball bats sounds as grim as you would expect it too, its certainly not lacking in aesthetic.\n\nNow lets talk story. The game starts you off as Marcus and your friend Ed coming back from a fishing trip in the mountain lakes, once you get back you quickly realize that all those 1980's horror movies have come true and your set off on your journey to find out what exactly is going on and how to get the hell out of there. While I don't want to spoil the games story there are some interesting plot mechanics that I do want to mention, specifically that certain story events can be missed if you ignore them too long. Spend too long wandering the world looking for supplies and some events can be missed and things will change. Not only this but certain story events can change the world around making survival increasingly difficult for you and your new found family.\n\nEven more recently the new downloadable content Breakdown has been released. Breakdown is a true sandbox mode, stripping the game of its main story allowing you to embark on a seemingly never ending quest for survival.\n\nIn all Undead labs have succeeded in creating of the most enjoyable zombie survival games of recent years. The mix of solid mechanics, engaging characters and open world survival is a breath of fresh air in a genre where we seem to get a boat ton of below par games thrown at us non stop. State of decay is a must for any zombie survival fan and while its by no means perfect, you will get value for money.","January 5, 2014","true","2.0"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","14","20","0","0"

Your little group of 3 then make your way back to the ranger station only to find everyone there has also been killed.

Now you are going to do a lot of running in this game, a lot of button mashing fighting and you are going to get very upset at yourself for making stupid mistakes that get you killed, because if you die then you’re dead.

Remember you are not super human.\n\nThe game is not very hard but at the same time it's not very easy either at first you run up to every zombie you can find to beat up to see all the different cool moves your character has to take down zombies but as you progress you learn one very important thing, being overrun is dangerous, too many zombies in a small space could be fatal and so you find yourself avoiding contact later in the game.\n\nSo what makes the game great? Well here's a list of why I think it's a great game.\n1. The story progresses if and when you want it to, though there are plenty missions available you don't have to do them all.\n2. If you scavenge supplies and you find more than you can carry you can call in for help. Leave the premises and a friend or two will go get the remainder of the supplies.\n3. Relocating your home base, as your circle grows you need more space, and different home bases give different "Rewards"\n4. The Zombies are balanced out, it’s not like most other games where there are little or no zombies, or they are massively over populated and you have almost no chance of survival.\n5. The vehicle damage is very realistic, you hit a fence or a couple of zombies a few times and you are going to start getting radiator problems.\n\nBut there are also a few bad things in the game.\n1. You find yourself doing the same thing over and over again a lot in the game.\n2. The game has no manual save option, which makes it more realistic ( I actually like this ) but it's bad for when you make a stupid mistake and end up dead then you sit there afterwards and think why the hell did I do that.\n3. This is probably what bugs me the most, the whole time you are playing the game it feels like you are sitting behind a console, and I am a very big console Hater and I am not afraid to say it. The game feels like a cheap console port to PC and it's close to unplayable with a keyboard and mouse, if you want to enjoy the game you will need a controller.\n4. The gun mechanics doesn't work too well, due to the fact that the game is third person you often find yourself shooting at strange angles which in reality would be impossible to hit the target but in the game it works.\n\nThis is by far one of my longest reviews ever, but a lot of words to describe a good game.\n\nMy Rating - 8/10 - The Console port to PC is a big disappointment and makes the game difficult to play on a keyboard and mouse.\n\nSeriously a great game. Buy it...\n\n_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_\nBreakdown DLC Review\n\nI played through State of Decay and really enjoyed the game but I did however find the game very short and was a little disappointed when I finished it was almost as if the game just got good and then it was finished. But a little while after I finished I saw that Breakdown was available and I must say If you love State of Decay as much as I do then this DLC is just for you. This DLC basically takes the game as we know and remove the whole story mode and turns it into a full on sandbox mode, your only goal is to survive and eventually when you want fix an old RV randomly located on the map and hop out of town with 5 of your best mates. Once you do that you start from scratch again, less loot, more zombies and stronger zombies. The map gets randomized but the idea stays the same SURVIVE!\n\nA lot of people complain saying this DLC wasn't added content but just removed content but I say good work, now the game can be enjoyed for much longer. I will definitely recommend this DLC. It also adds a few new achievements for achievement hunters as State of Decay is one of the very easy games to complete all the achievements but these however aren't as easy as the base game.\n\nGet it - Enjoy it - Rate it\n\nMy Rating 9/10\nOnly bad thing in breakdown is that there are too many side missions going on at the same time, almost impossible to do them all and keep everyone happy and progress in the game. I find myself almost helping a stranger in trouble every 5 to 10 minutes.","January 28, 2014","true","70.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","1"

I'm honestly 50-50 on this game, but what really caused me to choose to not recommend this game was the major cliff hanger at the end and being shocked at how short this game is and how much time I pretty much wasted on doing side missions not knowing which missions were progressive ones, so I spent probably 10 hours out of the 18 for doing almost pointless stuff.\n\nThis game was fun, I enjoyed the side missions for the first 3 times they generated, and gathering supplies to progress in this game, but this game could have had more realism and more stuff to do. I don't suggest expecting lots out of this game and instead I suggest trying out DayZ (standalone&mod version). It's more realistic and you basically create your own adventure and story line if you are into making it seem like that.\n\nI'd give this game a 5/10.\n","September 17, 2015","false","18.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Very fun and Enjoyable. Personally, i'd give it a 8/10 but if it wanted a 10/10. What i'd suggest is..\n\n- Since there are already a few main characters you meet at the start of the game you could tell an in-depth story for each character like in GTA 5 you can switch characters and play through different characters story and learn more about them, also some good cut scenes would be quite great, perhaps with some conflict between two or more characters or even other groups.\n\n- New Expansion in the near future with a map extention, new weapons, cars, homes that go up to like 50-100 people to manage, go out in groups of 5-10 to do super dangerous missions, everything in big scale too :P\n\nLast but not least If this game was Online, Multiplayer, Co-op would be super awesome, simply cause playing with friends makes games even more enjoyable.\n\nAnyway those are my Pros, Cons and Suggestions. I Love this game and I recommend giving state of decay a shot if you enjoy games in this genre, Thanks for reading.\n\n- Chrono","December 4, 2013","true","22.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","5"

Enjoy the skull smashing and decapitation, and don't worry about those red smudges on your clothes, it's perfectly normal in here!\n\nState of Decay, an arcade-ish zombie "sandbox" game by Undead Labs. "Sandbox" because you have the possibility to do what you want (in game limitations of course), without any time limits.\nThere is a story, but it's not what you should buy this game for. It's the fun from killing zombies, and building a community to survive.\n"Building a community"? Yes. You have it in here. You start out small, with some people barely tying up an end with the other end, and you are supposed to help them survive. Or you can just ignore them completely and go kill some zombies. Up to you.\n\nThe combat is pretty enjoyable. The game doesn't have any tutorials on to how to kill that walking corpse, but you will figure it out fairly quickly. Or just check the wiki. There are few types of zombies, from the normal shambling ones, through sprinting ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and ending with a juggernaut that requires some effort to take out.\n\nGameplay itself is also done well. You can get into nearly every building you see, you can look around for supplies to help your group survive, you can swap between characters. And there's character progression.\nMany people recommend playing on a pad, but I actually have no difficulties to play on a keyboard & mouse.\n\nGraphics are nice, even for a X360 game, made on CryEngine 3. AI is good enough (as for a zombie).\n\nIf you are looking for a game where you kill zombies, run around and do stuff, and where it "tries" to simulate an apocalypse, then this is it.\n\nI got this for full price, and I am not disappointed. There's a living modding community going, so the game has at least some years of life more. Although, if you do not care about a story mode, and you prefer just a survival sandbox, you should also get Breakdown DLC.","February 2, 2014","true","98.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","2"

I watched probably the first 1 min of the game and decided not to try it out.\n\nLater on , it was on sale and I tried it out.\n\nIt is addicting. Seriously.\n\nI wanted a zombie game where you can move around and scavenge. Surviving with other people is excellent, too.\n\nI will state the problems I had until now:\n\n1. No online. Multiplayer, co-op, whatever. It would be better if I DIDNT HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING IN THIS GAME. Also, there aren't a lot of places to go after you explored everything.\n\n2. Game can be frustrating when you have to babysit everyone. Like seriously, every day one person is sad, or angry and I have to take them for a walk like a child. Seriously. Take it out. Or make it rare. I'm getting sick and tired of that.\n\n3. More DLCs and maps would be great. Seriously, this game needs to be continued. It is incredibly immersive and it should have more content added.\n\n4. Let us manually save. I don't want to continue with dead survivors.\n\n5. Two reasons why the survivors died:\n\nA) Ever paused a game and alt-tabbed to quickly chat with someone or look something up? Well, doing that about 65% of the time, the game CONTINUES BY ITSELF. I died 2-3 time because of that. It is so stupid.\n\nB) Saving a downed survivor.....is hard. I managed to save one....but she blew up....literarily....Why? No idea.\n\n\nOther than that, I love the game. Cars and special zombies are excellent.\n\nAnyone who is a fan of zombie games and open world gameplay will absolutely love this game. I wish the developers will release more content which I will buy instantly.\n\nI am currently playing this till i feel like not playing it until DLCs come out. Which is usually over 50 hours. :)\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who is considering to get it. Hope they update it more in the future.\n\nThank you. :)\n\nBtw, Just read the topic in the forum addressing the multiplayer. I can see why there will not be a multiplayer.

Then you should absolutely check out State Of Decay.\n\nI enjoyed this game a lot. Searching for supplies never gets old and I think that is because the loot varies, from basic food supplies (coffee, snacks, ect) to medicine or ammo, melee weapons of all sorts and guns. Who doesn't love finding a stash of ammo for that one favourite gun of yours? Searching for supplies feels natural in this game. And it really adds to the survival element.\n\nState Of Decay is slow paced compared to a lot of other zombie games and a lot of the time you'll have to take your time to really assess your group of survivors and the base as even when you're not playing, the game itself is still active. I left off with good morale within the group and came back the next day to find one of the survivors had fallen sick and another had died. So the game really keeps you on your toes and is constantly changing.\n\nIn the game you'll be able to complete a lot of missions, you'll pretty much always have something to do however if you ignore missions for long enough or simply get occupied doing other things within the game certain missions will solve themselves, not always in a good way either. Fail to help a fellow survivor kill a certain zombie, or find a lost survivor and they might die doing the mission on their own. So the game really encourages you to constantly be active. However this doesn't happen for every mission so if you prefer just exploring and doing supply runs, then do your thing.\n\nThe game is far from perfect and there is honestly a few things that could have been polished further, the driving mechanics feel clunky and occasionally the AI will do a few silly things. However playing the game I found myself looking past those things and instead simply enjoying the world and gameplay and of course fretting over my survivors. Stop getting sick ya'll!!!\n\nWould recommend!\n\n\n\n\n\n","June 28, 2015","true","22.8"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

It's utterly broken. Not only that, but some of the game mechanisms have been adjusted to be downright ridiculous. Original State of Decay was filled with bugs, but I've managed to get to it when most of that was apparently fixed. Unfortunately, as it seems, developers learned nothing and same thing happened here.\n\n- Game hands down cheats. Zombie respawn is ridiculous - you clean a room, then you turn your back and few seconds later they're back. I think they've wanted to make this DLC more difficult, but there are better ways to do it without making the player feel cheated.\n- Also, when you make your game harder, make sure you'll also adjust survavability of the friendly AI. They were equally dumb in original, but there weren't many situations where AI gets surrounded by 10 zombies. AI doesn't know the term running away, they're mindless drones. I've lost several NPCs just because all they understand is to attack and when they get overrun, there is nothing you can do.\n- In fact, NPCs have problems doing even the simpliest things, like running through doors or getting in cars.\n- Car physics, if you can even call it that, makes them very easy to flip over, because we're apparently on moon. Two times I've been launched in the air with my car without doing anything else than getting close to some object (pathway, building).\n- Due to map design, lots of it happens in quite close quarters and corridors, which makes it excellent for your character to get stuck in group of zombies without any chance to get out. You can just watch your character glitch through them as you desperately mash buttons to no awail.\n- Reloading weapons sometimes doesn't work and works only when you zoom in.\n- When I say this ♥♥♥♥ is utterly broken, I mean it. When siege happens, if you're in middle of saving someone, you magically can't talk to them, which forces you to leave them and come for them again, if they manage to survive. I don't know how long have they tested this DLC, but there are huge issues that anyone has to run into after few minutes of playing...\n- Last but not least, you would think that soldiers will be a little more competent with firearms than civilians, but no, your teamates can't shoot for their life, and they're more than happy to let their fellow soldiers to die and continue shooting like it's 4th July.\n\nThe home defence system just doesn't outweight so many problems this DLC has, and it's not so fun as it might seem at first, because sieges usually happen when you least need it. Overall, this piece of rotten meat has brough me a lot of frustration.. Avoid it like a plague it is, play original game. I have lost a lot of hope that Undead Labs will release something playable in future, if this is supposed to be their standard now.","June 22, 2014","false","23.0"," 20 of 32 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","20","32","0","0"

Be warned:  the beginning is a little slow and underwhelming but once you get into it, it can be quite addicting.\n\nI haven't encountered any significant glitches during my playtime, but I have heard about some.

I love the idea of an open world game where you don't just have to survive, but you also have to build a community and make choices that make a difference in the end. And the game does an OK job of that, but it throughs these tiny wrenches that mess everything up and ruin the game.\n\nPros:\n+High stakes- it saves just about everytime you do anything, so if you ♥♥♥♥ up, then you ♥♥♥♥ed up.\n+It gives personality to some of the characters, making them more enjoyable to play as\n+ You can play as any survivor you save ( I don't know, I think this is a really cool game mechanic)\n\nCons:\n+ like i said before, when you mess up there's no going back, and that creates tenssio, which is awesome.... until you die as your favorite character. Some of the characters have dialog that is so much better than others and when they die, it's frustrating.\n+ The controls are often unresponsive, especially when you go from interacting with something to moving\n+The most fun I had in this game had to be when I was running over zombies with a car, zombies fling left and right is just so satisfying. But after you hit around 20 zombies ( which will take you around 30 seconds to do) your car engine starts to smoke and if you kit more zombies, the engine catches on fire and the car explodes\n+The graphics arn't that good and when you turn your camera in any direction, this wierd bluring affect happens and it just makes the game annoying to look at\n\nI get that some that they're trying to make this game intense, where when your survivors die, the die for good and you have to live with that, and some people might love that ( I this is you, then you might want to get this game). But it's just frustrating to me. If I die as a character, chances are that it's my favorite character since i like to play as that character. It's annoying how I might get so far through a playthrough and then some bs happens and I die.\n\nLike I said I love the idea of a game like this, but it does so many tiny annoying things where I'v just gotten tired of plying it. I would much rather have a fun game where I can ♥♥♥♥ around, than a game where 1 ♥♥♥♥ up means inevitable death.\n\nTL;DR: If you like games like h1z1 or the farcry series, then I would just wait till a sale.\n","May 6","false","41.0"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

Your objective in the game is to survive. You need to gather supplies, make sure your home is safe and that there is always enough food, ammo and madicine. You start the game as a regular character who finds a house with his friends, and make your way to the top until you are pretty much in charge of the house. Once you have enough influence you can make big decitions, such as moving to a diffrent place and such.\n\nWhile this is good, the game has one big problem. The characters in the game are very boring and dont really tell a story. You can't really communicate with them, but only with basic commends like "Hi, come and follow me" and such. The game does a good job at keeping you busy and giving you new missions all the time.\n\nIn overall, State of Decay is a very good game, that could have been even better, which I see as a very big miss. I give the game 8.5/10, and with deeper characters and a better storyline, I think it'd deserve a 10/10. Big miss, but still a good game.","May 7, 2014","true","45.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Bad thing is zombies spawn way to quick, you can clear a street and walk in a house and a zombie is looking in the window back at you.\nThe real kicker is the missions come fast. You have to figure out what is important to you. They time out after a while to, and whatever happens happens, and you have to deal with it.  You can take a little while to decide, but again, they do expire.\nOverall a good fun to play Zombie setting, with some good replay ability, you will always start at the same place, but you can choose differnt things after the starting round and find differnt people and things to get into.\n\nEDIT: Also recommend Breakdown, the DLC. It adds long time playability to the game. Gives you the chance to unlock and play heroes and changing difficulties.\nAs far as Lifeline, its OK. A good time to play once, but it didnt hold my interest beyond that.","June 1, 2014","true","298.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I shelved it after a full play through. I came back after some time to find it unsupported and a discussion thread from the developer asking us to buy the game again as a newly remastered one year edition. How about a free upgrade since I already gave you money? I could understand if the game was no longer supported because it was a decade old, but it was only 1 FRICKING YEAR OLD and now unsupported.\n\nThe current state of the game is BROKEN and will not run properly with NVidia drivers. You literally have to disable your Nvidia card in your device manager and run the Intel card. There is not a patch or support.\n\nJust an FYI, Undead Labs has done a great job deflecting this whole debacle by blaming Microsoft Studios saying it was a contact obligation so the new Year One Survial Edition could be playable on XBox 1. However, a little research will show that aside from the DLC and YOSE, all of their games are unsupported and no longer sold, some less than a year old. PURE CASH GRAB!\n\nAVOID UNDEAD LABS.

The most annoying bug that i encountered so far is when a zombie noclipping through the wall and when sometimes when you press up, your character when the opposite way, that is really frustrating when you try to help your follower from getting killed by a zombie.\nBut, i still give it a thumbs up. Why ?? Because this game gave me some really unique experience that i can't get from any other games. It gave me absolute freedom in a world full of zombies, and many of the game mechanic really give me the impression that you are not a superhero, you are just a group of people that trying to survive this harsh world full with zombie, and you spend your day trying to find supplies in some of the abandoned building for your group so they can survive for another day. One of the game mechanic that i really like is the permadeath, When the character you controlled or other character in your community died, they died for good. No respawn, just death.\nSoo far, this game is really great. Buggy, but great. Do you ever wander what is like to surviving in the world full of zombie and still have fun ? Then, this is a truly awesome game for you ! It prove that what makes games good is not the graphic or how polished is the game, but how fun is the gameplay.

Plus there is RPG like advancement of your main character and the other 'party' members you recruit along the way as each has a variety of skills and each skill advances as it's used unlocking further skills and special attacks/abilities.  It also has a very nice open world which rewards exploration as pretty much any location you find out of the way will have some nice loot to scavenge (better weapons, backpacks, etc.).  You also build yourself a base/community and have to manage various resources and personalities.  Helping out strangers opens up trade options and if you help them enough they'll be friendly and ask to join your community, but it's still up to you whether you want to add them and support them through play or no.  There are also more things to do than you can possibly get done timewise so you have to choose who to help and what to put priority on; but I've found gives me that sense of just one more thing and then I'll quit... awww just one more...\nIf you like the game then the Breakdown DLC adds a new game type where instead of following the story of the main campaign you have a minor story just the framework of survival for the world but gives RPG like goals in accomplishing certain things like using certain weapon types, or other accomplishments which unlock hero characters you can recruit where they don't start with minimal skills but instead have special items and upgraded skills.\n\nThe one complaint I have is that it's very hard to maintain a clear zombie free area.  Seems like more often than not you only get a few steps away from a building you've cleared and zombies are right back into since the zombies seem to mostly spawn right around where your current character is, and I wish I could just lock some of my party/community members in our home so they'd stop going off on their own and getting in trouble within minutes of my rescuing them from one thing they are back out looking for trouble again.  Also for some missions which have a limited time to respond it would be nice to know what those timeframes are or see some color scheme like green, yellow, red so that you'd better know which ones need to be prioritized without having to keep track of when they showed up relative to the other available missions.","March 6, 2014","true","108.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

There are several very nice mods available on their forums as well. If the game is too easy for you then you can make it more difficult, if it is too hard you can make it easier. I personally didn't like how you could just mow down everything with vehicles so I got a mod that makes vehicles more fagile. You are able to switch characters and get them higher in their skills of fighting, running, searching, etc. If you want to play the more sneaking around and avoiding zombies then you can very easily do that. It just really allows you to play the game the way you want to play it without locking you into one way of doing this.

Would I recommend State of Decay for full-price? No, but I would for a more reasonable one. Initially I had a great time with this game, but after a few hours hours its repetative nature is painfully obvious. You have everything down, the side-quests go in a circle, while you wait for the main-quest to advance. The looping AI voices become an annoyance. Unlike what the description said, you cannot decide what way the story goes. I still managed to sink quite a bit more hours into this because I enjoyed driving around and being in the world but the game kept trying to pull me back into the framework, and I tried a second time to see if I could change anything, but it was the same deal.

The ideas are good but the execution is abysmal.  Potentially heavy moments are ruined by clunky programming that suck you right out of the moment.  When one of the survivors who have been with you from the beginning start to get sick and you have to take them to an isolated area to euthanize them, the stage is set for a gaming moment you'll remember for years.\n\nHowever, when you shoot that person, loot their corpse, and radio back home that you're bringing loot (really, that's the part you want to announce to your group?) and the reponse is, "Get anything good?"  the moment is so ruined it's hard to forgive the game, particularly when this is how every moment in the game goes.  Nothing has any weight.  Do a Google search for a Would You Rather game because it's essentially the same thing.\n\nTell someone in your current group that you looted her father's corpse, led her to believe her father might still be alive, and used the group's resources in the meantime.  Uh oh, she found out?  Time for a big conversation....or she'll just say she thought something might be wrong with her father, thank you calmly, and walk away.\n\nIt's baffling to me that the creators of the game went through the trouble of setting up some interesting moments in the game and decided on zero follow through.  The combat is very much a stiff and awkward button-basher and the RPG elements play a minor role.   Every mission and every action feels weightless.  I'm leaving the game unfinished because there's just no substance here and I am truly disappointed in that.","February 4","false","25.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

Each character has their own inventory and stats and traits that may help your community. For example, some survivors might of been a vet or doctor before the outbreak and can use the communities medical supplies more efficiently.\n\nYour community is a collection of survivors who have banded together and found a defendable home to live in, you can upgrade your home base using resources you scavenge in the world and find new survivors to recruit into your community as well as help other established communities and organize resource trades with them.\n\nThe game is entirely single player but the developers have tried to give the game a more dynamic feel by making events happen in your game while you’re not playing it. I’m not too sure how I feel about this, it does make things more interesting but I don’t like having that lack of control in a single player game.\n\nLily, your communities’ radio girl, will advise you about current events and distress signals that are happening in the world. These may include; nearby hordes that need to be wiped out, a survivor in trouble, a community member that needs help with a task, a sighting of an infestation that needs to be dealt with or even a friend at home base that needs help with their depression or anger issues.\n\nWhile not completing tasks and story missions you will usually find yourself exploring and looking for resources to take back home. Food tends to disappear the quickest, especially when you have a large home population, so building a garden at home or finding a reliable source of food and building an outpost there is a must.\n\nCharacters can also specialize in certain fields such as blunt weapons, edged weapons or rifles, etc. Some characters will naturally be better at certain weapons or abilities depending on their traits… the main character I used was an alcoholic and she could not increase her ‘Wits’ stats at all because of that.\n\nCars are also a big part of the game, after a while of gameplay you will notice that you eventually run out of cars if you don’t start returning them to your home base after you use them. Vehicles can be an amazing zombie killing tool but can get damaged easily after running down a few hordes, so it’s always good to build a proper workshop at home and have a mechanic to repair the good cars you find.\n\nWhen your community gets too large you will tend to have more problems with survivors not getting along with each other and various mental problems some survivors are having, offenders can be evicted if you don’t feel like having to deal with them and sick or dying people can even be mercy killed before they turn. Finding a bigger and better home is always something that should be on the smart survivalist’s mind when exploring.\n\nThe currency of the game is influence and can be spent at community homes to buy items out of their supply locker as well as support while outside of home such as artillery strikes and car delivery. A community with well built facilities will tend to produce more items in their supply locker each day.\n\nWhen your character dies, you will have to play another character back at home whom you have made friends with – if you have no other player characters you respawn as a new recruit to the community with a few starting items.\n\nMy biggest issue with the game would have to be the graphics. It’s not the overall quality that annoys me, but in certain locations with certain lightning I find it very hard to see which was really off-putting for me. I also had quite a few bugs that made my game’s story behave very weird, luckily I was still able to finish it.\n\nThe game also has a DLC called ‘Breakdown’ which adds a never-ending gamemode that allows the player a bit more freedom than in the original game, however it should be played after you have finished the main story.\n\nI enjoyed the originality of State of Decay, I felt like I really got attached to the characters I found in the game as well as my own which is rare for a sandbox-type game and I enjoyed being able to play with a community/home management system while also getting to play in an immersive third person action RPG. Unfortunately the graphics were bad enough to make me feel ill at times.","March 26, 2014","true","19.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

That is , because there's a character progression. You character evolves, will level his fighting if you fight alot of zombies or other traits... Also, there's a community which is actually where the whole game is based.\n\nFor example, when you're searching for supplies in a house , you can choose to radio home for them back at camp to come there and take the items you selected IF you don't have room for more into your inventory. Also, When you find survivors and save them , they join your camp and grow stronger as a defense to the zombie apocalypse.\n\nIn the beggining of the game , you're given a piece of wood and your kicking as your sole defense. Although it's enough for you to not die. You can choose to go out with 1 other person to help you.\n\nThe noise mechanics are adequate. I would not expect anything less-more since it's good. Using cars is not safe because if you rev high, the zombies ( Zeds as they are called in SoD ) will hear it and come after you.\n\nCars have a storage. You can store up to 5 or 6 items into it's trunk which is really useful.Also, you can hit zeds with your door.\n\nThere can be different types of zeds except your normal-like zombies.\n\nBleeehhh . ( zombie growl? )\n\nThere are 2 dlc's for this game. HAve NOT bought them yet.\n\nThe only major error i find is the color of the game. What i mean , is that the saturation is wrong. I dont know if its me , but... it either looks bright and strange or dark and shadow-y . It can be overlooked .\n\n","June 5, 2014","true","9.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","4"

"State of Decay" is one of the rare gems out there which seems to be made by intelligent, thinking gaming enthusiasts for gamers. It's not one of those highly polished productions you play but quickly forget afterwards, but one of the games which will keep you smiling because you just found another great detail you've been longing to see because it simply made sense to put it into such a game.\n\nSate of Decay doesn't bore you with dumb "game mechanics", applied because some marketing director wanted it so. No, it delivers you an open world designed with sticking to common sense. Furthermore, the designers weren't shy to incorporate features known from gaming classics like Jagged Alliance i.e.:\n\nEvery survivor you find will have some unique character traits, which will make her or him someone worth liking - or loathing. You'll quickly single out your favorite protagonists, screaming in dismay when you are ambushed by a juggernaut zombie while you are trying to run the heavy backpack home.\n\nAnother detail which reminded me of Jagged Alliance is the myriad of different weapons and ammunitions you'll find. From a trusty .375 revolver to a AKMS submachine gun - you'll enjoy outfitting your favorite guy with the best gun available.\n\nThe story focuses on the way people are trying to deal with the situation - including a powermongering, aims-justify-the-needs judge going slowly rogue. With people somewhere between despertion and hope the story makes the whole setting way more believable than you'd expect. It allows you to blend in, to feel the immersion a good game has to create to make it on my list of games...\n\n\nworth playing!\n\n\nThe few cons I experienced are mainly of cosmetic value:\n\nThe controls are a bit difficult to get into and the lack of a real manual is leaving you to guesswork. Especially moving your home confused me: Yes, you need to do a few story missions before you are allowed to move it. Good to know, better if the game would have explained it further on.\n\n\nAt some point of the game you are spammed by a multitude of very, very similar missions: Rescue a survivor, kill a special zombie, clean out an infestation, etc. It can be annoying, but only because you are feverish about accomplishing the next "home improvement" and thus having no time to rescue the next jaywalking zombie apocalypse survivor.\n\nA few minor bugs are still in the game: Zombie getting stuck in porches, zombies banging their head against thin air, instead of the wall behind them, survivors running against an obstacle instead of going around. Luckily all these are not frequent and  / or easily solvable by giving  a gentle push.","December 3, 2013","true","96.1"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

You know, Dark Souls 2 did this and I guess these devs thought they could, too, except without putting any additional effort into remixing content, giving any discounts to owners of the original, or really any technical changes whatsoever.\n\nAt least that's how it started.  By this point there have been some significant updates and patches to the new YOSE version.  Users that supported the original title and its continued development by purchasing DLC were apparently shafted, when the devs not only DIDN'T use that money for anything to fix the game, but they dumped it all into some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Free-to-Play puzzle game that has, by now, been completely shut down and failed as well as a graphical overhaul for an older game without any justification for purchase to those that have already completed the original.\n\nSo now what?  What's next for Undead Labs, with their last two releases performing so miserably?  Their dev blog has been completely unrelated to game development for the past 9 months.  Probably nothing worth caring about, much like this game, which you can no longer buy and the DLC costs as much as the new game when it's on sale and doesn't support the game at all.  Who, in their right mind, could recommend a title you can even purchase?\n\nBut let's extend this review to the company itself.  It has a track record of one really successful title that isn't sold anymore, an incredibly unsuccessful re-release of that same game, and a dead game.  What this only leads players to expect is either a game that isn't fun that they can't even play after some number of months or an actually good game that gets completely re-sold like a new product some time later with actual dev support behind it only the second time around.  Undead Labs is unreliable, skeevy, and unethical at best.  Watch from afar but don't touch.","April 7","false","27.2"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

A minor complaint that also conveniently hides some of the uglier graphics.\n\nThe sounds get the job done, it's all bit minimal if you ask me, and the voice acting has plenty of variety and is all told in a convincing manner.\n\nUnfortunately I wasn't able to progress through the story because of a game breaking bug that stopped me from getting new story missions later on.

[spoiler free]\n\nOnce upon a time, in a forest far far away. There were two redshirts, who magically plopped into a campsite with no reason to be there.\nGeneric redshirt one was very good at leadership!\nGeneric redshirt two was very good at...well...nothing.\n\nGeneric redshirt one and two both stumbled upon a small campsite, however the campsite had been designed and developed by the Call of Duty school of object interaction. And therefore redshirt one could only take items from BRIGHT AND PULSING ILLUMINATED PILES OR OBJECTS, redshirt one and two blissfully walked past the obvious packets of food around the barbecue as well as the backpacks laying around.\n\nLater they stumbled upon a park ranger station where they met many other redshirts, all who were as clueless and redshirted as them. They were then guided to a gunshot in the distance, where they recruited redshirt three. They all joyfully hopped back to the ranger station and found their fellow redshirts had lived up to their names and died.\n\nThey all decided to leave on a suspiciously empty road that covered a good quarter of the map. Entering an American sedan with wood exterior. There was enough of them to turn on the radio to "what is love" and nod their heads in unison. But they didn't.\n\nAfter a while Redshirt one, two and three found another group, full of more redshirts. They were all sent on varying missions, taking it in turns to go out into the towns nearby and eventually as their kill count increased they began to become less redshirt-ish.\n\nI finally had a Picard, a Data and a Seven-of-nine.*\n\n*The rest I never bothered with, my 3 main character choices were enough to keep me going for the whole game\nThe rest of the group just sat about, complaining and taking resources while each of my characters in turn broke their backs bringing back mountains of supplies in their trucks each run.\n\nAside from each character starting out a redshirt, there is no customization. So you are dumped with what are basically blank slates with a smiley face drawn on. Hell, where can I make my own face with a smiley face on?\n\nMaybe I would become more attached to my character and actually care if they got seriously wounded or sick?\n\nSoon after my band of redshirts moved to a bigger location, where was like the old location but I kept getting harassed to move by a fellow redshirt**\n\n**State of Decay tries to make this atmosphere of "you are doomed, panic!". But it never fully achieves this. One example was when my group had one day of food left, everyone was panicking and harassing me about it. I casually walked across the street, found a rucksack of food from a store and walked back...\nCrisis averted in less than 2 hours in game, about 30 minutes in real time.\n\nSpeaking of which, the majority of work you do in this game is simply busywork. It is "go here" "help this guy" "look here" etc. If you don't pull time out of the important stuff you are doing and go help this one guy in a group you never talk to then they will be angry when they return.\n\nI had to refuse a quest from a fellow redshirt because I was too busy to follow up on hunting a mutated zombie, since I was more concerned about starving to death. Naturally did the logical thing and decided we were no longer friends, simply telling me to "get lost" every time I went near them.***\n\n***It is a lose-lose scenario where you grip and control slowly slips away and you can't do anything to stop it. It quickly becomes frustrating.\n\nEventually all my redshirts survived, with only a few scripted deaths along the way\nHooray and such\n\nConclusionIn essence State of Decay isn't a game I would call "bad" or "poor", but more "rough". It has plenty of problems such as the logic behind the world it shows you. One NPC was talking about rioting in the streets and looting, yet in this town I could only count 4 looted buildings out of around 50. Many of them were untouched.\n\nGreat attention to detail has been made for this game, if you are sprinting towards a window and press the action button "E", you will throw yourself out of the window to safety. Also the scavenging system is quite unique because you can "rush" a scavenge and make more noise, or maybe create a lot of noise that will draw zombies from everywhere to your location, a good risk-reward system in my opinion.\n\nThere is no casual dialogue with anyone unless they have a mission, which combined with the lack of character customization makes the game quite shallow.\nHowever characters do comment on things such as zombies flanking you or meeting some NPCS.\n\nThe skills are done D&D style. The more you use them, the better they get.\nAfter a while you can pick additional perks to enhance your combat ability. However many of these special moves require the use of the left shift/left control + another key, which you can imagine is very difficult on a keyboard. I strongly advise using a controller.\n\nAs I said. Rough. But not bad.

I really wanted to enjoy this game. But after hours of playing it, I just can't.\n\nWhen it was announced, I was really hyped up and wanted to play it so bad. But once it got released and then I played it for hours, I was filled with nothing but boredom and disappointment.\n\nI'll start with the positives since good reviewers should always start with the good and then the bad. There's a lot of fun to be had here. The intense feeling of being chased by zombie hordes, finding supplies to keep yourself alive and fighting zombies. All whilst leveling yourself up so you can take on the hardest of things.\n\nNot only that, but there's quests that you get to do as well and some of these quests can repeat themselves too. So you're never short on never having anything to do except just running around.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, here's where the bad comes in.\n\nThe game plays like I'm playing a game on Facebook. If you had a stash of 35 food and then you quit the game to go do something else. Guess what? Once you come back to the game, you find out that your stash of food is only 10 and you'll have to spend all your hard work to go get some more. It ticks me off just to see a game that can play all by itself and then I come back to it, only to find that I'm doing worse than before once I come back on to play it. So it's either play this game after you get done with anything else or just stop playing it forever. Hey Undead Labs. This is Steam. Not freaking Facebook.\n\nAlso, this is just personal opinion, but I hate the special infected in this. I encountered a big muscular zombie and then once I got too close to him, he grabbed my survivor with his huge hand and ripped him in two. This is an instant kill as well and it doesn't matter if you have full or near full health. I wouldn't have a problem with this if they would only appear AFTER I got a bunch of stuff and survivors. But they seem to appear too early in the game and it's just flat out unfair to the player in my eyes.\n\nThis game can be unfair at times as well. For example, you'll be in a house with someone and you're trying to fight a few zombies that are attacking you. You are doing so great and you managed to beat them all. But then another zombie comes in and you're already out of stamina like you got freaking asthma. Hence, you can't fight as well if you don't have the stamina in order to swing a weapon. But the stamina drains like you're swinging a freaking sledgehammer when you're not even using one and it regenerates so slow as well if you don't level it up early in the game. The difficulty in this game can either be flat out frustratingly annoying or just total cheapness.\n\nEven so, they even promised and announced multiplayer on certain websites on this game too. But boy we're we disappointed when this game got released. This is another big issue to me. I hate developers who don't bring something they promise to their games. Undead Labs, if you needed more time to implement multiplayer into your games, I wouldn't mind. Just re-schedule the release date. I'm a patient man. But no, instead they decided to scrap the idea and just release the game anyway.\n\nListen Undead Labs, you got a good game here. But unless you bring out a good game that doesn't play like a Facebook game, has challenge but, not at the very beginning and has something that you promised like multiplayer, I can't guarentee you're going to succeed as a video game making company. I'm talking to you as a gamer that knows what's best for the video gaming industry.\n\nThank you and good bye. But please don't let this review take you away from buying this game. If you can handle this game playing it by itself when you're not playing it and if you don't mind it being singleplayer, go ahead at buy this. But I recommend buying it when it's on sale like it is now.","June 21, 2014","false","25.5"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","13","21","0","5"

Still a bit rough, covered in (some) dirt and might need some extra cutting and polishing but it is a gem nevertheless. It's not awesomely perfect on the technical side (could have used a little more effort on the controls/interface for the PC version, for instance) but Undead Labs delivered the almost-nearly-perfect Zombie Apocalypse experience you can have within a game world today. This is the zombie game I always wanted to play and to enjoy for countless hours. They tried to add everything the "zombie genre" has, cramming it all inside a gaming experience and they succeeded in that. In this game you have everything you want your zombie survival game to have: a persistent and open world (that keeps on going even when your computer is turned off!), facilities to build and manage, resources to gather, trust to gain, pep talks, scavenging, gossip, pills, vehicles to drive (and to break down to pieces), people to care for (or to abandon to their fate if you don't trust/like them or if you are that kind of survivor), a lot of zombie head-bashing, a wide array of melee and ranged weapons, skills to improve (including useless and funny ones!), tons (and I mean TONS) of inside jokes, easter eggs and homages to the genre (The Kirkman Residence? McDermott's Tavern?), and a (virtually) never ending experience if you play with the Breakdown DLC (in that case, you skip the main storyline but you go on as long as you have at least one character alive). Co-op is missing. Co-op would have been great but, even as a solo game, State of Decay is a lot of fun, which is reason enough to play it, but you also start to enjoy it a bit more and more as you discover all the little details that are revealed only with an extensive playthrough. You need food, sleep, meds, gas, ammo (and not just generic ammo, but the right ammo type for your gun) and you need to find a good place to call home. A defendable one. To be on the (relative) safe side you will also need at least a doctor or someone trained in medicine, tool experts, carpenters and someone who can cook a good meal once in a while! A workshop where to build homemade sound suppressors for your guns or molotov cocktails is a must! Keep an eye on the morale of your community too. Don't let them fall to their fears and always resolve their anger issues (shouting matches lower community's happyness!). You start with one character only (well, two, in the main storyline) but you can swap to other survivors as you bring them to your community and only if you earn their trust. Bear in mind: dead is dead. If your character dies, it's gone, no matter how much time you invested in him/her. No matter if he/she was the "hero". And they can die in a lot of ways, even when you are not controlling them. They can go missing on a supply run (but you are given a chance to go look for them), get sick or be eaten alive while you ask them to watch your back. And when you run out of characters... well... new game, I guess! If you love zombies and everything about zombie survival and that it's the end of the world feeling, this is the game for you.","March 9, 2014","true","363.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bobirov/recommended/241540/","bobirov","Doge Bryant","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bobirov/","240 products in account","Fans of the Zombie Apocalypse genre should not pass this one up.  It is a good game despite its flaws.\n\nTo me, this game feels like what Dead Island should have been.  Things like having actual resource needs for your group and the ability to build and upgrade structures in your home base really help the game stand out from your generic zombie slaying fair.  Also the fact that events can happen while you are not playing, while it can be annoying, makes for a fairly unique game.\n\nI also really like the fact that you can be overwhelmed by zombies if you are by yourself and you aren't careful.  You can't just run out in the street and start mowing down zombies with an unsurpressed assault rifle.  For one, you'll quickly deplete your ammo supply.  And the other reason is because all the noise will draw out all the zombies in the surrounding area and you'll likely be overrun.  It really helps to add some tension when you are a long ways from home on a supply run and you're low on health and don't have a ride nearby.\n\nUnfortunately, the game is not perfect, and there are a few particular areas I feel the game is lacking.  The first of which to me is the camera.  The views for when you are executing zombies can sometimes make it impossible to see whats happening.  Also, the fact that you are encouraged to use foliage to hide from zombies, but the bushes/trees don't dim and go transparent when close to the screen makes for more times when you can't see anything.\n\nAnother feature I think this game could sorely use is some sort of weapon modding feature.  Coming off of playing Payday 2 with its amazing amount of weapon mods available, this game has none other than applying one of a few types of suppressor to guns.  It would be awesome if you found a weapon expert survivor and you could then mod your stocks, optics, foregrips and such but, alas, its not possible.\n\nAnd finally, perhaps the biggest ommission that could have really made this game a gem is its lack of a multiplayer mode.  While you can ask other survivors to accompany you and help out, you can't get them to pick up supplies or give them any orders when they are with you.  They also have a tendancy to follow you right up your butt and then block doorways behind you.  The AI just isn't a good substitute for a few good buddies.\n\nStill, despite lacking in some areas, this game is a fun single-player experience.  To me, it did a decent job of capturing the spirit of zombie apocalypse survival.  I'm hoping the game has a sequel with a bit more polish to put it into GOTY territory.","January 1, 2014","true","20.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This is ALL i have EVER wanted in a zombie game. It kinda reminds me of fallout. Anyway, the reasons i love it is:\n1. Free roam.\n2. Huge map.\n3. Has missions which you can do but are not obligatory.\n4. I love the fact that alongside the missions, you also need to find and recruit survivors, go scavenging to survive and also just generally look after your community and main base.\n5. I love the fact that you can set up outposts as well as a main base,\n6. The NPC survivors that you play alongside with are not stupid. they will go out on missions and scavenge on their own without you doing ANYTHING. Some will fall sick and die. And a lot usually get injured or merely tired. I also like that you can switch survivors to give the other ones a rest. All the survivors also have different abilities.\n7. It has cars. So it's basically just GTA with zombies in it.\n8. It's not JUST zombies you are fighting. The army also comes in, sets up outposts, and kills anything that gets in their way, wether it is a survivor or a zombie, they kill it.\n9. I love the building feature. You can select empty spots in your home base and build different facilities ike guard towers, medical facilities, fighting arenas and even farms. Of course to do this you need to find building resources so again, you need to scavenge a lot.\n10. The NPCs are really stong. If you're are going out on a missions, you can ask a couple of people to come and help you out. A group of 4 survivors could easily take around 200-300 zombies.\n11. And there is SO many more features taht are awesome that it would take ages to write them down.\n\nAnyway, if you have 20$ and like zombie games, this is the absolute BEST place to spend those 20$ and I guarrantee you will not regret it.\n","May 22, 2014","true","19.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Let's get the bad out of the way.\n\nThe biggest issues I had with this game were frame rate drops in certain areas at high speeds, some texture pop-in here and there, a few times zombies getting stuck on fences, doors and such.\nAnd now, the story.\n\nThe Story is nothing to get worked up about. 2 guys get back from a fishing trip to find themselves in a completely different world and it just sort of goes on from there. Nothing too spectacular or surprising really. I sort of figured where things were going before they actually happened. Let me be clear. I'm not saying it's bad. It's just nothing to write a bestseller or make a blockbuster movie about.\n\nThe graphics were not created to compete with Crysis or Metro. They did their job. It's not Borderlands 2, The Walking Dead or, as stated above Metro.\n\nThe gameplay is where the game shines. You get tossed in a bunch of small towns in Turnbull County. Minutes after you get past the whole this is what's happening and how you're supposed to play it part you make your way to the first safehouse. After that, it's all on you. To make it past that you have to break into houses all over the county to get what you need. Guns, materials to improve your house, meds, gas, guns, food, weapons, guns, ammo, other items and of course MORE guns to add to your storage and keep yourself alive and well.\nSpeaking of storage, State of Decay uses an interesting mechanic. You don't use money. I mean it is the end of the world basically. Instead, by completing story or side missions that pop up here and there once in a while you get to increase your fame. Fame is what limits the amount of influence you can get. Influence is won by looting items from said houses and dropping them in the storage unit and also by completing the said missions. The same influence is used to take items out of your households' or other survivors' storage. I know it sounds strange but I found out it works quite well.\n\nThe most important aspect of the gameplay is probably permadeath. In State of Decay you're not the hero. You start off with 2 characters of which one you control and quite soon you get to meet a 3rd which then makes the game reveal an important part of the game. Every person in the game has stamina and health, traits, skills based on traits and then unlockable skills once you get to a certain level. Your health goes down and die, you're done. Instead, if you have a good enough relationship with a character you get to select for that person to take charge and you get to play with the said person instead, in case you get hurt or get tired. You can't swap your charater if the relationship is too low, the game doesn't allow that in case of story-important characters or if that person is too tired or too injured. As such, even if you get over your loved (or skilled) charater dying, you need to keep your household happy, recruit other survivors to join your household by helping them stay alive long enough for your relantionship with that group to be high enough for them to want to join.\n\nAll in all, if I were to give this game a mark based on what it tried to achieve and what it actually achieved I would say a solid 8.5 / 10.","January 13, 2014","true","166.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

But I still liked it and I just finished it after restarting.\n\nFrom my understanding it is a smaller studio backed by Microsoft behind it and I say they made a good job. I did not notice many bugs or glitches. Graphics are decent and controls not bad -IF- you have a controller. It is also nice that you can avoid zombies and try sneaking (Which I didn't do much). As said the focus is more on survival and gathering resources and survivors for your home base instead of wildly shooting cause that will have you dead if you are ill prepared. And a dead character stays dead.\n\nThe characters you gather all have diffrent traits and "personalities". Which is interesting at  first but later on proves to be shallow. Non the less the more you gather the more room you need, the more food you need and so on.  Sadly the game do become a bit of a rince and repeat after a while when every mission is "Oh no we seen a special zombie out here" "Create noise to make the zombies do this while I plunder" or "Oh no scavengers in need of help". Also we got the "Sadness, anger, fear" traits where you just tell your friends that you and him/her are going to smack some zombies the old fashion way. This is one of the more annoying missions since they just about killing zombies and put you at risk just to appease some of the idiots in your crew. There is also missions to save or help other survivor groups. These could be so much more if they deepended the social mechanics and maybe added in more of an RPG mindset to the game.\n\nThe map is pretty damn big too and I did not scavenge much outside of any of the  three settlements. The country side is not that appealing since it is mostly wastes of land you drive through to g et to your next objective. But this adds to the atmosphere since it is supposed to be a small county with a large farming community.\n\nThis is a clusterf*** of a review but I still think the strong parts is the survival part, the less focus on action. The tiny bit of social interaction and dialogue (even if the voice actors where like 3-4? Least it beats the 2  guys making the voices for Skyrim! Hue hue) The atmosphere can be great at times and some vistas are nice.\n\nBUT. The game is bit to much of a repeat, there could been more interaction with your group and the others. The Wilkerson have some interesting missions but not much more than them being a bit of the Merle of State of Decay and then nothing happens. The game also would be much much much better with co-op or multiplayer where each player runs their own group. The special zombies are also kinda a pain the ♥♥♥. This must be some kind of thing from L4D.\n\nTo end it, yes I do recommend it if you want a open world zombie survivor game and zombie movie lovers will see many references. Also! ♥♥♥♥ you Ed for being such a cry baby. God damnit.","September 3, 2014","true","22.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

You aren't just one person, once you've befriended others who you help or save, you can play as them and improve their abilities to further enhance your chances of survival.  Once your community is big enough you can strike out and take over larger bases (there's three base sizes, small medium and large) or keep it small and stay somewhere outside of the towns.\n\nIt's not without its flaws, some zombies manage to clip through walls & doors either visually or physically, also executing them on stairs has issues and the vehicles are very floaty, it's amazing how high a truck can spin and flip.\n\nThe end of the world is a dangerous place, mutant zombies and roaming hordes can seriously make a supply run turn into a really bad day.  Running is the best option or a car if you can to get out of there when tables turn badly.\n\nThere have been two DLCs so far, Breakdown & Lifeline.\n\nBreakdown is without story and you play till you're ready and have fixed up an RV to escape the valley.  This causes the game map to randomise & reset and also makes the game harder, you can also unlock heroes who can help turn the tide.\n\nLifeline is a side story told around the same time as the base game, you follow a group of soldiers who have to hold onto their base camp while evacuating high value targets, usually those who have information/expertise with the "virus" and some civilians if you can.\n\nAll in all for a console port of an xbox live arcade game, it's pretty good and fun, the melee combat can be quite fluid and ranged head shots are an instant kill for most zombies.  The game also has a permadeath system where if you die you're gone and have to move on without that person.  I'd give it a solid 8/10, you can play it many ways and the dlcs add a lot of different options.","June 15, 2014","true","63.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

What can be uncool though is when you lose a character and you've invested so much time in them, you begin wondering how to turn off the auto save. Just a heads up before I start I couldn't believe when I was playing that this game isn't multiplayer - and that the idea of working with other people (or friends) would be awesome. I repeat : THIS GAME IS NOT MULTIPLAYER.\n\nDoes that mean don't play it? Depends...\n\nThe story goes you are a man who stumbled into town and upon exploring you find a church full of survivors. A bit later into the story, you hear the military has also set up an outpost in the town but on the other side. You go see them, and you find out that they really couldn't care less, and that they recommend you leave immediately.\n\nThe gameplay itself is pretty good - consisting of a 3rd person view and being capable to control more than 1 character... but you can only control one at a time. You can tell other characters to follow you and assist you or you can tell them to come search a location that you've cleared. There are times though where you are faced against this giant zombie boss and all you have is two bullets and a broken machete hoping to take this guy out (so FYI if you hate a bit of grinding in games you may dislike this). The repairing can become a nuisance, but building repair shops or first aid centers (of a few things that you can do) add a bit of depth to the game and really make it feel like it's yours. Another cool feature is when you clear out zombies you are able to set up another "home-base". Cars, weapons, items and so forth are found while you free-roam the map. Look-out points can be discovered and climbed which makes identifying what's in the surrounding environment a little easier.\n\nI like this game, I would like it even more if it had multiplayer. I enjoy playing it but some would put it as a time killer. Either way though if your looking for an open world zombie game this may be for you.\n\n7.65/10 - not the solid 8/10 as it is missing multiplayer.\n\nEDIT : Just beat the game... once it's beat it's sort of bland. Yes there's DLC but if your like me and do not like DLC this game is a good 14-15 hour run. There's also those who like to run around in an open world and just shoot zombies. If you like that then go nuts.

Not the fact that I put it away for a while to allow for the many many bugs...including the lack of screen support making the guns fire to the left of the target, be fixed. I come back to find this mess has been abandoned and "remastered". More likely they realized what a mess it was and just decided to cash in their chips. Heres the deal. Core gameplay problems is what I will concentrate on. Nothing about the developers screwing the fanbase over because there are a thousand of those rants right now.\n\nTo start with. This is not a survival game. Its a resource collection game with arcade physics thrown in to give you something to do while youre trying to keep your little base alive. You WILL spend most of your time wondering why you can just carry a damn bag in the trunk of your car. See....the game mechanic is this. Break into house. Random loot is in random places. Lets say food. You pack it up into a bag and carry it on your back.....to the car....that you drove there in. Now. Common sense says "Hey. Ill throw a bag in the trunk or the passenger seat.", or "Hey, I got a truck. Ill throw the bag in the bed of the truck and I can bring more stuff so I can play the game a bit and not worry about the food situation." Now we cant have that can we? 1 bag at a time sir. Regardless if you brought a pickup truck or a muscle car. The method of delivery is 1 bag at a time.\n\nWhile youre collecting those bags youll come across radio traffic in the form of side missions. usually its "Survivor X located at Y, go save them." That sounds simple but when youre literally in the middle of a mission and carrying a pack of supplies...its pretty much impossible to get there in time. Innevitabley they die and because of the "I hate your decisions" system built into the game, your damned squad gets MAD AT YOU FOR FAILING TO SAVE PEOPLE YOU HAVE NO TIME TO SAVE!!!!\n\nSo you say forget them. Ill just go back to base and turn these supplies in. All will be forgivien. Just about right. Except now that youre back the base is under seige. Right about the time that you come back. You have very little time to run back and forth, nailing boards to windows while your NPC buddies fire away, destroying the boards and....not really damaging any zombies that are crawling through. Eventually you get a few hits and some damage. Then survive the night. The "Seige" is what its called. Oh...but dont forget to kill ALL THE ZOMBIES!!! If you forget just one...anywhere...they will not stop the seige mode and more will come. I had a zombie stuck in a staircase that I couldnt kill and the seige just kept on until...well....I lost all my crew and myself. Lets assume for the sake of brevity that you manage to save the idiots standing around...I mean, your team mates. You have a broken leg. How? Zombie punched you in the arm maybe...who knows. Now we come to....\n\nTired and worn characters. Not only are your resources limited the characters you get to control are also depressive, unskilled, and sometimes just better off holding a grenade and running toward the largest hoard you can find. So here you are. Youve had the black dude with the vest or the military chick the whole time. Theyre the starting characters and quite frankly the best ones Ive found. LOVE the black dude in the vest. He weilds a sledgehammer like an anime warrior swings a mystic too big to hold sword at demons to split them in half! However...here you are. Unable to walk very far and tired. So you have to trade in. Cool...cool. Ill just use someone else. Its here that the game reveals just how hard it can push when it takes a dump all over you. See...the other characters in the game arent really all that useful. There are a few here and there that are ok but theyre all random when you get them. The way you mainly get them? Remember earlier when I said you gotta rescue people? Yeah. So anyways. Youre now forced to use some old lady thats an alcoholic chain smoker and has "A general knack for cleaning"........great.\n\nWell you use the old bag lady who clans house. You kill zombies and raid houses. Every 12 minutes a call comes through to "Return to base. We have a horde incoming!" Yay.......another siege. Its only been like....10 minutes and you just got to the actual story mission area. Nope. Head home and battle more zombies. Well now that youre finally here and collecting supplies while playing through a mission....boss fight. Great. Your bag lady just got killed. Now its back to the wounded guy from earlier. You use him and...well....you were too slow and now hes dead. You decide....Ill take a break.\n\nYou come back from said break, unaware that while youre gone...the game keeps on. So you come back to a game where some survivors took supplies to trade with other survivors, they didnt get back because they were trapped by a zombie horde, theyve lost your supplies, and now youve got to take "Jim Boscoe" to save them. Jim is a derelict, chronic alcoholic, that wheezes like an old school bus muffler and coughs up just as much when you rev the engine. Hes armed with a pole that he picked up and smells like a bag of feet. Go get em Jim!\n\nThats the biggest issue, The character "story" is generic as all get out. The intricat relation you thought you had between the military chick, black dude in the vest, and white dude in ugly shrt? Yeah...thats all for nothing as the dialogue is written in such a way that not only is it not changed....its CONTINUED IN EXACTLY THE SAME MANNER AS IF NO ONE EVER DIED!!! The story just chugs along like an Austrailian land train convoy! No impact. No repercussion , except that now instead of having an actual "hero" character...youre in control of a useless whino. Yeah...because thats what I want to be in a game. A whino with a length of rebar!\n\nLets just say for the sake of things you decide to run with this....you should consider getting tested at this point...youve had warning and I didnt. By the way...at this point can you tell this is  100 percent MY ACTUAL EXPERIENCE WITH THE GAME?!?! So youre Jim...the whino savior of the badlands. You climb into your muscle car and you just want to do a mission. You find the location is on the other side of the map and go. Because youve got no skills you decide to just use the car. Doing so destroys the car and when you get out to switch you find the "stealth" element to Jim is severly lacking. There is NO DAMNED STEALTH ELEMENT! You are either behind a wall or you are seen. End of. The people who claim there is a stealth element are lying. Period. There is a stealth element attempted but not implemented all the way. So what you get is guess work instead of applied skill. I guess it adds to the "intensity" but at this point the "intensity" is annoyance. You get to the mission area....youve thus far ignored at least 2 cries for help, a person trapped in a siege building, and a siege at your own base...because screw it you just want to plod on with the mission!\n\nFinal problem. Joe is underpowered. Yeah. See. Games like Da-Z, Project Zomboid, H1Z1, The Dead linger...theyre all like this game in some ways. Theyre all worse and better so Im not advocating any of them individually, however, they did get one thing right. See. State of Decay has zombies that ar at different difficulty to kill. The Big'uns are FAR harder to kill and the Shrieker is the highest priority to kill. Well. The characters that are capable, the ones you worked on to get to that level, the ones you spent the last 6 hours of gameplay on....theyre all dead. Jim has a lenght of rebar to fight 2 armored zombies, a Big'un, and a shrieker....who are all in front of the mission building. You say "Screw this. Im running these cats over!" Then you find out that hitting the Big'un destroys the car. Now your car explodes and Jim is dead.\n\nThis, unfortunately, is the game.","April 17, 2015","false","24.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

I was watching the alpha/beta development of this game for a little while, and while I liked a lot of what I read about it, looking at the content didn't look 'refined' enough.\n\nThe gameplay is not anywhere as smooth as I had hoped and it's hard for me to get past the pre-rendered animations for literally every action. In the beginning I was watching my npc friend attack a zombie and you could see when each attack animation would create a 'stutter' between the next attack.\nRight in the beginning I watched a zombie trap it self climbing up a ledge, clipping back down, then repeating over and over again.\n\nThe controls as a whole feel awkward to command and execute, with a lot of fine mouse sensitivity just to execute bulky, long animation sequences.\n\nThe camera doesn't zoom out very far at all either. For an open world zombie game, your field of view  feels kind of narrow and your character takes up a good size on the screen.\n\nThe gameplay is nothing like Left 4 Dead, but more like a more arcade gamestyle of Dead Rising with  a Dead Island feel.\n\nYou do get vehicles in this game though, and they handle really nice. They drive with a good weight to them, rather than the sometimes glidy feel of running around in the game.\n\nMy biggest gripe about the game is all the heavily scripted actions, which doesn't work when the combat generally tends to be just button mashing, making your character attack at nothing a few times to catch up with all the times you mashed the attack button.\n\nI don't know how much can be improved upon with patches and this first game is rather bumpy in a lot of ways and would only recommend to buy on sale, I could definitely see this turning into a worthwhile series. The gameplay is unique and interesting enough that it can definitely be worth expanding on.","November 28, 2014","false","21.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/captainstardog/recommended/241540/","captainstardog","Fireballs of the Eucharist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/captainstardog/","161 products in account","If someone created a tetrahedron (just roll with it) of zombie apocalypse entertainment with Left 4 Dead at one corner, No More Room in Hell at another corner, The Walking Dead at a third corner, and DayZ in the final corner, State of Decay would be somewhere near the gooey, festering, dead center of such a divine tetralogy of terror. This is my first enduring impression upon completion of the main storyline after marathoning 26 hours game time over the course of about 36 hours from point of purchase. I have yet to try the DLC, so my review covers the basic game only. I will try to keep spoilers to a minimum.\n\nYou and a buddy have gone camping and are on your way back to civilization only to find that the campgrounds have become picnic at the park for zed. Your job is simply to survive and learn to survive more successfully and efficiently. As you make your way in the world, you find yourself essentially trapped within a large valley of small communities and farms with a few souls and a whole lot of folks who’ve no longer any use for theirs. You’ll see a lot of tropes and types that are standard for the genre, but most of them are written in a way that downplays their commonness and gives them the dignity of a measure of individual identity and unique situations. You’ll find that vehicles work pretty much as you’d expect them to—often to your advantage and, now and then, to your sorrow. You’ll learn quickly that the world reacts to your decisions in mostly logical ways and that, among the precious assets that will remain largely too sparse for your tastes, human beings matter greatly to you and your prospects for survival. Influence will become your currency. Interactions will become your keys to more currency, technology, and even more assets. Your chances will depend solely upon your actions and choices, but your outcomes will almost always depend upon how your actions and choices affect others. For a relatively small solo game, I never felt that the world was hollow or empty, or that I was truly playing alone the way you feel if you solo some games.\n\nThe Good:\n\nOptions. High degree of player interaction with environment and characters which carries lasting impacts. Ambitious design. Homage to the genre. Moments of pleasant surprise and genuine anxiety. Humor that is often subtle. You will roam a mostly open world with some depth of detail that I think may pleasantly surprise you at times. You choose how you will play, where you will go, and what you will do. If you play smart, the game will reward you. If you take foolish risks, you may find yourself sorely punished—likely, but not a guaranteed always. On a single run through from beginning to end, I found myself still trying to figure out certain triggers for various spawns and events, and that’s a good thing. It promises a level of continued interest for future game sessions. If you tear up a vehicle, it will break down, and even possibly explode. If you toss a flare or firecrackers in the night, you will attract a lot of unwanted attention, but you will also be able, if you’re quick and quiet enough, to take advantage of the diversion to make an escape. There’s a lot more I’d love to share, but some things are more pleasurable discovered on your own. If you’re paying attention as you go, you may notice a good number of locales or situations clearly intended as tributes to the genre greats, both to creators and to the works they created, and it comes off not simply as a checklist but as an honest homage. If you get the game, take time to revel in the sensation of racing down a country road in the night with your headlights off while swerving slightly to the side and opening your driver’s side door to take out an entire horde of zombies and freaks. Take a moment in the twilight to look out over a field of crops to see shambling silhouettes against the outline of a rolling landscape under an open country sky. Savor the tremor in the dark as you explore a quiet shed only to discover that you aren’t alone in there after all. Thrill to the delighted frustration of attempting to run down that creepy thing that moves just too darn fast and vaguely spider-like along the edge of the road. Regret smacking indiscriminately into that just-one-more batch of zed that somehow left such a foul aftertaste.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nFirst, the downside to being such an ambitious game that aims to honor and do so much is that it has its limitations. I found myself in a few spots just wishing the game would go farther in a certain way to take things further in certain options that just weren’t available sometimes. I wanted more management options for people. I wanted a better explanation at times for certain things, though I think that the hands-off approach to this game actually improved the experience overall for me. I found other limitations, which I won’t share because I don’t want to spoil the fun but you are free to discover them for yourself.  Second, there were some moments when I felt the actions or dialogue of characters in the game were completely transparent as vehicles for forcing my attention in some direction. I didn’t like that at all, but thankfully this did not happen too often. Third, while we’re talking about dialogue and actions of characters and game limitations, I found it strange that a game that places such a high emphasis on influence would present me with so few opportunities for deep interpersonal interactions. Conversations, too often, are limited to, “Hey, what’s the sitch?” and that’s it. Not even an option given to answer that question. Fourth, a few persistent glitches in the game. I noticed a change in the condition of vehicles where you pass by one time and it’s in good shape and the next time it’s dinged up, but then the very next time you pass by it looks perfectly fine. Some people showed up as having run away from my compound, but were actually still living there and were still available as controllable characters. Fifth, companions hit some trigger point where a mission, a conversation, or some other key like stamina tells them it’s time to go home, and they run off. Even if you’re on the opposite side of the map with a perfectly good vehicle and getting ready to get in and drive home, they will run off across the countryside full of wandering hordes and freaks, sometimes creating a hazard where you have to rescue them in the process. I think this is a result of the game’s having been developed to emphasize stealth over combat. However, I played using reserved force and stealth, and all-out Car Wars/Death Race 2000 driving mentality, and found I did quite well.\n\nThe Ugly:\n\nThe game is a PC port from console and it shows. It’s not nearly as bad as some games I could mention, but the console history of the game makes certain things awkward for PC players at best. Playing with keyboard and mouse worked just fine, but sometimes I would discover a move that I couldn’t quite easily reproduce and it makes me wonder if it was supposed to be triggered by a combo that I just haven’t figured out on K&M control. That being said, mostly, to anyone who didn’t know it was a console port or had familiarity with the differences in play and feel, I don’t think anything more than the autosave function and a few other clues give it away. That’s not too bad a complaint for the ugly. Also, and this is my biggest beef with the game, I found the best compound for my strategies in the game broken or nerfed (I couldn’t tell which) in an incredibly stupid way:\n\nThe rest of my review (you're getting very near the end of it) appears in the comments section below because I've run out of room again.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/larexus/recommended/241540/","larexus","Larexus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/larexus/","433 products in account","State of Decay is a open world survival game that will please fans of the genre with its own unique ideas and a focus on character permadeath.\n\n--------Final Thoughts at the bottom--------\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay is all about survival, it really makes you feel like you want to live. This is mainly due to the fact that if the character you are playing at the time is somehow killed, then they are dead for the rest of the game. Their is no way to bring them back to life, this makes you think twice about just trying to hack your way through hordes of zombies.\n\nThroughout the game their are moments, such as events or story missions that will pop up, about other survivors in trouble, completing these missions brings more survivors to your base. The higher your populations the more well defended you are and the more characters you have to switch out with to play. Each survivor has its owns traits and sets of skills. These skill levels can be raised by performing the activity related to the skill. For example your shooting goes up the more you use weapons, or stamina will increase the more you use the character to run around and loot with that character. However the more survivors you have at your base, the more supplies you will need to take care of them all. This means you need to go out and collect more loot.\n\nYou collect resources such as medical, building and weapon supplies, by entering abondoned buildings and searching for cuboards, draws, boxes etc.. that are highlighted white. When a supply stash is found you put it into a dufflebag and take it back to base. This however limits how much you can take at a time, if you have a vehicle you can store duffle bags in the back but if you are without a vehicle you may also radio back to base and have another runner come out to get the rest. However doing this will put that runner at risk of attack by zombies and if they run into trouble you may need to go out to save them. You may also loot various other things in buildings such as weapons, medical supplies, and food. Different weapons have different strengths and weaknesses. The weight of some weapons will also effect how some characters can swing them depending on thier strength.\n\nThe controls feel very well done and accurate, whether its swinging a weapon, shooting a gun or driving a vehicle, it all feels smooth.\n\nGraphics\nThe graphics are nice, I wouldn't say they are amazing or anything, although their are some breathtaking areas within the game world. The zombies look well done and their are a decent amount of models that are used so it doesnt feel like your killing the same thing over and over, however their is only one model for each special infected.\n\nThe animation is good and feels lively. Although sometimes I did feel like, for how fast my character was running I wasnt going very far distance wise. The swinging and shooting looks good and my framerate never dropped even while fighting multipul zombies and Im only on a medium spec PC.\n\nAudio\nThe sound in the game is good. When out in the woods you can hear the birds and crickets around you. When in town the lumbering steps of zombies can be heard all around you. The foot steps sound realistic for the type of platform your character is on at the time. Guns sound good and hitting zombies with melee weapons sounds satisfying.\n\nThe voice over work is good, nothing fabulous or game changing, but its good. Their are multipul different characters taht are all voiced however some of them sound like they were voiced by the same person and didnt even try to sound different.\n\nStory\nThier is not much to say story wise. There is a story that will eventually lead you out of the city and end the game. However the story plot is basic and it seems like it was just shoved in their to appease some people who want to complete it, but it is not neccesary.\n\nFinal thoughts\nOverall, State of Decay is a great game that is definetly worth the time for anyone whos a fan of survival or zombie games. It is a large world to explore and loot with many different survivors to save and add to your community. The game has some fresh ideas from other zombie survival games, and these ideas are portrayed very well. The visuals are nice and the animation is good. The permadeath may set some people off from this game, also if you are looking for a story, this may not be the game for you.\n\nIn my opinion this is one of my favourite PC games and is fully worth the full price, however be aware that their is a remastered HD version coming out soon so you may want to hold onto your money for that one. (EDIT: After the release of the remastered version I would still recommend this version over the newer one. The new one just spruced the visuals up a bit but change very little in terms of gameplay. If you want to save some money, just get this version.)","January 28, 2015","true","22.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Too small map to explore for anything. If it is an open world then better be a world at least. also everywhere seems so similar and anyplace you make a basecamp, it is almost impossible to stretch out after you reached certain point. I really look forward to see some other types of environments in bigger size.\n2. Max stamina or stamina itself is way too limited so you can't really have any fun. Yes, it meant to be a realistic game but it's rediculously SHORT as if the Z-virus in game clogged half lung of every characters in this game.\n3. The resources are way too short... also even when you found a bag of something, the actual contents in the bag is almost nothing. Hand full stuffs when you break the bag. You are forced to keep on scavenging resources all the time makes you worried about them even when you are on a mission and never have a fun of hitting a jackpot. NEVER.\n4. No story what so ever. Well, some of you may say the entire purpose of this game is only surviving... I know that but it could've been something more, something even better than TLOU.. who knows?\n5. Lack of vehicles, vehicle space for bags... and they are... made of soft cheese cakes. pretty sure.\n6. Scavenging noise = fire arm noise... really? of is that also part of the "reallity" part?\n7. lack of ammo.. really...awww... I thought the game takes place in US but the amount of ammo makes me feel like I'm in somewhere else.. it's f**** zombie game! I want to enjoy shooting at zombies...\n8.

Even though they have a character level systems and stuff but players can't really enjoy.... why? you will never really get much reward of making your character stronger.. just... too small...\n11.

You'll genuinely miss what they brought to the table as all of their upgraded parish with them.

And i DO recommend it to anybody specifically intrested in these three setting options of the process of wasting your free time (though i think it's not that much of a time-waster as my record says, i often leave a game paused while being busy).\nWell, a little doubt on "horror", maybe i've just been killing too many undead in games and got used to see and hear and fight them with no proper emotions). But sometimes in tough moments the game  gives a feeling similar to fear, as you really don't wanna die yet know its quite possible or almost about to happen.\nTo quit with the horror part - zombies look nice, especially those partly decomposed ones and the bloater.\nMaybe the biggest lack of the game is no first person view option available to take a closer look at these ugly bustards before killing them. The same about car driving, wouldn't hurt to have it in first person too.\nBut all done well enough as the third person game.\nSurvival is good to great, though most of it's components eventually get more or less repetitive and boring. But that's just like in any other game. The worst of unpleasant impressions i had was of those situations when you die because while you were killing three, five more came and while you were finishing them off there were seven more coming and so on until you've spent all your means of survival. When you get used to a game and start relying on your own honestly acquired skill more than on the character's abilities and inventory, it makes undesirable deaths inevitable too often, and leaves an irritating feelling of being trapped by developers in some preplanned different from the normal gameplay circumstances. I believe that's just what it is, but ok, it's all my personal impressions and unlike in many other games doesn't affect much the possibility to move on along the game's story and finish it before you feel you've had enough of someone's perverted imagination and can't afford wasting more time on it).\nZombiez as i've already said are looking great, the same about the ways they move and act, they are intresting to deal with until you get too tired and there's too many more closing on you. So, fellow players - keep an eye on it in order to lose less characters, and keep in mind all the ways you find out (there are some)) to quit fighting and start saving your ♥♥♥ at the right moment.\nThe game currently seems to be well optimised, there was no crushes or any other serious issues during my first playthrough. A few bugs spotted in the second which is not finished yet, but all rare, harmless, insignificant and not affecting the gameplay quality. And often looking funny btw, like a zombi, killed together with a group of others by the rear bumper of the slowly moving car, starting to turn somersaults after several seconds of lying on the road).\nTo developers - thanks for the great game, it was and still is a really interesting experience. Sorry for buying it on sale, it's worth its price, and i'd pay it if the sale wouldn't have occured, as the game's screens, vid and description were looking promising.\nPS Apologies for my presumably non perfect english.\nPPS The new dlc Lifeline is finally working. Looking and playing good. And there's plenty of ammo from the very beginning, which was the most pleasant feature to me  for the first hour of playing! Along with the new locality and cars durable enough like in the original SoD (and unlike Breakdown's ones trying to break even before you start breaking them).","March 22, 2014","true","406.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Spooky when looting houses\n• Play stealthy or reckless; Smash zombies with Car Doors!!\n• Addictive: I spent 12 hours with the game on first day of purchase!\n• Google x360ce if you want to use a controller other than the x360 controller. You'll be glad you did.\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=\n\nSo addictive, State of Decay will keep you hooked if you are into stealthy survival, gathering goods, managing a community, zombie combat/survival-horror or just about anything else this game offers.\n\nPlay with reckless abandon, charing into the fray with your Guns or Melee weapons, to achieve your goals, or stealthily sneak around the walking dead to search houses for food, water, ammo, building materials or other people for a greater chance of survival.\n\nMy favorite things about this game are the gathering aspects, the building of the base-camp, building a community with NPCs and managing Food, Medicine, Building materials, Ammo and vehicles.\n\nMy number one favorite thing about this game, in terms of play-mechanics, is quite simply; The awesome option of smashing zombies with your car door as you go careening by (or repeatedly slamming your car door into a zombie who fell over).\n\nThe biggest and most obvious gripe about this game, is the complete lack of any co-op or multiplayer modes. This game is wonderful as it is, but it would be amazing as an MMO or at least LAN Co-Op.\n\n*** This Game is NOT Co-Op or Multiplayer: SIngle Player ONLY. ***\n\nThankfully, the developer, Undead Labs, has another game in the works (currently known as Class 4) based around the ideas of State of Decay. State of Decay can even be viewed as a testing game for their Online version of State of Decay/MMO Survival horror.\n\nThe graphics, spooky lighting and atmosphere are all in line with a game of this type and are done well. Many times I found myself turning off the flashlight becasue it kept attracting Zombies, so searching through abandoned houses for supplies in the dark (while hearing zombie moans ...somewhere close by) is a pretty creepy feeling and really adds to the suspense of the game.\n\nThe audio sounds a bit quiet, on my rig anyways. I have to turn my speakers up a bit to hear the game at better sound levels, even with the audio sliders at max in the settings. As long as you don't expect any other sounds from your system while playing this game, it works just fine. If you get a message from a friend on steam (or other service) while creeping around a house being stealthy, with the audio up to hear this game, expect to jump in your seat!\n\nOverall, this game is really enjoyable to me. Open world Survival-horror with many RPG-style elements, building of communnities/outposts and NPC interactions just really help this game along. Again, it's not multi-player, but its a damn good game, in my opinion.","October 10, 2013","true","23.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Not to mention completely and horribly broken with poor voice acting, animations, movement, controls and optimisation (I'm looking at you, Dead Island)\n\nThis, however, is the opposite. It's not only got a bit of uniqueness to it but it's actually good. Rather than write a wall of text I guess I'll do a list of pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n- Well optimised\n- Nice, balanced combat\n- Not a zombie game that concentrates on firearms, rather a sensible mix of both melee and ranged\n- Makes the player use their brain, strategy is important in this game, going scavenging without a plan is a death wish\n- The AI is actually helpful\n- Pretty nice graphics and sound\n- RPG-like elements which're good for levelling each of your combat-able survivors at camp for different roles\n- Always something going on to keep you busy\n- There's other survivors in the world that you can get friendly with, the friendlier you are the more likely they are to help\n- No intrusive HUD, leaves the screen wide open for players to see everything they need\n- 3rd person games aren't usually terrifying, however this is. If you're stuck alone outside at night with hordes surrounding you, you'll be scared to move just in case they hear you.\n- The survivor you're playing as gets tired as they explore, or they get injured the more fights they get into, it adds realism to the game\n- Building on the above pro, character switching is seamless and easy.\n- It's just an awesome game\n\nCons:\n- Voice acting isn't fantastic, but it isn't as bad as some. You'll hear everything survivors say after a few lines of dialogue before they start repeating themselves. However, this is an indie game and the gameplay more than makes up for it\n- An unfortunate lack of co-op play, I'm not sure whether or not the devs are looking into it for the 2nd expansion, I hope so because it would be a lot of fun!\n- It seems as though you're made to play round the clock, as one survivors goes to rest or heal up, you have to play as another and go out to explore. Whilst it does add more gameplay value, I'd prefer to run around in daytime more often\n- The addon - Breakdown - removes the storyline element from SoD, allowing you to do whatever you want to. You can do that in the base game, just don't complete the last story mission, however it's still worth getting\n- Sometimes zombies like to get stuck under things, making it impossible to kill them. It's especially irritating when they're an enemy you need to kill for a mission.\n\nI'm sure I've forgotten some things, but overall it's an awesome game, it's worth the £15 I paid for it.","December 26, 2013","true","19.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Other than it may well be the best zombie-survival I've ever had the pleasure to play. Especially when combined with some improvement mods available at the SoD Nexus. For example the possibility to transport supply-dufflebags in any pickup (thanks to modders adding physics to the said dufflebags), removing the zombies glowing eyes, and to top it off; only walking zombies, and a special infected-remover. Because let's face it... all zombie games with special infected is getting tiresome. What's wrong with a classic zombie experience?\n\nAt any rate, I've spent a good chunk of hours in it. And the Breakdown DLC only improves with the new sandbox-mode. All in all... should you hesitate. Check out some gameplay in Youtube. I'm more than convinced that I'll be spending countless hours in this game in the coming year (if not years).","January 29, 2014","true","65.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Everything is auto saved as you play so if that lone scavenger get ripped apart by zombies, sad day. This game uses the "guns attract zombies in a 1 mile radius rule" so you have to get silencers to use guns effectively otherwise you shoot two zombies and four more show up. This game also uses a base system for survivors so you can choose what modules for your base you'll need like beds for people to sleep and/or a medical tent for injuries.\n\nMy negative experiences are when meleeing something the auto target will expose my back to other zombies who happily latch on and deal a lot of damage and the game won't let up with the missions most of which are time based as a survivor will need help. In addition, this game tracks your out of game time and reduces resources accordingly. Why? Why does this game need to function like ♥♥♥♥ing farmville in this regard?

Everything is auto saved as you play so if that lone scavenger get ripped apart by zombies, sad day. This game uses the "guns attract zombies in a 1 mile radius rule" so you have to get silencers to use guns effectively otherwise you shoot two zombies and four more show up. This game also uses a base system for survivors so you can choose what modules for your base you'll need like beds for people to sleep and/or a medical tent for injuries.\n\nMy negative experiences are when meleeing something the auto target will expose my back to other zombies who happily latch on and deal a lot of damage and the game won't let up with the missions most of which are time based as a survivor will need help. In addition, this game tracks your out of game time and reduces resources accordingly. Why? Why does this game need to function like ♥♥♥♥ing farmville in this regard? You're telling me unless the survivors have the player as their motivation they just ♥♥♥♥ around waiting to die?

You're always on the edge of death and the one stupid mistake you make will be the one that does you in. It's not a hardcore simulation like Day-Z, nor is it at all multiplayer; nevertheless, the primary game is compellingly open-ended and you will make decisions  that allow some characters a chance to live and guarantee others will die. Sometimes, you'll have to make those decisions when your stamina is all gone, there's no cars to escape in, you're at half health because you haven't rested in days, you have 3 bullets, a damaged baseball bat, and a horde of biters moving to your position. Maybe you pop a morphine and hide in a bush until they pass, but you still have a long way to go to get home.\n\nWhile I am positively bullish on this game, temper your expectations. State of Decay is an indie game ported from XBLA. The controls are not tight, especially for mouse and keyboard. They are a little off-putting at first and you'll require time to adjust. The graphic style is fitting, but the graphic quality itself is not above average for 2013. It runs well enough, but you will not see a perfectly smooth framerate throughout; it'll drop at odd moments. Sometimes you hit a zombie with a finishing move and it'll be in slo-mo, but other times you wonder if the game is stuttering or if you're supposed to be seeing something awesome, but you don't know what it is. However, I predict that none of these presentation deficits will stop you from seeing the vision behind the game and getting immersed in it.\n\nThis is a game that I would like to see a sequel for in about two years. I have not played the Breakdown DLC which removes the guiding storyline of the primary game and lets you just play the map. Though I look forward to trying it out next Steam sale. The developers had initially planned for the game to go multiplayer, but that effort has been canceled. Although, the developers promised that the sequel will focus on that feature. However, there are a lot of ways I could see the multiplayer game not being as compelling for me since I might lose the power to make decisions for my people. The comparison to Tell Tale's The Walking Dead are unavoidable and as with that game, I see this game gaining little from a full on multiplayer experience. Maybe if they made multiple maps and severely limited the number of players on each one so that each player could recruit their fair share of NPC survivors. Bottom line, if you see the game on sale, you might as well pick it up. State of Decay is all about risks and the "fun" you have taking them.","December 18, 2013","true","58.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's fun the first time through. It'll take you about ten hours to get through the entire main storyline IF you take your time. It took me twelve hours to beat it and then I didn't want  to play it anymore; however, the DLC makes it much more playable for repeated runs.\n\nY'see, the problem with State of Decay is that it just repeats scenarios, over and over. You wind up doing the same thing so much that you start losing interest. Sometimes tedious little quests will pop up that you don't want to do, but you have to, otherwise, the game will end before you get to the end. And that sucks, trust me.\n\nThe good things about it, though, is the strange array of characters that you can gather. Most survivors that are in your group you can play as and each survivor has a different set of characteristics (some traits make the character better. Some traits make the character worse). If a character in your group gets infected, you can ask them to leave, let them stay and do nothing about it or kill them. You have to keep track of your supplies too. You can't survive a zombie apocalypse without any food, so, if you have the materials for it, you can actually build a garden for a steady supply of food at your base... Farmville rip-off (THAT WAS A JOKE, DO NOT TAKE ME SERIOUSLY!).\n\nIt's a good game. It's not amazing, but it's worth at least checking out.\n\nIf you get State of Decay, I highly recommend that you also get the DLC (Breakdown) as well. It's basically "endless mode" for the game, rather than stopping when you hit the final mission. Unless you're only looking for about ten hours of gameplay: the DLC is a must!\n\nIs it worth twenty dollars? Probably not. Is it worth ten?

Some of the realistic take-downs still make you cringe no matter how long you play (may be a con for some, but it's supposed to keep you cringing, well done here).\nI enjoyed that the missions weren't all time sensitive, nor were all urgent to your gameplay. But still enough were to keep you on your toes.\nVehicles offered to choose from all varied in handling, speed and passenger capacity. Making it necessary for you to find the right vehicle for the right job at times.\nLarge enough map for the time-frame it takes to make this game happen.\n\nCons: I felt there was more that could have been done before ending as quickly as it did, though there wasn't any forced ending really, if you didn't know what was coming, you would just wind up with it ended. I suppose it had to get there some time. State of Decay Breakdown addresses this by giving you a choice as to when you want to boggie out however.\nUI: needs a search function, or a filter when faced with finding characters in your group to choose from. At 40+ to choose from it's tougher to find who you need relatively quickly.\nThe tutorial could have been a tad more interactive. In-game tuts irritate me, but only if I've seen them already. So in-game tut plus a toggle wouldn't hurt. Though learning hands-on is doable.\n\nGame function itself was great. Absolutely nothing mentioned in the "cons" was game breaking by any means.

For me this was a great disappointment.\n\nThe game was clunky, glitchy and very much the same worn out open world idea that ubisoft ran into the ground.\n\nSince most of the feedback already tells you what's nice about it here a couple points you might like to know about to go in with better expectations than i did:\n\n- It's your run of the mill open world game. You go places, numbers go up. Don't expect it to be more.\n- It's really really ugly. I don't care much for graphics but not even "we're open world" can brace you for graphics of this. The screenshots look ok, a bit better than the game on max settings, but what really kills it is the abhorent animation quality.\n- You will die randomly in fights and zombies will teleport and spot you through walls. Just happens. It won't ruin your day but it really can bug you if you think you're save and randomly a zombie walks through a wall.\n\nIt's a shame as the interface design is quite indeering and reminded me of a couple zombie survial flash games.","December 12, 2014","false","2.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

É mais fácil imaginá-lo como um grande simulador de apocalipse - no caso, de zumbis. A função do jogador é controlar não apenas um, mas vários membros de um grupo de sobreviventes com a missão de formar uma comunidade segura e funcional, garantindo os recursos necessários pra ficar de pé.\n\nÉ preciso lutar contra hordas de zumbis, revirar cidades desertas em busca de suprimentos, evoluir seus personagens, melhorar sua base improvisada, salvar aliados em apuros, fazer "comércio" com comunidades vizinhas e resolver conflitos internos. Parece bastante coisa, mas logo as mesmas "quests" começam a se repetir e o jogo cai na mesmisse. O pior: na tentativa de se tornar mais dinâmico, o jogo exagera na quantidade de missões que exigem a sua atenção por vez, muitas vezes anulando a aparente liberdade que o título oferece.\n\nSem falar que não há quase nenhuma explicação sobre suas mecânicas, o que obriga a jogador a passar algumas horas tentando adivinhar como alguns elementos funcionam. (procure tutoriais na internet!). A jogabilidade em terceira pessoa é divertida e responde bem aos comandos. Jogar com um joystick é mandatório. Os gráficos são bons, especialmente os efeitos de iluminação. Porém, a resolução baixa das texturas (por ser um port direto da versão de X360) é notável, além de que as animações deixam bastante a desejar em alguns momentos.\n\nMesmo com a mesmisse das quests, a falta de um enredo consistente para estimular o jogador, e a ausência de um tutorial melhor, State of Decay é um ótimo open-world, viciante e divertido (até certo ponto), servindo especialmente bem a quem gosta de jogos de zumbi.\n\n7,5/10","August 5, 2014","true","19.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

No no, that is not it. Hmm, a gander of Zombies? Nooo. How about a pride of Zombies? Hell no! Aaaah YES. It is called a HORDE, a Horde of Zombies!\n\nAnd that is what you will be facing in State of Decay. Hordes and more Hordes of Zombies.\nBut you are not alone. There is lots and lots of melee weapons to help you deal with the problem and there is lots and lots of fire arms to help you deal with the pest. You also have your characters that level in this RPG game. You can go stealthy, high cardio and run faster and for longer than them Zombies or simply go guns blazing and melee weapons swinging. But you will also need your own group, you need to band together and form a group. Work with other groups around the town/state and help each other out or simply let them join your group and become a bigger group.\n\nYour brothers and sisters in arms will help you with your daily life in the Zombie apocalyptic town.\nThe larger the group the more mouths you have to feed, the more meds your will need and of course the more weapons/ammo you will need for your established base/group. On the other side the larger the group, the better the man power and better the protection. Your home is where you manage the group’s lives. Build a small infirmary, or upgrade your lookout tower for better protection and area coverage. However pick wisely, space in your walls is limited and you put people’s lives in danger every time you and your group go out for resources. On another note what would a Zombie Apocalyptic game be without the army? The army is also present but it seems they have their own agenda and could care less for the survivors on the street.\n\nBut how does it all end? What happens to your band of brothers and sisters? I guess you will have to find out for yourself?\n\n\nPros:\n-Fun Dialogue RPG Zombie Horde slaying game.\n-Story line is fairly good. Entertaining.\n-Weapons is fun and diverse, always fun to slay Zombies.\n-Your group can repair your decaying vehicles and weapons.\n-You don’t need to do the tedious runs over and over again, use your group to scavenge and deliver the goods you have discovered.\n-You have your group members at your disposal to help with runs and missions.\n-Setup more outposts for protection and ease of accessing the group stash.\n-Open world to explore.\n\n\nCon:\n-Graphics slightly out dated, but did not bother me that much.\n-Game was designed/created for Xbox 360/consoles and converted for PC.\n-Game feels a little too easy (however still challenging enough to be fun)\n-no Co-OP play.\n\n\nConclusion:\nI feel this game is worthy of your precious time. It is worth mine. If you can pick this game up on the Steam sale for $4.99 then it is a no brainer (bargain). I would not feel cheated if I was to pay $19.99 for it ether, game is worth the cash. I noticed majority of the players finished this game (main story) between 16-18 hours. I usually play slower and discover every nook and cranny myself. This game would have scored beter if it had the co-op. I presonally would love to build a base and go slay some zombies with my friend. I bought the two DLC's on Steam sale too, but have not played them yet. My score is based on the main game only. I have played this game for 8hours already and is hooked. Very addictive game. Go ahead give this game a try. I recommend it and would give it a personal score of 8/10.","September 1, 2014","true","20.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

What is lacking, though, is an innovative approach to the zombie-genre. Something with more depth than your average Resident Evil. State of Decay (SoD) might just be exactly that.\n\nSoD starts you off in medias res, with only you and your buddy stranded in the midst of an already ongoing zombie-apocalypse. The gameplay comes along feeling a lot like Dead Rising at first, but quickly shows it tries to take on more than just that. As you hack and slash your way through Northern American forests and farmlands (on a fairly large, open map) you will meet other survivors (not actual people, mind you - this is a singleplayer-title). Some might not be too fond of you and avoid contact, others might be willing to join up. Soon, you will have a quaint little base to call your (temporary) home and you will quickly realise that not everything evolves around YOU and the character YOU play.\nSoD claims to be a Zombie-Survival-Simulator - and this goes beyond simulating how to best dismember the undead. You will have to keep an eye on all of your "group", as all of them have roles to play. There will be relations between characters, tensions, scarcity of resources and so on. Maybe most importantly of all: No one is safe. Every character can die, yet in return you also get to play as anyone who has joined you.\nPlan your adventures carefully, take only what you need, call for scavengers, answer the calls of your fellow survivors and occasionally plow through a zombie-horde with a car. This should sum up SoD in essence.\n\nAll this glory does have its shortcomings, though. Missions will start to get repetetive due to their interchangable nature, many houses will look similar and the stuff you find in them is not very interesting. Being an Xbox-title originally, the game also looks a bit outdated and struggles with controls. An Xbox-controller is REQUIRED (quote from the store-page) to play this game, at least until they finish the mouse and keyboard controls in a patch.\nSpeaking about patches, this game still is in early development, so a lot of changes will be made in the future. It certainly is promising, just not quite the Next Big Thing.\n\n--UPDATE (Aug 2014): SoD does no longer REQUIRE a controller to be played, it now supports mouse and keyboard controls, HOWEVER I still recommend playing with pad as using your mouse will give you some rather twitchy controls.","October 23, 2013","true","11.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","2"

My first experience with this game was while it was an alpha and I am happy I waited to play for real until it was "finished".  For the most part the game is finished there are still some bugs that are silly and gamebrakeing.  (minor)   However what is broken in this game isnt really the game but the concept.  If you want your game to be hard as hell thats fine.  In fact its actually a really good thing as long as you follow a simple rule.  Either you allow the user to adjust the difficulty with silders, or if you still want hardcore to be the only mode you need to make sure that mode doesnt interefere with the fun.  And holy crap does that mode interfere with the fun.   Lets remember you cant really save in this game, you make a bad decision and too bad you now need to start over the WHOLE GAME!!  I could go on attacking this feature but I guess the fan boys would not understand.   If you buy this you will need to download the hack that helps to balance fun.  Even with that the game still kicks your butt with sending you on mandatory missions every minute or two.  Problem is that it can take 30 minutes or so to finish the first mission, so you are guaranteed to get screwed.   This isnt a game, its an attempt to **** with everyone who buys it.   There are good things about SOD, the game makes you care about the survivors and you can get into the game.   There is fun to be had here its just so impossibly hard to find and enjoy.   Graphics and color must be altered to create a look because otherwise it would be a crime.   I REALLY hope some moders get ahold of this one and make it playable.

In the game you have a "home base" which can be upgraded with 9 facilities, and also has  space for outpost to build. Outposts extends the safe area and have supply cache to restock your equipment. The game can be played id different ways, someone likes playing stealthy, others prefer brute force to complete missions. Ah, the missions; i found side missions a bit repetitive, but they are okay. Driving cars is useful but makes a lot of noise which attracts zombies. When you are at your base you can change the character you are playing if the other character is your friend. Changing is adviseable to let the used character rest to get their vitality and stamina back to maximum value. SoD is beyond my expectations, i recommended everyone who loves zombie games 9/10.","December 7, 2013","true","22.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

For me it's storyline from The Last of Us, characters and dialogues from Telltale's The Walking Dead, weapon crafting and time expiring events from Dead Rising, many side quests from Dead Island (ignore the one where the drunk guy asks you for alcohol), the real survival from Project Zomboid, horror mood from Resident Evil, open world from most of them and the multiplayer combining the best from Left 4 Dead and DayZ.\n\nState of Decay ads to that managing your own base and group of survivors. Game draws you in its world very quickly and is very addictive. There is always something more to do in it. But it lacks a good story and multiplayer. I can stand no multiplayer in it, but the good plot? Not so easy.\n\nWhat i mean is not that the game has no storyline at all. It has, but after a few missions the story of your survivor crew breaks off and you have to witness boring stories of army and some other groups. Most of people that joins your crew is generated randomly. They have no personality so it is hard to become acquainted with them. Death in State of Decay is permanent and hurts very bad, but it would hurt even more if you would knew these people.\n\nState of Decay is not an ultimate zombie survival game but it's really, really close.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CongaPyro/recommended/241540/","CongaPyro","Conga Pyro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CongaPyro/","311 products in account","This is the game I have been looking for since the Zombie Hype following "DayZ".\n\nIt combines a Survival Game with fun fights (nothing beats fighting zombies with wrestling moves), several home bases, which can be upgraded and customized for your way of playing and rudimentary role-playing elements.\n\nAnd it is all completely Single Player. For some this might be a reason not to buy, but for this player it was the argument that sold the game. The game has a permadeath system and adapted it perfectly for a SP game. The player does not start with "his own" character. You rather start the story join a group of survivor, all playable for the character.\nAll the characters in the game get exhausted and get debuffs through this. The player than has to return to the home base and choose another survivor to continue. This system is extremely fun as you can develop several different characters and ways of playing the game within one playthrough.\n\nAnother mechanic which makes this game great is the resource management. The survivors don't spend all day with slaying zombies and driving around town. Most of the time cabinets, crates and all kinds of storage stuff is searched and looted. The player has to do this as the home base needs four resources. Food, to keep everyone well fed; Ammo, with a lot ammo in stock the home base has a decent supply of ammo for every firearm; Materials, to build and upgrade the home base and outposts, and medicine, this act the same way as ammo does a lot of supply equals lots of drugs at the home base.\n\nThe most fun part of the game is the fighting. The player can either fight with blunt, sharp or heavy melee weapons or several firearms. The range of melee weapons goes from table legs to sledgehammers to cavalry sabres. Melee combat is mostly used in the game as guns are loud and the zombies react to sounds.\n\nThis review just touches the surface of the game but I really hope that it helped you in any way.\nWith best regards Invisiblo","November 25, 2013","true","18.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

There is a lot of Hate towards Undead Labs, over SoD being released way to early during Alpha, and it still being broken and or not finished! But they continue to apply Updates to the Base > Game  making it better each time. There are still a few bugs but I'm sure they will be addressed in the near future.\n\nI know there is still a lot of people not being able to play it because... Lets face it it's Poorly Optimized. Even a High End Rig can struggle playing it, but it's a Port from 360 and this may change in the future. I also experience a little lag from time to time, but it's not game breaking in any way for me. Usually when i enter Marshal it does it for a few seconds, then goes back to normal.\n\nFor me it was an over all fun experience. I enjoyed it the first play though, but it does has those bugs that.  Well just ruin the atmosphere of the whole Survival experience, when a zombie falls through the floor during a mission and you cannot progress without killing it... (But you cannot hit it underneath the dang house) can be frustrating and take the fun out of it.\n\nThere are Elements i wish they would have added or Left in as other people described from there experience on the 360 version. Like (Generators) i really liked that idea, and being able to (Load up your Truck) with Ruck Sacks when you find more than one.\n\nBut don't base your judgment on (Should i Buy this? or Not?), merely based on haters in the forums, you should always form your own opinion while playing it your self. I love Horror/Zombie games, i gave it shot and I'm still here playing it :) (Love the DLC More) and I'm still unlocking Hidden Characters!\n\nPlus there are frequent Sales on the Store and you can pick up a copy pretty cheap, so really you have nothing to lose it  is worth the Price, some may disagree but to each his own. It has it's flaws and it also has it appeals, below is a list of my Pro's & Con's for State of Decay.\n\nPro's of SoD:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1 - Open world you can explore freely, at times. (Some Area's Require Story Progress) to access them.\n2 - Drive any vehicle you want, and run down Hoards of Undeads! (You know you want to)\n3 - Change your Home > Base (Several Potential Home Bases) to choose from all over the map.\n4 - Build up your Base, to help you and your fellow Survivors... Well Survive lol.\nMedical Tent, Sleeping Quarters, Garden, Work Shop, Sniper Post, Library. - I forgot a couple.\n5 - Build Outposts, to better defend your Home > Base from random Hordes, and Zombie Spawns.  The number of Out Posts, is based on how large the Home Base is. It can be anywhere from 4 to 9.\n6 - Interact with any Person (NPC) you meet, some are Neighbors. And some are just trying to Survive!  And some are just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Bags... Yes i am referring to the Wilkersons... When they killed Becca i wanted  to drive to there farm house and burn it to the freaking ground!!\n7 - Enter/Loot any Building you may encounter, it's a large map so there is loads of places to Rob Blind :)\n8 - Befriend Survivors, and have them watch your back while your out in the world Scavenging.\n9 - Take part in Random Events that pop up, like Zed Hunting, or Besieged- odd name?\nAnd gain trust with them, eventually they will join you.\n\nCon's of SoD:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1 - Lilly Ritter... She can become quite annoying. While our immersing your self in the world of the dead, she will keep asking you to go here, go there, and just keep bugging you in general :(\n2 - Vehicle Physics, are still not the best. They are still Floaty at times, and the smallest thing like a "tiny Rock" can flip over your 4X4 truck going 25 MPH. Even after a few Updates Tweaking this feature. /Facepalm.\n3 - The Story is spotty and not really well done, at times if can leave you feeling lost and not sure what to next. And you can spend a lot of time just thinking WTF standing around... When it suddenly pops up telling you your next Objective to Progress the story...\n4 - The Survivors AI is really poorly done, you can spend a lot of time back tracking trying to get Him/Her unstuck from behind a gate they could have just opened /Facepalm. That and they often just stand around your home base not doing anything but eating up Resources. They will get (Stuck/Lost) a lot making it harder.\n5 - Looting a Building/Home, you will often find (Items/Weapons) you need but do don't have space for. So you will leave it in there and head back to base Unload and get side tracked. If you save Quit or Crash and load it back up they will be all gone, empty stash in the places you Scavenged...\n6 - Optimization Issues, the game still needs Tweaking and Feature Updates. Hell it took forever before they finally allowed us to Pre-Define our damn Controls! But the Options/Settings are still lacking and will need to be addressed.\n7 - Boarding up windows... Ok i love the feature of being able to fortify my Base or Random House by Boarding up the windows keeping the Dead outside, but it was poorly implemented. It vanishes if you travel to far away from the place you boarded up, and when you Quit and load back up it was all for not... Now i can see losing some to Zeds trying to break in while I'm away but really? Just randomly disappears not cool.\n\nBut that's always subject to change, like i said before they will be doing Updates to the Base > Game  and it can improve over time, but i like the game. Once i bought the DLC (Break Down) i just loved it because it removed the Story allowing me to really immers myself into the experince, i will do a review on BD next.\n\nI hope this helped some people, we all have different experinces when playing but overall it was a good game.","January 5, 2014","true","77.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

When I first started up the game, I instantly thought "Oh ♥♥♥♥, did I just buy Dead Island again?". The answer was no, I didn't. The first few missions and maybe first hour are pretty directed in terms of gameplay and missions but after that, it's a free universe. Gather survivors, supplies, weapons, cars, and influence through a series of life-threatening missions. Wipe out entire hordes of zombies so they don't attack home. Build medical tents, workshops, sleeping quarters, sniper towers, and much more! Drive around the graphically appeasing world but be careful! It might be tempting to run through hordes of Zeds but your car will take alot of damage! Here are some of the highest points of SoD:\n-Realism: melee weapons and cars all take damage after overuse. Nothing lasts forever!\n-Challenge: Zombies are actually dangerous and it is always better to avoid them. Don't rush into a fight, bullets are few and so is your energy\n-Immersive Environment: Witness the world fall apart around you. The military is not your best friend, niether is the established government in Marshal. Have the opprotunity to help total strangers or leave them for dead. It's the closest thing to a Walking Dead experience you'll get if you're looking for something like that.\n-Defensive Battles: Home is never perfect or completely safe. Zed hordes can rush in any moment if you don't control the population of them yourself. When they come, they come. They climb over walls from all directions and it becomes an Alamo-esque atomosphere. Hold or die, it's simple.\n-Death is a new begining: Since you can play as multiple characters, your death is not the end of the game. My first character, Marcus, I used to go out and look for survivors in the woods. I was surrounded by Zeds and torn apart. After one character's death, another one will give a quick eulogy and the whole camp's morale will go down.\n-Home: Make it your own and get involved in that well known zombie apocalypse drama. Keep the morale of your camp up by scavenging and defending against zed hordes. If one character in particular is saddened or angry, do a mission with them to boost their morale and keep them going. Random events will generate (gun misfire, arguments, etc) that all effect the morale of the camp.\n\nThe Bad:\n-Not fully optimized for PC: This is obviously a Xbox game, using a mouse can give you sometimes a more glitchy feeling. It does not fully hold back gameplay though, it can make it harder to get the full scope of your surroundings though.\n-Invisible walls: In houses or other structures, it is common for invisible walls to pop out of nowhere and you will have to shake your mouse vigorously to be free.\n\nAll in all, the game is great besides for those few bugs. 8.9/10!","November 28, 2013","true","18.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

Gets swarmed, dies\n\nDriving? Going 20 mph seems to make your car hop after hitting every decline on hills, couple this with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ airborne jet physics (get airborne and turn either left or right in air and you will see) and cars become a massive hinderance.  If you hit a bump while turning, may god have mercy on your players virtual soul because this game wont. It seems to forcefully eject you from the spinning car (because you know, hitting pavement at terminal velocity is a far better choice to the AI then waiting and carefully crawling out of the wreck. If you manage not to fall a large distance (either from flnging you off a bridge or in my case a highway) or somehow make it out alive, good luck getting all those things roger mcfirsttodie collected, because anytime, no matter what the circumstance, the car detonates with the fury of a thousand latinos.\n\nSpeaking of roger mcfirsttodie, this game makes it hard as all hell to actually go off on your own, which is cool, it is hard, it should be hard. so you grab an AI guy. now, this AI does all of the following.\n\nGets stuck on invisible walls\nmoves sometimes\nswings a toothpick\ndies horribly.\n\nthey cant carry rucksacks, they cant drive (dear god that would be a ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ anyway). they cant seem to do anything on their own (in base they would be as skilled as the offspring of rambo, mcgyver and james bond) but as soon as they need to step five feet outside to pick something up. They die, so anytime you get the ability to call in for a pick up, dont, just make it easier on yourself and your AI brethren and put a bullet in them.\n\nAlso, I know this was a big thing when I first played (I could only put up with an hour of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t on the main game and only played lifeline, although everything except for one problem still exsisted) was that stuff would happen while your offline.\n\nMeaning you could build this amazing base with the best people, and the ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥ hat of a sherif could execute every. single. person. just because he sneezed. Or in my case, send out eight people on a scavanger run and have them all die, then send more out to collect the stuff from the dead allies just to have them die more.\n\nNow, with the combat, the worst thing about this game, is that whenever you seem to be attacked. the camera decides that you need to see what nostril is stuffed up the most and not the zombie that made slight contact with you and now has teleported behind you, putting you in a master lock chokehold.  Melee and meh, its only good if its just 1v1, which will never happen, so guns, guns and ammo, and how you procure comes to ANOTHER PROBLEM\n\ninfluence, because ♥♥♥♥ you and your hard work.\n\nwhats that? you found a metric ♥♥♥♥ ton of weapons and ammo for the base, too bad you will never use it because influence is a spending thing (sort of like currency but harder to get, harder to maintain, and worth less) whats that? you saved that guys life and now need him for a mission? too bad son that will cost you about 200 influence.  Whats that? need ammo because guns are really the only thing that can save you (besides stealth but just wait, there is stuff on that_) thats going to be about 5 influence per bullet. Doesnt sound too bad, untill you realize how much you get for missions. or general supply drop offs, because after doing 10 or 15, you have the choice of refilling your ammo, or getting a follower. The twist? you need both to live.\n\nBut why use bullets when there is stealth?\n\nbecause all the missions require boots on the ground zombie asskicking.\n\nas for the free roam stealth it up,\nunless you need to enter a building\nmove mass quantities of stuff\nmove far distances.\nreally move at all.\n\nnow, lifeline, I like it, it puts the "military is at its end we are only people but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ are we not giving up" feel.\nthe good? it made influence more managable. granted the air supplies you order is ♥♥♥♥ing redundant because you need to pay influence to get it, then even more to use the items, but eh, its cheaper then the main game and it actually gives you chances to get good amounts of influence.\n\nthe cons of lifeline.\nevery. ♥♥♥♥ing. thing. and more.\n\nthe reasons listed are the reasons why I cant play this game, because I cant actually play it, When the game is so flawed to where you cannot do the basic things needed for simple objectives (ie. move to this spot, but wait, your character got stuck in a five foot space between cars) Its not a game, its just a POS that takes money.\n\nI still hope that eventually they will fix these listed flaws and if we are all lucky, like extremely lucky, like jesus came down to earth and defended all of the christains, christain lucky, all the other non listed flaws, this game would be a gem.","December 1, 2014","false","15.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","6","9","3","3"

The story doesnt really make sense as there is no real story as far as i can tell since you just get chucked in with endless missions. You end up doing the same mission pretty much all the time and gets kinda boring. The game feels broken as in some missions where there should be a cutscene there isnt, for expample someone dies who is important and theres no care about it at all its just like oh she died, how are you. Another thing is when the person is talking they always say the same thing like "yeah whatever" and other stuff and it just feels plain lazy.\n\nOne last thing the zombies in this game just feels like its been ripped out of left for dead and retextured and dumped into the game, really dissapointed in this.","July 30, 2014","false","9.6"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","1"

When I first heard there was another third person zombie game coming out, I thought to myself, come on, another one? But the game proved me wrong. I haven't finished the game, so I don't know if it's free roam at the end, but it's free roam during the campaign. The map isn't too large, and it's not too small. It offers a lot of fun and entertainment while playing. I'll make two seperate lists. The Pros, and the Cons. Pros: The game offers a large variety of vehicles to drive and keep at the outpost you're in. The game has a lot of different areas to scavenge for supplies, and especially when you're not doing missions. You can either run, crouch, or sprint to houses and buildings to look for supplies. Taking home rucksacks is a good way to earn influence on the people around you, giving you the chance to take supplies when from where you're storing them. (I'm not going to go into the graphics, but they are good). Gameplay wise, very good. This game makes it even more fun when you bash a zombie's brain in with a baseball bat, hockey stick, golf club, and any other weapon including your character's knee, hands, and the ground is a great way to shove a zombie face first and watch the brains flow out. Cons: The game's map could be larger, and add other features, like snow, and being able to go high up in the mountains and view the map. The game could also be a bit better in gunfighting. The sensitivy on your mouse is a bit laggy when you're aiming a gun. I feel that it shouldn't zoom in so much to your character, and maybe giving a little more room to aim and look around. When being bitten by zombies, you need to constantly tap c on your keyboard to get it off. Sometimes, you even die trying to get it off, even though you shouldn't have. Even thought the game offers a lot, it also has its weak points. Overall the game gets 9/10.","December 14, 2013","true","12.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I am f*cking serious. Seems like developers took all the best from lots of games and made an ultimate zombie survival sandbox. This game reminds me so much of GTA, Left 4 Dead, The Walking Dead, Dead Rising and even the old Jagged Alliance (probably because of team management and it's color spectrum lol)\n\n- open world (area is not that big, but you can enter and scavenge any place or building you want);\n- tons of weapons ranged from melee (from baseball bats and shovels to wakizashi and braid) to heavy guns and grenade launchers etc.;\n- tons of different combat skills and perks, which really bring diversity into a simple fight;\n- random character generation (apart from plot characters);\n- character leveling;\n- plot missions which lead you through the game but are not annoying and you can play them whenever you want (I've played nearly 30 hours until I decided to get through the story);\n- base and team management, building of different facilities for survivors, upgrading them;\n- great soundtrack (COUNTRY ♥♥♥♥ YEAH) and ambient which makes already thick atmosphere even stronger;\n\nAnd of course, dat feel when you slam passing by zombies with your car's side door – OMG 10 out of 10 GOTY\n\nP.S. I didn’t expect this game to be so cool when I first heard of it. Some say (especially the ones who haven’t played it or played on youtube) that it is too casual, arcade and console-like, but it’s not true. This game has great atmosphere which overcomes everything. Seriously, just give it a try. Yes, graphics is not that good, but it is not that important. Plus, the developers have fixed lots of bugs and problems with controls, thank God I didn’t play this game during the early access, it would kill the first impression for sure.\n\nP.P.S. This game does not need multiplayer or co-op of any kind. It would kill all the atmosphere.","December 9, 2013","true","45.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The standard zombies are dangerous in packs, special infected need specific takedown methods (bullet immune, boomer, tank/charger hybrid, stalker), which can encourage you to take the risk and bring a friendly NPC with you (unless its the tank hunt mission in which case it is certain death to the somewhat sluggish NPC character)\n\ngood map setup where after the campaign intro you can move to and fortify one of several base site options, the dlc provides an endless map escalation scenario (campaign map with an escape to make harder function), and a mode focussed on base defence and deep insertion rescue and harvesting missions.\n\nmoving around is kept dangerous, campaign map resources are finite so each reload full of (noisy) bullets is important, damaged mele weapons need to be swapped out for fresh ones before they break so they can be repaired overnight, cars though numerous and powerful can start to become limited later on if you crash to many times or get caught offguard while mowing down a horde.\n\nthe detriment\nI had an issue with the storage box where it would force me ot take the 1st item selected whenever I opened the crate, gear is requisitioned by faction/fame points and taking an item out costa more than putting an item in. the bug lead to rare shortages of fame (when it pulled out a ranged weapon)\n\nThe combat is functional but clunky, the special moves/passives earned by capping player traits help but the basic mele and gun combat lacks depth. distractions, firebombs, grenades, etc help but\n\nLack of sneak options. Later on with a capable/levelled survivor I could manage a horde or 2 horde with manageable risk and careful use of a moltov, there were few opportunities where stealth felt like an option. quietly foraging a house in the middle of an infected area is one thing but every new house seemed to have 3-5 zombies you had to take out in the process, being quiet only prevents a roaming herd from getting in on the action (which tends to waste a sizeable portion of resouces to handle safely)\n\ncore gameplay is similar to dead island, assassins creed (fixed world, unimaginative mele and satisfying stealth kills) and system shock 2 (there's you and an environment and the aggressive hordes out for your blood, resources are limited and you need to get stuff done)","December 18, 2014","true","47.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The standard zombies are dangerous in packs, special infected need specific takedown methods (bullet immune, boomer, tank/charger hybrid, stalker), which can encourage you to take the risk and bring a friendly NPC with you (unless its the tank hunt mission in which case it is certain death to the somewhat sluggish NPC character)\n\ngood map setup where after the campaign intro you can move to and fortify one of several base site options, the dlc provides an endless map escalation scenario (campaign map with an escape to make harder function), and a mode focussed on base defence and deep insertion rescue and harvesting missions.\n\nmoving around is kept dangerous, campaign map resources are finite so each reload full of (noisy) bullets is important, damaged mele weapons need to be swapped out for fresh ones before they break so they can be repaired overnight, cars though numerous and powerful can start to become limited later on if you crash to many times or get caught offguard while mowing down a horde.\n\nthe detriment\nI had an issue with the storage box where it would force me ot take the 1st item selected whenever I opened the crate, gear is requisitioned by faction/fame points and taking an item out costa more than putting an item in. the bug lead to rare shortages of fame (when it pulled out a ranged weapon)\n\nThe combat is functional but clunky, the special moves/passives earned by capping player traits help but the basic mele and gun combat lacks depth. distractions, firebombs, grenades, etc help but\n\nLack of sneak options. Later on with a capable/levelled survivor I could manage a horde or 2 horde with manageable risk and careful use of a moltov, there were few opportunities where stealth felt like an option. quietly foraging a house in the middle of an infected area is one thing but every new house seemed to have 3-5 zombies you had to take out in the process, being quiet only prevents a roaming herd from getting in on the action (which tends to waste a sizeable portion of resouces to handle safely)\n\ncore gameplay is similar to dead island, assassins creed (fixed world, unimaginative mele and satisfying stealth kills) and system shock 2 (there's you and an environment and the aggressive hordes out for your blood, resources are limited and you need to get stuff done)","December 18, 2014","true","47.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You control one character at a time but can switch freely between the other members of your community.\n\nEasily worth the price of the Steam Sale.  The expansions are stand-alone scenarios so if you are wary about buying the game then you can just start with the base.\n\nThe only negative points I'd give it are for technical issues.

However, it is not a great game by any means.\n\nPROS\n1. I love the open world sandbox feel, it actually made me care about how I managed resources and people.\n2. Base customisation is obviously awesome\n3. Each character has a little difference, and in some cases you actually go out of your way to help certain characters. (My anime loving soldier)\n4. The deaths, it seems like a weird point, but they're imaginative and funny (In a really morbid way).\n5. It's singleplayer. This is really strange, but in my opinion it was nice to find a zombie survival game with an indie background that wasn't just a multiplayer deathmatch.\n6. The loot randomisation is quirky and silly.\n\nCONS\n\n1. In my opinion lifeline sucked. I thought it was practically the exact same thing but with more escort missions and searching.\n2. Zombie hordes don't really seem that threatening unless you run into one with no weapons, and even then you can usually run to the nearest car\n3. I thought it was too easy to find high end weapons such as the M27 IAR or the UMP45. I thought it should have been; pistols, shotguns, hunting rifles, and the occasional "weak" SMG, such as the Uzi.\n4. There isn't much to do after you've secured a town with outposts, it would be nice if the spawn rate increased with the outposts and they launched more attacks on your base with more specilised zombies, such as the Juggernauts. This is stealing a page from Lifeline (Which I explained I did not like) but that was one of the only impressive features about the entire thing.","June 25, 2014","true","122.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game however has certain elements to it that are different to any other zombie game I have played. In other games you usually start off with a large group of people with guns and you blast your way through the hordes of zombies that apparantly always know where you are but State of Decay is a different matter all together. Your first weapon is a simple branch you picked up off the ground and you have to use it as best you can to beat some skulls in, the animations for this is very well done and the finishing moves sends the zombies head into the sky. But if your not in the mood to kill or your branch has broken, you can just crouch down, move through the bushes and the zombies won't even know your there which is also good for sneak attacks for an easy kill.\nI highly recommend this game to anyone who loves survival games or just enjoy the feeling of beating in skulls with a variety of blunt weapons","June 29, 2014","true","9.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Why? I hear you ask. To put it simply none of the other zombie survival games I have played quite give you the same apocalyptic atmosphere. In state of decay you really are outnumbered and are constantly surrounded by a feeling of impending doom. Survivors are thinly spread out so when you do come across them its a battle to keep everyone together. Death comes swiftly for the unwary and the zombies vary from slow to fast. They also pick up on any noise you make very easily making it truly scary if you accidently smash or hit something near a building full of the things. Rest assured they will waste no time pouring out and homing in on you. Fortunately there are vehicles dotted around which really can be life savers when you are cornered. Its not always possible to outrun a horde once you get spotted. You either have to try and find somewhere they can't reach or literally fight for your life. Also being in a vehicle just buys you time as the hordes in this game are more than capable of trashing your ride including ripping off doors! The map is fairly big with a ton of buildings to explore. Some just contain zombies while other may have useful gear, other survivors or can be turned into a base. The game does have a day / night cycle and believe me when I tell you its not a good idea to be lost in the woods just as darkness falls. You can hear the zombies but you can't see them. Terrifying stuff.\nEach survivor has their own story and personality. They won't sit around idle either and each day they will do something.\nThe graphics aren't too bad but the controls and interface can be a bit of pain at times. The game does have flaws but they are minor and in no way break the game.\n\nI give this game 8/10 but only because of the minor faults.

Does it have it's issues?  Of course it does, just like every other game in existance.  Little things you'd change if you were in charge.  However, with easily the friendliest, most helpful and involved player community I've ever encountered, you can get a mod to make just about any tweak you can imagine.  The game has all the elements you'd expect from the genre  - thrills and chills - action - scavenging -  a bit of base building - and plenty of those moments where you're left panting with a huge grin on your face asking yourself the question, "Holy crap!  Did I really just survive that!?!"  Breakdown is basically a replay of the main game, without most of the story, but with increasingly difficult parameters.  You'd think doing the same thing over and over again would get boring.  It doesn't.  At least not for me.  I've got many hours logged on this game so far, and I've never even tried Lifeline yet, although I've owned it for months.  I'm still just so engaged with the Breakdown challange.  You can't beat the price on this game, and after playing it for a bit, I'm sure you'll feel, just as I did, that it's easily among the best bargains I've ever received through Steam.  You honestly can't go wrong with this game.","January 17, 2015","true","327.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You spend your time building a community of survivors, managing resources, fortifying your hide-out and dealing with the groups interpersonal conflicts.

The plot is bare-bones, you make your own emergent stories as you move around the world, having good and bad days, developing an XCom-like attachment to your characters because of the games permadeath system.

The game without the DLC is a basic campaign/story mode where you control a group of survivors.   The point is escaping the town you are in, but to do that you have to recruit more surivors, scavange for supplies, and survive long enough.   You setup a home base in one of the many locations throughout the city (Warehouse is the best South/West of map in town) and build things in your base like medical labs, sleeping bunks for extra people, storage, machine shops, etc.     The game also has RPG elements, each person has skills they can level up on a scale of 1-8, and you can pick a offensive and sometimes a defensive skill to specialize in.\n\nBreakdown (DLC)\nWhile some people think this is a dumb idea, it's actually very entertaining.  The problem with the regular game is that after you get to the end of the campaign the zombies don't really get harder.   Breakdown is like the Walking dead, it goes on endlessly until you die.   Rather than escaping the town, you get to the RV and leave and restart the town with the difficulty level increased.   Each difficulty level provides new challengers/achievements you'll want to get, which unlock survivors from the story line.\n\nLineline (DLC)\nThis steps up the action significantly as you control the military after the events of the campaign inside the actual big city.  Sometimes this DLC frustraits people.   You  have a threat level of 1 - 3, when it goes to 3 zombies will attack your military base and you have to fend them off like any defense/wave type game.   What gets people mad is that they feel you don't have enough time to scavange / loot / complete quests before the threat level gets to 3.   The solution so this is to assign your men to "thin the herd" which will delay the increase in threat levels and give you enough time.   You can do this through the base overview section in your options.\n\nThis game does have bugs and glitches, none that I found were game breaking, they actually make me laugh so hard I usually end up dying from it.   You can be driving a car with a flat tire and just get lauched staight up into the air for example :)  Always funny.   The glitches are few and far between and definitely don't ruin the game.\n\nIf you like zombie survival games and you haven't played this one you should already be buying it!\n\nOh, and on bugs/glitches.  I did mention it has some bugs, but it doesn't have 1,000,000 like the Standalone version of dayz.\n","February 2, 2015","true","246.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Same as many George A Romero zombie movies, zombie outbreak happens in rural town, military contains it, military mistake. It's fairly disappointing as to what it could've been and the characters, well the characters just aren't good. They are all really bland and the voice acting is weak\n\nSound design is pretty decent although definitely not a good soundtrack at all, It's not terrible but it's not great.\n\nGraphics are rather decent but I think it could be better, but coming from a indie xbox title, it's good enough for this game.\n\nPros\n+ Realism make this game playable\n+ Gameplay is good enough to playthrough does its job\n+ George A Romero inspired for sure\n+ Special Infected and certain things make the game harder\n+ The loudness design works well because if you alert zombies, or worse off hordes, you will have trouble\n+ Does feel like a survival\n+ Once characters die, they dead for good\n\nCons\n- Very simplistic story\n- Simplistic setting\n- Characters are blank robots\n- The world is dull\n- Missions are repetitve\n- World is huge and gets incredibly repetitive to travel around\n- Gets repetitive\n\nOverall it's a 7.4/10, it's decent enough to be fun, realism makes it interesting and the overall design mkaes it better, I'd suggest getting this at a low price if you want to waste some time and enjoy some Zombie R&R","December 29, 2014","true","28.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/caleblives/recommended/241540/","caleblives","Lead Shacks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/caleblives/","255 products in account","Probably one of the best Zombie games put out in the last few years.\nThe best way to describe this really is It's San Andreas with zombies, an easy, lesser focus on maintaing your base/resource management and some decent writing. Just don't expect TellTale's The Walking Dead here, as while it's not a game with a tongue in cheek tone, it's not exactly the most serious game in town. Think Dead Island at face value but a tad more serious.\nIt's a bit of a rough game, it's not exactly the prettiest looking, the controls may feel a little wonky at first, but if you're up for a game about scavenging through areas infested with zombies, dealing with problems within your group, and every once and a while having some emergent moments like watching in horror as a runner gets litterally torn in half captain rhodes day of the dead style in the middle of the street after getting surrounded and downed by a horde.\n\nThe melee combat is a bit like a stripped down superpower-less Arkham Asylum that makes fighting hordes feel just as difficult and tiring as it reasonably should. While guns are by nature as much of a liability as they are a reward, the gunplay's fine, it's just that the crosshair is a bit too large to be reliable on higher resolutions for which i'd REALLY reccomend the Widescreen Crosshair Fix mod found here: http://www.nexusmods.com/stateofdecay/mods/15/? . Cars are similarily very useful and a bit of a risk, although they are the best way to get around the map, the game does throw some roadblocks every once and a while on roads to make driving a bit more difficult, although you can use mods to remove those if they annoy you.\n\nThere are a few mechanics that might "tick you off" a bit if you have seething hatred for them and so I'll list them below:\n-Character Permadeath, if a character dies/Goes down three times, they're dead. No getting them back. Even story relevant characters can die but it will never make the game unbeatable.\n\n-A persistent World aspect a bit like Animal Crossing although don't worry, you won't not play for a week to find everything in shambles. The longer you're not playing, the slower time moves and if I recall it caps at 3 hours.\n\n-A level of repetition very late into the game, and light annoyance at times. I've seen the game be criticized for this, but at some point parts of the tasks might start to feel a bit repetitive, but this is mostly stuff related to scavenging necessary items and helping characters through emotional states.\nThe annoyance part I mentioned relates to stuff like having to deal with stuff rather constantly, there will very rarely be a moment that something won't need to be done for someone or around the safehouse. Someone might need saving(Outposts reduce the chances of this happening, increasing the area zombies won't spawn in.), someone might need help with their anxiety (Which always results in you killing zombies with them. It's a bit lazy and repetitive but with the amount of ♥♥♥♥ in this game already I can forgive it.), there's story missions to do all while you're trying to keep the safehouse running, everyone healthy and also trying to make towards your next goal and trying not to screw yourself further down the line.\n\nThe story itself is nothing special really, but it is written competently and while not every character feels like more than just an NPC, it does it's job fleshing most of them out. I can't think of a main character I could really call "bland and lifeless".\n\nOne last thing, but this game isn't amazingly well optimized for lower end systems. You should be fine if you have a moderate or high end rig, but if your computer lands more on the "toaster" end, you probably won't be able to tweak the settings too heavily to save your performance.\n\nHonstly, if something irks you about the game, look through the mods there's probably going to be something there to fix it.\nIf you like zombie games just about at all, or what I described interests you, grab this game.","February 2, 2015","true","48.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You find groups, you build resouces to protect etc as you move through the story.\n\nOn my version for some reason the graphics were set to low, easily adjustable. Not amazingly designed; you'll notice a few graphical flaws here and there but if you catch the game on offer for around 7.49 then you will get your moneys worth. There isn't much of an introduction upon staring a new game and you are thrown straight into it with a journal to read to gain information on who you are, what you were doing up until the apparant zombie apocalypes.\n\nThe controls are pretty simple, nothing strenious i've found. No multiplayer which I found surprising at first but thinking about it; what's the point in paying out for servers when the top dogs are going to be the Left for Dead series and now Dayz for the forseeable future. If Microsoft Studios were realistic about this then possibly a wise move; and a little more investment into the game itself. I think the idea of this is more to game play; the graphics and charactor models themselves are not amazing. In fact if I was being over picky one could say the actual graphics and AI are somewhat terrible.\n\nI'd class it as the sensible soccer of zombie games,  it'll never beat the top dogs like fifa (or in this case left for dead and dayz) but does offer a fun alternative.\n\nWait for the sale.","December 30, 2013","true","1.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I waited impatiently for it to come to the PC after reading about it on the 360 - so I jumped at the chance to play it as soon as it came to Early Access (a perfect use of that system too by the way, the game was perfectly playable and only needed a few months to get keyboard support going and to get it properly optimised)\nAnyway, the game itself is basic but extremely satisfying for the the cost and the fact that is by no means a AAA title. You start out coming back from some hiking trip, there a zombies everywhere, shizzle goes down and you get contacted by some survivors. From there you are pretty much free to raid the towns, camp sites, farms, trailer parks and just about everything else for resoucres to help maintain moral at your base (which you can move around from a church, to houses, a fairground, a warehouse...), make trades with other groups and upgrade your base and make a few helpful trinkets (molotovs, silencers and whatnot)  A minor irritation to me was everyone will speak to you as if you were the same person no matter which survivor you switch to, but it's not that much of a bother as generally you'll build up a preference for one or two of them you'll end up only using anyway! And that's the other thing - you pour time and effort into survivors, build up imaginary details about their lives (They are relativly bland in the ingame story, but give just enough to get a hint of personality in most cases) only to then slip up and be eaten alive - and it's over. Yep, it's perma-death, you're gonna have to find a new favorite because there's no going back when you loose a survivor. And that's it really, the story is decent, may be a little weak if it was AAA but it's not - it's a cheap zombie survival game that most AAA games could only wish to be (I'm looking at you Dead Island!) For the most part graphics are rather nice here on PC, the animations are pretty basic but completly forgivable. The fighting and sneaking mechanics are solid too. It make you fill in most of the story gaps and lets you create your own attachment to the characters as you wish through the threat of losing time and effort put into each person.\nIf you essentially want the closest possible thing to a real "The Walking Dead: The Game" this is it!\n","March 24, 2014","true","40.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

For all the potential this game offers however, it falls a bit short of perfection due in part to limited optimization for PC, minor design flaws and a hundred little moments that will have you doing /facepalm.\n\nThe primary features like base building & upkeep, character progression and the constant need to scavenge while fending off hordes are highly engaging.  The dynamic mission system, the relationship system for playable and NPC survivors and the decent pacing of the story guarantee that you'll always have more to do than time to do it in.  Decisions like 24/7 near-real time progression and permanent character deaths enhance immersion and tension.\n\nGameplay goes back and forth between pursuit of the main quest line and addressing challenges to your (and others) survival.  Smart choices and hustle are rewarded with a secure base and (relatively speaking) happy community while poor ones are compounded by a variety of repercussions.  Combat is fun once you develop skills enough to unlock handy special abilities and acquire some slightly higher quality weaponry.\n\nState of Decay is a PC port, and in short it feels and looks like what it is.  The combination of features here is awesome but I'm left wanting more depth, quality and variety in them.  They should also do a careful pass of the experience from start to finish for convenience and user interface.  I'd also like to see a more robust story, more unique survivors with their own side quests, a vast improvement of zombie AI/pathing and an effort to balance special zombies a bit more.  In other words, bring all of the people and zombies to life more convincingly.\n\nThis game is destined to divide players into:\n1) A hardcore group who want a higher level of difficulty and realism and,\n2) A more general group of zombie and RPG fans who get riled up over that first death and the coming to grips with permanent loss of a useful character (who you're emotionally attached to, to boot).\n\nI highly recommend State of Decay to any genre fan.  Temper your expectations reasonably and you will be thrilled with this fun game; I loved it.  I have not yet tried the Breakdown or Lifeline DLC's but reportedly the former provides a satisfying level of difficulty from the getgo and in the end a serious challenge.  Any sequel to this has huge potential and I will be keeping an eye on the future developments by Undead Labs.  Any successor needs a Cooperative mode.  Demands it.\n\n\nTIP: Don't let yourself feel safe or secure, because this game has a nasty way of either suddenly hitting you with a new mechanic or simply bugging out and getting you killed with some form of glitch.\nTIP: Cultivate more than one survivor so that when your starter gets tired or dies you have solid options to fall back on.\nTIP: Respect the Juggernaut, he needs his personal space.  Do not let your friendlies anywhere near that big ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\nTIP: Don't restart if you die, just take the hit and keep on truckin'.","July 5, 2014","true","34.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

There are a couple of issues that hold it back from being 5/5 for me. But I still really enjoyed it.\n\nFirst of all, the game doesn't look great. Partly because its slightly older, but also because its lower budget. With ultra settings the screen can be oddly hard to read sometimes, like there is too much texture that is too pixelated. Overall, the game passes when it comes to visuals\n\nBase building felt lacking to me. I had a lot of fun scouting the city, bringing in new survivors, and then sending them out to scavenge buildings. The problem I had is that each base has a set number of building slots. Even the trucking co yard can only allow 4 tents outside while there is tons of extra room. Its unfortunate because I was really interested in building up a large fully upgraded base but this is actually impossible.\n\nThe cars are problematic too. The handling is atrociously bad. That being said, it really raises the question why DayZ (still in Alpha at this time) still doesn't have cars.\n\nBut problems aside, the game is really FUN! This isn't Dayz, this isn't 7 days to die, this isn't TellTale's the Walking Dead. Yet, it feels close to the TV show the Walking Dead. You manage a large group of survivors, switching between nearly any of them at any time. They can level up, trade gear around, etc. Its a really fun way of managing a population of people during the Apocalypse. The combat is fun too, its simple but clearly takes skill. Shooting is challenging as you really need head shots which makes guns like the AK47 somewhat useless. The shotgun based off of a Remington wins here hands down.\n\nThe story isn't half bad either, although not completely developed. Overall, I had a lot of fun with this game its usually a reasonable price. Its just single player but its really enjoyable.","December 18, 2014","true","13.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You spend your time building a community of survivors, managing resources, fortifying your hide-out and dealing with the groups interpersonal conflicts. Though it plays more akin to Dead Rising than DayZ the main draw of this game is exploring an immersive open-world, having to trek further and further each day to gather resources, deciding whether to drop your plans at a moments notice because someone on your radio is in trouble. The plot is bare-bones, you make your own emergent stories as you move around the world, having good and bad days, developing an XCom-like attachment to your characters because of the games permadeath system. Get past it's jankier elements in the early-game then it is a compelling experience and a lot of fun. Well worth a try.","December 18, 2014","true","45.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The gameplay was just not for me, but the more time I have spent with this game the more I am loving it.\n\nIts like that annoying friend that you love yet want to strangle at the same time, What I mean by that is the survial aspect of this game is wonderful. And the gameplay ended up opening up past what I saw in my first play through. While other zombie games focus more on the killing or maybe the looting this game focuses on a group dynamic. It will make you consider putting your character in danger in order to bring back supplies for a sick group member, or maybe searching a market for more food to feed the group, buy doing so putting yourself at risk to being torn apart and having your character being gone for good. Yes there is perma death meaning if you level up a character and make one mistake they are gone forever all that time you invested in them gone in a blink of an eye. It really changes your mentality on how you go about day to day things in this game, Not only are you wanting to put yourself at risk to better your group but by doing so you risk your own character and these struggles really start getting to you.\n\nYou can of course ease the struggle buy leveling your character, traveling with a partner which will cost influnce or calling in favors like back up from a swat team or you can set up outpost to protect them more allowing them a better chance at survial on supply runs they will make.\n\nThis game does have some glitches and bugs let me be clear I am by no means gonna say it doesnt this is not a perfect game by the hardware standpoint but for me none of them are game breaking or really upset me annoying yes and that is what I ment by that friend you want to strangle, but by no means are they bad enough for me to rage out and want to never play again. Not once did a bug hinder my ability to play the game or did it effect a mission for me up to this point.\n\nThis game is a wonderful refreshing take on zombie survial and at the end of the day that is what this game is and survial game where you try your best to hold out as long as possible with what you can scavenge or with the people you meet its not all that spectacular in the terms of story but at the heart of it you have a real to earth hardcore zombie survial game and that is all it claims to be and it delivers with great gameplay and new take on the genre that I really enjoyed.","September 12, 2014","true","15.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Blood everywhere.\n-While driving, you can open your door as a 'door attack'. Hilarity and bloodsplatters.\n-Stealth kills and sneaking away from hoardes: intense\n-Loot all the things!\n-An abundance of missions in a fairly expansive world\n-Build-A-Base mechanic makes your survival a changeable experience\n-Don't die! Hardcore lives. You die, you can't come back. Only play as another character. The autosave feature enhances this, as you can't just go and select a save file. Be safe out there.\n\nThe game, in my opinion, is fantastic. I've had so much fun in the short time I've played it, and it looks like I have a way to go.\n\nThere are a few problems, though, but not any that ruin anything.\n-Small glitches in fighting, grounded zombie can suddenly stand up and attack you from behind\n-Some repitition (though wouldn't surviving like this be repetitive?)\n-Dialog repeating (can get annoying)\n-Very easy sometimes. The difficulty should be toggleable, as right now some 'hard'-type missions can be done easily.\n\nIf you're on edge about getting this game, I nudge you towards buying it. This game is full of moments, which is something I look for. Sometimes you'll be barely sneaking back to your base through zombies, other times you'll be driving down the road in a rusted up pickup truck, opening your doors to whack a couple of hitchiking zombies. Absolutely marvelous as far as zombie games go.","June 3, 2014","true","9.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Luckily the dlc are a good bargain for their money add that extra fun to keep you playing.\n\nThe bad pc optimization which forces me to play on low settings with a very good rig, the awful campaign which takes way too little time and isn't worked out and the sad fact that there is sadly no random gen which makes replay kinda dull since you end up in the same places ruin the fun a bit.\n\n7/10 definitely worth to buy,you get what you pay for and Good and cheap dlc.","August 13, 2014","true","17.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It starts out with a pretty unique atmosphere and interesting challenges.  The characters though are mostly not memorable except for their names.\nAs you progress through the main story, you kill a lot of zombies.  I'm talking in the thousands!  For a small country town setting it doesnt make much sense.  Personally It got boring to me after a while.\n\nAfter a little break before the final missions, I came back to it because it was interesting enough still just to see what happens in the end.\n\nI would have much rather seen a lower yet more dangerous Zombie population instead of the infinite amount literally all over the map. In the end though its fun and worth the money especially if on sale.\n\nI recommend this for zombie fans and if you like open world games.\n7/10","November 8, 2014","true","43.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This isn't a standard "Left for dead" or even "Dead Island." you have to upkeep your home base as well as expanding. You can take over other areas. You have to keep your team's morale up.

You found guns but never wanted to use them because all you have is 6 shots in the entire game. This game you have to manage resources as well.

The graphics are decent to play.\n\nThe character control is alright. Clunky at times but you get used to it after a while.\n\nThe devs said when it was going to be released on xbox it would have coop but they dropped it and that for me it's a let down and actually makes the game less fun.\n\nThe gameplay is good, do not get me wrong. If you like driving around, killing zombies, building mini forts kinda (barricading windows) and getting supplies then this game is for you.\n\n\nAt the moment at certain parts you'll notice a major lag and the resume. Reason being it is a console port. It has been ported to pc and the devs did say that.\n\nIf the game had coop it would be so much more fun but if you like playing alone, by all means go and play.\nIt is a good fun zombie killing game single player that you can play for a few hours befor getting bored.","November 6, 2013","true","4.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It was a steal for this price.\n\nI was blown away from the Survivor/Zombie AI and all the things you can do in State of Decay which is really unique and refreshing. The survival aspect is amazing! You can get tired, sick and infected! You have to shoot your buddy in the head if he is infected...duh! cruel but realistic lol :S Ammo, materials, food, medicine and other resources are necessary for survival. You can create outpost in abandoned buildings against zombie hordes and choose your own base which is limited but there are quite a few spots that can be used as base and upgrade it with more buildings. You can let other npc survivors join your base if you earned enough trust.\n\nThe combat system is solid and fun, depending on the characters you can choose different skills and try new things out so you don't really get bored if you are choosing other survivors to play. The world is big and looks quite good. Some cars lying around in the world are driveable. It feels great! A little like GTA if you drive around :D\n\nWhat can I say more. If you want to play an open world without storyline buy the dlc breakdown which is really fun and challenging. The are almost no bugs in the game and the archivements aren't broken which is good!

This is a singleplayer storydriven zombie survival game.  It is a good, fun, if sometimes flawed and frustrating game.  If you want to play something akin Walking Dead in a early Resident Evil/Tombraider console style then get this.\n\nHowever be warned that its far from a polished game.  Some mechanics will have you scratching your head and the graphics are of console quality.  Probably the worst aspect is the story based missions that force you to attempt missions even if you arent ready for them.  Combat is can also be unrewarding and repetitive.\n\nBest bits are the party and base management.  Driving cars into hordes and exploration is fun, while searching & finding loot is the most rewarding aspect of the game.  Probably better than killing the zeds.  In addition to searching buildings and loot equipment and weapons, you can establish outposts and setup bases which can be upgraded which adds to the immersion.\n\nThere is some character customization and they can level in certain perks so that keeps things interesting.  Voice acting and music is also good and the dialogue exchanged between party members is well done.\n\nReplayability is fair through the use of randomized minor missions and party/base events that affect key resources such as food, medicine, ammo, materials, fuel and morale and influence which allow you to do things such as take out different equipment and people.  Of which there are loads of.\n\nAfter my initial reservations Id say this could be a fantastic game in time, esp. if the devs tackle the console-y stuff that remains: poor control system (for PC), inferior graphics and resolution and pace the story missions a little better.\n\nAll in all not my dream game... but not far off.","October 24, 2013","true","578.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Oh, yeah, unlike other zombie 'survival' games like Left 4 Dead or KillingFloor,  it actually makes you fear the zombies and either try to avoid them or just go with your sword/guns blazing. There's a huge amount of missions to do, places to check and zombie infestations to clear. The guns and their ammo are quite rare and just like in real life, guns aren't permanent. Everything that you can use more than once can break, that includes melee weapons and firearms. But of course, you can build a workshop to fix them.

This is what I originally envisioned DayZ(sa) would be like - building outposts, home sites, supporting your community of survivors, meeting other groups of survivors, seemingly never-ending open world.\n\nI understand that this is a single-player game, and so the "supporting your community" and "meeting other groups" is just a bunch of NPCs, but still.\n\nUndead Labs has designed something amazing here!  And it's only going to get better!\n\nI was so dissappointed to discover that DayZ(sa) wasn't much more than a serial-killer-simulator.  I've been murdered so many times, for absolutely nothing (we're talking no gear - a flashlight and a battery is worth sniping over?) that it's amazing anyone gets anything done.  People don't team up?  Or I've just tried the wrong 100+ servers so far, I guess.\n\nAnyways, I am so addicted to this game.\n\nSoD is just a ton-load of fun to play.  Wanna follow the story/missions?  Feel free...  Wanna just roam endlessly and hoard supplies?  That's game too...  Swipe an abandoned car and plow through some zombie hordes, just make sure you don't open your mouth as you turn those zeds into bloody soup!  LOL.\n\nI've barely made it a fraction of the way through the story so far, but I'm taking my time.  Taking advantage of the open-world environment to just build up my home site, and increase my reputation with the group.\n\nI don't even plan on playing the Breakdown DLC until I play through the story at least twice, and there's another DLC in the makings.  Can't wait to see what we get in the next update!  The forums are talking about some awesome enhancements to the game.\n\nUndead Labs is certainly on the right track with this gem of a title...  If they eventually break into the co-op/mmo bracket, they're sure to do amazing things!\n","March 31, 2014","true","64.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This I could actually call a survival game since you have to scavenge for supplies and keep in mind that there are zombies around ready to tear you apart. Oh, yeah, unlike other zombie 'survival' games like Left 4 Dead or KillingFloor,  it actually makes you fear the zombies and either try to avoid them or just go with your sword/guns blazing. There's a huge amount of missions to do, places to check and zombie infestations to clear. The guns and their ammo are quite rare and just like in real life, guns aren't permanent. Everything that you can use more than once can break, that includes melee weapons and firearms. But of course, you can build a workshop to fix them. Probably the only negative thing I can say about this game is that there are actually like eight cars in the whole game, which is rather disappointing.\n9/10","November 30, 2013","true","11.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/imjustgettingstarted/recommended/241540/","imjustgettingstarted","Saunders","http://steamcommunity.com/id/imjustgettingstarted/","315 products in account","State of Decay is thrilling. You're dropped into a zombie infestation and forced to manage your resources and survivors. There are various missions that pop up alongside to main story and if you ignore them your survivors can get injured or die. The zombies are easy enough to deal with, but if you're out on your own and you make too much noise you can find yourself being swarmed by all sides. A few lucky grapples by the zombies can leave you in an undead dogpile, slowly being torn to shreds. Once a character is dead it is gone forever.\n\nThere have been times where I find myself surrounded and being beat down, and after barely knocking them off I stumble towards a car out o breath, zombies running after me and trying to grab me. One bite away from death I get into the car and drive off with several zombies hanging on banging at the doors. I can't remember the last time a game has made my heart race so much. There is so much character development and macro management in this game that you really feel like you're "surviving" rather than adventuring.\n\nNow for the flaws. The game is riddled with bugs. It's annoying to be heading into a dangerous area only to have your partner teleport back to base for an "Angry resident" mission. The zombies often clip through walls and into the floor. Sounds don't always play and cars can get damaged on invisible bumps. But none of the bugs are really gamebreaking and they're easy to shrug off. The resource management part of the game is too simple. There's supposed to be some sort of resource usage where some of your food/ammo/medicine are used up each day, but it seems like I'm always at max resources and the only thing I ever NEED to gather is building supplies for more upgrades at base. Because of this there's always more than enough time to do every side mission and there's no sense of urgency in the game.\n\nA few minor tweaks could make the game so much more difficult and so much more exciting. Side missions should force you to choose between saving a survivor or gathering necessary resources (think XCOM). Outposts should require a person there to be useful (instead of giving resources and killing zombies as an autonomous house), making you trade labor for safety. Resources should decay faster so you actually have to spend time scavenging inbetween or during missions. There are a limited amount of resources on the map but I haven't even come close to depleting them all. Before I moved my base to a new town I still had unsearched houses a two minute walk away.\n\nOverall the mechanics of the game are solid. THe game is enjoyable and exciting. With a few tweaks to make it harder could make it a game of the year. If you're thinking about buying it, buy it. If you'e not, buy it anyway.","November 30, 2013","true","14.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The tutorial felt too rushed and more of a you can hit zombies off you go than here's some more intresting facts. When I made it to the church i went through the story it gives you then I quit so I could come back to it with a fresh mind. When i came back to the game I was slaughtered instantly by a zombie I had no idea existed.

It's hit a zombie till he falls then smash his head off with your special.

Well it's not the worst but don't expect anything outstanding.\n\nI'll give it to them that the Dev's are great but I could not get on with this.

Although it veers strongly from the establish plotline of the State of Emergency series, it manages to stay connected, and even throws out oblique references. For example, the main character of the story mode is black. So was one of the main characters in State of Emergency, and they were both similarly named. Many parallels can be drawn to State of Emergency, such as The Law mission.\n\nHowever, this is where the review becomes negative. I was disappointed at how different the game felt and played from the original. The forumla for the first game worked pretty well, and there wasn't much of a reason to change it. This seems to be a total redesign in the wrong direction.\n\nAlthough open-world, there is now a resource-collecting and base-building sidegame, which adds to the confusion. Most of the additions seem tacked-on, and pointless. Zombies, while a welcome addition, provide nothing more than cannon fodder. Although cops served a similar purpose in the first game, in that game their A.I. was more advanced, and were generally more interesting to fight.\n\nOverall, I can't really recommend this game for State of Emergency fans.

I'm glad someone finally did a decent open-world zombie apocalypse RPG. (Red Dead Redemption's DLC doesnt count, although it was fun) However, the game seems a bit rough around the edges and unpolished.

I'm hoping that will be cleaned up in a patch or something. Overall, its a great game and I can see myself playing this one for hours.\n\nMAIN:\nOk so where to start. This game is everything a single player zombie apocalypse RPG should be, although it is definitely not perfect.

I saw the e. a. tag was gone and it was extremely reduced for the summer sale, so I figured why the hell not.\n\nYou start the game as a guy named Marcus on a fishing trip in the remote wilderness with his buddy, but later you get the option to play as others in your group of survivors.\n\nThere are two aspects to this game, one is the open world run around doing random missions, story missions, collecting supplies and fighting zombies, the other (and what makes this game more than just an open world zombie-smash-fest) is managing your base's supplies and rooms and survivor's morale and trust. The base needs supplies such as food, ammo and medicine, which you can only get from raiding places. You can also build different areas inside your base, and upgrade them. Also, you can turn various outside areas into outposts which help you with the supplies, create safe zones, and set traps. Your survivors can go off on their own too, so you may have to rescue them. Random events happen, that can make survivors angry, or happy. The more stuff you bring back, the more you can ask for favors such as friends following you, radioing for certain supply caches, taking stuff out of the supply crate and so on (the mechanic in the game is your "reputation points").\n\nPersonally, I think it sucks that even if you were the one who braved the zombie hordes to bring back gear, once you put it in the base's supply chest, it costs MORE rep points to pull it out then you earned putting it in. I understand why the devs did it from a gameplay standpoint, but it only makes me want to put items I am probably not going to need in there.\n\nTheres a LOT of stuff to do, just running around causes you to get random radio requests from your base. Things like clearing an infested house, helping a survivor (both strangers and ones in your group), hunting a dangerous type of zombie, raiding a certain building and many more. Helping people builds up trust, morale, and rep points, while ignoring requests for a certain amount of real-world time can fail the mission with negative consequences.\n\nThats another interesting fact. The game is run off of a real world timer. So say a character gets "hurt" (worse than just injured, their health permanently goes down until they rest and heal) or tired (max stamina goes down), you have to take them back to base and let them rest. Also, the in-game clock and date is the first day you start. So say you started playing on June 9th. Your diary would start that day as well.\n\nThe combat is simple to master and very fluid. It feels great to smash zombie heads with a lead pipe or other blunt object. There are various attacks you can do, as well as dodges(absolutely a must to master), finishing moves, and stealth kills. There is also many different types of firearms, with firing being relatively realistic. Not as much as a reality-based FPS army game, but more so then a typical 3rd person shooting game like GTA. The game also tries to be realistic with the sound of a shot drawing a crowd, so except for certain situations, sneaking up and bashing away seems a much better idea. The standard zombies are the running/jumping type for the most part, but generally go down easy as long as you arent swarmed. Not so for some of the rarer types, such as one bloated with poison gas and one that seems to act more like a werewolf.\n\nSound is a major part of the game. As your character walks, a little blue circle surrounds him/her getting bigger or smaller the more or less noise you make. The zombies are attracted to sound, so things like banging around while searching, driving a car (always fun to plow through a horde) and shooting draw them. The zombies also make noise, and it is very important to make sure you dont walk up on one lurching around where you cant see it by listening for the sounds it makes.\n\nSo, whats the bad points? Well. The graphics are glitchy as all hell for starters. Expect plently of pop-ins, clipping, disappearing weapons (even though your character still is rendered as if s/he is swinging away with it), enemies suddenly being on top of your car when you go to smash them and so on. The weirdest one I saw so far is a zombie laying down (some lay, then stand up and go after you when you alert them). I walked up and was about 5 feet away, and instead of getting to his feet, the zombie model laying on the ground did a jittery complete horizontal 360, and then suddenly disappeared, then popped-in standing and right in my character's face, where he bit me. Fun.\n\nAnother is it doesnt seem to be optimized very well. It jacks my core temp up by 20c or so no matter what graphics setting its on. And its not pushing my gpu/cpu very hard at all. Its not a big deal, though, just smacks of a rushed finish.\nBut even though its a bit glitchy and has rough edges, its still fun as hell. Anyone whose an RPG and zombie apocalypse fan should check this out.","June 29, 2014","true","269.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I quit the game after 25 minutes, but after a few days I picked it out of my steam library to give it another shot. I don't regret that in the slightest.\n\nThere is no main character really. You're going to be swapping through characters very often. There is a story and a plot but it's somehwat minor. It doesn't tell the details from just one characters perspective, and many dynamic set of characters cause the game to focus on the plot of other people around you, such as the various factions you can help or hinder, rather than the set of characters that you can have on your team.\n\nYou might dislike the same voice acting from several characters, but their lines were voiced very well and it didn't bother me. The cast seems to have a unique design for the set of characters save for the voice acting.\n\nIf Microsoft invested a bit more money to give it more polish, it could have recieved universal acclaim.","November 16, 2014","true","24.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Morboth/recommended/241540/","Morboth","Morboth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Morboth/","431 products in account","State of Decay is, without doubt, the ultimate zombie experience.\n\nYou start the game with a pair of survivors and you get more as you advance through the game. You can switch between them with ease and at will, there's no main character here. There's also permadeath, so whenever a survivor falls to the zombie hordes you keep playing... as one of the other survivors, therefore losing the game whenever your whole group gets eradicated.\n\nThen, there's the resource factor: you need to gather food, ammo, construction materials, medicine and fuel in order to keep your base up and running - yes, you have a base, and you can settle in other places if you feel like those might turn out better - , so you spend a lot of time doing scavenging and looting all over Trumbull County: houses, drugstores, grocery stores, mini marts, offices, warehouses, factories and so on and so forth, are all ripe for the looting. Aside from the aforementioned resources you obviously get also some handy items, such as weapons, medicine for yourself, food to recover stamina and some other miscellaneous items, such as cooking clocks and fireworks, to attract zombies to some location. I would like to add that all of these, both resources and items, are FINITE. So you would do well in progressing through the storyline every now and then.\n\nTrue to the game's spirit, vehicles are, while not in short supply, not infinite. That alone is an extra incentive to get your smoldering vehicle to your base, so as to give it some needed repairs.\n\nFinally, the only downside to the game is that the game world keeps going on even when you are not playing. So it may be that if you don't check on your survivors every now and then you may find upon returning that some have left the base due to lack of resources, while others might be in a hurry, being ovverrun by zombies... and others downright dead. Therefore, my advice is for you to check on the game on a daily basis until you accomplish whatever goal you have in mind, be it the storyline or some other.\n\nOn the technical side, graphics are alright, but the framerate is not what you'd expect. Getting the game on Ultra settings takes its toll on my rig when I'm in the city, and I have a GeForce 660 GTX, which runs Battlefield 4 as smooth as silk on high. Voice acting and sound is downright lacklustre. The AI is OK, both for other survivors and zombies. They may bump into minor obstacles every now and then and may show some inconsistencies when in a fight, but nothing big here.\n\nAll in all, this is a 8.5 for me, it's deeply immersive and a must buy for any zombie and sandbox games lovers out there. The only cons I can think of is the 'still running when you are not playing-world' and the framerate.\n\n\nREVIEW UPDATE:\n\nHaving played both Breakdown and Lifeline, and especially that god-sent update that lets you store stuff in the boot of your car, I must say this game has improved, and by that I mean a LOT: while Breakdown does not offer much in terms of replayability, being essentially the same wave after wave, Lifeline does truly revamp the experience.  It is an absolutely different take on the State of Decay formula, where scavenging and lone survival make way for relentless zombie action on a scale you've never seen or fathomed, as you fend off wave after wave of Ferals and Juggernauts using a vast array of military-grade equipment, such as state of the art weaponry, drone strikes, air strikes and whatnot. Also, while I cannot confirm this, I do believe that Lifeline does not keep going while you're not playing, as vanilla did, which is an excellent change. Only qualms I may have with Lifeline is not being to explore the more urban part of the city depicted.\n\nWith the addition of the fabulous Lifeline DLC - and even Breakdown is kinda enjoyable for a while - and the car storage, I would safely give the game a 9/10. Zombie games just don't get any better than this.","November 27, 2013","true","90.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The biggest issues I have are related to game mechanics that waste the player's time:\n\nIf you have to quit the game in the middle of a mission, when you reload your save you will end up back at your base.  For missions with a time limit, this likely means you will fail because A) you can't get back out to the location and finish it before time is up, and B) something else will come up to prevent you from getting back out there, like another damn horde attack as soon as you load your game.\n\nGood luck taking care of a horde attack early in the game.  Gunfire just attracts MORE zombies, and melee weapons break too fast to do much good.  Zombies scale walls instantly even if barbed wire is on top, and barriers on doors and windows DISAPPEAR after an attack.  This makes reinforcement useless and stupid.\n","February 25, 2014","false","2.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Virtually all of the cars are the same. Maybe 2 skins each on 5 types of cars. Leaving about 10 total different vehicles.

I'd take this over DayZ anyday!\n\n\nState of Decay is basically at its core is a single player, third person 'Zombie Survival' action game, with sim like management elements.\n\nWhen you start off you're in control of one guy who, with his chum, gets lost while hiking. If, by some miracle you dont die, you'll never see the more interesting mechanics of 'State of Decay', which is that when you die, you take control of a different character instead. You dont respawn. This makes choices matter a whole lot more than in most games, as you always have something to lose when going out to get supplies with a band of survivers.\n\nYou also have to manage the survivers health, morale, supplies (and inherantly, the shortages that will occur) and generally look after them. Characters will get tired over time, and you'll have to swap out the playable character for a bit while they regain thier energy.\nThis brings me to one of the games more annoying mechanics. Even when you're not there, the game world is still moving, albiet at a slower pace. Survivors can die, run away, starve, and generally things can go bad fast when you arn't there. While it's a cool idea, I found it just became annoying to patch up the band of survivors, turn off the game, only to find that someone had been killed off when I came back.\n\nGameplay:\nControls are reasonably responsive. Sometime it feels a little sluggish and the jumping mechanics are a little floaty, but it's all servisable, and doesn't impact the game a whole lot. You have the options of melee weapons, or guns when dealing with the undead.\nCombat is passable; nothing more. You'll find yourself spamming the attack button as your character losing stamina while the zombie you're wailing on continues to suck the durability from your weapon.\n\nThe game really punishes you (which I love!) for trying to take on large groups of Zombies, as you'll find you'll be quickly overwelmed.\nGuns are also an option, but are loud, crude and are in limited supply. Usually a last resort unless you have a silencer.\n\n\nIn conclusion: One of the better surval sim games out there.","November 29, 2014","true","14.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

However, I wouldn't call it perfection. In fact, this game has plenty of flaws.\n\nIn the graphics section, I found it to be pretty nice for the most part. However, in the beginning of the game, the lighting is absolutely terrible and hurt my eyes a bit. Despite that, the visuals were extremely nice and I was itching to take a few nice screenshots. However, I can't call it the #1 best part. It's still very well done.\n\nThe gameplay is heated, difficult, and in some ways, realistic. The gameplay is probably the best part to the game. When you think of zombie games, I assume that you would imagine some dude with a six-pack running around shirtless with shades on dual wielding sub-machine guns, right? State of Decay is NOT like that. These are just human beings we're talking about, not supersoldiers. In fact, if there's anyone people would consider cheap in this game, it would be the Army. But hey, we're talking about the Army here. Did you really think a soldier would be running around and getting tired quick and having a miserable aim? Anyway, running away from hordes IS NOT a good idea. I've tried to run several times, but I've only gotten out alive once or twice. The people who did survive had severe injuries, were extremely tired, or have no useful items left on them. The vehicles are simple enough to drive, and making them limited just makes the game even harder. Very good gameplay.\n\nThe story is cliche, no doubt. Survivors are holed up in a certian place (In State of Decay, Trumbull County) and the Army refuses to help. However, it seems rather difficult to actually come up with a decent plot for a zombie survival game without realizing someone else did that already.\n\nThe audio is above average at most. The voice acting is fine, at times weak. It sometimes sounds sarcastic or the mic is far away. However, some of the actors do provide some emotion. The music is great for a zombie survival game, and I usually rely on the music to tell me if the zeds are nearby. Although again, the music is a bit cliche since several zombie survival games (and even shows) use guitars or things like that for their soundtrack. But, the soundtrack is very good in this game and is better than lots of other games and shows that use the soundtrack like this.\n\nThe replayability is very strong in this game. If you beat the game, you can play through it again once or twice. There's also the two DLC packs that were very critically acclaimed you can buy, too. I didn't get either one yet, but Breakdown looks extremely fun. It's actually number one on my wishlist right now.\n\nState of Decay does have a few other major flaws I'd like to point out: The AI in this game is absolutely HORRIBLE. One of my survivors stood there doing ABSOLUTELY nothing while getting eaten by a horde of zombies. Since my guy was tired, I had to run the zombies over. And because usually the survivors dodge the car, he just stood there, doing absolutely nothing. When I hit him, he stood there and I lost trust with him. It was even one of the trust missions where someone is feeling angry, sad, or whatever. He also took like half an hour to get all of his things while the houses next to him were infested when we rescued him. Still though, BAD AI.

The fighting is usually pretty fun, the base management is simple enough to be enjoyable without overly hindering the rest of the game, scavenging runs feel useful, the vehicles are lots of fun to use--overall, lots of little fun elements working together as a cohesive whole.\n\nInterestingly, while I played and LOVED "Lifeline" (possibly because I am apparently so much better with guns than with melee that I found it surprisingly easy), I think "Breakdown" is about the least compelling possible version of this game, as there is no longer an actual end goal.  With "Breakdown" the game feels more like you are playing a 1980s arcade game to get the highest score, and, well, I think we have moved beyond that as a gaming goal by now, surely?  Ha.  But obviously plenty of people love it, as it sounds like the most fun version of the game for many.  But "run around the base game map and do all the same stuff as the base game, and your reward in the end is to do it all over again on a harder map until you die and lose your save" does not exactly sound appealing to me.\n\nBUT!  This is still a -spectacular- zombie game, and a pretty great game by any standards.","August 31, 2014","true","234.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chaoswin32/recommended/241540/","chaoswin32","Mojyo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chaoswin32/","66 products in account","State of Decay is a SINGLEPLAYER zombie survival game set in the Midwest United States. It involves rounding up smaller bands of human survivors and incorporating them into your 'influencial area', AKA your zombie survival society. While this mechanic is thought out in amazing detail, down to emotions and job distribution, a lot is to be desired for the entire game.\n\nThe first problem I encountered starting gameplay was the somewhat steep learning curve. As the de facto 'leader' of your party, a massive amount of responsibilites are shoved into your arms. And I appreciate that for its realism, of course as a leader of a surviving band of humans in a zombie apocalypse a lot of responsibilites are going to be picked up by you, but in State of Decay the concept is blown out of proportion. Your fellow survivors are utterly inept at taking care of themselves, falling off roofs and demanding to be rescued. Rather than an NPC taking care of the problem while you're out trying to aquire medical supplies, YOU have to go out of the way to save him or else he'll die and everybody will be angry at YOU for not saving him.\nAnother concept that was annoying was the fact you were STUCK with a group of man-children for your survival party. In essence, you had no option to go it alone or become a nomadic survivor. How hard is it to ask for a quiet life in the middle of the woods eating peas and corn out of a can while making the occasional excursion into zombie territory? The main reason why much of my map goes unexplored is because I have to deal with party issues that crop up every twenty seconds or so. I don't want to stop my search for fellow survivors because some idiot back at base slipped and dropped his ice cream.\n\nThis is another nitpick I had to deal with- the survivor-survivor interaction in the game was DISMAL. While other (NPC) bands of survivors eke a living out in the zombie territory, they never come off as hostile to the point where they start targeting you. While this may seem like a good thing, it's actually an extremely narrow-minded concept. Example: "oh, all survivors are good, let's all be friends." More than likely in a disaster scenario everyone would be thinking for themselves, take Hurricane Katrina for example. Gangs of looters were prevalent in the suburbs, and murder was commonplace before the National Guard locked the place down. While some NPCs may express hatred towards you or your group, they will never take an action against you short of refusing to come on an expedition with you.\n\nSome other parts of the game greatly affected my enjoyment of gameplay, such as the fact that a solid steel crowbar can break if you hit soft flesh enough times. Close-up mechanics are about as robust as Space Station 13. Gunplay is almost depressing, repeated hits to the forehead from a .44 Magnum revolver to an eight-foot tall inbred zombie monstrosity wasn't enough to put it down, let alone shots from a Remington 750. This was during an early mission, and somehow the thing bugs through the window and tears me in half. Driving cars is fun until you run over enough zombies and your car inexplicably EXPLODES, or you hit a pebble in the road and you go flying. Zombies are also able to latch onto your car even as you're driving past them at 50 mph.\n\nHowever the game still had some redeeming qualities. Guns are correctly named for the most part, only the ones with copyright licenses in place had to be changed and some others were just renamed for easier naming. (But really, 'Monag' is the new Mosin Nagant!? Since when is a 100 year old pre-soviet era rifle licensed?)\nVisuals are great, especially when walking down the highway. Just ignore that constantly updating survivor-♥♥♥♥up-o-meter in the top right and relax. Dialogue between survivors is frequent and expressive.\n\nIn the end, this game had a lot going for it, and possibly more in the future, although unlikely. The absence of multiplayer makes playing the game almost a sort of chore. Two heads are better than one, they say. And as of now, there's only one head. This game seemed good, but now it just reeks of wasted potential. The large screen at the start that says "BUY DLC HURR HURR" is really a big sign that shows that the developers really don't care about their players. It's quite sad, really.\n\nI rate State of Decay a 4 out of 10, because there were so many things that could have gone so right that in the end went so wrong. I want my five dollars back.","June 21, 2014","false","2.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

The other issue I had were the rucksacks, which you could only cary one of even if you had a car! This makes material gathering long and tedious. Also a big thing for me was how road signs respawned after you destroyed them, things shouldn't rebuild after you leave the game! I wish that this game was more like its name and you eventually start to worry about the lack of supplies and you need to be careful with cars because their are a finite amount of them. Also I wish you could have attacked other survivors for supplies.

This frequently makes it hard to glance around and get a proper view of things, leaving you open to attack from places that you can't see--places you could easily look if the game would let you turn your head or body.\n\n[Update 2014-10-07: When playing with an Xbox360-compatible controller, there seems to be much more control of the camera angle than with the mouse. This removes my primary irritation with the game.]\n\n[Update 2014-10-12: When playin with controller, shortly after I got two people following me instead of one, the game very frequently popped up a prompt to Taunt/Cheer/Agree/Disagree. Nobody had said anything, so the last two don't even apply! The buttons to answer the prompt are the same as buttons you need to do melée, finishing strokes, searches, open/close doors. This means that I randomly was unabled to attack, defend, or close a door in time. Sometimes I could work around it be quickly pausing, unpausing, and immediately pressing the desired key before the Taunt/Cheer/Agree/Disagree prompt got in the way again.]\n\nYou can control many different characters and improve their skills, such as with a particular weapon. However, they all seem completely unable to handle themselves without you present, regardless of purported skills. Keep in mind that when you close the game you are not considered present, so the next time you open it you may find that a nice situation has become dire, or that a desperate one has already been turned into failure.\n\nThis is not a game you can play "from time to time", but rather one that requires you to frequently come back to make sure that things haven't collapsed while you weren't playing. And if you have to exit the game during an in-game crisis to deal with real life, you may have to do a lot of rebuilding, healing, and recruiting of new characters when you return. You may even have to start over.\n\n[More Update 2014-10-07: Although they did eat all the food and use all the other supplies in the months that I left this title alone (and the window barricades mysteriously disappeared without the window glass being broken), nobody died--not even the one supposedly in critical condition.

The main story of SoD is decent but nothing amazing. Don't buy this game if you're only in it for the storyline. You'll only be left very dissapointed as there isn't much meat on the story. The gameplay on the other hand is what makes this game so addicting and entertaining.\nThe graphics are quite well and there is alot to explore. Ever wanted a zombie game with Sims elements? SoD is what you want. You and your community must survive and gather resources, with small events randomly being triggered around the community and game world. Each new community member that joins you is another someone you can play as. If your character dies you will reappear back at your base as one of your current members. The game itself is only in thirdperson, not that it's an issue, the characters are very detailed and interesting to play as and you almost never feel like playing the same one.\n\nAs for DLC, Breakdown offers alot of new content such as weapons and unlockable hero's, characters from the main storyline and a few bonuses. Breakdown also makes the game less storydriven and more focused on sandbox style. Surviving or doing whatever it is you wish. Breakdown also has a level stage system. You can fix a RV and eventually, if you desire, leave Trumbull Valley only to reappear somewhere randomly in the game again, just on a new, reset game world with your previous survivors. Going an level up, surviving becomes harder in alot of factors. There are less items to be found, more zombies, harder to kill etc.\nIf you've always wanted a zombie sandbox game with minor, sims elements, just in this case, community overall, SoD and Breakdown is defently a must buy for you.","March 1, 2014","true","312.3"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

And an  unecessary remake, to be precise, since the game was released no more than 1,5 years ago.\n\nCertainly, I'd understand such a visual upgrade if the game was a 2000's title, but doing so for a game released in 2013 is preposterous - clearly a quick cash-grab from the owners of the original game if you ask me. Why  Microsoft Studios ? Why?\n\nTo me, unless owners of the game with BOTH DLC's have AT LEAST a -70% discount for this minor upgrade of the game, there is no way I am recommending this, and I'd advise you withhold purchasing  (especially if you already own the game)  because by supporting such moves from developers will only make things worst for  us  gamers...\n\nJust imagine every title, every game out there, after one year of the initial release, coming up with a hypothetical 'remastered' version of the game with slightly better visual quality and an extra 'car' or 'mission' that should be there in the first place and asking for almost the full price of the game AGAIN, from people who ALREADY own the full game. And above all, you are FORCED to buy it since the company no longer cares about the original (older) version, but rather "focuses" on the new one. Trust me, that would be a disaster...\n\nPeople are upset and this shows from the huge drop on the game's ratings (from 94% positive to 89% positive in two days), and the numbers keep dropping...\nHonestly, it pains me, because I used to like State of Decay. Unfortunately it's yet another game that fell in the pitfall of 'greed'.\n\nEDIT: As it turns out, YOSE is out and it is a complete disaster. People claim that they can barely tell the visual quality difference between the "new" and the "old" version and the new 'additions' are MODS at best and some of them already exist on the NEXUS!!\n\nI do NOT recommend it any longer","April 19, 2015","false","69.6"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","9","16","0","0"

Not worth the money even though I got it on sale. Keep looking for a good game and don't trust good reviews, not even totalbiscuit.\n\npc optimization and graphics: Can't max the game at 1080p 60 fps on an overclocked r9 290. Turning the settings down I still see dips below 60 fps. The game also seems to want to lock itself to 50fps at certain points for no reason. The menu screens still have xbox buttons on them. This is the worst console port I have ever played. The worst. They didn't even add anti aliasing, just a quality slider and shadows options and that's it. I had to force AA with radeon pro because catalyst control center doesn't work for this game. The graphics are awful. I'm no professional artist, but I could make a better looking game than this. I would never have the audacity to sell a  product that looks like this. The graphics could have been for the original xbox. Actually, halo 2 looked better. The shadows/shading had to be fixed with mods so I could see during daylight. Tried other mods but held off because I read mods like the sweet Fx ones made the game even more buggy than it already is. The screen shots you see on the store page are BULL SHOTS, and even from the bull shots you can tell the game looks a bit dated. The game doesn't look as good as the store page screen shots  at all. It looks like they downsampled and added better shading or something. Sad how bad steam's quality control on games is.\n\nsoundtrack: Forgettable is all I can say. I can't even hum one song off the top of my head. Once looking up some music on youtube, it was alright and set a decent tone.\n\nstory: Hardly there, and not worth paying attention to any real progression. More of a survival game I guess. ♥♥♥♥ that, I want  a good story driven, open world zombie game. Instead I got this garbage.\n\ngameplay: A little better on this front but still nothing special. The pros include open world with some missions that pop up along side the "main missions" to keep things interesting. However, that's where it ends. The cons are plentiful and make the game worthless even if you are someone who can look past the bad graphics. The management is no fun. The resources are limited with unlimited zombies. Haven't run into the problem of people getting killed off while not even playing the game like some have reported, but I have had to deal with the infuriating save system. The saves are auto save only with no loading previous saves. The inventory system is dumb, with the largest backpack barely holding anything. Looked for a fast travel mod so I could atleast drop stuff off at base and couldn't find one. Half the time I can't even switch to another character or get another character to follow me, and there seems to be no reason.(glitch/bug not a matter of team liking me) As soon as the fact that  its open world wears off, which will be within an hour or two considering how small the world is, you'll just see the game as repetitive: go here, clear area/loot house/ hold off incoming zombies mission over and over. The world sucks to explore. Like really sucks. More shallow than an ubisoft open world game. If you're someone who thought skyrim was shallow, stop reading this review, cancel all thoughts about this game, and do something else. Guns are unsatisfying (probably due to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mouse support) and all feel about the same except for maybe the shotguns having spread and less range. Silencers were poorly implemented and break for no reason after a set number of shots. The decision to include no human enemies with guns was a terrible idea. Look at a game like dead island, which I also thought was pretty bad, but atleast had decent gameplay pacing with the mix between zombie and human enemies. The AI of your team and zombies is horrible and makes the game even more horrible to play.\n\nOverall, this game is bad, even for an indie game. It won't hold your interest if you have some sort of standards for games, even if you are a zombie fanatic.","July 24, 2014","false","7.0"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","12","22","0","0"

From a larger developer, I would be just as angry- but the game's store page has no reference to any incompatibilities it might have had or anything like that. After buying it, and being super psyched to play it after seeing a few let's plays; I downloaded it and waited until everything was done; only to find that when I finally booted the game I was greeted iwht a message 'This game is incompatible with your graphics card, the game was not built to support onboard graphics cards' referencing the model my computer uses. All the while, I can play Skyrim or Xcom on medium settings just fine; but I got to see the menu of the game and if I tried to start a game was greeted with a black screen.\n\nI wouldn't have ended up upset or irritated at the game at all, which now just taunts me in my library view; if I hadn't picked it up and spent 15$ (Thankfully it was on sale) only to end up finding that it's paying that much for a game that functionally works; less than even a coaster. I'm glad the game is successful, but one thing I can only hope of indie developers, especially those who have went past the 'bug-testing stage' of their games; is that they follow the method of Paradox Interactive, and actually give support on these matters. While I want to believe in this game, I've basically been shanked for the belief.","December 9, 2013","false","9.0"," 19 of 36 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","19","36","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stonepaintings/recommended/241540/","stonepaintings","stonepaintings","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stonepaintings/","50 products in account","Standing atop a water tower, the survivor scouts out areas that may contain much needed supplies while also making note of where the nearby zombie activity lies. This is Undead Labs’ “State of Decay,” and day to day life inside the zombie title constantly involves the search for materials to survive. It’s not just about getting the goods necessary for living another day as much as the situations gamers encounter while out scavenging for them.\n\n“State of Decay” may feel like several other tiles. It’s easy for gamers to look at the title and see that it’s an open-world game with vehicles and think it must be like “Grand Theft Auto.” Others may hear that it involves rescuing survivors from a zombie outbreak and think it might be similar to “Dead Rising,” or that the act of searching for supplies in order to outlive the undead must make the game some kind of single-player “DayZ.”\n\nThe truth is, even though “State of Decay” may seem like all of these on paper, it all blends together to create a unique experience that gamers can’t find anywhere else.\n\nThe survivors of Trumbull Valley\n\nPlayers don’t have a single character to control inside “State of Decay.” In order to survive in the safest and most effective way possible, gamers must bring together a community of people. Rather than playing as a single survivor, the player represents an entire group.\n\nAfter earning any character's trust to become their friend, players gain the option to take control of that survivor and thus use them to go out and gather supplies or do missions.\n\nIn Fact, “State of Decay” requires gamers to switch out which survivor they are playing as doing too much on one person will make them fatigued and much more likely to die. Speaking of death, when a character dies it is permanent. That person is forever removed from the group and loading a previous save isn’t an option as “State of Decay’s” auto-save feature ensures that both risk and choice matter in the game.\n\nBasically, gamers should get use to the idea that survivors will die. This is the zombie apocalypse after all.\n\nIt’s the supplies that keep the group alive\n\nTrumbull Valley features a rural setting that includes small town settlements as they would exist today if an uncontrollable zombie outbreak occurred. As such, the landscape is filled with houses, stores, storage sheds, warehouses, and more to scavenge through.\n\nIn addition to finding weapons and other items that are for active use on a character, players must find packs of materials that are necessary for the home base. The group needs food, medicine, and fuel for obvious reasons. Ammunition helps keep the survivors at home alive as it gives them the means to defend themselves while the player is away.\n\nAnother important resource the community requires comes in the form of building materials. These are necessary for the group to make repairs and additions to their home base by building watch towers, sleeping areas, workshops, medical tents, and more.\n\nThe new structures allow the group to improve their base so that it can provide better protection, house more survivors, repair tools and vehicles, treat the injured, and even grow a daily source of food via outdoor gardens.\n\nThere’s no place like Home\n\nSince the home base houses all the survivors together, they will occasionally get in fights with one another. This will prompt players to escort these troubled individuals away from the base so that they can have a private talk in hopes of calming the situation down. Occasionally, members of the group will also end up in distress or turn up missing. Gamers are then tasked to come to their aid and help them back to safety.\n\nTo help everyone out in the field, players may establish outposts away from the home base which provide relative safety while separated from home. Outposts allow missing survivors to find their way back, and create a safe perimeter around the structure which can be expanded by placing traps.\n\nThis land belongs to the dead\n\nThe 16 square kilometer map of “State of Decay” features a couple of small towns, wooded areas, rivers, farms houses complete with fields, and even some lakes. Basically the game’s environments provide all the ingredients for a classic horror setting after scores of the undead are thrown into the mix.\n\nThe living dead themselves are both varied and plentiful. There are standard shambling zombies, which travel either alone and in large wandering hordes that work as a single unit which can easily overwhelm lone survivors.\n\n“State of Decay” also features a few special zombie units that are more of a threat than the average walking corpse. These range from bloated zeds who leave a deadly toxic fume in their wake to armless zombies whose only attack comes in the form of a stunning scream which lets the nearby undead swarm the defenseless survivor.\n\nMost of these special units bear a resemblance to a figure that was once believably human with the exception of the lumbering Juggernaut. This behemoth towers as a giant above the other dead and bears the strength to send cars flying with a single swipe that would suggest that they aren’t merely the reanimated corpse of a deceased human being.\n\nAn enjoyable harmony\n\n‘State of Decay” weaves elements of several genres together to create a new gaming recipe for fun. On their own merits, the game’s combat, resource gathering, survivor micro-management, and other systems are decent. When they are put together, however, they become much greater than the sum of their parts. Everything blends together in such a way that players won’t even care about the game’s few minor issues such as graphical tears, clipping, and framerate dips.\n\nWhen looked at as a full-title, “State of Decay” is remarkable. Considering the fact that this is an Xbox Live Arcade game, the results are phenomenal. This is definitely a must buy for any fan of either zombies or sandbox gaming, but this is the kind of experience that every gamer should at least try.","December 20, 2013","true","51.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It was a good start though, and I hope it inspires a successor.   Pick it up if it's on sale, and you like the genre.\n\nIn the first 20 or so hours of play, I enjoyed the drama and challenge of trying to find survivors and keep them alive.  I also enjoyed relocating my home site, and playing the various storyline missions.    The map is realistic, immersive and desolately beautiful  in it's zombie soaked way.\n\nHowever, after arriving at my final home site, i found that the games mechanics started to become more and more tedious.   I would need to spend lots of time running out to find building materials, which for some reason, I couldn't pile up in the back of my huge pickup truck.   Also, bringing people with you tended to be a waste of time, since they were both too lazy to carry anything, and would often book it home at random.\n(there is a way to trick the game into letting you stack multiple rucksacks in the back of a truck, but it's a kluge)\n\nThe random, and highly repetitive task of trying to keep your survivors happy gets old fast too.\n\nIt can also be a pain in the ♥♥♥ to find the survivor you want to play, why aren't they on the mini map!?\n\nFinally, I think, like may console ports, the control just isn't up to snuff.    The combat has complexity that you can just totally ignore, and I find the combat sloppy and frustratingly random at times.\n\nGetting stuck behind NPCs in houses is also a bit annoying.

A real good pick up and will get you more than 50 hours of playtime so it's pretty cheap... Recommended","December 1, 2013","true","95.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game starts with you returning from a fishing trip with your buddy Ed to find the main land over run with zombies. The game combines third person melee and ranged combat with a scavenging resource and community management system.\n\nThe starting area is fairly easy with sparsely positioned zombies in a camp ground area. You quickly find the rangers station and begin exploring the area and looting for supplies.\n\nThe combat system is fairly competent as is the driving system, however controls for this game currently are restricted to controller but the developer is working on full keyboard and mouse control so keep this in mind before buying this title.\n\nThe graphics are decent enough but nothing spectacular, however this is not a AAA title so this is understandable. Music, ambient sound and voice acting are pretty good considering this is not a AAA title.\n\nWhat makes this game really shine is the community management system. You don't play one main character as you need to manage fatigue and people need to rest, so this has you swapping out for other community members as need be, but you will quickly find your favourites and tend to cycle between them.\n\nThe inventory management system is decent but transfering items between characters is frustrating making you return to base and stash it before switching characters and retrieving the items.\n\nAll in all this is a great game and definitely a refreshing approach to the zombie survival genre and for $20 or equivalent it is worth your time to pick this up. If you enjoy the zombie genre and looking for something a little different then this may be the game you have been looking for.\n","October 31, 2013","true","1.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

From the start it is clear that this game isnt about zombie death count, its about surviving the Zombie apocolopse by gathering resources, befriending the local population and securing the best territory to enable to to live and survive in relative comfort.\n\nFirstly the bad bits about gameplay. there are quite a few bugs, casually looting some food and a zed decides to come through the wall and mall me. luckily only the one! the graphics are in no way next gen, which i kind of like in a way, it gives it a retro zombie authenticity lacking from some apocoliptic games. loss of stamina is annoying, especially when a horde of zeds decides to turn up! but in truth it adds a little more dynamic to the game, making you think about exit stratagies before searching a property, worth noting, check rooms and close doors behind you!\n\nI've found using vehicles to draw enemies out and run them over was a good strategy but you'll go through a fair few vehicles this way so ensure you are able to repair them, and also dont ram a juggernaught at full speed, nasty consequences as i found out when i lost one of the games first notable characters. Yes when someone dies they stay dead, no continues or respawns, there gone!\n\nGonna wrap this up now by saying if you want something a bit different from the normal zombie game, this could probably be for you, with a price tag thats not too bad considering the other titles out there. not quite completed this yet but i'm around 10 hours in and im still hooked, i'll be downloading the dlc once the games complete for more action!","June 4, 2014","true","20.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I decided to include the game in general.\n\nState of Decay is absolutely a must have for those who enjoy Zombie Apocalypse Simulators. The gameplay is fun, suspenseful and sometimes risks need to be taken to survive. When you have to fight zombies it's best to avoid the large groups because you WILL die, it's a problem you may have to deal with and sometimes you'll lose your favorite guy in the group. You will constantly need to restock on supplies especially after you come back, Things will happen even when you're not playing. I know because when I came back the next day there was three to five missions on my map and my supplies went down a couple digits.\n\nI enjoyed the campaign, it was interesting and it kept my imagination trying to figure out what was going on. There were times when the game deviated from the main plot but it wasn't too bad. There was also the deal with expendable cars, if you blow up a car it's gone for good. No reparing a dead car so if you can you should make the effort to avoid hitting large crowds of zombies or your vehicle will get bent out of shape.\n\nIn the Breakdown DLC you are basically playing in sandbox mode, at the start you pick a settlement with what little supplies you have and start where you want in a small area with very few survivors. You can just focus on survival, and there is also the part where if you are able to perform certain tasks you can gain special survivors. But when you're moving on to a higher difficulty in Breakdown you can only bring a handful of your survivors so choose carefully.\n\nI don't know much about Lifeline but I will say this, it's a refreshing change of scenery, literally. A whole new map, with a whole new storyline. It may be the same gameplay but I was surprised by how much was changed. There are some bugs but they're not game-breaking.\n\nI personally believe this game has alot of potential and with the new DLC I certainly believe Undead Labs is in the process of something great. Take my word for it when I say, if your a fan of Zombie games this one is a must.\n\n","May 31, 2014","true","160.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/srvnormandy/recommended/241540/","srvnormandy","GeriatricSix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/srvnormandy/","274 products in account","Let me just start off by saying that I play console and PC, meaning I've actually had this game on console long before I had it on PC, and that I've also played it vigorously on console, so when you see I have under 20 hours of this on my profile, I've only recently got it on PC, but I've got at least a good 50 -7ish hours on console. Anyways here we go.\n\nState of Decay is a true survival-horror zombie game done right. Resources really are limited, once you've cleared out a house and taken all the supplies from it, it stays empty. There are quite a few vehicles to find out in the game world which are also limited. Sure, you could spend the next hour or two running over hordes (I'll be using the horde example a lot since they're one of your greatest threats in the game) in a truck, but once that thing explodes, you can't fix it. This means that you can't exactly go on a good killing rampage (which is kinda good since that's not the point of the game anyways).\n\nYou really do have to manage your resources, including ammunition, medicine, building supplies, fuel, and food. As I stated earlier, things won't respawn, so you have to choose when moving down a horde with a shotgun is a good time or not, givin that you won't be the only survivor needing those shells. You mmust also manage all those resources when your upgrading your base as well. Say you're running low on building supplies and only have enough for one upgrade/new building... do you want to upgrade the infimiry to help prevent your people from getting the Black Plague and other illnesses, or do you want to make a workshop which not only lets your repair weapons and vehicles, but will later allow you to create suppressors for your weapons and other things as well? You'll have to make many choices with these things in mind as you go through the game.\n\nGameplay is also quite good as well. To put it bluntly, you survive. Sounds exciting, da? Nyet? Fine, here comes your essay you entitled little fuc-\nGameplay is pretty fun. As I'll talk about later int the game, you're no super-hero, you're just a person. A person however, with stats and perks. These stats and perks will benefit that character of course. You have stats such as Cardio, Wits, Shooting, and a few other stats I can't recall currently. With cardio, your stamina increases, allowing you dodge more attacks, sprint longer, perform more actions like jumping and climbing longer without getting tired, and most importantly, you can fight with your melee weapons and attacks longer in combat. Stamina is especially useful in combat since it's tied to so many things. If your still fighting a horde with low stamina, your attacks and reflexes  become slower and weaker, making you much more vulnerable. Wits allows you to search areas faster. This is very important when you're out scavenging, that way you can grab what you can and get out faster. And shooting is exactly what it sounds like. But not only will you become more accurate, you'll also reload guns faster too.\n\nNow for the perks. "Perks" aren't things like "RAMIREZ, KILL 7 ZOMBIES FOR AN AC-130!", they're small little positives or negatives. Positives like the "sharpshooter" perk, which allows your shooting skills to level up faster or "swift-hands" that let's your melee level up faster are small little things that'll have that character slightly in some what. Negavies would be things like "bum knee" makes you lose stamina while sneaking or "a-pack-a-day" which has your cardio level up slower.\n\nMelee combat is what you want ALL of your characters to excel at. Melee is the attack you'll be using most often in this game to help conserve ammo, and not attract the attention of every zombie in a 70 meter radius like a gun would. Basically, you take your melee weapon, and you go crack/slice some heads open. You can also do a normal attack like a kick and push to stun zombies and give you some room. There are also "executions" you can do to a zombie by standing over one on the ground and using the execute key to smash their head open with your weapon, knee, or even your boots. Using this same key while sneaking up behind a zombie in stealth mode will allow you to do a sneak attack, instantly and quietly killing them.\n\nStealth is also a large part of the game. At times, running out in the open isn't always the best idea. So I hope your character doesn't have the "bum knee" penalty, because you're likely to spend a lot of time crouching around. Not only will you have to stay out of sight, but you also have to be careful about the noise you make too.  Things like crashing through a window will bring you a lot of new "friends"\n\nThis game also features permanent death as well, meaning you can't play the super-hero that "dies", then respawns at your base. If you take a character out and get ambushed and die, that character stays dead. Thanks to this, you also have to choose your battles more wisely and fallback more on stealth than other zombie games.\n\nOne word. IMMURSION(probably spelled wrong). You truely do feel like you're out in the country surviving in the apocslypse. Zombies everywhere, town feels like your "down souf", weapons feel like they belong there, and the lighting truley does help too. The soundtrack also helps too. The appropriate music always seems to play for whatever you're doing. Nice, comfy music plays when your at the base during daytime upgrading things or just hanging around, a nice ambience plays while you're out exploring, grim, "darker" music plays when your in the middle of battle against overwhelming odds. And did I mention the lighting? When the crack of dawn comes forth and you can finally see things clearly without a flashlight, you truely do learn to love daylight. And then there's night. It's dark. I mean dark dark. Not just any kind of dark, I mean, DARK. You don't want to confront groups of zombies in the dark either, since you can barely even see with your flashlight. This makes raiding houses at night seem much cooler, but you'll barely be able to see anything, even with your light on (almost like real life).\n\nNow for some cons.\n1. Zombies enjoy clipping through things such as fences and sometimes the floor of buildings your currently in. While this isn't that bad most of the time, it can become a pain in the ♥♥♥ when fighting special infected like ferals who are very quick and lethal.\n2. Your AI survivors can be quite lazy, resulting in you having to go out and do most of the work. The other characters do leave to go scavenging as well once in a while, but usually they end up getting into trouble and you have to go save them.\n3. Your AI survivors are too emotional. Morale is a big part of the game, should it get too low, people start leaving and mutinies can arise. While this might add to the whole "realistic immursion" or however it's spelt/said, these kinds of things happen a little to often for my liking. A character will start becoming depressed and start bringing everyone down, you gotta go back to base, take em out for a quick jog somewhere, kill a few zombies, and return home after a brief warning/talking too. While that doesn't sound bad, it becomes annoying quick when only an hour or two after cheering them up, someone at home is mad and making everyone else mad. Then you go through the jog n kill routine again. While not really a game-killing thing, I just found it annoying after a while when there are more important tasks to attend to.\n4. Vehcles control like your driving on a road of cheap gravy. It's mainly just turning in some of the vehicles I have a problem with.\nAnd that's pretty much it for State of Decay.\nI'd honestly give it a 8/10.\nNice, great zombie game with actual resource management, a great, big map to play around in, a ton of weapons with limited ammo that can break, and lotz of zombies to kill and sneak around. Probably one of the best zombie games I've ever played, and I've played a lot of em too.","December 25, 2014","true","36.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In this game at any time you can be overpowered by a horde of zombies and taken down as you can run out of energy and get winded..

If only they implemented multiplayer, it would have been the perfect zombie game if they had. Nevertheless, State of Decay absolutely had my heart and kept me on my toes. I had to wait all the way until the end before I wrote this though.\nI personally liked the story, though it flings you right into the action and explains the game a bit before sending you out by yourself to fare the harsh world. During your time in the game, you'll make decisions that will sway the happenings in Trumbull valley until you manage to escape. Whether you save every person you meet or leave them all to their grim demise, once you've settled into the church it all begins. Some of the zombie threats were very challenging, especially taking on specials alongside hordes, but it's all doable. Caution and preparation are key to success.\nLittle shortcomings in the game include it's occasional oddity and glitch, one of which was a Juggernaut zombie somehow phasing through the fence AND the door to my base to slaughter one of my favorite characters. Another fault is in small effects not registering, like killing a specific special zombie not triggering the end of the mission. Apart from where the game acts up, it runs fairly smooth and I recommend playing it with a controller over keyboard and mouse.\n\nOh Sgt. Erik Tan... So noble, yet so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.

This game focuses more on gathering ressources, having good relations with other communities, survive as a group, than kill every zombie you see, and scavenge everything. For some, this is what they don't like, and other, what they prefer. In my case, I fall in love with the open world, the different communities all over the map, and the fact that you actually have to survive in GROUP. Anyone that liked The Walking Dead series on TV should love this piece of art. The only concern are the graphics (no advanced settings), and some zombies issues (they go through walls sometimes, they fall under porch, etc). Out of 10, I'd give it a 8.5.

Can't forget the zombies, lots of zombies!\n\nThe game takes place in the fictional Trumbull Valley which consists of 4 mainish areas and some farmland etc which are all connected in an open world concept. You have a campsite lake where you start of at, and 3 small towns: Spencer's Mill, Marshall City, and Fairfield, the last being the smallest. So at the off set you and a buddy are at the campgrounds and are attacked by some "crazy people"  aka zombies and have no idea what's going on. From there, after some gameplay which includes killing and fending off zombies of course heh, you end up joining a small community at a church in Spencer's Mill. This becomes your first home base. You will now get some missions and objectives to survive the zombies and advance the storyline.\n\nThings to do include gathering various supplies like food, ammo, fuel, medicine..very important if you don't want to die or have your fellows turn on you haha. As well as build various structures at your home base in the slots provided, these of course require different supplies previously mentioned and some special items you have to go get. All the while zombies are roming the streets, attacking you wherever you go ^^","December 21, 2014","true","144.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Well, one year later, after I've had time to process this game all I can say is this:\nThis game is the greatest zombie apocalypse simulator ever made.\nI've never played a game that even comes close to the pure genius that is State of Decay (Sorry DayZ fans, but no contest here). While I admit the graphics in this game are a bit dated, there are a few annoying but minor glitches, and after many many hours of this game it can start to feel repetitive but everything else more than makes up for it. The controls are reminiscent of Resident Evil 4, the atmostphere is similar to that of The Walking Dead, and the ability to control an entire group of survivors trying to survive a zombie apocalypse is just the icing on the cake. If you don't already have this game do yourself a favor and BUY IT NOW (At the time of this review it is currently 75% off the base game and both DLC) I also recommend the Breakdown DLC if you're looking for more of a challenge and the Lifeline DLC for an entirely new story.\n\nOverall Review:\n+Brilliant Game Design\n+Amazing Atmosphere\n+Hours of Replayability\n-Slightly Dated Graphics/Minor Glitches\n\n9.5/10","December 19, 2014","true","96.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

I'd say the most exciting moments in it are not as good as the best moments in Dead Island or Left 4 Dead 2, but the whole base building and team management thing is a great spin on this genre that makes it different from either of those two games.  I had fun playing it, but it does It have some annoyances such as camp members who run off at random times, so even after you rescue and make friends with them they aren't available to switch to most of the time when you want to.  The length of the campaign is about 15-20 hours probably and that seems about right.  I liked Dead Island's action better than this one, but that game's campaign ended up lasting much too long so by the end of the game it was just tedious.","July 2, 2014","true","199.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/srvnormandy/recommended/241540/","srvnormandy","GeriatricSix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/srvnormandy/","274 products in account","Let me just start off by saying that I play console and PC, meaning I've actually had this game on console long before I had it on PC, and that I've also played it vigorously on console, so when you see I have under 20 hours of this on my profile, I've only recently got it on PC, but I've got at least a good 50 -7ish hours on console. Anyways here we go.\n\nState of Decay is a true survival-horror zombie game done right. Resources really are limited, once you've cleared out a house and taken all the supplies from it, it stays empty. There are quite a few vehicles to find out in the game world which are also limited. Sure, you could spend the next hour or two running over hordes (I'll be using the horde example a lot since they're one of your greatest threats in the game) in a truck, but once that thing explodes, you can't fix it. This means that you can't exactly go on a good killing rampage (which is kinda good since that's not the point of the game anyways).\n\nYou really do have to manage your resources, including ammunition, medicine, building supplies, fuel, and food. As I stated earlier, things won't respawn, so you have to choose when moving down a horde with a shotgun is a good time or not, givin that you won't be the only survivor needing those shells. You mmust also manage all those resources when your upgrading your base as well. Say you're running low on building supplies and only have enough for one upgrade/new building... do you want to upgrade the infimiry to help prevent your people from getting the Black Plague and other illnesses, or do you want to make a workshop which not only lets your repair weapons and vehicles, but will later allow you to create suppressors for your weapons and other things as well? You'll have to make many choices with these things in mind as you go through the game.\n\nGameplay is also quite good as well. To put it bluntly, you survive. Sounds exciting, da? Nyet? Fine, here comes your essay you entitled little fuc-\nGameplay is pretty fun. As I'll talk about later int the game, you're no super-hero, you're just a person. A person however, with stats and perks. These stats and perks will benefit that character of course. You have stats such as Cardio, Wits, Shooting, and a few other stats I can't recall currently. With cardio, your stamina increases, allowing you dodge more attacks, sprint longer, perform more actions like jumping and climbing longer without getting tired, and most importantly, you can fight with your melee weapons and attacks longer in combat. Stamina is especially useful in combat since it's tied to so many things. If your still fighting a horde with low stamina, your attacks and reflexes  become slower and weaker, making you much more vulnerable. Wits allows you to search areas faster. This is very important when you're out scavenging, that way you can grab what you can and get out faster. And shooting is exactly what it sounds like. But not only will you become more accurate, you'll also reload guns faster too.\n\nNow for the perks. "Perks" aren't things like "RAMIREZ, KILL 7 ZOMBIES FOR AN AC-130!", they're small little positives or negatives. Positives like the "sharpshooter" perk, which allows your shooting skills to level up faster or "swift-hands" that let's your melee level up faster are small little things that'll have that character slightly in some what. Negavies would be things like "bum knee" makes you lose stamina while sneaking or "a-pack-a-day" which has your cardio level up slower.\n\nMelee combat is what you want ALL of your characters to excel at. Melee is the attack you'll be using most often in this game to help conserve ammo, and not attract the attention of every zombie in a 70 meter radius like a gun would. Basically, you take your melee weapon, and you go crack/slice some heads open. You can also do a normal attack like a kick and push to stun zombies and give you some room. There are also "executions" you can do to a zombie by standing over one on the ground and using the execute key to smash their head open with your weapon, knee, or even your boots. Using this same key while sneaking up behind a zombie in stealth mode will allow you to do a sneak attack, instantly and quietly killing them.\n\nStealth is also a large part of the game. At times, running out in the open isn't always the best idea. So I hope your character doesn't have the "bum knee" penalty, because you're likely to spend a lot of time crouching around. Not only will you have to stay out of sight, but you also have to be careful about the noise you make too.  Things like crashing through a window will bring you a lot of new "friends"\n\nThis game also features permanent death as well, meaning you can't play the super-hero that "dies", then respawns at your base. If you take a character out and get ambushed and die, that character stays dead. Thanks to this, you also have to choose your battles more wisely and fallback more on stealth than other zombie games.\n\nOne word. IMMURSION(probably spelled wrong). You truely do feel like you're out in the country surviving in the apocslypse. Zombies everywhere, town feels like your "down souf", weapons feel like they belong there, and the lighting truley does help too. The soundtrack also helps too. The appropriate music always seems to play for whatever you're doing. Nice, comfy music plays when your at the base during daytime upgrading things or just hanging around, a nice ambience plays while you're out exploring, grim, "darker" music plays when your in the middle of battle against overwhelming odds. And did I mention the lighting? When the crack of dawn comes forth and you can finally see things clearly without a flashlight, you truely do learn to love daylight. And then there's night. It's dark. I mean dark dark. Not just any kind of dark, I mean, DARK. You don't want to confront groups of zombies in the dark either, since you can barely even see with your flashlight. This makes raiding houses at night seem much cooler, but you'll barely be able to see anything, even with your light on (almost like real life).\n\nNow for some cons.\n1. Zombies enjoy clipping through things such as fences and sometimes the floor of buildings your currently in. While this isn't that bad most of the time, it can become a pain in the ♥♥♥ when fighting special infected like ferals who are very quick and lethal.\n2. Your AI survivors can be quite lazy, resulting in you having to go out and do most of the work. The other characters do leave to go scavenging as well once in a while, but usually they end up getting into trouble and you have to go save them.\n3. Your AI survivors are too emotional. Morale is a big part of the game, should it get too low, people start leaving and mutinies can arise. While this might add to the whole "realistic immursion" or however it's spelt/said, these kinds of things happen a little to often for my liking. A character will start becoming depressed and start bringing everyone down, you gotta go back to base, take em out for a quick jog somewhere, kill a few zombies, and return home after a brief warning/talking too. While that doesn't sound bad, it becomes annoying quick when only an hour or two after cheering them up, someone at home is mad and making everyone else mad. Then you go through the jog n kill routine again. While not really a game-killing thing, I just found it annoying after a while when there are more important tasks to attend to.\n4. Vehcles control like your driving on a road of cheap gravy. It's mainly just turning in some of the vehicles I have a problem with.\nAnd that's pretty much it for State of Decay.\nI'd honestly give it a 8/10.\nNice, great zombie game with actual resource management, a great, big map to play around in, a ton of weapons with limited ammo that can break, and lotz of zombies to kill and sneak around. Probably one of the best zombie games I've ever played, and I've played a lot of em too.","December 25, 2014","true","36.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I found starting from scratch to be more entertaining than late endgame\n-The other survivors' AI can be stupid quite often, getting themselves chewed on with ease\n\nMinor stuff I complain about and might not be so important for you:\n-Unrealistic/cartoonish looks for some of you out there (they're ok, but...)\n-Lack of easily visible explanations for advanced controls (ie combos)\n-Almost half of the mechanics aren't explained anywhere (ie outpost resources and their costs)\n-Zombies sometimes spawn right behind you following the sound mechanics, but the place was just clear...\n-Cars can make things all too easy sometimes, killing bunch of zombies in one go\n-Lack of hard-to-reach places, special points of interest, "secrets", etc\n-Unsatisfying main storyline ending, at least in my opinion\n\nIf you've read this far, why not give you some more text...\n\nThis game feels like bunch of good ideas but with just a decent execution. It could have been much, much better with more work, yet I guess the original console constraints took that away. However, IT WORKS. It's a cool zombie experience, it has many classic stuff like hordes of zeds assaulting a position that you need to barricade and fight for, hit n' run rescue missions and the (not so classical) special zeds, that actually reminded me a lot of Dead Island.\nYou get a really good game for the 20 bucks price tag, that is very fun to play and despite being easy at times, it can also be very punishing. Sometimes you're Rambo, sometimes you're Deadmeat. Watch yourself out there.\nThere is another small Pro, and that is the Mod community. It's still small, but it will grow and that will only extend the game's life. If you're handy with that stuff, check the Nexus Mods.\n\nI'd say it's a solid 8/10. Absolutely recommended for zombie lovers out there.","July 16, 2014","true","109.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Zombies occasionally walk through walls, the clipping on certain objects is 'interesting' to say the least, and the controls are hard to get used to. But all the minor points aside, this game is hella fun.\n\nI completed my first playthrough in 16 hours, and I've barely touched the surface on everything I could do. Many, many more hours will be spent doing everything and going everywhere I can, whilst unlocking all the Steam achivements. It's the first single-player game that's gripped me this much for a long while, and a real killer in the zombie genre.\n\nI think it would be possible to play and survive in this game almost indefinitely - at least until you run out of certain resources, anyway. It was great fun to find and save and then play as other survivors at will, feeling a real sense of shame and disappointment when I unwittingly led one to their permanent death shortly afterwards. I've never played a game with such a persistent environment, and whilst the tutorial is lacking a lot, playing about on my own I realised there is SO much you can do. And intend to go back and do it all, now!\n\nI highly suggest you play this game. Pronto.","January 3, 2014","true","18.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It doesn't rely heavily on the "jumpscare" which I love. The game isn't soley built on fighting zombies. It's about surviving the long game. In order to succeed you need to scavange, set up outposts, upgrade your home base. You need to look for weapons for yourself, but also buidling, medical, food, and ammo supplies for your group to survive.\n\nYou need to manage relationships with other groups of survivors by rescuing them, or ignoring the pleas for help so you can run another mission that you need for supplies.\n\nYou need to manage your folks as well, playing as one character can hurt you in the long run, you need to play multiple folks and level them up as well. If your singlely played character dies you're in for a long tough road ahead.  The game does a great job reminding you of this as each player will fatigue when they've been outside the safe zone for too long, so you are reminded that you need to swap characters.\n\nThe best part is for a zombie survival game you dont' need to kill zombies. There are no drops, no added bonus to offing them, other than keeping you and your home safe, so hiding in bushes, or staying quiet to save ammo and mele weapons isn't peanized one bit.\n\nI'm 10 hours in and only feel like I"ve started. but I can't stop playing, everything else in my library sits idle while I contine to fight for the living.","January 25, 2014","true","20.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have not found any glaring faults as yet, though I do wish vehicles carried more items (a kitchen timer should not really take up the same space as a duffle bag in the back of a pickup truck) and that fully metal weapons, such as a pipe, lasted far, far longer than they do.\n\nDeaths are real, and as a character dies you are stuck with whomever is left. While that does not change the game itself, it does limit what you are able to do later in the game if you have not been working on all the available characters' skills. I consider this a bonus, as it prevents the game from getting boring.\n\nVehicle stability is reminiscent of Grand Theft Auto. This is a good thing.\n\nI have not played The Walking Dead series, so I have no basis for comparison.

After that it could have played like a Big Mac and an ice cold beer, and I still would have been looking how awful the graphics were.\n\nHowever, I did like the idea, and when I saw it was coming out on PC I was interested. Graphics are not much better, but at least 1080p is supported so it just looks a bit unpolished, and not resembling a zombie minecraft like it does on the 360.\n\nWould I recommend? Sure, it's a nice, deep game. Once you get used to the interface then it really opens up. Running missions, improving your character, building bases up. Very fun, and very enjoyable. One thing to be wary of, that bloke you start off as? If he dies, that's it...no coming back you have to be a new person and start levelling their skills again.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PootisFuck/recommended/241540/","PootisFuck","Diner","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PootisFuck/","116 products in account","Seeing i poured more hours into this game than the average review-writing player, i figured i should write my own review as well. There might be spoilers.\nSo here goes:\n\nI'm not a fan of most zombie games, which seem to revolve around "shoot millions of zombies to win". There is no "winning" State of decay. The zombies are everywhere and the horde is endless. The base game ends when your survivors manage to leave Trumbull Valley and you are left wondering "How long will they last without my help?"\nAnd this is exactly what i love about State of Decay.\n\nThe game & DLC's in a nutshell:\n\nState of Decay:\nYou and your buddy went on your annual fishing trip, while you were gone large swaths of the US have been overrun by zombies. You get attacked as soon as you tie off your boat. Fighting them off is easy enough but now need to figure out what happened and where you can find a safe place to stay. Jump in the nearest car and meet up with fellow survivors holed up at a church. Then the game begins for real and answers are gradually given.\n\nBreakdown:\nSame map, alternate storyline. Several weeks after the outbreak, you and Lily are the last 2 survivors of an enclave and you know you wont last much longer on your own. While you look for another enclave to join, Lily packs up and will meet you there with whatever supplies are left. Once settled it's back to basics: survive for as long as you can. You quickly realize resources are dwindling while zombie numbers increase. Eventually it's time to move on: you pack all equipment in the RV, load up your most important survivors and look for a new home. Your new home is on the exact same map, but with fresh resources and.. more zombies.\n\nLifeline:\nNew map. You are in command of the last military outpost in the overrun city of Danforth. You must secure your base, shore up your defenses and start the search for various survivors. The brass will direct you to high-value assets: scientists, doctors and their families whose expertise might be crucial to find an eventual cure. Along the way stranded survivors cry out for help and you're the only one with the means to respond. Your actions will decide the fate of not only Danforth, but possibly the whole world.\n\n\nI'll do a short pros and cons but there are a few things i should really point out first. State of Decay is not about killing lots of zombies. It is about people trying to survive the zombie apocalypse. There are endless zombies but finite resources. Sure, it is great fun to smash your truck into a few zombie hordes or grab a machine gun and go on a killing spree, but that's not the intention of the game. When you're done a good truck will be broken, perhaps beyond repair. Or a lot of bullets will have been wasted on ever respawning zombies. So when you clear an area of zombies, you damn better scavenge as much as you can.\n\nWhen you scavenge you may find resources you can use to improve your base or tools for zombie killing. Food and various painkillers/stimulants are also often found. There are a few possible home sites (bases) in the game for you to eventually choose from. Each of them has certain requisites and advantages/disadvantages, but larger is better :). Always you have to make tough choices: will i go for a workshop to repair weapons & cars, or rather a field hospital to aid the people who will inevitably fall sick? No one wants to go down with Black Fever.. trust me. Maybe i can have both IF i sacrifice room for the workout area, but then all survivors will have less stamina and fighting skills.. Choices.\nOver the course of the game missions will pop up: help scavenging, clear out an infestation, save a survivor, trade resources with your neighbours, kill a freak zombie.\n\nUnfortunately most of these missions can be boiled down to a simple fact: your fellow survivors have the mental capacity and survival skill of a baked potato. You are the only one who's good at it, and it's up to you to do ALL the work. I found this annoying when i first played the game and put it aside for a few weeks for that reason only. However, if you accept that's just how it is, embrace it, and you'll still have a most enjoyable game.\nA few other points of light irritation:\n- Graphics: good enough for a game of this price, but definately not top notch.\n- Controls: especially car controls feel sluggish.\n- Clipping: zombies occasionally clip trough solid objects. Not a problem if it's just a regular zombie, a bit more annoying when it's a Big Un or Feral in an enclosed space.\n- Useless survivors: Plenty of them and no "clean" way to get rid of them.\n\nThe pros:\nOpen world game: You go where you want, when you want.\nPermadeath: Your survivor got ambushed and killed? He's dead, no reloading an earlier save.\nStamina & carry capacity: The game's way of saying you're just an average Joe, not Rambo.\nTraits and Skills: The game's way of taking the "average" out of "average Joe"\nSoundtrack: Composed by Jesper Kyd. 'Nuff said.\nMods: Don't like this or that? Maybe want to see more of that other stuff? Check out the modding community, or find out how to do it yourself. Besides tweaking Breakdown to make it more enjoyable, i also added myself as a playable character. Much fun was had.\n\nAll in all i found this a very enjoyable game and the DLC's are definately worth it. Has been on sale several times @ -66% orso.\nEven grabbed back to it a few months after i finished it.","February 14, 2015","true","6.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The morale/save me missions can get pretty annoying when you're spread thin in the beginning.\n\nAll in all, it got a 79 metascore but could've had the potential of a 90+ game, which in itself is a bit disappointing, but nonetheless worth playing, especially for $10","June 4, 2014","true","64.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The concept is exactly what I believe people have been waiting for in a zombie game. Base building, character development, finding surviors and resource gathering. It's definately worth a play - but it's a one time play through. If this game comes out with some expansions and DLC then it would make a great game.\n\nIn this game you start as a survior who came back to small town life to find the world in ruins and zombies everywhere. Your saved by the kindness of a small survival group that sets you on your way. The goal is to build a base camp, gather supplies to run your base and find other survivors then escape the militarized zone.\n\nPROS\n\nThe 3rd person shooter stand point makes it a fun action game while keeping in mind your need to keep finding materials to build. Keeps the game exciting. Backpack weightlimits and sizes are adequete as well. You'll have to pick and choose what you want to carry out and back and the game keeps this pretty accurate with stamina penalties for carrying more than you should.\n\nCharacter developments are ok as everyone you find has a different history, background and can benefit, or take away from, the work that needs to be done. For instance, you may find someone who was a chef and he can be your cook. Or you may find an alcoholic prick that is lazy and makes morale lower. It's easy enough to kill these people if you dont like them though. This small addition makes you feel a bit of a connection to the characters you find - and yes - anyone you find you can play as and take on missions.\n\nThe game is wide enough to explore and can keep you on your toes as zombies chase you from one side of the map to the next. Nightfall makes things interesting and there is definately a spook factor. There are many different factions that you can help keep alive, or vice versa, but their role in the game is slim.\n\nZombie base building is always exciting. There are many options to choose from depending on the size of your group and base size. Build your base depending on how you choose to play. Its always fun to come back from zombie killing to see the fruits of your labor flurishing behind a barbed wire fence. Definte plus.\n\nCONS:\n\nThe game lacks story line and substance. The game itself is actually pretty short and the story doesn't leave you in awe. Plus, you find yourself running the same missions over and over again ultimately praying a person from the main quest line shows up so you can move on. The regurgitation of the same missions seems non-stop and frankly gets annoying.\n\nAlong the lines of substance - you only fight one enemy! What happened to raiders or rival survivors groups! What about fighting the military? This makes it a bit less attractive and in my opinion much easier to win.\n\nYou also do not get the ability to choose who stays at base camp to defend and work and who runs willy nilly through town. Its frustrating to come back from a mission to see half your people have run off into the city and are unavailble to you - then you have to go off to save them. You dont get to assign duties as the game automatically chooses. It'd be nice to have more control over assignments.\n\nLots of glitches that need to be worked out. You'll run into invisible rocks, walk through closed doors or jump through windows that don't shatter. Zombies will get stuck in walls then suddenly appear. The driving is a tad glitchy and frames can skip causing unintended collisions. Overall its not too bad but little things like that can make the game much more enjoyable.\n\nResources!! There are three main types - Food, Ammo and Fuel? Yes Fuel. I never once used it. That seems more like a commodity especially since the game doesn't give you any reason to have it. Water would seem more appropriate. That seems like an unforgivable oversight in a zombie survival game.\n\nOVERALL:\n\nIts definately worth one play through - maybe buy it when its on sale. If the creators worked 3 more months on the game it could have been turned into a great game. With some DLCS and patches this game could become great.","November 12, 2013","true","69.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/srvnormandy/recommended/241540/","srvnormandy","GeriatricSix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/srvnormandy/","274 products in account","Let me just start off by saying that I play console and PC, meaning I've actually had this game on console long before I had it on PC, and that I've also played it vigorously on console, so when you see I have under 20 hours of this on my profile, I've only recently got it on PC, but I've got at least a good 50 -7ish hours on console. Anyways here we go.\n\nState of Decay is a true survival-horror zombie game done right. Resources really are limited, once you've cleared out a house and taken all the supplies from it, it stays empty. There are quite a few vehicles to find out in the game world which are also limited. Sure, you could spend the next hour or two running over hordes (I'll be using the horde example a lot since they're one of your greatest threats in the game) in a truck, but once that thing explodes, you can't fix it. This means that you can't exactly go on a good killing rampage (which is kinda good since that's not the point of the game anyways).\n\nYou really do have to manage your resources, including ammunition, medicine, building supplies, fuel, and food. As I stated earlier, things won't respawn, so you have to choose when moving down a horde with a shotgun is a good time or not, givin that you won't be the only survivor needing those shells. You mmust also manage all those resources when your upgrading your base as well. Say you're running low on building supplies and only have enough for one upgrade/new building... do you want to upgrade the infimiry to help prevent your people from getting the Black Plague and other illnesses, or do you want to make a workshop which not only lets your repair weapons and vehicles, but will later allow you to create suppressors for your weapons and other things as well? You'll have to make many choices with these things in mind as you go through the game.\n\nGameplay is also quite good as well. To put it bluntly, you survive. Sounds exciting, da? Nyet? Fine, here comes your essay you entitled little fuc-\nGameplay is pretty fun. As I'll talk about later int the game, you're no super-hero, you're just a person. A person however, with stats and perks. These stats and perks will benefit that character of course. You have stats such as Cardio, Wits, Shooting, and a few other stats I can't recall currently. With cardio, your stamina increases, allowing you dodge more attacks, sprint longer, perform more actions like jumping and climbing longer without getting tired, and most importantly, you can fight with your melee weapons and attacks longer in combat. Stamina is especially useful in combat since it's tied to so many things. If your still fighting a horde with low stamina, your attacks and reflexes  become slower and weaker, making you much more vulnerable. Wits allows you to search areas faster. This is very important when you're out scavenging, that way you can grab what you can and get out faster. And shooting is exactly what it sounds like. But not only will you become more accurate, you'll also reload guns faster too.\n\nNow for the perks. "Perks" aren't things like "RAMIREZ, KILL 7 ZOMBIES FOR AN AC-130!", they're small little positives or negatives. Positives like the "sharpshooter" perk, which allows your shooting skills to level up faster or "swift-hands" that let's your melee level up faster are small little things that'll have that character slightly in some what. Negavies would be things like "bum knee" makes you lose stamina while sneaking or "a-pack-a-day" which has your cardio level up slower.\n\nMelee combat is what you want ALL of your characters to excel at. Melee is the attack you'll be using most often in this game to help conserve ammo, and not attract the attention of every zombie in a 70 meter radius like a gun would. Basically, you take your melee weapon, and you go crack/slice some heads open. You can also do a normal attack like a kick and push to stun zombies and give you some room. There are also "executions" you can do to a zombie by standing over one on the ground and using the execute key to smash their head open with your weapon, knee, or even your boots. Using this same key while sneaking up behind a zombie in stealth mode will allow you to do a sneak attack, instantly and quietly killing them.\n\nStealth is also a large part of the game. At times, running out in the open isn't always the best idea. So I hope your character doesn't have the "bum knee" penalty, because you're likely to spend a lot of time crouching around. Not only will you have to stay out of sight, but you also have to be careful about the noise you make too.  Things like crashing through a window will bring you a lot of new "friends"\n\nThis game also features permanent death as well, meaning you can't play the super-hero that "dies", then respawns at your base. If you take a character out and get ambushed and die, that character stays dead. Thanks to this, you also have to choose your battles more wisely and fallback more on stealth than other zombie games.\n\nOne word. IMMURSION(probably spelled wrong). You truely do feel like you're out in the country surviving in the apocslypse. Zombies everywhere, town feels like your "down souf", weapons feel like they belong there, and the lighting truley does help too. The soundtrack also helps too. The appropriate music always seems to play for whatever you're doing. Nice, comfy music plays when your at the base during daytime upgrading things or just hanging around, a nice ambience plays while you're out exploring, grim, "darker" music plays when your in the middle of battle against overwhelming odds. And did I mention the lighting? When the crack of dawn comes forth and you can finally see things clearly without a flashlight, you truely do learn to love daylight. And then there's night. It's dark. I mean dark dark. Not just any kind of dark, I mean, DARK. You don't want to confront groups of zombies in the dark either, since you can barely even see with your flashlight. This makes raiding houses at night seem much cooler, but you'll barely be able to see anything, even with your light on (almost like real life).\n\nNow for some cons.\n1. Zombies enjoy clipping through things such as fences and sometimes the floor of buildings your currently in. While this isn't that bad most of the time, it can become a pain in the ♥♥♥ when fighting special infected like ferals who are very quick and lethal.\n2. Your AI survivors can be quite lazy, resulting in you having to go out and do most of the work. The other characters do leave to go scavenging as well once in a while, but usually they end up getting into trouble and you have to go save them.\n3. Your AI survivors are too emotional. Morale is a big part of the game, should it get too low, people start leaving and mutinies can arise. While this might add to the whole "realistic immursion" or however it's spelt/said, these kinds of things happen a little to often for my liking. A character will start becoming depressed and start bringing everyone down, you gotta go back to base, take em out for a quick jog somewhere, kill a few zombies, and return home after a brief warning/talking too. While that doesn't sound bad, it becomes annoying quick when only an hour or two after cheering them up, someone at home is mad and making everyone else mad. Then you go through the jog n kill routine again. While not really a game-killing thing, I just found it annoying after a while when there are more important tasks to attend to.\n4. Vehcles control like your driving on a road of cheap gravy. It's mainly just turning in some of the vehicles I have a problem with.\nAnd that's pretty much it for State of Decay.\nI'd honestly give it a 8/10.\nNice, great zombie game with actual resource management, a great, big map to play around in, a ton of weapons with limited ammo that can break, and lotz of zombies to kill and sneak around. Probably one of the best zombie games I've ever played, and I've played a lot of em too.","December 25, 2014","true","36.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I highly reccomend the DLC "Breakdown" package after you play through the story which leaves you to scavenge until you have to fix an RV and restart the map with a higher difficulty each time you move out . If you're a survival horror guru then this title is for you. Despite this being a console port it is a great title for the low price.","December 1, 2013","true","75.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I don't so much wanna review it as just make sure new-comers know; I (along with many others I'm sure) greatly recommend poeple at LEAST try playing around with the George Romero mod settings, (just back up your save first. Things can get dangerous fast, don't wont that survivor you have been powerlevling for a week to get perma-ate) as far as mods ussually go in my opnion its pretty easy to follow. You can make the zombie population near impossible to survive, make them fast, make zombie attacks  more realistic and take surviors out in 1 bite, etc. Theres alot!

You need to manage your own survivals and produce, scavange resources to stay alive in the world.Try to keep alive your fellow survivors and make sure they dont go insane. Hard to jugde the game but its ambitous for an indie dev. The game has bugs here and there but not gamebreaking, mostly visual glitches. The game was an XBLA premiere game but finally here on the pc with added visual options and mouse keyboard support (still i recommend the X360 controller). Sadly the game is too easy but you can purchase the Breakdown DLC and amass the no story 100% survival  with increased difficulty and replayablility.\nSo Im recommanding if you wan to speand some hours in your persoanl zombie apocalypse :)\n","December 9, 2013","true","12.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The base building and resource management is a constant source of both pressure and accomplishment; trying to house, feed supply and develop 20+ people is a challenge.\nTime becomes a big issue in this game, you won't have enough of it be everywhere and do everything, some things simply have to be prioritized. You may WANT to help those farmers out, but you have a team member in trouble and your base is nearly out of food and ammo...\nAll up, SoD is a pretty well rounded sandboxey survivor sim.

So far the experience has been good.  I won't rate this game because it is unfinished. However things are looking up for this game.  It has good play mechanics that are unique for zombie games. Others have described it by comparing it to various other zombie games. In all fairness I have to say its got its own flavor and i don't really find the experince repetitive of other games. I recommend  this unfinished game highly i'm sure the finished version will please many zombie fans even more than it does in its current state which is very satisfing game exprience as it is.\n\nUPDATE:\nOK i've had this game a long time now and it's been finished now as well as had a few DLC release for it. So with out further stalling here's my breakdown.\n\nThe Good:\nGreat story that doesn't hit you in the head with trying to explain zombies.\nLots of characters to play as.\nNice Tired/food/water mechanic that doesn't consume your game time.\nGorgeous graphics.\n\nThe bad:\nSeemed a bit short start to finish. I highly recommend you grab the DLC to extent this one.\nRandom graphic slow downs despite having a powerful system.\nHarsh HDR lighting, some games get this tuned right some don't While this game does look great the contrast  from HDR can be a bit much at times.\n\nOverall I give this game an 82%.

Can't forget the zombies, lots of zombies!\n\nThe game takes place in the fictional Trumbull Valley which consists of 4 mainish areas and some farmland etc which are all connected in an open world concept. You have a campsite lake where you start of at, and 3 small towns: Spencer's Mill, Marshall City, and Fairfield, the last being the smallest. So at the off set you and a buddy are at the campgrounds and are attacked by some "crazy people"  aka zombies and have no idea what's going on. From there, after some gameplay which includes killing and fending off zombies of course heh, you end up joining a small community at a church in Spencer's Mill. This becomes your first home base. You will now get some missions and objectives to survive the zombies and advance the storyline.\n\nThings to do include gathering various supplies like food, ammo, fuel, medicine..very important if you don't want to die or have your fellows turn on you haha. As well as build various structures at your home base in the slots provided, these of course require different supplies previously mentioned and some special items you have to go get.

This is one of those special games that gets you hooked enough to look forward to a sequel with improved game mechanics.\n\nThe ambitions of this game is quite impressive. In gameplay, many times, all the elements will flow perfectly and the whole game will really feel like an exciting struggle for survival. Each time you go outside your compound with a character there is slight hesitation as you aren't sure if your character will survive a scavaging run, because when a character dies it is permadeath and they are gone from the game for good. Other times, various bugs will break that immersion and become frusterating. However, despite those buggy occurances, the game still shines. There is a problem where the latter half of the game will become easier as you start to horde more weapons and supplies but that is the natural side effect of becoming much better at the game. I would have liked to have seen difficulty ramp up a bit more as you go on. Though I have to admit it is satisfying nearer to the end of the game when you can just walk down mainstreet with a .45 colt and caution thrown to the wind because your characters have become survival badasses.\n\nOverall, it's an easy game to recomend to anyone who enjoys zombie beat downs and survival/horror.\n\nA final positive: this studio has been really dedicated in trying to resolve bugs and continue to improve their product which is a really nice thing to see.","May 20, 2014","true","18.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Persistent world feature caught me off guard, but it was still fun knowing the world goes on without you. And a bonus! zombie references everywhere in this world. Have fun finding them c:\n\nThe only glaring gripe I have for this game is that if you have a partner tagging along with you (from your base, not a story mission), you can't exchange items or anything really while they're standing a foot away from you outside of combat.\n\nI would love to see some multiplayer similar to what Left4Dead has done, with friends or something "taking over" a random non-storybased character from your base that isn't injured, on an optional  side mission, and/or past a certain community population (like 10 to 16 people or something).\n\nOtherwise this is an awesome game, go buy it if DayZ or Nether isn't to your particular taste.","January 3, 2014","true","106.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is the closest thing to an open world "The Walking Dead" game as we are ever gonna get. It plays like Day Z only slightly more arcade-like and way better looking. I love the feel of scvenging, going and sending people out on runs. I like the RPG-like mechanics and base building as well. While we would all love to see a multiplayer version of this, i like the feel of what this game is. I paid full price for this game and have not regretted it once. I hope the devlopers keep up all the hard work. This game does need some DLC to expand it out a smidge, but all in all a very, solid purchase.

The zombie sandbox seems vast at first, but excitement fades when you realize that the houses are pretty much the same everywhere. There aren't that many interesting items or people to find. And even though Breakdown seemingly adds more challenge to the game, things get pretty easy as soon as you've established a home base and started upgrading your characters.\n\nYour neighbors are super needy, you constantly need new equipment for your home base and there's always some shmuck that has to be saved or a zombie horde that has to be mowed down. In the end you just drive repetitively from one waypoint to another until you've helped everyone with their needy needs and the game is over.\n\nAt worst the zombies are mildly annoying. The fight system doesn't offer much immersion. You just keep clicking and "smash spacebar not to die". The game would have benefited from a more hands on fight system like they had in Condemned.\n\nState of Decay had some redeeming qualities, mainly the way you're able to earn people's trust and create a community of survivors. The scripted events breathe life into the characters who are actually able to do some useful stuff on their own while you're completing missions. And if they die you can't bring them back. The graphics are pretty okay and there's a satisfying POK sound when your baseball bat hits an armored zombie's helmet.\n\nThe game is very ambitious, and while it doesn't suck horribly, I still feel it falls short.","June 3, 2014","false","30.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I found starting from scratch to be more entertaining than late endgame\n-The other survivors' AI can be stupid quite often, getting themselves chewed on with ease\n\nMinor stuff I complain about and might not be so important for you:\n-Unrealistic/cartoonish looks for some of you out there (they're ok, but...)\n-Lack of easily visible explanations for advanced controls (ie combos)\n-Almost half of the mechanics aren't explained anywhere (ie outpost resources and their costs)\n-Zombies sometimes spawn right behind you following the sound mechanics, but the place was just clear...\n-Cars can make things all too easy sometimes, killing bunch of zombies in one go\n-Lack of hard-to-reach places, special points of interest, "secrets", etc\n-Unsatisfying main storyline ending, at least in my opinion\n\nIf you've read this far, why not give you some more text...\n\nThis game feels like bunch of good ideas but with just a decent execution. It could have been much, much better with more work, yet I guess the original console constraints took that away. However, IT WORKS. It's a cool zombie experience, it has many classic stuff like hordes of zeds assaulting a position that you need to barricade and fight for, hit n' run rescue missions and the (not so classical) special zeds, that actually reminded me a lot of Dead Island.\nYou get a really good game for the 20 bucks price tag, that is very fun to play and despite being easy at times, it can also be very punishing. Sometimes you're Rambo, sometimes you're Deadmeat. Watch yourself out there.\nThere is another small Pro, and that is the Mod community. It's still small, but it will grow and that will only extend the game's life. If you're handy with that stuff, check the Nexus Mods.\n\nI'd say it's a solid 8/10. Absolutely recommended for zombie lovers out there.","July 16, 2014","true","109.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Zombies occasionally walk through walls, the clipping on certain objects is 'interesting' to say the least, and the controls are hard to get used to. But all the minor points aside, this game is hella fun.\n\nI completed my first playthrough in 16 hours, and I've barely touched the surface on everything I could do. Many, many more hours will be spent doing everything and going everywhere I can, whilst unlocking all the Steam achivements. It's the first single-player game that's gripped me this much for a long while, and a real killer in the zombie genre.\n\nI think it would be possible to play and survive in this game almost indefinitely - at least until you run out of certain resources, anyway. It was great fun to find and save and then play as other survivors at will, feeling a real sense of shame and disappointment when I unwittingly led one to their permanent death shortly afterwards. I've never played a game with such a persistent environment, and whilst the tutorial is lacking a lot, playing about on my own I realised there is SO much you can do.

It doesn't rely heavily on the "jumpscare" which I love. The game isn't soley built on fighting zombies. It's about surviving the long game. In order to succeed you need to scavange, set up outposts, upgrade your home base. You need to look for weapons for yourself, but also buidling, medical, food, and ammo supplies for your group to survive.\n\nYou need to manage relationships with other groups of survivors by rescuing them, or ignoring the pleas for help so you can run another mission that you need for supplies.\n\nYou need to manage your folks as well, playing as one character can hurt you in the long run, you need to play multiple folks and level them up as well. If your singlely played character dies you're in for a long tough road ahead.  The game does a great job reminding you of this as each player will fatigue when they've been outside the safe zone for too long, so you are reminded that you need to swap characters.\n\nThe best part is for a zombie survival game you dont' need to kill zombies. There are no drops, no added bonus to offing them, other than keeping you and your home safe, so hiding in bushes, or staying quiet to save ammo and mele weapons isn't peanized one bit.\n\nI'm 10 hours in and only feel like I"ve started. but I can't stop playing, everything else in my library sits idle while I contine to fight for the living.","January 25, 2014","true","20.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have not found any glaring faults as yet, though I do wish vehicles carried more items (a kitchen timer should not really take up the same space as a duffle bag in the back of a pickup truck) and that fully metal weapons, such as a pipe, lasted far, far longer than they do.\n\nDeaths are real, and as a character dies you are stuck with whomever is left. While that does not change the game itself, it does limit what you are able to do later in the game if you have not been working on all the available characters' skills. I consider this a bonus, as it prevents the game from getting boring.\n\nVehicle stability is reminiscent of Grand Theft Auto.

I had fun playing it, but it does It have some annoyances such as camp members who run off at random times, so even after you rescue and make friends with them they aren't available to switch to most of the time when you want to.  The length of the campaign is about 15-20 hours probably and that seems about right.

If you are to get the game just to kill zombies and just explore I recomend getting the Breakdown DLC. I spent most of my time on that. The story is alright but nothing too great.\nA small list of some pros and cons.\nPro- Some what classic zombie, they run but can only be killed by damaging the brain.\nPro- Great mechanics such as building up a base with survivors and gear to survive the hordes, a rouge like system that has you play as multiable characters but if he/she dies you can no longer play as him/her, cars will never respawn after you destroy them.\nPro. Different types of zombie found all over the map.\nPro- A large map that has many places to settle in and explore.\nPro- Many different types of weapons from melee to guns.\nCon- Zombies will glitch that causes them to not load in correctly so its just their head and arms.\nCon- (personal con) I dislike the survivor walking animation.\nCon- Survivor AI can glitch causes them to just stand still and die.\nCon- Sadly no co-op or multiplayer. I deeply wish they added that in.\n\nState of Decay is a pretty fun game, when your done with the base game you can always get the Breakdown DLC that makes the game harder and it ends when you die or the Lifeline DLC that ands a new map and a new story. :D","June 23, 2014","true","17.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

State of Decay is a game which is all about surviving a zombie apocalypse, but it has much more to it then you think.\n\nThe game is a lot like the walking dead, meaning When you first start out you find a group within an hour of playing the story. Then to help out the group you can do tasks like fetching supplies, or even helping out neighbours for rewards.\n\nYou can build utilities in your base, and even move bases later on in the game. If your neighbours trust you enough, they might even ask to join your group. You can also ask one of the main characters, Lilly Ritter to radio out to other survivors so they can join you, or ask if any other survivors know where food/weapons/ammo etc. can be found.\n\nSurvivors will lose hope in the group's survival, because it's still a zombie apocalyse and they're dead people trying to eat you, so you can talk to them about it and get them to blow off their steam while killing zombies or boost their esteem.\n\nThe weaponry in this game comes in different varieties, there's guns and melee weapons, but there's different types of them. for meleee weapons, there's blunt types, edged, and heavy weapons. For guns there's shotguns, snipers, handguns, and assault rifles (which are hard to find.)\n\nEach survivor has their own pros and cons, for example one could be a good shot, but is an alcoholic, which would determine the survivor's stats. In the game, there are six slots for your character's stats. The four stats which every survivor will have is fighting, cardio, shooting, and wits. The other two can be for anything special about the character. For example, the first survivor you start out with, Marcus is a physical powerhouse, meaning you should have him using heavy weapons like sledgehammers, (my personal favourite combo) and he's also a born leader, making him one of the (best survivors in the game hint hint.) Each of those stats can be leveled up to a maximum of seven, but starting at four you can choose a perk that you can also level up seven times. Starting at level four of fighting/shooting, you can specialize in a type of gun or a type of melee weapon then level up that specialization up to seven as well.\n\nThe fighting mechanics are pretty straightforward, if you use the rolling mechanic correctly you shouldn't actually have to use guns. There isn't that much of a story, but the game is mainly focused to surviving. The game can get kind of repetitive, but this game isn't actually in a completed state yet. This is one of my favourite games of all time, and I rate this 9/10.","August 8, 2014","true","78.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This will be one of your favourites that will go on your list of true zombie survival games. Note: all these prices are based on the presumption you are buying the game on sale\nSo if you have $ free:\n$20+: Definatly grab this\n$10-20: Grab this\n$5: As long as you are not saving up for anything grab this\n$0: I would suggest getting some more steam credit and buying this\n\n\n\nIF YOUR FAVOURITE GENRE IS SURVIVAL:\nThis will be a decent surival game that you will remember. It lacks the basic functions such as a hunger and a food bar. However it makes up in the fact that it requires you to gather neccasary resources, and has fatigue and sickness ( as well as a few others). Note: all these prices are based on the presumption you are buying the game on sale\nSo if you have $ free:\n$20+: Grab this, you will enjoy it\n$10-20: Nothing to run out for, only grab this if you have already played the major surivivals such as\ndayz, dont starve etc.\n$0- 5 If you are getting more game money soon then grab it, but dont go out of your way for just this\n\nIF YOU ENJOY BOTH SURVIVAL AND AND ZOMBIE GAMES:\nChuck what you were playing out the window and grab this!\n\nIF YOUR FAVOURITE GENRE IS SHOOTERS\nThis is not a shooting game! Dont think that for one second. It has guns however you wont be using them much and they have a very slow progression. If you want to try out the other 2 listed genres then grab this but not if your looking for a shooting game!\n\nIF YOU PLAY NONE OF THESE GENRES:\nThis is a good taste test for a zombie and survival game. It includes solid but not everwhelming gameplay, and should give you a good idea of wheather or not you like the genre. However if you have no urge to start playing zombie/ survival games then move on.\n\nI hope this different type of review helped, and give it a thumbs up if it did :)","November 7, 2014","true","33.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I recommend it to anyone who enjoys zombies, the combat and scavanging can get rather repetative, but the side missions and survivor tasks break it up nicely and are rather fun.  But the most unique thing about it is how they handle the character deaths.  When a character dies, they die.  You don't get a chance to reload before that happened and try again, you are moved to another survivor at your base and continue on.  I find it rather neat, if frustrating at times, since it makes it a lot more important to avoid zombie hordes when playing as the better survivors.","November 14, 2013","true","14.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When a character dies because of a bug or flaws in mechanics - this completely defeats the purpose of the game.

Having said that, there are a few ideas to be add to this awesome game that would make it, in my personal opinion, just that much better. Such as being able to place two extra ruck sacks of supplies you find into the trunk of a car for transport or four in the bed of a truck so that it isn't such a mind numbing task to drive half way across the map back and forth three or four times just to get all the supplies out of one house and back to your area of opereations. Also, maybe have the vehicles run out of fuel and have to be filled up by the use of gas cans you find around the world, so you can fill up on the go or use your fuel reserves you have stored up at your base. Maybe even have it so some of the gas stations still have a good amount of gas that you could take but say the power is out and you need to start up a generator to start the pumps but will also attract any nearby zombies, making the game more challenging so you don't just drive a car around the world just searching for supplies making you strategize how you use your precious fuel. But all and all this is one of the best zombie games I have ever played and I love it.

I decided to include the game in general.\n\nState of Decay is absolutely a must have for those who enjoy Zombie Apocalypse Simulators. The gameplay is fun, suspenseful and sometimes risks need to be taken to survive. When you have to fight zombies it's best to avoid the large groups because you WILL die, it's a problem you may have to deal with and sometimes you'll lose your favorite guy in the group. You will constantly need to restock on supplies especially after you come back, Things will happen even when you're not playing. I know because when I came back the next day there was three to five missions on my map and my supplies went down a couple digits.\n\nI enjoyed the campaign, it was interesting and it kept my imagination trying to figure out what was going on. There were times when the game deviated from the main plot but it wasn't too bad. There was also the deal with expendable cars, if you blow up a car it's gone for good. No reparing a dead car so if you can you should make the effort to avoid hitting large crowds of zombies or your vehicle will get bent out of shape.\n\nIn the Breakdown DLC you are basically playing in sandbox mode, at the start you pick a settlement with what little supplies you have and start where you want in a small area with very few survivors. You can just focus on survival, and there is also the part where if you are able to perform certain tasks you can gain special survivors. But when you're moving on to a higher difficulty in Breakdown you can only bring a handful of your survivors so choose carefully.\n\nI don't know much about Lifeline but I will say this, it's a refreshing change of scenery, literally. A whole new map, with a whole new storyline. It may be the same gameplay but I was surprised by how much was changed. There are some bugs but they're not game-breaking.\n\nI personally believe this game has alot of potential and with the new DLC I certainly believe Undead Labs is in the process of something great. Take my word for it when I say, if your a fan of Zombie games this one is a must.\n\n","May 31, 2014","true","160.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Put simply this is a fun game to jump into casually. It does however have its quirks albeit random such as driving into a horde only to have your car suddenly flip high into the sky. Character then tossed from the car only to land back down again amongst the horde and devoured…. Hmmm sad day, sad day. But this is a rarity and the regular updates help keep things balanced.\n\nThe randomness however equally appeals prolonging it’s game play from the immediate main quest. If I can make an extra recommendation, grab the DLC Breakdown. The DLC is essentially for those wanting more of a challenge after fleshing out the main game. It essentially jumps in after the prolog from the main game. In part it almost feels like a prequel minus the main quests. But it’s the DLC's infinite play that gets progressively harder that has its main appeal.","December 5, 2013","true","63.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
