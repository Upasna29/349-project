This game will have you stop to look at the beautiful scenery but have you running through some horrors and have you creep and crawl from the nightmares. For an early access game: Dream Delivers! This is definetly gonna be the game I keep my eye on with updates. The graphics and storyline are both fantastic and deliver some top quality gaming for anyone. You'd be a fool not to want to have this game in your Steam library.","November 27, 2013","true","8.8"," 279 of 304 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","279","304","0","0"

When I have a chance to try it I'll update what's merited.\n\n\nI hate to give this game a negative review since i've been waiting patiently for two years to play it fresh. Unfortunately this game cannot really be evaluated on its artistic merit due to numerous technical issues:\n\n- Lots of graphical tearing, despite vsync.\n- Several menu UI problems, many of them painfully obvious, such as inconsistent highlighting of menu options, confused/incorrect localization options, and even disclaimer text on the remapping menu explaining that it doesn't work correctly (!!)\n- Several in-game control problems, such as apparently incorrectly labelled keybindings. "F", for example, pops a console message, rather than the stated function of "using" an object. Small things like the loss of the mouse pointer when using the catacomb computer can be worked around or figured out but are still rather rough for a finished product. Maybe this is just me but when I found an item to pick up and put it my inventory, I had no idea how to find it again. Collision boxes are also rather rough-and-ready.\n- I had problems with the voice-overs. The initial house section seemed to "speak" correctly, but in the desert I was unable to hear any speech, although subtitles appeared from time to time. Even the subtitles had misprinted characters (possibly a localization issue? or related to the localization menu confusion?)\n\nOther issues are possible since I stopped playing just after the maze/light puzzles; if patches improve the experience I'll be back to finish it off.\n\nOn the positive side I found it pretty good-looking and it definitely has an interesting concept, one I've long been awaiting. But despite the long lead time in early access, this game is not really ready for a true release, particularly at this price. If you're interested in purchasing, I would wait a for a few patch cycles to address some of these problems.","July 31, 2015","false","1.0"," 584 of 710 people (82%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","82","584","710","24","12"

I got it with the discount on it, but i can say that if you pay for the original price, you'll be REALLY happy.\n\nThis game conteins things that i cannot explain, things that fits perfect like the combination of place - music. I'm a music student in the university and i can say that the "Dream OST" is SO GOOD that im actually learning it on piano.\n\nI feel very comfortable with the game in all the aspects, and i like that thing of making us collect pieces of paper that contains information about the meaning of these objects or things that we all have in our dreams.\n\n¿What about the nightmares? You'll see how much you can sweat with a good enviroment and the correct sounds in the perfect time.\n\nFor me, this game it worth what it cost, and i give Dream 4.5 Stars out of 5. Why? Because it's still on Alpha, maybe then i could give this game 5 stars when alpha finishes.\n\nThanks to the Devs for such a good experience :)","June 24, 2014","true","13.3"," 119 of 128 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","119","128","0","3"

Then, you will find yourself unable to move. Best way to do it without missing anything is to listen and respond to that phone call and wake up. Then, go to sleep again and find portal to get to the phone part again. This time you don't listen to the phone call to the end. You need to try to open the door in order to interrupt that phone call. Then, you shall continue to solve the puzzle.(Hint: the locked door is not a bug.)\n\nOk, let's talk about this game.\nFirst, the graphic is awesome. I really enjoy lots of scenes especially when I was playing in the garden part. That sunlight effect is great to me.\nSecond, the music is good. I have to say that I felt the music is too "musical" as BGM at the beginning. However, after I did some puzzles in the game, I found out that the music in this game are suitable for atmospheres of different parts and they also don't make you feel bored while you're trying solving puzzles.\nThird, gameplay is mostly about solving puzzles and exploring. Sometimes it's little bit hard to interract with objects since I could hardly see where I was aiming. However, I didn't find it too hard to do most of tasks.\nAt last, I could almost get the plots of this game and see the connection between dreams and reality. It's not hard to figure out what things in dreams represent and basically you could find that out just by following every single hints, dialogs and sentences on the walls.\nIn conclusion, it's a great game full of puzzles and explorations and IT'S STILL IN ALHPA. I would recommend my friends to try this game. It might not be interesting to everyone, but still with little patience, this could be one great experience during this Christmas, enjoying music, solving puzzles, and getting yourself into a  few-hours trip to different dreams full of memories and imagination.","December 27, 2013","true","4.1"," 123 of 146 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","123","146","0","0"

Not worth 17$.\n\nDream is a very interesting game with a very captivating concept.\nYou play as a man named Howard whose uncle recently passed away and you\nare a Dreamer. The majority of the game takes place in your (lucid) dreams.\nThese dreams involve exploration and puzzle solving, in a variety of environments.\n\nPros\n\n+Graphically most of this game looks ok\n+Outside environments are beautiful and very nice to look at\n+Inventory system has a very simplistic design that is easy to use and understand.\n+Voice acting is very crisp and clean, and nice to listen to.\n+Music is very well done\nCons\n\n-Howard's lines are very awkward and some things he says I think shouldn't be said explicitly\n-Hitboxes on some things are god-awful, especially the rocks in the desert level (some places you need to crouch to get through even if there is a five foot gap)\n-The "pop in" is terrible. The ground literally changes before your eyes\n-(This is just my opinion) Exploration is very tedious, I found myself using sprint as much as possible (because there is a godamn cooldown for who knows why?) because I found walking just, well slow. However this might be a personal problem especially because I like going superfast in rouglikes such as spelunky.\n-The four mazes in the desert level are very tedious. Doing the same thing four times in a row is just stupid. Yes the "perks" of each maze are all unique but it doesn't change the fact that it's just the same thing over and over.\n-I really hate this- thepuzzles have all been done before. Correct me if I'm wrong but I didn't find a single innovative puzzle in the entire game.\n-Player model is clunky and looks pretty bad, and shadows  are animated badly aswell.\n\nThough I don't really want to play anymore of this game based on what I've played so far I'm still watching how this early access title will play out. This is their team's first game, so it will be interesting how they will work things out and fix problems. If the cons I listed even are problems, and not just my own displeasure. Anyway try it out, but buy it on sale.","June 16, 2015","false","1.5"," 216 of 286 people (76%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","76","216","286","8","3"

The "gameplay" wasn't to my liking, but I played anyway because the game was just stunning to look at.\n\nNow, well...\n\nVisual quality has gone way down. LOD pop-in on textures and objects is VERY noticeable. There's very little difference between playing on the video settings maxed out and having them set on the lowest possible settings. Also, no difference in game performance (FPS) between max and min settings.\n\nTurning off bloom while looking at an object with bloom results in a bloom "ghost" staying on my screen until I changed resolution.\n\nGlitches galore! A number of key bindings simply do not work! They have a lengthy writeup in the corner of your bindings menu "explaining" what the hell is wrong with it.\n\nDialogue audio played when it felt like it. The subtitles showed that someone was talking, but nothing could be heard.\n\nPlant textures in the Guardian Quandry (first place you visit when you dream) were glitched out, as well as the background on the subtitles. See my screenshots for examples.\n\nThat's as far as I got with the game. I'm sure if I played further, I'll find even more things that were ruined.\n\nAt least the game was pretty before.","August 2, 2015","false","5.6"," 117 of 146 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","117","146","4","2"

It still runs pretty roughly, even on the lowest settings, and since the game is generally about taking in the beauty of the dreamworld it may still be pretty hard to enjoy it to the fullest. The game is still in pre alpha and I'm one hundred percent sure the devs will do everything they can to both deliver more great content and patches to make the game run a lot smoother, but these are simply minor downsides that can obviously be forgotten and resolved for a pre alpha title.\nSo, would I recommend it in its current state? Yes, I would, for a lower price. I got it for around 5.50€ and I don't regret anything. Dream creates a world of its own, with a dreamy world within the world where you dream.

The game runs smooth enough but some maps are just heavy for no reason and I get framerate drops even on a GTX 970. Visually the game is nice and has got some style.\n\nGAME ITSELF: Seeing that many bad reviews were not recommending the game because of controls problems....well, I got the game anyway because I knew I would have been able to fix controls or graphical issues. I was wrong, even after fixing everything, the game was working fine, started well enough....it definitely had some good moments and exceptional levels and puzzle BUT\n\nAND IT IS A BIG BUT(T):\n\nthe game does not deliver. The story is extremely simple and you can tell the meaning of the story from the first cutscene. The narration REPEATS itself every single time you complete a level, maybe to remember you the story every time from the beginning. Well, if you are like me and didn't forget anything about the story/narration, you will get stuck in front of the screen waiting for it to develop the story (because 90% of it, you already heard).\n\nDon't pay more than 3 euros for this. I would recommend it because we don't have many walking simulators, the game was nice enough although surely not a masterpiece, some puzzles were extremely entertaining, some other were making me fall asleep. I have to say though that the developer never bothered replying on the forum, everybody was complaining about the controls, I was just lucky to be able to edit the config files and fix them. The subtitles show grammar, spelling and syntax mistakes. This should not happen, if a developer invested enough time in the game development.\n\nP.S. I played basically every other walking simulator out there.....I like the kind of game, I would put a neutral review for this if it were possible. Just be sure not to pay too much for this one, and don't expect a masterpiece. Simply, Ether One or Gone Home or whatever, they are on a total different level in both visual quality, narration and plot.

He himself wants to become an author, but he keeps staying in the shadow of his uncle. Because of he's not very successfull in his life, he often falls back into his dreams. The mainstory is about his familys past and the last speech he had with his uncle. In the begining you get a short preview of the whole speech. Now it's your turn; discover the dreams of Howard and solve the riddles you get in there, to relive the speech on your own.\nSince the story is somehow monotone at some points, I can only give 6/10.\n\nThe Gameplay:\n\nSince the story is based on solving riddles, the gameplay is kept pretty simple:\nClassic WASD-Controlled walking\nSome ducking and jumping\nInteraction with objects via left-click or a bound key\nBut, like in Portal, it is not a negative aspect, because this game is based on solving riddles.\nWhile discovering your dreams, you feel a bit like in the movie "Inception", because in this movie the also use the so called "luzid dreaming", while moving around in the dreams of others.\nIn addition it is a lot of fun, seeing the dream worlds change, the more you solve the riddles.\nAll in all I give an 8/10 for the gameplay.\n\nThe Graphics:\n\nI don't want to do a graphic analysis, because this game doesn't want to impress with awesome 4K-textures or bombastic real-/quicktime-events. But the graphics part is always a part of a complete review.\nThe graphics are very balanced at all. The worlds are 67% made of repeating textures, but these are very detailed. The textures, that are important for the riddles, are very lovely designed. A picture frame, that makes an impression of a glass-made front and a wooden backside, or a clipboard, where even the clip is well textured, are aspects that make a game deserve commendation.\nAll in all, I have to lower one's sight, because of the repeating textures in bigger areas.\nTherefore, it is still a solid 7/10.\n\nPro & Contra:\n\nPro:\nWell done merging of Portal and Inception\nOne one hand you have relaxing riddles and on the other hand you have very hard ones\nLovely designed (dream-)worlds\nVery clear atmospheric difference between the different worlds\n\n\nContra:\nGamesound is too low even on maximum, as long as the background music is turned on\nSome small collision-bugs\nMinimal graphic-bugs in some situations\n\n\nMy Result:\n\nBased on the numbers, I get a 7/10 for this game. But since it has a lot of little aspects, that are very positive, I incline a bit more to 8 so I want to give 7,5/10.\n\nI got a Steamkeyfor review purpose.\nThis review was written as a valuation inside of its own genre.\n\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","December 19, 2015","true","3.2"," 101 of 140 people (72%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","72","101","140","7","4"

For a while I loved DREAM and it still is a great game. Good enough that I still recommend it. The premise is a fantastic and unusual one for a video game: Lucid Dreaming. As a result this opens so many doors to how creative and fun the game can be. For its already existing good points, DREAM is filled with quality. The environments are stunningly detailed and beautiful and even more enjoyable to explore given the non-linear design of the game. Puzzles are varied and at times really challenging to accomplish. As you wander in Howard's dreamland your ears are bombarded with some beautiful and appropriate music. Added together, these things highlight significant promise for the developers' ambition. Overall, I commend them for taking a brave turn in development in this unique setting.\n\nHOWEVER, there are a few negative points that really need addressing:\n\n- I must be honest with the story. It's really not as good as it could have been. Though the premise is fitting enough, as it focuses on a lonely young man whose life seems futile and non-progressive, and depends on the ability to lucid dream in order to find reason to live. And that simplicity is completely OK if it can be executed well. You'd think it could given that it focuses on the psychological/dream world which opens the ability to produce so much depth and surreal interpretation for an otherwise basic plot. Unfortunately it doesn't utilize that potential. I know it's an indie game made by a very small and inexperienced team, but it still would have been nice to have more in the way of mystery and reason that is not all that well-developed. Things might change in the final release once the (various) endings become available but until then, I can't laud the story too much.\n\n- Though it is an early access game, the controls are really terrible. It's easy to get stuck in weird places and it makes some of the already challenging puzzles even harder to accomplish. For the setting of an inner subconscious world I would expect one to feel more "free" in their experience and gameplay. I would have forgiven the clunky feel if the game still took some advantage of "freedom" like adding some flying sections (a large domain of lucid dreaming) instead of constantly walking/running around and doing too many physically basic 'waking life' routines. Additionally, the nightmares are a bit lacking. Though they have good atmosphere and some appropriately bizarre design they just feel more like anxious thoughts than actual *nightmares*. There is no danger to the player and they always take place in the same area which wouldn't be a problem were there more variation in added environmental designs. Given that the nightmares are the major point in the game's storytelling they don't provide nearly as much sense of horror and progression as I would have liked.\n\nI applaud the team for tackling a project like this, particularly as their very first! And the game is still worth buying if you wish to support the game and developers. As excited as I am that there's a game that takes on the subject of lucid dreaming with a very ambitious focus, its current form makes it difficult for me to give a high rating for the time being (higher than 7/10). I'm sure my review will change as the game further improves. In fact, I still encourage you to get it if you are interested as it's full of potential! Just for the time being it hasn't quite reached it yet.\n\n72/100","February 25, 2015","true","12.3"," 59 of 76 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","59","76","2","2"

The game appealed to me because I share that interest with the main character. The dreamscapes you explore are all very distinct and filled with moderately challenging puzzles. The nightmares are scary because of their atmosphere, which is enhanced by the music. I did find some creepy things outside of the nightmares as well, which ultimately makes sense because dreams do not adhere to the rules of the waking world. Still, it was very worth to keep playing, because in the end this game is just beautiful.\n\nOne minor remark: There's some bugs left at the time of writing which interfere with completing all achievements.

It is really unique and different and it caught my attention. There are puzzles and horror elements, but I wouldn't call it a horror game - the horror elements mainly occur in the nightmares, which are separate "missions", if you will. Other dreams are peaceful and quite beautiful. What I like about the visuals is the weather effects - walking in a snowy terrain for example feels very real and detailed. That being said, the textures of the different objects aren't really high definition, so don't expect it to look like Skyrim.\n\nHowever, it's the mysterious nature of things that really gets to you and makes able to immerse yourself in the world and story.\n\nReally looking forward to see how this game goes on as it doesn't have that much content right now (although having played for 4 hours, I still haven't played through all of it yet).

You basically play as this guy who sleeps and then has these dreams about things along with possible nightmares as well.  This is not a scary game, although there may or may not be a moment where something is watching you ;) but it's more of a "deeper meaning" type of game.   One of the neat aspects of it, is the level of detail in terms of explaining what does it mean when you see certain things in a dream, like what does it mean if you see snow, or a desert, or candle, or even caves.   I have a very very basic knowledge about psychology and I can say that a few of the things used in here describing the meaning of a dream, are accurate, but others, I can't say since I did not go that far into it in college.\n\nOverall, this game is really unique and a fun casual game to play.  The developer is still active with the community and has updated it with minor things, and even updates based off the holiday, which is cool.   I think there is still a good amount of work that can be done to add to the game and there were a few minor issues with lag during the part where there is snow.   Also, it can be really easy to get lost and not know what to do next, which is where I am at, and with little wlakthroughs online, it's difficult.   I say get this if you enjoy casual games that have deep meanings behind it and enjoy learning and exploring the science behind what is a Dream.","January 4, 2014","true","13.4"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","1"

You play Howard, a man with a over active imagination and recurring dreams. You guide Howard as he goes through these dreams and solves puzzles and begins to unravel the mystery of his own mind. What makes Dream so unique is that the narrative and path you take is up to you. There are many paths to choose from and each them weirder then the last. There are many details in the game that make it's story and universe rich. Along the same lines of Gone Home, you can pick up items and learn more about Howard and the houses former tenant. However, this is far from just some simple walking simulator. (even though I don't think that's a bad name/genre) There are several puzzles that keep you involved in the games story and makes you feel like an active participant, even if you don't know necessarily what is going on. Dream is gorgeous in design, music, and sound, it's game that must be experienced to truly understand. The tone of game can shift in seconds, as every dream, can be become a nightmare. This tonal shift keeps you on edge and makes the game feel suspenseful.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dravvad/recommended/229580/","Dravvad","Dravvad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dravvad/","218 products in account","One of the only games I've gotten via Early Access just because of how interesting it seemed. And of course, it had to let me down.\n\nI understand the premise - I mean, come on, the title - the game is meant to be a collection of off-the-wall areas to explore that escape reality due to your character dreaming. However, the developers seemed to take that premise and pretty much stop there. They ran as far as they could with making it generic odd dreams (and nightmares). In each dream, you find these scrolls which attempt to explain certain dream symbols and meanings, but most of the time they are just very generic meanings (and sometimes they talk about multiple meanings) and do not actually attempt to explain anything relative to your character or the game itself. They are literally as if you had just gone searching the web for dream object meanings, which of course vary all over the place and aren't exactly solidified.\n\nSo there is not really much of a story to the game; not much connects together. It's simply the randomness thrown together. You explore places that are basically just meant to say "Hey, the character feels lost or bored or confused!" Nothing is really sensible nor do things link together much. You find a handful of items throughout the dreams but they are entirely useless - you do almost nothing with them. The scrolls are mentioned above. And besides that, you wander around and then solve puzzles.\n\nNow, when it comes to those puzzles, they are all also very boring and nothing exactly fun or interesting to work through. For instance, the entire first dream can be completed very quickly if you stumble upon the mazes and just waltz around in them in a bored manner. You get chased after by some weird mist-like manifestions, but all they do is transport you outside of the mazes and have you go back in. So you just keep running around until you trigger a bunch of lights to turn off - and you repeat for 4 mazes. Once done, the dream is technically over and you can leave. For the second dream, the puzzles there are scattered, like the difficult-to-see laser tile puzzle, or the planet puzzle, but still nothing really fun. Essentially, all of the puzzles are very tedious and boring.\n\nThe dreams themselves are also nothing that special really. Graphics-wise, they definitely look really nice in many places, and at first they seem like something interesting to go through (I mean, I got the game based on the looks and general premise mainly - to expore!), but then you realize that there isn't much to them. Same generic areas but with slightly different objects, mainly used to lay things out like the scrolls. Now, there are side dreams that you can actually go into, but for the most part, these are also lackluster. For instance, the roller coaster dream is literally nothing at all. There's one that is like M.C. Escher with stairs that would've probably been way more interesting if you could have changed the gravity/orientation and walked up stairs in different angles. But instead, you just remain on the floor and tediously search for openings in the walls and climb up the highest stairs possible, ignoring nearly everything else in the rooms.\n\nEssentially, most of the dream world is simply boring to go through, even if you try to relax by just wandering. And as said above, while there are some nice graphics in the game, there are also a lot of places where the game simply drops that and turns them into blocky white areas or places that are just bleak, dull, and some single color without actual atmosphere.\n\nRelative to the style of the game, there's also the sound and music, which is alright. Some areas do have some nice music that partially plays, but there are also some that have a lot of annoying noise or quietness (which does not really emit any emotion). You also have the character narrating the game, which actually ended up bothering me a lot, and I did not expect that happening at all. He just says completely random things, or will read text that pops up out of nowhere in the dreams, so his talking serves almost no purpose.\n\nThen you have what a lot of people seem to complain about: bugs/glitches. The performance of the game definitely isn't the best, as I had a lot of lag when I really shouldn't have. Your motion can sometimes noclip through things, and certain places (e.g., the roller coaster mentioned earlier) bounce through objects in unsensible ways. In terms of actual bugs with the gameplay, I encountered some, but not as many as others. I had the computer in the first dream glitch out and freeze up, and I had certain puzzles not mark themselves as complete despite really being finished. Some other random issues here and there occurred, and sometimes I had to exit and restart, but the game didn't entirely prevent me from continuing like has happened for some others.\n\nEven worse, the developers seem to have disappeared and not bothered to do any more work, which many customers are complaining about.\n\nAll in all, a lot of things just seemed rather clumsy. The developers seriously took advantage of the "dream" premise itself - way more than they should have - and used it as a reason to just create a random, jumbled mess. The general idea is for a lot of it to have meaning and distinct symbolism, which they only threw around in pieces to seem like they were doing something. There's some very slight context here, but not developed in any way.\n\nA big letdown.","May 10","false","10.4"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

The best thing in this game - MUSIC. Sad to say, Dream was a big dissapointment for me. Explorating the dreams and finding hidden paper notes with real meanings of them was quite exciting, but after a while I found myself annoyed and tired of walking and solving weird puzzles...not because puzzles here are too hard for me, they just lack of something that would made me stay with this game for longer. Maybe I will comeback to this later and change my opinion, for now it's just a annoying exploration game.

The current market is filled with "dreamy" experimental titles which actually stimulate thought and communicate with the player's sub-conscious.\nJourney, Neassance, Rememored, Flower, Nevermind, The Beginner's guide ecc...while DREAM feels like a newcomer with no skills trying to fit into a market he doesn't know well, and tries to lure the masses in with the overused stereotype of the "Introvert guy with social anxiety who battles with his self-esteem", without making it interesting.\nFor something that really speaks at a subconscious and is incredibly intense i'd strongly recommend "The Beginner's Guide" (From the author of "The Stanley Parable").\nLast downside of DREAM is the fact it's unpolished. You occasionally glitch out, the ambient occlusion is too strong (making the visuals worse) and some effects and animations are missing.\nThis game was a real let-down. If you like GOOD games belonging to this "genre" you can check the titles i've written above.","January 2","false","3.9"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","16","22","0","0"

The official position of the developer is, that they will implement support for newer VR headmounted displays as soon as the engine they are using gets updated ... and that's the problem: This game was made in UDK. Epic, the developer of UDK, clearly stated that UDK won't get any updates EVER again. The developer of Dream knows this and is thus, by not removing the "VR Support" entry from the feature list, deliberately deceptive.\n\nThe only positive thing that 'can' be said in this regard is, that the thread where I wrote about this problem months ago was not deleted or locked and I wasn't banned from the forums. So in some minimal regard they are better than some other developers of UDK games, who formerly planned to implement VR support, still want to use it as a selling point and actively suppress any statement of the impossibility of such VR support ever being implemented on their forums.\n\nFor me however the fact that the VR support tag remains combined with the genre of this game (releasing a 1st person exploration game in this day and age means, that VR support is practically mendatory) is enough to not recommend Dream, as much as I'd like to give it a positive rating, since it 'seems' to be a nice game. I however cannot bring myself to play such a game on a normal monitor anymore.","July 21, 2015","false","0.4"," 30 of 48 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","30","48","2","3"

The game is still in early access, so things I mention here may not be true in the future.\n\nFrom the get-go, the game looks, feels, and sounds amazing.  I am big on music in games and the soundtrack blew me away when you enter your first dream, it is absolutely beautiful.  The graphics aren't top notch but they still look amazing, I find myself wandering around through the different dream sequences just taking in the design.\n\nNow as far as playing the game, basically you are exploring different dream sequences and solving puzzles within them.  The puzzles so far are really good, they may seem ambiguous at first but they are easy enough to understand once you start doing them (Sometimes listening to the main character speak will give a hint to the puzzle).  They still take some time to complete though, but I'd discourage using guides to solve the puzzles, it feels really good to solve one on your own :D.\n\nGiven that the game is still in early access, there are some thing that I feel could be improved upon.  Although I discourage a guide for solving the puzzles, it almost seems necessary to use one to find your way to the next one.  Figuring out where to go is a nuisance, it's cool running around and taking in the scenery but it gets real boring after a while and you just want to move on with the game.  "Moving on" with the game though isn't always clear though, what I mean is, for example, there was one point where I finished a puzzle, then it just brought me back into the bedroom, it was as if I completed the puzzle but nothing happened!  No indication that anything had changed, no indication of where to go next, nothing.  Figuring out where to go would probably be a lot better if the opening the map wasn't such a chore (It's almost as annoying as Zelda's Adventure for the CDI, if you watch AVGN you know what I mean), a simple hotkey that pops open the map would be much better rather than going through your inventory...at least if there is a simple way to open the map I haven't figured it out yet, adding to the game's ambiguity right now.\n\nThere were two bugs I encountered in this game, one was during a puzzle my character got stuck and I wasn't able to move, causing me to have to "wake up" in the menu and have to start the puzzle over again.  Another was when I had moved through a portal into a dream sequence, the game crashed.  I didn't lose much progress though.\n\nEven though there are a couple bugs and the game is pretty ambiguous, I would still highly recommend it to everyone, it is a great game with huge potential and I know it will only get better.  For all I know the ambiguity is intended, after all, how many dreams have you had that weren't ambiguous?","January 5, 2014","true","6.7"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

I can't exactly put my finger on it. Maybe it's the puzzles which can be kind of "ehh" at times. Or it might be the fact I wasn't really sure what to do. I felt like I was just wandering around and would end up at a dead end or back where I started. Of course the game isn't done, so they could fill in the empty space which this game has a lot of.\n\nSome levels are cool like when it suddenly turns into a horror game and you're put into this creepy enviorment inside your house, but then there's levels like the huge buisness building with the pipes all around where there's just nothing to do but walk around and find the end. It is possible it was a bug and I wasn't supposed to be there.\n\nOverall the game has potential to be really good. The developers just need to kind of smooth out the edges in terms of fun or interesting gameplay. I haven't been able to beat the game because of a game breaking bug where I'm trapped, so this review isn't from the most experienced person.","March 20, 2015","true","2.0"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","17","25","0","0"

Along the way some people close to the devs passed out and the game entered a long hiatus of no updates & etc, that may have caused some people to hate on the game and probably send some negative reviews so ignore most of those please.\n\nAnyways gladly, the devs came back after a while and they focused 100% on the game, i've never seen a team so focused on update a single game like the devs of Dream, and oh god, it payed off every second.\n\nFrom someone who watched this game grow from just an interesting concept/game to a masterpiece, i highly suggest you buying it. And for the devs,  thank you so much for making this game.\n\n\ntl;dr/mandatory ratings\nGraphics : 9,\ngosh this game almost beat Mind : Path to Thalamus, i was starstruck from the beggining to the end, its a very charming game and it feels smooth af. Some people had some problems with framerate but they fixed it already.\n\nGameplay : 10\nWell, its solid and the puzzles are simple,  not repetitive  and most of the times but it can be hell.\n(Yes graveyard puzzle, i'm lookin @ u rn).   Well its a puzzle game so i guess i couldnt expect less. Also i was happy to notice that the devs added a sprint key, it makes the game so less frustrating when you have to walk gigantic mazes. (graveyard i'm still looking at u)\n\nAudio : 9\nI wanted to talk about this in particular because i dont know how 3 people in a small indie studio could make such a pleasant soundtrack/voice acting? Howard is quiet most of the time but the dialogue of the game itself is so well made, and there wasnt a single soundtrack i didnt fell in love with.  Right out of the start the jukebox music touched my heart so bad.  The only problem is that there's a puzzle that you cant really hear much of what Howard is saying and you have to really focus, if it wasnt because of that, the audio would get a 10/10 rate\n\nOverall : 10 The game is just another really good/hidden gem game, but to be able to see this game grow and to see the devs try everyday to make it work and improve it made this one of my favorite games on steam. And devs, again,  Thank you so much for making this game.","August 13, 2015","true","4.4"," 21 of 33 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","21","33","3","4"

Since the story of Dream is still a work in progress, I'll overlook it and describe the aspects of the game that I was capable of gathering in my sporadic attempts to play the game for more than a 10 minute period.\n\nDream has extraordinary graphics complements of Unreal 3, which makes Dream just wonderful to look at and is complemented by an absolutely breath taking soundtrack. Because of this; Dream is very appealing to the visual and auditory senses and creates such an attractive potential for a spectacular experience. From what I could gather in the tragically short amount of time the games current build was willing to yield to me, you explore the dreams of the protagonist which begin in a central hub of his inner mind, travelling to different dreams through gateways which always crashes for me whenever I attempted to enter.\nAside from the crashes, Dream also needs work in multiple other areas as well. The afformentioned hub is difficult to navigate on account of it's monotonous white colors and lack of shading, being just short of a solid white screen.\nThe main menu also lacks control binding, which is relatively minor in an exploration game like Dream but is just something I personally prefer to glimpse at and tweak with prior to playing.\n\nSo while Dream has such amazing potential, it's current Alpha build isn't exactly in a very fit state to be sold and I'm honestly curious as to why the developers released it as it is (I am very skeptical of the applications for Steam's Early Access program).\nIf you're interested in picking up Dream, I suggest you simply keep it on your watchlist until it is complete.","December 29, 2013","true","2.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","1"

If you do not have the highest end computer do not turn away to such a wonderful game, give it a shot because it works fine on my crappy laptop! (And if not you can always refund :D) It is definitely worth it the price, considering how much work the devs have put into it.\n\nAs for the gameplay it is very puzzle orientated, but I do not believe that the puzzles are too difficult and many of the harder ones have guides so it's not too tough to progress. If you love challenging yourself while appreciating beautiful landscape around you, then this is the game for you.\n\nAs for the issues with the game itself, I too have grown quite tiresome of them, the game indeed did run better during early access, but hey its Hypersloth's FIRST game, heck look at DayZ Standalone the game barely runs and no one complains about it. The devs have answered many questions concerning issues and in just one day have fixed MANY of the problems. However I do wish the developers were more active in responding, I've sent many emails for help and even made 3 different posts in discussions for help with no response. I understand they can be busy, but it gets annoying to see other problems being addressed and the ones I have not.\n\nBut overall this game is a must try and I recommend it to anyone with a curious mind!","August 1, 2015","true","21.7"," 25 of 43 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","25","43","3","2"

Oct. 31 is my bday, and buying this during the sale was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ good decision. First of all, i congratulate the developers. They launched the game a few days ago, after some years of developing, and they did a fantastic job. They listened to the community and didnt abandon the game, fixing bugs and hearing suggestions, unlike many other Early Acess developers did in their projects. Dream is a game unlike any other. You can relate to other games, of course, like Gone Home or Dear Esther, but Dream has that factor that makes the game rather unique. I dont know if its the atmosphere, the story or even the soundtrack, this game nails it. The puzzles can be quite hard without a guide, which can be frustrating but rewarding. There are lots of things you can explore in the game, if you enjoy exploring, you will love this game. I wont spoil the story, but i can guarantee its nice. The graphics are excellent.\nI really enjoyed playing Dream during Early Acess, and now that the game is officialy launched, im ready to play all over again and enjoy this beautiful experience.","January 28, 2014","true","11.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It's just not engaging to solve a puzzle by running through lights in a maze. It'd be forgiveable if it was just once but we have to do it four times. It's not a good enough concept to deserve that much time and attention. It's as if the devs fell too deeply in love with their maze idea and nobody had the guts to tell them it's not that great.\n\nHere's some constructive feedback:\n1: Get rid of 3 of the maze stages. I know that's a lot of hard work down the drain, but please just do it. Allowing players to skip it with a penalty isn't a good enough reason for the devs to bypass a conceptual flaw.\n2: Fix the glitch in the surveillance stage where activating the door while the guy on the phone is still talking cuts off his speech.\n3: Remove the screen bounce entirely. It's more distracting than immersive.\n4: Make the sprint button more reliable. Using sprint was a gamble as to whether or not it would work.\n5: Pie in the sky: start the experience with a mystery. It can be as simple as one still image at the beginning showing a hint about what's going to happen. Bait us. Give us something to discover throughout the course of the game.

The voice acting is more fluid, I know the characters better because of the little conversations in between and during dreams. As a young adult who will inherit property someday, I'd never thought a game could put my hesitance and challenges into words like this game does.\n\nThe music is wonderful, creative and sometimes a little bittersweet. I've never enjoyed a soundtrack more. The graphics are beautiful, so much in fact that I sometimes play just to take a peek at the rolling desert sand. The storyline makes this game a gem in a plethora of crappy indie games. The humor is kind, in fact, the entire game is kind. You never feel rushed unless playing a nightmare, and even then you're free to explore as much as you want.\n\nThe only thing that needs a little improving are the puzzles. They can be frustrating and almost nonsensical sometimes, but otherwise, 8.5/10","October 7, 2015","true","14.1"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","11","17","2","0"

You travel through three thematically unconnected areas, each of which eventually lead back to a 'nightmare' version of the house you begin in. After each 'nightmare' - featuring such startlingly original imagery as creepy dolls and threatening messages appearing in blood on the walls - is completed you hear an additional portion of the conversation at the start of the game. Along the way you can visit brief diversions known as 'side dreams', which again bear no thematic relevance to anything, and which occasionally 'reward' you with an inventory item, none of which do anything of note. 90% of the time your inventory is completely extraneous, as puzzles are solved using the environment exclusively.\n\nWhat is the point of all this? What does a desert, a bizarre business's HQ, a holiday resort, a theme park, or any of the other crap you encounter have to do the protagonist's desire to become a writer? Why do I need to turn off lights in a maze, sort out vacationers' meal orders or connect a bunch of lasers to progress in the game? This is not symbolic of anything. It's not deep and meaningful, no matter how many vacuous Cliffs Notes about dream symbology the devs want to cram in. These are just arbitrary roadblocks between the player, and hearing the remainder of a none-too-interesting conversation.\n\nI kept waiting for the denouement that would tie it all together, but it never arrived. This game would have been better served by completely foregoing its sorry excuse for a narrative and just providing each section without any context beyond that of being a puzzle game. The title would still be resoundingly mediocre, but at least it wouldn't be pretentious to boot.","March 26","false","10.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

If things get fixed I will update this review.\n\nUpdate to review:\n\nWell thanks to rogermorse I was able to have working controls. It's still a knock on the game though as the developer should be doing this not the community. After getting working controls I had the game lock up on my about 4 times.

It is clearly aiming to be some kind of exploration into the psyche of the main character, called Howard, by trying to be something thought-provoking and intellectual. But it fails miserably to accomplish even that one simple task for two reasons.\n\nFirstly, there is lack of creativity here that is so pronounced that even the designer felt that they needed to label significant things and explain them. Floating text frequently appears at key points-of-interest within the environments to explain what this thing you are looking at represents. There is also scraps of paper, supposedly from a Dream Dictionary, which you can find in places if you explore. What this reminds me of is when someone tells you a joke that is so lame that they have to explain it to you afterwards.\n\nSecondly is the complete lack of anything enjoyable to do in the dreams, since most tasks are simply mundane puzzles which are only difficult due to how long they take as a result of setbacks from mistakes. You won't have any 'eureka' moments here since the solution to the puzzles are obvious. The Dreams aren't visually interesting either causing you to not really want to bother exploring and at other times they clearly aren't intended for exploration anyway. I'm not joking here, but there is a dream where you go onto a very slow roller-coaster ride around a smoky-grey room and do nothing for a good 5 minutes. Another is when you walk around an empty office building just looking for how to get out unless you happen to notice a pc you can access using passwords written on a clipboard from the ground-floor. This gives you some puzzles and rewards you with access to a "Nightmare" that is so unimpressive that I actually felt cheated out of the time I spent solving the puzzles.\n\nIf Dream is trying to convey that Howard is depressed, bored with life and has no sense of direction or purpose then it accomplishes this goal with huge success... because the game itself is also boring, lacking direction and creativity.","November 22, 2014","false","0.4"," 22 of 40 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","22","40","0","3"

Every single word he utters is maddeningly pathetic. He's excruciatingly lame; a space where a personality should be. I eventually started to hope that the nightmares would consume him, because at least that would make him sort of interesting.\n\nSo... why am I recommending this game? Because, amazingly, if you're able to look past a few bugs, a clunky interface, and the fact you're playing as Howard, then there's actually a genuinely interesting experience to be had here. The world design is seriously beautiful, and the puzzles are - for the most part - very well designed (if a bit on the easy side). Most importantly, the developers have done a fantastic job of translating dream experiences into meaningful gameplay mechanics and level design. Everything feels *almost* coherent, but constantly falling apart. Meaning always seems to be scattered around, just within your reach, but you can never quite grasp it. Symbols and items repeat themselves throughout each dream and nightmare in a semi-ordered yet mostly disjointed fashion. All of this is very well done, and generally leads to a great gaming approximation of dreaming.\n\nSo yeah, despite its obvious flaws, it's a beautiful and unique experience which I'd heartily recommend... if you can forget you're playing as Howard.","August 8, 2015","true","19.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jbobw/recommended/229580/","jbobw","Bob","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jbobw/","247 products in account","This game genuinely makes me feel ill. I think it is probably the way the screen sways that makes me feel sick; even when you are standing still the screen sways slightly (this is most noticeable when interacting with small objects) which causes various objects to flicker at the edges as they get redrawn. The other factor is that may be contributing is the excessive use of blurring, objects a moderate distance away are blurry and the game uses even more blur and distortion at points of the game e.g. at level transitions. Whatever the cause it is really difficult to look favourably on a game that I can only play for short periods of time without risking losing my lunch.\n\nThe game is mostly a wandering about then solving very arbitrary feeling puzzles. After completing a level you are rewarded by being made to listen to the protagonist emotionlessly moan about his first world problems for a bit. The game is relatively short with only three core levels which felt uninspired. I've said this before about Dreamkiller when you set you game in a dream you have a wonderful opportunity to design levels that break the normal rules of reality but the game failed to take advantage of that with the exception of the side dream based on Escher's Relativity, that was excellent.\n\nIt is difficult to say how much my opinion of the underlying game was coloured by how ill it made me feel but I don't think I could recommend this game even without the nausea.","March 26","false","9.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Each dream presents a variety of challenging puzzles you must complete to develop your sense of self-worth, while nightmare scenarios serve to haunt you with your own insecurities.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/grimmyfc/recommended/229580/","grimmyfc","Grimmy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/grimmyfc/","216 products in account","Dream is quite the interesting game. At its core, it's supposed to be a first-person interactive story adventure game, much like Gone Home or The Vanishing of Ethan Carter. If you go into experiencing Dream with that mindset, you'd expect it to have a captivating story and memorable characters. Unfortunately, Dream falls flat in that category with a story that's pretty unfulfilling and the main character, Howard, won't ever really grab your attention.\n\nNow if you can look past the subpar story, then Dream is a pretty neat experience. Like others have said, it has absolutely stunning environments and its soundtrack fits the game perfectly. The puzzles range from easy to perplexing (I'm looking at you conveyor belt!), but they're all satisfying when you finally complete them. Yes, some of them might be familiar if you're a fan of puzzle games, but they fit in with the game and is a nice way of adding gameplay to the exploration.\n\nIt's just a shame really that you don't learn more about Howard, or want to care about him at all throughout the game. Anything to stir emotion is better than none - but you'll walk away forgetting who Howard was or what role he even played in the game. I'd prefer if the game made me hate him or love him, but it made me feel apathetic towards him.\n\nThe game is non-linear and has multiple endings, and I recommend not rushing through it because the "default" ending is pretty bland. Take your time and explore everything that HyperSloth built out in the game and it's a pretty enjoyable experience, albeit not very memorable.\n\nYou can read my full review on Dream at: http://www.fullcleared.com/2015/08/17/dream-pc-game-review-wild-imagination/","August 17, 2015","true","7.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

I'm not sure where I picked Dream up, but the narrative and dialogue hooked me right away, and the simple gameplay and gorgeous world were enough to keep me there and the weird and interesting rewards for exploring brought it up a level. Unfortunately it also frustrated the hell out of me and felt rushed and incomplete at stages, especially because of some jarring technical problems which are actively difficult to avoid in certain areas. Fortunately due to the non-linear nature of Dream and because of the casual gameplay, these problems are only as apparent as the sections they're found in, and can be mostly ignored if so desired.\n\nHighlights\nDream differs from most games in it's genre by not sticking to a linear path, and instead offering the player the ability to approach whatever they like after the initial segment. This gives a casual hands-off approach to exploration and puzzles that means revisiting the game lowers any frustrations it has, and keeps it pleasant. It's also a very good looking title, and the tone, atmosphere and theme for each section and subsection is done well. The clever writing help out too and all combine fairly well.\n\nThe puzzles are a mixed bag of really quite fun to bloody laborious and frustrating, but overall they're mostly engaging and with a fair pay off which again is helped by the clever writing and steady narration.\n\nMistakes & Annoyances\nWhile there are some very minor issues I found with annoying level design or small graphical problems, they're all negligible and don't take away from the game at all and the only issue with Dream from a gameplay standpoint was that it was often far too ambiguous, vague or lacking in showing the player how to progress and I found myself looking up a guide or walk through rather than being able to deduce from my surroundings or steps so far how to accomplish something. I understand that the nature of the game is meant to be soft and ambiguous to fit in with the dreamlike nature, but when that makes it harder rather than easier for the player to establish a foothold on the games good points, it's simply bad design.\n\nThe main complaint however, is the technical problems, and it's a shame that it's such a meaty complaint that harms the game overall.\n\nThe one I had most troubles with, and probably the biggest complaint from the community involves a particular level where interacting with movement control hubs is either slow and misaligned or simply flat out broken. The cursor routinely disappears when interacting with computer terminals and causes issues. Oculus Rift support is all but an afterthought, and is currently completely broken. I ran into one instance where I jumped out of an elevator and found a secret hidden floor that I thought was a really cool setup for a level; instead after falling down a tunnel for 5 minutes I realized it was a level design glitch and I wasn't even supposed to be there, and there are countless other bugs and problems others have had I haven't approached.\n\nThere have been consistent updates from the developers addressing technical problems with Patch 1.1 in particular addressing keybindings, collision, menu items and more. It's just a shame there are still so many issues and that the time needed to polish and patch this game was never given throughout development.\n\nRecommendations\nAt £12.99/15.99€/$16.99, Dream is probably fairly priced, but given the availability of alternatives and titles of the same ilk, it's not great value for money if you're weighing your options. Both NaissanceE and The Stanley Parable, for comparison, more linear but slightly similar titles with equally attractive visuals and more polish, and I'd argue much more engaging overall, are around 25% cheaper and so probably better purchases when choice matters.\nThe soundtrack is worth pointing out as being good, but like the game, it's quite mellow and ambient, and justifying half the cost of the game again isn't realistic. If on sale, it may be better value for money.\n\n* There's a great explanation and commentary on the soundtrack by the creator here on Dreams' website which is worth a read for the music fans[dreamthegame.co.uk]\n* The original pre-Kickstarter thread with the concept of Dream from the devs is still up on reddit here\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/229580\n\nUnedited review notes 09/09/2015 for Dream:\n\n+Blurring of reality and dreams is nice and soft\n+Great looking worlds and environments\n+More content than you realize, nightmares & side dreams etc\n-Too predictable and not confusing enough after a level or two\n-Tech: Monitor cursor annoyingly hard to find/disappears.

At its current stage, it can feel more like a disconnected set of puzzles than a constructed story... Even though parts of the story are indeed connected, some of the lands feel foreign with no way to trace them back to objects in the house. This is specially true for the garden and the black labyrinth which doesn't seem to remind any part of the "wakeup" environement.\n\nOn the other hand, the few puzzles that are available can be challenging at times and the semi open world and surrealist graphics really do makes the whole place feel like a dream. This game takes from some of its predecessors like Myst and Antichamber to create some of the weirdest and most beautiful sceneries that I have seen in a game so far.

The reason is that this game is very different from the "mainstream" games (and I mean not to sound like some pretentious hipster, but that is the reality of it).\n\nSome people will look at this and think "What the ♥♥♥♥ did I just buy?" and will probably go on to try and be a pretentious dumbass saying that their review is the only one you should listen to, and that the game is utter ♥♥♥♥.\n\nOthers will ♥♥♥♥ themselves with joy at how incredibly artsy the game is, and will never shut up about how great the game is. (That is, if you have a decent PC. It is getting optimized, I can now actually play the game at a survivable frame rate, but if you have anything lower than a gaming computer keep your cash for now, unless you plan on waiting to install/play the game in what seems to be the near future.)\n\nThen there is no middle ground, because the game is a hit or a miss with everyone (like Proteus or Dear Esther).\n\nI VERY STRONGLY suggest looking at the game in VIDEOS.

You wake upon your sofa having successfully managed to sleep through whatever show it was you were hoping to watch. So you decide the best thing to do is head to bed. When you get to bed your dream is full of floating cubes and a strange gate which you travel through. You now find yourself in a canyon of some kind which you explore until you find a stack of computers. Now in order to progress you must make your way through four mazes, turning off lots of lights whilst being chased by some mysterious ‘smoke’. Confused? So was I…\n\nThe basic idea behind Dream is fairly solid. Walk around until you find a puzzle, solve said puzzle and then move to a new area. However it’s a game with no tutorial or even directions of any sort. The puzzles (when you eventually reach them) are fairly good. They’re varied, interesting and at times need some thinking about and highly enjoyable. With one particular puzzle took me a good amount of time to even figure out what I was supposed to be doing and solving it gave me a huge sense of satisfaction.\n\nWhether you’ll like Dream largely depends on how long you think it takes for ‘Exploring’ to become ‘Aimless Wandering’. Returning back to the house I began to look around and found lots of clue to Howard’s life or rather more about his recently deceased author uncle who’s house he now seems to be living in. The other levels also seem to have plenty of these little hints and secrets but finding them quickly becomes a chore and just finding the next puzzle to progress can be frustrating.\n\nThere are three acts (four if you include the starting house) and each act offers two ‘Side Dreams’ these are bonus optional puzzles and/or areas adding a little variety to the game. There are also the Nightmare Acts. I’d love to tell you about them but I refuse to play them. I started the level something moved down the corridor a door slammed and messages were scrawled across the mirror in blood. I’m not great with horror even when I’m expecting it so I decided to leave it. However what’s clear is that it contains a decent amount of content for a game of this type especially when you include the 30 collectable ‘Dream Bible Scraps’ and a handful of other collectable items\n\nDream is quite pretty and it’s also backed up by a great soundtrack. But the asthetic of the game is obviously made for a VR headset. This is especially clear in the rollercoaster side level that would probably be quite impressive if you were but on a screen was dull.\n\nIt’s difficult to make up my mind on Dream. On the one hand the puzzles for the most part were excellent, and felt like a grown up, slightly harder Professor Layton kind of thing. The small hints of depth in the world and varied locations were also great. But I keep coming back to one sticking point, it just took so much wandering around with no real direction to find what I was looking for. This is especially true in the third act where it took me about half an hour to even find one of the puzzles! There are some people out there will really really love this game, but for most of us I have to say it’s probably one that we’ll never get round to finishing it properly.","December 5, 2015","true","3.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You wake upon your sofa having successfully managed to sleep through whatever show it was you were hoping to watch. So you decide the best thing to do is head to bed. When you get to bed your dream is full of floating cubes and a strange gate which you travel through. You now find yourself in a canyon of some kind which you explore until you find a stack of computers. Now in order to progress you must make your way through four mazes, turning off lots of lights whilst being chased by some mysterious ‘smoke’. Confused? So was I…\n\nThe basic idea behind Dream is fairly solid. Walk around until you find a puzzle, solve said puzzle and then move to a new area. However it’s a game with no tutorial or even directions of any sort. The puzzles (when you eventually reach them) are fairly good. They’re varied, interesting and at times need some thinking about and highly enjoyable. With one particular puzzle took me a good amount of time to even figure out what I was supposed to be doing and solving it gave me a huge sense of satisfaction.\n\nWhether you’ll like Dream largely depends on how long you think it takes for ‘Exploring’ to become ‘Aimless Wandering’. Returning back to the house I began to look around and found lots of clue to Howard’s life or rather more about his recently deceased author uncle who’s house he now seems to be living in. The other levels also seem to have plenty of these little hints and secrets but finding them quickly becomes a chore and just finding the next puzzle to progress can be frustrating.\n\nThere are three acts (four if you include the starting house) and each act offers two ‘Side Dreams’ these are bonus optional puzzles and/or areas adding a little variety to the game. There are also the Nightmare Acts. I’d love to tell you about them but I refuse to play them. I started the level something moved down the corridor a door slammed and messages were scrawled across the mirror in blood. I’m not great with horror even when I’m expecting it so I decided to leave it. However what’s clear is that it contains a decent amount of content for a game of this type especially when you include the 30 collectable ‘Dream Bible Scraps’ and a handful of other collectable items\n\nDream is quite pretty and it’s also backed up by a great soundtrack. But the asthetic of the game is obviously made for a VR headset. This is especially clear in the rollercoaster side level that would probably be quite impressive if you were but on a screen was dull.\n\nIt’s difficult to make up my mind on Dream. On the one hand the puzzles for the most part were excellent, and felt like a grown up, slightly harder Professor Layton kind of thing. The small hints of depth in the world and varied locations were also great. But I keep coming back to one sticking point, it just took so much wandering around with no real direction to find what I was looking for. This is especially true in the third act where it took me about half an hour to even find one of the puzzles! There are some people out there will really really love this game, but for most of us I have to say it’s probably one that we’ll never get round to finishing it properly.","December 5, 2015","true","3.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aerotactics/recommended/229580/","aerotactics","Aerotactics","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aerotactics/","28 products in account","Dream is a game that makes you think inside-the-box in outside-the-box scenarios. I came across this game by accident: I wanted to find a newer game that was similar to LSD: Dream Emulator, a game I have never played, but want to play something like it. Dream did not disappoint that urge, but in its current state, it does have a few things I want to point out.\n\nWARNING: The following will contain spoilers.\n\nI decided to purchase this game recently after it had been sitting in my wishlist while I was broke. I wanted something new and different to play. This was a good choice, but some things still bother me:\n\nREALISM: This game is set in a realistic scenario, where you play Howard, a British man who, should we say, talks to himself alot. The story comes from his abstract dreams which are supposed to represent the dreams (and nightmares) we have in real life. When playing this game, I don't feel like I'm in a dream at all. If we are being nitpicky, dreams are different levels of hazy, and are not always in perfect lucidity. I mention this because I want the game to feel like a dream, not just a series of abstract levels and puzzles.\n\nLINEAR: In its current state, the game is very linear, Yes, there are small worlds in which you can explore, but each dream leads to the next, and the start of the game is always the same: Go to sleep, go to the hub world, go to a dream world. I can't help but feel a sense of repetitiveness every time I start the game up. I feel that the dreams should be random, and should randomly link to other dreams. I also think not every world should contain a puzzle. In the abstract worlds of dreams, most of the dream is exploring, or for some people, just letting your dream control you, tell you where to go, and tell you what to do, like a story.\n\nPUZZLES: I've never had a dream with a puzzle in it. I also think this game puts too much emphasis on the puzzles, and not enough on the exploration. Puzzles, in my opinion, should be a rarity, not how you reach the next level. I think each level should be the result of picking up an item, or enteracting with a being.\n\nPORTALS: I think the portals that are currently in use are unrealistic for the dream scenario. I also think nightmares should not be easily noticeable based on the color of the portal. Nightmares are not something that can be avoided when they start, so seeing a black portal would be unrealistic, and gives us the choice to enter it or avoid it.\n\nDIALOGS: Between dreams, there are some dialogs between Howard and his uncle Ed. These dialogs seem to last for what feels like hours, and all I'm left to do is sit there and wait it out. If there's any way of making these dialogs a little shorter, that would be great. I want to get to the next level already.\n\nI think this game could be better, but I would still recommend it to those interested in playing a game based on dreams. I do wish that there will be larger worlds, more exploration, and a more interactive story. I also hope that there is a better use of Howard's house. Currently it is only used for the Tutorial and the nightmares. I think it should have more use as a bigger part of the story, such as if Howard has a job, or people coming over, then Howard could also live a life during the day, and the game could use Howard's workplace for dreams and nightmares, and more exploration. Consider the state of this game as a prototype. It could use some polishing and added content. Looking forward to the development of the game, and its evolution.","September 12, 2015","true","6.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

While at times its enjoyable, overall it isnt great. Game has a lot of problematic bugs which need to be fixed. Until they are it may might be best to avoid buying this game\n\nFull Version:\nThis game takes quite an interesting concept of being able to explore dreams and solving puzzles in them. You play Howard ,a young author, who has moved into the house his recently deceased uncle Edward left to Howard in his will. The game has you exploring Howards dreams (and nightmares) to try and resolve Howards issues. The dreams are generally quite enjoyable and visually nice areas where you root ot puzzles and try to solve them. The puzzles are a bit hit and miss with some enjoyable, others not so much.\n\nGood points:\n-some of the dream levels are really cool and do look very beautiful\n- the music is good and fits the game quite well\n\nBad points:\n-its a very buggy game. I had to reload a few times due to bugs. For example in the first Act i had to jump into a hole which my character got stuck in and i couldnt move. Later on while doing a puzzle i couldnt activate an item i needed to use. From reading the forums its seems like other players have had a lot of problems and the devs havent patched it in months.\n- the voice acting is very poor. The actors sound so wooden,like they're reading straight from a script. Also the sound level on the voices tends to fluctuate a lot going from audible to inaudible.\n-this game felt like a tech demo for VR at times. Theres one section which is blatantly there just for someone wearing a VR headset to experience and serves no purpose to the rest of the game.","January 16","false","6.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, I would say after the first tedious puzzle that has you turning off lights in four seperate catacombs, the game picks up dramaticly. More portals appear and the story develops quite a lot. The game has so much secrets and content for you to find and work out, you could easily play it for hours on end and still find areas that you previously never seen. The story is bled through the environment really well, with nightmares being alot more personal and quite uneasy at the same time. The atmosphere is incredible and the soundtrack. I hope this game is updated frequently because there is so much potential for this game, to be even bigger!","July 20, 2014","true","7.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The trailer looked fantastic, but the gameplay seemed a little too 'open ended' in the sense that I spent hrs just walking around trying to figure out what to do. There are plently of other casual simulators out there, but this one just didn't draw me in as expected. There's no direction whatsoever, and the puzzles (e.g., the Graveyard) are far too complicated for no reason and don't have any reward for the time put into them. One may argue that that's the point of a 'lucid dream simulator', but it just didn't make me want to jump back in over and over again.

The gameplay, however, is lacking; in that you really don't do much apart from explore and solve a few puzzles. The puzzles range from mildly entertaining to "I'm going to spend four hours doing this" and vary greatly. The game, to me, is a bit of a walking simulator; but that's okay. I love the game for the atmosphere that it gives me and the story it presents me with. The hub, which you'll see in the beginning, filled with white cubes, is absolutely astounding. Oculus Rift support makes the game even better; though the controls are fiddly and can get especially annoying when in the Oculus.\n\nIt's not an experience I'd recommend to everyone because not everyone is looking for an experience, they're looking for a game. This isn't the kind of game you come to for that.

Just a couple of points for possible buyers:\n\n1) The first 'world' is the least compelling and the hardest in terms of puzzles. Don't be put off by this, keep at it and you have some really incredible levels to look forward to.\n\n2) The second 'world' is actually really great fun. The office is well designed, reminds me of the Stanley Parable. The puzzles on the computer in the lab are really clever and feel rewarding once finished. The multiple-gravity-stairs miniworld was exactly what I imagined this whole game to be, I'm so glad it was added.\n\n3) This game is nowhere near being finished. There are clever bits, even a little personal branding going on, that make playing it feel worthwhile overall. For an early-development game, this is well done.\n\nKeep up the good work, maybe change around some things at the beginning and with the voices, and who knows, this could become one of the classics.","May 11, 2014","true","7.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The trailer looked fantastic, but the gameplay seemed a little too 'open ended' in the sense that I spent hrs just walking around trying to figure out what to do. There are plently of other casual simulators out there, but this one just didn't draw me in as expected. There's no direction whatsoever, and the puzzles (e.g., the Graveyard) are far too complicated for no reason and don't have any reward for the time put into them. One may argue that that's the point of a 'lucid dream simulator', but it just didn't make me want to jump back in over and over again. I'll keep my recommendation as positive because I see a lot of potential with this early access game, but it's not ready for the general public just yet.

The gameplay, however, is lacking; in that you really don't do much apart from explore and solve a few puzzles. The puzzles range from mildly entertaining to "I'm going to spend four hours doing this" and vary greatly. The game, to me, is a bit of a walking simulator; but that's okay. I love the game for the atmosphere that it gives me and the story it presents me with. The hub, which you'll see in the beginning, filled with white cubes, is absolutely astounding. Oculus Rift support makes the game even better; though the controls are fiddly and can get especially annoying when in the Oculus.\n\nIt's not an experience I'd recommend to everyone because not everyone is looking for an experience, they're looking for a game. This isn't the kind of game you come to for that. If you want a mixture of walking simulator and game; take a look at Skyrim.","December 7, 2014","true","4.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game has so much secrets and content for you to find and work out, you could easily play it for hours on end and still find areas that you previously never seen.

Even with very light graphics settings, it's a tad on the intense side. But after some gameplay, I am convinced that I might need to upgrade to better hardware eventually.\n\nComputer stuff out of the way, concept-wise, I'm in my first dream world, and I'm liking it so far. Kinda reminds me of some of my dream environments already. I'll add more to the review the deeper into the rabbit hole I go. As an aside, I find it funny that the game's immersion factor is somewhat deep enough, the PC looks somewhat (though doesn't sound at all) like me. Personally, I found it amusing (as a coincidence).\n\nEDIT:\nUnfortunately, this rabbit hole is shallow, and can only go the initial dream inwards. Either my machine's not enough for it, or the latest version has some issues as of now. Kinda expected in it's current state. Keeps on running out of video memory, even on the lowest settings.\n\nEDIT EDIT:\nAfter a bit of tinkering, I made a bit more progress, and I found the first major puzzle. Unfortunately, even at current (low) settings, the game makes me a little scared to progress further without burning out my card or computer.

Unfortunately I can't even finish the first dream because of either game-breaking bugs or motion sickness..\n\nBefore I even got into a dream I got stuck in a bug where I couldn't put down a painting. Just restarted the game and moved on. A couple more bugs and the relaxing pace of the game turned into confusion and frustration.\n\nOnce I did get into the dream I found that the twisting halls of the catacombs and the blurring effects of the dream's desert environment were giving me headaches and making me nausious.\n\nOn top of that the gameplay and narration is sub-par as well..\n\n-The narration is uninspired and sometimes seems hokey the way the protagonist talks to himself\n-The dream itself seemed really gimmicky - like what people try to tell you dreams are like (with random objects from your real life in random places / for some reason you're alone the whole time [from the dream I experienced]) instead of actually creating a setting that better represents how dream worlds might actually be like..\n-The puzzles and dream details are arbitrary and solving them makes no real connection to the character's "journey"\n-Small details like your bare feet making shoe clicking sounds on sand (and hard surfaces too), and your entire body moving in a mirror's reflection when you simply turn your head are just a few of those minor details that can really throw your opinion about the game - even though those things are none too important in the grand scheme of things. (The shoe sounds with bare feet really struck a nerve with me for some reason though :P)\n\nI haven't been able to put more time into this game to experience a nightmare or finish the game - I wish I could at least try. I just can't get past the sickness from playing the game, let alone the bugs that break the game and/or force you to redo tasks you've already done. If I somehow get the courage and maybe take a pill for motion sickness and play the rest of this game I might edit my review, but I doubt it would turn into a recommendation. A disappointment.","June 2","false","0.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

The graphics are astounding, the narration is actually very good, and the worlds are open enough to let your exploration and imagination take over. I do have to admit that some tasks become mundane, light walking through an almost identical maze 4 times to turn off lights got a bit old but the slight changes each time made it tolerable. I found some bigger sections of exploring almost too empty, and almost stopped me from carrying on to see what was around the next corner. I appreciate the little things also, like how experiencing different segments of dreams leads to more spider-mapping on the cork board, and I like the page tears to explain what we see around us might mean to the character we are playing (I actually feel quite sad for him, it feels like he may be suffering from depression or pure loniless... it's these little things that will keep me coming back for more. Also, while playing I did not find one but a map at some point might come in handy, I found a compass but I never felt the urge to look down at it.

Combine this with constant crash and graphical issues and I am disappointed to say that I can't recommend the game in it's current iteration.\n\nIf the operation issues were the only problem I would understand, as the game is in it's alpha stages at this moment, but I felt that (from what I have been able to play when the game does actually run) the "puzzles" have been rather boring and redundant. The main character seems unrealistic and two dimensional, and after logging over an hour in this game, I have no idea what the overarching plot is. What is the point? Am I just... wandering through this dream-scape running through light mazes for no conceivable reason? Am I trying to fix my dreams or...? I don't know. You're just some British dude who is solving puzzles. Based on his voice acting he, like me, is just doing it because he has nothing better to do. I keep expecting him to say, "well... I payed for this game so I might as well play it" since that is what I've been thinking the whole time.\n\nI would also prefer some sort of alternative light source that emanates from the character without destroying some ambiance, or at least a brightness slider. This is the only game that I have ever played in which I was stuck, simply because I couldn't tell if I was walking into a wall or not.\n\nAll in all it needs a good deal of polish before it is playable. I think if the story were more engaging, or if the performance issues didn't exist, it would be worth it, but for right now I'm probably going to delete the local content until the full game is released and I wouldn't risk the roulette of whether or not it would work on your PC if you haven't bought it yet.","March 21, 2014","false","10.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Hopefully in the near future, the issue will be sorted and I'll be able to play the game.  In a nutshell, this game has a game-ending bug that the devs have known about for (at least) a year and a half, and there's an entire Steam forum thread dedicated to it.  And given that they're going to be giving out release copies for review in roughly three months, I'm slightly concerned for them.  It seems like it's going to go very, very badly for this game if they hand out review copies of this game to major reviewers and the only thing that they can say is "Yeah, I played it for 5 hours, it seemed cool, but then the game glitched out and I couldn't play anymore."  In spite of my current experience, I really hope these issues get resolved and that the game is successful.  It's the first game I ever paid any attention to on Steam Greenlight, and it's one of the few that I voted for to be Greenlit.\n\nThe game-ending bug:  So there's a part of the game (the Terrace Walkway sub-dream) where you need to turn pillars to solve a puzzle, and the glitch is that the pillars don't turn, they just wiggle back and forth and prevent you from solving the puzzle (and thus unlocking the rest of the game).  So... yeah.  This basically forces my hand, and I have to not recommend this game until this issue is sorted.\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nA Review of the Game (the portion of the first world that I can actually get through)\n\nSo Dream is a game coming from a group of unseasoned but clearly very talented game developers.  The style of the game itself is not entirely unique (it's in this new genre of games like Lifeless Planet and Dear Esther, which I guess you'd call atmospheric explorer games), but the execution and game itself are quite original and the execution is, in spite of a few issues, quite brilliant.  I think a lot of people are going to rag on this game essentially because they don't like atmospheric exploring games, but I think that they should be ignored.  The game itself is extremely fun.  So I look forward to being able to play the game in May.\n\nBy the way, people have also been complaining about the puzzles.  I thought the puzzle of the head stones was really very clever, and it required probably two hours straight of messing around with it and a lot of logical thinking, which I thought was very fun.\n\n\nWarning: SPOILERS.  I will say a few things, however, that probably should be changed (and quite possibly are, this is an early-access copy after all).\n\n-- Although this game derives a lot of its uniqueness from sort of dropping you into a world and letting you slowly discover what the heck it is that you're supposed to be doing, there might be a little more of an idea of what's going on.  After spending an hour or two walking around aimlessly, the game starts to get boring, no matter how pretty the scenery is (but see my next point).  So would try to either make things a little bit more straightforward/logical or find some way to boost the player with at least a little bit of guidance.  I kind of feel like the beginning of the game needs to have a little bit more of a tutorial on what the game is about and some mindfulness of the fact that if they players get stuck in these large worlds, they're going to be bored.\n\n-- The game is supposed to be a big, beautiful open world, but your first level feels constricting and often claustrophobic, particularly the mazes.  Also, as near as I could tell, the mazes serve no function, yet there are many of them, and they aren't really fun and it's not conveyed in any way to the player that they don't need to waste two hours bumbling aimlessly in the scenic equivalent of a straightjacket.  If I have to bumble around aimlessly, I'd prefer that I was doing it in a big, open world where I get to freely explore.  (The Terrace Walkway, by contrast, had none of these issues.)\n\n-- You guys need to work out how to get the clicking of collectable objects more... functional.  I walked by the grass cutter to pick up the strange stone multiple times, and tried to press it multiple times to no avail.  You have to stand in the EXACT right spot the EXACT right distance, otherwise you'll never see that you can pick up the stone, even if you notice it might be something you can snag and actively try to snag it.\n\n-- The sun is WAY TOO BRIGHT.  Holy crap!  You guys need to turn that down a bit, you might blind someone. It also makes reading signs really hard, and it distracts from your wonderful landscape in certain cases.\n\nAgain, I really hope I'll be able to play through this game in the future and give it a much more robust, positive review.  From an alpha stage, so far so good, but you guys are publishing this soon, so hop to it!  We want to see your game!","January 24, 2015","false","5.2"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","2"

My friends and I attempted to play this game twice, and both times unfortunately ended with us quitting from frustration, at lack of gameplay and direction, at least from what was visible to us.\n\nThe depth of field is far too aggressive in this title in general, where it seems completely out of place in nearly all cases. The desert level could benefit from a sandstorm to give the depth of field more purpose for being there.\n\nThere seems to be quite a few scaling issues in this game also, particularly in the house, where parts of the furniture can end up dwarfing other parts, in particular when comparing the dining table to the piano, one is clearly out of proportion.\n\nThere are also quite a large number of texture issues. One such example is the wood grain in the house, where all the furniture seems to have the exact same wood grain and also have prevailing texture seams that are easily seen. I would recommend the developers polishing up the existing assets before continuing adding too much more to the game.\n\nAlso please fix the over repitition of some of the assets, such as the grass, and hexagonal rocks, as well as the overly used light shafts that do not match up with the cast shadows.\n\nIn the stone maze in the desert level, we found that the corridors used perhaps 4-5 different types of rock, that were not only different sizes, but different colours and styles. While it is clear that this is a dream of the character, it still seems odd that the stones are so different.\n\nsand is bland, much boar, very no wow.","June 9, 2014","false","1.7"," 16 of 31 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","16","31","0","0"

This game unfortunately is the latter one.\n\nYes the screenshots look pretty nice and you get a feeling that this game is related to Myst or Uru but unfortunately it doesn't come even close to those games.\n\nThe main character model is horrendous. It looks like it was taken straight out of an asset pack. Why did they even include it in the game considering they did not make any facial animations, swimming animations, proper walking animations, inventory animations and made the character look as a teen, while the voiceover sounds as if he was 30? Just WHY?\n\nThe game world itself is an awful incomprehensible mess. The "hub" level leads to other levels, which in turn lead to other levels, which contain various items of unknown purposes and are hidden or scattered all over the place without any reason or pattern whatsoever. While the puzzles turn out surprisingly dumb and easy and can be finished in just a couple of minutes, getting to those puzzles is whole another thing - you don't have a map or a clue to where you are supposed to be going or what you are supposed to be doing or searching for. You can't even start to make sense or understand what you are supposed to do unless you find some walkthrough's or hints on forums and youtube of which there aren't that many.\n\nHonestly - this game is just too frustrating and confusing, and i couldn't force myself to enjoy it or being a remotely interested in the process. I don't understand whether the developers tried to make a horror, a walking sim, a genuine adventure game or neither, and i think the developers don't know either.\n\nIf only levels had a pattern to them, if only you had a map, if only there were less bugs and texture glitches and invisible walls, if only they had a professional voice actor or didn't have voice actors at all, if only the music wasn't so damn loud and out of place... this could've been a better game but right now i feel like it wasn't even worth 3 bucks i paid for it on sale.","September 6, 2015","false","2.9"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

With that placed aside you will probably develop a love/hate relationship with this game, while the main character development is uninspiring thanks largely to the main charcter being some sort of dimwit and the connection relationship between reality influencing dreaming has hardly been touched, it will still inspire you want to venture further sheerly because of the imaginative and creative backdrops.

Despite vsync, a 980ti and other high end hardware this games gives me an awfull load of screen tearing. Lowering the resolution or overriding nvidia's settings on the game doesn't help. I like smooth gameplay and visuals, screen tearing is something that personally makes me hate a game. However this game has potentional and it looks gorgeous so I will patientfully wait for the updates...\n\nThe graphical settings that can be adjusted are just to minimal. They should've given plenty more of options. For example I don't like blur, disabling it still results in a blurry depth in the distance.\n\nThe game doesn't deliver much of a guide/tutorial on how to interact with certain puzzles. You just have to try every key to get to know the results, you can ofcourse check out the key bindings, but personally I don't think that a player has to go that far to get familiar with the important keys.\n\nIt is also unclear as what to do, you kinda explore and free roam while solving a puzzle so now and then, then you enter a portal and scout out a new place where not everything always work as you'd expect.\n\nProbably the last thing for now that I found rather irritating, is the inventory. After messing with the keys I figured out that scrolling makes me pick an object from my inventory and it slowly materializes into my hand. This slowly.. is awefully annoying. It looks splendid and amazing, but that feeling fades away when you cycle through objects to inspect what they are... waiting for like 10 seconds per object results in a big time waste. If you have to look a small thing on a map you'd wait 10 seconds for it to materialize. So the wait is longer than what you have to look for. In the beginning I thought the game was just broken or so since it took that long.\n\nApart from the puzzles being rather simple, they are close to unique. You won't find many other games with the same type of puzzles.\n\nI also enjoy the option of making my own choices rather than having a linear gameplay.\n\nAs the last pro, the visuals are superb have to hand it out to them.\n\nTL;DR\n-screen tearing\n-unclear goals\n-hard to get used to basic game mechanics\n+visuals\n+freedom\n\nEdit:\nForgot to mention 1 important thing, if it weren't for the music I'd quit this game after 5 minutes. Due the nice musics and clear voices I continued and discovered interesting elements, only reason I won't take a refund and just wait it out.","December 26, 2015","false","0.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This game unfortunately is the latter one.\n\nYes the screenshots look pretty nice and you get a feeling that this game is related to Myst or Uru but unfortunately it doesn't come even close to those games.\n\nThe main character model is horrendous. It looks like it was taken straight out of an asset pack. Why did they even include it in the game considering they did not make any facial animations, swimming animations, proper walking animations, inventory animations and made the character look as a teen, while the voiceover sounds as if he was 30? Just WHY?\n\nThe game world itself is an awful incomprehensible mess. The "hub" level leads to other levels, which in turn lead to other levels, which contain various items of unknown purposes and are hidden or scattered all over the place without any reason or pattern whatsoever. While the puzzles turn out surprisingly dumb and easy and can be finished in just a couple of minutes, getting to those puzzles is whole another thing - you don't have a map or a clue to where you are supposed to be going or what you are supposed to be doing or searching for. You can't even start to make sense or understand what you are supposed to do unless you find some walkthrough's or hints on forums and youtube of which there aren't that many.\n\nHonestly - this game is just too frustrating and confusing, and i couldn't force myself to enjoy it or being a remotely interested in the process. I don't understand whether the developers tried to make a horror, a walking sim, a genuine adventure game or neither, and i think the developers don't know either.\n\nIf only levels had a pattern to them, if only you had a map, if only there were less bugs and texture glitches and invisible walls, if only they had a professional voice actor or didn't have voice actors at all, if only the music wasn't so damn loud and out of place... this could've been a better game but right now i feel like it wasn't even worth 3 bucks i paid for it on sale.","September 6, 2015","false","2.9"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Granted, I didnt get very far in it... but within an hour of play I didnt really want to any more. There are many graphical bugs (such as the player shadow not animating and looking like a scarecrow following you about) and landscapes are bland and its fairly easy to get lost and be forced retrace your steps. It gets old real fast.\n\nThe dialog is lame and, in my opinion, the character just does not seem that special or likable... it's like peering into the life of that middle class guy from school or uni you knew was a decent person but simply wasnt fun enough to want to get to know.\n\nIts in my opinion that games are meant to be fun and their characters unique and memorable.

I saw the shadows of Gone Home, Anichamber, Stanley Parable and very little of Dreamfall, neither in a good way nor bad way. It just bits and pieces sewed together.\n\nThe story of an uncle giving a house to his nephew is very similar to Gone Home, and it is not very convincing. There should be more materials to tell the backgroud story on why the uncle would give his house to his nephew, and why after he passed away, the nephew would feel bad enough to have strange dreams. (Edit: After replaying, I learned a bit more. There are still many mysteries to be solved.)\n\nExploration is a good part of the game, but the puzzles are so-so. The desert part was great and the office part was good too, but that was it. The puzzles are okay. They had been created before and they are not innovative enough to be very interesting. (E.g. the mazes)\n\nI found some bugs. There are some with the food swapping puzzle which the sushi would move out of place and there was a hidden plate of food.

It is also possible to finish this game in about 2 to 3 hours. There were many points in the game where the glitches either distracted from the game itself, or were entirely game breaking. For example: when I entered on of the side levels to see what was in it, the entire level was turned at a 45 degree angle which made it imposible to play. There is also some story is presented by two voice actors talking to one another. i really hope you like it because it is reused over and over after literally every level, and it goes on for a long time too. Basically, it will replay the same thing just with a little bit more added to the end of it. It also has one of the worst I have seen in a long time; because, after you beat the sixth level, all you have to do is enter the last portal in the hub area to win. I'm not joking, that is how it ends. I'm incredibly disappointed because I have supported this since it first came on steam, and I was hoping that many of the issues would be fixed when it came out of early access, but they weren't.\n\nJust buy a different game, it's not worth $17.

Suddenly he saw Trayvon and was instantly filled with rage when he saw this little ape walking in his proud white neighborhood.\n\nZimmerman grabbed his Hitler Youth knife and AK-47 assault rifle, which was illegally modified for full auto and had banana clips loaded with cop killer rounds. You could never be too careful with these monkeys, after all.\n\n"Hey you ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥, what are you doing here?!" Zimmerman yelled.\n\nTrayvon jumped when he heard Zimmerman's brazen swearing and use of racial slurs. His grandmother had always made sure that such language was never spoken in her household.\n\n"Please sir," Trayvon said politely "I am only on my way home to my grandmother's house."\n\n"You walked into the wrong neighborhood, ♥♥♥♥♥♥." Zimmerman said as he cocked his AK-47 assault rifle.\n\nTrayvon threw up his hands over his head in surrender. The iced tea and Skittles hit the wet pavement.\n\n"♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!" Zimmerman yelled before unloading the entire clip of his AK-47. Trayvon never stood a chance against Zimmerman's full-auto assault. Trayvon hit the ground, bleeding out from 57 bullet wounds.\n\n"That'll teach ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to walk around in my proud Aryan neighborhood." Zimmerman sneered. He clicked his heels together and gave a crisp Nazi salute before leaving the boy to die.\n\nTrayvon looked up to the sky and saw the hand of black Jesus come down and lift him directly to Heaven.\n\nZimmerman pulled out his cell phone and dialed 911. "Yes, 911?" Zimmerman said as he polished his AK-47 menacingly.

Buy this.\nHowever, if you'd rather save your money for a game that actually has a point outside of walking about, doing little more than faff about, I recommend that route.\nPerhaps the game will update into something that I could call "playable."

You have a Gone Home (available on Steam for few dollars) type of house where you can switch lights on and off + close and open drawers.\n2. You have terran generator run on UDK. You can pretty much test this youself by downloading it for free.\n3. You get REALLY FREAKING HORRIBLE voice acting alongside of disasterous dialogue writing (which suits it well). Luckly there are only around 5 lines that the guy repeats, always referring himself as Howard...devs please... the person in Stanley Parable repeats his name because he is the storyteller. If I refer to myself by first name all the time I am either Julius Caesar or just a narsist.\n\nAll this can be experienced in a "dream" which is just a white room filled with cubes or endless catacombs. Depending on which one you like to have dreams more about! After about 2 hour of gameplay I found yet another interesting catacomb where I could run around to shut down the (wait for it..) lights in it! ...I need to spoil you, but my fun of running around and shutting lights was spoiled by black blob that teleported me outside the catacomb. I havn't had that much fun since 8bit Nintendo or C64 where this kind of gamplay was quite normal.\n\nLet's say something positive too: The background audio doesn't get annoying in the first 1 hour. The second hour on the otherhand...\n\n1/10\nTHIS IS WORTH AVOIDING BY ALL COSTS (Even with 33% off steam sale)\n\nTL;DR\nThis is not early access alpha, this is "I finally got it complied!" prototype.","December 2, 2013","false","2.8"," 22 of 65 people (34%) found this review helpful","34","22","65","0","1"

You will often wonder if you are stuck on a puzzle or are experiencing a hopeless glitch; it's hard to know which. This ruined the experience for me, and I'm sure that the developers would admit that this is not the kind of quality that should be expected for a "finished" game.

As such, the fact that the game for the most part is a walking simulator where you sprint from A to B (and sprint you will) with only the occasional riddle or puzzle did not particularly bother me, and many parts of the game (such as a large park or a south sea resort built entire on offshore platforms) are nice enough to look at that you won't mind spending roughly half and hour simply running around in the place.\n\nUnfortunately, the developer's approach to the dreamworlds the player moves through is rather conservative, especially if you consider how you could put virtually anything into them. This becomes especially sad when you consider that many of the smaller "side dreams" actually tend to be way more interesting than the larger main levels. But safe for one side dream that looks as if straight ripped out of a McEscher painting and another more abstract area with looping corridors and warping tunnels, the infinite potential a veritable dream has in terms of design simply is not fully used. Instead, the game largely relies on fairly generic landscapes with the occasional out-of-place object thrown in to remind you that you are still dreaming.\n\nAdd to this that the game's story is only seen in retroperspect, and that investigating the home of the player character for about ten minutes will tell you everything you need to know in order to predict the good and the bad ending,  and you will come to realize that the game simply lacks a strong source of motivation. You don't care about getting to know the story because you already know what happened and what will happen. You don't care about exploring new worlds because you expect them to be as bland as the first sand desert/ snow desert level. Even the music (which, for the record, is very well done) only keeps you going for so long.\n\nLong story short, Dream is a game that had an enormous amount of potential, but lost much of it due to design choices.\n\n","November 30, 2015","false","11.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I often found myself looking at guides to have any idea of where to go or what to do when I got there. I would love to play a finished and refined version of this. I hope HyperSloth will continue forging thier game to make it live up to it's concept.","November 22, 2015","false","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its soundtrack feautres some beautiful melodies that absolutely blew me away when I started playing the game.\n\nUnfortunately the gameplay is filled with performance issues, bugs, some shoddy physics, and a general fragility that had me, a newcomer to this game, frustrated. You will often wonder if you are stuck on a puzzle or are experiencing a hopeless glitch; it's hard to know which. This ruined the experience for me, and I'm sure that the developers would admit that this is not the kind of quality that should be expected for a "finished" game.  You will not get through this game without having to do at least a few workarounds or gymnastics to continue through the bugs. (ex. broken puzzle, unable to drop item, unable to pick up item, stuck on an object). I'm very disappointed that this game wasn't what it could have easily (IMO) been, with some extra work and due diligence on the devlopers behalf.\n\nSo if you don't mind restarting often, and are ready to take the very stabililty of the game as an extra challenge, go for it.","August 5, 2015","false","32.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

First, the techinical issues, there are few, but with a game this short I expect none. I thought all the other reviewers were getting bugs from some unfinished version, but what I played is essentially a finished product. The most hilarious bug is when I picked up some random painting in the house and couldn't let it go and thus was stuck, this happenned very early on. Another is that some of the settings you select will revert back within the same session, everytime a new scene is loaded or something.\n\nSo there are bugs, right, one can look past them, they aren't game breaking. How about the graphics? They look...decent, although with some downright lack of polish adn odd choices. Why the insanely short depth of field everywhere you go? That makes everything blurry some distance in front of you, it gets old really quick, it's not like it has some beautiful bokeh like in professional photography, it's just blurry. Maybe that masks some of the pop in artifacts, but surprisingly it doesn't mask the lack of antialaising, which isn't even an option, and it's very noticeable. The art style looks pretty at first, until you get into the larger levels and they look the same, oh gosh, the same art assets sprinkled everywhere, the same textures for miles, mazes that you'll just spin around in. I'm a very visually directional kind of person so if everything looks the same and there's no map, I get frustrated and lost.\n\nThat issue with repetitive graphics really ties into the gamplay. In a game heavy on exploration, there's no incentive to explore when the novetly wears off so quickly and it all starts to look drab. Example, there's a section with four mazes, it all looks the same, and worse yet the lights turn out as you go around it, there's a shadow creature that goes in some pattern, but there's no way to learn or see what the pattern is. That's not good level design, that's not a challenging puzzle, it's just tedium. I really gave up on this in the third act, where there's about fifty little hotel rooms to go in that all look fairly identical, with absolutely no direction as to the purpose of these seemingly useless rooms, there I am feeling utterly lost, and not in a "I really gotta find the solution" kinda way. Upon looking up how to do it, you find arrows in these rooms and match the numbers, I think geez, that's not a puzzle, and my reward? Another identical section of these little hotel rooms.\n\nYou get the idea, so sound and music? This game has it, some people like it, but I'm not into ethereal background music and found the mix quality utterly horrible. You can't hear the protagonist speaking over the music, he seems to murmur, and yet the music isn't even loud at all. I also found myself distracted when the voices didn't match the subtitles, was that inteligible Howard because it says illegible Howard, how did you get that line wrong Howard it's written on the wall Howard?!\n\nSo in summary, ever since playing Portal 1 and 2 I've been looking for this kind of game, and I thought I would like the relaxing beautiful exploration trip this would take me on as I solved cool puzzles. Instead I found my intelligence insulted, and my aesthetic senses not stimulated at all, and above all utterly frustrated and lost...kinda like in one of those bad dreams...","February 2","false","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That combined with poor framerates (with graphics that shouldn't plummet the FPS), and no updates since August, leaves the game too much of a mess for it to be worth $17","January 11","false","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And the movement of this game has started to make me feel sick. The swaying is something people have complained about. I'm going to have to change this to one I don't recommend. I hope the developers get back to this and start to dramatically improve this game. There have been fun exploration games like Qbeh-1, Talos Principle, etc... none of them that made me have a headache like this game. And the dock area was the worst. Oh and I haven't played it in a long while, and my progress seems to have reset when I first opened it. Sorry, but I need to change my review to a thumbs down. For now.\n\nOld Review: This is just a nice casual exploration game with some very interesting parts to it. The nightmare parts are a bit terrifying. The game is still in development so much more will come, but so far I am enjoying the experience. As far as to whether the game is for everyone... it isn't. This isn't a game where you will see non-stop action, even though it is based on the Unreal engine. The graphics are good in certain parts, while not as great in others... but that is to be expected.\n\nThe puzzles are a challenge at times and require some level of thinking. The experiments in the Augmented Reality offices dream are quite a challenge. I will not spoil much, so i'll keep this short. If you want a game with non-stop action, look elsewhere. But if you like a casual exploration/puzzle game that provides a challenge, I do recommend Dream.","May 7, 2014","false","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game does a good job of capturing the strange and otherworldly aspects of the human mind while bringing the title character on a journey to understand his life better. The puzzles are often decently thought out and will make you put some time and consideration into how to surpass them, and there\'s the small hook of wanting to see what the next dream will be and trying to press on.\n\nOn the other hand, the story often just feels like window dressing and the game is quite buggy. After playing for around 4 hours, I encountered a bug that was big enough and annoying enough in this one garden area that I finally quit playing the game. Prior to that, while I found several glitches in puzzles as well as environmental bugs, I was willing to overcome them to press on, but this one was game breaking for me.\n\nThis is one of those games I wish I could have enjoyed more than I did, but sadly I suppose it just wasn't meant to be. Still, it felt like there was some potential here, and as always your mileage may vary. I definitely would not recommend it at the asking price, but at an extreme discount, it could be worth tinkering with...maybe.\n\nOn a scale of 0 to 10, where 5 is "average," this game gets a rating of:\n\n===========================\nFLAWED...... 3 / 10\n===========================","May 31","false","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
