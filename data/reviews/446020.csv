"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tribal-bob/recommended/446020/","tribal-bob","TribalBob","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tribal-bob/","447 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n11:30 at night; the country road stretches out before me for miles, yet with my low-powered headlights I can only see a few dozen feet ahead of me.  The mud is so caked on over my windshield, I squint through a small portion not covered in order to see ahead.  Almost at the next gas station, just a few more minutes - but my engine suddenly begins to smoke before dieing, only enough fuel to pull to the side of the road.  A frustrated sigh, I turn on my hazards before stepping out onto the road beginning to walk by foot to the station when it starts raining.  Perfect.\n\nWhen you hear the term 'roguelike', you usually envision an RPG or a shooter in which you play until you die (and you will eventually die) before restarting with your saved progress and taking another shot.  I would have to say that even if the developers of Jalopy don't classify their game as such, it's probably the first roguelike driving simulator I've ever played.\n\nHow can a game about driving a beaten up old car endlessly down a road with far less graphic fidenlity and less linear routes than something like Euro Truck Simulator be fun?  Mainly it's because this game initially comes off as very basic, it's actually very, very deep.\n\nReally, the car is you - that is to say you play a human driving the car and you can get out and sleep in Motels, or purchase coffee in gas stations, but really the car is your identity.  It starts out very basic with a cheap engine, small fuel tank and standard road tires but over time, you can earn enough money to upgrade everything about it.  Just like leveling up an RPG character and distributing skill points, you're improving this care on your endless journey and yet it's no less compelling.  Do you find yourself running out of gas frequently?  Get a larger capacity fuel tank.  Not going fast enough? Upgrade your engine.  Every component can be swapped out and changed, tailoring the car to your own personal preferences.\n\nAs a player, you're limited to what you can carry in your hands at any given time, and you're limited to what you can bring in the trunk of your car.  You can usually fit the necessities - an extra fuel can or two, a repair kit, some water for coolant and some oil - but what about that box you found at the side of the road filled with coffee.  You could dump a fuel can to make room and sell it for profit, but what happens if you run out of gas...\n\nThe intro story is farily basic at this point - you and your uncle go on a road trip from old Eastern Bloc Berlin.  Really though, the provided story simply acts as a launch point for a player run story.  You look back at experiences you have on this trip as the things that really stick out in your mind, like the time your car ran out of fuel under an overpass on the Autobahn and you had to walk 10 minutes in the pouring rain and pitch black to the nearest gas station to get a fuel can.\n\nAnd let's talk about the atmosphere for a moment - the graphics are heavily stylized, very dark and simple which only seem to add to the game's charm.  There's nothing more cozy than being in your car as the rain pelts down outside, muffled slightly thanks to the excellent audio design work.   The cheap motels you stop off at in each town and dark, almost too dark but then you're not really there to sight-see; you're there to catch a few hours of sleep before hitting the road once more.\n\nBeing in Early access, the game is not without it's bugs; drivers tend to ignore your hazards and will sometimes plough into your car while you're parked on the side of the road trying to repair your engine.  Some objects don't work some of the time, and you can sometimes find yourself trying to highlight the object you want when there are several, larger items in the way.  The dialogue your uncle rambles on with would be interesting but due to the lack of voice work, it requires you to actually read it; something that is near impossible to do while driving down the road.\n\nJalopy has all of the ingredients of a strangely quirky yet interesting game; and given enough time and polish, these elements could come together to make it something very special.  Even right now at $10, it offers up a decent amount of gameplay and replayability that's sure to keep you entertained even while slogging down a pitch black country road with a gas canister.","April 24","true","3.7"," 211 of 219 people (96%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","96","211","219","20","5"

If you're able to deal with the bugs listed below and more then you should buy the game, I had a ton of fun despite the bugs.\n\n1. Cars run into your vehicle while pulled over on the side of the road, and it ends up piling up and causes a huge mess.\n\n2. Dialogue sometimes dissapears or is broken.\n\n3. If you drive off the road you end up going under the map and are forced to restart.\n\n4. Saving and quitting just restarts your game to day 1.\n\n5. During the later part of the game, after crossing the border, you're forced to cross a train track and your vehicle ends up being damaged, for me I didn't have a repair kit and the store ahead didn't have one either, and I was pretty much forced to restart.\n\n6. When crossing the boarder, one time the guard told me that it was closed even though I could cross easily, and when I tried to return to the motel I wasn't able to buy another room.\n\n7. The sorting in the trunk is horrible.\n\nThere are probably a lot of other bugs in the game that I haven't seen yet or forgot to list, but as I said before you should probably wait until these bigs are fixed, as of right now I don't think the game is very playable, however I give it some slack since its early access.","April 24","true","6.0"," 80 of 86 people (93%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","93","80","86","10","9"

If youre looking for a full complete driving game right now, pick up a euro truck simulator instead, and come back to this once its done.

Jalopy is the deal of the century in comparison. You and your batshit crazy Uncle drive your Trab... I mean, err, Laika, across a procedurally generated Soviet landscape circa 1990 (which is pretty accurate, honestly, grey colours, hotels in which you can hear monsoons in the hallway, and snarky 24 hour store clerks), trying to keep the rolling deathtrap on the road and get to your destination.\n\nThe devs clearly have a deep love for the car, which can be repaired and modified at the side of the road or at a Laika dealer, who of course will sell you better parts than the ones that you scrounged from Uncle's garage/barn. You can measure this car's acceleration by holding a stone up in your hand and watching the wind erode it, which is pretty much exactly how Trabants are. You add gas AND two-stroke oil to the two-stroke engine through a gas tank mounted over top of the engine. Makes you feel privileged to drive that 1989 Tercel, doesn't it, comrade?\n\nThere's lots of bugs, as befits an early Alpha access title, some of the more amusing of which are Laika dealers ripping you off for car upgrades that never show up (wait, is this a bug?), Uncle's brain falling out and having him stuck in the car/motel/floors/stairs/traffic. The extremely amusing multi-car pileups that occured even with your hazard blinkers on as you tried to fix your beleagued people's car don't seem to occur anymore, which makes it easier to fix your car I suppose.\n\nBut honestly, there's enough humour and heart here for anyone who doesn't mind a first-person strategy simulation with a decidedly Griswold Vladivostok vibe. I'm sure it'll come together. Well worth the money to watch the devs take this road trip somewhere.\n\nJust don't fix the car. It's fine, comrade. Smoke is healthy. You are lucky.\n\n","May 3","true","8.2"," 39 of 41 people (95%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","95","39","41","16","2"

Ok, somethings smells fishy here. Has Donald Trump become president/ the world gone crazy?\n\nSo, what the hell is Jalopy?\n\nGenre?\n\nCar Owning Simulator, in this case a Tra.. I mean Laika.\n\nPlot?\n\nSeriously, I don´t know. But since you are in the DDR or GDR (I´m German, don´t know the english name of DDR) and have to drive a Laika, while everyone else drives superior or at least more modern cars than you, my guess is, you want to move to Poland or Slovakia to not see those far superior cars anymore. These fricking Snobs in their stupid Oshibka´s and Trussi´s.\n\nIn what way Car Owning Simulator?\n\nThis game is very accurate in owning a car in general. You have to think about almost every detail for driving and maintaining a car, although the repair part is very simple. You even begin to build your car yourself by building a complete Engine. Although the engine itself isn´t really that detailed, you have to maintain every part and even have a correct mix of fuel and oil (the last part is kinda special, because your Laika runs on a 2-stroke engine), buy new parts if old ones break, change tires if they break and most likely more in the future of this game. And for driving you need to put in the key, hold the key until the engine starts, pull off the handbrake and ,for bad weather/ the night, enable wipers and headlights. Also you get a passport, a purse with money you need to buy stuff, a map of your way and a manual of the Laika.\n\nHow does it drive?\nAlthough this game is very detailed, the handling itself is very arcade-like. The car is instantly on top speed, it doesn´t really lose grip ever and if you hit the wall you stop immediately. I don´t mean it´s bad, I mean it doesn´t really fit into this very detailed driving experience, although it kinda fits into its unique graphic style. Still, I would appreciate a more realistic handling and steering wheel support, but I can imagine it would be hard to develop that on Unity.\n\nUnique graphic style?\nMate, look at the screenshots.\n\nThe End?\nYes, I really like the concept and the realization of this game. Has quite a few bugs, but this is Early Access.\nOnly the handling thing I talked about is weird. But still, in this early stage (0.4 pre alpha), it is very fun to play.\n\nAny wishes?\nMoar Cars.\nMoar realistic handling, if possible\nSteering wheel support with Force Feedback.\nMoar detail in the Engine parts.\nManual gearbox\nMaybe the possibility to take other guys with you.

And I'm happy to say, I'm not disappointed at all.\n\nObviously, it's pre-alpha. I only managed to finish the tutorial on my third attempt. But even so, that tutorial, and my first journey after that (which sadly ended in the middle of nowhere because I forgot to pay attention to having enough fuel) reassured me I was in the right place: this is the gameplay I hoped for when I first saw those GIFs on RPS.\n\nHaving those little details that make you feel *being there*. For me, this is "presence", not VR. Having to pull a lever to open the bonnet. Having to turn the ignition key to start the car. Having to actually grab your wallet from the gloves compartment to pay for the motel, then with the key in your hands, being able to walk around in the building before eventually opening the door of your room and getting into bed.\n\nIt's an atmosphere I wanted in a game for so long.\n\nIt's also reassuring how the developer responds to feedback so far. An important hotfix was just released mid-weekend. A patch is supposedly coming today fixing many of the bugs / missing features (like the inability to get a can of spare fuel at the gas station), and I'm confident there are many more to come, until the game is truly ready. Getting this title right now is not only a journey driving your Laika, but also a journey of seeing how the game shapes into its final form. To me, this is early access done right, not releasing a near-final beta for some bug hunting.\n\nObviously, it's buggy, it's not optimized (it runs on my 4 year old, then-midrange laptop - with onboard Nvidia optimus - fine though) and it has missing features (like saving mid-journey, at least at motels). Driving the car feels wonky and pointing at things is sometimes weird. But the atmosphere? The towns, the motels, the road? It's there already - and it's very unique and likeable even in its current state.\n\nIf you don't like Euro Truck Simulator type of games, hate the art style or want a finished, polished product, then skip Jalopy, obviously - at least for now. But if you're like me, feeling like this is a game somebody already should've made years ago, and eager to see one finally becoming reality, and wanting to try it as soon as possible, ready for bugs and changes - then hell yes, I'd highly recommend it.","April 25","true","4.6"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","22","25","0","1"

The Dev team clearly states that this game is still in VERY early stages of development. So if you buy it you are pretty much an alpha tester, just keep that in mind.\n\nSo, how's the game actually? Well it is one of these games, you didn't know you wanted until you played it. The ammount of attention to detail which has gone into modeling of the Laika (aka Trabant) is just amazing! Every button and movable part is simulated and serves its purpose. Even the Car's Owner Manual looks so authentic. Along your journeys you'll find crates with items, that you can later sell, which in turn you can invest to make your crappy car a little better. Or you even find an abandoned Laika which you can strip for parts. Also, you have to take good care of it, repair, refuel, replace stuff, and even clean it. After a while you're getting really attached to that little machine and ever hit you take causes physical pain ^^\nThe world, even if pretty small right now, also fits perfectly into the setting of 90's east Europe.\nThe art stile might not be to everyones liking (including me) but after a while you get used to it and even see its benefits.\nSo should you get it? Well it depends. If you like Driving games, Simulations and Open world in general then yes. However if you want to enjoy a completed product, just come back in like half a year.\nIf you want to support a small Dev team, which is actually talking to their community and is taking suggestions seriously, then absolutely go get it!","April 23","true","9.1"," 22 of 28 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","22","28","0","1"

As for gameplay: not much content yet. However, it's still playable for a long time, as your money carries through every time you restart, enabling you to work towards upgrades for your car.\nOf course, the game has many bugs, but this game has good developers that make bugfixes their number one priority; something very rare with EA games these days, albeit unfortunately.\n\nI'll update this review to a much more detailed one once the game leaves EA, but I'd implore everyone to keep an eye on Jalopy.

It is made by one man named Greg who has put a lot of effort in this game and began development on it in late 2014 (according to the website). Although this game may currently contain bugs and is not recommended by some people, I personally say to you that you should help support the 1-man dev team to improve the game. Games only improve with both financial and social (community) support.\n\nPros:\n- Unique car that almost everything is interactable with.\n- Good graphics\n- Good looking female shop keeper\n- Ability to buy new parts instead of staying with stock\n- Game is still improving\n\nCons:\n- Bugs (currently - not major, well the ones I have seen anyway.

Jalopy sadly errs towards the latter.\n\nIt's a glorified tech demo, but still fun for a while. If you approach early EA titles as something to try, leave for a patch or two and come back to, in short bursts, then it's definately worth a look, if you expect something a bit closer to a finished product, then move along.\n\nJust hit "follow" first, this definately has potential.","April 23","false","4.4"," 27 of 43 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","27","43","2","3"

I would say it is good though it does have a lot of bugs, some small some big, but nothing so far for me that would make me give it a negative review, it's in Early Access so of course it's not finished but the foundation is there and it's pretty solid. Also the game has recieved a couple updates today alone so the developer is clearly working hard on this game.\n\n--Gameplay--\nJalopy is a game where you go on a road trip with your Uncle but before that begins you have to finish fixing your car up by putting in all the essentials under the hood of the vehicl, putting a passenger door on and putting a jack under the car and putting the wheels on. The Tutorial is pretty helpful and gives you an understanding of what you should do even if you aren't too familiar with cars and their parts. After that you choose a route and head off, you have to be careful when driving to not crash or stop (DO NOT, Stop in the middle of the road, the drivers are ruthless and will crash into you at 80mph, and then if they don't push your car out of the way they will reverse and do it again), when driving you may enounter engine or other part faults. You can bring things in the trunk of your car (Which you pretty much must do) which is very helpful as if you break down with no repair kit you are screwed, you can also bring a bucket of water and wash your windows if they get dirty (And a bunch of other things, oil, fuel etc).There are shops and gas stations which you can buy various other things. I haven't gotten too far into the game but that's pretty much all I've experienced so far.\n\n--Bugs--\nI feel like this should be it's own catagory since the game is early in development and bugs are heavy. Some big bugs range from getting stuck behind the shop gate and it not opening again, people have said they got stuck in the motel and of course don't forget the insane drivers ramming you at 80mph if you stop.\n\n--Conclusion--\nThe foundation is there and the game is fun, even if the game bugs out and I have to restart I haven't felt like not playing since it's a pretty fun game and as the game develops it can only get more fun. I give the game an 8.5/10 with an expectation of 10/10 for being an Extremely unique experience with so much already to it.\n\n--YouTube Video--\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiqmDmIzIDo\n\n--Game Highlight--\nMy car broken down in the road so I got out, closed the door, turn around and saw a car speeding towards me, Uncle got out and stood infront of the car as I backed away. The car collided into the back while the car stood at 180 degrees against Uncle and dropped back down.

In short, yes I do. I actually really like it. I did not think I would have this much fun in a game like this. I love cars I always have and I have always wanted a game where you can do stuff like you can in Jalopy. There's a couple of downsides to it though. First, not many options to choose from especially audio options. Second, there are quite a few bugs but that is normal for a new release. Other than those issues, I don't see many other bugs but it seems other people have,\nbeen having a lot of issues with the game when I have been lucky. But I truly love this game and I think that many other people will but its more of set to a certain audience that likes fixing their own car and selling and trading stuff. (and if you like to steal you can walk out the store with items). But other then the issues and bugs currently in the game I love the game and I'm probably going to be playing it for awhile.\n\nVerdict:\n\n95/100\n\nSummary:\n\nGreat game quite a bit of bugs and issues at the moment and the options are minimal.

In Jalopy you get an old car in working order with basic parts. You’re going to use the car to make a journey from Germany to your family’s home and your uncle is along for the ride. It’s not going to be an easy journey though and you’ll need to manage your car along the way by repairing, refuelling and upgrading it. You’ll also have to plan your journey carefully, you choose from three defined routes for each leg of the journey (of which there are currently two) but you’ll have to keep an eye on your fuel so you stop in plenty of time, run out of fuel and there’s not much you can do apart from restart.\n\nFull Disclosure: A review copy was provided by the publisher.\nPlease note: My game time is due to playing the press version of the game several times, I have also finished the second country currently in the game. The game (in its current state) can be beaten in around thirty-forty minutes.\n\nIt can be difficult to find the sweet spot for releasing a game into Early Access. You need to have enough content in there to keep players happy but you also need to leave room for the game to grow based on the feedback from the community. Unfortunately, like many Early Access games do, Jalopy has released with too little content. What’s there is reasonably good but there’s not enough of it to fully show off what the game has to offer (I’ll come back to this later). What’s worse is that the game currently has very little replay value, in my experience anyway. After I played the press version through the first time I had no desire to play through it again, I only did so to see if I had missed anything. Obviously this will improve as the game continues through development but this is a review for its current state and since the amount of content/replayability is an important consideration when buying a game I felt it was something that had to be included.\n\nOn to how the game looks, the colour palette is great but the graphics themselves let the game down a little bit. The dull and dreary colours might not be the nicest thing to look at but they do a good job at creating the depressing world your character is hoping to escape by going on this journey. Now, I’m the kind of person who always says that graphics maketh not the game but there are exceptions to every rule. Honestly, I’m not too bothered by Jalopy’s graphics but they’re by no means excellent. It’s not a big enough problem for me to affect my overall opinion of the game but it is a problem for other people which is why I feel it’s worth including.\n\nRight, back to the meat and potatoes of the game. The game currently features Germany and the CSFR, two countries means two legs of the journey with more countries to be added later. The parts of the two countries you drive through are very different to each other which is great. Germany is all about autobahns and the CSFR is dirt-track driving. The main problem with only having two countries at launch is that there’s not enough time in the game for you to really experience any of what the game offers. Two countries means two opportunities to refuel, one opportunity to buy upgrades/repair your car and one border crossing. The border crossing wasn’t overly interesting, I imagine it’s more interesting if you get caught trying to smuggle illegal goods across the border (you find things on the side of the road which can be picked up and later sold for profit) though I was rather fond of how had a similar feel to Papers, Please. Upgrades can be bought from Laika dealerships which are found in the game’s cities and you can also get parts from junk cars left by the side of the road. Repairing your car is pretty simple, you just buy a repair kit and then click on the part you want to repair and it’s magically repaired! Three uses per kit. There’s not much to say about refuelling other than it’s a good idea to refuel whenever possible because unless you want to walk back to a station you’ve passed, you’ll have to restart.\n\nJust a few more things to mention. I’m well above minimum specs and should be at least capable of running it on High settings and yet I was struggling to run it well on Medium settings. The settings are also incredibly basic, you have an overall quality setting for graphics as well as resolution, vsync and a fullscreen toggle; audio is only master volume and gameplay is currently just look sensitivity. My last issue with the game is that it currently has no controller support (and no wheel support, I don’t have a wheel myself but I know a lot of people prefer using wheels for driving games). I found controlling the car with the keyboard controls to be incredibly jerky and imprecise, making the game less enjoyable. Next up, while I’ve only experienced a few bugs, there have been quite a lot of complaints about the game being buggy. I get that it’s an Early Access games and most Early Access games do have bugs but it’s worth knowing that Jalopy is particularly buggy in its current form. Lastly, I had a problem with the tutorial. The tutorial itself is great but unless you Save and Quit after completing the tutorial and then choose Continue when you want to play the game. It’s inconvenient but it’s not exactly bad enough to write home about, the problem I have with this is that the game doesn’t tell you that you have to do this, I only know this because I read about it in the forums which not all players will do. Personally, I’d prefer to just be able to skip it but at the very least there needs to be some information provided to inform the player about this.\n\nVerdict\nAn excellent concept for a game let down by its lack of content and a range of other issues. The problem with having such little content is that you can’t fully enjoy what the game is supposed to be all about and that makes an already weak launch even weaker. At the current price and in its current state I simply cannot recommend Jalopy.\n\nLone Ranger Reviews.\n\nEl K.","April 22","false","1.8"," 92 of 168 people (55%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","55","92","168","7","3"

I played the 0.39 pre-alpha press release, and i had a lot of fun...\n\nJalopy is a word for an old/wrecked car that can barely go and looks horribly. And that is what this game is all about.\n\nIn Jalopy, you drive an old wreck named "Laika 601 Deluxe", a two stroke, 25 Miles/gallon, 0-100 Km/h within 22,5 seconds etc.\n\nThe story starts when your uncle in a trippy coat wakes you up and wants to drive east. So you wake up, get a spare door from a pile of wrecks, slap on some tires, build the engine, plan your path and you are good to go!\n\nWhile driving, it's good to have a repair kit, a full gas tank, a spare bottle of water&oil and a carjack, because you never know what lies in front of you in this game!\n\nSo, now pros and cons:\n(I am not putting any not added features in the game to cons because I am writing this review the day it was released)\n\n+ A great gameplay of mixed adventure and car management game\n+ Your engine is very fragile, a one essential part goes off and you're done adventuring, so you must be careful\n+ Realism in this game is at a quite high level\n+ you can pick from different routes\n+ not so stunning graphics compensated with a stunning atmosphere\n+ SO MANY THINGS IN THE CAR TO PLAY WITH\n+ original concept\n\n- Sometimes, the uncle is overreacting a bit\n\ni would definitely reccomend this game and i give it 9,9/10, but if you want a better experience/longer gameplay, then wait few months.","April 22","true","2.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Right now I don't think it's getting the love it deserves but it will get there. For so long I have waited for such a game. Here's what it is:\n\n- You have a junk car of a communist brand. It barely runs.\n- You have to go on a long journey with this junk heap.\n- The car has to be maintained, cleaned, refueled, upgraded, spent money on so that it is able to make this journey.\n- You can carry stuff in your trunk, and on the roof rack (if you buy it) let it be maintenance equipment, illegal goods, car parts, boxes, stuff.\n- Stuff you find around can be sold at shops and gas stations for money.\n- Money in turn can be used to upgrade and buy ♥♥♥♥.\n- You have to manage your space wisely. Your car needs maintenance, but you can also put expensive stuff inside your trunk to sell later. Or you are an obsessive and even if your car is doing very fine, you still stuff maintenance equipment into it :3\n- Basically you just drive on long highways and sometimes winding dirtroads while doing all of that.\n\nCONS AND PROS:\nCons:\n- Very buggy as it is in an early alpha stage. That's what early access means.  Bugs will be expected and stomped. Nearly 75% of the content in the game is currently just a placeholder. Don't cry because there is no content. There will be.\n- No wheel support yet. YET. They said they will implement it later on.\n- (FIXED) Maniac ai drivers ploughing into you.\n- Vehicle flips, and there is no way to flip it back.\n\nPros:\n+ My dream game of driving and maintaining a car, all the while also tackling other things and even customizing the car.\n+ Different, pretty styled graphics. I love seeing these type of games every once in a while.\n+ Devs constantly update the game. Read the blog to see for yourself. And every update brings something. For example the next update will bring painting the car I think.\n\nWatching Youtube playthroughs and looking at screenshots might not cut it for this game. Just go ahead and play it, there is always a refund option. Give this game a chance. It deserves going forward.\n\nFinal verdict: 10/10 Totally worth the buy.\n(coming from a person who has bought 10 early access titles in 3 years of steam history)","May 21","true","6.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","88","7","8","6","1"

Minskworks has done a lot to make this otherwise simple game rather deep and I've easily put 6 hours into it just wanting to figure out how everything 'works'. To sum up what this game is? What genre it belongs to? It's a rogue-like driving simulator. A roadlike, I suppose we'll call it.\n\nThere's an elegance in simplicity when it comes to the environment design. The backdrop you occasionally get to look at while you drive is mostly just trees, industrial chimneys and power plants--what you'd expect when you're driving on the Autobahn.\n\nAll in all, the game is damn neat and I have really enjoyed playing.

Each car part you pick up has detailed information on its purpose and simplified specifications (as far as fictional car parts go), and the sepia tone camera gives everything a humble and nostalgic feel to it; fitting with the 'June 1990' calendar in the garage.","April 22","true","0.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It feels like a roguelike driving sim. You start in your Uncle`s garage, you build your car, you load it up with supplies for the journey, and you`re off. Along the way you have to maintain your car, manage your money, find loot on the side of the road, buy and seel goods at gas stations, auto-parts stores, and the Laika dealerships and more.\n\nMy rule of thumb for buying early access is that I have to like the way the game plays in its current state (so if the devs run off I still have something good) to determine whether of not to buy it. So far it is a great buy. The tutorial is well designed to make it feel like it`s not a tutorial and there is a neat little story that goes along with the game. And the devs seem to care about the future of the title.\n\nThe game is also pretty imersive requiring the player to actually use the car keys, hood release, parking brake instead of just pressing buttons on the hood or just get in and drive. It give the car a sort of sentimental feeling because you have to do all the work yourself and continually upgrade the car.\n\nThe only drawback is that the characters communicate exclusively through speech bubbles which can be a little distracting when you are barreling down the autobahn at 90kph.\n\n10/10 for physics defying tweed jackets!","April 26","true","3.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zanriel/recommended/446020/","zanriel","Zanriel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zanriel/","874 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nListen, this game is built in Unity which as we all know is kind of a mixed bag in terms of quality. However, the concept is awesome and I think this game is going to be good. Right now it has issues though, which makes me want to wait until it's spent a little more time in the oven before playing it. I certainly can't think of anyone I could recommend this game to UNLESS they're so charmed by the IDEA of it that they're willing to support something that may or may not work quite right at the moment.\n\nThe issues?\n\nNo gamepad support, controls are keyboard only, but they're not too bad. Looking around with the mouse while steering with WASD (or whatever scheme you prefer, for me it's ASD-Space) actually works fairly well. However, the game is honestly pretty buggy. The main bugs I've found are related to disappearing objects. Sometimes if you pick up objects or try to use them in the wrong order, or if you don't do exactly what the tutorial expects of you, you'll lose items. People lose tires, I've lost my wallet, it's a mess.\n\nNow that I've gotten past the first part (where you stop at a motel before crossing the border), I've found myself going in circles on the map. Maybe I'm just a terrible navigator but the map you can access in the car only seems to let you choose a route (which I presume is how it generates the terrain or roads) but it doesn't actually serve to help you navigate. All you can do for that is to follow road signs and hope you're going the right way, unless I'm missing something. In my situation, there was a road that went over a bridge, and if you keep following that road you'll circle back and go over the same bridge again and again. Or you can take a side (dirt) road, which still takes you back to that stupid bridge. By the time I realized I was still going in circles my car had almost completely broken down. All tires and engine components had 1/3 durability and I had no way to repair anything since a repair kit only has limited uses. Stuck.\n\nThis game will probably be awesome when it's done, as long as the developers are honest and funded well enough to keep going. If not, then in its current state it's only about 30% playable. What I mean by that is that if you sit down to play, you have a 30% chance of things working the way you expect them to and to make progress, but there's a 70% chance that within a few minutes of starting you'll find yourself hitting a wall that prevents you from going any further, but without knowing for sure if it's a bug or if it's just you.\n\nWhat is this game? Think of a cross between Euro Truck Simulator 2 and FTL and you'll have some idea. A bit of randomness to it (so they say, I haven't been able to play enough to test that), combined with driving through European countryside in a vehicle that doesn't perform even as well as the car sitting in your own driveway. That's what this game is and it sure sounds awesome. The art style reminds me of "Interstate 76", anyone remember that game? I never had it but I've seen plenty of screenshots. That's what this game is, some interesting screenshots and a promise of something really cool behind it.\n\nI can only recommend this game to people who are captivated by the idea, but until it gets polished a bit more, and maybe has some basic quality of life features added (like a working navigational system maybe?), then I can't recommend it to the general public or any of my friends. So I'm giving it a thumbs up until I find out the devs are crooks or too scatterbrained to pull it off, then I might change my vote. So devs, if you're reading this, don't let me down!","April 23","true","1.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

Thats right 54 hours, most of that time was spent restarting due to random traffic jams or the lack of money. In my own opinion the game is well worth the $10 USD I paid for. I'll admit it has its flaws but I expect nothing less from a Pre Alpha. The game starts out slow at first but after the tutorial it does speed up some. The drive you take can be boring and uneventful OR it can be crazy fun and full of unexpected situations. In a world full of copies and remakes, Jalopy is a breath for freash air for driving sims. It's a one of a kind experiance. I would honestly love to see the game keep some of the goofy bugs that don't hurt the game play cause it adds a little flavor to the experiance.

It has bugs, some of which can impede your progress or force you to start over. It isn't complete, there are features not yet implemented, and the physics are not terribly well tuned.\n\nThe developers are very responsive and active in the game's Steam forum. Since yesterday several bugs I ran into have been fixed. They are also receptive to gameplay ideas.\n\nIn its current state, I wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for a game you can jump in and play for 300 hours without a hitch.

I'm posting this to balance out some of the negative reviews left by people who don't understand Early Access.\n\nBasically, yes, the game suffers from being an early alpha. It has bugs, some of which can impede your progress or force you to start over. It isn't complete, there are features not yet implemented, and the physics are not terribly well tuned.\n\nThe developers are very responsive and active in the game's Steam forum. Since yesterday several bugs I ran into have been fixed. They are also receptive to gameplay ideas.\n\nIn its current state, I wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for a game you can jump in and play for 300 hours without a hitch. If you want to be part of its early days and watch it grow, it's absolutely worth the pricetag.","April 23","true","6.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Seriously, the graphics look like something you'd see on an old 286 computer with a CGA monitor. That bad. But then you start to notice things; elements that are evidence of serious care and talent. Even the title screen looks terrible until you start seeing the subtle art choices, the position of the car relative to the newspaper and book. The trees in the background, the colour palette; they are all so polished and purposeful.\n\nYou start the game and are again hit by the horrible graphics. I mean, when I played it, your grandfather's jacket is texture-less so it actually transitions the hold-textures while you're playing. Seriously, its an eye-sore; your granddad with the technicolour monochromatic jacket.\n\nThen you begin building your car - this is a masterful choice of opening. It does not matter that the graphics are terrible, because you begin to bond with this vehicle you are actually having to assemble. There are no shortcuts either (at least, no shortcuts compared to other games of the same ilk) as you have to reach under the steering-wheel to pop the hood and actually put the tires on the car, after jacking it up. You have to pour fuel into the engine, get the oil mix correct, add water to the windscreen cleaner - it is amazing for reason I have difficulty articulating.\n\nAfter a while you get on the road and everything from bugs, to mud, to rain affect your driving. It is incredible. You pull into a service station, fill up the car, take your wallet, use it to pay the cashier, you can buy tools, stock for smuggling...it is nuts how much to do there is in this game. Boxes on the side of the road can yield unexpected treasures, hotel rooms you stay in have unthought-of functionality. I have not even mentioned how you can stack things seamlessly in your trunk, kind of a mini-game of 3D Tetris.\n\nThis game, in pre-alpha, was more fun to play than some AAA games. I like it for what it represents - gameplay over graphics. Trust me, this game is a blast.","April 26","true","4.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","2"

I couldn't make any progress due to a number of issues.  Items would disappear, required dialog would disappear, Items wouldn't fit in the trunk even if it was empty (and the auto-sorting is horrible).  Parts wouldn't attach to the car.  Tools would disappear  (How can a spanner wrench only last 3 uses?!).\n\nI was really excited about this game, but I had to request a refund.  I'll definitely check back on updates but as of 4/22/2016 this game is not ready.","April 22","false","1.6"," 22 of 42 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","22","42","0","8"

I like it but, because of the early access, I can't play it properly. For example, when the sun goes down and street lights on, the lights color is changing to pink. Maybe it is easy to fix it but it is giving a disturbance. In addition, I can't SEE my cursor on the main menu! It is really difficult to find it!!!    Please fix it!!!    One more thing, please make a tutorial for buying, selling items, etc... Maybe addition for keybindigs and PLEASE stop the other cars hit to my Laika!!! It is very annoying because really hard to earn money in this game!

But apart from those issues I have mentioned, this is a good game with lots of potential and I would recommend anyone that is interested in this game to give it a try.\n\nI will make a new review when the game progresses further.\n\nOverall Rating: 6/10","April 25","true","1.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

It seems a little tedious at the beginning, but as you play it more it becomes easier to fix your car, and change the tyres. The game is very buggy, but again it is a very early stage.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/iblim/recommended/446020/","iblim","[YP] Iblim the Changeling","http://steamcommunity.com/id/iblim/","390 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nPlease note; this review was written for Pre - Alpha 0.4, the game under review is therefore not necessarily reflective of the final version.\n\nI would like to begin by assuring you, if not made evident by the positive declaration heading this review, that I have enjoyed what I have seen so far from this game. While it is in pre-alpha state, however, it is still a paid for product and must be reviewed as one.\n\nTL;DR for those who don't want to go through the whole review: Game's good, go buy.\n\nBrowsing 'YouTube' one day, I came across a video featuring 'Jalopy' posted by the famous internet based videogame journalist 'Jim Sterling'. In this video, Mr Sterling gives his thoughts on his first few moments of gameplay and, from what I saw, I became immediately enammoured with it.\n\nI quickly leaped onto the 'Steam' store and searched 'Jalopy' in the search box. Considering what I'd seen of the game through the aforementioned video, I put the game on my wishlist and purchased it shortly after.\n\nI'd describe this game, if pushed, as a rogue-like with elements of a driving simulator; in which the player is tasked with travelling from location to location along partially randomly generated routes trading for supplies and performing maintenance in order to journey for as long as possible.\n\nThe game is undoubtedly buggy, very buggy. A comprehensive selection of screenshots featuring some of said bugs can be found on my screenshot library. Despite this, however, the game is a ton of fun, even in it's pre-alpha state.\n\nThere may not be much to do and explore at present but what is here is incredibly enjoyable.\n\nSTORY:\n\nThere really isn't one yet.\n\nThe premise is simple in that you and the old man are travelling from Berlin to (seemingly) Turkey, crossing across multitudinous borders, sleeping at motels, and trading at gas stations along the way. It is your job to keep your vehicle well maintained and manage your wallet well, selling goods to traders and smuggling goods across the borders.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n\nGameplay namely consists of driving along motorways and country roads as a means to travel inbetween cities, occasionaly stopping in order to pop the hood and maintain the engine or change the tires. Keeping fuel, oil, and water levels topped up as appropriate is also essential (the water less so as it's used for the wipers).\n\nSupplies for vehicle maintenance, and for trading, can be purchased at the occasional gas stations sometimes present along the various routes, or at marts (refered to as markets) that can be found in cities. It is also at these places that items found in boxes (found lying to the road side along the routes) can also be sold.\n\nThe above is of great importance as sleeping at motels, and upgrading the vehicle at auto shops, requires money, but once you get used to how trading works in the game, you'll be making hundreds of dollars before you know it.\n\nMUSIC:\n\nThere's little music in the game save for what can be found on the radio, for which I have no comment, save for that it does indeed sound like a radio. What music and other sounds are present, I do feel add to the overall atmosphere of the game and authenticism of the setting.\n\nGRAPHICS:\n\nPolygonal, but I find it endearing. Yes the graphics are basic, but everything looks like it belongs and it gives the game some visual identity to seperate it from other games made in the Unity engine.\n\n---\n\nI enjoyed this game very much, and even in this early state, it comes highly recommended. If you're into games that feature resource management, vehicle maintenance, or trading; then this is very much a great choice of game.\n\nWell worth playing and replaying.","May 5","true","26.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Now mind you, it's Early Access and that means there are a few things that need ironing out and you may encounter glitches and bugs from time to time but since i bought it, they have been actively updating it and fixing these things. You start out with an old eastern-bloc Trabant vehicle analogue called the Laika. You start out with all the parts, the carburetor, air filter, fuel tank, ignition coil, water tank, 2 stroke engine and the like, but throughout the game one must continue to take care of these parts to keep their vehicle running, parts can be found in abandoned vehicles and bought with money which can be obtained by selling items found in crates on the roadside.

The concept of the game really appealed to me.  Unfortunately, as of this writing, there are still some significant issues with this game.  When I first started, I followed the uncle to the car and put the components inside the hood (or bonnet.) Then I added the fuel, water, and oil, but evidently not in the right sequence, because the uncle said it still needed oil when I had used the whole container.  So I restarted the game and put them in the sequence he told me.  It worked fine for a while, and I was able to get the car off the lot.  Then, I headed toward Dresden and stopped for gas (i.e. petrol) at the first station.  It was a long time before I realized my wallet was still in the glovebox of the car, so I had to get it.  As I put my purchases in the trunk/boot, my wallet mysteriously vanished even though I still had some monies left over.  I did not find it in the glovebox, but away we went.  Just before we get to the first border, the game crashes and I had not saved.\n\nPros:\n-Nice story\n-Likeable characters\n-Somewhat educational\n-Has an early 90s nostalgic feel about it\n\nCons:\n-Car drives a bit choppy\n-Disappearing wallet\n-Difficult to find the controls (have to go to main menu to view and set these keys)\n-Game crashes without warning (must save often)\n-Cannot run car unless you put liquids in the exact sequence Uncle tells you\n-Annoying honking and random crashing noises, even when parked off the beaten path\n-Sometimes, Uncle tells you stories while you are trying to concentrate on driving\n\nOverall, a good game.  I am hoping these issues get resolved so I can start really having some fun with this.\n","April 24","true","26.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

I'm glad I got it and I'm enjoying it. I haven't felt that way about an EA for quite a while. I'm not being munched on by zombies, but I am being rear ended by Volkeswagens and it's kind of nice for a change. Those games are great for what they are and this game is great and will be better for what it in the future. I also know what it's like to have a crappy little car you're in love with (1971 Honda AN600) and have it break your heart almost daily. This way, with Jalopy, I don't have to go through that seething, burning, grinding ♥♥♥♥ing checking account emptying mess and . . . . oh, I'm sorry. Was I raving? . . .  Anyway I do recommend it even though I'm not even going to list pros or cons. I don't care. I'm enjoying this and that's all that counts.\n\nTo the devs: Might there be some nice DLC's in the future? If so, maybe you would consider some of my  ideas:\n\nDLC 1) "Nephew, Today We Buy Proper Computing Machine Racing Wheel!" ~ this serves two purposes. One, to have fun raising the money to buy the wheel, then getting to go find the computer store and Two, having an actual selection of real life, if not slightly altered-name (for copyright reasons. Yes it says Stolgitek but, hint hint, you and I know it's Logitech) brand racing wheels that are actually compatable with Jalopy. Thus saving you and us, the people who actually research things before we spew bucketloads of ignorance-filled diarrhea out our pie holes on the discussions page.\n\nDLC 2) "NO, Not In Car!  We Find Hospital! You Have Baby There!  OKAY?!" ~ Yes, you have to drive a lady to the hospital to have her baby. It could be someone on the side of the road, it could be your girlfriend, it could even be your dear dear Oma. Get creative.\n\nDLC 3) "The Eugene Hutz Add-On". ~ Yes, Eugene Hutz from Gogol Bordello and "Everything Is Illuminated" fame as the character Alex, as your sidekick. He can point out interesting landmarks and provide you with unique advice when you don't need it.  Bare witness and say yes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wdd-JNJtsYc\n\nDLC 4) "Oh Mr. Smirnoff! Not You Again! You Are Rascal, No?!" ~ And of course the obligitory American reference to Eastern Europe vodka consumtion.

The concept of the game really appealed to me.  Unfortunately, as of this writing, there are still some significant issues with this game.  When I first started, I followed the uncle to the car and put the components inside the hood (or bonnet.) Then I added the fuel, water, and oil, but evidently not in the right sequence, because the uncle said it still needed oil when I had used the whole container.  So I restarted the game and put them in the sequence he told me.  It worked fine for a while, and I was able to get the car off the lot.  Then, I headed toward Dresden and stopped for gas (i.e. petrol) at the first station.  It was a long time before I realized my wallet was still in the glovebox of the car, so I had to get it.  As I put my purchases in the trunk/boot, my wallet mysteriously vanished even though I still had some monies left over.  I did not find it in the glovebox, but away we went.  Just before we get to the first border, the game crashes and I had not saved.\n\nPros:\n-Nice story\n-Likeable characters\n-Somewhat educational\n-Has an early 90s nostalgic feel about it\n\nCons:\n-Car drives a bit choppy\n-Disappearing wallet\n-Difficult to find the controls (have to go to main menu to view and set these keys)\n-Game crashes without warning (must save often)\n-Cannot run car unless you put liquids in the exact sequence Uncle tells you\n-Annoying honking and random crashing noises, even when parked off the beaten path\n-Sometimes, Uncle tells you stories while you are trying to concentrate on driving\n\nOverall, a good game.  I am hoping these issues get resolved so I can start really having some fun with this.\n","April 24","true","26.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

I'm glad I got it and I'm enjoying it. I haven't felt that way about an EA for quite a while. I'm not being munched on by zombies, but I am being rear ended by Volkeswagens and it's kind of nice for a change. Those games are great for what they are and this game is great and will be better for what it in the future. I also know what it's like to have a crappy little car you're in love with (1971 Honda AN600) and have it break your heart almost daily. This way, with Jalopy, I don't have to go through that seething, burning, grinding ♥♥♥♥ing checking account emptying mess and . . . . oh, I'm sorry. Was I raving? . . .  Anyway I do recommend it even though I'm not even going to list pros or cons. I don't care. I'm enjoying this and that's all that counts.\n\nTo the devs: Might there be some nice DLC's in the future? If so, maybe you would consider some of my  ideas:\n\nDLC 1) "Nephew, Today We Buy Proper Computing Machine Racing Wheel!" ~ this serves two purposes. One, to have fun raising the money to buy the wheel, then getting to go find the computer store and Two, having an actual selection of real life, if not slightly altered-name (for copyright reasons. Yes it says Stolgitek but, hint hint, you and I know it's Logitech) brand racing wheels that are actually compatable with Jalopy. Thus saving you and us, the people who actually research things before we spew bucketloads of ignorance-filled diarrhea out our pie holes on the discussions page.\n\nDLC 2) "NO, Not In Car!  We Find Hospital! You Have Baby There!  OKAY?!" ~ Yes, you have to drive a lady to the hospital to have her baby. It could be someone on the side of the road, it could be your girlfriend, it could even be your dear dear Oma. Get creative.\n\nDLC 3) "The Eugene Hutz Add-On". ~ Yes, Eugene Hutz from Gogol Bordello and "Everything Is Illuminated" fame as the character Alex, as your sidekick. He can point out interesting landmarks and provide you with unique advice when you don't need it.  Bare witness and say yes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wdd-JNJtsYc\n\nDLC 4) "Oh Mr. Smirnoff! Not You Again! You Are Rascal, No?!" ~ And of course the obligitory American reference to Eastern Europe vodka consumtion. As a famous nightclub patron in the movie Weird Science once said; "Drink Iiiit!"\n\nThank you for your patience.","April 23","true","2.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

I was expecting a relaxing, sometimes challenging roadtrip where the journey is more rewarding than the destination. But as they often do for real-life road trips, the weird Uncle completely soured the mood and my opinion of this game.\n\nAs a tutorial mechanic, the idea of an uncle giving you your first car by teaching you how to repair and maintain it is a wonderful idea. It gives the player a greater appreciation for the Laika, a way of saying "Hey, I worked to get this running. I should be careful and keep it that way." As a constant companion, however, the uncle made a negative impact on my overall experience with the game. His constant blithering on about nothing important was annoying in itself, but the fact that his speech bubble locks you out of your controls was ultimately what made me refund this.\n\nOverall the game has potential, but in its current form I cannot give it a positive vote.","April 27","false","0.6"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","7","15","0","1"

I don't know what it is about just taking a liesurely drive around the countryside, but it's really fun. Taking care of the car is an interesting mechanic, something that I'm not used to, but it increases replayability. The car smoking and starting to die gives me PTSD-style flashbacks to my time taking care of my '68 Beetle though...so it's nostalgic and nightmare fuel at the same time.\n\nI do recommend this game to anyone who wants to play it, it's fun even with it's current bugs. Just be wary of it being in early access. Currently there are quite a few bugs (the developers have been quick to squash quite a few of them). My biggest concern currently (especially considering what little time I have to play games), is that there's no real save feature. The game will save...your car.

The devs don't show any signs of pulling a "Gary Newman". Constant updates and communication make this game worthwhile.\n\nIt is a very interesting concept with an astronomical amount of potiental for improvement. Already built on an original foundation of ideas and concepts, and taking very little from other games. Jalopy stands out from the crowd, and even in its very buggy alpha stage right now, has hours of fun and replay value. It can only get better from here.\n\nJalopy has aspect of inventory management, survival, RPG, and loot'n'lug.\n\nCONS:\n-Only a single default game mode is currently available. It feels like there should be more.\n-Navigation can be confusing at times, as you are stuck referring to a map in the glove compartment.\n-There are alot of buildings and signs that are not in English. (All dialogue is in English tho!)\n-There needs to be major economy and durability wear rate adjustments.\n-The mouse pointer reverts to a white period ---> " . " on certain screens, making some selections difficulty, and even causing me to select the wrong map route a couple of times!\n-There is no alternator in the car, which really bothers me. I would also like to see exhaust mufflers for sale, so I can get that deep v-8 rumble from my 2 cyclinder Laika 601 with 29 rwHP and 11 foot-lbs of torque. (zero to 60 in 22.6s!!)\n\nI rate this game 7 out of 10 currently, with expectations of eventually being 9 out of 10.\n\n--Sightblack","April 29","true","10.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The concept is to my liking being a cross between driving, mechanic, and rpg sim with minimalist graphics style.   The main issue is that the game mechanics are roughly as clunky as the car you are suposed to be driving.  It feels like playing Car Mechanic Simulator, which also felt a bit awkward to maneuver and place the parts.  Sometimes just putting things in the trunk can be hit or miss.  The buildings are sparse and functional.  I only found a few boxes on the side of the road, though it is possible to by parts at the border.  It is not quite open world as you might think.  There are a few procedurally generated roads on each map.  You choose one road and that's what you drive on.  You pretty much follow a limited path to your next check point and make repairs/sleep at motel.  You don't free roam GTA style by any means.  Parts do degrade fast, and I had a hard time finding a place to stop to make repairs without cars crashing into me.  For some reason the tool kit got used up fast  as if it were a consumable...or just a bug.  I did hit a bug at the border where it wouldn't let me give the papers to the customs agent so I gave up.  It just felt tedious getting to that point.","April 25","false","1.1"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","1"

There are more crashes in this game than I've ever experienced in any other alpha/pre-alpha version of the game. Bugs are everywhere. Every time I restart the tutorial, I discover new things. For example, on some journeys, I get told to fill up. On others, there is no fuel station and I just run out of fuel. On some journeys I reach the city in no time, on others, I drive on until I run out of fuel and still see no city.\n\nSometimes the companion (your uncle) will have a stroke. Messages will go from something coherent, like "You know, I did this journey once as a child", to "yyyyyyyyoooooooouuuuuuuuuu kkkkkkknnnnnnnooooooooowwwwwwwwwwww,,,,,,IIIII ddddddddiiiiiiiidddddddddddd tttttttttthhhhhhhhhhiiiiiiiiiisssssssss jjjjjjjjjoooooouuuuuuuuurrrnnnnnnnneyyyyyyyyy ooooooncccccccccccccccceeeeeeeeeee aaaaaaasssssssss aaaaaa ccccccchhhhiiiiiiilllllldddddddddd". Uncle, are you having a seizure?\n\nYou'll also notice I keeo talking about this one journey. Yeah, I haven't gotten to anything else yet, because I either can't get out of the city because I'm blocked in by fences, or I run out of fuel before even getting to the city, or I'm not able to sleep in the bed of a motel and can suddenly walk through buildings like a ghost.\n\nMaybe it'll improve in the future. I hope it'll improve in the future. But right now, it's not worth the headache and bugs.\n\nEDIT: A few more things. Fullscreen seems to crash unless I run at 1280x720, and I can't seem to change the quality settings, because the game just refuses to remember it and sets it back to High. The routes also sometimes refuse to show up, showing just 3 black pixels I can select. Catalogs are also broken, after opening it and buying something, I can't go back and buy it again, because all I get is a stupid envelope blocking my purchase invoice.\n\nAlso, beware of any books or any lights. There's a chance they'll suddenly flicker madly and cause seizures. So if you have any seizure history, wait until that's fixed.","April 23","false","9.3"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","2","8","0","0"

I cannot comment on content because it is so buggy that I cannot even experience a full run. I can't even get near it. I cannot tell you how dissapointed I am. Its terrible.\n\nIf you buy this game right now, you will have a bad time.\n\n=======\n\nThank you to the developer for a press tech demo.\n---\n\nJalopy is the kind of game that made me fall madly in love with indie games. This title oozes atmosphere and character. The whole thing is a very surreal experience. It reminds me of Thirty Flights of Loving meets Papers Please, with a twist of EuroTruck Simulator and a smidge of Mechanic Simulator lol. Yes, there are bugs, and yes, you will have feels and smiles the whole time.\n\nEssentially, you are on a roadtrip. You maintain an old car by fixing and upgrading parts. There are choices that potentially change how fast you get there, as well as minor story points (most likely more later). There is a small economy of buying and selling. It's all very cool.\n\nPros:\n+The overall atmosphere and graphics really make you feel a part of the world. Everything feels expertly hand-crafted with love.\n+Playing around with a fully functional car is awesome. All the functional switches and buttons are great. Driving is a blast - especially because all the functions of the car are still operational - just like IRL. For instance, I totally wrecked several times while fidgeting with the radio, or plugging in the cigarette lighter, or using the wipers lol.\n+The controls all work well.\n+The drives feel realistic (hence the EuroTruck Simulator reference). You can spend a good deal of time just cruising on the freeway. This builds an atmosphere like no other. I love rolling the window down and hearing the car and atmosphere get louder. It's quite special.\n+I've only heard the one song on the radio (that is all that was in the press release), but it was perfect. It took me about an hour to finally figure out the radio even existed, but once I turned it on, it just felt perfect.\n\nCons:\n-Don't get me started on how buggy this is  - browse the forums to see how bad\n-Terribly optimized - simply change the recommended specs on the store page to fix\n-Minimal graphics options and options in general\n\nJalopy is one the best indie games I've experienced this year. With that being said - its definately not for everybody. It is an experience.

If a game is developed enough to have people pay for it then it's developed enough to review it on its current state.\n\nTo start off this review i would like to say that i was really looking forward to this game. i have been following it for about a month and a half and i was sad when it was delayed, but now that it's out i see the reason. The game has many bugs as sometimes Old Guy Ben or whatever his name is will just refuse to keep his door shut, other bugs include not being able to interact with anything at all and having to restart, walking through some walls, and etc. not only that but the game only currently has 2 countrys which means you get to go through 2 checkpoints and thats it. On the plus side the different scenery is nice i have seen tons of diversity in the level layouts, and the repairing and upgrading your car is fun along with the system for aquireing more money. Unluckly though all the fun things don't make up for the large amount of negetives in this game overall i would say give it a while and then come back, or just buy it now when its 20% off and then just let it sit until a couple of updates. I will update this review along with the game updates and will probably sooner or later end up switching my view to recomending the game but i will not for the time being as i wouldnt recommend the game currently.","April 22","false","6.6"," 5 of 16 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","5","16","0","0"

The stability is improved and graphical glitches have been reduced. The base gameplay is unchanged but it was fine. The biggest problem is that your motivation for progress is killed when you "beat" the game by reaching the end which is not really the end because the whole journey isn't complete and because each trip route is randomly generated it may take some time before the devs build an entire country. So for now it's like a typical car crafting game where you drive around for stuff to scavenge or sell to turn your junk ride into a fast and durable piece of junk. All it needs now is a seperate free mode where you can roam and cause chaos with cheats to your hearts content to kill time till the next update.\n\nI would recommend it to anyone who loves cars so much that they name theirs but as for casual players who think of driving as a chore and can't figure out how to change a tire, I can't say it is worth it just yet.

Tutorial was extremelly fun to me because never in my life I've put Trabant together. Everything in car is interactive, but not every part has usage (mirrors, interior lights). Driving is interesting, but has no real physics. Handling equals at dry and wet road. Landscapes are still too empty: no small villages or great forests around, and we speaking about Eastern Bloc countries. Traffic also very poor: for early 1990's there should be more trucks, but there are only VAZ-2105 and several VW Beetle. Graphics is stylish, but too minimalistic in my opinion. And, of course, bugs. I couldn't start a new game several times after motel in Dresden. When I choose "New game" it begins at the motel, but not in garage. And today i quit the game because my poor Laika fell through the road into Brown Abyss, just when Czech city approached in the horizon.\nBut this game has a great potential and I hope that developers won't abandon this project.","April 30","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have to maintain, clean and upgrade your car. Before you start yo must choose a route, longer routs require more maint and refueling but you are able to find crates, get out of your car and open them for goods you can sell. You can also buy low and sell in a different area but you might get caught if your bringing contraband goods into a different area by the bordr guards and fined. I like how you can interact with a bunch of things in your car, hand brake, windshield wipers, window, papers ... ect there is a but of a learning curve and your car will be a piece of donkey but when you start. I would have engine troubles half way through the 1st couple of my 1st route. Teheres also some strategy involeved because you can only carry so much, even less before you upgrade and have to decide what to such as repair kits, or perhaps cleaning gear if you are in muddy terrain. Say you find some goods to sell, do you ditch some survival gear for your car and try to make it so a gas station to sell it, hopefully the gas station will then have the survival gear you will need such as a repair kit or jack. You can always go back to the starting area and keep you upgrades, money and goods though. There starting place will also have all you need to get your vechicle in prime condition before starting your trip again. Where this game lacks is content and it has its fair share of bugs such as your wallet being stuck in the air making you go back to the starting area. The map size is very small atm, you can reach the end after a couple of hours with having to restart to the starting area multiple times. So far im 6 hours in and i reached the end and upgraded my vechile to the max and will be waiting for hungary to be added. Personally im already happy with my experice and feel its worth 10 buks. Also when you save you dont save your position on the map but rather your gear and car. When you load the game you will be back at the starting location.  It may sound game breaking but so far i still had a lot of fun with it.\n\nEdit, saving has been updated","April 26","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

The manual looks like the original one, the dashboard looks almost like the real. It's also fantastic that you can change the core parts of the car and I love the tutorial.\nSuch a great idea to build the car first before you can start.\n\n\nBut there's also a few problems:\n\nSometimes the game (or should I say the old man in the game?) dies and you can't go further.\nSo you have to restart, but it's no problem, it's already early access, right?\n\nThere is only one thing I hate. If I want to clean the windscreen while I'm driving, I have to look down and try to reach the little button on the wipers stick. If I miss it, I click on the steering wheel and the car stops. I hate it.\nBut I have a solution for this. I know, how the dashboard of a "Trabant" look like. Just use the original button for the wiping water, which is  on the left side if the dashboard? Next to the rear window defroster?\n\nThe steering is in my opinion a bit to directly. You have to learn it to drive good through a roundabout ;)\n\nMy conclusion:\n\nI fully recommend this game. Try it and you will love it, especially if you like the "Trabant".\nSupport the developer to make this game even more greater as it is. It's 12 euros worth.","May 14","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game, is holy cow its great. Lets take a roadtrip boys, it'll be fun.\n\nIt's indeed a mix of truck sim, and car mechanic sim, making this more than just either, its core is well made, aswell as the graphics are welcomming, I hope it doesnt shift way too much from the initial release. A few hours of gameplay, and you know the purchase was worth it. This will be one of those games, that goes to my "favourites" tab, simply because this is a game that will get more than a test run from me, this is now life. And I love it. It's raining in game as we speak, and let me tell you this, this was the feeling I had while being young, driving with my family down the watery wet roads, nostalgia.\n\nThis game gets a major thumbs up from me, and you should get it too, if your into that kind of play. Its one of those lauches, that sees a big future infront of it, im afraid of that, I like the game very much as it is, it needs small tweaks, but other than that, its quite perfect as it is, for a such early alpha.\n\n-Cpt","April 26","true","23.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

I love it.\n\nI would consider this to be a survival game, but instead of dealing with the usual human issues you deal with car issues.  There is also a fairly deep human element to it that I think is more accessible than most games because the focus is on maintaining that broken vehicle so you can get to the next border.  It feels like The Long Dark in a lot of ways.  You rarely feel like things are really going your way, and the struggle to keep moving forward feels very real.  If your car breaks down in the middle of nowhere, that's just where your car is.  You'll need to leave it behind and go find parts, gas or whatever.  And don't forget to bring your wallet.  Leave it in the car, and you're walking back to get it before you purchase anything.\n\nI have ran out of gas in the middle of the night on a muddy road in the rain, and had to walk to find a gas station.  I've had to remove parts and run on less of an engine than I would expect I could, but still not very well.  I've been stuck on a highway with other cars flying by, honking and occasionally striking my car.  Every moment I enjoyed.\n\nThere are some bugs, but they have been fixed at a good pace and the game seems to be developing nicely.  Outside of general fixes that it seems will obviously be corrected, there are only two things I would add or change about Jalopy.  I kind of wish you could travel alone, and adding VR support would make it great.  Even without those features, however, I think this will be a really good one.","April 27","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

It's a rogue-like, road-trip, driving/mechanic simulator. With an Uncle with a reality breaking acid trip of a jacket.\n\nYou have to keep your POS Jalopy Laika 601 in working condition. Driving on a road trip (not finished yet it is alpha) with your Uncle. Dealing with border guards that remind me of Papers Please. Choosing a route to drive sometimes the lesser of very bad options. Which leads you to...\n\n...Driving through the country side with a broken water tank for my wipers and every turn causing more mud on my windscreen, while I have a trunk full of contraband (I opened it later) in locked crates. I manage to get out of the forest onto the main road the town in site in the distance. I hit the roundabout just outta town and all of the sudden lose control of my car as I drive onto the roundabout hill. Out of gas. I grab my empty fuel can outta the trunk (used it in that dam forest road earlier) and walk into town with my wallet. Get to the store grab a full can and a crowbar I find and head back. Stash the crowbar wait for the border just in case those crates are sealed. Drive the car into town get the window washer fluid, and crash at the motel. Next morning get across the border, and open up those crates at a gas station. Full of booze sell for a profit. Uncle doesn't mind bootlegging I guess.\n\nGreat game lots of potentional.

There's just something about it that's so charasmatic and keeps drawing me back. As for the graphics, some are saying they aren't at all good, but I think it fits the game perfectly, a bit of cartoony and a hint of gloomy reality, and for being developed by a small team(?), it's very impressive. By far one of the most origional games of the past year, and I look forward to further updates and improvements from the devs!

This game, is holy cow its great.

A few hours of gameplay, and you know the purchase was worth it. This will be one of those games, that goes to my "favourites" tab, simply because this is a game that will get more than a test run from me, this is now life. And I love it.

To give a sumary if you havent read the game description yet, you have this car, a laika 601 deluxe which in reality is a trabant 601, you get it at the begining and you have parts in the yard you asemble the car piece by piece with and then you and your uncle i belive plan to drive it across post berlin wall fall europe ( if its not europe, sue me, your here to drive a car not study a map, btw this game has an actual map you use as a route selection menu!!!). The main driving purpouse of the game is do keep driving and go through towns and checkpoints, but what happens in between is where the gameplay comes in, since this isnt exactly a reliable vehice ( hence the name of the game) many unexpected occurences will happen on your "just pasin through" journey, your car will have its parts deteriorate and you will need to use the great thing that is capitalism to fix it, along the road over various terrain you will find boxes, some that are wooden that are locked and require a crowbar to open and others where all you need to do is literaly peel back the tape, if you have the space or dont have a crowbar you can save time and just put the whole box in the back or on top of your car if it has a roof rack. Inside you will find anything from nothing to wine bottles which you sell along with anything else at the gas station in the town you are going to or at gas stations along the way to it, with this money you will maintain your laika by buying repair kits with 3-4 uses to improve the condition of your parts, but once you have enough you will buy upgraded parts from laika dealerships in the town you go through and holly crap there are like 3-5 sections for each part in which there are like 7 options, these will preform better and last longer, you can also do some visual but useful upgrades like a bullbar which reduces vehicle damage, a roof rack which gives more storage space and little bitty mudflaps which reduce the dirt spread onto you vehicle whenever that is a possibility, some parts you can find on other abandoned laikas on the side of the road ( i have only seen one so far) from which you can salvage some upgraded parts for free. these are just some of the features of this already great game, at the moment they are still working on making the second border but you can just keep respawning at home from the pause menu to redo the journy which is fun because there are many diffent routes that change visualy each time and no one is the same, you can keep doing this to get money to upgrade your laika to prepare yourself for the full game and the journey ahead, fyi i would love a sequel of this or a dlc or an update ( ik what am i saying this game isnt even done yet) where you can drive an old dodge charger or something like that through arizona or the us or have the abilty to buy and use multiple cars, cant wait for this game to be finished\n\nquick review:\n\npros: realy chill driving experience, very immersive, very detailed, must have for anyone into cars especialy hardcore "roadkill" style mechanic work infront of a gas station just workin away ( just do yourself another favor and look up "roadkill" or "roadkill episode playlist" on youtube)\n\ncons: little buggy but you dont notice to much 1 or 2 major bugs, even on my amazing pc it runs in 20's or so for a few seconds at gas stations and drops frames probably because of it not being optimized or finished\n\n10/10","May 13","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm totally hooked despite my utter failures so far.\n\nBoth times now I've run out of fuel, the second time it was in town but I forgot my wallet in the car and got locked inside the compound selling fuel, unable to leave and get my wallet.\n\nExcellent fun messing around with the car, and I love the prospect of upgrading. But how do I earn money to do so?\n\nAnd something else, my god is it hard to control! The worlds tiniest crosshair means I'm constantly squinting to click things, frequently opening my door when I want to look at the map or removing part of the engine instead of filling it with oil.\n\nI'm going to bed now... but I'll be back to this one to see if I can get that fuel tank upgraded and maybe a spare can on the way!! Assuming I can afford it...\n\nFor now, I want to see it being a little easier to interface with things in the game and I also feel the speech bubbles are a little instrusive in their current form. Maybe controller support would help? I'm loving the idea of this game in VR as well...\n\nRecommending it for now as it's frustrating and fun at the same time but I can see many a rage quit on the horizon, and not necessarily because it's difficult, more likely the difficulty in interacting with things...\n\nEDIT: Having had another try I'm infuriated by how dark it got so fast, driving around unable to see a thing. Is this intentional? Also all text is tiny and the crosshair is even smaller, PLEASE remedy this! Maybe a fun feature would be to have our companion comment on what he thinks may be breaking/broken and need repair? The stock equipment is awful (intentional I know) but so far I've come across no boxes to make money to replace parts and even if I did I don't think I'd make it anywhere before the car broke down or it got too dark to see.

Not regretting.\n\nI love the concept. You drive an old DDR car (Trabant, or "Laika" as it is called in-game) from town to town. While at it, you also maintain it, fuel it, clean it, etc. It is not a car mechanic simulator 2016, but I think it has a good balance between simulation and user friendliness, considering not every player drives/owns a car in real life.\n\nThis is a pre-alpha review, so expect a few bugs. Nothing that breaks the game permanently, but something that might roll you back to your last save stage. These include your Laika becoming the Laika and participating in space program by catapulting itself to stratosphere. Usually happens when crossing a wooden bridge.

Finally made it to Hungary and now waiting for the update. This is amazing game so far with a lot of potential, and it being simple makes it easier to build and update, giving quicker rollouts and announcements. Being an RPG of a car and a man with his uncle, you make your own story as you remember how you broke down right past the border of Czech republic having to walk around 20km with a canister in your hand and $10, but with the bug existing you will certainly have no money and a ruined car when you leave and get back.

The stability is improved and graphical glitches have been reduced. The base gameplay is unchanged but it was fine. The biggest problem is that your motivation for progress is killed when you "beat" the game by reaching the end which is not really the end because the whole journey isn't complete and because each trip route is randomly generated it may take some time before the devs build an entire country. So for now it's like a typical car crafting game where you drive around for stuff to scavenge or sell to turn your junk ride into a fast and durable piece of junk. All it needs now is a seperate free mode where you can roam and cause chaos with cheats to your hearts content to kill time till the next update.\n\nI would recommend it to anyone who loves cars so much that they name theirs but as for casual players who think of driving as a chore and can't figure out how to change a tire, I can't say it is worth it just yet.

Some really interesting things can happen such as the time when I saw a HUGE box on the side of the road. I drove to the petrol station to sell it (I only had £10 at the time!) and I open the box and it is full of Stoff, so I sell it and make £2 off of it because Stoff is worth 20p each. As this game is in early access, there can be several glitches such as the hotel randomly moving messing up the game, Uncle's lines being all glitchy and things like that. The radio does work, and has some pretty good music. Only downside is they haven't fixed the optimization yet - my computer has an Intel Core i7-4510U (2Ghz), an NVidia GeForce 820M and 8GB of RAM - and even on mid settings at 720p still drops frames sometimes.

The game is good. Suffers from a handful of bugs, and being VERY hard to earn a decent amount of money without spamming the 4 tires at the beginning. Nothing that can't be ironed out during early access.","May 29","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Just leave the car behind and start walking.\nThat saves you all the fuzz and let's you explore the world and see all it's errors close up.\n\nCould this game be any good?\nYes, if they spend like another year or 2 on active development. Right now it's not worth to invest your money in it. It shows potential and that's an empty promise.\nTime will tell if the developers can turn jaopy into something worth playing.\n","June 6","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/_Midnight_Shadows_/recommended/446020/","_Midnight_Shadows_","Midnight Shadows","http://steamcommunity.com/id/_Midnight_Shadows_/","126 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWonderful, Even in its early access state this game is great. It took me a few runs to manage to lug my car all the way to the end of the last stage of the game so far but it's fun! The generated maps are also really awesome, not knowing what you're going to find or where you'll have to go is just awesome.\n\nWhat I love:\n-The game has graphics that are different and artistic, it stands out.\n-It has a story. Most driving games don't have stories, or they do them very poorly, this one does it pretty well in my opinion.\n-The excitement of not knowing what I'm going to find next, if my car is going to make it, so on and so forth.\n-The customization of the car (Even if its limited currently) You can get modifications for your car, roof rack being one of my favs.\n-The idea of space management, you actually have to manage your inventory as you can only fit so much in your car at a time you really have to think about what you want to bring with you, one wrong choice and you'll have to walk with your wallet to the end of the level or to a gas station and hope they have the repair kit or fuel or thing you need.\n\nWhat I dislike:\n-Some of the space management, The car has a back seat yet you can't put anything in it, I think you should be able to put a few small items in it, and if not why not throw some suit cases in there for our characters, why waste the space right? Would make it feel more lived in.\n-Some game breaking lag here and there, it's not too bad but sometimes it breaks the game.\n-World Genning Repeating, Often I get the same area loaded over and over again. This is fine but it cuts back on replayability, I don't know if it's just me, I've seen areas in screenshots that I've never gotten before but seem to have the same areas over and over again, there will probably be more variation as the game goes on but still.\n\n10/10 for early access. Would play over and over again, have played over and over again.\n\nI reccomend this to anyone who's looking for a casual artistic game, it's been done very well and even if they stopped making updates it still feels like more work has been put into it than most full release indie games recently.","June 6","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
