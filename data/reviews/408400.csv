From what I understand, this version is a graphical and interface upgrade, but the main game play and story is similar to what I experienced originally with some modifications and some things that are more fleshed out.  If I get a chance to play this iteration, I will update this review with more comments.\n\nOverall, I would recommend the game if you like old school, grid based, movement type RPGs that were similar to the original Might & Magic games with good pacing, class and spell design, balanced with some challenging, but fair game play.  While the graphics will not compete directly with AAA modern titles, the monster portraits and game scenes can still be quite appealing to look at.  Another big plus for me is you can actually have 6 party members so you can have one of each available class in your party and they are all quite useful including a Fighter, Paladin, Archer, Thief, Priest and Sorceress.\n\nOLD COMMENTS:\n\nI had time to download and play the demo for a bit yesterday and was able to pick it up pretty quickly even without looking at the manual at all. It was familiar enough to the old classics that I was able to jump right in. There are a few mechanics and tactics I didn't try yet, but the basics of fighting, buying/selling, and equipping the party were pretty straightforward so far. It probably helped me a lot that I played the old classic Might & Magic 1 last year as much of the original interface was very similar. I must say that I liked the option to inspect an item and it would show you which class could use the item and damage stats, etc. Also, when I tried to equip a shield while already wielding a 2h weapon, it popped a yellow message up explaining to me that I already had a 2h weapon equipped. I wasn't expecting that level of feedback.\n\nI got my party up to level 7 and unlocked the 4th tier of spells. At first I was a little bummed there would only be 5 tiers of spells, but all the spells are pretty useful even though there are only 4 priest and sorc spells per level. The total spell count may be lower, but the actual usefulness of them seems to be very high compared to similar games.\n\nAt first I didn't like the way water/holy water was handled and the sorc runes that you needed to loot to cast the more powerful spells. However, now that I have been playing a while, it just feels right and I can tell there was a lot of thought put into how it would affect game-play and strategy. It is a nice twist on a familiar mechanic.\n\nI was concerned a few times whether I was progressing in the proper manner/order in game, but never ended up being frustrated. By just exploring each map systematically, I was stumbling into all relevant and important events (I think). A few times the monsters seemed to be a bit over-tuned, but then I would soon uncover an item or spell that made them a lot easier to deal with, so I would say personally the game flows very well and the difficulty is just right.\n\nSo far the game hasn't grown stale at all, which I am pleasantly surprised with. The pace that new enemies show up with new tactics and the pace that you grow in power through new items and/or spells seems to be just right. I am quite impressed you did this alone. Your efforts at polish in game-play show. Granted, this is ignoring some of the graphics and re-usable sound effects, etc, but concentrating on the core tactics and game-play, I am getting a good experience.\n\nNow I am genuinely interested in finishing the game, or at least progressing further. If there are 15-20 areas/maps? I guess I am only about a third of the way through and easily have over 10 hours into it already I would say. The encounters are already getting pretty tough so I can only imagine what you have in store as I get into the end game.\n\nEND OF OLDER COMMENTS\n\nI now recall that I never did finish the game to get to the end game content, but it was more due to my lack of focus and ability to stick with one game (any game) than this game specifically.  Perhaps I will give it another shot in this new engine/interface and make it a bit further!\n\nWatch the available video clips and screenshots and if you can get by the interface and older style graphics, there is some very elegant old school RPG goodness in here.","December 15, 2015","true","39.4"," 35 of 40 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","35","40","0","0"

This is an old school grid based RPG with an improved interface. I still enjoy the style of these type of RPG but was unable to go back and enjoy the originals because of the clunky interface. This game with an easy interface is exactly what I wanted, I really enjoyed it and am looking forward to the next game the developer is creating with a similar engine.\n\nSome will find the game very unfair, and especially starting out you will die easy and it seems unfairly. Itâ€™s not nearly as punishing as the original M&M I and Bards Tale I. I actually like starting so weak because it makes the progression that much more visible. Also the combat and exploration have a certain puzzle flavor to them. There are certain challenge humps that are hard to get past but I am glad they are there. I remember particularly a room in the catacombs and some of the lower levels which seemed particularly unfair. It just means you have to be very careful, and also understand how you can use the order of turned based combat, and maybe change some characters speed so they go before others. The thief is very important for some of the special attacks it has.\n\nThis has about 100hrs worth of content if you like to explore every square and it may be hard for an adult to find the time to finish; but since it is save anywhere out of combat and combat is short it is actually very friendly to being played in small chunks.","December 17, 2015","true","15.7"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","18","22","0","0"

I played all the Wizardrys, Ultimas, Bard Tales and Might & Magic Series.\n\nThis game reminds me of all those past games that I have played in the past with its square grid layout and its very engaging storyline. You can also have a team of 6 different members and there are 6 different classes each with very different and unique skills. This game is also slightly different than most normal RPG in that Sorcerers need to collect Runes to cast spells, and Priests needs to prepare a supply of Holy Water. Of course you also need to be near some water supply like Stream or Lake so you can have access to water.  It is little things like this that makes the game more interesting and different.\n\nThe developer also put in a lot of effort into creating different kind of dungeons with different mechanics and behavior that are uniquely distinctive. For example, in the Water Realm, there are currents and you get swept away to different location based on the current. In the Air Realm, you will fall to your death, and can only teleport to certain location using a transdisplacer device. In Earth Realm you might have to re-materialized behind the rock to discover new tunnels, etc. In Fire you have constant Inferno effect damaging you with every move and lots of other surprises.\n\nI love games with Steam Achievements, and it is possible to get all 20/20 steam achievements in a single playthrough. I spend about 70 hours in a single playthrough. This game especially reward grinding and have monsters that repopulate so that you can grind till your heart content. You also get decent drops and experienes through grinding too.\n\nOverall, I loved this game and would highly recommend it to any old school RPG gamers. Its definitely worth the money spent.","December 23, 2015","true","71.3"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","1"

The game has been enhanced since then, and now looks nicer than I recall.\n\nWARNING - This contains many spoilers.\n\nParty/Levels\n\nHuman Paladin - 15\nDwarf Knight - 15\nElf Archer - 15\nGnome Rogue - 15\nDwarf Priest - 14\nHuman Sorceress - 14\n\nDifficulty - The game was much easier than I recalled from 2013, and I while I did recall a little bit tactic wise. (mostly equip all luck bonuses etc and save before leveling up, as the HP/SP can vary massively) I did this last time too. The game really was easier than it used to be, last time I recall the mummies were really tough, this time I killed them all first time every time. Very little was that much of a challenge this time through. I didn't bother with using the cross in the final combat. (I forgot it to be honest) The big bad guy was very easy, only getting to act once, the rest of the time he was imprisoned.\n\nThe Prison spell made combats very easy once I got it, with that and abilities such as Arrowstorm and Godsend especially. Now had been willing to accept random level ups the game would have been more challenging earlier but irrelevant later as my enemies were typically Imprisoned or Stunned.\n\nMy typical end game fight was Archer - Arrowstorm, Sorc - Prison three, Rogue - stun one, once enemies turns have passed, Priest and Paladin - Godsend/heal if needed etc. Finally Knight - Attack/Berserk. By waiting when needed very few enemies would get to act if any.\n\nPersonally I would love to see a difficulty option, for those who like more challenge, increasing enemy stats etc. (speed especially, after a certain point my key members went first against every enemy bar the end boss, and my Archer was still faster!)\n\nNOTE - While I found the game relatively easy, I have played a lot of similar games over the years, I notice others saying this game was way too hard for them so I guess everyone has a different perspective!\n\nPlayability - Great, the game plays very well all the way up to around level 10 or so the game was varied it was only once I learnt the level 5 spells the game became somewhat repetitious. All on that after level 10 or so, you don't unlock anything new, I think the Paladin getting level 5 spells being the last exception, it would have been nice to get a little more late game, for variety if nothing else.\n\nClass/Race Thoughts\n\nPaladin - Other than Astrid there isn't really a decent magic weapon for her, her Godsend was nice enough but it would have been nice to find a Paladin only magic sword. (Unless I missed this?) The best I found was The Blades of Wrath which were obviously designed for the Rogue.\n\nArcher - Most powerful damage dealer by far once I got Burst then Arrowstorm, there is only one super bow of course, so two probably wouldn't be ideal. Mind you 5 Arrowstorms would be amusing. :p\n\nKnight - Solid takes damage and deal it quite well, never deals as much as the Archer/Sorc or Priest though, and even the Paladin can be more damaging once she has Godsend.\n\nRogue - Pretty essential for lockpicking, assassinating and later stunning. Wouldn't take two.\n\nPriest - Probably my favourite, by the mid game. Turns into the highest damage dealer once level 5 spells are reached. I'd suggest two of these instead of a Paladin. Only one gets the cross of course, still would be decent.\n\nSorceress - Great character, and two of these would be amazing, again instead of the Paladin. Two lots of Prison spells would be insane, amazing damage dealing too.\n\nGnome - Once you've hit level 15/16 all your stats are maxed bar Intelligence/Spirit which are a waste of points. I would probably not use a Gnome again especially if there's any chance of importing characters into Sovereign.\n\nThe other races didn't really stand out, so pick the ones you like.\n\nRunes - Early game these were plentiful, then mid game they got low, late game I got crazy amounts, ending with about 2k spare!\n\nHoly Water - I mentioned this last time I played but it's still too micromangery to me, having to remember to cast holy water before resting and such, I'd prefer them to regain to full when resting in the inn at least. Could the Priest get an expanded limit later in the game perhaps? 40 is pretty miserly when the Sorceress can carry 2k+ worth of runes!  :shock:\n\nBugs - I came across several bugs as I went along all of which I reported on the forums and they were fixed usually within days or even hours of reporting! Charles is really on the ball!\n\nImprovements\n\nThe aforementioned difficulty setting would be nice for veterans, the game really is much easier than it used to be.\n\nSpace out the abilities slightly more, having little after level 10 was disappointing. or consider adding the odd extra thing in. Maybe a Paladin can eventually hold a 2 handed weapon and shield? The Priest can have more Holy Water etc.\n\nStrafing - Please add this, would be nice!\n\nFinal Thoughts - All in all I really enjoyed playing through the game again even if it was a little easy this time, and will definitely play Sovereign once it's released, and in fact I'd be more than happy to help playtest Sovereign if you like Charles? I'm good at spotting bugs. ;) If you like playing classic RPG's then give this a go! :)\n\nCheers!\n\nDaniel.","January 1","true","42.7"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","9","11","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mediocrepoet/recommended/408400/","mediocrepoet","mediocrepoet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mediocrepoet/","361 products in account","This game has been a long time in the making. A sort of tribute to the early Might and Magic series and similar games. I've quite enjoyed it throughout different releases and it's true that this newest one is more difficult than earlier versions. But it's still manageable, just like the older games were. Early on, you'll have to be more cautious and should err on the side of saving often since it's not an easy game, but once you have a level or two under your belt, things become a lot more manageable.\n\nIf you aren't familiar with it, this is a turn-based RPG with a six member party that can be created (or you can use the pre-generated party) from choices of six classes and four races. Character creation is fairly straightforward with class abilities and spells being learned at pre-determined levels, though at each level up and during creation, you allocate a few points between your various attributes (e.g. strength, intelligence, etc.). The spells are a mixture between combat oriented magic and more utility oriented magic (such as casting a spell to escape a dungeon quickly).\n\nYou also have to manage your resources such as food, water and magical runes, so you can't rest indefinitely without returning to town to resupply and you need to be at least somewhat aware of how many magical resources you have for spellcasting. In practice, magical runes are mostly a limitation in the early game, but I suppose if your playstyle is more magic intensive than mine, it might be something you have to monitor more actively. Similarly, like in many older games, your gear starts out quite meager and you have to build up to equipment that is decent and eventually, great.\n\nIf you enjoy exploration based games and miss the sort of experience from older, more challenging games (or find the games you play these days too easy), you should give Swords and Sorcery: Underworld a try. I bought it at nearly double the Steam price a few years ago and thought it was well worth it then, it's a steal now. There's also a sequel in the works to look out for if you find this style of game appealing.","December 16, 2015","true","18.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

If this is unfamiliar, then read on to see if this game may be a good fit for you.\n\nWarning: The game is untraditionally balanced and is not for everyone. If you go in with modern RPG expectations and are unwilling or unable to adapt, you will be disappointed and/or frustrated with this game. This game will slap this expectation in the face in the first couple encounters. You can reduce the probability of luck playing a role in your victories by grinding some, but this game presents many tools in combat and many encounters are like tactical puzzles that you'll need to solve before you can survive consistently.\n\nI'm still playing through this game and am deeply appreciative of the developer's responsiveness and taking into consideration suggestions and tweaks. I look forward to future products that they produce.\n\nNoting points, whether they are pluses for some, minuses for others or neutrals.\n\nControls:\n* Use a full-sized keyboard and mouse to control the game with nearly every option accessible by a key alone\n* Keybindings cannot be reassigned at this time, so a mouse is strongly recommended if you do not have a full-sized keyboard with number pad for the NumPad Plus or NumPad Minus to adjust attributes at creation and level ups\n* If you're using a gamepad emulator such as Pinnacle Game Profiler or Xpadder, I would recommend assigning to WASD (or QZSD) for movement and mouse controls at a minimum ~ other options such as Escape, Enter, as well as the letters A through D may be convenient as well\n* There does not seem to be a strafe option at this time, but can get through without it\n\nGameplay:\n* Create up to twelve adventurers, deploy six party members at a time including one that looks kind of like an Arnold-style Conan\n* Choose from one of six classes (knight, paladin, archer, thief, priest, sorceror) with one of four races (human, elf, dwarf, gnome), one of four face portraits per race and gender combo and assign attribute points among seven attributes\n* Level ups have random health and spell point gains based on influencing stat, allow for three attribute points to be assigned, and award new skills or spells depending on the class\n* Options to quick save and load in most locations on most screens\n* Navigate first-person through dungeons, moving one square on the map grid a time, engaging in combat and dialogue, managing party and inventory\n* Combat options allow for moving party members into or out of melee range individually or all at once, waiting or protecting allies, using melee or ranged attacks, using spells, fleeing, using other abilities and possible others that I'm forgetting - to succeed in this game, it is strongly recommend to take advantage of as many of these options as possible while adapting to enemy tactics\n* Combat is turn-based with each character taking a turn per round with the ability to postpone their turn toward the end of the round\n* At least 50 save slots in-game, if not more\n* Sound effects match most actions\n* The music has been intermittent in my game, such as a discovery scene, quest reward scene or the sound of a battle that just turned grim\n* Occasional game crashes and bugs, but the developer has been communicating regularly with the community and addressing these issues\n\nAspects that I enjoyed/opinionated in addition to the above points:\n* Enjoyable art style with realistic art for most portraits and strong contrast on most other aspects that may have a comic-book feel for some\n\nUntraditional Balance and Modern RPG Expectations Expounded:\n* The beginning area is a tutorial area with shockingly high damage values, however, once you adapt to the mechanics, you may be able to easily run through this beginning area without any deaths or the need to save (though saving is recommended in case of an unexpected crash) -- armor does make a difference, but most importantly, positioning can prevent enemies from attacking altogether\n* Dipping your toes into the next area can lead to brutal defeats and force you to scrounge for all your options to counter fear, counter silence on your casters, denying archers clean shots to your healer, changing your leader to a faster character to order people into a safer position or sometimes going as far as leveling a new party member to counter situations in those areas\n* Sorcerors in most fantasy games have easy access to ranged attack spells - this is not initially true and sorcerors may fare better in melee range until you have more runes or until you're a higher level where you do have those rune-free ranged attack spells\n* Initial combat positioning is not static and misreading a situation can and will get you killed - do not assume that your character in the bottom portraits is out of melee range, double check their movement choices and portrait for cues\n\nESRBish/Content Advisory:\n* Mostly nude outline of a spirit woman with no nipples and some enemies in busty garments\n* Some art with female cleavage - do not recall if there are any bare chested men or man nipples\n* Random chance of fighting some violent leopards and you may need to kill them or reload if you do not like hurting animals, even virtual ones\n* Lots of brawling in the streets and in different establishments\n* Ability to break into a woman's home where she sits up in bed startled... just before returning somethings precious to her\n* Well drawn undead and some scenes depicting villagers being terrorized may instill images of unrest in some\n","December 23, 2015","true","13.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/raixel/recommended/408400/","raixel","raixel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/raixel/","495 products in account","tl;dr - This game plays exactly like a game from the late 80s. Start out pathetically weak with no armor or weapons to speak of and pray to the RNG gods your entire party isnt 1-shotted. You're going to have to grind for gold and XP before you can even think about going and doing anything. Nice hand drawn art, minimal stereotypical sound, and some weird UI choices. Its not terrible, but it's not great either. Besides the cool images during conversation scenes, theres not muct to set it apart from the crowd. If it had come out in 1989, it'd be great, but modern grid-dungeons have come a long way since then. I'm only recommending it for hardcore fans of the genre who like games like the early Wizardrys where theres a lot of RNG luck and grinding just to stay alive.\n\n__________________________________________________________\n\nThis is an true-to-the-late-80s turn based dungeon crawler with interesting hand drawn graphics. The graphics are rendered in great detail, with plot scenes being shown with static full screen brightly colored comic book-style art.\n\nWhen I say "true to the late 80s", I mean it. Unlike many other games that took what was great about that era's RPGs and left the rest, Underworld really makes you feel like you're playing a game created in 1990 but with a unique art style.\n\nYour characters start out pitifully weak with nothing but an extremely low level melee and ranged weapon. No armor, no gold, One slap of the RNG god and you're going down to a random encounter due to how pathetic your characters are- one hit knockdowns are the norm until you reach level 2 and/or get some better armor  and even at level 2 they're very common.\n\nFortunately theres an "unconciousness" state that incapacitates a char before death, but one hit while in that state and its off to the temple to pay a fee for res. To get even semi-decent, you're going to have to run around town grinding random encounters for gold to get your chars even marginally equipped. I feel like I'm playing the early Wizardrys here. Did I mention how much I *hate* grinding? I did way too much of it in the actual 80s, I guess. There's a reason many RPGs dont have grinding anymore, its not fun to most people. Fortunately, there is an item repeatably dropped by a certain random enemy type you can trade to the guard blocking the catacombs for 100g and 20xp. Unfortunately, you have to run all over hells half acre trying to encounter that specific enemy type. Oh, and you can't just level, you have to train which costs gold. And it takes a *lot* of XP to level, but all you get out of it is 3 skill points.\n\nTheres a mini-map in the corner (thank god), and apparently a larger world map that has places of interest marked. I still like making notations on maps - guess it comes from my graph paper and pencil days. Still, the minimap is nice - no graph paper needed. Once you get yourself equipped, you can head off to the catacombs and continue the plot, which revolves around a giant demon somehow being released and taunting the party when you leave the inn. Of course you are told by someone that your party has a great fate, which is, of course, to try and stop the demon.\n\nTheres also sidequests. I'm currently doing a fetch quest at level 2. Level 2 seems to be a bit easier, not so many one hit knockouts. If this game progresses like most of the 80s games, you should get strong enough that the grinding isn't as required once you're out of the early game, but its still annoying and not a good start to the game.\n\nThe UI has some weirdness. Like most games of this style theres a bunch of quick icons on the HUD (char sheet, rest, system etc). I find it odd however, that in order to cast a spell you must go to the spellcaster's char sheet, then hit enter, then select the spell, but theres a quickbar icon for the tutorial. Which is a player going to use more? The tutorial, or the spellbook? But yet theres no quickbar "cast spell" icon?\n\nAlso, to pick a locked door, you must bump into the door, which flashes "locked" on the screen. Then you must select the "unlock" icon. If you fail the picking, instead of just hitting unlock again, you have to bump into the door, get the "locked" message, then hit "u" or click the "unlock" icon all over again.\nFor some unknown reason, when you fail picking a lock, it makes the same sound as the noise of someone going unconcious in combat. Which sounds like a punch/swing, and then a thud like someone getting hit and dropping to the ground. When you fail to pick a lock. Why? The first time I heard it, I thought there was a trap that went off. But no, thats just the noise it makes. The sound of succeeding to pick a lock is what youd expect, a metallic tumbler shifting and *click*. So why the weird fail sound?\n\nSpeaking of sounds, they are minimal at best. Theres a nice bird sound when you're in town. However, it plays even in areas that would be considered "inside". The rest is just the typical grunts, clangs, swoosh, growls and so on that are standard in RPGs. Nothing like that cool weird chant the brigands made in Wizardry 6.\n\nOverall, Underworld is just OK. If you're a fan of the genre, its worth picking up ON SALE. But I hope you like grinding.","December 24, 2015","true","2.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","9"

That doesn't mean this game doesn't have depth, but you can tell the designer wants the game that comes in the box with three 5-1/4" floppy disks instead of one.

Funny enough. I like this heroic comic style. I read some of the discussion and soon got the impression that it's really tough. Bad thing. I hate games which are frustrating me even in the tutorial.  Why did I buy it then? Who knows? Divine inspiration maybe. Or just the graphics which I still liked. Or perhaps because it wasn't too expensive and some little gnome in my ear said: "If you buy it and it's b******t, well it's not that much damage done. Furthermore it's X-mas soon, and you could look at it as a little present for those poor indie devs." However, I bought it.\n\nAnd it's really tough. I mean really tough! Really really tough! Those enemies knock you out like flies. It's ridiculous! But hey, wait. There is strategy to be applied in a fight. Learn your enemy, learn how he acts, learn what works against him. And suddenly - you walk out of the fight victorious and unharmed. While your enemy still could have had you for breakfast with a single blow. Wow! It's hard to believe, and I am still not sure I believe it - but I like it. In an hour or two you won't make much progress, but you are proud as hell on what you achieved. To be honest I didn't buy that "very rewarding" bull I was reading in the discussion. But you know what? It IS very rewarding. Just to win that fight is rewarding. And of course never forget F10 (quicksave). So what can I say: Thumbs up and continue the good work, guys!","December 17, 2015","true","8.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This is a fairly hardcore old-school grid-based dungeon crawler a bit like the old Might and Magic games. It does not do a lot of hand-holding and your early fights will be very tough. The graphics are hand-drawn and colorful almost comic-book style art. Not a lot of excess bells and whistles to be had. Again, very old school. If you like old-school style party-based dungeon crawls (with six classes and four races) you should check this game out.\n\nOne bit of advice- early on, find the Arena so you can make some money and earn your first level. That helps a lot with the one-shot insta-kill you will see for a good chunk of the early game. One or two levels make a lot of difference.","December 16, 2015","true","3.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I played the earliest version of this when Olderbytes first put it out it was great then and even better now.\nIt really feels like what the old New World Computing folks did (minus an outdoor area, coming in the sequel) and brings back great memories of my first RPG (M&M I), while still being fun and with a very nice art style.\n\nThe game is not easy at times, but you also don't really need to grind either (most levelling is just done via exploration especially after the first underground zone).\n\nMy only critques would be the lack of remapable controls or volume sliders (the game is rather loud compared to other games/media on my system) but those are minor.\n\nGive this game a chance if you like old school RPGs - you won't regret it.","December 21, 2015","true","26.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Each of those games were finely honed to be exasperatingly difficult but achievable.\n\nThis game pits your party of 2-6 hp adventures against monsters who do 74 damage per hit in the tutorial room that you first appear in.   Party Creation to Party wipe in four mouse clicks courtesy of a single Vigilante and then back to the Party Creation screen.\n\nIn my opinion, the developer(s) have taken the idea of a critical path far, far too literally.   I was supposed to walk two squares forward instead of one forward and one to the right.   Note:  there's no prompting or visual cues that one of the seven doors you're presented with is the "right" way.   There are no clues even to what kind of building you are in to let you know that maybe some of the identical doors are instant death.    This is literally the first split second of the game after it's told you the controls.   You are in a room.   There are seven doors.   Here are the movement controls.   Oops you're dead.\n\nTalk about worst foot forward!\n\nEDIT: Read the comments for this review to see the developer responding to constructive criticism.   Also, please note that this review was for the initial launch version and not the version currently being offered.","December 16, 2015","false","0.3"," 18 of 38 people (47%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","47","18","38","4","4"

There was a VERY steep learning curve and battle was definitely not for the faint hearted. The old "save often" slogan is a must in this game.\n\nOnce I got used to the holy water and rune system, I managed to slowly get on top of the game. Its not very generous on loot, in terms of equipment, but that only adds to the challenge. By the time I had cleaned out the town, catacombs and barracks and managed to defeat the arena, I felt I had a handle on it.\n\nTHEN I got to about L7 in the dwarf city and, all of a sudden, the game went into crash mode. Granted, the session I had just started was just after an update but whatever it was has broken the game and I just cant bring myself to go thru the pain and anguish of cleaning out the Catacombs and Barracks all over again.\n\nIts a shame that the game is buggy as it had real potential IMHO\n\nIf the game wasnt broken, I could easily recommend it but, as it stands, I simply can't do that\n\nUPDATE - Developer was very helpful and has updated game which appears to have heavily reduced the crashes and made the game very enjoyable. It still suffer from some sort of memory leak which frezzes you up occassionally but that is a minor hiccup and in no ay detracts from the game.
