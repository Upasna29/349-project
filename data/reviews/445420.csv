"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PhleBuster/recommended/445420/","PhleBuster","PhleBuster[Fruitbat Factory]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PhleBuster/","138 products in account","An unforgiving, highly tactical SRPG, where your troops persist from one battle to another.\n\nAselia is quite old by now, but it deserves to be called a classic. The story is grim but captivating and incorporates some unusual ideas, like the protagonist being at first unable to speak or understand the language of the world he's summoned to. The worldbuilding is remarkable. The real meat, though, is the challenging gameplay where every choice matters and which involves absolutely 0 luck.\n\nAselia has 7 main endings, and fully completing it can easily take 100+ hours. For that, the price point is ridiculously fair.\n\nNorio Wakamoto voices 2 characters in the game. For some, this might be worth it for that alone.\n\nAlso worth noting that Aselia is a prequel to Seinarukana, which is coming on Steam later this year, and I recommend playing this before it.","April 30","true","33.5"," 63 of 69 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","63","69","2","13"

And by played, I mean obsessed. And by obsessed, I mean I played through every single permutation of the game (colloquially referred to as a 'route') twice. I think the grand total was well over 100 hours of precious life, but it was preciously spent.\n\nAselia is one of those high fantasy stories that really grips you. It tends to hold nothing back, and is very challenging in both its strategic/tactical aspects and in its themes. The themes of said story are pretty excellent, ranging from social prejudice and slavery all the way to love, obligation, and duty (heehee).\n\nThe gamplay portion, which is very significant if viewed through the lens of a typical visual novel, is challenging and diverse. There are units to train, squads to create, buildings to build, and tactical decisions to be made in the face of time limits, finite resources, and the ever-onward march to victory.\n\nThe narrative portion of the game, which is still significant, is very excellent. Fans of high fantasy and gritty takes on alternate world transportation will enjoy the plot, while the average anime fan may be surprised at how dark the story goes.\n\nDon't be put off by the graphics; despite the age, this is a top-notch game. The art itself is a style unique to the developer, and while the sprites evoke nostalgia the "cutscenes" and events are well-done.\n\nThat they're selling this game at normal price for less than $20 is a steal. If it's ever on sale, buy immediately and kiss your weekends goodbye. Fans of Fire Emblem and Final Fantasy Tactics will jump right in to the style of gameplay, and everyone else will be pleasantly surprised by the depth of both the tactics and the narrative. Look forward to literally hours and hours of enjoyment.","April 30","true","1.0"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","27","30","0","0"

The soundtrack is amazing! The characters all seem to have quite their own personality and vibe about them. The story is developing very nicely, and I love how the original japanese voice acting is incorporated into it for each  of the characters. The subtitles are visually appealing and very well-structured. Definitely a game I would recommend checking out if interested in the Visual Novel & RPG genre.","April 29","true","15.2"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","16","24","0","0"

Now that I'm replaying it in preparation for the sequel that finally came out, and I am finding that I still love it. I will also mention that this game originally had erotic scenes in it and while they weren't exactly removed gracefully, they are few enough that you can easily ignore the hints that the characters got it on offscreen.\n\nAs for the basics of the game, it's a strategy game where you place and move your units around the map to get into scripted battle sequences when they meet. In between battles, there is a visual novel style story about the main character trying to cope with being brought to another world and forced to fight for a king he doesn't trust.\n\nPut simply, I am a huge fan of the story and the battle system was fun enough that I actually turned up the difficulty after each playthrough when I was replaying the game to go through other routes instead of powering through lower difficulties to get the battles over with.\n\nThe first thing I have to mention is the beginning of the game right after the prologue. I'm going to gush a bit about a stylistic choice made early on, so feel free to skip this paragraph. Now, I've found that very few developers have the balls required to actually have the language of the fantasy world NOT be English (or in this case, Japanese). The foreign characters in this game initially have lines voiced (and written in) in a made up language that, while obviously unknown to the player at first, is very clearly translateable. The main character is implied to spend a very long time just picking up the language when he comes to the world, but the game goes one step further by asking the player if *they've* actually managed to start picking some simple stuff up (That might sound like a horrible decision, but they don't throw you entirely into the frying pan and the results barely matter if you really don't care enough to bother; it's just for scoring a few points with the girl taking care of you). Now, the dialogue boxes eventually switch into English when the main character gets better at the language, and by your first battle, the character voices are all in Japanese instead of the fantasy language, indicating that Yuuto is fluent now. You can also switch character languages to Japanese for the whole story when you get to New Game+, but that entire process shows a level of care and dedication to the story that is honestly very rare in the games and shows I've experiences and I have to give it credit for that.\n\nAnyway, the prologue starts us off pretty slowly, but the rest of the story is quite enjoyable with multi-dimensional characters and some fun twists throughout. As mentioned before, I enjoyed both the story and gameplay immensely, though a walkthrough of choices to make to get each ending would probably be a good thing to look up on your second and subsequent playthroughs. Combine this with a multiverse lore that is just ripe for sequels and spinoffs and you have a great game to spend some time with. This is seriously a great game to check out.","May 5","true","38.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It has a beautiful storyline with lots of twists (some of which you don't see coming), fantastic interaction between characters, the choices you need to make to enter a character's route are a bit subtle, so here I recommend using a guide, and most importantly, for me, actual high repalayability value (which isn't true for a alot of VNs). What I mean by that is that each route has a (sub)storyline and missions unique to that route which makes each playthrough different enough from one another that you don't want to just give up on the game and move on. Basically a bit of strategy is required because what worked on one playthrough might not work on another. If you don't understand what I mean, play the game a couple of times and you'll see.","May 4","true","31.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

The story has pulled me in and the combat is fun and sometimes brutal. If you like either of those genres as well then you will enjoy this game. The game does show its age though so as long as you can look past that then i dont see any flaws with this game at all.","May 5","true","29.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

What's more, it's entirely voiced.  I totally expected the voices to swap to Japanese after the protagonist learned it enough, but nope - it's actually consistent, or at the very least what appears inconsistent at first is given an explanation.\n\nOnce you pass the prologue of the first hour or two, the story becomes rather engaging through its attention to detail and setting, to the point where even the everyday slice-of-life parts manage to become more engaging than those of Clannad, at least prior to its full-on nakige/crying game moments it's known for.  The gameplay elements, while not frequent enough to be the only reason to play if you want to ignore the story (which would be very unfortunate) manage to be challenging enough to remind me of a simplified version of the cores present in games such as Etrian Odyssey or the SMT franchise.\n\nDefinitely worth a purchase.  The art quality is shaky even compared to others of its era, but if you can get past that, it's a great game that manages to stand tall alongside similar stories at least twice its price.  As an introduction to the genre something like Katawa Shoujo might be less difficult, but if you're interested in VNs at all I feel at ease giving it a recommendation from my current experience.","May 3","true","8.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Both parts are executed really well, with the visual novel parts maybe taking up an a bit bigger portion.\n\nThe introduction of characters and setting, and the build-up towards the first battles may feel a bit long, but once you get there you're rewarded with highly strategic (zero randomness) , turn-based RPG, which also boasts a great story. And once it gets started it really picks up pace, both in terms of story and difficulty.\nSince this version of the game also includes the expansion it allows for a total of 7 different routes and 9 endings.\n\nThe battles quickly become very tough, combined with perma-death (and a straight game-over if a main character dies) you may end up requiring several attempts for certain battles. Especially on the higher difficulties one poor battle can see you losing characters, which becomes all the more painful thanks to all the side characters having their own story and background.\n\nAlso of note is that this is the prequel to Seinarukana: The Spirit of Eternity Sword 2, which just saw it's official 'English release and will be released on Steam later this year.  Definitely a recommendation if you're a fan of SRPGs and like a good story to go along with it.","May 7","true","46.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

So I decided to stick with it and see what happens. And once the game hits Chapter 1, I think it really starts to find its groove. I actually really like the presentation of Esperia teaching you how to speak the local tongue of the course of some months, but I may be a sucker for the Florence Nightingale effect.\n\nI haven't finished this yet (just beat Chapter 1), but when they finally gave me some gameplay to the visual novel, I was quite surprised by the depth of the tactics and planning I had available to me.  I do think the UI could use a little more polish but it has a sort of GBA FE7 feel that appeals to me.  It's clear to me that the game is a bit old and using some retro looking effects, but I've found it charming so far.  I'll likely update this as a I go, but I'm liking what I'm seeing so far.\n\nI'm not sure I've figured out","May 3","true","49.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"
