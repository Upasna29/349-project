By night 3 you are being completely over run.\n\n--Previous Review; All points are valid--13 DEC 15\nI fully recommend this game—conditionally for v0.987. My only other survival game experience is ARK and Forsaken Fortress. Thus, my survival game experience is limited to those games, so please keep that in mind.\n\nPROS/Subjective (My Opinion)\n-Scary as hell--monsters can freak the living crap out of you. I spent one of my nights on top of a rock surrounded by zombies and other aliens. Sniff* Sniff* Shriek*; is all I heard for the entire night…while trying to figure out what I was going to do in the morning.\n-Great Sound Effects\n-Good Graphics\n-Good storyline\n-Well thought out overall game design/foundation\n-Structure plotting\n-Entertaining resource hunting\n-Fairly easy to get the hang of\n-Finding Water is not as hard as people think it is, but not being able to drink or even collect beach water and filter it later is wierd to me\n\nCON/Objective (Fact)\n-Still fairly buggy because it is early access, just something buyers should to consider and be aware of.\n--I have only experienced three to four blaring bugs that need fixed, sooner rather than later.\n\nCON/Subjective (My opinion)\n-No player customization\n-No player skills/talents/progression of any sort\n-No structure customization, just base design (*all structures are pre-designed and only require X amount of resources to build. Player made structure/plotting designs would be awesome and fix this CON for me)\n-Very limited weapons choices\n-Limited resource selection/variety\n-Only one save file\n-Currently no multiplayer\n-Alien spawn rate needs to be adjustable on "new game" or within an options menu. Possibly an ability to disable it completely for those who want to just “build a base” and get to know the game for a few hours.","December 13, 2015","true","7.8"," 38 of 57 people (67%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","67","38","57","5","0"

I'm running a 780Ti and have absolutely no problem pulling 60 frames per second.  Its well designed and gives a lot of attention to lighting.  There are numerous locations on the map to explore and discover, each with its own set of challenges, creatures, and resources to tackle.  In fact, if you're going to build out everything in the game, you're going to have to do some exploring.\n\nSurvival:\n-- To me, survival isn't vastly different than most games in this genre.  There is hunger and thirst.  Hunt for food (at least five different types discovered so far)  and collect water.  Yes, the game advertises other survival metrics, but they don't seem to play a huge role.  Stamina is really only about how fast you can cut things down or throw a spear.  You're able to sprint indefinitely.  Hot vs Cold (at least in story mode) only seems to apply when walking in fire or in a couple of "cold" locations that you can quickly dip into, get what you need and get out.\n\nAudio:\n-- Aside from the voice acting (which could use some work) the audio is really solid.  The island makes so many different noises from regular ambient noise to the various creatures on the island.  In fact, early on, until you've learned the noises each critter makes, the audio can really keep you on the seat of your pants.\n\nWeapons:\n-- So far, I've found six weapons, I believe, which really helps in  survival.  So far, I haven't felt the need to build many traps.\n\nStory:\n-- The story is pretty basic, so far, but it has provided a really nice motivation to the game.  Everytime I think I'm about to escape the island, I find I need to solve one more "puzzle".  How do i get in here?  How do I get one of those?  Etc.  Its given me reason to explore the island without making things seem easy.\n\nOverall:\n-- If they keep developing the game it will really shine but, as it is, its a good spend for $15ish.  I think I'm about 10 hours in and can see myself spending a few more (I really want to figure out how to get off the island).  Multiplayer would be a nice touch, but maybe just for survival mode, not the story.","March 26","true","14.2"," 22 of 29 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","22","29","2","0"

As the warning about the latest location is announced one happens to appear locally. Moments later you blackout, followed by waking in what seems to be another dimension, dreamworld or perhaps limbo. Might sound a little same old but it's quite well presented some of what separates Vortex from other survival sims imo.\n\nAfter waking you find belongings scattered about, collecting these helps to guide you further. Each item picked up automatically shows available blueprints, giving ideas for crafting and your next objective. Like most survival sims, the objective is to survive. Surprise! In daylight most animals encountered were seemingly passive, setting up the initial camp wasn't too challenging. When things get dark however, the game changes, things go bump in the night. While minding your own business and harvesting resources, don't be too surprised when a giant vortex appears over head dropping headhunting aliens into the world. Other then watching enemies, will need to satify your hunger, thirst along with keeping warm. Nothing too complex, personally I like that. Saving could be done using a tent or house once it was setup, did not run into any problems with loading or corruption.\n\nPerformance could be improved but quite respectable given the amount of detail on screen. If using a low-end system the game should still be playable. Runs on unity, screen resolutions of 4k+ were supported along with the standard quality settings, no options available in-game at this time. Another pretty solid survival sim, which makes two in a week, almost gives me some faith in steam again (almost!). Copy was provided by developer, doesn't change my thoughts. Cheers.\n\nBRIEF LAUNCH EDIT:\nUploaded fresh gameplay if anyone is interested\nPerformance is a bit hit/miss, otherwise I'd still recommend it.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuyvI09u3O4","October 10, 2015","true","3.8"," 73 of 121 people (60%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","60","73","121","9","6"

Here is what I am loving about this game so far:\n\nPerformance-  Running maxed out and getting about an average of 40 fps (gtx780, 16 gigs ram, i7, etc.).  No crashes or bugs as of this posting.  While good probably will continue to need optimization as it develops.\n\nVisuals- Game looks fantastic and very atmospheric (great work on the skybox as well).\n\nSound- This is where the game is a 10/10 already!  The sounds in this game will have you on the seat of your pants especially at night.  Not to much and not too little just enough to get your imagination running wild.\n\nEnvironment-  Plenty of area to explore, great foliage, various animals to hunt, creatures that hunt you (very scary at night),   Resources are available but you do have to venture out and explore.   Hope to see island/landmass increase over time as indicated.\n\nCrafting-  Works well but UI could use some fine tuning and current carrying capacity should/could be either increased or allow for additional containers to be crafted.  You can craft a storage container out of bamboo but doesn't seem to currently offer option to store extra items (bug?).\n\nResource (water/food)-  Food seems to be plentiful but the water is currently hard to find and limited.  I do think the water consumption rate needs to be looked at as it depleates too fast in my opinion.  Will be nice to see more animals added that you can hunt (really fun).\n\nStory- Yes there is actually a story/plot!  While limited now I hope to see this expanded upon...where are we? Why are we here?  Can we escape back to Earth? etc. etc.\n\nHere are two videos from my livestreams that will give you a good sense of how the game is as of this posting:\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_clRwKGyXY4\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgG_HCkJ9_U\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pyMR-G7XVU","October 7, 2015","true","10.8"," 51 of 84 people (61%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","61","51","84","4","0"

Think The Forest** without crazed, mutant tree jumping cannibals.\n\nThink instead.. somewhat crazed, strange aliens, some who live here anyway.. and some sucked here like you and your companions via a vortex.\nDont get used to the companions.. they dont hang around long.. as in just long enough to get you started.. then.. well things happen.\n\nUnless your playing in Survival Mode, which is you tending to a wounded comrade and trying to survive.. the only difference between the two is that instead of looking out for yourself.. your looking out for him also.  I advise you dont start in that mode. I did and it does not include the helpful advice that Story Mode does.\n\nGraphics wise.. Not bad at all.. I have seen better.. but I ve seen worse.. and its not system taxing.\nIt is a survival game. You save via your base house ( like a lot of them do these days )\n\nCrafting is easy, minus the part that you have no idea where or how to get a few things you need.. but that makes it better. You are on an alien planet, you have no idea what is what. Of course you can just look it up via the information on forum etc.. But my advice.. Dont. Enjoy the not knowing at first. It is not hard to figure any of it out. Normally in the form of pick something up and then you know.\n\nThe control setup seemed confusing at first.. as the listed controls are for controler and PC both.. and I could not get them to change. But it didnt really matter because they are all standard setup anyway for KB / M\n\nOne thing I have not made up my mind about yet.. you cant sleep time. IE.. I built my house. Trust me.. night is scary right now.. like the Forest when your getting started.. but no way to fast time it. So I spent my first two nights hunkering in fear at the sounds around me, hiding behind my fire.. which thankfully seems to scare off a few critters that came running full tilt at me.. keeping my back to my hut wall.\n\nIts not a bad play at all so far. I am even scared that my next day will be my last.. again.\n\nBTW. Happy Birthday.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=687727843\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=687727910\n\n** I refer to the Forest, which could be considered a competitor to this game, or vice versa simply to get the idea accross.  When I say its like the Forest.. I mean it. If you recall the Forest about midway of it's EA life.. This is that, only the things that want to eat you are different.  It is also a bit slower paced here, yes.. easy to die early if you have no clue.. but the enemies are not so unforgiving.\n\nConsider this a bit more low stress. My daughter is scared to death of the cannibals. Aliens she enjoys.","May 19","true","2.1"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","15","19","2","0"

While there are many survival games out there today, there are few that are built around single player.\n\nMy feeling is that this game originally intended to be released as a multiplayer game, however was instead released as a single player game with a weak story line. I'm speculating this, when I consider the almost non-existant story, and the limited set of craftable items that don't make sense in relation to the actual game mechanics themselves.\n\nThis is a retail game that feels like one that is in Early Access.\n\nHonestly not worth it.","March 27","false","1.1"," 27 of 42 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","27","42","0","1"

However I have got to say that this game keeps you on your toes. There is no time to chill out and have a picnic. Provided you have the right strategy you should be able to survive. People say they die too quickly, that is just because their strategy sucks. Keep getting thirsty? Then build your base where you know there is a water fruit node nearby! Keep getting hungry? Pull your finger out and do some hunting! Keep getting killed by dragon? Stop prancing around like julie andrews all over the hills and be a bit more stealthy! Everything else killing you? Stop swinging your machete like it's the only weapon you can get and make yourself some spears which are sooooo easy to make! It takes some getting used to I am not going to lie but how boring it would be if there wasn't a challenge!\nSomething I will say is that while there are a few hours gameplay here and some nice areas to explore it would be so much more fun with a friend, but watch this space because 2 player co-op is planned! Well done devs! Make it happen!\nThere are downsides too but they seem to be far out-weighed by the positives. This game has the potential to make you jump with some heart-pounding sounds and an atmosphere that a lot of people will feel on edge in. Again this is where people get stressed...it's like trying to teach a kid to sit on the toilet. They flip out because they have to stop have everything done for them and do it themselves.\nAll in all not a bad game AT ALL. Performance could be better get around 25-30 fps but there are no lags and although the creatures can look a bit strange and not as attractive as some games the atmosphere combined with these is spot on.\n","December 26, 2015","true","20.8"," 22 of 37 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","22","37","0","0"

There are also quite a few other issues like the lack of a good in depth tutorial, it seems like you just hit the ground running (maybe thats how it's supposed to be?)

Gamers like me who were kinda being a d1ck about the framerate issue.\nSo I apolligize to Stormcube publicaly in this review for my rather harsh words. I feel really bad about my haste...\n\nJust gonna keep this short and sweet. I have liked this game a lot from the start. I have not been playing it much due to the fact I was just waiting for an update.\nThe Devs have recently release this title from EA. And have already had an update to help improve performance.\n\nIt has a cool feel to the game. A little like other survival games wrapped up in one. Now for me I will not claim it will run perfect for everybody. BUT, for most it will run good.\n\nPROS:\n1. Stormcube Games. They are worth it.\n2. Nice in-game species of different aliens.\n3. Sound is good but not great. The ambient sound need more subtlety.\n4. Crafting is pretty damn easy. Not over done and yet still viable.\n5. Does have a good ' What do I do next' feel to the game.\n6. Animations. Way better now then in the beginning of the game. Not the best, but have definetly seen a whole lot worse.\n\nCONS:\n1. Graphic settings tied to screen resolution. I personally am very annoyed by this.\n2. Not enough options for sound and graphics.\n3. Ambient sounds, although soud fine, need to be adjusted to show distance. Some ambient sound is really hard to tell how far away something is.\n4.

The beginning intro to the story has a 'farcry' or 'dead island' vibe to it. I personally like that that.\n\nAgain, sorry to Stormcube Games for being an impatient little b1tch.

And while it does have some decent visuals, that seems to be about all it has going for it for now.\n\nThe overall performance of the game on my system was not great. Movement and action were a bit sluggish. I'm not sure if this was due to my computer performance or if that is just how the game is currently functioning. I currently use an AMD 6300 FX 6-core processor, 12 gigs of ram, and an AMD Radeon R7 with 2 gigs of memory. Not a top of the line setup but it has no problem running "Subnautica" or "The Forest" or any other game, now that I think about it.\n\nThe build mode and user interface leave something to be desired. To build something, you have to first gather a type of resource. A stick, a piece of bamboo, some leaves. THEN you get to see what you could possibly build from these. This is something that "The Forest" does way better. Everything you could build is already there for you to see with a list of what you would need to collect.\nBuild mode in Vortex is all through the ugly inventory screen. You select what you want to build, hit the little hammer icon, place the item and start throwing resources at it. But there isn't much to build just yet.\n\nCollecting resources isn't the best. You start with a machete and use it to cut plants. So far, you can cut down a piece of bamboo and get 3 bamboo logs. But when you hack at a tree, you get nothing. Hack at a leafy bush, get a seemingly infinite supply of leaves. Hack at a shrub, get a seemingly infinite supply of sticks. This is another thing that "The Forest" has done very well. In that game, you can hack down just about everything and basically clear cut a huge area while collecting resources. In Vortex, it's nothing like that.\n\nOne major problem I found is that falling from any height, no matter how minor, seems to damage the player. It's very unrealistic and kind of annoying when you are trying to climb down a rock outcropping.\n\nThe other thing is that food and water are pretty difficult to collect. Water appears to be almost non-existant. So far, the only water I could find came from a water plant. Hunting for food comes down to crafting some throwable spears and chucking them at these pig-like creatures. As far as I can figure, that is it.\n\nSo to sum it up, this game has potential to be something good. It's just not there yet.

The graphics and the atmosphere was great even at the beginning of early access. More and more creatures are in the game and I hope this tendency will continue.

But vortex is different in so many ways to those games that we describe as having potential, because it does not "have potential" it thrusts potential upon you, and I wouldn't have it any other way.\n\npoint 1.So lets start with things that make it different; firstly the developer. My previous review to this game was not recommended but the game has much improved thanks to the active developer (or developers). after my review was published within a day I had a response from the developer requesting I change my review as they had improved the performance issues previously plaguing the game. here is our conversation:\n\nCornelius the Booty Spooker 26 Mar @ 12:21am\nYou know what? Just because this game looks like somthing i will adore, i am going to do that.\n\nStormCube Games  [developer] 25 Mar @ 10:25pm\nThe performance was improved drastically with the latest build. Please give it a try and reconsider your review. Thanks!\n\nSo as you can see I reconsidered my review because it seems like something I would love.\n\nPoint 2 another thing that makes this game different is the mystery that surrounds everything from the opponents to the very island you stand on. This gives the game a drive and a purpose that not all other survival games can bring a directive that itself is mysterious and makes you continue playing.\n\nPoint 3 Things the game falls short on; technical issues even after several updates the game is still technically not sound. Items can fall through the floor and can be impossible to pick up or, distant trees will appear to disintegrate as you walk from them. these problems are of course, to be expected from an early access game but It wouldn't be right if I didn't mention them here.\n\nPoint 4 Things the game falls short on; It is shockingly similar to other survival games such as the forest. Though these similarity's are warranted or necessary in some parts of the game, I can see how this could turn of players from the forest as they could see this as more of the same. Though I have read this is the better experience, I cannot definitely say because I have yet to play the forest.\n\nIn conclusion the vortex is an interesting game that shows potential more than just saying "look at this cool thing" and its mysterious island and creatures will keep you coming back to play to find out what really happened, however the game is unfortunately bound by other games systems that prevents it from evolving into a completely unique experience.\n\n6/10","March 23","true","8.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","3"

Although the game is still in alpha build, I haven't experienced any crash so far.\n\nAn alpha build is an alpha build. There are many things I don't like:\n- Lack of tutorial/instruction. I spent some time to figure out how to regain water which usually gets depleted very fast.\n- Movement is unsmooth. There seems to be many invisible obstacles on the ground.\n- Combat and hunting is aweful. I had a bit of difficulty to aim my spear at distance. I had to walk close enough to my target to ensure a hit.\n- Lack of animations in many places, such as resource gathering and constructing.\n- Water not drinkable?!\n- Texture quality isn't very high, as a single player game.\n\nSo after all these issues, why do I still recommand this game? Becuase it is in alpha, it has many potentials. Fighting with aliens to survive is quite unique and sounds exiting. I want to see this game being developed further.","October 11, 2015","true","0.5"," 13 of 25 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","13","25","2","0"

It seems that there is a new one released every day. I was skeptical at first but I was drawn in by the game trailer video and screenshots. It looked interesting so I thought I'd give it a shot.\n\nOne thing that sets this game apart from the other EA Unity releases is the story. The game begins at a party with you having a good ol' time dancing, drinking and socializing. Faintly, you can hear a TV news report in the background spewing some information about a black hole or Einstein-Rosen bridge....wait, what? Then the sky turns purple and it begins to get interesting. Next thing you know, you're on some alien island with stuff thrown about.\n\nGame play is similar to other games of this genre where you run around exploring a large land mass or in this case, an alien island, gathering supplies and crafting tools, weapons and other useful items. You start out with a few basic supplies to get you going but they will not last long. You will need to get to work gathering nourishment quickly. There are a few animals running around, screaming loudly, that you can hunt for food. I did not encounter a water source but I really didn't look for one either. The enemy or monsters or aliens are lacking a bit as they don't pose a real threat since you can easily outrun them. I actually jumped on top of something and was fairly safe from one for a while.\n\nThe graphics are well done and the island does indeed look alien. The animals that I saw were unique, interesting and had decent AI. They ran away from me but also attacked me trying to protect themselves as I was trying to attack them. During my game play I only saw one alien whose entrance to the game was spectacular! However, the excitement that his entrance created was short lived as his AI needs tweaking. He was able to track me but he was slow and caused little damage to me as he was hitting me. I was unable to cause much damage to him as I was having issues with dehydration and low stamina.\n\nThe game performed well on my mid-range system with the graphics set to "high". I didn't notice any lag issues or other performance problems. The sounds and music in the game were very loud and do not yet have a volume control that functions. You save your game progress by pressing the 'V' key.\n\nAll in all, even for its initial release, the game is pretty stable and very playable. I did not encounter any game breaking bugs or issues. Of course there are minor bugs and other issues that I'm sure the developer will be working on. I enjoyed my game play and am actually looking forward to playing more.\n\nI do recommend this game and if you buy it while it's on sale I believe it's worth the price. You may, however, may want to wait a few days to see if the developer releases any patches, just to see how determined he is to continue the game's development.\n\nHere's a video of my game play and my initial impressions if you are interested: https://youtu.be/1u6jHEgtyso","October 6, 2015","true","1.2"," 23 of 45 people (51%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","51","23","45","3","3"

They're self explanatory so I won't go into detail.\nWhere the interesting stuff lies, is the backstory and world. During the day, you're gathering resources, and crafting stuff (with a easy to use system) as you normally would expect. However, when the first night hits is where your world is rocked.\n\nA giant vortex opens up, and a Ship beams something down. Without spoiling some of the cool stuff, there are small things like this that keep this from being 'just another survival game". Where most of those have boring worlds, this has an interesting story to uncover, as well as some beautiful scenery. Glowing mushrooms, winding trees, the game looks beautiful. Although, at the moment, the game still needs a good bit of optimization, but it's not awful.\n\nSo far, I haven't really found a way to progress much in the game, so I'm assuming there isn't really much of a goal at the moment. If that's a problem for you, keep that in mind before purchasing the game. It's a fun world to explore, and there's a decent amount of interesting stuff to craft.\n\nOverall, it's a pretty cool game, and I'm excited to see it grow. It needs a bit of polish, and more content, but I'm hoping we'll see the game go somewhere!","October 12, 2015","true","1.1"," 25 of 49 people (51%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","51","25","49","2","0"

I was just utterly bashing on this game. The First Uhm, I dont know 10 minutes of gameplay you can see and find many flaws/ annoying aspects to the game. I actually had a good laugh those 10 minutes that was how terrible this game started off. But I said heck im going to push through as much as I can take, and a hour later I found myself not having a blast but there is alot here, with need of improvement. This is (sorry to Stormcube its just an easy way to compair it) Literally The Forest with aliens and your character has dialog here and there. Every action, movement, even picking up and rotating placement of buildables.\n\nHeres my recommendation, if your just passing by and you think this looks intresting and have never played or own The Forest.\ngo buy The Forest.\n\nIf you own The Forest and have the spare money and like the idea of that setting but Aliens, with a few more kinks and bugs in the game, buy vortex.\n\nIf you cant stand frame rate drops, playing on lower resolution than your typically used to get smooth frames, games that feel sorta finished but missing something, or just the typical rager I NEED MY SUPER REZ POLISHED AAA GAME NOAW.

I had a tough starts, because I always died a couple of miniutes after I walked too far from "home" just because of curiosity. Then I realized I have to be more careful with the fauna, more importantly find water and something to eat. In time I found a beautifully crafted world with it's varied flora and fauna. The daylight's are okay, you can walk away from the danger in time, but not at night. My first night was like a blind man walking around in a pit. Then I luckily found a flame root torch, it was a relief. For saving game I had to build a tent at least. There are other buildable and craftable things in the game but you have to pick up the ingredients first to see what you can do with them. I passed 7 days and nights ingame, it's not so easy to live this long here :) I saw and experienced more and more interesting things in this world day by day.

You can craft items and building your base, which crafting options are already available once you will start the game, you won't need to research blueprints, leveling up or something similiar, or at least at the moment.\n\nThe Alien Island is certanly inspired and beautiful to see, everything is developed in a very creative and suggestive way, instead of fire for example and torches, there is a brilliant gem which you can get which will braight your night, beautiful idea.\n\nYou will start with few items and supplies and your best friend will be your machete which will give you the power to cut trees and hunting. A little note here, hunting the similiar pig animal is at the moment of this review (10\7\15) too difficult. It takes a lot to kill this animal.\n\nWith the machete you can then cut bamboo trees and cutting leafes, building then your base.\n\nAnother really good thing, really appreciate is the background story, something that most of the EAs lack, here the game has some sense and at least the basic information of what happened and why the player is where he is are given. Great the introduction shown with a video as well, really appreciated, but that need to get improved in a longer version by the end of the development.\n\nEverything else is really inspired and will please your eyes.

I felt obligated to stand up and warn all those who might buy this game because they think it is an actual finished and polished product. I have no idea why the game came out of early access, I assume it is because the devs are trying to dodge the stigma that is being associated with alot of EA titles. The game has glitches and bugs beyond number. It had potential and perhaps still does but you should know that while it may have technically been "finished", it is still a early access title. Don't expect much and you wont be dissapointed. I will not recomend this game at this time because I think that going into a "closed beta" period and then miraculously coming out of it with a "finished" product a very short time later is a sloppy and underhanded attempt to grab a bit more cash.","March 26","false","1.3"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","0"

You have to make your own shelter, fire, source food and drink.  You can live like Bear Grylls at least for a while. It's entertaining! Life like graphics, varied use of different tools (machete, lighter  etc) and most importantly your mind the most useful of all. You can be as creative and realistic as you like. Jungle like forest, knee deep undergrow, beaches, fresh water lakes, rock faces they are all represented.\nAs much as the story line goes, well, I have been entertained by the freedom of wandering around and building a campsite with a little bit of twist. Not going to be a boring game, it's already clear! Changes of days are a great addition. It seems to take place around the Equator though, as night falls quickly, but thankfully sun comes up just as rapidly.\n\nI could recommend it from what I've seen. It will give you a good few nights off from family time, that's for sure.\n\nOne important thing I'd like to point out: play it in a dark room locked away from everyone and use a quality pair headphones.\n\nAs for technical issues: I haven't experienced any annoying thing. Pretty smooth for an alpha build, everything works fine, some features are deactivated that will be available later I guess. My congfig is a dual core i-7 with its own HD6000 GPU, 8Gb Ram and it runs smooth on high settings. If you're a geek, probably you'd run it windowed lower resolution, but the FPS I get is adequate for me. I hardly can wait for the finished version, but I haven't came across any programming issues.\n\nGreat game it will be, a good purhcase for sure!","October 15, 2015","true","7.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

For anyone who played and loved "The Forest".. this game is a MUST-BUY for YOU!\n\nFor being in early access and on alpha right now at such an early state of development, this game is AMAZING!  The graphics and sounds are great, the controls work fluidly, and the game can straight up scare the heck out of you at night when you get the wrong creatures chasing you!\n\nYou start off the game watching yourself at an office birthday party and the news going off about how mysterious worm holes are taking people to some far off place.  Well, for you this is a great thing because it turns out that earth is being invaded by aliens.  The bad thing is now you will be all alone on a mysterious jungle like planet and will need to find a way to stay alive as you find clues and reports of what is happening back at home on the planet earth.\n\nNow is where you get to actually control your character from the familiar first person perspective in these sandbox survival games.  You see around you a few broken pieces of your landing pod and a few items including a bag of chips, a instant food package, a box of grape juice, a lighter and most importantly a machete.  You'll need to pick all of these items up and hope for the best because you'll need it on this alien planet.\n\nUsing the machete will help you acquire recources you'll need to discover all of your craftable goods.  You'll need to find and collect resources to learn how to make items that use those resources in the recipe.  For example, all you need to make a spear is a stick and your machete, but you won't know how to make a spear until you'd cut down and collected a stick.  To make a house, you'll need to find and collect bamboo logs and large leaves and so forth.  To craft an item such as a tent or a house, once you know how to make it, simply click the craft icon even though you will not have all the needed components and place the framework or "plan".  It will stay where you have placed it and be glowing blue until you bring all the components to it and placed them onto it, at which point it will be a completed structure.  Use houses or tents either one to save your game progress with the V key when you are near it.\n\nAt this point, you cannot "sleep" and will usually spend the hours at night looking for items and resources needed to survive.  As with the usual survival game, water and food are critical to survive.\n\nAt night, you'll notice the beautiful fauna that grows in this world as well as a huge earth-like planet that rises over the horizon.  You may also here and see an alien space craft arive in one of the warmholes much like how you got here and this spacecraft will drop a green alien round pod that you may later find as you travel about.  Beware however that aliens will start populating this world and the longer you survive, the more challenging and populated your world could be with this very aggressive alien zombie-like creature!\n\nAlso threatening you are little ostrich like creatures that will definitely take the opportunity to peck you in your back if you aren't looking (I've had this happen a couple of times) ...and a huge very powerful orange wolf type creature.  Add to this the non stop threats of hunger, thirst, getting lost, and more and you have a very fun and addictive survival game that beckons you to come back long after you log out with its gorgeous graphics and glow-in-the-dark atmosphere.\n\nThis game may only be in early alpha, but it looks already to be a survival crafting sandbox game that any fan of such games shouldn't dare miss!\n\n-  Zaxx","October 6, 2015","true","2.2"," 16 of 36 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","16","36","2","0"

The game runs at 5-10 fps on low settings on my alienware, this would be regularly unplayable for me, but I thought I'd try for the sake of a review.

I understand that this is still an Alpha, but please at least make it playable if you're making people pay 20$ for it, or 14$ in my case, because of the winter sale.\n\nThe crafting system is interesting. If you've played The Forest, a game I absolutely love, you know exactly what you're in for, down to picking up and moving 3 logs at a time. I actually thought that the same devs that made The Forest were working on this game, until I looked it up. There's nothing wrong with ripping of the crafting system of another game, as long as it works and you make it your own, but when you break it with a clunky interface and restricted recipes based on inventory items, you've just made it worse.\n\nGameplay is almost identical to The Forest from what I can tell. Start at a location with a small selection of vital supplies, gather up what you can, build a base, and hold down the fort until you die. When I say almost identical, I mean go play an hour of the forest and reskin it to look like an alien planet, now make the mutants spawn only at night. Now release that game for 20$ on steam.\n\nWhat it feels like to me is that the devs took The Forest and said, "I want to make a similar game on an alien planet with a different story but mostly the same vein of gameplay." Then they took The Forest and made a crude copy of it as a foundation to work off of until they are able to develop it into a more individual and unique experience. At least, that's what I hope happened. It could be that they're just greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s out to make a quick buck, but I like to assume innocence.\n\nI would advise any potential buyers to watch this game for a while, maybe a month or two, and look out for how the devs respond to feedback and whether or not they try to improve the game. If you're willing to take a change with that extra Christmas money and get this game, go ahead and give the devs some meaningful feedback, instead of just destructive criticism.\n\nI'll try and update along with the game, but as of now, I would not recommend.\n\nUPDATE: Wow, the devs on this really managed to pull it out of Day One: Garry's Incident territory. Since this review, they've fixed most of my major complaints about the game. The framerate was fixed and the weird crafting system was improved upon, though it still takes a bit of getting used too. At this point, the only things I could really say about it is that it lacks polish. Movement is a bit weird, swinging with a weapon is a bit weird, throwing spears is a bit weird, but nothing realy breaks the game or detracts significantly from teh experience.\n\nThe writing is a bit clunky, but in a loveable B-movie way. Mike is a likeable dude, for all the introduction we get to him, and his imediate exit had me chuckling in my seat. The character's lines during gameplay don't add deep characterization, but they're enjoyable enough, especially the line of "That's a strange being." whenever you see a new animal. Just adds a bit of charm to the whole thing.\n\nIt's an enjoyable experience, and somewhat relaxing.","January 4","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
