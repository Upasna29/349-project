This game has a magical feel to it, and a story to go as well. The music is pleasant to the ear, and the game is very addicting.

This game is worth the asking price, in my personal opinion :)\n\nI will play this game till the cows come home, inbetween other games, and at my own personal leisure.\n\nI Love this game ♥♥♥\n\nOnly 1 down fall, my achievement for getting all the stars in Survival did not activate and pop, must be a bug glitch :(\n\n","June 23, 2015","true","61.8"," 35 of 35 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","35","35","0","8"

If they reach the end of the line before you get rid of them all, it's game over (though I'm assuming you can keep trying after failing).  It's in the Puzzle category, but it's acutally an action puzzle rather than turn-based or one that just sits there while you decide what move to make.  In this game you have to think fast and have good reflexes sometimes.\n\nOccasionally you get power-ups that will help you.  Fireballs that destroy balls.  Color Match that makes several balls all the same color.   There are ones that slow the train or make it go backwards for a short time.\n\nThere are also equipable power-ups that you can choose once you've unlocked them.  Such as unlimited swap of whatever colored ball is currently next in line to shoot.  Or every 10th ball you get is a fireball.   You can try out the equipables and customize the way you want to play the game.\n\nThere is a main story with a path that you follow, but there are also other game modes that you unlock along the way.\n\nGraphics are nice.  I especially like the details on the balls (no jokes please).  They aren't just a solid color, there is a pattern to them that is nice.\n\nMusic is very nice.  To me it has a sort of fairytale classical style.  Kind of hard for me to describe.    It sets the mood perfectly for a jaunt through the creepy forest.\n\nI haven't finished the main story yet.  I might be halfway through, going on the equipable power-ups that I have yet to unlock, but I'm not sure, and I've played almost 3 hours according to Steam.  And I haven't played the other modes yet, either.","June 2, 2015","true","3.2"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","1"

Match the orbs before they fall into the abyss and find your way through mysterious lands of startling beauty!\n\nStoryIt has something to do with you being tasked to collect 5 ancient keys that have been scattered across the lands. The story was the weakest part of the game for me and it felt unnecessary. I think that the only reason it was put into the game was to give you an extra incentive to complete all the levels and to differ it even more from Zuma.\n\nGameplay-It consists of you trying to match up specific coloured orbs and make them disappear before they reach the end of the track. This track winds around and changes each level.\n\nThere are also powerups which can help you take down more orbs quicker aswell as enchantments that makes it more efficient.\n\nIn all the 90+ levels the only things that really change in between each one are the track layout and the order of orbs. This ends up leading to repetitiveness making this the sort of game that you would drop in to play for only a short amount of time. Luckily, there are 3 gamemodes -quest, survival and challenge- which partially saves it from becoming overly monotonous.\n\nGraphics-The visuals are really good. They look nice and colourful, they even went to the extent of putting in a feature to assist colourblind people!\n\nSummary\nPros\n✔ Gameplay is fun\n✔ Powerups and enchantments\n✔ 90+ levels\n✔ 3 gamemodes\n✔ Graphics are nice\n✔ Trading Cards\n\nCons\n✘ Achievement is bugged\n✘ Mediocre story\n✘ Repetitive\n\nConclusion\nSparkle 2 is a fun game which is great to pop in and play every now and then. It does copy Zuma, but atleast it does it well.\n\n7.7/10\n\nLiked that review? I have others!","December 4, 2015","true","5.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

The queue you are shooting at is constantly moving, and if too many balls go past the line at the end of the path, you lose. It's a simple objective, but very fun as the game progresses and comes up with more intricate map paths, and powerups.\n\nThe powerups offer a decent amount of customization and strategy before you go into a level, but I found myself not changing through many because it felt like they didn't do enough to bother with it.\n\nThe powerups in-game are very fun and satisfying. Some do things like move the queue of balls back, where as others will give you awesome weapons that allow you to blast through rows of balls to buy yourself some time.\n\nOverall, it's a very easy game to pickup and learn, but I had so much fun playing it through that I have to recommend it.","December 24, 2015","true","4.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The keys were scattered around the lands, and they still remain undiscovered. You need to find the keys and unlock their secrets, or fail and join to the dark forever.\n\nAs you have noticed it is not a great story but it is the excuse to complete all the stages.\n\nThe objective is to throw orbs to a queue of them making groups of three or more orbs to blast them and avoid that they reach a black hole called the abyss.\n\nWhen you reach some levels, you can add special powers to the "orb thrower" and collect many power-ups that are going to help you to destroy all orbs.\n\nAfter some levels, you are going to unblock the survival mode and some special challenges too.\n\nGraphics are good and well defined, and their art style remember me forests and druids.\n\nMusic is very nice and helps to reach a pleasent enviroment that changes when orbs are near of the abyss.\n\nThe game is not very difficult and its very addictive. You can play a couple of hours and lose track of time.\n\nIt has achivements and trading cards.\n\nNice game to play if you want to take a break and stop to kill monsters.\n\nPD: Thanks to Shade00","December 4, 2015","true","12.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
