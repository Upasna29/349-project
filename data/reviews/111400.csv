It's obvious that the Bunch of Heroes is a low-budget production and not seeking to become the hit. Stages are boring, goals are repeated, but the struggle of the masses opponents turns out to be quite demanding. One of the few elements worthy of recognition in this game is impressive and colorful graphics. On the screen usually happens very much thanks to the constant explosions and dozens of enemies attacking us. Pretty good sound design also presents itself. Shots sounds correctly, like explosions grenades and tear zombies. This does not change the fact that Bunch of Heroes is a game of poor, simple and rather not worth much attention. Theoretically everything is as straight as the structure of the flail.","December 13, 2014","false","2.2"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","16","21","0","0"

If you have it play with some friends and it'll be awesome. I admit I went into it with an "oh I'm playing an indie game" kind of cautiousness but I'm really glad to say I was really impressed by the graphics, music and gameplay. Only encountered bug happened when I was using the Santa DLC, but other than that everything was smooth from start to finish.\n\nGraphics: Really good for any game of this price.\nMusic: Is really funky or rock 'n roll depending on the setting and fits the game 100%, only wished they had a few more songs (just for the sake of wanting to hear more songs of the same style). Does not sound like some cheap soundtracks out there at all.\nGameplay: There's friendly fire, but if you've played games like Aliens Swarm or some other top-down shooter with it you'll know what to be careful, you just need to communicate with your co-op partner. I used Mumble the whole time, but the in-game voice chat seemed fine when I tested it. Personally I think the running/dodging is a bit slow, which is my own preference and didn't affect my experience that much. Another thing is that it was really hard to control waves at first, which lead to me and my partner dying a lot but after playing to the second half of the campaign I learned how to kill them more easily with the gun that you start off with - pick them off one by one while emptying your bullets with them.\n\nThere are weapons you can pick up during every level - they drop in boxes scattered around the level and re-drop after a while, which is useful if you're holding an area. There's an interesting variety of them and you get an achievement for picking up all kinds at least once. Enemies are pretty varied too and I had a lot of fun with them.\n\nIn short:\nPleasing to the eye?: Yes\nMusic?: The soundtrack just screams good quality, not something like the 'hastily tossed together' type that some games, even ones with a higher price range, do. Personally I wish they had some more songs cause there's never too much of good music!\nAddictive or not?: I played through it in a few days, but playing with a friend is strongly recommended! It's a game I'd be willing to play again, but never by myself.\nPlaytime: Around 5.5 hours for the campaign and there's also some other modes with continued waves of monsters, etc. All in all pretty good length and provides good entertainment.\n","April 4, 2013","true","6.8"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

Сам геймплей поначалу только усиливает это ощущение. И на Земле, и на негостеприимной Красной планете наши герои жгут, взрывают и всячески уничтожают толпы ходячей мертвечины и ее приспешников. Врагов много, на любой вкус: тут вам и радиоактивные зомби, и зомби со штыками, и особенно крупные нацистские генералы, и инопланетяне на летающих тарелках, и какие-то зомби-циклопы, и даже агрессивные курицы-убийцы.\nКонечно, игру здорово выручает кооператив, где, в отличие от сингла, плечом к плечу могут сражаться все четверо героев. Но и тут не все идеально. Нет краеугольного камня любой совместной драки — возможности прийти на помощь павшему или раненому товарищу. Герой лечится и возрождается сам, а когда умрет три раза, то просто покидает игру. Из-за таких вот недоработок и испарившейся на полпути фантазии Bunch of Heroes и превращается из потенциально феерической и дико увлекательной трэш-комедии в просто забавную аркаду на вечер-другой.","July 18, 2013","true","12.2"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

The laser manages to go through things and not damage them at times. (The laser fires a single beam straight through everything in its path. This is p. egregious when a glowing trail is fading and enemies are unscathed in the middle)\n- The enemies get more invincibility frames than you do.\n- Even when given twice the time to trigger, achievements rarely pop properly.\n- Some of the enemies actually fire completely independent of the direction they face in. A few spawned pointing south, I'd run around them as they finished an animation, and BLAM shotgun from the eyes in the back of their head.\n- It's still not worth a) paying for b) playing at all or c) even trying when sites like Kongregate or Armor Games have 500 ♥♥♥♥ing games that play better than this in FLASH (probably with better art design) for free","October 16, 2012","false","0.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

These are just some of the repetitious objectives you will find in Bunch of Heroes. It's an okay 4 person coop top view shooter that lacks a few key ingredients: 1) You better invite your own friends because no one plays this, 2) The weapons are underpowered (or the aliens are overpowered) so killing one alien takes a lot of bullets, 3) No weapon upgrades.\n\nThere is a small assortment of guns, but they are really stingy on the ammo so most of the time you are left with the default weapon running away while you repeatedly reload. Health packs and power ups seem few and far between as well.\n\nThe game could have been improved by offering a tiered difficulty system depending on the number of players in the game, much like Borderlands.

This game literally has no balance between single player and multiplayer, the game will always assume that there are 4 people playing and therefore the game will always scale towards 4 people. This makes single player survival pretty much impossible, not only that, but the gameplay itself is monotonous and utterly trivial. The special ability of each character is complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and will get you killed almost every time. The entire game mechanics is a ♥♥♥♥ing joke. The only few useful guns in this entire game is the laser gun, rifle, chain gun, and one gun that shoot sparkly missiles. You don’t regenerate health, mob variety is ok, but their artificial intelligence is laughable at best. Save your money and don’t buy this disgrace of an indie game.

It has four character classes which other than slight variations in the special attacks pretty much play exactly the same.  There is no leveling or skill building of any kind.  No local multiplayer, online multiplayer is nonexistent and I can't blame anyone for not playing this.  There are also several broken and unattainable achievements.  I doubt those will ever be fixed since the game has been out for 3 years now and the developer hasn't corrected them by now.  If it wasn't for the Holiday Sale of 2011 I would not own this game.
