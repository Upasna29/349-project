This game would have been cutting edge in 1995.  Sadly it is about 20 years late.  I give them props for trying but this game simply does not deliver.  Buy it when it is on sale under $1 because it is barely worth that.\n\nThe joys of bad programming/translationI got a few hours into it and suddenly it crashed out of nowhere.  I loaded it up again and when I tried to load a game it just said leerer slot (empty slot in English).  I selected the English option at load but who cares if the entire game is in English?  Everyone knows German, right?  Of course an empty slot didn't load either and crashed the game.  Pfft, who would want an auto save?  Or simple logic not to load a null game?  That is way to much work.  If you get more than a few hours into the game it is already over, what the hell are you still playing for?\n\nBlue line "features"Random blue horizontal lines will show up out of nowhere.  Yep, cool feature.\n\nCutting edge graphics/animationHave you used paint?  Can you draw a stick figure?  If so you could probably create better graphics than this game in about 10 minutes.  These graphics are simply amazing... in 1995.  I can't draw but I could have found someone who could before releasing this garbage.  Simply lazy like most of the game.\n\nDon't do itYeah all the cool kids say it is awesome but don't fall for it.  I love my German bretheren but there are standards and this falls well short of anyone's standards let alone German.  If only I can save one person from forking over their hard earned money on this garbage I will have done my duty as a citizen of the human race.","April 18, 2015","false","9.9"," 308 of 367 people (84%) found this review helpful 77 people found this review funny","84","308","367","77","21"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/icydeadppl/recommended/359370/","icydeadppl","icydeadppl","http://steamcommunity.com/id/icydeadppl/","137 products in account","This is nothing like legendary city-building games like 1602 A.D. or The Great Empires Collection. If you're hoping for a new age version of games like those, run away. It does not offer levels of difficulty, random maps or modes and it has minimal resources. It offers minimal settlement, resource and character management. Map customization or settlement decor options are severaly limited here. You can only play on a solo map that consists of the ability to add/remove palm trees, add/remove a dirt road, and... nope, that's it.\n\nThe short tutorial that's available in the beginning lacks an emphasis on the importance of building a wharf and having a fleet for raiding early on and the role raiding will play in the early development of their settlements.\n\nYou will start out with access to nine basic buildings with the ability later on to unlock a total of eighteen on your adventure. There are only three upgradable buildings which are key to how those aforementioned buildings get unlocked in the build menu. There are no other forms of upgrading available to resource buildings or housing therefor your settlement never shows change as it grows, nor can you increase production like other strategy-simulation builder games. You can only place more of the same buildings and choose what resource you want it to farm. Once you have a small thriving settlement, you expand land ownership on the island and repeat until you've filled your island with happy little pirates.\n\nRaiding is an interesting addition to this strategy-simulation builder game. A level three wharf allots you the ability to build three types of ships, each with their own advantage. Types of raiding are broken down into two categories, land and sea raids. Each type of raid will allot you three choices for what you wish to raid. Each offer a different level of difficulty. The more ships and crew members in your fleet you have, the percentage for success in those raids rises. For a nice twist, crew members aren't recruited to be crew members only. You have to give your pirates a break from their jobs to go on a "booty call" which may compromise your entire production if you do it at the wrong time.\n\nWhich brings me to mention your population. Unlike most other games of this genre, you don't have an increase of population merely because you've built a home for someone to move in. Houses are used in this game to provide a place for the pirates to rest. New additions to your settlement are pirates you've picked up on successful raids which means if you fail a raid, *cue music* DRN! DRN! DRN! ...you may also lose a members of your crew. If you lose too many of your pirates in a raid, you won't have enough to run your settlement and therefor must start over.\n\nThe user interface design is kept simple and easily accessible. You will have a menu at the bottom that allows you to build, assign workers, worker overview, raiding, military overview, time adjustment and options. Not a lot of asking yourself,  "What do I click to control or see the yadda yadda?"\n\nThere's your five bucks worth of fun. The game is new and does have potential to offer much more. It lacks a few things you may have found in other games like this such as milestones, goals, trading with AI settlements, random acts of misfortune, different maps and a marketplace. But there's so much the devs can do with it from what we have here and they just may in the future. (Pssst. Tsunamis and shipwrecks would be off the chain, yo! *cough cough*)\n\nAt this time, the game quickly reaches a plateau where it no longer requires involvement from the player. If five bucks for five hours sounds good, go for it!","April 18, 2015","false","5.2"," 70 of 85 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","70","85","4","1"

It's very much like Tropico 2, albeit it a very dumbed-down version.  There's only one map (no random map generation), less resources, less buildings, and less to do overall.  Then again, it's only $5.  As such, I would ONLY recommend this game to people who find Tropico, Anno, and Banished to be "too much".  For those comfortable with the complexity of such games, you'll probably find this one to be a bit too simplistic.  I personally can't recommend it because I'm of the latter crowd and Tropico 2 is hands down the better game, despite its age.  That, and there's a bug currently that remembers your progress on the compass when you start a new game...that is, the needle indicating how close the British empire is to finding you DOESN'T reset when you start a new game.  An endless mode is thankfully available, but still...I'm just hard-pressed to recommend it.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID7cVN0asWg\n\n\n","April 18, 2015","false","1.0"," 44 of 54 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","44","54","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/masbroo/recommended/359370/","masbroo","gebratene indomie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/masbroo/","87 products in account","First of all: I've seen a lot of people comparing this game with Tropico 2. And since I don't have it, I won't be able to make a good comparison; but there are perspectives worth looking at.\n\n1. The graphic: Please, what do you really expect from a game that's just a little bit expensive than a smartphone game? Still a lot of room to improve though (e.g. the raiding scene with the ships leaving the port, instead of just having one ship model with different masts, it would probably be better to have different ship models for different missions to prevent boredom)\n\n2. The sound: Not bad, although it does sounds quite cheap, But again, for 5 bucks it is already a decent service.\n\n3. The gameplay: Very linear: gather resources, raid, repeat. You'd probably stopped playing after a couple of hours, BUT in comparison to big names like the Anno series (I've tried 1404 and 2070) or Banished mods, the production chain in this game are a lot easier to master; the tier 3 buildings rarely need a lot of tier 2 or tier 1 building to function properly, which makes the game easier to learn.\n\nProbably the biggest turn-offs in this game is the multiple repetition: You started on the same island, the same resources, the same starting place, and progress the same way.\n\nBUT, knowing how these small budget games work, I might predict the futureof this game: MODS. A lot of it. Yes, it might make the game more difficult, but if this game want to be much more playable, the developer DEFINITELY have to let ppl make mods for this game, ranging from small graphic changes to a new resource chain and new ship types.\n\nStill; a fast food meal set would probably cost the same (or a couple bucks more expensive) but it'll just fill your stomach for a short time; this game, because of its simplicity could be played again and again, even between short one-hour break.\n\nIn the end, this game really worth the 5 euro or 5 dollars spending, and I'd like to spend another 5 euro for more content, like easy misisons, more maps, more ship texture, and a couple of small extensions.

You get what you paid for and, to be fair, it is pretty fun. There are some pretty frustrating mechanics and flaws in the game however, but I still would say it's worth the money you spend.\n\nPros -\n-Entertaining enough to be worth 5 dollars.\n-Has a semi-helpful tutorial that explains the basics.\n-Management feels relatively easy and clean.\n-Graphics arent bad for five bucks, music is bearable as well.\n\n\nCons :\n-Tutorial doesn't explain some key things you need to know, such as happiness management\n-There is nothing you can view that I found that actually tells you why happiness is at a certain level (Maybe each pirate seperately?)\n-Same Island over and over again.\n-No autosave\n-Remember button (To remember set ups for your fleet so you can send it back out immediately) Doesnt seem to work, or I couldn't figure it out.\n-Auto assigns pirates at random to buildings it seems. So if you have unemployed level 2 pirates for your brig, and just enough to run it, you might accidentally send one of them to work somewhere on accident\n-Very little information on VERY important things.\n-No control over specific pirates or where they go/what they do.\n-The raid menu shows a TON of items that have no explanation to what they are (I keep getting brown looking bananas. No idea what they do)\n-The "Goods" section of a depot shows you everything you have. But that is the only way to see what you have over the 5 or so things at the top. Beer is important as well, as is different types of food for different levels. You get all your food crammed into one number, and only get shown rum.\n\n\nSome insight into the above-\n\nThe good:\nThe game is pretty fun, and you'll probably be able to get your 5 dollars out of it. Rocking 2 frigates and a brig I was able to attack the third level targets, and I don't think the navy was after me yet (The navy comes after you when you become a big threat). The tutorial tells you which buildings do what.. kind of. All of this I figured out without using the tutorial, but then found it after. The building management is easy, as is resource managment. The only problem I ever actually ran into was having too MUCH of anything and having to build depots  to hold more stuff since your main building maxes out at level 3.\n\nAnd the Bad:\n-Let's be clear. I like this game for its price. but there are a lot of things that actually made me quitefrustrated. Lets start with the pretty useless tutorial. I expect a tutorial to explain the base game mechanics. What the tutorial does is teach you how to place the basic level buildings and build roads. That's it. No explanation on how much food each pirate eats, no explanation on what makes them happy at what level, what they need at what level, how to level them up, how to get the stuff needed to build the upgrades that ALLOW you to level them up. nothing. This isn't a huge deal, some of this stuff is easily found out by digging around in the item. But some of it isn't and I didn't find a way to figure it out before my game crashed and lost ALL of my progress to that point.\n\n-Happiness. Let's talk about happiness. As a pirate captain, you need to keep your crew happy, or they revolt against you and game over. How do you keep them happy? No idea. The game tells you that pirates at different levels have different needs, and I assume that works into the happiness level. So build tier 2 and 3 level buildings as your pirates work up that high. Spam buildings and hope it keeps it above 60. I never got mine higher than 66, and thatwas with most of my late game buildings.\n\n-Let's talk about population though.. The only way in this game to get more people is to kidnap them. Not a bad mechanic. But when you are lucky to get 1 or 2 people on maybe 25% of your raids, it becomes a problem. Why? Because each building takes 1 or 2 people, and as soon as you grind out enough tools (Only way to get them early is by sea) you get specialty buildings like farms and breweries and the forge. THese each need a specific thing or make a specific thing, and only that one thing at a time. A forge needs coal and iron to work. You have one quarry and one lumberjack? Make two more to produce iron and coal. A farm can only ever make one type of crop at a time, and you need 2 sometimes 3 at the same time. Spam those buildings, baby. Which would be fine in its own right, if you didn't need unemployed pirates to run your ships. 2 to a sloop, your best option early (the brig is largely useless at this stage) and you need about 4 sloops or so to hit 100% success on a village I believe. Thats 8 people you can never have working if you want to (and you NEED to) raid.\n\nThis gets worse later game when the buildings poach seemingly random pirates to run buildings. Have a crew of level 2's to run your brig? Pray to rnjesus they don't get pulled into a building you give workers.\n\nAcquiring new people does get easier once you get later into the buildings, and you can later spam levels so it doesn't much matter who gets pulled. But it seems like a broken mechanic to me.\n\n- No autosave means you are at the mercy of crashes. I don't know why I didn't expect a game like this (no offense) to crash, but I didn't give it much thought. I was only 2 hours in and, boom. All gone.\n\n-The menu showing you what you get after a raid is pretty useless. In 1920x1080, the icons were so small you could only recognize stuff you see all the time. Cannonballs are round. The other 60 or so items, I have no idea what they are, and you can't mouse over them to see an item name. Useless menu.\n\n-The Goods menu on the top. You need different food and different drink for different level pirates, I'm assuming. That's how I *think* the mechanics work. All your food is lumped together into one big number, so maybe that doesn't matter? Rum is the only drink shown, so maybe once you can make that nothing else matters? You get shown clothes, but I am unsure what those do, since running at 0 doesnt seem to make anyone unhappy and having a ton doesnt make anyone MORE happy. Planks and rocks are shown, so that's good. Weapons are not, and you need those to level up.\n\n-The remember button in the Raid section does nothing as far as I can tell.\n\nRant over. It's a good game if you don't expect much out of it.\n","April 17, 2015","true","2.2"," 35 of 77 people (45%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","45","35","77","3","3"

It has the bones to be a decent pirate sim but thats all. You will find no meat here, not even a half way decent tutorial. All you will find is a game that plays EXACTLY the same every single time and there is only a few hours to be had to experience the entire game for the most part. Idk, I was left feeling like I played a vaguely concieved game in just a few hours. With that said, the amateurish visuals coupled with an excellent jobs system for the villagers (Once you teach yourself how it works) make it a surprisingly fun few hours.\n\nSo i do recomend this game if only for more people to ask the devs to put out an UPDATE.\n","April 20, 2015","true","2.1"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

MORE MORE MORE. This game has so much potential. Personally I feel there isn't enough pirate games out there and this game is honestly one of the better ones that have been produced.\n\nI am a bit disheartened that this game isn't in alpha or beta as it feels like one of the many alpha and beta games that steam seems to be filled with lately. I really want this game to be improved upon really badly. This game won't take off unless it has more content and more random situations for the players to experience. This is the sort of game you can only play for a couple of hours before you are bored.\n\nI want to see this game go further or more games like it.\n\nEDIT: Some people are upset that I haven't put a heck of a lot of time into it. For me .4 hours was enough to get a feel of it and post a review. Also don't get butthurt if I don't like your pirate game as much, I enjoy base building games quite a lot and pirate games. Thus this game for me is the perfect combo.","April 17, 2015","true","0.4"," 22 of 52 people (42%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","42","22","52","4","5"

I can't say that I could see myself playing this for hours on end because it is a bit too simplistic for my taste (I prefer games such as Anno 2070, as an example) but it really is fun if you're not in the mood to get too involved.\n\nGiven that it's only $5 I would give it a thumbs up but there are flaws (such as only one map) and bugs/glitches that still need to be worked out.","April 19, 2015","true","0.0"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","4","14","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ReconTFZH/recommended/359370/","ReconTFZH","[Recon]The Famous Zombie Hunter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ReconTFZH/","338 products in account","I'm not sure what everyone is complaining about; As a 21 year old who grew up with classics like the N64 gaming console and computer games like Stronghold, the original Red Alert, Age of Empires II (And its Starwars spin-off whos name aludes me at the moment), and currently play games as "high end" as Battlefield 3, Planetary Annihilation, Tropico 3, 4, and 5, and a myriad of others, I have to say...\n\nThis game is DEFINITELY WORTH THE MONEY! Sure, the graphics aren't anything to rage about, and once you've played the game through once, it can be rather dull from a "Spit, shine, and polish" aspect, but it's built on solid gameplay, the graphics aren't painful, they're just not OHMYGODAMAZING, EVEN THE GRASS LOOKS REAL!!.\n\nMy only complaints with this game in all honesty are; 1. The game was clearly programmed in German first and not entirely played through by the developper when he localized it for English. When your time is up in a normal game mode, the game yells something at you in German about the Royal Navy, then says you won and shows you your score, which had me cocking my head sideways like a dog that just heard someone whistle for the first time.\nAND\n2. At the moment, the game only has moderate replay value. I feel as if it needs a bit more variety. Perhaps 5 levels of pirates instead of 3, and 5 levels of land and sea targets instead of 3 so that there's more than the 3 static tiers. Perhaps add a "Military Convoy" and replace the Merchant fleet with "Small Trader Fleet" and "Large Merchant Fleet", as well as add some new items; Perhaps a farm for fruit tree's, and for upgrade items for pirates, what about "Corsair's Hat" to go from level 2 to 3 instead of parrots, and make parrots level 3 to 4? Then you could add another item for level 4 to 5. Along with that, find a way to add two more levels of ships. Perhaps a Galleon as a level 5, the Frigate now as a level 4, the Brig now as a level 3, and a Barque for level 2? Just my thoughts.\n\nTL;DR\nAs I said, the graphics are nothing to whine about, even though they're not amazing. Given the style of graphics, my compliments to the graphics designer! You did a wonderful job incorporating old-age graphics with new-age smoothness. While the gameplay mechanics are solid, they do lack a bit of variety once you've played the game through once or twice. I highly recommend that the developer continue to develop and expand upon this game; Even with keeping the current graphics (There's really no need to change them, they're pleasant to the eyes and bring back a feeling of nostalgia for us "older" gamers (You know, the ones who helped change the diapers of the younger gamers who are crying like orphaned infants about the graphics being wretched), which helps lend value to the game and make us honestly willing to pay more), you'll be fine. Just add a bit more variety to the game, get a better promotional video, and you'll easily be able to rake in $8 - $10 Canadian/American for the game in my opinion with (mostly) happy players!\n\nCheers, and best of luck to you with your wonderful days-long-since-past reminiscent game! I'm still filled with nostalgia from having played it last night! :)","April 19, 2015","true","5.1"," 10 of 27 people (37%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","37","10","27","2","21"
