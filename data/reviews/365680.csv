Turns out this is actually a creative and interesting take on the Bomberman formula with much more strategy involved. For example, every character has a special and an ability. The girl with the bear as an example can throw a knife with one button and teleport to and/or trade places with it with another button. It is a very intriguing usage of the formula with enough differences to stand on its own two feet. There are of course powerups like in Bomberman, but interestingly the more pickups the character gets, the more they charge up to ultimately use their Ultra ability. The girl's ultra is a very fast and infinite range bomb explosion that can wipe out enemies quickly if used properly. Another neat feature they have included in the game is that you can stack up to two lives via picking up health powerups so if you get hit, you can keep going which can make a world of difference. There are even cool little touches such as indicators on the ground under your character to indicate exactly which square you are on so you know if you will be hit by explosions. There are also visual indicators on the ground showing how far a bomb's blast will go so you can avoid it. Also interestingly, there is a Story mode where the stories of these different dark and gritty characters is told by what seems to be the owner of the Emporium who teaches you their abilities, and also about their personalities and ideas for how to use them. The Story Mode is also fun and strategic due to having to deal with minions and also at times a main enemy such as a boss or other opponent. I am greatly enjoying the game so far and I love the fact that this is a Bomberman-like game with an atmosphere and grittiness of something nearly like Twisted Metal with grim and dark story telling. Also the sound, music, and voice acting are great and puts you into the character and mood of the game. One thing to mention is that the boss fights (in Story Mode) can be quite challenging and can be difficult to survive and come out on top. I suppose though, that the point of a boss fight in most games is to make it difficult and challenging for the player. Overall, I love and highly recommend this game to everyone that loves Bomberman and games like it looking for a very dark, clever, and strategic twist to the formula!","August 13, 2015","true","1.7"," 33 of 39 people (85%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","85","33","39","5","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stubar/recommended/365680/","stubar","stubar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stubar/","1648 products in account","Bomberman is most likely the best multiplayer arena battle game of all time, well in my opinion.  So here we have a modern clone with some twists on the idea.  Main differences are that each character has two special abilities.  One that is reusable on a timer, and one that has limited uses but can be replenished by picking up collectables.  I'm a purist when it comes to pvp, so the idea didn't sound appealling but testing it out in 1 vs 1 local, it was good fun.  It added an extra element to think about.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Vds1XfP3Jh8\n\nThis is probably needed, as the classic game, which would be my personal preference doesn't have so many bonus's to collect as Bomberman did.  You simply get the basics.  Whereas in Bomberman each player would have the opportunity to get every power up, they are just built into the characters in BRAWL.  So it's different, is it better?  I don't think so.  It's still fun though.\n\nI only played in 1 vs 1, as with all arena games, more players would undoubtably increased the fun a lot more!  I've read a review on here saying the multiplayer online doesn't work.  I haven't been able to try it out yet, the playerbase seems very small and my efforts to find other players has been fruitless so far.\n\nI encountered no bugs or glitches, the game seems solid.  Graphics and sound are good.  It's a nice, fun alternative to the classic Bomberman.  Hopefully the community will grow a bit with time, the games only been released for two weeks.  In the mean time you will need local buddies to play against, unless you're happy to kill bots and do the single player campaign.","August 28, 2015","true","6.8"," 25 of 33 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","25","33","3","0"

I've completed all of the campaigns and each character storyline is pretty well put together for a game like this. But when you jump into a local / multiplayer game. It Definitely feels like Bomberman. And it's rather fast-paced compared to the storyline also. My favorite character by far is the Thief. Invisibility and her special dash move makes her really enjoyable / OP in my opinion.\n\nThe game plays well especially with a controller (Have yet to use a keyboard on the game but the controls aren't hard for a game like this).\n\nThe menu/music also added a lot of appeal for me. When I saw the trailer on Steam I was curious but you'll only get a true experience if you play it, and it's quite enjoyable.\n\nOld-school Bomberman fan? Buy this.\nNever tried Bomberman but want a fun game to play with friends or with AI? Buy this. (Playable Singleplayer/Multiplayer/Local-Multi)\n\n+ Great campaign with nice cutscenes for each character\n+ A great number of playable characters along with different models to choose from\n+ Online play / Local play\n+ Can VS bots\n\nBugs? None that I can see. Game is very well made and performs just like any Bomberman game would, except with a huge twist of unique character powers with a brutal theme.\n\nAlso the dev/devs are quite active and helpful.

It is set in a dark world with supernatural toys and monsters. The game plays like Bomberman with abilities and a single player adventure mode. I wasreally enjoying this game and hope to brave it again one day...\n\nHowever, my major gripe is around the difficulty. This is because when you get caught in a duel, which you will  in single player mode, the odds are too heavily stacked against you. At the moment you have to kill them five times in a row whilst also avoiding the hostile mobs. As many Bomberman players know, one or two mistakes and it is game over. This has stopped me progressing as much as I would have liked without swearing at the screen and loading up a different game, and this was on low difficulty! They should have done a one on one battle with the AI being properly scaled by difficulty.\n\nI haven't tried multiplayer yet, but in theory it should be worth getting for this and will probably be more balanced than Single Player mode.\n\nI would recommend this game for highly skilled Bomberman players, and not casual players who want a bit of easy going fun.","August 25, 2015","true","1.9"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","13","18","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/365680/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","For a clone, this is actually a decent game. Although it's not as bright and as colorful as Bomberman is, this game is has an attitude of it's own. Get into a good match online or locally and your set for some fun. This game is actually quite difficult keep in mind (even on the lowest setting)!\n\nThe gameplay resembles that of bomberman except with a few unique features. Each character comes with their own abilities (two to be exact). The Girl is able to teleport and throw a knife. The Toymaker is able to deploy a totem and detonate them. The Sad Clown is able to "sneeze" and confuse. The Puppet Mistress can use her gaze to slow opponents and petrification. The Dummy is able to freeze bombs and detonate them. The Wrestler can charge and smash opponents. The Thief can go invisible and use his special ability, shadow step. The Mine can silence and cage opponents. Of course just like Bomberman, there are pickups available in game to make your bombs better. Some of these pickups include being able to hold and deploy additional bombs, increasing the range of the bombs, giving you ammo to use a special and increasing your health.\n\nAdditionally, players can detonate bombs whenever they please. I'm not sure exactly how the bomb detonation system works as sometimes when I press "detonate", they do not detonate instantly (I'm guessing maybe I simply chose the right player). They have also included the option to take away the blood and gore. I'm sure most gamers will play with it on but it's extremely appreciated to have such an option available. Single player is interesting as it follows each character and their diverse story/history. The narrator can be a bit annoying but does his best to immerse the character (especially when you die over and over). He's sort of corny but the twisted storyline makes up for it all. It is true that this game is sort of hard and some parts are extremely difficult to get through. On easy, some of the levels are possible! Seriously, this game has a steep difficulty to it at times. Opponents come in all shapes and sizes. Some have shields while some are able to eat your bombs! Single player missions will try to diversify by having you protect something or play through levels that are not of equal dimensions.\n\nThe visuals are exceptional. They tried to visualize everything for the player so identifying which bombs will blow up next is perceivable. I definitely like the diversity within the characters. The mood and tone (sound) they chose to introduce this game is appealing even though I'm not a big fan of dark or scary themes (unless it's the Darkness)! The interface is quite friendly and is easy to use. They seemed to really try and nail the details with the music and the quick button switch from keyboard to gamepad.\n\nThere are different game modes available in local. Although the classic version is usually the best, players will also like to try sumo. It's isn't actual sumo where you run into one another. Rather, you are attempting to knock other players out by placing bombs that shoot punching gloves. Color domination is another cool game mode in which you have to try to cover the map with your color. Team play is also possible here by selecting the "Team Arena" game mode. I have to commend the devs here for trying out different game modes. Why not try new things with a completed game?\n\nOverall, the game is better than most Bomberman clones out there. It's still not Bomberman but it's still fun (especially with friends)! Playing by yourself can get a bit redundant. I would say really do your home work and if this does appeal to you, probably wait for a sale.\n\n\n\nRATING : 7.35/10\n\n\nScreenShots :\nFlaunting some of the items\n\nLocal game modes\n\nSumo part 1\n\nSumo part 2\n\nController layout. Love games that do this\n\nUsing a special (against yellow)\n\nDifferent special\n\nPaint battle.

It's basically a modern variation of Bomberman/Dyna Blaster, but way more atmospheric and complex. Your task on each level is usually to kill mobs and bosses using bombs and skills, but there are some tasks and puzzles that have to be completed in a different way. The rooms that you are trapped in are usually quite big and full of traps, like spikes, crates falling on your head or fire, which makes them more interesting and difficult to beat.\n\nYou can play as one of several characters - each of them has its own, individual set of abilities that alter the gameplay. Clown, for example, can sneeze to push bombs onto his enemies or create decoys, and the little girl with a teddy bear on her head is able to throw a knife and teleport to its location, switching places with enemies that got stabbed. If you wish to survive and complete more than two levels of story mode, or stand a chance in multiplayer, you really need to learn using those abilities to your advantage. Fortunately, the game includes a separate tutorial for each of the characters.\n\nApart from story mode, there are challenges waiting to be completed and a multiplayer mode in which you can play against other people (both locally and online). With 6 modes available in local multiuplayer, It's quite fun to play during a party, but be aware that it might not keep you excited for long.\n\nAs I mentioned befeore, BRAWL is extremely difficult and will punish you almost every time you are too slow or make a stupid mistake. In theory, you can load the last checkpoint when you fail, but there aren't many of them, so you usually start the whole level from scratch anyway. It can be very frustrating, especially during those unfair bossfights that can take even up to 15 minutes to complete if you're unlucky.\n\nBRAWL is dark and grotesque, it also features a really atmospheric voice over by the narrator. The optimization is good and the game works smooth even on older rigs. One thing that I don't like about the port are the controls, especially in the menus, where you're unable to use the mouse and have to switch tabs using "Q" and "E". Other than that it's quite fun to play IF you're up for a hard time.","August 13, 2015","true","2.0"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","15","24","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/recommended/365680/","altered_confusion","Altered_Confusion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/","289 products in account","When I first got a chance to play this game on a PlayStation 4 I was jealous of all those PS4 owners out there because I knew that I was missing out on something special, as I don't own a PS4. The thing is that Bloober Team made, in my opinion, a fantastic decision to bring the game to PC, and so I got to really dive into the game.\n\nIn a game where it feels like Bomberman hired the cast of Twisted Metal to play a game of lets blow each other up, you will find the game BRAWL. The thing about this game is that it not only gives you solid gameplay, but something that many of us gamers who have spent quite sometime playing video games as we grew up and that is hot seat play. For those who don't know what this is, it's the ability to play with multiple people on one screen/system.\n\nThe way that they can do this is that they have an almost top down view of the "arenas" so there's no need for split screen, but there's definitely the need to pay attention, and to make sure that you come out on top. In this game you will be trying to collect power ups to make you a more deadly opponent. There are bomb power ups that allow you to place more bombs, there are strength power ups which allow your bombs to cause more damage, and there's also the very coveted health power up that will allow you 1 extra hit before going down.\n\nThere's also a roster of characters that all have their unique talents to help you outwit your opponent. There's an invisibility skill, there's a stun skill, a trap skill, and more. This is a game that you're definitely going to want to play through the story mode for each character. The story modes play out like in-depth tutorials for each character, you will get to learn a little bit of their back story, but at the same time you're going to learn EXACTLY what their skills do, instead of being forced to simply try trial and error.\n\nThis game has local matches, online matches, and also has a couple of different game modes to give you a bit of variety. To me this is a very well polished game with a ton of replay value, and there's a good amount of content to experience to maybe even have tournaments to see who the best is at deathmatches or any of the many other modes.\n\nI don't want to say I was surprised with the seamless transition from the PlayStation 4 to the PC, but I was impressed to see that the game looked as good, ran extremely smooth, and felt like it belonged on the PC. Sure you're going to want to get a couple of controllers so that you can play your friends, and I know that there are those out there who will refuse to get a controller for the PC, but this is a game that must be played with a controller if you are going to kick serious ♥♥♥, and I think that if you are a fan of competitive games, bombs, horror themes, and more, you've got to add this game to your collection. This game gets a 9.3 out of 10.","November 4, 2015","true","1.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Great for local multiplayer but it's a bit of a shame that there are practically no online games on PC so far.
