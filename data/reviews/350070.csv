I've been through nearly 5000 games on my recomendations queue, and I've only been barely interested enough in 200 of them to put on my wishlist.\n\nIf you're like me, and completely jaded by misleading tags, lack of gameplay in trailers, early access games that have been abandoned, ( A flood of RPGMaker, visual novels, poorly drawn anime dating sim, choose your own destiny, point and click, simulation, "survival horror", etc.) games that you are unable to filter out!!!  (seriously steam, why the **** can't I filter this trash out?!)...  Then your poor brain deserves this.\n\nThe point is, this game is a deep breath of fresh air in an ocean of complete excrement.\n\n+tight controls\n+FULL controller support, even allowing you to use the D-pad or the left thumb stick for movement. So I don't understand the "Partial controller support" on the game's features.  (And you bet your *** I'm using the XBox One Controller's D-Pad)\n+rewarding discoveries\n+brilliant and appropriate music\n+awesome boss battles\n+extended end game content\n\n-there aren't enough talented people making games for Steam\n\nBuy it at FULL price, because it's already being sold short!","October 27, 2015","true","19.1"," 68 of 75 people (91%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","91","68","75","9","0"

ESA managed to hold my attention for over 75 hours of exploration, trying somewhat challenging things, and more exploration. This is Hempuli's first commercial release to my knowledge, but he spent about 3 years tinkering with this game and trying to make it better. This is a better-designed metroidvania than Super Metroid was. There's no arbitrarily huge amount of health that you need to recover by grinding off of little enemies spawning out of pipes. You find a save, you get your health back, you fan out in multiple directions and see if you can find anything. The only real negative I can think of when it comes to ESA's exploration is that you don't find some little missile pack buried in each room, stuffed in a wall. You don't get that momentary gratification and pointless increase to the capacity of a weapon you'll never use. Instead, when you find some health or a bonus item, you feel massively more rewarded. That's not for everyone, but it's certainly for me.\n\nI see a lot of complaints about ESA stemming from its difficulty. "This boss has too many phases", "I don't have enough health", "I don't know where to go", all that kind of deal. The boss pacing definitely feels off in a couple of places. Some of the earlier bosses are decidedly more challenging than later ones feel at the time. The reason this doesn't bother me is because each boss actually feels very unique. Each boss has its own mechanics and feels complex in its own way, aside from the first couple of bosses designed to teach you basic mechanics, and the bosses in ESA managed to have more varied and unique design than the entirety of every single 2D Metroid boss. Health is also not an issue in this game. There's an easy mode available directly from the start if you can't progress on normal, and it increases your maximum health, lowers enemy damage, and starts you with more maximum health. ESA also does a great job of directing you to where you need to be if you actually interact with terminals you find after bosses. Similar to Zero Mission, ESA will explain where you need to go through highlighting the target square on your map for you, which continues for quite a long time to allow you to continue progressing and exploring on the way to your destinations. You can also get around the game much faster than it initially seems due to the eventual introduction of a quick travel mechanic, eliminating a lot of pointless backtracking. Save points are generally positioned well and are used to prepare you for a boss so that you have a minimal run to get back to a boss. There are very few exceptions to this.\n\nThe amount of optional content in ESA is also very impressive. There are secrets hidden everywhere, optional upgrades you can find, and with the introduction of a recent patch an entirely new area to explore. On top of this, once you've beaten the main game and reached an ending, you may have some questions about things you have found in the past that seem to have had no effect. This is where your postgame starts, and there are plenty of clues about how to progress postgame that can be found simply by continuing to investigate each unfilled square on your map. The secrets of ESA are not like a missile expansion hunt you would experience in a Metroid game. They are targeted and explained if you look carefully. There are only a scarce few entirely self-contained bonus rooms having little to no indication of their existence; almost all the things you want to find have a directing point somewhere. The postgame secrets are handled in an entirely different way than the traditional metroidvania style and require a different mindset to continue delving into each step in the chain of hidden information, which is a wonderful changeup so late into the game.\n\nThe soundtrack was also handled very well. Every track fits into the area it belongs in and helps set the mood particularly well. The instrumentation used in ESA's soundtrack really goes well with the style of game and manages to call up memories of old SNES titles while not being some shameless ripoff. There wasn't a single instance where I felt "Oh, this track is obviously inspired by another game". My single complaint with ESA's soundtrack is the lack of variance in boss music. There's one track used for almost every boss in the game, and it became noticeable after a while. I definitely would have appreciated a bit of variance in the boss music, even if it was just one extra track on some bosses. Luckily, this isn't a huge issue, because most bosses are intense enough or go down quick enough once you know their patterns that the music doesn't feel repetitive.\n\nThe graphics are the only point where it starts to break down for me a little. For the most part, ESA functions visually, but there were definitely times where I felt that the player character was blending into the background a bit too much. The low-pixel style also impacted how enemies and environments appeared, and more than once I was a bit confused as to what I was looking at until I took a second to inspect it. This isn't a major issue, but I would personally have appreciated more pixel density for ESA so that I could better interpret what was going on in each area. It's easy enough to tell what you're looking at in 95% of the game, but that other 5% is what I wish had more to it. That said, each area in ESA is quite visually distinct and the environments never felt samey or repetitive. Each room, even, is visually memorable, which is pretty impressive.\n\nHempuli's put a lot of time into making ESA great. Any time a bug has come up, it's been fixed as soon as possible. There's still a persistent issue with some people running the Mac version where the game runs at decreased speed or lags, but from what I understand this might be fixed soon with a change in the Wine/Wineskin wrapper and is a result of a recent Mac OS update. Linux, unfortunately, does not jive with Multimedia Fusion. At the time of this review, your best bet is going to be playing this on Windows or using a dual-boot (which I guess people might have anyway because of Linux?), and the Mac version may be improved pretty soon to have few or no issues. There's one issue in particular where the Mac version will not support a controller natively, but using Joy2Key or any other program you like is a very quick workaround for this, and the keyboard controls function totally fine on their own. As far as the content of the game itself goes, bugs that have been reported to be negative for people have been ironed out pretty quickly, and nothing currently stands out as being broken. This is a game which has been examined and improved upon consistently since its release, and I really can't recommend it enough. Hempuli knocked it out of the park and has done all that was required of him as a dev, plus a free update with an entirely new area and its own secrets. Some people seem put off by ESA because of how it looks and from the apparently intimidating difficulty, but I promise that even a little patience goes a long way. I hope those who pick this up decide to keep at it even if a boss initially feels impossible or exploration feels initially unrewarding, because it is ultimately worth it.","December 20, 2015","true","87.6"," 41 of 44 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","41","44","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ChaoticLaw/recommended/350070/","ChaoticLaw","Chaotic Law","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ChaoticLaw/","188 products in account","ESA is a game. It is a game about a space station. You as the protagonist is tasked in figuring out what has happened to it and its survivors. And that's about it for the story. Quite honestly, the fact that things are like that is fine for me. Although it does seem a bit same-y in terms of the sci-fi genre, the story is placed well not only with the various logs and computer terminals that are scattered about, but the environment and the atmosphere that each unique area presents.\n\nThe gameplay is good, and the item progression solid. It feels similar in pacing to Metroid Fusion, but it doesn't handhold you, nor are there long lengths of dialogue or exposition (okay, maybe it's more similar to Zero Mission). Enemies are distinguishable and have their own behaviours. All the bosses have their own strategies so you can't simply tank damage, and each battle a challenge to defeat. Each upgrade you get feels worthwhile and rewarding.\n\nThe sound effects of this game are great. From the various bits and pieces of the station that are still running, the pitter patter of water in the caves, to the heated areas that is the Volcanic Sector--all of it combined with the soundtrack brings its own feel. The soundtrack is closer to the 16-bit era of music instead of the blippy chiptune noises you get from the current nostalgia-hype of 8-bit music, and it's refreshing to hear it.\n\nThere's plenty of secrets to be had even if you finish the game. It doesn't pull the move of locking you into a predefined end-game path; the world remains quite open for you to explore. Health upgrades are pretty important items to find as later bosses take more hits to kill and find more ways to damage you, but that's not the only secret hidden on this station. I thought I'd seen everything, but then another one popped up.\n\nIt might be a while before I truly can consider myself 100%ing the game, but I can say that this game is great, and I recommend that you buy it. Watch out if you think ESA is going to be easy. It's not.","April 22, 2015","true","32.6"," 38 of 44 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","38","44","3","0"

"Spiritual successor" is an apt description.  Metroid 1 sensibilities, but with a lot of the abilities and puzzle cleverness of Super Metroid.  It's really good, and when it's fun it's fun.\n\nBut this game is HARD.  Maybe I'm a sissy, I never got into Dark Souls, but this thing is crazy hard.  Like "neighbors think I have Tourettes" hard, "Smash a controller like it's 1997" hard.  It's so hard I almost want to downvote it, because it's "almost feels like a personal insult" hard.\n\nThis is not the cushy Super Nintendo style Level->Save->Boss->Save progression.  There are multiple bosses in every level, and rarely is there a save point directly in front or directly after it.  Right now I'm at the 2nd boss of the Temple level, and I can't even reach the boss with 50% of my health.  I haven't seen a life tank or powerup for 3 or 4 bosses.  Not mini-bosses, legit bosses.\n\nSo there you have it.

Yes the release day.\n\nAnd let me tell you, ESA is a wonderful experience to play!\n\nThe simplistic pixelated graphics, the soundtrack, the gameplay.. all of it. What really gets me is ESA really sets the atmosphere very well, just like Super Metroid. Even the Controls are spot on with a 360 controller (even if the D-Pad isnt the best, it still plays very well, so you cant blame the game on movement, you have to blame yourself)\n\nItem collecting is very rewarding, boss battles are tough yet fair, everything so far with 3 hours in feels.. Right. Very right, and well done.\n\nHighly reccomend this title to anyone who loves Metroidvanias, or really good 2D platform adventure games. Honestly will be buying this for friends down the road too for them to experience it.\n\nTL;DR - ESA is a love letter to the Metroid Series, and goes to show that this style of games, are not dead.\n\nPS. I really hope they release the Soundtrack to this game, its very soothing to listen to.","April 22, 2015","true","17.0"," 25 of 29 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","25","29","0","0"

(Soundtrack? Yes?)\nGraphics for a Metroid De-make are spot on and lends itself to the atmosphere.\nStory told in a Dark Souls style via terminals and diskettes.\nWorld is expansive and will immerse a player in finding its secrets.\nBosses are well designed with discernible patterns and are challenging to boot.\nThe Bad:\nWeapons tend to frustrate during boss encounters due to range and power limitations.\nLater on, Boss Patterns expect use of the Dash Function to survive, which can lead to confusion in what can and can't be dashed through safely.\nSome bosses can only be hurt by their own weapons and it isn't telegraphed well to the player.\nLife Capsules are quite sparse and give diminishing returns as the game goes on.\nComments:\nWhile I love the genre and I love aspects of ESA, I found it too frustrating to play as some key pieces of the game are counter-productive to the game itself. Judging by how it is designed, ESA borrows heavily from Metroid Fusion/Zero Mission in style, two games which I enjoy and own. However, ESA plays more like a puzzle mixed with a "Souls" game when pertaining to the memorable sections like the boss fights and punishing deaths.\n\nThis is compounded by the initial weapons given to the player and after the third or so boss dealing any significant damage to bosses falls short. In addition, weapon upgrades are hard to come by, but things like the Charge Shot come in too late and feel more like keys rather than an upgrade. The Triple Shot and Supercharge module are optional, but again come in too late and, with the Supercharge module specifically, aren't worth the effort put forth to obtain them. They really should be obtained from the bosses themselves, rather than in some out of the way zone on the map. However, both are optional and aren't needed to complete the game proper, but it hurts the player to not obtain these items as boss fights are punishing without the proper equipment.\n\nIn lieu of that and a few other hiccups, like some bosses being able to hit the player during a room transition, I finished the game. In the end, I don't hate or have cause to bad mouth ESA. It's fun and enjoyable up to a point, but it falls flat and only serves to shoot itself in places where it counts. If you like the overall style and aren't bugged by the shortcomings I found, then it's a worthwhile buy.\n\nUpdate:\n\n<Coming Soon>","April 25, 2015","false","12.5"," 34 of 54 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","34","54","0","2"

Perhaps the best game in recent memory that really captures the (Super) Metroid feeling. However, ESA adds a lot more / more challenging battles and tough platforming-segments. You really need to make a lot of use of your grappling hook and various jumping/dashing abilities to make it through, even when you are not speedrunning/sequence-breaking.\n\nIt is also quite an expansive game with tons of rooms to traverse and even more secret rooms to discover. And it's far from over once you have beaten the "final" boss - in fact, the most challenging secrets will reveal themselves to you only after you have beaten the game once. Unfortunately the difficulty is rather high and you are constantly fighting uphill battles against the enviroment and the enemies in them - which can lead to frustration, especially when you get stuck. The thick, eerie atmosphere and the incredibly effective and at times even quite beautiful super-low res visuals are worth it though, even the storyline (while not exactly fresh) is fun and interesting enough to keep you going,\n\nI would definitely recommend it to Metroid-veterans and people who are really into this genre, make sure to bring some decent skills at 2D action games/platforming or else ESA might kick your butt.","February 13","true","10.4"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","4"

In the end... I was left wishing the lore was fleshed out a little better, the game just felt like the rooms were big, the world was wide.... but small.\n\nOn metroidvanias.com, I saw a blurb for ESA and immediately bought it, and pounded through it for 40 hours to finally uncover the massive secrets within. La-mulana levels of hardcore riddles, translating an alien language by hand, all this insane post-game lore and insanity leading up to some amazing stuff. This game just felt MASSIVE, and just recently, the developer added a bunch more content for free, just a free expansion with tons of new awesome stuff that ties into everything, and it's amazing. I've got some 71 hours in at this point, and I'm pretty sure I missed some stuff.\n\nIf you like platformers, if you played axiom verge and enjoyed it, or metroid, or castlevania, you MUST purchase this game. immediately. Sell an organ if you have to, i cannot stress this enough - this game is solid gold. This game pounds everything awesome I've played since la-mulana, and probably pounds that in that it manages to perfectly present the challenges and post-game riddles in such a way that they are solvable - and never feel obtusely confusing or lost in translation to english.\n\nPurchase this game now, if you are looking at it, just do it.

I have done not much else since yesterday morning but play this game. It really is that good.\n\nI have 24 hours play time. 18 or so of those hours were a blast. At least 4 of it was being stuck in some area or another, not knowing how to proceed. And another 2 hours or so trying a boss for the 20th time. The bosses can be quite tough.\n\nAnd I'm ok with that. I like tough bosses. What I don't really care for is having to run back 2-3 screens to try again. I rage-quit more than once but kept coming back.\n\nOne particular boss appears after you activate something that causes new mobs to appear throughout the whole game. I finally beat him with 5 hp and promptly got killed on the next screen by the new mobs (that I didn't know were there now.)\n\nThis is bad. LET ME SAVE after killing a boss. Having to repeat a boss is incredibly frustrating, but I repeated it and moved on.\n\nAnd on the flip side, don't make me have to go through 3-4 screens of tricky jumps and a tough mob fight to get to a boss with no opportunity to save. This is what finally did me in on the next boss. I will not be finishing the game because I don't have the patience to keep repeating this.\n\nWith over 500 games on Steam and another 200 on my shelves dating back to the '80s, I'm not what you'd call a newb. This game kicked my ♥♥♥.\n\nBut, it was still a lot of fun while it lasted, and if you are a hardcore player or they eventually add an easy mode, it's well worth the money. Even if you don't finish it, there's a lot of fun here for $8.\n\nEdit: I couldn't let it kick my ♥♥♥. I did go back and finish it. Everything I said above still applies. The main problem is pre and post boss fights, and they should add an easy mode for more casual players.

So I was looking at the Axiom Verge reviews right when that came out and saw someone bring up this game as a better version of what Axiom Verge was trying to do. I don't know how Axiom Verge is, I still haven't played it, but I do highly doubt it'll be able to absolutely blow me away like this game did.\n\nThe controls are tight and the movement abilities are great and useful. You're given a lot of power and even still the game remains consistently challenging from beginning to end. Unless you break it with one of the last two powerups, that is.\n...though, even then the game can still find ways to challenge you.\nThe game map is pretty decently sized and very dense, making it quite fun to explore and find all the hidden nooks and crannies, secrets and powerups. There's a lot of variety too, I don't really recall any rooms that felt wasted or pointless, each brings something new to the game. The bosses, too, are pretty diverse, basically every type of boss you can imagine is here and there are no repeat bosses at all. And some of them are damn hard, the hardest parts of the game for sure.\nBut? The difficulty is always fair. Never did the game present me with a challenge that seemed completely unreasonable. Every boss can be defeated without taking a single point of damage if you learn their patterns and how to dodge their attacks while still taking them down quickly. No secret is so obscurely hidden that you wouldn't possibly be able to figure it out. It's all fair, just challenging. It makes you think outside of the box to progress or find all there is to find, but everything makes sense.\nThere's a lot of content, too. Simply playing the game to completion should run you 8-10 hours if you're exploring around and looking for secrets along the way, and completing the postgame can easily run you another 5-8 depending on how good you are at puzzle solving. And boy, the postgame puzzles. Very reminiscent of La-Mulana in the way the main game is reminiscent of Metroid, but much less cryptic without making things too obvious. I hope you were paying attention to the station's layout and rooms while playing through if you want to complete the game, though.\nI'm just. Utterly in love with this game, it's probably my favorite traditional metroidvania out of all the ones I've played.

Even so, I can easily recommend it to those players who don't mind a bit of frustration with their entertainment, particularly if they harbor any nostalgia for Metroid/Super Metroid.\n\nNota bene:  I completed the game at 100%, but cheated (increased my HP) to get the Dash Booster X and didn't really pursue any of the (seemingly) substantial post-game content.

Many people seem to compare to this Metroid but I don't feel this is very Metroid like. For me this is more closer to Jill of the Jungle and such DOS platforms. And I really prefer those DOS games.  As a developer myself I can understand the graphical style being low low res. It is so low res because then the artist doesn't have to spend as much time drawing each sprite but can still use his or her's graphical skill well and spend more time creating more varied sprites and tiles. This is good idea if you have small team and have to share multiple jobs to one person.

The game is the definition of a "metroidvania."  You are given a large, maze-like station to navigate, filled with puzzles, monsters, and bosses.  You expand your ability to reach areas by obtaining powerups, which primarily change the way you move through the game, although there are also weapon upgrades and the like.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, this game does it right.  You are given the right amount of control over your character, and the movement and abilities feel good and work the way you expect them to.  The bosses have a great variety, and each fight feels and plays out differently.  Each new boss is an interesting and satisfying new experience.  The station is very well constructed, with a pretty good mix of dungeon and maze.  The station is also solid; there are no empty rooms or spaces inside the station itself, so there is lots to explore, and tons of hidden rooms to find.\n\nGraphics and Audio really shine in this game.  The graphics are charmingly done pixels.  Most of the environments are interesting to explore, and many are downright pretty.  At many points I was struck by the direct visual influences taken from Super Metroid, and they are done wonderfully.  The soundtrack is also fantastic, giving the right mix of mystery, hostility, creepiness, and alien strangeness.\n\nThe main story premise is simple:  You are a robot sent to find out why the station went dead.  The story is advanced in small ways throughout the course of the game, given through some dialogue but mostly through computer terminals and logs.  The story is heavily one of mystery, however, so don't expect answers to all of your questions.  The game boasts multiple endings, and they are fun to unlock and see.\n\nThe game has a couple unique features to be mentioned.  First of all, once the game is completed, new objects and events appear in the station.  You are then able to undertake a new mystery (one that might take you beyond the station itself.)  This is done very well, aside from a couple frustrating moments, and it is absolutely worth completing.  Once this is done, you get an interesting little spin on the New Game + system, which you'll have to see for yourself.\n\nIt should be noted that this game is challenging.  I personally think it got the challenge level about right for most of the rooms, monsters and bosses.  However, players who are not experienced in some of the older and more challenging metroidvanias might find it a step up in difficulty from what they're used to.  Its a good kind of challenge, though, and anyone who enjoyed the original Metroids, Castlevanias, or more recent games like Cave Story should find the challenge level reasonable.  The mystery and extended end-game is tougher, but worth your time (and the forum is full of helpful posts by those who managed to puzzle most of it out first to help get you through.)\n\nThis review got long, but only because the game deserves to have its virtues extolled.  It was a pleasure to play through this game, particularly as a lover of Metroidvanias (real ones, at that.)  Its also not very expensive, which is always a plus.\n\nThis is a genuinely great metroidvania.  It might be the best Metroid since Super Metroid.  The creator has produced a love letter to the genre that firmly deserves a place in it.  Its just that good.  For the price of admission, you honestly can't go wrong.","April 28, 2015","true","42.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

It's got a great 8bit feel complemented with great boss design, Perfect controls and an amazing soundtrack. Exploration is a joy with terminals scattered around to lay out a storyline and point you in the right direction.\n\nThe main game itself will probably take you around 8 hours to complete BUT and its a massive but the amount of content to discover after you've finished the game is outstanding so many puzzles and even a new language to decode will give you hours of extra content moreso if you don't use a guide.\n\nConsidering the price and the content theres literally no reason for you not to give this game A go it's probably one of my most enjoyed game for 2015 and despite being a fan of Axiom Verge which also released around the same time and had a much bigger budget and even exposure on Playstation I actually prefer ESO and Hope Hempuli the developer continues with this level of quality for his next game!","October 27, 2015","true","25.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You play as a robot who has just discovered an abandoned station somewhere in outer space. You'll explore to unravel the mystery of the dissapearance of the station's crew, and the strange things going on in the local computer system.\n\nPros:\n- excellent movement & controls\n- unique upgrades add to interesting platforming\n- great soundtrack; atmospheric and fits the retro theme\n- optional upgrades & rewards for further exploration\n- Checkpoints/warps/shortcuts to areas keep the game interesting up until the final stages of the game so things don't get too repetitive.\n- The most hardcore challenges of the game are often optional, however, a completionist is going to have intense difficulties to overcome in the end-game.\n\nCons:\n- Some bosses are annoying if they're too challenging. The jog back to the bossroom is often short, but any time I have to face a boss more than 10 times just to get lucky can get old (I know, I know, git gud... ;)\n- No Steam achievements\n- *edit: i had a complaint about the ending, but continued playing and realized I hadn't actually finished the game :P\n\nSimilar to other classic action/puzzle games, in ESA the player finds upgrades and power-ups throughout the world (Charge Shot, Dash, Energy Upgrade, etc.) and uses these new tools to gain access to new areas. Don't think this is just a clone, however, because ESA adds a number of unique upgrades that become integral to your movement and survival throughout the game.\n\nDevelopments in the storyline will tell the player their next objective on the map, but ambitious players will be rewarded (sometimes with with killer, optional upgrades) for further exploration into the many different routes and rooms hidden throughout the world. The developer also did a great job with keeping things interesting while backtracking through previously explored areas - new enemies and traps emerge to prevent you from taking the easy path back to an objective.\n\nI don't want to spoil too much in this review, but suffice to say that when I beat the game I did not get the best ending possible. It looks like there is still A LOT for me to explore in this very involved and complicated map. It's clear to me now that the developer just might be a sadist and has likely lured many a gamer into obsession with this completionist nightmare. And yet we must be stalwart and overcome the challenges presented us.\n\nFor a game that borrows so heavily from one of the greatest and most influential series in gaming history, ESA is a shining example of a great idea made better with creative innovation.","April 1","true","27.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/StupidName/recommended/350070/","StupidName","SuperJer [Linux "Hipster"]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/StupidName/","453 products in account","It's good.  It's real good.  I am still enjoying the game thoroughly, even though I beat it hours ago.  It's one of those games that sucks you in while you're playing it, and stays on your mind when you're not.  The controls, graphics, atmosphere, and music all come together into a nice polished enjoyable experience.\n\nI'll get the flaws out of the way first.  I really only see two, and they are quite minor:\n\nPacing - If it's your second or third time through, the game probably plays fairly smoothly start to finish.  However, on the first try you will likely spend a fair bit of time searching for the next powerup, switch, or boss that advances the game.  I ended up revisiting the same dead ends a couple times, and this was occasionally frustrating.\n\n'One-way Loops' - The map is a necessity to the game.  However, often times when looking at the map it appears there may be two similar paths from your current location to the place you want to go, but only one of them is passable in the direction you are traveling.  It's sometimes very frustrating to almost get to your destination only to find out that “you can't get there from here”.  More than once the only way there is not the obvious way.\n\nThese are very minor gripes.  Minor, because of the nature of the game's strong points, like:\n\nExploration! - The game is large, and so much more full of variety than you could have possibly expected out of an 8x8 tile set and an “imaginary sound chip”.  There's so much to see and discover, and it all looks fantastic in its low-fi splendor.  Every portion of the station has it's own look and atmosphere, it's own enemies, and it's own set of unique and interesting challenges.  So when you're not sure where to go next, just go somewhere.  It's nice there.\n\nControls - The controls are tight.  They have enough predictability so that getting through a difficult area is much more a matter of practice than it is luck.  More than once I encountered a room or a boss where my first reaction was, “You've got to be kidding me, this looks impossible.”  However, after a few attempts (yes, you'll be retrying things regularly), the precision and repeatability of the controls becomes evident, and the completion of said room or boss is a very rewarding payoff.  Several times I found myself saying, “Wow!  I really pulled that off!  I'm amazing!”  Which brings me to:\n\nRewards - Accomplishing a difficult series of jumps, finding that one secret spot that looks a little different than the others, and beating that punishing boss are usually good enough rewards in and of themselves.  However, occasionally you'll find an optional powerup that is just a joy to use.  You know what I'm talking about, because you've played other Metroidvania-type games.  It's that powerup that lets you go back through other areas that were difficult the first time, and completely tear them up.  Blasting through them so much faster than before while wearing a big stupid grin and giggling a little.  Yes, this game rewards its players for a job done well.\n\nHints - Not really the obvious hints that tell you where to go next, but rather subtle hints like difficulty that say, “Maybe you should turn back.  This will be easier later.”  Usually if you encounter an area or enemy that seems unfair, it probably means you're headed in the wrong direction.  HOWEVER.  Several times throughout the game I stuck with it and muscled through an area ahead of schedule.  Not necessarily breaking the order of the game, but possibly to get a health or weapon upgrade a little early, so that I could have a little breathing room in the challenges ahead.  Very rarely was there ever an “all that work for nothing” situation.\n\nAtmosphere - The graphics, animation, and music put you there in the game.  Occasionally you'll spot inspiration from other beloved games in the genre, but it all really stands on its own, even if you're not bringing all that rosy nostalgia with you.  The water area is calming yet dangerous.  The lava area is close and oppressive.  The jungle area is verdant and lush.  At every point along the journey, the game draws you in to its amazing atmosphere.\n\nFree DLC - Yep.  The game received an update recently which included an optional new (seemingly large) area with new music, enemies, and graphics.  It's clear this developer enjoys their work.\n\nLike I said, I beat it, but I'm definitely not done with it.  I'm not a completionist by any means, but the game still has so many interesting things to do that it will be keeping me entertained for a good number of gaming sessions yet.  If you've ever enjoyed a Metroidvania game, this is definitely one to add to your library, and it seems almost criminal to be buying it for under ten bucks.\n\nP.S. My biggest request is for a Linux port.  Streaming it to a Linux machine has a number of issues that other games do not, and it has some deal-breaking control issues when played under Wine.  So if you want to play it on your Linux machine, you're fairly well out of luck unless you're better at troubleshooting strange issues than I am.  Since the game is built on MMF2, a Linux port (while not directly supported by MMF2) should be possible and mostly hassle free through a 3rd party library.  I think this developer has a bright future, and hopefully a Linux port can put a few extra dollars in their pockets, and help speed them along through their next project.","January 8","true","14.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WEWMAKER/recommended/350070/","WEWMAKER","WEWMAKER","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WEWMAKER/","9 products in account","Environmental Station Alpha is hands-down my favorite metroid-like/exploration based platfromer game ever made and just one of my favorite games in general - 3rd to be specific.\n\n\n\n\nNow that i have your attention, let's start the review.\n\n\n\nThe Story:\n\nThe story of ESA is simple, but effective. I revolves around the titular Environmental Station Alpha and the mysterious events that caused it to be abandoned many years ago. You, a robot of one of the many other stations, are tasked to find out what happened here. As you progress you'll find bits and pieces of the incredibly depressing, detailed and devastating story behind the station's destruction. Most of the story is told through these optional world- and story-building tools called diskette readers, which are found all over the station and consist mostly of the desperate and confused ramblings of trapped researchers who are on the verge of death. The story- and world building in this game is even better done than in Metroid Prime, as the story is seemingly told OUT OF ORDER, which means you have to piece the puzzle together, and if you decide to complete this game, it will be one  hell  of a puzzle. Another way this improves on the Prime formula is by having them also subtly tell you where to go next to progress the story, whereas in Prime it's conveyed through text prompts that pop up randomly on your visor. the difference is in ESA it's optional and more sublte.\n\n\nThe Setting:\n\nThe setting in this game is without a doubt my favorite setting in video game history. It does just about everything right. The Environmental Station Alpha is as previously explained, an abandoned space station revolving around artificially created biomes where expirements were held. This premise already guarantess immense variety, and Esα delivers on that promise. The station is a blend of industrial and organic, which makes it more fun to explore. But that's not a new idea, what is new is the way the narrative plays with the setting and vice-versa. Think of the Esα as the B.S.S. research station from Metroid Fusion if it was abandoned after it had been destroyed for years instead of just a short period of time. You are exploring the aftermath of 3 disasters that striked at once. The cave complexes have collapsed, the jungle has overgrown and the ocean sector has collpased into multiple areas of the station, flooding into the other sectors. There are 3 areas that are even more notable, but you'll have to see for yourself. It's hard to describe what makes the world of Esα so immersive, but the music definitely plays a part. The soundtrack is has some of the best ambient pieces i've ever heard. I've never felt this lonely yet this mesmerized and eager to explore an area in a video game. There is so much to say about the setting i could fill 10 reviews with it, but i'll let you see. The graphics, the colors, the narrative, the music, the gameplay, the sound design, it ALL feeds into the setting perfectly and vice-versa.\n\nThe Gameplay:\n\nEsα introduces a few new elements that improve on the 2d metroid formula while simplifying it a bit too. The first notable difference: you DON'T HAVE A PROJECTILE, and never obtain one too. This is HUGE. This means that the combat is handled diffrently, and in my opinion, handled better. You have to approach and take advantage of your movement options a lot more which makes for a more dynamic game. There are upgrades, some optional and some mandatory that make it easier. In terms of movement, you get 2 airdashes - 1 horizontal and 1 vertical - that you can use once in the air unless you obtain a hard to find end-game item that allows you to dash infinitely. An then you have the hookshot, which is the grappling beam from super metroid except more fluid, more dynamic and can grapply to 99% of the ceiling in the game. But the biggest change in movement is weirdly enough the height of the character? The robot you play as is proportional to every block in the game, so say goodbye to the slightly clunky morph-ball mechanic and say hello to seamless exploration. All of these movement options and the way the combat is handled make the already great bosses even more fun to fight. The way the power-ups are distribued is also genius. Instead of handing out powerups like fast food companies hand out diabetes this game only has 14 power-ups, 4 of which are optional. This means that every time you upgrade your character it feels like a geniune accomplishment instead of a small bonus. One last thing to add is the amount of health. Your health caps out at 30, meaning no metroid 1600-health-that-depletes-surprisingly-fast ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and more perfect difficulty. It's Super Metroid without any of the bad stuff. (btw if anyone thinks i hate the 2d Metroids i don't, i just think they have flaws that Esα improves on)\n\n\nThe Rest:\n\nThere is so much more to talk about, the insane post-game, I could go wayyyy more in-depth about the story, setting and gameplay, but i'd rather you find out yourself. Hell, I haven't even done everything in this game! I haven't even beaten the best boss in the game! Another note is: if you don't have the correct graphic card or an average PC not suited for gaming like me, expect this game to be buggy. But even with that, I had one of the best experiences i've ever had in my life playing this game. A character-limited review system like steam's can not do this masterpiece justice.\n\n\n\nI'm feeling a strong to STRONGER 10 on this game.","April 17","true","38.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

First thing's first, if you're a fan of unfair games, this is the sort of game you might want to pick up. That's not to say it's unbeatable, just have fun re-loading because you took one hit in the gauntlet before the boss chamber.\n\nPros: Graphics, sound, and gameplay are all good. The graphics are low-bit, but done in a style that works. Music is just phenomenal. The gameplay is pretty fluid and easy to get the hang of. The atmosphere is done absolutely wonderfully.\n\nCons: There really aren't any outside of my personal gripes, to follow. It runs smoothly and if the extreme unfairness is your cup of tea, then all the power to you.\n\nGripes: The game is unfair and difficult. The hard spots are hard enough, but you find yourself taking a lot of cheap shots in a lot of places. Unfortunately, taking a hit or two on the way to a boss means you either have to have the boss down pat and not be off by a microsecond with any of your moves, or just re-load. Health is far too scarce for it's own good, and when you do happen across an upgrade, it's usually completely inacessable until much later in the game. There are exceptions of course, though the game pretty much just taunts you with health that you desperately need, especially on later bosses. There are no health pickups whatsoever, and what little they did to assuage that quickly becomes inadequate. You need to just get used to the controls and avoid taking hits rather than actually staying and fighting. Especially when everything you encounter starts to hit you for more than one point of damage, because even at max, normal mode's HP cap is 30. You wind up being incredibly flimsy. Oddly, I found the difficulty varies rather harshly from one boss to the next, one boss will beat you over and over and the next one you'll beat on your first or second try.\n\nAt the end of the day, I have to say that these games are the most fun when your effort is actually rewarded, and your efforts are usually rewarded with obstacles you can't pass.... yet. Kinda takes the wind out of exploration. I found myself tentative about even exploring, since if it wasn't the right way to go, there would be no payoff. And that's just no fun. And now to actually beat this game...","February 13","true","7.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

Every boss has a unique attack pattern and usually some hidden weak point. Power ups can be used in lots of different ways, with some functions not obvious at first.

The Bosses are rather difficult at first but have a clear pattern to them and require your upgrades you find through out the game. The environments are well designed but a little cliche but excused since they are nice to look at and have great music to go with. Speaking of music, its kinda like 16 bit music but it sounds a lot better. Only complaint about the music is the fact that there isn't a download for the sound track.

My main complaints here are that several hidden things (including some exceedingly useful upgrades) are hidden in a completely unclued manner, or put in places that communicate to the player "come back later" rather than "keep trying", and that the ending you get for finding what the game considers 100% is thoroughly unsatisfying and predictable.\n\nThe second game is for people who thought Fez wasn't cryptic enough, and also needed some combat and cheap insta-death precision platforming. It basically just feels like a long drag of purposeless padding, along with a section that asks the player to go through a ridiculously, unnecessarily cheap section two or three different times. Basically you have to do a bunch of random-seeming running around through sections of the game you've been to already, followed by going to a cryptic secret section, followed by a dumb maze, followed by more running around including said cheap section again and the maze again and possibly twice, and when you're all done running around you have to start mostly over again in a new game+ and beat the whole thing all over again, and just...ugh.\n\nWorse still, most of the instructions on what the game wants you to do in this part are locked behind a weird alien language that I honestly have no idea how anyone ever translated, as the only way I was able to know what any of it was saying was by reading a walkthrough. I mean, even Fez had a "Quick brown fox" room. And no, I don't think that discovering any of this latter part of the game myself would have been any more fun, because it probably never would have happened. There's a decent boss fight or two buried in this section, but it's mostly just not worth it. As of this writing I've basically lost my enthusiasm for playing the game thanks to this part, especially since the only endings that aren't the two that suck from the aforementioned first game require completing pretty much the entirety of this part.\n\nSo..I have to recommend this game entirely on the gameplay of the first part. And the fact that I'm willing to do so should tell you just how solid that gameplay is.","February 11","true","14.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'd give it  7/10. I was much more excited about it from watching the trailers than I have been playing the game. I've progressed quite a ways(about 3/4ths of the way through) and here are the pros and cons.\n\nPros:\nInteresting enemy types\nVery challenging\nThe boss fights are really hard and fun\nThe environments look good\n\nCons:\nThere are quite a few problems.\nThe bosses rearely give you a sense of achievement. Yeah, you won, but some of them give you nothing for beating them which can be pretty diasppointing after a hard fought battle( where you die 20 times).\n\nThe powerups are pretty lame. I feel so underpowered in battle it's sad. I mean just think about playing super metroid with nothing but the charge shot most of the game...kinda lame right?\n\nThe music is good in some areas( water level, title theme) but in others it is just bad or really poorly chosen i.e. it does not fit the context of the gameplay at all and only serves to create this asymmtery in the mood( like the temple music).\n\nIt can be a really frustrating experience due to a combination of no health drops from enemies, spread out save points(which you are teleported back to when you die and lose all progress since you last saved) and difficult and sometimes obtuse platforming sections( The sand section just sucks, it really does).\n\nMy least favorite aspect is the backtracking which is really the meat of the game(this is what takes the most time in a playthrough). For example, I beat a boss and got a new marker but there was literally no way to get to it UNLESS I somehow knew of this one little room far away from it that housed a secret powerup. I only figued it out by reading online. I couldn't progress in the game until I figured this out; this got really annoying.\n\n\n\nOVerall: I do reccommend it. There's not much like it and it has great charm, a ton of gameplay, a fun challenge, and some really cool little details that show alot of care by the developers.","February 9","true","15.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Many reviews both positive and negative will touch on the difficulty of the bosses, but each of them behave consistently enough that victory is not a matter of luck, but figuring out the correct counter-strategy and perfecting its execution. Enduring defeat long enough to establish this muscle memory admittedly requires equal parts humility and stubbornness.

The endgame is IMO where the love of the game shines, with cryptic puzzles that require some real work to solve, but creates a much greater feeling of a real world. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys metroidvanias, but everyone should be aware of the real difficulty of the endgame puzzles, they can be very vague, reminding me strongly of later puzzles in La-Mulana.

They all come to mind when diving into this simple yet great platformer. Its not your fancy colorful artsy game you see out on the market now a days but this package will trigger your childhood memories of playing 1 of the most influential game ever made. Its your standard Metriod platform with only your blaster to start off with and a space station to explore. Im not going to get into the details about a metriod game because chances are if you interested enough to read these reviews you already know the formula for this kind of game. Yes the bosses are tough and big but not without their weakness. They will frustrate you as they get increasingly harder and it will take a couple of tries to figure out their attack pattern but hitting that last chunk of health sure feels satisfying as you watch it explode. The station is surprisingly big with tons of secrets that gracefully won't seem obvious and make you explore every nook and cranny if stumped and not sure what to do next. It may get tedious depending on how good your luck is in figuring it out but for the most part it just takes a little extra time looking for a masked block or a hidden path you just so happen to walk into. The art design of the game really puts those who like exploring weird or out of place objects revealing something useful feel at home. With that in mind the gameplay mechanics is where it gets juicy. The mobility and shooting of the hero is solid. Jumping is swift and consistent but shooting and hookshoting may take a little getting used to. Especially since the your blaster doesn't have much range for merely the entirety of the game and your hookshot(once obtained) can stick to almost any surface but swinging will need to be practiced. As you progress, each powerup fall in place and provides its usefulness. nothing revolutionary but none the less gratifying when obtained. Old school never gets old especially when enhanced with cleaner gameplay mechanics and puzzles to solve. The only downer of the game is the map. Although VERY useful (because you'll get lost often) but not very detailed. Good enough to see which direction to go but Dots and Color can only inform so much when you don't remember what the room looks like. other than that its a great Metriod replica and vast amounts of hidden secrets to uncover. So If you want a solid NES style adventure and the Metriod aesthetic environment, then the $7.99USD is a steal","May 19, 2015","true","51.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are plenty of species you face inhabiting the biomes. Platforming while defending yourself can prove quite the challenge with only 4 directions to fire a short-ranged weapon.\n\nArt & SoundtrackEnvironmental Station Alpha executes the retro feel excellently. The game features a darker, more neutral palette that references the original Metroid and Super Metroid. The soundtrack is along the same vein while remaining unique.\n\nGetting LostBe prepared to get lost. There are times when your next objective is obvious, as certain events update your map with markers, but other times when they don’t. You'll often find yourself seeing places you can go, yet don't have the means to get there. There are walls you can move through to new rooms that have no visual indication, contrary to other areas that may have cracks or color variation where blocks can be broken or passed through. It becomes irritating when progression is based on luck, shooting and jumping into random walls all the time, just so you don't miss something.\n\nExplorationAs is the nature of exploration, you'll be doing some backtracking. But know that areas aren't always as they were the first time, be it new enemies, closed off routes from overgrowth, and activated security systems adding challenges to your original paths. In addition, there are teleporters to get around the station quickly, which makes the exploring less redundant.\n\nWritingThere are a few moments when the script makes the dialogue and message logs feel like a poor fan-fiction. It can remove the player from the immersion at times, but mostly, it's solid and believable. The story is driven primarily by these logs, so be prepared to read.\n\nBoss DesignBoss battles are great. Each is a unique experience in varying difficulty and techniques required to beat them. There are a number of optional and secret bosses that test your understanding of the physics of the game.\n\nDepthThe game goes surprisingly deep with optional power ups, secret areas, an alien language, hidden rooms, easter eggs, and tons of post-game content, all of which the game doesn't spoil for the curious explorer. The game has even seen the addition of a new area since its initial release.\n\nSummaryIf you enjoy the Metroid franchise, you'll likely enjoy Environmental Station Alpha. It's undeniably influenced by that series, but most certainly no carbon copy. This is no cheap-but-short indie game. It is similar in length to Metroid, and even deeper with its secrets. If you think you'll have Samus Aran's familiar arm cannon and powerups, then you're in for a pleasant surprise.","January 25","true","27.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ghostlypixel/recommended/350070/","ghostlypixel","GhostlyPixel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ghostlypixel/","178 products in account","(This review may contain minor spoilers, warnings are written before passages that may spoil the story, mechanics, boss fights, progression, or other gameplay elements)\n\nAs of writing this review I have less than an hour of play time, but I am already in love with this game. I will come through and edit this review as needed when I finish the game, but off the bat there were so many good things that I liked.\n\nEnvironmental Station Alpha was introduced to me through a Metroid community, by someone who claimed that it had a very much Metroid feel to it. It becomes very aparent that this is incredibly true. The isolation and exploration are two huge giveaways, and the boss fights just add to it. As a massive Metroid fan, and someone who plays games that try to replicate the Metroid-feel, I can say for sure that this is one of the games that manages to pull it off exceptionally well.\n\nESA, at least the very very early game (Pre-second boss) is a lot like the classic Metroid in that it is very unforgiving. Health is pretty sparce (as far as I know, only save stations replenish), which made each encouter much more tense because I could only afford a few hits before I was killed.\n\nThe game tells a lot through the use of color, but some parts are missing a bit of color. I found myself constantly falling in the green water (acid?) and not realizing it until my character exploded. The acid is only showing as a collection of green pixel waves at the top of the liquid. I think possibly filling in the pools with even a light, almost completely transparent green, would make them a bit more visable to the player. So far I've seen a lot of use of cool colors for the backgrounds. Dark blues, greys, purples, and blacks dominate the colors, with a bit of red accents. Most interactable machines are easy to pick out because they generally use brighter cool colors, and machines such as the save station feature a lot of contrasting red to really pop out. Walking in to an environment with a new color palette than before really adds to that exploration factor because you feel like you're finding new things, new places.\n\nThe bosses are the right amount of hard from what I found. Without doing any sort of walkthrough I could easily see myself taking no more than two tries on the bosses that I faced. You just need to take time to learn their patterns and find a way to hit them without hurting yourself.\n\nWhen I first saw the store page for this game, I noticed multiple developer announcements, many regarding patches. So I came in expecting a bit of a buggy game, but not in a bad way because it seems the developers are hard at work fixing everything they can. Great job guys. I personally only had issues with enemies being stuck in vertical 'doorways' to another level, which really just made them an easy target, and I also had some framerate issues (Intel i5 4200H, GTX 860m) occasionally, but both issues were nothing to really get upset about. I should also add that my Xbox 360 controller didn't seem to be picked up by the game, launched through Big Picture and regular mode, nothing on either. It was set to controller mode in the settings, on Windows, but again, nothing to really fuss about.\n\nI'm excited to spend a day going through this game and seeing what it has to offer, and I hope that others take the time to enjoy the mood and atmosphere that the game has to offer. As I said before, I will edit this review as needed when I complete the game.\n\nUPDATE 1 (Minor boss fight spoilers, although no specific bosses mentioned, just mechanics): I still have yet to complete the game currently I have just unlocked the teleporters. The bosses get very tough, very fast. The boss fights are all about learning the boss' paterns, but some bosses require attacking parts of the environment and even their own projectiles to defeat them, but the game does nothing really to help the player (generally environmental things turned on if they were computers, but it wasn't something pointed out). Now you could attribute this to the game's exploration factor, where you keep trying until you find the right way, but it does get a bit frustrating after a while. I have already found myself playing just until I beat the next boss, then stopping to cool down for a while, but the "just one more boss..." mentality does start to set in.\n\nI can't help but feel that I have completely missed some crucial health tanks though, because I have fought three or four bosses now, but have only found one health upgrade, which increased my health by a measly (yet suprisingly life-saving) four points. I cannot tell if I am completely missing them, or if the game just doesn't have very many very often, but it's been interesting fighting bosses who take almost a quarter of my health with every hit.\n\nMy review still stands though. If you enjoyed Metroid and Metroid-style games, if you enjoy exploring a world and learning through the environment, then you will enjoy ESA.\n\nI should also add that for my entire time spent in-game, controller input doesn't seem to be recognized. I use a USB wireless Xbox 360 controller reciever. I'd love to try the game out with a controller, but I am unable to.\n\nUPDATE 2: (A boss fight spoiler, and story spoiler in the last sentence, you have been warned)\nThe Serpent fight really needs to be looked at. It is incredibly inconsistant and has become quite a frustrating fight. I discovered that I missed at least one health upgrade back in the hookshot area, so fighting the boss with only 14 health is pretty rediculous, especially when I believe that I would have defeated the boss if I had had the extra four units of health. So why don't I just go back and get it? I can't. The charge shot room has all exits that don't lead to the boss completely blocked by currents. I am stuck fighting a boss that I cannot beat with the amount of health I have.\n\nThe fight has some pretty rediculous parts. The hitbox of the wave attack is very misleading near the back, and I seemed to notice that I took damage even after I was one block from the back of the wave, but this damage only happened sometimes, making it pretty hard to judge when it would and wouldn't happen. In some fights the serpent very nicely hops out of the water sprays a rediculous amount of shots, and then drops back into the water. Other fights the boss hits me once so that I take no damage temporarily, moves into the center of my character, and begins very quickly spinning, damaging me until I die. This is completely unavoidable, and seems to happen about sixty percent of the time. In a game where you learn to beat the bosses by learning their attacks and patterns through constant fight attempts, this sort of inconsistancy just doesn't belong and only ends with a frustrated player.\n\nThe boss also has multiple phases. I'm all for bosses with phases, but, as the writer of 'Wot I Think' said in his ESA review, having no way to regenerate your health mid-fight makes the game much more frustrating. ESA could really benefit from small health packs that maybe restore two or four points of health, instead of relying on save stations and health stations (which there are very few of in the water area). I hate having to run back through my last five to ten minutes of progress just to recharge at a save station.\n\nRight now I'm in a bit of a love/hate relationship with this game. I love Metroid, and this game reminds me so much of it. But the constant frustration from so many factors (the biggest being a constant feeling that I'm going the wrong way) limits me to around half-hour sessions that generally end with me angrilly mashing alt-f4 on the "Continue?" screen. I want to play this game, I really do, but I can't help but think about how frustrated I will be very soon.\n\nThe difficulty and frustration now makes me fear the sudden difficulty spike that so many players have ranted about once the AI is reactivated.","April 27, 2015","true","5.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

One can imagine, with the passage of time, these game genres have evolved.  To me, Environmental Station Alpha is just that.\nEnvironmental Station Alpha lives much in the spirit of Super Metroid, with a dash of Bionic Commando.  Traveling through the decrepit station is a mostly enjoyable experience, with the occasional difficulty spike.  There's a fair amount of content here, or at least there was for myself and my subpar platforming skills.  My final file complete time was around 10 hours, but due to bad process management and numerous deaths/reset, I likely completed the game in around 20.  That is all the content of the game, including the fairly meaty end-game, which proves a real challenge in both skill and, to a lesser degree, intellect.   One of the devs has been very active in the Steam forum, and has released several patches based directly off of feedback.\nUltimately, if you're looking for a decent, challenging metroidvania, I would recommend this game.  Some of the mechanics take some practice, and some of the bosses require a bit of trial-and-error, but the overall package feels polished, and the minimalist pixel-art remains consistently eye-catching.  If you're on the fence there's a demo, which does feature one of the more skill-based mechanics.","April 30, 2015","true","26.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's a Metroid-inspired platformer with retro graphics, so from premise alone it doesn't really have that "wow" factor that really compels me to play some games. After having played through it, I'll say that it wasn't the most inspired of games out there, but what it did, it did pretty well.\n\nOf course, one of the most important parts of any Metroid-derivative game is the sense of exploration. At first, I was worried that the world seemed really small, given that the map at the time didn't seem exactly large. However, there's a lot within this map, and even by screen count alone, there's over 800 screens in the game. Even though it is a pretty big map, the map is very dense; there's a lot to do in this world, and even though it did get tiresome having to backtrack all the time when exploring the western side of the map, at least the rest of the map is very easy to explore. After a while in game you also unlock teleporters, which as mentioned in the previous sentence are pretty evenly placed with the exception of the desert and water areas.\n\nAnother big part of any Metroid style game is to have really cool powerups. I found 14 throughout my playthrough (although I've heard rumors of a soopur sekrit 15th), and while a few were either completely unnecessary (the rough map, for example really shouldn't be a powerup) or just served as an arbitrary gating mechanism (the keycard that unlocks golden blocks), there are a lot of really fun powerups as well. You've got standard things for a Metroid-esque game like the Heat-Resistant Suit and the Charge Beam, but there's also powerups that let you dash around all over the place, as well as a grapple hook which is easily the most fun powerup in the game.\n\nThis game also has bosses, and these sure are some bosses. While some of these bosses could do with either not having as many phases or having one health bar so that you know how many phases the boss has, almost all of these bosses are very fun to fight. There's only two bosses in the game that I would consider bad, and those are one boss where the only way you can damage the boss is to kite its projectiles back at the boss (a lot less fun than it sounds TBH) and a boss where it's impossible to defeat it without a certain powerup and stupidly easy to defeat with the powerup. However, for these missteps there are more than a few bosses which definitely make up for it.\n\nFinishing the game for the first time took me about seven hours, but that's far from when the game is over. You can either choose to leave the game there or go on and play the post-game which can easily take you as long to beat as the main game does. While the mystery of unlocking pillars which are hitherto unknown to you is very cool, after a while the postgame turns into an insane amount of tedious backtracking and puzzles which are almost certainly way too obscure for their own good. I've played La-Mulana; I'm used to obscure puzzles, and while the now infamous Clock puzzle is cleverly structured, actually executing what has to be done to finish the puzzle just isn't worth it to me. As such, that's where I stopped playing.\n\nEven though the post-game does get incredibly long-winded after a while, the main game is still a whole lot of fun, but one thing that concerns me is that, much like La-Mulana, all the magic is gone after the first playthrough once you know how to do everything and where to go. While the bosses are a load of fun, that's really all any subsequent playthroughs of this game are gonna be about. While unfortunately this game may be a "one-and-done" for me, at least it was a pretty solid one-and-done. 8/10.\n\nStory: While I never got the third ending for completing the post-game (yes, this game has multiple endings), I did quite enjoy the writing of this game. It's written in a very sparse way, with some humor from time to time, but mostly detailing the crew attempting to survive from whatever the hell happened here on the station. While it does get a little overdone with its 2spooky-ness from time to time, it's still pretty well presented, and it leaves just enough for you to start filling in the gaps yourself. Not bad. 7/10.\n\nGraphics: Well, you can tell from the store screenshots that this game is an 8-Bit pixel style game, and while that's far from anything terribly original, much like the gameplay it is at least done pretty well. The spriters made good use of their palette and screen royalty to give you some pretty damn awesome looking areas and enemies. Also, given that this game makes use of pixel art, you wouldn't expect any lag. Thankfully, I never had any lag throughout the entirety of the game. Resolution is a bit of a tricky spot, though; the game fullscreens by default, but renders as a square, leaving some pretty unsightly black bars on the sides. While this is something of a nitpick, I kinda wish they had done something like what La-Mulana did and have some graphics to the sides to at least make the screen feel a bit more full. Still though, the area, monster and boss designs are more than enough to hold your attention. Great job for the visual artists here. 5/5.\n\nSound: This game does have a tendency to feel a bit confused as far as the sound direction goes. Even though the game was "8-Bit," the OST feels like it would be more at home on an SNES. The sound effects feel pretty out of place from time to time as well; some of the sounds are realistic and some of the sounds are chippy. Even though this is pretty weird given the game's staunch insistence on looking like Metroid, at least the OST gets one thing right: ambience. While a couple of the songs get tired due to having to backtrack through a couple of areas (*cough* desert and water areas *cough*), each of the songs make the area feel like its own. It may not be the catchiest of OSTs, but it does its job well for providing atmosphere. Again, while the sound direction does kinda clash against the graphical direction from time to time, at least it works. 4/5.\n\nOverall scores are: 8/7/5/4; cumulative score of 8.0/10. I'd definitely say there's enough to this game to easily warrant a full price purchase irrespective of supporting indie devs; there's just a lot of meat to this game. You may feel like throwing up after eating all that meat, but at least it was good before you threw it all up.","May 2, 2015","true","12.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

In many ways, the game does retain a distinct Metroid feel throughout, but unfortunately it falls off where those didn't with a very limited arsenal, infrequent pickups, and combat that starts to feel like a chore after a while. Traversing the station was a lot of fun, and I liked the segments where I had to explore far more than any time the game tested my combat ability, which, because of a lack of any long beam, felt like a repetitive slog through boss mechanics.\n\nThe graphics leave something wanting as well, as the environments feel sparse and retro, which works very well, but anything which animates is far too simplistic, and I found it straining to look at after a while, especially the player sprite.\n\nA worthy sendoff to Samus this is not, but there is some fun to be had as it isn't a shallow parody of a Metroid game, merely an underdeveloped love-letter to one. I recommend only for those truly hungry for an isolating exploration platformer.","March 24","false","7.9"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

Toward the endgame it starts becoming so unforgiving that you need pixel precision to make jumps, grapples, and perfect timing just to destroy non boss enemies on your way to the final boss.\n\nThe game became basically unplayable after I beat the security overmind. Short of backtracking through the insanely hard platforming segments just to find a disk or computer to read, there is literally nothing left for me to explore.\n\nDon't buy this unless you actually enjoy impossible challenges like I wanna be the guy.

Each was unique and challenging.\n\nThe game has been a great experience so far and shows no signs of slowing down.\n\nThe main downside that I see is in the text. The screens that give you objectives have very sparse plot. They pretty much just tell you were to go, end of story.

I quit at the part where some enemies were following you on the Y axis in the Volcano area, next to a room with fireball spitting Piranha plants.\n\n=============\n\nIts good aspects:\n- It is aesthetically a nice game, very loyal to the 8-bit graphics I liked with NES games.\n- It has a nice soundtrack and atmosphere, it really felt like a Metroid inspired game.\n- The boss battles I did were fun, you may need to learn a pattern, but they were fun to play.\n\n=============\n\nBut, its bad aspects:\n\n- It is a difficult game, you dont have a lot of health. The enemies and the environment tend to do a lot of damage later in the game. You can crank up your HP by editing the game's config, but I think the ingame upgrades should do this.\n\n- It is a cryptic game, I often did not know what I had to do in order to progress. At first the game helps out with messages on ingame computers, but later on I often had the feeling I was missing certain items in order to progress like a vertical boost jump. I spent a lot of time looking for a fourth energy source in the Temple area, it turned out you had to move through a wall to get to it. I had to look on a YouTube video to figure this one out, that area just looks too much like a plain wall. In Metroid, a Zoomer (enemy) would have crawled along the wall and disappeared inside the hidden part to give a hint. If it were for a secret item like the disks, it would be fine. But not in order to progress in the storyline.\n\n- It is a hard platformer, where you really need to master the hookshot jumps to get where you need to go. Too often I get knocked off by Rinka enemies, falling stalagtites or projectiles and drop into acid or lava. It just becomes annoying after too many times. However, some people may think this is where the challenge of the game is and consider it a good point.\n\n- It is not very rewarding, I think it would have been better if boss battles rewarded you with upgrades rather than having to search for them. Also the heat suit kind of disappointed me, I need it just to get through a few areas. The Metroid Varia suit, deducts damage done from enemies and allows you to walk in lava. Also, killing enemies become a bit of a chore, they do not drop anything usefull like health.\n\n=============\n\nBecause of these points I do not recommend this game to other players. Im just a casual gamer however and people with more skill and patience probably will find this game enjoyable.\nI really wanted to like this game inspired by Metroid, but it just became too difficult and cryptic  for me to keep up with it.","July 19, 2015","false","9.2"," 8 of 20 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","8","20","0","0"

Main game has its up points (good boss design, varied environments, fun powerups, excellent music), but also suffers from poor overall map design from a game-progression standpoint.  Typically, a well crafted, exploration-based, Metroidvania-style game will follow a logical, carefully-planned sequence--the game won't explicitly tell you where to go, but is designed to lead you to the path to progress.  This is not the case in ESA, where I often had to wonder around aimlessly (for long periods of time) to figure out where I was supposed to go next, or how to get the powerup that I could see but could not otherwise reach.\n\nMap design aside, unless played on easy, the typical player will be unlikely to complete the normal game storyline due to the high (sometimes extreme) difficulty.  The main game storyline is a disappointment and all the possible endings are very unsatisfying -- I won't provide specific details as to avoid spoilers (though you would not be missing much, anyway).  Post-game content is so cryptic and tedious that I doubt anyone, save for a very, very small percentage of players would derive any enjoyment from it--I certainly didn't, even though I took the time to complete it, in the hopes that it would lead to something interesting in terms of storyline.\n\nOverall, I think the game was a good effort towards its intended role of providing a nostalgic look at the classic, Metroid-style gameplay.  Unfortunately, the frustrations described above ruined the experience for me.  Would not recommend picking it up as I feel the experience was not worth the time I invested in playing it.","December 31, 2015","false","15.6"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

It's so hard you spend a lot of the game feeling like you are sequence breaking.\n\n-Your weapon has a range of about two arms lengths\n-No diagonal firing so it can be awkwardly challenging hitting enemies\n-Enemies tend to circle you, do a lot of damage, move very fast and come out of nowhere (remember you can only fire about two blocks in front of you)\n-Forced exploration where you try to recollect where all of THOSE COLOURED BLOCKS you can now destroy were. Which leads to a hell of a lot of dead ends "hey i can get through here now.. into a dead end"\n-Bosses are just insane, you can try like 5 times to kill a boss only to finally get there to find that was only phase one of three\n-Weapon upgrades, in three hours I have found just a charge shot, and it just keeps getting harder with some enemies jumping around all over the place taking about six charged shots to kill\n-Platforming, frustrating as hell, I was stuck on one segment for about 15 minutes solid. If I hadn't already explored literally everywhere else I would have though (not for the first time) that I was sequence breaking and meant to go elsewhere. I swear some of the jumps and hookshot moves require literal pixel perfection.\n-No health pickups from killing enemies, so even the most basic ones that are just a pain in the balls to hit will just slowly grind you down in between save stations.\n\nAfter multiple occasions where I had to use cheatengine to slow the game down to 50% on some bosses and platforming sections, I got to one boss, died three times, realised I didn't have a hope in hell and just quit. Which sucks to be honest as the story is genuinely quite compelling and I wanted to continue and find all the upgrades. Although that story.. "go here, might be researchers that survived, OH NO JUST KIDDING GIANT MECHA-SNAKE".. doesn't always make sense\n\nThere were a lot of times when the game was fun sure, but it mostly made me want to stab somebody in the throat. The story is good, and it has it's moments, but I have personally given up and am instead choosing to watch some other mug that is much better than me die over and over and over again on youtube whilst I watch, eat all the nearby food and laugh at their pain. At least I know they eventually do it.\n\nA lot of potential, interesting story, could be fun but is instead ridiculously difficult not only in terms of the limited health and hard as balls bosses, but the pixel perfect platforming too. Feels like the execution let it down. But I'll still be watching this other muppet finish the story so I know what happens, although he seems to spend a lot of time just sitting there with the map open. Probably whilst he's off throat-stabbing.","May 3, 2015","false","8.4"," 7 of 27 people (26%) found this review helpful","26","7","27","0","0"

Much of the game feels like Metroid. It's atmospheric and doesn't give much in the way of guidance. Exploration is key here. There are plenty of options for exploring without being overwhelming. Even when I felt like I had no idea where to go, it didn't take long to get back on track. The world's reasonably large and varied. Upgrades are interesting and fun, even if some are tricky to use effectively a first.\n\nThe combat in this game is difficult. The gun has a pretty short range and it doesn't get a whole lot better with upgrades. This isn't generally a problem while exploring, but bosses get to be very difficult. Later bosses can be tricky to damage and have attacks that are hard to avoid. I played on normal, but there is an easy mode if the difficulty is too high.\n\nFor how long the game is... it depends. The first/main ending was 7-8 hours. There's a lot of optional stuff - upgrades, bosses, collectables. There's also a 'postgame' that leads to a few more endings. There are a lot of vague hints / riddles about where to go and what to do. It's sort of similar to Fez or La-Mulana, but generally less obtuse than either of those. Finishing the postgame could take as long as the main game, but depends on how fast you solve things.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend if you want a pretty good Metroid style game. There's a lot to do and it's all nicely designed. It can be a bit too hard at times.","July 6, 2015","true","22.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

ESA, like Axiom Verge, sometimes gets a bit too close when it comes to lifting graphical assets and enemy movement patterns from Metroid to not annoy me (if I wanted to play Metroid or Super Metroid I will play the originals).\nESA does, however, offer a good experience at a good price. Although not graphically intricate or inspired, the game does look nice from a pixel art perspective. Like mentioned, I do feel the hints to Metroid when it comes to some of the tiles and enemies are a bit too much.\nThe game has quite a bit of backtracking and a surprisingly large map. Music is a delight. Sounds are nothing spectacular, but don't detract from the overall experience.\nBoss battles are my primary gripe with this game. Although not very inspired, they do offer more than decent challenge, which I enjoy. It does annoy me to no end, though, when the HP bar is almost empty only to suddenly refill and the boss enters another state. I can live with this as a chocking WTF-kind-of-thing once, but it happens often and occasionally even twice with the same boss.\nThe backtracking also becomes quite tedious towards the later part of the game when suddenly the station is powered up and you get shot at from all kinds of thingymajigs.\n\nPros:\nMusic\nArt style\nThe challenge\n\nNeutral:\nSounds\n\nCons:\nAnnoying HP refills on many of the bosses\nBacktracking gets tedious towards the second half of the game\nWouldn't mind if the developers had ventured further from the Metroid graphical concept","January 6","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Go find out why."\n\nThat's about all you need, and all you get, to start exploring Environmental Station Alpha. Despite its simplistic appearance, there is a lot of atmosphere and mystery surrounding the space station. As you explore, you find upgrades that let you explore more, and you eventually discover what went wrong. So now you know what you need to do to save the day.\n\nBut ESA doesn't just ask you to find out "what" went wrong. It also poses the questions "Why?" and "How?", and therein lies the trap.\n\nMy first run through the game clocked in at 5 hours. Literally, exactly 5 hours. 5:00:00, on the dot. Navigating certain areas, and figuring out where to go, is generally obvious enough thanks to mission objectives being marked on the map but there are moments in the game where you're just left wondering where you're supposed to apply the new upgrade you just got. There could be 20 unexplored rooms, but only 1 of them is where you need to go next. Repeat this for each upgrade and it quickly becomes tiresome. Bring a notepad; ESA doesn't have any sort of "Map markup" feature that lets you leave notes on your map, but it does explicitly state which tile on the map grid you're on at any given time, and maybe just writing down "red blocks at 18-12" would be enough.\n\nThat isn't my biggest gripe with the game, though. As I said, I got through the main story in 5 hours, which I'm assuming isn't too bad for a first-time without the use of any guides. However, the ending leaves you feeling unsatisfied, as if there was another approach you could have taken for a more satisfying resolution.\n\nWell, there is. This game is absolutely loaded with secrets. I don't mean cute hidden upgrades (though there's a couple of those), I mean new areas, new bosses, new endings, the whole shebang. And it is absolutely esoteric. Is it worth it? Honestly, I want to say no. The post-game content is great (exploring the new areas, fighting the new bosses) but it's so bogged down with pointlessly esoteric nonsense and repetitive filler tasks that the effort involved to get there is far greater than the payoff. The two fights with You-Know-Who were a blast, but it took me close to 8 hours of faffing about in order to unlock what I understand is the True Actual Final Boss.\n\nI like that the game offers a rather deep rabbit hole to go down if you're willing, but because of all the dead-ends, invisible walls, and one-way doors, it's too much of a chore to fully complete. As much fun as I had fighting the post-game bosses, I can't say that all of the filler content in between them was worth the time and effort. The base game, however, remains a solid experience, and I can recommend the game on that point alone.","April 15","true","15.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Gobs of areas to find your way through that are packed with small details, secrets upon secrets around every corner that will have you using a notebook to keep track, multiple endings, and so much more all on top of crisp controls and a fantastic set of tools to work with.","April 17","true","20.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It\'s got tight controls, an environment rich with life and detail, and it brings an eerie ambiance and mystery. This game is definitely worth the $8 - I highly recommend it!\n\nTeleporters throughout the game do away with the grueling backtracking that completionists suffer during Metroid games. The bosses, enemies, and platforming puzzles are tough, but not unfairly so. This game never felt unfair or cheating.\n\nOne of the coolest items you earn in the game is the hookshot. An entire platforming game could be built around this mechanic alone, and it\'s very well done.\n\nIn terms of playtime, I\'m already nearly 10 hours in.","June 1","true","20.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is very much focused around exploring a huge map with varied environments to find new power-ups that help you explore further. This is coupled with finding random HP upgrades that are often hiding behind breakable walls and discovering the lore of the area you are exploring.\n\nOverall the game plays well. The controls are far more responsive than the game it pays homage too, which assists greatly in the epic boss fights and some incredibly difficult platforming segments. ESa makes very good use of allowing the player to traverse the environment using it's various power-ups even before the correct power-up for a certain segment is found. There were numerous times where determination and precision got me to an area I would have normally required a power-up I didn't have to get to.\n\nSpeaking of bosses, they are balls hard. You can't take very many hits, so most boss fights require the player to know all of the boss' attack patterns and how to deal with them. This is both a strength and weakness of the game. On one hand the bosses being so difficult made defeating them feel really satisfying. On the other, losing repeatedly to the same boss in it's last phase is frustrating as hell. This frustration also partly comes from having to reload from the last save point, which is only near a boss about half the time. The other half of the time you have some walking to do.\n\nThe only other gripe I had with the game was a brief segment in the middle where the game gave me no direction on where to go next. I still hadn't discovered enough power-ups to really explore the station fully on my own and I spent about 5 hours trying to figure out where the way forward was. This really messed with the pacing of the game.\n\nOverall I quite liked the game. I'd recommend it if you are looking for a Metroid-like experience, or you like games that are old-school hard.","June 1","true","19.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
