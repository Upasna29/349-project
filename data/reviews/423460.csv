I used to buy Trainz because they  were  good  value for money. Previous versions of the game   not only gave you a fully functional train oriented  world, they gave you masses of  free rolling stock and  engines  that would keep most train enthusiasts  happy  for   hundreds of hours. Sadly  the developers of  this new version of Trainz have jumped on the Railworks band wagon/cash cow and    added hundreds of pounds worth of  dlc with more to come.    I can't recommend this to anyone at this time and I'm very disappointed in  the Trainz dev's for introducing this model  to their  world.  The main difference between   this game and it's  competitor Train Simulation 2016 (formerly Railworks) is  that Railworks has    a much larger  seelection of  trains and  new rail routes (that are also expensive when not on sale)  plus the graphics are  in my opinion much better.   Also,     dlc for previous versions of  Trainz are not forwards compatible with this new version, whereas all  dlc purchased for  any version of Railworks is forwards compatible.\n\nThere's no way I'm going to re purchase   dlc for this game that I've already purchased for previous versions; shame on you  N3V games.   I think I'll be sticking with Train Simulator 2016  from now on.  Good-bye Trainz.","May 15","false","3.0"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

Its a shopping mall for N3V Games. Everything has to be bought as a extra. Then, most DLC's refer you to purchasing Trainz a new era! Or the DLC won't work. Whats the point of putting 2016 on the title if the sim is outdated already!\n","April 29","false","12.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","2","0","0"
