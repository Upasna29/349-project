It uses the acclaimed Artifex Mundi engine to great effect, offering lots of atmospheric scenes and the by now well-known hidden object-scenes this engine can provide. These scenes are sometimes easy enough with few objects to search between, but some of them are quite difficult with lots of object or some cleverly disguised ones. The minigames and puzzles, another custom element of these games, are mostly fine and well conceived, albeit often a tad easier than in the games developed by Artifex Mundi themselves.\n\nThe story is not particularly original, as it focuses on a female detective called upon to solve a mystery and a murder, but the different settings are very convincingly realised and the game has a good pace to it, without too much backtracking in order to get some kind of gear for some kind of newly discovered puzzle. Since this kind of game largely depends on its story to keep the interest going, that's a good thing, but there are also some shortcomings to the way the story is being told. First of all, the voice-acting is quite awkward and seldomly convincing. It has a very amateuristic feeling to it, as does the game music to be honest, which I turned off rather quickly. Ambient sounds on the other hand are crisp and fine and add quite a bit to the often (mildly) frightening atmosphere.\n\nAs I've become used to in this kind of games, there are a limited number of Steam achievements (13 in all), which are partly story-driven and partly connected to the hidden object-scenes and the mini-games or puzzles. They are not difficult to achieve, so this game is a nice contender for those wanting to increase their average achievements score, or their number of perfect games. The game also comes with some fine looking Steam trading cards.\n\nAll in all, quite a nice effort from a company of which we sadly haven't heard anything since.\n\nOverall score: 7/10","February 15, 2015","true","6.0"," 40 of 45 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","40","45","0","1"

Left in the Dark: No One on Board, is sadly a substandard for Artifex Mundi.\n\nIn this stand-alone adventure - hopefully stays that way - you play as the one and only, "Madam Detective". Seriously? No one even took the trouble of giving a proper name to the protagonist? Oh, well. Madam Detective is asked to investigate the mystery of a lost cargo ship. It is explained to us that the ship never reached its destination, found in the open sea without a crew and its cargo, sometime after its departure. Oh, also we have the ghost of a young girl who tries to sabotage us half way through the game, and aid us during the other half.\n\nMy first complaint is about the story's presentation. If you pay attention to the story and the obvious lack of function in procedure for the investigation of the ship, you know the identity of the murderer within the first 15 minutes that you play the game. The rest is spared to understand reasons, that's all. The bonus chapter that we expect in every Artifex Mundi game to shed some light into the background of affairs doesn't exist in this game, sorry.\n\nPuzzles are annoyingly basic. Hidden object scenes are so easy that it becomes boring after a while, and there is no alternating gameplay. There is an obscene amount of backtracking compared to other games. The setting and the art work is pretty, but not spectacular. I've seen better in 9 Clues or Grim Legends. You keep listening to the same 30 second music in the background again and again until you decide to mute it.\n\nI know it is not commonly expected for a HOG to bear decent story or event decent gameplay, but Artifex Mundi is supposed to be a decent contradiction to that idea. If this game would come from any other HOG developer I'd smile and write a brief recommendation. Not for Artifex Mundi. Oh wait, this isn't developped by Artifex Mundi! They are only the producer! Now the actual mystery of the game is explained! But why they've attached their name to this game? That is another mystery.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","August 13, 2015","false","3.2"," 44 of 52 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","44","52","4","3"

The best non Artifex Mundi developed hidden object game on Steam that I have played.This is the big one, VERY short. Normally without bugs I expect to playthrough in about 3-4 hours and then do a speed run on expert level to gain the expert level achievement if there is one and to mop up any other missed achievements. Giving a total time of around 6-7 hours skipping all of the cut scenes on the second play through.  This game took 3.2 hours to play though once with all the cutscenes running and once skipping them. So two play throughs, the first taking only 2 hours.\n\nGood thing it currently has 30% off.\n\nWould I recommend it, yes, it is well made, certainly compared with many of the hidden object games on Steam.

The visuals and the game's style is quite like most A.M. games, but on the mechanics level it's easy to notice it's lacking the Mundi polishment. Animations are shorter with less frames - instead of Showing the full animation for collecting special items, they just appear in the container, for example. (Not a problem, just wanted to show some differences between Mundi-made and Mundi-published games)\nMusic is quite good, and some "random" background noises are actually really well executed, especially in the forest area.\nHidden Object Scenes sadly have issues. Do you remember old cartoons, like Hanna-Barbera products, when you could tell what book will be moved on the bookshelf, because it wasn't as detailed as the others? (For younger audiences  an example[38.media.tumblr.com]) Lots of items are really easy to find because they are coloured much brightly than background and passive items, making HOSs a little too easy.\nStory is somewhat lacklusting for me. I don't know what was the problem with the atmosphere, but I just couldn't really care about the story - this is quite unusual, I really do pay attention to the story of a game, it's one of the most important part of the game for me.  In this case somehow a detective work turns into a ghost story with an ending that's on par with a Scooby Doo episode - the game suggest a darker, mystery-heavy story, yet at the end it's kind of childish to be a thrilling story, meanwhile it's still a little too dark to be a real child game.  This is not a real fail at all, just a little awkward - instead of a good setting for any of these two genres it turned to be an okayish hybrid.\n","December 29, 2014","true","5.1"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

I think, if you were to subtract the half an hour give or take, that I spent AFK, it would only take about 4 and a half hours, but that's because I had to play through it a second time on expert mode to get all of the achievements.\n\nIt was fun the first time through, but the second time it got a little tedious at parts, but I tend to get that feeling with hidden object games. If you do want to get all of the achievements, I recommend playing on expert mode the first time, and then avoiding the hint button while playing the hidden object puzzles, and don't skip any mini games, no matter how tempting. There are guides online to help with both the hidden object parts and the mini games if you need it.\n\nOverall, it was a fun game, and I enjoyed it.

On the one hand, I enjoyed the game (enough to do a second playthrough to finish the last two achievements).  On the other, the $9.99 price tag seems really steep for the length of the game.  I picked it up on sale so I have no regrets, but if I'd shelled out ten bucks for it, I'd have been mildly annoyed.  As of now, I have 3.7 hours on record with two full playthroughs, and that's simply not ten dollars worth of game to me.\n\nThat said, if you can grab it on sale, do so if you like this style combination of adventure/puzzle/hidden-object.  The story was simple but engaging enough, the puzzles were manageable (actually pretty easy, honestly), and the hidden object scenes were graphically well-done and ranged from easy to pretty challenging.  My only real complaint was the voice acting for your main character, which was not well done (overacted, hammed-up, over-the-top, pick your phrase but the idea is the same).  I couldn't stand hearing myself narrate.  But other than that, enjoyable game.\n\nTL;DR:  Pick it up on sale for a couple hours easy entertainment, but don't expect more than that.","February 27, 2015","true","3.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

I suppose like Enigmatis, it will rely on a second part to explain it all better. They also tried to add a plot twist to the end, but it is only a "surprise" due to the inconsistent artwork. I actually figured out the plot twist halfway through the game. Because of the lack of plot and character development, it's too obvious what is going on but there is never given a good reason why.\n\nThey have the same detective voice as most other games and she is much worse here than in the other games. She is fine when she has a neutral tone to speak in, but whenever she is supposed to portray screaming, terror, shock... she just sounds bored. It ruined the immersion when the voice doesn't sound like it belongs in the scene.\n\nThe hidden object scenes have mostly items that can be seen, but unfortunately also have some that are too small too find. Like identifying a different shape in a patch of grass.\n\nAs for the mini-games, they were too easy. I usually can't clear every single minigame and skip some.

This one is a bit of a disapointment really. This was outsourced and it shows. The Hidden object games are mostly hit and miss. Some of the items are the exact color of background scene making almost mandatory that you click the hint button.\n\nThe story isnt that well thought out and what should be a roller coaster ride ends up being a tame story in the end. I did finish the game and was expected you can expect 2 hours out of the game. Its very short. Also you can tell the outsource team was lazy as they have the same HOG scene that you have to do twice with the same object that you didnt click before. Now you have to click on the second set. They also look a little blury as well. Does it really take that much time to make another set of HOG scenes?\n\nThe puzzles are boring and mostly trial and error. One of the puzzles involves a family tree no less. I suppose that wouldnt have been bad if they gave you some hint in your diary.  I couldnt find it. The price for this is crazy high for 2 hours. Thats $5 dollars an hour. If you can find the game cheap like I did. I paid $2 dollar for this and one other HOG game then its worth it otherwise save your money. Graphics while sparse are  not bad and do look very good. Sound effects are also good and the voice of the women is the same that does Nightmare from the deep. A ok game if you can find it cheap otherwise their are much better games out their for the same price.\n\nI own a lot of HOG's on steam and would  recommend Abyss: the wraiths of eden.

This is the first game I've 100 percented on steam, so that should give you an idea of its relative difficulty, especially considering I dont play these kind of games normally.    Graphis seem better suited for a mobile game, story is mediocre at best, mechanics, well how do you screw up a point and click, so they get a point for that one.\n\nOverall I'm giving it a 4/10, and thats being generous I think, because I dont like the genre, or at least I did not like this game, I wouldve rated it a 2, but I think my dislike of the genre may be affecting my opinion.  So I may try a couple more HOGs before I decide for sure they arent for me.  If you are looking for a quick easy 100% this is the game for you.  If you want an in depth story, challenging puzzles, then look elsewhere.","April 2","false","6.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

Left in the Dark: No One on Board is a short but surprisingly good hidden object puzzle game with a nice horror theme. The game was made with hand drawn graphics and art which is amazingly well done and you can just see that there was a lot of love, time, and effort put into this game. Some of the puzzles are easy while some were genuinely brain boggling. I liked the hidden object puzzles as they required me to closely examine the entire scene to locate needed items and some of them are so hidden so well the untrained eye will spend a good five to ten minutes looking for them.\n\nThe voice acting is subpar but does not really spoil the mood and feel of the game as it provides enough to keep you entertained throughout.\n\nHowever, I am not too impressed by the cliche feeling of the ending but it doesn't stop me from recommending this good puzzle game. It will take around five hours to complete and is a nice and easy game to get all the achievements on.","May 10, 2015","true","7.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It has a decent engine and beautiful graphics, but it is too easy.\n\nThe puzzles weren't challenging and you didn't have any difficult achievements. You could finish everything in Expert Mode within a few hours without having to consult an online guide even once.\n\nMaybe it's because it was developed by a different studio and only published by Artifex Mundi, I don't know. But I have played other games of theirs which were a dozen times more challenging and more fun (also story-wise).","February 24","false","6.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Gameplay consists of searching for different objects in locations available to you, to you use at other locations, minigames (that name the subgenre) where the player completes a checklist of random objects to locate in a fixed screen and other puzzles.\n\nEvaluationThe gameplay is a bit poor. HOG games already make for excellent casual games, for having linear gameplay, shallow story and plain difficulty curve. One could stop playing a HOG for a month to retake it later with very little loss. So content and duration should compensate for the lack of other qualities. But one way or the other, much of the gameplay in this genre (for what I have experienced) is spent navigating the map searching for an active zone that has been activated and will grant you an object that you need in other part of the map. How random are those objects and the locations where you find them also impact the game. That randomness is good for a casual game but not really for a game trying to make an impact.\n\nThe game is short. I finished the game in less than three hours (the rest of the played time comes from the first installation and idling for cards). It doesn't have much content (few HOG minigames, easy puzzles, even if had one or two I hadn't yet seen in a HOG [yes, HOGs have all very similiar puzzles]). And the content it has (and I include the story when I say content), has the same shallowness and randomness. See a pair of examples in the spoiler.\n\n[not so spoiler]The main character is Madam(e?) Detective. Yes, that's her name. Maybe it's a template technique to allow the player to put in the shoes of the main character. In other HOGs you never see the main character; in this one, you can see her in some cutscenes. But, yeah, ok, Madame Detective, pleased to meet you, I'm Mister Reviewer.[/not so spoiler]\n\nMadame Detective must make glue by heating gum in a tin can over a camp fire. Then she needs a glove to pick the tin can with the glue. Later in the game, she forges a gear by melting iron in a forge and molding it. The "fresh" gear is immediately added to her inventory.\nAnd the innumerable, characteristic 2-4 random lost puzzle pieces you must find to start a random puzzle to get another random lost puzzle piece.\n\nArt is kind of solvent, nothing out of the ordinary. Locations, objects and animations have the standard Artifex Mundi quality. Cutscenes are ok. I even recognize that I tried this particular game for the close-up of Madame Detective featured in the video, where she looks more interesting than she proves to be.\n\nShe is scared of every little silly thing.\n\nMusic and sound effects are unremarkable (did the game have any music at all?).\n\nConclusionsThe game is not bad per se, it's decent even. But it doesn't really provide anything new. So it's plain. Even bad games often have new, risky mechanics that don't really work and may be interesting for a while.\nPros:\n+Under average. Not bad per se. Just a 5/10.\n+Achievements are easy to get, if you care for them.\nCons:\n-Total cliché, for the gameplay, for the story, for the characters...\n-Little content.\n\nVeredictNot recommended.\nIf you got it in a bundle, like me, you surely have many more interesting games. Should be at the bottom of your stack of games to play.\nIf you don't have it, skip it unless you are bored and hungry for HOGs, and it's cheap.\n\nDisclaimer. I'm not a particular fan of the genre. I've played some games of the same publisher and maybe others and I found many to be much more remarkable than this one.","April 6","false","6.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

There's no single, overriding reason.  Just a combination of many issues.  First, even for a casual adventure Hidden Object Game (HOG), the voice acting (especially the male voices) are bad.  Second, the HOGs are a bit tough to do.  Not for any puzzle-based reason.  But, because the graphics are very muddy.  The HOGs look sort of like paintings and figuring out what's what is hard.  Third, even the sounds aren't that good.  Some of the birds sound like flutes instead of birds.  And finally, the game is just too short.  It took me exactly three hours to finish the game with 100% Achievements.  That wasn't even long enough to get all the Trading Cards.  I had to let the game idle for an additional 20 minutes after I was done to get my final card drop.  This is especially bad for a game with a list price of almost $10.  So, on the whole, I'd say pass on this game.  If you find it for a dollar or two, you could give it a whirl.

Not recommended.\n\nReviewYou play as Madam Detective, an apparently nameless yet famous detective. You’re hired to investigate the mysterious disappearance of the crew and cargo of a ship. Almost immediately you are set upon by ghosts and a hooded guy running around with a big hook. If that sounds like the plot of a really bad horror movie… well, it is. The story never rises above bad and the presentation doesn’t improve it. There is very little interaction with other characters; rather most of the story is told through notes and papers with incredibly ugly fonts that don’t match the world at all. I appreciate that they want to make it easy to read, but that can be done without making it incredibly ugly.\n\nStill, the story is not the worst part. The mini-games are few and far between. The HOGs are of the “find 12 items that are completely unrelated to the story and one that you’ll need” variety. At the beginning they have some items being hidden, but even that is abandoned after a few HOG sections. This means that despite the game being very short (I finished it on expert mode with all achievements in 2.5 hours), it still manages to get boring and repetitive. Without a compelling story or interesting gameplay it gets very difficult to recommend this game, even at the low price I got it (1.5 Euro).","November 23, 2015","false","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is a hidden object/puzzle game woven together in a story.  You can choose the level of difficulty you prefer.  Mini games can be challenging but hints are available and it is possible to skip a mini game should it prove too difficult to solve.   A map makes navigation between scenes less repetitive.  The graphics are good.  I found the story line interesting.  A sense of urgency develops as one nears the completion of the game.  While some may choose to replay the game to win all the achievements I don't think replaying the game would be as satisfying.  If you are confident in your puzzle solving skills, you may decide to choose a more advanced difficulty level.   I played the game through in several sessions on the low difficulty setting, but a more experienced gamer would probably be able to complete the game in two or three sessions.","August 23, 2015","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After seeing how well recieved most Artifex Mundi developed and published games were, I decided to take a chance. The story revolves around a young woman dectective brought in to solve a case involving a ship and it's missing crew. While the story is not amazing, it kept me interested enough for the the 3 hours or so the game takes to complete.  I definately wouldn't mind returning to the world in a sequel.\n\nI really enjoyed the beautiful areas of the game. Almost evey area and hidden object area was very well done and quite detailed. Only one or two areas maybe didn't match up to the rest of the game. For the most part, the hidden object sections are fairly easy. However, there is a hint system is place if you get stuck. The puzzles in the game are pretty easy too, with a hint system for those that might need it.  There is also difficultly settings that change how easy it is to spot interaction points and how the hint system works.\n\nThere is voice acting in the game and it is decent. The two female main characters voices are fine, with other being passable. Nothing horrible though.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed is game and look forward to trying some more Hidden Object games.","July 9, 2015","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Theres a few decent ones. Lots of ok ones and some terrible ones. This is the later. Its just very dull and boring. Some things are barely noticable at all and is generally just really badly dne. Avoid this and try one of the others out would be my best advice.","April 23","false","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you like HOGs this is a good one. Story makes not a shred of sense, voiced by someone with slightly better than passing familiarity with the English language, but whose Ps Ds Ts and Ss are all a bit Germanically emphatic. Scenes are colourful and pretty, puzzles are fair and evenly paced.\n\nIt's not memorable, but if you want something to stick in the memory, read a good book. This gets nothing wrong and when it's in the sale, it's a perfect way to lose a few mindless hours in a point-n-click simulation of a moment of absence.\n\n","June 6","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
