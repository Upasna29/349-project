"http://steamcommunity.com/id/badwhippet/recommended/353640/","badwhippet","Moonwind","http://steamcommunity.com/id/badwhippet/","568 products in account","What is it?Train Valley is a casual game where you must lay tracks to connect multiple stations to each other, and route trains without crashes or delays with the goal of sending trains to the correct station marked by a coloured flag.  It's not a tycoon or serious transport management sim and there is no cargo or passenger quota to manage.  It's more a strategy/puzzle type of game that challenges you to meet a set of goals before time or money run out.\n\nWhat's to like about it?It's silly in a fun way as the difficulty ramps up and you find yourself frantically clicking switches in the hope of avoiding crashes or wrongly-routed trains.  Some trains are faster and longer than others and it soon becomes manic.  Don't even think of trying a delaying tactic!  Keep a train waiting long enough and it will release itself whether you're ready or not!  The tutorial is somewhat scant but the game is intuitive to play with a simple interface.  You are not automatically thrown out of the game if you suffer a collision (luckily) though your profits take a hit and you'll probably need to do some track repairs.  You are given a set of objectives to meet for each location - of increasing difficulty with a greater number of stations to be served.\n\nWhat's not to like?Quite honestly, not much.  At first, it feels a bit TOO casual (ie Facebook style) but as the difficulty and number of stations ramp up, the game becomes a real challenge of strategy and timing.  The graphics are somewhat muddy and aliased (no in-game options to correct this).   Station colours can be a bit obscured by train flags at times when there are a lot of things going on, and a couple of colours are a little too similar which adds unnecessarily to the level of difficulty (for example: the orange and yellow station colours look very similar).  These are all minor gripes however, and don't detract from the fun of the game.\n\nIn summary...Train Valley is no 'Sid Meier' or other type of management or tycoon sim, but it's a fun and addictive little game easily worth its low price.

The player connects train stations and makes sure trains reach their correct destination by changing switches on the railroad he/she build himself/herself.\n\nThe game has a nice simplistic menu that is shaped as a stockbook (book that is used by stamp collectors). Every Postage stamp in it is a level of the game. There are 20 levels total. The game has two game modes. One of them is classic mode which consist of levels that has a time and money limit, and also have optional objectives. The other mode is sandbox. As the name suggests, there are no restrictions and limits. Also in this mode, the player decides stations’ spawn time and when a train is scheduled from a station. At the beginning, all levels except the first one is locked. New levels are opened by beating the previous level. To play sandbox version of a level, the player needs to beat the same level in classic mode.\n\nFirst level is a tutorial level that shows basics of the game. Although it shows the most important parts of the game with nice message boxes, other parts are only mentioned in small bubbles that can be easily missed. Luckily, game is very simple and can be learned in a few games. That said, it would be nice to have a better tutorial.\n\nA level starts with two stations. Player is given some money to build railroads. After that trains start to be scheduled. When such train is scheduled, an icon appears on the station it is in. Then player starts the train by simply clicking it. That said, it is not possible to make a train wait forever. After an unknown time, it starts to count down from 5 and moves when the countdown reaches zero. As time passes, more stations are spawned making the game and railroad network more complicated. That said, it will never be too complicated as a tycoon but has its challenges of its own.\n\nOrigin and destination of a train is handled very nicely in the game. It is color coded. Every train and station has a color on it. And the purpose is to make a train reach the station with the same color. When the train reaches its destination, the player gets the money. Amount of money is determined at the time of the spawn of a train. After that it will start decreasing even if the train is still in the starting station.\n\nThis game is not a detailed tycoon game. It is designed as a puzzle-strategy game. The main purpose of the game in a level is not to bankrupt, but in this game, “bankrupt” means “negative money”. There are no loans, no maintenance cost, no economy. The player earns money by making a train reach its correct destination. After that he/she uses the money to build railroads to connect newly spawned stations. Every game year, a constant tax is debited from the money. There are only two ways the player’s money goes below zero; tax and train crash. As soon as the player’s money is negative, he/she loses. This mechanic is the games strategy part.\n\nThe puzzle part is more interesting. Because the actual puzzle is built by the player without him/her realizing. After connecting a few stations with railroads, railroads become a (simple) maze with switches left and right. More stations mean more railroads with more switches. It is never possible to create a network without switches because of either landscape or money constraints. Towards the end of a level, the player keeps clicking switches to send the trains to correct road and prevent crashes. This is the most fun part of the game.\n\nSounds in the game is nice and relaxing but it would be better to have a few different sound tracks.\n\nTotal game length is a bit short. There are 20 levels but if the player doesn’t care about optional objectives, then they will end quickly.\n\nPros:+ Simplistic: All menus and tabs are cleverly put together in a clear and simple manner.\n\n+ Relaxing: Because it is simple and lacks ambition, it is fit to be played just to relax.\n\nCons:- Short: Don’t have many levels.\n\nVerdict:Train valley is a nice and relaxing game. It gives the feeling of playing actual toy trains and if you like trains, you probably will like this game. That said, because it is short, I recommend it to be best considered as a side game when you got bored of other stuff.\n\nP.S: As a rule, I won't comment on price tag. Everyone has a different opinion on whether it is worth the price tag or not. So it is up to you to decide.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group\n\nEdit: Fixed some typos and formatting","October 18, 2015","true","5.8"," 26 of 35 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","26","35","0","0"

It's quite a good game too: fun, challenging and pretty to boot.\n\n\nHowever, I have to say that Train Valley reminds me of an older train puzzle game, one near and dear to my heart: 3D Ultra Lionel TrainTown[www.xtcabandonware.com], developed in 2000 by Dynamix. Whereas that game focused on completing missions and solving puzzles, in Train Valley your main goal is to simply survive until the end of a level without going bankrupt, although completing side goals earns you stamps of recognition.\n\nTrain Valley has players reenact a more realistic depiction of railroading history - although it's mainly in the background - all the while attempting to stay afloat and expand to meet the needs of industry. Players take the role of a trainmaster, which means sending and routing trains to their intended destination.\n\nTrainTown has you manually hauling freight such as ore to smelters, hamburgers to grills, or numbers to multiplication equations. It plays its Lionel model train aesthetic to the hilt and is definitely "wackier", if you're into that sort of thing. Controlling multiple locomotives at the same time is only really needed in the later levels; although it's possible in every level, you'll usually only need to control one train at a time in the early game.\n\nIn TrainTown, one crash fails a level, and some of those levels were as complex as any you may find in Train Valley. I mean, if the first set of levels was intended for elementary school kids, the last set was probably meant for college sophomores. I feel comfortable in saying TrainTown is harder, but oh so satisfying to play as well.\n\n\nI know this is a recommendation for Train Valley, which I absolutely recommend for puzzle and train fans, but if you like it I'd say you should give TrainTown a shot too. It's more or less abandonware at this point anyway, no harm in trying it.","November 21, 2015","true","1.4"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","18","21","0","9"

This is an active puzzle game, that just happens to involve trains.\n\nThat having been said, it does combine two of my favorite things, trains games and puzzle games. I never thought that I'd somehow have 30 hours in the game, it's something that I just kept on coming back to, having this need to finish all three stamps on all maps, including the DLC.\n\nPersonally I love the fact that there's a speed function that lets me play fast and just pause when I need to, it makes for a super great challenge (until they put in no pausing as a stamp requirement in the new DLC that made me sad).\n\nI personally experienced no crashes of any sort, only in the DLC did I have a bit of a bug where the main menu wouldn't pop up if I hit escape, which was basically just a trifling annoyance.\n\nTo sum it up: I love finding little unknown games like this which I end up enjoying way more than I ever thought I would, and I'm highly looking forward to future DLC!","April 14","true","30.2"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

So I guess that's good.\n\nIt is not a classic "Tycoon" game, as you might have figured out from the screenshot, more like a halfway point of that and a puzzle game like, say, Air Control. Which is good! The levels really change up the core gameplay of "somehow get a bunch of trains from A to B without them all crashing into each other" in some interesting ways, and some of the Russian and Japanese levels require LOTS of concentration.\n\nI would say I had more fun with this than with many of the "real" railway management sims. Two things, though:\n\n* I'd like to have more content. There's enough right now to justify the price point, but after going through most of the levels, I'd still like to go on. So give me some DLC and I'll buy that stuff.\n* There are still some glitches, which also occasionally forced me to restart levels.

Explore new worlds and learn the rail management skills to build, manage, and rule your great rail empire.  No train enthusiast on a budget can go without this game. There are a few kinks (i.e. buildings spawning on laid tracks and trains spontaeously exploding for no reason) but they are so rare or predicatable you can adapt to your situation.  I am proud to say I had the privelege to enjoy this game from early developement, and you can witness that experience for yourself in my let's play from the earliest alpha release to the most recent patch (a7.4/beta1.0 at this period) here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLq7fziG4I2WvsbCzGsxICVvHoK4CpOiuq\n\nI personally want to thank Flazm.com and Oroboro Games for the fantastic experience they provided me and cannot wait for the next patch.  There is so much more to experience!\n\nAdvice for new users:\n\n-the bell, whistle or horn sound a locomotive makes leaving a station in this patch gives you a cue of how fast it will go regardless of what it looks like (mid or late 19th century steam, 20th century steam, early diesel, modern diesel)\n-the grid matrix in build mode is your friend; drag your cursor from a place that has track wherever you want, just be sure you are aware of how you drag your mouse cursor\n-dirt roads on game maps give you a hint about how to configure your tracks\n-compact triangular swicthing junctions are essential for saving money and space, crosing tracks are not\n-plot your track configuations while the game is paused to be safe (or don't for an extra challenge) :3\n-train crashes require track replacement at the point of impact (unless the impact point is in a station)\n-don't leave a train sitting in a station sitting for too long; it will eventually leave\n-consider in game annual taxes paid each new year before building or adding more trains (which both cost money)\n-trains going into the wrong station will go straight in and swing back out instantly, so be careful\n-avoid building over existing map strutures to save more money where reasonable\n-game logic prevents trains from derailling on switches regardless of which way they are oriented\n-building new tracks under existin tracks with trains still running on them will cause derailments (game logic won't save you here)\n-enjoy yourself\n\nP.S. (Please don't throw rocks at me for sounding like a brown-noser, I just like this game a lot.)\n","May 9, 2015","true","72.8"," 18 of 26 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","18","26","0","0"

What it is, is a puzzle game - and once you get a few levels in, it's fiendish.  It conjurs up the correct mix of raising a smile when things go to plan, and swearing at your screen when you get overwhelmed and the inevitable happens - and trains crash.\n\nThe premise is simple; you are given a grid and two coloured stations on each map, and you drag lines from one to the other, avoiding or bulldozing (at a cost) your way through buildings and trees, some of which are randomly placed whilst some are always in the same place.  Trains will spawn in the stations with a colour indicating that they want you to direct them to the other station, you click to launch the train and it makes its way down the track and you get paid when it arrives - each train has a value which ticks down from the moment it spawns to the moment it arrives at the destination.  The complexity comes in as the map progresses.  New stations will spawn on the map - in predetermined positions but in a random order, and begin to spawn trains all eager to go somewhere else.  You will lay more tracks, launch trains, and use the track switches to try and avoid a catastrophe.  Fortunately you can stop and reverse trains, but this doesn't always help if you're not keeping a good watch out - only one train can occupy a station, so it will launch itself if a second one is about to spawn.\n\nThe difficultly ramps up; early maps serve to teach you the basics and later ones cram stations in awkward places with choke points to force trains onto the same pieces of track.  When things go well, it's great - but sometimes, you just can't avoid an explosion.\n\nBack to my search for a tycoon game - even though this clearly isn't one, the art style and simple way of laying track would lend itself very well to a more in depth strategy game which, if I were the developer, I'd seriously consider.","May 21","true","3.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","7","7","2","0"

This is no Railroad Tycoon or Industry Giant. It is more of a micro management focused virtual model railway. If that sounds strange and unconventional to you you might want to check out the free demo first.\n\nThe gameplay consists only marginally of financial management and largely of creating track layouts and manual train guidance. The challenge comes from creating connections between set stations and handling an ever growing amount of railway traffic that will put your planning skills to the test. With the help of 3 different game speeds and a pause button at your disposal you can decide yourself how reflex heavy each level will be.\n\nThis game is best played in short bursts since each level can be finished within minutes. Yet it maintains a decently high level of replayability, especially for players that like to maximize their efficiency and want to perfect track layouts for optimal capacity.\n\nThe level design is appealing and varied with an almost toy-like aesthetic. And the music is appropriately soothing and up-beat. Though it might get repetetive if you decide to 'binge' the game and finish it one sitting.\nDepending on your personal aim in terms of perfection and Highscores that may take you between 5 and 20 hours.\n\nOverall you can expect a very pleasent experience for a rather low price tag.","January 8","true","43.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

I love train games, but there hasn't been a good one out in a while.  Ironically, one of the first train games I ever played was Shortline Railroad in the early 90's, which is very similar to this game.  The first few levels were really easy, and I was worried at first that the game might not provide enough of a challenge, but the difficulty picks up pretty quickly after that.

Someone also compared it to "Lionel's(?) Train Town" which is also a fair comparison to make!\n\nTo start with, it's not a tycoon game so don't be fooled by the images if they look like a Railroad Tycoon. The game is more focused on being a puzzle game based around trains. I'm sure if you've played Railroad Tycoon or the like you've had to overcome complicated junctions or network improvements the puzzles tend to focus on that skill - placing stations in awkward places.\n\nEvery so often the game will general a train which will be at one of the stations (there's a gauge timer thing at the bottom right of the screen so you can see when the next train will generate) - you can also call on addional trains to create additional revenue. The train will be assigned a colour and you have to create a route via the switches/junctions you've made in your solution to get the train to it's destination. Laying track and destroying objects costs money and, along with a tax you have to pay, your balance can deplete quickly - going below 0 results in bankrupcy and you lose the game.\n\nThere are four different regions progressing in difficulty. Difficulty in this game is present through awkwardly placed stations, objects to either neogotiate around or destroy and build over at an addition cost (depends on what you destroy for cost) and the challenges present in each level (spend x money, don't let trains go to the wrong stations, etc) create some replayability.\n\nThis is a fun puzzler and the trains were just a bonus (well, at least for me anyway).","December 12, 2015","true","7.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

That's good, because this game hits all those likes of mine to some degree, and I love it for that.\n\nWhat you do:  you build tracks between stations, and dispatch trains that the game randomly builds (or, you can summon your own in addition to the random ones).  Each scenario is a bit different--goals for specific scenarios don't vary within the scenario, but placement of stations and obstacles do to a degree.  In general, goals are of the variety:  don't crash trains, build X amount of track, make X amount of money, manually summon X amount of trains.  These sound simple, but the land area of each scenario is small and you need to make efficient rail networks in that small space without going bankrupt.\n\nAdditional stations appear as the game progresses, so you have to modify your rail network on the fly.  This isn't a surprise after your first scenario, but they are also placed somewhat randomly in a random order, meaning you have to think on the fly.  Thankfully, the game does include a pause button and you should make use of it often.  You direct the trains as you go, throwing switches to put trains on specific paths.  Screw up switching even once, and you may be restarting the scenario if it's a bad enough miss.  :)\n\nGood:  engaging play, certainly not a piece of cake, but not impossible either.  Graphics are clean and perfect for this kind of game.  Music and sounds work well and fit the game.  Bugs are pretty much non-existent.\n\nMeh:  keyboard shortcuts appear to be unlabeled nor identified, and not changeable.  Some of them can wreak havoc with your game.  No ability to save in mid level, and scenarios aren't super quick.\n\nBad:  Scenarios often have razor thing win margins.  This is not unusual for optimization puzzle games, but can be frustrating if you've never played one before.  So, perhaps this isn't a "bad" thing, as I'd sure not want this changed.  Still, it comes as a warning--not so much to stay away from the game, but don't give up on it too quickly.\n\nOverall:  Highly recommended for those who like optimizing things for fun, designing rail networks in confined spaces, and choo choo trains.  Easily frustrated by puzzles?  Probably not for you.","May 28, 2015","true","74.3"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","9","14","0","0"

One of the few games I can see trying to do all the achievements . If my time log is right, I 'beat' this in 18 hours, but I can see the challenge of getting most of the remaining achievements worth another 10 or 20 hours alone. I wish it would have overlaid another level of challenge on each level with some kind of star ranking based on money earned or some other metric. Instead, it general gives you three objectives, so 'beating' a level 'completely' is meeting the three objectives, which is often very challenging. But it would add even more replayability if it set an income level for a bronze, silver, and gold medal, or a three-star rating, for example.\n\nThe game feels like someone boiled down a Railroad Tycoon game until the concentrated essense that was left fit on one screen and took maybe 20 or 30 minutes at the very most to complete.

The main aim for Train Valley is to link a bunch of stations in close proximity and get the trains to the other stations as quickly as possible without them crashing into one another or going to the wrong station (colour coded).  Some also have objectives relating to the number of trains you must run before the time runs out or how much you need to earn (get them to stations quicker and/or run more trains).\n\nThis is pretty simply to play, but it requires constant attention  You are constantly fipping track switches to make the trains follow the correct route.

Yes it does require micromanagement, but did not need me to micromange a bunch of things. It need a little more thought in how and where I built tracks and use of my money. It is a nice game to just relax with and if you like to have a podcast or something else going on the side, at least for myself anyway.\nThe graphics, while I don't speak for everyone, are nice. They make me feel like a kid playing with a model train set. It almost makes me want to go out and buy a model train set, but this was alot cheeper and had less of the mess. The graphics are not overly intensive but then again there really is no reason they need to be, but that is just my opinion.

However, my opinion is not biased and is honest to how I feel ab out the game.\nTrain Valley has been sitting in my Steam Library since October, and I only downloaded it today when I was bored. To my surprise, it's a lot of fun. For the (almost) hour I've played, I have enjoyed every minute.\n\nFirstly, Train Valley has an outstanding almost cartoonish art style.\n\nSecondly, The game has a lot of content. With over 24 levels, each lasting about 15 minutes(or longer), there's a lot to get through. Not to mention the Sandbox mode, which allows you play all the aforementioned with unlimited money and other game changing bonuses.\n\nThirdly, I enjoyed the sound track. Great ambient music.\n\nLast but not least, Train Valley is extremely well optimised. On the highest settings, I was easily generating way over 60fps. Allowing for an enjoyable, good looking experience.\nOverall, the game is great. But it's not very original. I've seen these game idea countless times online, usually free too. However, the quality and quantity of content in Train Valley cannot be beaten.\n\nI highly recommend this game and I would of definitely paid the £6.99/$9.99 price premium had I not been offered it for free.\n\nCorrection:  I discovered this game is capped at 60fps, which I was easily maxing out.","January 23","true","1.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

If you don't see the appeal to tower defence at all, this game is not for you. If you've got the tower defence itch, this game will scratch it until it bleeds.\n\nThis game doesn't have an undo button, so push your luck too far and it's game over. I know why that would put some people off, but it works for this game.\n\nWhy is this better than tower defence? In any good tower defence game, getting good at it means learning how the towers work and how each enemy type works. Once you've figured that out, there's not much left to learn or do.\n\nWith this game, the trains behave the same way (at different speeds) and the track laying rules are intuitive. Will you overpopulate your grid with trains to build up money, or will you play it safer with collissions, but risk facing bankruptcy? Can you time them perfectly so they almost hit but don't? What is the best configuration for the tracks? Is it worth paying extra to demolish your way through a shortcut? These dilemmas you get to face from game 1, without having to remember what does what.\n\nThere is only one change I would make to this game if I were the developer, and that is this: When the game is paused, I want to still be able to see which trains are going full speed and which trains have only started moving. As a father, I love a game that I can pause and come back to after a nappy change, but I often forget which trains are going full speed and which are not by the time I return.","May 31","true","32.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You should build the optimal track to connect stations, choose which train to dispatch earlier to earn more (each train has different length and speed), avoiding train crashes or arrival to the wrong destination and other stuff which makes this management strategy so cool! Each level is well designed. Some obstacles on the way makes building the track more challenging, but not too hardcore at the same time. Main menu is a separate cute thing.

You build tracks and guide trains to their respective stations, tryingto hurry them as fast as you can while also avoiding mistakes such as crashing trains together or delivering them to the wrong station. The goals are fun, and the later levels are actually a lot more challenging than I expected. I think it will still take me a few hours to beat all the levels and collect all of the task badges.\n\nHowever, I expected a lot more worldbuilding to be involved. When choosing "Sandbox" mode, you get to chose out of all the levels to center your trains, but you have unlimited money, no tasks, and a very tiny, prebuilt playing field. I honestly bought this game looknig for the worldbuidling aspect, but was pleasently surprised with a different kind of experience. Still, I -really- wish I could build cities, make my own stations, and actually run a rail in a huge environment. Maybe the later levels will resolve this.

It's economics are exceedingly simple as is the user interface.\n\nThe basic game play is simple.  Lay track, control swiches, send trains to the right stations, don't run trains into each other or off the track.\n\nThe challenges, however, can be very difficult.  You may be required to earn a specific minimum amount of money while getting all your dispatches perfect, and doing so will require you to schedule extra trains that you can only just barely get enough routed, while trying to make sure you're switches are all lined up so the trains don't run into each other and end up on the right track.\n\nSome reviewers have said the game is short.  This is true- there are only 24 scenarios and no scenario takes more than an hour.  However, the harder scenarios have great replay value and frankly will take many attempts to master anyway.\n\nFor enthusiasts of games like Railroad Tycoon (and I am a HUGE fan myself), this takes train management down several notches to the level of operating your own home layout - which quite frankly is something I've no doubt many people have been longing for because for all the wonderfullness of Railroad Tycoon, what it is NOT is a train dispatcher simulation.  Train Valley is.\n\nPros:\n- Simple interface, simple economics\n- You run trains, not companies\n- Scenario complexity is just the right level of hard\n- Feels like a home train layout vs. a national railroad model\n\nCons:\n- UI needs refinement\n- A little cutesy looking\n- Feels like a home train layout vs. a national railroad model (yes this could be a pro OR con)\n\nOverall?  4 stars with potential.","February 18","true","35.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I have been playing it every night.  I do not regret purchasing it.  It is a fun experience of train traffic management.\n\nRough around the edges though.  The missions are absolutely homogenous.  Any difference between the 'Japan' and 'wherever else' missions was lost on me.  Considering how interchangeable and unmemorable the missions are, I am a little surprised there were not twice as many.  The experience is compelling, so I want more.  And some tiered achievements would encourage level replay -- the levels are easy to triple-crown the first time through.  So what am I going to replay them for?  I would like to replay them so that I can get Super Platinum Ultra but there is no such possibility.\n\nIt could use a bit more polish.  The trains enter buildings, and you can see them pop-out.  This hurts my eyes.  Please do not do this.   Pop them out once they are completely hidden from the player.\n\nAnd you're allowed to build train tracks where future train stations will appear, spontaneously, without warning.  Why would this be allowed?  It is completely disruptive to train traffic when a train station suddenly blocks the way.   This is completely opaque and unpredictable for the player.  It is the 'blue shell' of Train Valley.\n\nSo, the game is broken in a few ways, but I still couldn't stop playing it.

Trying to manage the trains, the   tracks and your money and income on each progressively more difficult level is loads of fun.  25/30.\n\n- CONTROLS & BUGS (worth 20 points):  The controls are simple and easy to figure out, and this is nice allowing you to focus on the mission objectives, track switches, and everything else that is part of this game.

My early access review for this game is an 83%.

Cursing at Train Switches from 1830 to 2020.Genre: Indie Micromanagement Puzzle Game.\nDeveloped and Published by: Oroboro Games & Flazm.\nPlatform: Windows, MacOSX and Linux.\nBusiness Model: Base Game + Upcoming DLC\nCopy Purchased by Myself Read the full & unabridged review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]\n\nOverall Gameplay Thoughts\nTrain Valley, a quirky little title that got a surprising amount of press attention considering this is the publisher’s first game. Are we really that starved for train management styled games that anything that resembles one needs to be checked out? The answer is probably yes. The genre has been forever dominated by Open Train Tycoon, Train Tycoon Deluxe and the like for the past 20 years. Entries into the genre are far and few between, often lacking in quality. Here’s the thing, Train Valley isn’t a management game in the traditional sense. Not by a long shot. This is more of a puzzle game where the single objective is to figure out how to solve the level without running out of cash and subsequently going bankrupt. Everything else is a secondary concern.\n\nOn the surface, it looks like a simple micromanagement game and it is but there’s some mechanics woven in to make the experience more interesting. All you’ll be doing is deploying trains, building track and managing switches. During the level, trains need to be deployed and delivered to their destination station as soon as possible for a couple of reasons: each train has a money value, that’s rewarded to the player upon completion, which slowly deteriorates over time. Additionally, trains will launch automatically from the station after a certain amount of time. The only warning you’ll get is a five second notification before they launch. So, you need to make sure that stations are regularly deploying trains to prevent any accidents from occurring. This is made more complicated by the levels themselves which will spawn additional stations which need to be connected to the rest of the line and increasingly faster trains. Furthermore, there’s an in-game annual tax that you have to make sure to have money for. So, avoid being greedy or risk losing the level. Finally, as time passes, buildings will crop up over time that you may need to maneuver around or destroy (costing a lot of money).\n\nContent Thoughts\nThere are four chapters in total that are centered around a particular nation (or group of nations) that create the overall theme for each level and the trains you’ll see. This includes Europe, the United States, Russia and Japan. Over the course of each chapter, the levels will transition from the early 1830s to the modern age of 2020 while featuring a certain time era for that nation in the level. This changes what the trains look like as well. In terms of how it affects mechanics, the changing of time will increase the length of the trains and make them faster. For each chapter, there’s five challenge levels and one score attack level. Each challenge level also comes with the option to continue the level forever once you’ve finished it. For each level, there’s three optional goals you can try to shoot for and you don’t have to get all of them in one go. These goals can range from never wrecking a train, to gaining a certain amount of money to not allowing a train arrive at the wrong destination. They can be challenging to acquire, especially the gaining X amount of money, and may require several redos. I recommend trying to finish one of them during a level because they’ll add challenge to the levels and give them their own personality. It would have been nice if the achievements you had already completed were marked as such but it’s not a big deal. The score attack level is the culmination of the entire chapter. It plays the entire time period for the nation in one go from 1800s to 2000s while also doubling the in-game speed. This can be very tricky to deal with as it means taxes come twice as fast even though your trains stay at the same speed. Good luck on the Japan level, it’s brutally difficult.\n\nPC Settings\nSettings for Train Valley are decent, if limited. Video settings only include two sliders for resolutions and quality. You’ll probably run the quality at “fantastic” unless you’re trying to run this off a toaster. Resolution choices seem pretty good and it maxes out at the monitor’s resolution. The game has a cheap 3D look to it so it’s not like there’s any options missing. Fullscreen on/off and colorblind mode are included as well. There’s only two sound slider options for effects and music. You’ll probably end up turning music off quickly because it is quite awful. That definitely could have used some more work. Rebindable keys with secondary buttons are here for every control as well. The game also supports multiple languages.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nI’ve been looking for a lighter train management experience like Train Valley for some time and their timing was lucky. The game looks cheap both mechanically and visually but it’s got a surprising amount of depth to keep the player engaged throughout the four chapters. Their asking price is right on the money in my opinion. Biggest issues I have with Train Valley are the music and sandbox mode. The music is awful, repetitive and not fun to listen to. The sandbox mode basically gives you unlimited resources to do whatever you want but there’s not a lot of flexibility to do anything crazy, so I don’t think you’ll use it much. For a bit of micromanagement fun to play every now and again, Train Valley works and plays well. The four chapters are challenging enough that you won’t blitz right through them and playing for the achievements will give you even more playtime. An enjoyable, if light, indie game.\n\nRead this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me]","November 7, 2015","true","15.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Cursing at Train Switches from 1830 to 2020.Genre: Indie Micromanagement Puzzle Game.\nDeveloped and Published by: Oroboro Games & Flazm.\nPlatform: Windows, MacOSX and Linux.\nBusiness Model: Base Game + Upcoming DLC\nCopy Purchased by Myself Read the full & unabridged review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]\n\nOverall Gameplay Thoughts\nTrain Valley, a quirky little title that got a surprising amount of press attention considering this is the publisher’s first game. Are we really that starved for train management styled games that anything that resembles one needs to be checked out? The answer is probably yes. The genre has been forever dominated by Open Train Tycoon, Train Tycoon Deluxe and the like for the past 20 years. Entries into the genre are far and few between, often lacking in quality. Here’s the thing, Train Valley isn’t a management game in the traditional sense. Not by a long shot. This is more of a puzzle game where the single objective is to figure out how to solve the level without running out of cash and subsequently going bankrupt. Everything else is a secondary concern.\n\nOn the surface, it looks like a simple micromanagement game and it is but there’s some mechanics woven in to make the experience more interesting. All you’ll be doing is deploying trains, building track and managing switches. During the level, trains need to be deployed and delivered to their destination station as soon as possible for a couple of reasons: each train has a money value, that’s rewarded to the player upon completion, which slowly deteriorates over time. Additionally, trains will launch automatically from the station after a certain amount of time. The only warning you’ll get is a five second notification before they launch. So, you need to make sure that stations are regularly deploying trains to prevent any accidents from occurring. This is made more complicated by the levels themselves which will spawn additional stations which need to be connected to the rest of the line and increasingly faster trains. Furthermore, there’s an in-game annual tax that you have to make sure to have money for. So, avoid being greedy or risk losing the level. Finally, as time passes, buildings will crop up over time that you may need to maneuver around or destroy (costing a lot of money).\n\nContent Thoughts\nThere are four chapters in total that are centered around a particular nation (or group of nations) that create the overall theme for each level and the trains you’ll see. This includes Europe, the United States, Russia and Japan. Over the course of each chapter, the levels will transition from the early 1830s to the modern age of 2020 while featuring a certain time era for that nation in the level. This changes what the trains look like as well. In terms of how it affects mechanics, the changing of time will increase the length of the trains and make them faster. For each chapter, there’s five challenge levels and one score attack level. Each challenge level also comes with the option to continue the level forever once you’ve finished it. For each level, there’s three optional goals you can try to shoot for and you don’t have to get all of them in one go. These goals can range from never wrecking a train, to gaining a certain amount of money to not allowing a train arrive at the wrong destination. They can be challenging to acquire, especially the gaining X amount of money, and may require several redos. I recommend trying to finish one of them during a level because they’ll add challenge to the levels and give them their own personality. It would have been nice if the achievements you had already completed were marked as such but it’s not a big deal. The score attack level is the culmination of the entire chapter. It plays the entire time period for the nation in one go from 1800s to 2000s while also doubling the in-game speed. This can be very tricky to deal with as it means taxes come twice as fast even though your trains stay at the same speed. Good luck on the Japan level, it’s brutally difficult.\n\nPC Settings\nSettings for Train Valley are decent, if limited. Video settings only include two sliders for resolutions and quality. You’ll probably run the quality at “fantastic” unless you’re trying to run this off a toaster. Resolution choices seem pretty good and it maxes out at the monitor’s resolution. The game has a cheap 3D look to it so it’s not like there’s any options missing. Fullscreen on/off and colorblind mode are included as well. There’s only two sound slider options for effects and music. You’ll probably end up turning music off quickly because it is quite awful. That definitely could have used some more work. Rebindable keys with secondary buttons are here for every control as well. The game also supports multiple languages.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nI’ve been looking for a lighter train management experience like Train Valley for some time and their timing was lucky. The game looks cheap both mechanically and visually but it’s got a surprising amount of depth to keep the player engaged throughout the four chapters. Their asking price is right on the money in my opinion. Biggest issues I have with Train Valley are the music and sandbox mode. The music is awful, repetitive and not fun to listen to. The sandbox mode basically gives you unlimited resources to do whatever you want but there’s not a lot of flexibility to do anything crazy, so I don’t think you’ll use it much. For a bit of micromanagement fun to play every now and again, Train Valley works and plays well. The four chapters are challenging enough that you won’t blitz right through them and playing for the achievements will give you even more playtime. An enjoyable, if light, indie game.\n\nRead this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me]","November 7, 2015","true","15.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Then you run trains, and where you can afford or have space to, extra trains.\n\nHowever, TV is not without issues.\n\n1. bankruptcy is common. 3K of tax annually cripples you if you've been building a lot or had a bad year for revenue.\n2. Beware the optionals - achieving them is harder than it looks.\n3. Russia is incredibly hard to conquer. Get some practice in.\n\nOverall, I'd rate the game at the moment a 8/10.

I have now spent several hours playing and would recommend this game to others.  That said, there are a few things which I would like to see added to the game.\n\nFirst, although the monetary value of each train tends to tell you something about the length of the train, I would like to be able to see a profile for each train before I release it from its station.  If I were to design the profile I would provide information regarding the total length of the train in number of cars.  Further, I would like to know the top speed of the locomotive so as to compare the top speeds of every locomotive currently waiting to be released from a station.  Added to that, it appears that most of the trains have the same top speed, despite the number of cars being pulled by the locomotive.  I know that there are a couple of different locomotives, but I do not know when a different locomotive is hitched to a load.  If the locomotive is random, I would like the profile to list its top speed under different loads.\n\nSecond, it appears that trains are ready to leave random stations at random times.  If this is indeed random, I would like a queue added which tells me in which order the waiting trains were introduced so as to help me decide which trains should be released in which order.  Further, trains do not stack in their railyards, so two trains cannot be waiting to be released at one time.  Instead, if another train is about to be added to a station, you receive a sudden five second warning and the first train is automatically relased.  If trains can only sit waiting to be released for a designated period of time, I would like to see a timer added into the queue so I know how much time is left before a train automatically disembarks.\n\nIf, however, trains are not random and a schedule truly does exist, I would like to have access to this schedule so I know when a train will be ready to leave a station, and where it needs to go.  It could even be the case that a single train could be required to visit multiple stations as opposed to a single station.\n\nI believe that these additions could both simplify and introduce difficulty as more planning is possible and required.","July 22, 2015","true","17.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Lay track strategically saving time and money or would you rather cut down trees to make it a strait shot for trains? or save money to work around them objects in your way?\n\nThe game is really well made even in the beta I haven't had any problems yet.
