Can't transfer progress from tablet to PC though.\n\nChicken Invaders is a series of shoot 'em up video games, you control a ship which needs to save the universe from the Chickens - Which had enough of you eating them all the time.\nWhile you play, you find a lot of different weapons, there's a weapon Level system too, when you defeat chickens, they sometimes drop a gift or energy orb - Getting the gift gives you a particular weapon, the orb raises your weapon level by +1.  The amount of weapons is massive, one is a railgun, another one is a electroshocker, and each one can be either good for particular enemies/bosses, or bad.\nYou don't switch weapons while you play, when you find a box, you can get it, and it replaces your current weapon. You can't switch back to it until you find another box with that weapon you want.\nEach wave is completely different, in one you see chickens moving in a clockwise way, in a different one they will be in shields which you need to destroy  - every single wave is different.\nThe storyline, it's really good and hilarious.\nSoundtrack - It's beautiful.\n\nIn other words, if you like space shooters, get this. It's not too hard, it's not too easy (Well there are 3 different difficulity levels) You'll very likely enjoy this game. I've been playing the series since I was a young kid, and I still love it. I'm even beta testing Chicken Invaders 5 now, because I want to help the game series, because it's simply amazing.\n10/10.\nIt's a space shooter for 5 bucks.","November 6, 2014","true","11.5"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","11","12","2","0"

'nuff said.\nThis game is legendary. I was like 5 years old, when I discovered Chicken Invaders. First game I have ever played. It was first episode of CI with poor graphics and strange controlls, but i frickin' loved it. I played only this game, nothing else.^^ I was super addicted to it. Later, CI2 came, also with christmas version, with lots of improvements 'n stuff. I learned my brother how to play it and we were having awesome fun. Biggest revolution came with CI3:ROTY and CI4:UO. Well, what to say about this game, intresting graphics, great multiplayer, controller support, unlockables, many weapons, levels are not stereothype, achievements(which are really easy, but ok:D) and also, game is not dead for devolpers. They are still anwsering your questions, helping fix the bugs'n stuff and I am so glad for them. Keep doing great job guys, and hope we will see Loco and CI3 on steam soon.\n\nSo, can you find better casual game than Chicken Invaders?\n-no.\n10/10, best casual game EVER.","June 11, 2014","true","7.6"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

If you have played the previous games, you already know everything about the game. The game has new weapons and unlockable content, obtainable through collecting keys. The unlockables range from purely cosmetic effects to adding a few addition atack types. This gives the game some replayability. This installment of the franchise also features online multiplayers, as previous only had local co-op.\n\nBut unfortunately, atleast for me, not enough has been changed from it's predecessors. If you have played previous titles before, you will get bored pretty quickly as the gameplay is identical most of the time. Also the game is pretty easy, which hurts the replay value. The game also does not have many achivements or challenges to test your skill and keep you interested. The only thing I have found to make the game harder is playing with a keyboard instead of a mouse, since keyboards lack the speed and precision mice offer, but that makes it less enjoyable.\n\nIn conclusion, for the price they have given the game is worth picking up, although I would love to see the franchise steer in the Rouge-like/Rouge-lite/PDS genre, with RPG elements. Personally I feel that the game will benefit a lot from the added depth from the PDS and RPG, which will make it a lot more interesting as well as add a lot of replayability.","June 25, 2014","true","5.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Although it is a rather short game, it contains some funny cutscenes, and destroying those chickens and get some fried chicken out of it made me a little happy.\n\nThe main character is not your average hero. All he cares about is fried chicken. He does not agree to help Hen Solo before he finds out that there will be no more fried chicken if he does not. This is but the beginning of a great adventure through a couple of galaxies.\n\nThe gameplay is rather straight-forward, as all you do is click to shoot and move your mouse to move. However, that does not make the game easy or boring. The fact that it has such simple mechanics makes it a great game to play if one ever feels a little bored and does not feel like playing a bigger game. The online feature did not work out that well (Unless, of course, it is just my laptop failing me as it usually does).\n\nAll in all, I would recommend this game.","June 21, 2014","true","6.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It looked like a colorful, simple game we could enjoy together. And for the most part it ix. But there are glaring oversights that withold my recommendations.\n\nMany of the graphical effects obscure important things like enemy projectiles. You will get killed and wonder what hit you, because a cloud of cosmetic smoke blocked your ability to see.\nSecond, there is no in game help, and with the number of collectibles it's very confusing to figure out what items you really need to be picking up. What do drumstricks/hamburgers do? Coins? How do I get more men? Why can I pick up some weapon upgrades but not others? What are these keys for? What are the stats of the weapons? How far can they be upgraded? etc.\nLastly, this version does not enable cheats. There are 5 lives and no continues. Once you're dead, you go back to the start. If the above were fixed I think it could be a lot of fun, but currently it isn't.","October 24, 2015","false","3.0"," 0 of 11 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","11","0","0"

This mechanic takes away every bit of fun there is in freely moving around the screen, and sometimes the game will assingn a SafeZone That just indicates that in the next wave you are chained to a different spot on the screen.\n\nNow let's talk about the enemies, they usually have a pre-determined pattern meaning that the challenge is reduced to just sitting at the bottom of the screen avoiding slow projectiles that some enemies eventually shoot. And now for the other type of enemy there is: The Bosses, the game compensates what it lacks of difficulty by transforming it into boredom, bosses aren't hard at all even in the hardest of difficulties the game compensates that by using a INSANELY HUGE unnecessary waiting time, you have to wait until the boss comes out of the bottom of the screen, you have to wait for the boss to finish its extremely predictable attack pattern, you have to wait until the boss locks you in place by simuntaneously throwing ♥♥♥♥ at you that you can't possibly see until the projectile is not being covered by the chickens, by doing that the game breaks the 2 of the 3 basic ♥♥♥♥ing rules of every space shooter.\n\n\n- It makes you wait for the long time that the enemy is "unattackable" not letting you shoot it.\n- It hides projectiles from you.\n\nAnd then there are unlockables, things that require an insane amount of key collecting to unlock all fo the relevant important ones. Sometimes a chicken will glow with a golden sparkle, meaning that upon dying, that chicken will drop a single key that let's you unlock stuff in the menu, BUT 40 KEYS TO UNLOCK A HARDER DIFFICULTY IN THE GAME IS JUST COMPLETE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T.\n\nTL;DR\n\n-The game lacks freedom from the player to roam around the screen\n-Enemies are predictable\n-Boss battle are boring\n-Too many Unlockables","December 21, 2014","false","4.2"," 3 of 47 people (6%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","6","3","47","4","0"
