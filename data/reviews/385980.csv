It's only saving grace is a guinea pig - but that guinea pig doesn't wheek OR eat it's own poop, which leads me to believe the developers have never actually seen a guinea pig.\n\nJokes aside...give this one a miss. Plenty of great games out there to spend your time on, so why bother with the mediocre?\n\nP. S. A cymbal crash plays each time you jump on an enemy. Since this is your main method of disposal, be prepared to get PTSD flashbacks whenever you're at band practice.","October 6, 2015","false","0.2"," 22 of 31 people (71%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","71","22","31","12","1"

There are far better choices available.\n\nThe protagonist in Scott in Space is a guinea pig who kills rhinos by jumping on their heads. The size difference alone makes this ridiculous, but the developers seem to have overlooked the rhinos main form of defence.\n\nFor some reason the screen fades to a complete white whenever a new area or level is entered, don't play this at night unless you want to be blinded every 5 minutes.\n\nThe one conversation I had with another character was poorly written and involved a dumb name gag which went on far too long.","September 23, 2015","false","0.4"," 16 of 28 people (57%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","57","16","28","6","0"

Granted, at the $5 price point, Oozi: Earth Adventure is a much better choice, and if you're willing to spend more Freedom Planet and Shovel Knight are arguably even better, but if you're like me and love platformers, but get frustrated with the punishingly difficult ones that are all the rage on Steam, you can never get enough of well made examples of the genre that just want to be accessible, and not non-stop reflex tests. This and Oozi are also great choices for kids who are just getting into gaming. As lovingly crafted as Freedom Planet and Shovel Knight are, they might be a little overwhelming for young ones.","October 2, 2015","true","1.7"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","9","15","0","0"

Doubtful.\nShould you buy this game? I see no reason why.\nWill I ask a refund? Well... The guinea pig is kinda cute.\n\nSeriously, this game is really, really bad. The only thing you have to do is to reach the end of a level, sometimes picking up a "quest" item on the road. There are ennemies in your way but it is far more efficient to dodge them all. Jumping on their heads indeed prove difficult and I have not figured at all what determines either you are hurt or you make a hit. Anyway, you have equal chance to die than to kill the guy, so on average, you are dead by the end of the level of you don't run away (but that's what a guinea pig is meant to do, right?).\n\nYou can also pick up apples along the way. A certain amount of them will resplenish your life. Otherwise, they are basically useless.\n\nLife is a pig problem. You have three bars of health and three lifes. I didn't quite get the difference between loosing a life and loosing them all (I re-started at the same point in both cases). As has been stressed in other reviews, once you have died, you will have to go throughout the game with only one life as the number of lifes remain at 0 until the end. This is pretty annoying. Knowing that a false jump (and, given the poor quality of the controls, you can bet you will do plenty) leading into a pit will make you instantly loose your one and only life, the game turns out to be incredibly difficult for nothing. Really bad.\n\nNoises may be awful -especially when you are hurt or when you fall. This is more annoying than you can think of.\n\nAre there any pros left? Not many. The main character is cute. The developpers seem to be involved. Actually it made me really sad and I have some pity for them. They seem to have tried to make a nice work with a nice guinea pig... And it just fails. Plainly.\n\n","May 11","false","0.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I think some people are too hard on it - it's a guinea pig in space, after all. Not a triple A title trying to compete with Fallout 4. You collect stuff and kill evil rhinos. No extra bells, whilstles or extra novel game mechanics. It's a pretty classic platformer of old; you control Scott the Guinea Pig Protagonist with walking, jumping and collecting apples.

In terms of plot, explicability of the events, gameplay, and general mien the game has, I'd compare it to SNES Mario. Hit detection can be a little off, and the writing is some of the worst I've seen, but, the gameplay and music make for a genuinely enjoyable experience. The only unforgivable aspect of this game is that there's NO direction on where to go. I'm completely stuck, right now; the game won't tell me what levels I've completed, or where I'm supposed to go, et cetera, so, I keep re-doing the same levels. I have no idea where to go from here. There's no reason for there not to be a "LEVEL COMPLETE" icon next to finished areas. PLEASE include that in future updates.\n\nOtherwise, it's just an enjoyable 2D platformer with suprisingly good music. Don't expect the plot or writing to bring you to tears, and a few aspects of the game may infuriate you for completely avoidable reasons, But, all in all, I've actually enjoyed playing the game, and keep coming back after I've cooled down from redoing the same level without knowing what to do.\n\nCheers!\n\n6.4/10","May 16","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
