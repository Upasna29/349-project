Movement seems a  little weird.  You shoot the bears to make them run away.  It crashed after second time I died. I guess it knew I was finished playing only after 11 minutes.  I doubt I'll play it again in it's current state.","April 23","false","0.2"," 40 of 55 people (73%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","73","40","55","6","0"

This isn't even an early access game its a full game.\n\nGood:\n\n1. 60 FPS\n2. Cheap Game\n3. Ok Graphics\n\nBad:\n\n1. Can't equip guns\n2. Can only pickup 7 items even though I clearly have 24 inventory slots.\n3. The character movement (W, A, S, D) is to quick like I have super speed.\n4. Small amount of options in menu (No sound settings)\n5. Invisible wall between a fence that I found that I could normally walk through.\n6. Picked up Tablet, but couldn't see it in inventory and no buttons would open it up.\n7. The blue stamina bar is too light its needs to be brighter, so we can see it.","April 23","false","0.3"," 30 of 42 people (71%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","71","30","42","4","1"

However, think of borrowing particular stuff from other popular games (rust comes first to my mind). What about building your own house and seeking for already-built houses which can have some supplies in there? I would also say multiplayer will aid the game. Think of different clashes between players to find supplies. What I am trying to say is that it would be great to have the multiplayer divided into 2 parts (liek you divided the singleplayer) - 1. People are fighting each others in order to find supplies, they build houses or just find places to lurk (if they ditched good shelter for stronger weapons) etc. 2. They are trying to survive from grizzlies invasion (and other animals' invasion?). By the way, if we are talking about NA it should be cool if you add easter eggs (whatever you come up with). Also, just try to push players to critical thinking and implications rather than just hectic decision making. Don't be afraid of backlash - try out myriad things and implement those which mesh with the game. Good luck\n\nP.S. fix the bear, 'cause it seems liek it is a sport car or smth ffs","April 26","true","0.2"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

I must note I wanted this game when I fist saw it on steam and it wasn't released yet so everything looked like a game ive been waiting for.\nCon Flaws: I start every game with the revolver, 18 rounds, flashlight, baking powder, and tablet. No save so everytime i get touched by the griz he insta kills me and i have to redo the same gathering faze which having been killed quicker than it takes me to gather inventory has made me really hate the gathering part.\nCon Flaw: The Griz has horrible hitboxes where you can actually get a shot to make him run away. I found following in back of the bear shooting his ♥♥♥ or side to be the only effective hit spots that work. The head is just a waste of ammo.\nPro Flaw: One of the only things that the player can use to his advantage is going into a building, The griz will not come in and will just circle the building making the annoying growl/howl like a dog sound. I let him pass the entrance and for fun just follow him untill he notices me and then i shoot him and go to another building.\nCon Flaw: Why is it that everytime I get near a building the Griz magically appears, Seems like bad scripts to me. I have yet to have a bear act up on me untill I am within sight of my new building. Then I have to sprint to the building and hide until he passes my exit.\nAlso do not try to shoot the griz when you are in what I call the comfort zone (in or too close to certain buildings that the griz will or shall i say is programmed not to come near.) The only shots that can hit the Griz must be out of comfort zone and in some cases far away from buildings.\nAll in all I dont knock games for flaws. I will still play Griz project just due to the difficulty it has atm. I also like seeing the dev using unity as there engine because thats what Ive been using, I dont feel this is a cash grab but the devs definatly have more faith in there creation than I can put out for mine so I have respect for that. I fear creating another knock off of a game and have put several month's just into my story line not including classing up on and matching unity and others into a growing nightmare of a game from the mind of an 80's kid.","May 2","true","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You're thrown into a situation where if you didn't pick up the map device, you're ♥♥♥♥ed. A bear attacks from the left, middle or right and if you didn't pick up a gun he gets you within the first 30 seconds. None of the situation is explain to you and it takes about 2-3 bears per distance travelled between each point. <Rifle is useless because of lack of ammo.\nOverall; 1/10.","May 2","false","0.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

The fix I found for this was deleting the save files and redownloading the game.\nOnce you get in the game, you're in a house, you gather supplies to go out to look for car batteries in a forest full of deadly bears that don't give a pickle about your bullets, If it were me, I'd go to a walmart instead, despite it being about the same amount of dangerous, I'd just run in circles drinking cokes to get away from the lady on the motorised scooter.\n\nOh look, a bear. *ded*\n\nI didn't explore the whole map, because the bears were not very happy with me trying to take their car batteries, but what I did see was a bunch of empty buildings with nothing in them, oh yeah and one building with a table that had a radio on it, and that was about the most exciting thing that happened.\nYou can sprint for about 3 seconds and then you're tired, so you gotta chug 10 cans of coke so you can run 2 feet.\nI'm quite certain If I saw a grizzly bear, I'd make a mess in my pants and then run until my lungs imploded and created a black hole.\n\nReally can't recommend this game as there's nothing to do besides running around hiding from ninja bears.\n\nIt's pretty much the same concept as slender man, which hasn't been overused at all, right?\nOh, but you get to pick items that will prove to be completely useless.","April 27","false","0.5"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","41","7","17","4","0"
