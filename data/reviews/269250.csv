My heart after playing this game. This is coming from a man who has watched & played multiple Urobochi works.\n\nThe story is about a kid who is attempting to enact his dream - to explore Mars - through rapid accumulation of wealth utilizing the stock market. At age 16 he ran away from home, earned 1,000 mools (appears to have 1/1 exchange rate with USD) working, then multiplied it to 72,000 mools through margin trading.\n\nWhile starting off slow - perhaps even painfully so, the story moves towards a powerful, deeply moving (and terrible) conclusion. I don't want to spoil more, so I'll end by saying World's End Economica (in Volume 1, at least) is the definition of the Linear VN archtype, unlike Fate/Stay Night you don't even get to make choices.\n\nFor those who want some action in their VN, Sunrider (a free game, and on Steam) plays very much like Fire Emblem with a dash of Mass Effect style morality choices.\n\nAlthough I am recommending World's End Economica, it is emotionally traumatizing. Definitely not for everyone.","October 23, 2014","true","4.9"," 133 of 142 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","133","142","2","4"

Spoiler of episode 01 is not guaranteed. This review is written from my experience playing the first English version of the game and after a quick technical test of the Steam version.\n\nQuick story summary: In the far future, the Moon has been conquered and turned into a self-sustained colony. It quickly gathered wealth and became a capitalist haven. Haru/Hal wants to get rich quick in this Luna colony, so he does so by gaming the system through stock market trading, Episode 01 of this game follows his teenage years, accumulating his first successes at stock trading.\n\nMy view: The premise may make you think this story is gonna be like a boring Wall Street Journal article, but it really is not. This is really a drama. The game spends a lot more time with the relationships between Hal and the people around him, how they live their poor lives outside the center of wealth of the world, how capitalism affect their lives, how the pressure of a materialistic society pushes them into dark corners, and how the dream to get rich made Hal cynical of his circumstance. This is less Capitalism: A Love Story and more Wall Street (the Oliver Stone movie).\n\nI like the character development a lot, although the game takes its time to play this out. I like the relationship between Hal and Hagana, they started out with a misunderstanding (to the point of physical violence) and remained hostile toward each other in the first part of the game. But as it goes along, both of them slowly softens up to each other, and it's pleasant to see this gradual shift in their relationship. I like how beneath the surface, our protagonist is not really greedy as the capitalist bosses that he resents so much. He actually has a noble purpose by getting rich which is revealed in the last part of episode 01. To many, money is their goal, to Hal, money is a tool to serve his higher purpose. I like Lisa and how she acted like a mother/older sister figure to the protagonist. I even like the money lender Toyama in this game, the game portrayed him as less of an one-dimensional loan shark, and more as just another victim of capitalism.\n\nAnother thing this game really succeeded at is how it engages you into stock market trading, which should have been dry and boring. Even if you don't understand any financial terms, the game explained all of them  in a layman's language, from the basic terms to advanced trading and analyzing technique. And it goes really deep, explaining how the market is influenced, how the stock numbers form a pattern and how the common mentality is taken advantage of (the mentality to always bid at 10-rounded price marks, for instance). This game made me really get it, that thrill of trading stocks and taking risks that might give a big payoff. This is why people are obsessed with stock trading, I really get it now.\n\nYet despite indulging in the stock market theme, this game does not glamorize it. This is ultimately a cynical social commentary about capitalism. We have all seen this before in real life. The stock market ruins as much lives as the lives it paid off big. In this game, it ruins not only lives, but relationships as well. Without spoiling the specifics, episode 01 ends on a bitter note, prompting the next phase in Hal's life in his adult years in episode 02.\n\nGraphics: The game runs in glorious 720p resolution by default, but you can resize the the window of the game on smaller screens. As a result, art assets in the game are made in native 1280x720 resolution. The backgrounds benefit from this the most. They look gorgeous, especially the views of Newton City, it's as much of a sight to behold as the narrative described it to be. There is not much variety in the scenes so you will end up getting the same backgrounds a lot of time, but considering this is an independent game, it's still quite impressive. The character sprites look okay if a bit lacking in poses, but they have some weird pencil sketch lines on their neck shadows. If you're bothered by this, do be noted that episode 02 onward no longer have these weird pencil sketches.\n\nAudio: There is no voice acting. The soundtrack have some scifi bleeps mixed in here and there. For the rest of the time, they are mostly calming and not very memorable.\n\nTechnical report: I'll be commenting on technical aspects of this particular version in this segment. This is the 2nd English version of the game. And here are the differences:\n- Config menu and pop-up messages in the first English version was in Japanese. The whole interface is now in English.\n- The game now allows you to pick a much wider range of text font. The default font (Times New Roman) looks quite unpleasant. I recommend  the font Flamenco for this game, it looks really nice.\n- The original version had some game crashing bugs that occur when you open the About window or try to play a track in the music mode. Also, the gallery and the music mode are bugged in the original version (no images and tracks unlocked when you finished the game). All of these bugs have been fixed in this version.\n- A slightly new translation. I can't comment on the translation quality, but I can only hope it would be better then the first English script. My experience of the game was from before it received a translation patch and an edit pass by sekaiproject.\nAlso do note that the game is bilingual. The original Japanese script is included, a great resource for language students.\n\nEarly Access status: Steam integration is incomplete. Steam overlay is not working in windowed mode right now and features like Screenshot is not working either.\nRelease version status: Not much different from the Early Access version. The same issues are still here and the game still uses the same engine. A bit disappointing, but at least the meat of the game is still intact.\n\nI hope my review helps you making a decision whether to purchase this game.","May 5, 2014","true","4.7"," 110 of 129 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","110","129","0","4"

Is a visual novel. And by that, the type of linear, no-choice novel. It is by all practical means a book. A digital book with music and linear storyline.\nIf you thought you'd get to play your hands on the stock exchange, or remembering the words:\n"The first rule: Never take a loss.\nThe second rule: Never forget the first."\nThen you'll be disappointed, there are no "Choices" for you to make.\n\nSo why do I recommend this?\n\nStory - In keeping with Hasekura's arguably more famous work of Spice and Wolf which is a series of books and manga I wholeheartedly would recommend to you, the reader. It's as it says on the tin, about economy.\nBut in all the numbers and logics, there's a story. And what a story! It's in this sense, not a game. It is a story, a well-built story with its natural plot twists and moments where you'd want to cheer, and moments you'd be stuck in a well of sympathy or spite depending on your own evaluation.\n\nMusic - It's got music, and to me i do feel it quite surely fits to the whole setting. Sound really makes a scene deeper, if the music is quite right. This one Is just that. Quite right.\n\nGraphics and visuals - As to be expected, there's CGI's which themselves are quite well made. The general playing scenes might be described as if ever so slightly bland. Stemming from the fact that the characters themselves seem a bit bereft of emotions for reasons i'll let you discover yourselves.\nIt is a book, and a quite fine book.\nBut as a game, no it's not so much a game, there's no interaction you do as the "player" You are the reader, so in this sense, advertising as a game might be misleading. But nontheless. I do recommend this game to you all, for those rainy days when you'd get a headache playing RTS or FPS games, don't feel like going outside, and just want to sit back and, read something.

Make no mistake though, it’s aimed at a tiny audience. The protagonist is a stock investor, and the writer went out of his way to make it authentic. It’s to the point where I imagine sections of the story will be impenetrable for those who haven’t read a course or two of economics. Terms like “short selling” are used without more than the briefest explanation.\n\nIt does a good job of portraying not just the appeal of the stock market, but also the absurdity, and the risks involved with it. Folks with modest aspirations have their dreams smashed by people in ivory towers, who view the economy as a game. The story conveys how stock trade happens, without dumbing it down in any way. Here’s where I think it’ll lose much of the audience. At the same time the story attempts to create a human connection to the people on the street. Those who just live their lives, making a meager wage, who have to go into debt just to pay for education and healthcare. It walked a precarious balance here. The two parts worked for me, but I’ve seen reviews that don’t agree at all. It revels in trading with such detail, that I can see all attachment being lost with many in the audience.\n\nWhen I saw this was “Episode 1” I expected it to be 3-4 hours long or something. But instead it was around 8 hours long. It’s a complete story arc which stands on its own legs. I played it all in a single sitting without feeling the need to stop, which I can only take as a good sign. All the various story threads have good pay-offs in the end, and I felt the tug of wanting to see what happens next. My only problems with it were in the production values. The backgrounds were outstanding, and the music was good. But the engine was behaving strangely. The UI is way too big, and it often looped music incorrectly, and many image transitions were messed up. Apparently this was ported from one engine to another to allow cross platform support. Wouldn’t surprise me if this is the culprit, and that nobody has the will to patch it, as I’d guess it’s at least a hundred little polish problems littered across the game. These polishing issues didn’t ruin it for me or anything.\n\nI’m impressed at the effort the author put into this. This was not aimed at a general audience. It’s definitely one of those stories that was written with no regard to mass market appeal at all. And that’s what makes it work! I’m kind of amazed it was made at all.","January 27, 2015","true","8.3"," 48 of 52 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","48","52","0","2"

In true Spice and Wolf fashion, it's a bit heavy on the technical jargon; prepare to be confused if you don't know much about the stock market and investing, though this is not by a lack of effort on the novel's part to teach you, at it does touch at least on the basics.\n\nClocks in at around 13 hours depending on how fast you read, it definitely doesn't overstay its welcome. Solid sci-fi human-colonies-on-the-moon setting, with interesting characters that unfortunately don't have enough time to be developed fully. The music score is solid for the most part, with special notion to the catchy main menu tune, Under the Net.\n\nFantastic ending, fitting for the end of the first episode of a trilogy.

I was not sure how long it would be and if the story will end or just leave me hanging for a sequel that might or might not ever happen (been there, done that in the past).\n\nHowever, I ended up buying it because of steam sales and oh boy was I wrong. Why did I not play this before?\nThe story is great, the artwork is amazing (aside for some secondary areas and backgrounds). This is not a "choose your own story" visual novel with multiple choices and paths, this is just a story. Do you like reading books? Do you like getting immersed in good stories? Then you will like this.\n\nDo you play dating sims and visual novels with "routes" and choices? Do you just want some h-scenes? Then I'm sorry this is probably not to your linking.\n\nThe story is long enough to keep you entertained  (I clocked 13-14 hours), it is very interesting and at times not so easy to follow so it will require your attention most of the time. If you think you might not like economics and stock trading... well, you might be surprised because this story really makes you want to get more into it. I myself do not really enjoy stock trading but this story almost made me want to get out of my way try my hand at being an investor,it really is that interesting.\n\nThe ending fits well with the story and provides somewhat of a closure so you won't be left hanging in the middle of the plot only to be told "yo sorry, go buy the other episodes". Without spoiling anything, it leaves enough space for the following episodes, but at the same time you will feel content with what you have. Just like reading a good book of a trilogy, so do not be afraid to give this game a go. It is totally worth the money in my opinion.","November 29, 2014","true","15.1"," 38 of 41 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","38","41","0","0"

It's about a guy who is very good at stock trades, who lives in more future time than we, when humanity achieved fully reaching the Moon and even made city there that uses Solar power with Solar Panels to maintain itself, and it located inside a dome where even rain is simulated, so there lives our protagonist.\n\nThis VN is written by Isuna Hasekura the writer of Spice & Wolf series, there is even anime and manga of it besides more than 11 books. Because of this you can see World End Economica is written more professionally than other VNs, she describes small details very well, engages different moments with explanations of secondary things that gives a more deep feel to the story, characters and the surrounding world of the City in the Moon, I also really like the characters personality, the Moon and their citizens and different places there are described in multiple details making you feel more the world of the story.\n\nI totally recommend getting World End Economica, if you like VNs with good more serious stories where even the anime style is a secondary thing, anime style is nice it gives characters their personality and look, but it doesn't really affect the actual story, so even if you are not into anime you would probably still like it, Isuna Hasekura is a really good writer, she won't disappoint you.","November 24, 2015","true","11.5"," 42 of 48 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","42","48","3","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DoctorTeo/recommended/269250/","DoctorTeo","Doctor Teo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DoctorTeo/","613 products in account","World End Economica is a visual novel, plain and simple. As a visual novel of the "Kinetic" variety, there are no decisions to make or actions to take; it is more accurate to think of WEE as a book rather than a game. It could take a fast reader at least ~8 hours to get through it all.\n\nThough the novel is appropriate for younger audiences, there are economic concepts which may be more suitable for those in the young adult range. All in all, it is a novel appropriate for a wide range of ages, and I would recommend it for anyone who wants some light sci-fi to pass the time.\n\nThe strength of the novel lies in being both simple and complex when it needs to be. With a small cast of characters involved, it's easy to keep track of them all, and all characters feel like they're a significant part of the story. This might not be a story with spells or lasers, but the author certainly does not dissapoint when it comes to assigning high stakes. Explaining further may ruin parts of the story, but allow this reviewer to at least say this: anyone who reads this to the end will be begging for the next episodes (which are currently being translated).\n\nA few Engrish errors happen on a rare occasion, but not enough to ruin the story. Whether you be a new reader curious of what Visual Novels are all about, or for an avid reader looking for some light reading, WEE is an enjoyable experience for many.\n\nOne concern: as is the case with nearly all visual novels, this book isn't for anyone who doesn't like anime-esque visuals, and much older audiences may have trouble enjoying this book. Other than that, it's a good ~10 hours of well written sci-fi/economics that makes one yearn for more.","February 27, 2015","true","10.7"," 31 of 34 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","31","34","0","0"

My very first visual novel. The very thought of it coming from the author of some renown, and music from group that's been doing some Touhou remixes made me think that it is fine specimen to introduce mine self to the wonderful world of visual novels.\n\nIt is a nice story with some merit to it, but not without faults.  For instance there are some very fascinating dialogue with such a vivid scenery as empty  black screen and some of the ... hmmh, translation choices seemed bit awkward and even coarse. I do want to believe that it is the handiwork of the translator(s), and not the intended meaning of the author.\n\nHowever my greatest problem was with how the author presents the market. By the time I'm writing this I've been investing in a real market for well over 5 years. So most of the time when I am reading the protagonist going on about the market it made me want to slap him and yell " this is not how a real market works!". If things really worked like they are presented in the game I would be owner of the stock market in few years. But someone might argue that it's fictional market, so fictional rules apply. I'd say they are correct in that regard. However I was under impression that they were trying to make a serious financial "thriller" in sci-fi context.\n\nOh and lest we forget the juvenile approach with panty shots and whatnot.\n\nPut those little jagged edges of literature aside. The art is guaranteed nice. I came for the market  based story and stayed for the emo-tional drama.

It is pretty long considering how it is just a third of the full story. It is written by the same author who wrote Spice and Wolf. I would recommend having a basic knowledge of stocks and margin trading to fully enjoy the story, since most of the exciting parts are about stock trading.\n\nStory: The story is well written. It is about a boy who runs away from home and makes a living by trading stocks. At times, I feel the story really dragged on, and could be condensed. I really liked the twist at the end. I have studied a lot of economics, finance, statistics, mathematics and computer science, so I thought the story was pretty amazing since it incorporated a lot of material I had learned into a plot. But without basic knowledge of stocks or an interest in economics, you probably will not undestand or be interested in the most exciting parts of the plot and the plot is pretty dull without those components. Overall I would rate the plot 8.5/10.\n\nCharacters: The characters differed from the stereotypical characters in most Anime/VN and were well developed. Nothing too special about them though. I would rate the characters 7/10\n\nMusic: The music was okay. Better than a lot of other games. A few catchy tunes. I would rate it 7.5/10.\n\nArtwork: The artwork was nice.

Cool concept, poor execution - I wouldn't buy it if it's not on sale.\n\nFull review:\nIf I had to describe this visual novel in one word, I'd call it amateurish. There were several typos and mispellings, along with duplicate lines due to poor coding (all instances of which I screenshotted to send to the devs). If I paid ~$10 for a game, I'd expect at least some standard of professionalism.\n\nEDIT:\nAccording to this announcement, the game has been properly TLCed and edited two months after this review was originally written. Obviously, I'm not going to read through the entire game again, so I can't say whether or not the aforementioned issues have been remedied completely, but at the very least, it should be better. Regardless, the rest of my review stands. /edit\n\nTo be fair, it was originally in Japanese and I can only assume it was translated to English afterwards, possibly in preparation for the Steam release, since the English version came out two years after. However, a lot of fan translations I've played - koestl's Grisaia no Kajitsu translation, for example - were flawless. A paid translation like this pales in comparison, and if I ever feel up to it, I'll play through in Japanese to see if the game is up to scratch in that department.\n\nAs for the contents of the game itself, it's extremely dull. The writing style was extremely unprofessional - again, this may be attributed to it being a translation, though I can provide several examples of brilliant translations. The premise was interesting, which was what led me to vote for WEE to be greenlit, but I can't say I'm not disappointed. The story was uninspired and predictable, and although the concept had a lot of potential, the writer didn't really pull it off that well - I found myself bored several times while reading, and I only kept going because I was expecting something interesting to come up (nothing did). The peaks and troughs were in all the wrong places, with little to no transitions, and was uncomfortable to read.\n\nAnother point of concern is the fact that it's a kinetic novel. I can appreciate the style of a kinetic novel and enjoy it as anyone would, but why would there be three pages of save slots for a visual novel with no decisions? The game could've been far better constructed to allow the player to influence Hal's (who I would've much rather been named Haru in English, in accordance to his Japanese name ハル) decisions regarding which stocks to buy, how to respond to other characters and whatnot. Of course, I'm not asking for a full-fledged stock market simulation, but just allowing the user to decide whether or not Haru should follow through with a commitment and giving more than one disappointing ending would've made the game a lot more enjoyable.\n\nWhile on the topic of saving though, I do recommend anyone about to start the game to set aside about 10 hours and finish the game in one go. The way the story is written, without being divided into chapters or scenes, and without any real breaks or transitions, makes it extremely difficult to find a place to save and stop for the day. Unfortunately, I wasn't aware of this and spread the game across two days, and it made for a rather interrupted experience.\n\nThe artwork was generally quite nice, but I think I only saw a total of around 5-6 backgrounds and about that number of different sprites, which doesn't really cut it for me and the OST was also nothing really to write home about. The main issue here is the lack of content. For a game at this price, you'd expect the artist(s) and composer(s) to put in a bit more work, but a lot of the time, there was no soundtrack playing, and the screen was simply black with a text box over it. In this sense, I honestly don't feel like the game was worth the money I spent on it.\n\nThere are no real redeeming points to WORLD END ECONOMiCA - pretty much every aspect of the visual novel is subpar in comparison to most other visual novels. I don't believe my score of 4/10 to be particularly harsh or generous, and if we interperet the ten point scoring system properly, with 5/10 meaning average and not garbage, then I think 4/10 is quite reasonable.

Our young male protagonist has run away from home and is trying to make it big in the stock market (on the moon, of course). Unlike other young male protagonists, he actually knows some stuff about the stock market and is doing alright for himself. However, after a close encounter with the police, he takes refuge with a young woman who is also caring for a girl about his age.\n\nPros:\n\n+Great story, even with the esoteric vocabulary (in general, it's explained well)\n+Good length, especially if you read out loud (You could probably do it in 15-20 if you're focused)\n+Great art: all of the art is well drawn and the characters' looks suit them well (you'll find no exaggerated anatomy here)\n+Dat OP\n+Lots of feels\n\nCons:\n\n-Minor typos usually do not detract from understanding but somewhat ruin immersion\n-The descriptions given in the story do not always match the illustrations (HER EYES ARE RED JFC)\n-Lots of feels\n\nAbout the feels though, I think my partner said it best "Some stories tell you the story you want to hear. Others tell you what actually happened. This is a story about what actually happened."\n\nOverall: 9/10 please release the rest of them.","June 5, 2015","true","23.3"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

What I did not expect was a fascinating look into the meaning of human relationships in a world where the core tenets of Neoliberal governmentality are so entrenched as to resemble natural law more than social construct. It is, in a way, a vivisection of the Homo Economicus of economic fairy tales (the sort of man who, when asked to pass the salt, would respond with "What's in it for me?"); protagonist Hal's growth is the focus of the story, as is the intersection of market rationality and human struggle which provides the dramatic force behind the plot.\n\nThe characters are good, though some suffer from limited development throughout the course of the story - something that I expect may be rectified in future episodes.  The most glaring flaw of this VN lies in the 'visual' half of visual novel - CGs are scarce, sometimes used inappropriately, and the backgrounds are passable at best; likewise, there are numerous audio issues, ranging from inappropriate scoring in some parts to frequent and sudden cuts in the music.\n\nNonetheless, the flaws don't detract much from the experience, and overall, I've got to hand it to Hasekura-sensei, because this is a story that is highly relevant to the modern day, in the wake of the Great Recession, the Foreclosure Crisis and several decades of Neoliberal government. I highly recommend it to any political economy/anime nerds, and anyone else for that matter.","January 20, 2015","true","9.0"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

For those fascinated in these topics the game is an entertaining take on it and a decent intro primer you can take some information from. The character I see in a lot of negative reviews is has character flaws many readers aren't willing to put up with but I find such characters to be refreshing in that they are so convicing in their written convictions that to invoke an emotional response be it disgust is powerful. You absolutely want to loathe the protagonist but his character growth turns him into a likeable person much different from the brash childish character he is in the beginning. There are a couple odd quirks in how the music loops and the CG stutters in some transitions but nothing particularly irritating enough to make you stop reading.

This is an advanced read and I learned a lot from it -- not just in terms of vocabulary, but also in how the stock market works. Told from the perspective of a runaway sixteen-year-old, everything was thoughtfully described like any Hasekura work, while maintaining the spunky additude of a male adelecent. And the stakes in the story? I think there are moments when WORLD END ECONOMiCA is equally humerous and even more thrilling than Hasekura's other series: Spice & Wolf. In short, the story itself is solid.\n\nThe two, maybe three, main characters are complex, some of the secondary characters could use a little more exposition, but I'm hopeful in the sequels to come. The music selections are very appropriate for each moment with a few particularly memorable tracks. The character sprites are decent, some better than others, the CGs are even better even though some are re-used in the story.\n\nThe complaints I have could possibly be linked to the switch to the Ren'Py engine in such a rush. In my Mac version of the game (Ren'Py was used to accomodate Mac and Linux), there were moments throughout when coding issues thew me out of the loop of the story. Lots of extra/missing quotation marks or periods, sentences that were chopped between one too many frames, missing nameplates when characters are talking, etc. Every song in the game had looping issues where it would play about 10 seconds into the loop and then jump back to the beginning again. The most heinous mistakes were when the character sprite was supposed to make a slight shudder or a nod and it ends up jumping around the screen sporadically. It was so bad that when a sprite actually made a reasonable movement, it made me sigh in relief, still removing me from the story.\n\nIn summary, WORLD END ECONOMiCA was a fantastically written story by Hasekura that is pleasing to the ear, the eye, and the mind, but the number of glitches throughout the game is criminal when coupled with a wonderful tale. I have e-mailed screenshots of all of the glitches I caught to their support group, and I hope they take the time to fix them in the future. If they ever do fix them that will restore a point or two in my rating, but for now, I anxiously await the next installment at the end of the year.\n\nMy score for WORLD END ECONOMiCA by Isuna Hasekura: 7.5/10\n\n","November 27, 2014","true","24.3"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","0"

The only little complaint that I have is that sometimes during the narration, the BG/sprites are not there… It’s a black screen. I don’t know if that was the author’s intention, but I thought that kinda “broke” the climax during certain parts. Despite that, it’s a wonderful work totally worth paying the full price since it’s quite of a long story for a kinetic VN.

He takes up residence with an energetic Church caretaker, Lisa, and another young, enigmatic runaway girl known as Hagana, who is a socially awkward math prodigy trying to scrape by. While he tries to keep his investing life a secret from his guardian and cohabitant, a series of setbacks in the Church forces his hand, and the stakes of his investing ultimately ramp up to encompass more than his long term ambitions of earning enough money to fund his space exploration where no other human has gone before.\n\nIt is especially refreshing that it features such a great cast of fundamentally flawed characters against the backdrop of poverty, which is relatable even with the context of the futuristic Moon colony setting. While this first episode presents a complete ~8-10 hour storyline with a proper(? some will argue against it, but I think it's appropriate for a 3-part series) episode resolution, the next two episodes are currently being Kickstarted (and it's already well over the original $22k goal and may even get enough funding for a Vita release; WEE -complete- Kickstarter ends 9 Jul 2014); I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good drama of a VN read, and for the greatest deal I'd recommend you pledge to the Kickstarter for the -complete- (all 3 episodes) for a lump sum pledge of $20 via the Kickstarter at https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sekaiproject/world-end-economica-complete to get the best deal on all 3 episodes.\n\nIt appears the next 2 episodes are slated for a Spring 2015 release.

The whole society on the moon is well fleshed out and the transitions between world building and plot development were fairly well done.

All the characters have their stories and the way the main character learns about them feels smooth. Each character has a depth to their personality and it made me really empathise with them. I also enjoyed the development of relationships between the main character and the other characters.\nHowever, this visual novel doesn't have any choices that deviates the story and although the stock market explanations were interesting initially. The main gripe I have is that the quantity of art didn't meet the quantity of the story so at times where I was expecting a visual to accompany the story there was simply a black screen.

No gameplay at all. If you were looking for action or plot twists, look away, you will be reading a lot.\n\nRating - 8/10\nOther - 5/10\n\n___________\n\nGraphics:\nGrahpics are okish, capped normally at 1024 x 600 and fullscreened with little damage to the image of the storyplay.

Just click spam or right click to see the image, scroll button does something too, such as text history. No story reversal such as in Sunraider or other similar VNs however.\n\nRating 8/10\n\n___________\n\nBugs/Glitches:\n\nDespite being on Early Acess for about 4 months, they had several bugs on their story. Sometimes I will notice that a room was not painted dark but a filter was doing it, how did I know? Because the filter was misalined and so I saw that the regular room was underneath. Several english typos are seen throught the story, I didn't take pictures and report those typos because I was reading AND steam photo taker barely works(and when it does, it only works on the main screen). Some other bugs include repetition of entire sentences, it becomes more evident at the end of the story when Hal repeats some sentences over and over meaninglessly.\n\n____________\n\nStory:\n\nGoing down to the story (no spoilers I promise), Hal is a enterperneur trying to strike it rich in the stockmarket bussiness. While this does follow the theme of S&W of economy, the economy in WEE is much more larger than it would have been on S&W, which makes it diffrent than it. Story telling is engaging at times, but sometimes it can get very depressingly slow or anguishing at Hal's faliures.\n\n__________\n\nThe ending of WEE is indiffrent for me, I didn't like it, I don't say I like it, its more of an attempt to make it better on Ep.2, perhaps it could have ended diffrently but thats how it was made. The story going more or less reading can take from 20 hours to 10 hours. I have 30 hours because I used to leave the game on for some particular soundtracks, not that many that memorable however.\n\nI would probably had wished it had taken a route such as S&W, however it seems it won't be like that. I would probably buy Ep.2 to satisfy craving but meh.\n\nRating 7/10\nOther 6/10\n\nThanks for reading these otherwise useless pixels and bytes.

Good artwork all around.\n\nI was finish in 11 hours so expect a similar amount of story with a slightly faster default autoplay speed.\n\nIt does however have a somewhat draggy opening. About 3ish hours is spent with the characters and world building (which may be good or bad per person.

The author clearly knows what he is talking about when he wrote this VN. However, if one is not very financially literate, the VN will be a bit of a challenge to understand. Considering that I am a finance major and know about stocks and how the market works, I understood everything that was happening in this VN. In fact, I can say that the VN made the stock market look way TOO simple compared to the way it is actually. Futhermore, there was some nice references that some people would have caught. For example, Daniel Trap who bought a tower in Manhattan who had gone bankrupt 3 times... HMMMMM Also Carlyle Group is an actual company although in the VN it was Carlyle Investments. One other thing was that the stock market in the VN followed the Japanese market time from 9-5 instead of the US one from 9:30-4. Finally, the ending of the VN really laid the cold truth out there and I really enjoyed that realistically because before that, it just seemed like the stock market was a place where people can profit easily. But those detail aside, the VN presented a nice thought stimulating experience, especially for someone like me who is interested in the field.\n\nAside from the good parts of this VN, I thought the character development was a bit shallow to say the least. Some of the parts seemed a bit forced and the connection was surface level from one to another. Although you can see the growth in the character relations, I still felt like it came too sudden and sometimes too unexplained. That is one of the main reasons why I'd choose Spice and Wolf over World End Economica, because in Spice and Wolf, the character development was amazing.\n\nOverall, definitely worth playing/reading this VN because it is really good. I look forward to better character development in episode 2 and 3 and for an amazing conclusion!\n\nRating: 8.4/10\nRecommend: $5 or under","May 8","true","18.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","0"

And surprisingly enough - it was a decently done story. Featuring a protagonist full with ambition who is faced with the real world as he meets people and some likeable characters none of which really seemed to fill the cliches that VNs tend to have. The best part of this was the economics of it all (although in real world sentiment isn't really that romantic) and some really good explanations given by the author. There are no choices - it's a linear story and it's not voiced, so if you like flashy VNs, this might not be to your liking. The story itself isn't too long, max 8, maybe 10 hours for slow readers (I left the game open during the day, alright?), so if you feel like it's not worth the full price I wouldn't blame you, although I feel like it's worth supporting the people behind the translation and ultimately, the people who made it.

Cannot recommend enough.\n\nAs a whole, the story takes a long time to get going, but if you have the patience for its pacing, it will pay off immensely and you are definitely getting bang for your buck (especially if you pick this up on sale). It takes its time with setting up; World building is fantastically done and used to its benefit. The characters with the most screentime are multifaceted, engaging, play well off each other, and carry a variety of emotions.\n\nIf you're skeptical on how talk about economics and stock trading is integrated into the story, don't be. For the most part, explanations are fluid, interesting, engage well with the story, and feeds off high-intensity trading sessions and highly-competitive showdowns between buyers and sellers. The intensity is gripping and it makes for a story that can be funny, exhilerating, tragic, and intimate. A great OST punctuates these moments very well.\n\nI can nitpick where it falls short in general multimedia presentation (poor music looping, at times lazy use of CGs, too many black screens and not enough visual depictions of, well, graphs), but for a VN you are staying for the story and the strength of its writing. And I would be hardpressed to name VNs on Steam that can top it in that department.\n\nIf you care at all about VNs, this is a must have for your steam library.

Its a nice VN so far id say. Lots of detail and charecter development is nice, there isnt the rushed sequences that people try to do to speed scenes up which is very nice. Art work is very good I must say I really like that.\n\nSetting: You are a kid that dropped out of school in order to get money in the stock market, but you are on the moon. The story focuses a lot on referencing between the Moon and the Earth, kinda gives you an idea of what Earth must be like for someone that has never been on it. This isnt a nice world, its hostile and there are blatent problems occuring, but bad i dont mean explosions, death and watermelons but this kid has to survive on next to nothing. While he has a foothold in the stock market he cant just go to a bank and ask to withdraw a few thousand pounds.\n\nYou meet various charecters and their personalities are well sorted out, they are developed enough, not too much making it silly or forced but the charecter notices the kinda thing you would likely notice whether you want to or if you see something on someone without realising.\n\nI'll recommend it as it is rather interesting, the start is a little dragged on, things start to pick up once you are in the sewers\n\nspoiler alert: dumbledore dies.","March 27, 2015","true","10.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","3","4","2","0"

The translation is amateurish and practically unreadable in some places. There are rampant misspellings, grammatical errors, and tons of overly literal translations with no regard toward how people actually speak in English. It's very clearly a novel translated to English from Japanese. The translation does get better by the end, and, strangely, becomes very clear during some - though not all - explanations of the stock market and investment banking, but it was a slog. I really had to force myself to read it at the beginning. Betweem the slow story and the poor quality of the translation, it was all I could do to stick with it.\n\nBut I did stick with it.\n\nAnd I was not disappointed.\n\nIt's a slow buildup, but the payoff is pretty damn good. The character development is very real and very defined, and that's something I really appreciate. The characters start off pretty archetypal. You have the protagonist, an angsty, elitist, misanthropic, sociopathic punk, the ojousama character who is totally aloof and doesn't know how the world works, the overly kind caretaker woman whose only real purpose in life seems to just be to be unreasonably kind to strangers, and a smattering of other characters. By the end of the novel, though, you've learned all about their complications, hopes, dreams, and fears, you've seen their true colors and watched them show unexpected sides of themselves, and you've seen each of them, but the protagonist especially, change noticeably.\n\nAnd of course, there's the investment banking aspect. Who knew trading stocks could be so tense and exciting? There are a few moments near the end where you really are on the edge of your seat, and the outcomes do tend to be very unexpected. The end of the novel, where the reader's patience really starts paying off, is an emotional roller coaster as full of as many highs and lows as a graph of the stock market, and while not all of it has to do with day trading, the parts that do are far from boring - and I say that as someone who can barely do multiplication in his head. True, some of the concepts were over my head, and I totally got lost in some explanations and events, but ultimately, I enjoyed it.\n\nPersonally, I think the payoff is worth it. Under other circumstances, I wouldn't have read past the first few hours, but in the end, I'm glad I did. If you're willing to sit through the first 2-4 hours of boring exposition (Yeah, I know, not exactly a bullish proposal, hurrhurrhurr), you'll be rewarded by the end if you like stories with good plot and character development.","November 9, 2015","true","50.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The art is also more than acceptable, but it is not the leading edge in animation.\n\nIt is not voiced, which I do not mind, and it is not animated, which I once again do not mind. However, sometimes it seems like the game refreshes or reloads assets. The images vanish, leaving a white screen, before they return. The music also resets randomly it seems. My final complain is the grammatical errors that the English translation has. Every now and then you would find mistakes, but they would not be making the sentence confusing or impossible to understand. They are also rare enough that they do not become a problem. More an annoyance every x minutes. The Japanese one was mostly flawless.\n\nAs for the characters and story development, the pacing is very good. It holds back information just enough that you are at the edge of your seat and sometimes wish for nothing more than for the character to say it. However, that is the great part. You really feel that the characters have their secrets, doubts and troubles. At the same time the story is driven by each character's hopes and goals in this world. They live normal, hard lives and have to make compromises as they go. These compromises and the decisions they face really feel like something a human with their personality would make.\n\nThe best part for me is that it is not a fanservice, cliché or love story. Most of all it is not a romantic comedy, which makes it heaps and bounds better than most.\n\nHighly recommended for the full price.","August 12, 2015","true","29.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Isuna Hasekura's previous work, Spice & Wolf, revolves around trading. This time, WORLD END ECONOMiCA episode.01, revolves around Stocks and it's Market. I am amazed at how the author succinctly mixes different genres in this Visual Novel, much like Spice & Wolf.\n\nWORLD END ECONOMiCA has three games, namely episode.01/02/03.\n\nHowever, one should not compare Isuna Hasekura's Spice & Wolf and WORLD END ECONOMiCA, as the former is a Light Novel and the latter being a Visual Novel. Of course the manner of telling the story is significally different, as a Visual Novel introduces music and accompanying CG to maximize the tone of the current atmosphere and situation but with less words to further balance the narration of story by giving the personality to the CGs and sprites, while the words supply the story itself, unlike a Light Novel where the artworks are introduced at the start of reading, but it just introduces the setting and vibe of the story being told, with the descriptive narrative giving most of a Light Novel's shine. Nonetheless, one should not underestimate Isuna Hasekura, and one should know that the author would definitely give a story that is rich and fantastic.\n\n\n\nPROS:\n- Fantastic setting and atmosphere\n- Rich character development\n- Character personalities are well-developed, and makes them stand out at each other\n- Nice soundtrack that optimizes the tone of the current situation\n- Cute and well-drawn character art and CG\n- Length of the Visual Novel is enough to deliver the story\n-  Made by Isuna Hasekura!\n\nCONS:\n- The opening to the story is a bit bland in my opinion\n- The Main Character has an unlikeable personality, and makes rash cynical decisions (but this will be remedied later on)\n- The explanation about Stocks are long and a bit confusing if not understood clearly (Seeing the Visual Novel is about Stocks, I'd recommend anyone to have atleast a very basic information about Stocks and its workaround)\n- There are very few soundtracks to begin with. And a few of these are incorrectly looped.\n- This Visual Novel does not yet support Steam Overlay, and its current engine does not yet support Achievements and Trading Cards (However, this will be also remedied later on)\n-  Sadly, there is no Holo\n-  THAT ♥♥♥♥ING CLIFFHANGER!!!\n\n\n\nOverall, I would recommend WORLD END ECONOMiCA episode.01 to those people who likes Light Novels and Kinetic Novels in general. Please be reminded that there will be an update that makes it compatible with Steam Overlay, Steam Achievements and Trading Cards, though. The stories are long, too. I'd advise you to wait for Sekai Project to release all the episodes, because then they would patch them to a different engine.","April 11","true","8.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Being that it is part of a three part series, its true ending depends on the ending of the third part (since it's one cohesive work). However...the fact that it's separated means it should be able to stand on its own, right?\n\nAnd, well, yeah, it does, for the most part. The plot in the VN is self contained, and isn't actually too shabby. We follow a boy name Hal on his endeavors to basically use the stock market to get rich quick (as quick as you can with stocks). He lives on the Moon, known for being a huge financial district (think of Wall Street...but ON THE MOON!). Through a series of events, he comes to live with Lisa and Hagana, and forms relationships with them as well as the rest of the poorer denizens of the street. Stocks are made exciting, and there's a climax at the end that I think plays pretty well into the story. The double eged sword I have with this VN was the economic jargon that is pretty much rampant throughout the VN, as I found it added authenticity and made stocks interesting, but at the same time was an incredible chore to slough through (only because I am not THAT huge of a fan of econ).\n\nThe characters all fall into specific roles, and the problem with this VN is that the development is almost nonexistent. Well, it's actually unfair to say it's not there. It's there, but it goes by in increments. Thus, change can seem to be missing in their character developments. I would argue, however, that the end and the fact there are two other parts means that what you see are their characters on the cusp of their development, and that to truly see how far they've come it's best to read the entire work.\n\nWriting wise, there were a few awkward word choices, and art wise the art is OK but definitely improved later. The characters all speak in different ways, making it easy to distinguish characters, which I love. There is romance, but it isn't a big overblown affair and is actually subtle and sweet, though a bit too subtle if you ask me.\n\nIf you are looking for stories about ambitious, driven main characters with a big ol' helping of Economics and some sci-fi then I definitely recommend this.

Despite all the exposition about how stock trading works and a cast of mostly unlikable characters (who do have redeeming backstories and show development toward the end), I found myself getting invested (if you'll pardon the pun) in this lengthy tale of a pair of runaways trying to play the market and strike it rich in a beautiful domed city on the moon.  Those who pay attention to the details will need to excuse the occasional unintentional retcon as the author misremembers what he had previously established, but apart from that, the writing and art are both excellent.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ProfBaka/recommended/269250/","ProfBaka","Baka","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ProfBaka/","116 products in account","I give this game a 8.5/10\n\nGameplay - 1/10\nThis is a "game" in only the loosest terms possible. It's more like a picture book than a game, there is no interaction from the player other than advancing the words. Unlike most other Visual Novels there aren't even choices to make. Overall this makes for a very boring time if you were looking forward to actually playing something.\n\nStory - 9/10\nSo I don't really know how to judge the entire story at once so I made subcategories\n\nCharacters - 6/10\nNear the beginning most of the characters seem rude or immature. This is in part due to the    players view being the same as the main character who is a young kid and thus has a warped view of his importance and of how others treat him.  Due to the MC's lack of understanding he acts like a jerk for about 3/4ths of the story and ignores the other characters as best as he can. Luckily as the story progresses he matures and most characters become a lot more complicated and understandable.\n\nSetting - 10/10\nThe setting is probably the best defined part of this story. The setting is really at the heart of this story and even with the limited parts we see and read about seems quite well thought out. I mean its the freaking moon how awesome is that? but anyways I like the way your idea of the setting changes over the story. It starts out at a high tech moon city where those skilled with money move closer to the center but one misstep and you can be on the outskirts with all the other failures. This makes for quite the interesting place however as the story advances you learn more about the outskirts and those who live there.\n\nPlot - 8.5/10\nPlot, the most important part of a story. The plot starts out with a kid who wants to earn enough money to make his dream come true but this story is really more about growing up and realizing you aren't the most important person in the world. I can't really go into details for spoiler reasons but I think the plot did a good job in the end.\n\nMusic - 7/10\nI'm not really a music fan so my opinion here isn't worth much. I think the music did a good job of conveying the overall feel of the scene. There were 1 or 2 songs that I enjoyed but most where just background sound that helped show the mood. Overall the music was mediocre to me but I'm not a music fan.\n\nArt - 8.5/10\nI'm not really an art enthusiast either but I enjoyed the pictures in this game. The setting shown by the art was very good and painted a nice picture of what the different areas of the moon city looked like. The character were pretty much just generic Anime style art not really a surprise at all.\n\nTranslation/Text 9/10\nWhen I looked at the other reviews I saw mentions of things being poorly translated or glitches causing lines to repeat. I only saw one slight translation error and considering I have forgotten what it was it didn't bother me too much and I figured out the meaning of that area. The main thing I felt was lost in translation was more of a cultural barrier, some of the characters interacted with each other in ways that I as an American would consider odd but would probably be normal in Japan.\n\nTL;DR:  Overall if you want a pretty good story I recommend this game. However if you want a "game" game or a normal visual novel I suggest you look elsewhere.","August 19, 2014","true","14.7"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

If you just stumbled in here this is not for you most of the time.  I am recommending this based on the assumption you got here because you liked Spice and Wolf.  There are no choices here, this is 100% story.\n\nThat being said, I enjoyed it enough to come back for the next episode.  It doesn't hold up compared to Spice and Wolf, but it is worth reading/watching in its own right.  The story takes its time to go anywhere, but as a result you become more attached to the characters, I prefer these types of stories.  If you are a die-hard fan of Spice and Wolf, get this on sale.  It has similarities in characters and economics focus.  At my reading speed it took just over 7 hrs to get through it,  mileage will not vary.\n\nAs for the application/visuals themself, it does leave something to be desired.  The artwork is good, but it seems very static and repetitive.  You will be seeing the same character models and backgrounds for the majority of your time.  The music is good.  Transistions and black screens are really poorly done from what I experienced, if I had a complaint that would be it.  Way too many black screens and the transistions had a tendency to loop on me.\n\nOverall I doubt you stumbled in here randomly, if that is the case I feel you are better off looking elsewhere.  If you came in here due to loving S&W I would like to recommend at least trying this story, it has its own merits.\n","October 14, 2014","true","7.6"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

It moved me much more than I expected. I could really feel the world and imagine how life would be on the Moon.\nThe story brings some uncommon themes such as trading (and it's explained well enough so you don't have to be an expert to follow), space colonization on the moon and the social issues arising from it. The Moon is now the centre of wealth, which happened only because of the hubris of every big corporation from Earth which decided to move there. The Moon is forced to import resources massively from Earth and would actually die fast if the space elevator were to shut down.\nThe main character ran away from his home and seeks to make money with the stock market to achieve his dreams. This game is only the first part so the story keeps going and you will have to wait for the translation to be completed before you can enjoy the end.\nI do have one thing that bothered me in the story about the scientific accuracy. While I won’t argue with how human colonization on the moon was possible (since it is still after all a subject of research), the errors in high school physics (Newton’s law) was a bit more troubling and people ought to remember that while the weight changes on the moon the mass doesn’t and a punch has no reason to be delivered with a different force.","December 29, 2014","true","9.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlackSol/recommended/269250/","BlackSol","Scrap Knight","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlackSol/","68 products in account","TLDR: An enjoyable story with flawed characters that can grow on you over its course. By the writer of Spice and Wolf.\n\nMy only reason for buying this visual novel was that Isuna Hasekura (writer of the Spice and Wolf light novels) wrote this. Upon immersing myself in it, I was surprised to see that there were no choices to be made. As it turns out, WEE is a kinetic visual novel, a VN without choices that is more of a book with music and pictures. Despite that, I continued on. The entire story took me only about 4.5 hours to read, although this is heavily dependant on your reading speed/settings.\n\nArt: The art of the game was average, nothing particurlary standing out to me as being below or above the norms of Japanese visual novels. Character design was also relatively simple, with the typical array of colorfuly designed characters.\n\nCharacters: The characters of WEE part 1 are a varied bunch of people, each with their own issues that are revealed over the course of the story. Unfortunately, the VN suffers from having its entire story set up to lead into parts 2 and 3. The main character begins as an insufferable ♥♥♥♥, which unfortunately can turn off a lot of people. I would suggest sticking through as (and I hate to say this) it does get better.\n\nStory: The story is well thought out and centers predominantly on the issues of its main character as he interacts with the cast of other characters. Stock markets plays an integral role in the story and there is a fair amount of exposition involving them. For those who care, the ending does end in a rather strong cliff hanger that leads into part 2, so don't expect any resolution.\n\nSound: Music was your typical VN fair with electronic tunes to match the futristic setting of the story. I was a fan of the songs used in the opening sequence and the ending credits. The story has no voice acting, so buyer beware if you're expecting to avoid having to read (or like to listen to Japanese people talk in anime speak).\n\n","January 14","true","5.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

My opinion may change when I do.\n\nBG Artwork and character design is pretty good.\n\nStory is boring and most of the stuff looks like filtered wikipedia research (eg. let's throw in some moon facts since the story takes place on the moon). Choice of setting as the moon is really unnecessary. It just gives the writer an excuse to throw in future techs and talk about gravity and make references to 2001: A Space Odyssey.\n\nCharacters are also flat (so far). MC Yoshiharu is bratty like many have mentioned but is also uninteresting to pick at. A typical teenage rebel who thinks he is a level above everyone else. I don't mind the misogynist part of him as much as how dull he is. The other characters whose names I can't even remember are boring as well. Makes reference to the Bible but what does that have to do with anything?\n\nI also don't see how the economic theme factors in. It plays a role in Yoshiharu trading stocks to strike it rich but could they have taken a more dull subject and made it even more dull?\n\nMaybe its the poor English translating that puts me off or just the fact that whatever was written in Japanese didn't carry over so well in English. The writing style is awful and pretentious kind of like some manuscript I wrote when I was in high school. Maybe I just have a higher standard for writing.\n\nI feel like I've wasted too much time trying to read this but I want to see the ending.

Granted I got it in this Visual Novel.\n\nFor me, the characters are well developed. The story takes it times to introduce parts of the character which make me feel sympathized with them.\nThe theme for the story itself, stock market, incorporated really well to the development of the story and the characters. Though, sometimes kinda felt too forced. It's what story revolved in.\n\nThe amount of information is kinda overwhelming. Not something to read in one seat to fully enjoyed it. But, fortunately, no need understanding hi technical things in stock market, the characters' reactions can give us clue as to what happened in the stock market. It might something that not everyone will enjoy, cause the stock market scene happened on daily basis. (numbers, numbers, formula, etc.)\n\nSo yeah. While the VN gets technical on the stock market, it didn't forget to tell story. Touching one even. As I said before, the characters get developed well and therefore make them memorable. Even if this VN set in the future when people can live on the moon, it still address problems we have with real world today.\n\nOutside of the story, I don't have complain for the arts, they are good. The musics also complement the story well. But some problem lies on transitioning from some scenes to scenes were not so smooth, glitchy even. The music also looped at awkward point, kinda shame.

Spice and Wolf also went quite heavy in the technical jargon, but still managed to focus and hook me on the developing relation between the main characters.  This did not pull off that magic.  I feel the characters did not have strong development, and at the end I could care less what happened to them.\n\nThe artwork is well done and pleasing to the eye.  There isn't enough of it though.  There is a small selection of background scenes, and a small number of poses and expressions for each character.  The characters or settings will also not be appropriate to convey the emotion of the scene because of this.\n\nThe background music is entertaining and well done, with most music used effectively to help set the mood.\n\nI finished in just under 11 hours and had to force myself to pay attention and trudge through it until the end.

The translation is wordy, clumsy, and inelegant. There are huge gaps in the game that are silent with no SE or music, even in casual or contemplative moments. The UI is visually overbearing but doesn't have many control options, somehow; I struggled to find a log function (a standard in visual novels) that doesn't exist. Many visual effects activate as text reveals within the textbox, but the gaps in timing aren't set, so if you're like me and choose the maximum speed setting, it just comes off like the screen is flickering awkardly.\n\nI can't draw enough attention to how awkward and wordy this translation is. This story is told from first-person a purposefully wretched main character, so the writing style really needs to shine. It's the kind of stuff you can't imagine anyone having read aloud before putting in. It's fumbly and uncomfortable to read. It makes me wonder if Sekai Project went through any effort at all to rework whatever fan translation they picked up. This is the reason I stay away from getting Sekai Project games.\n\nThis is a very clumsily put together VN. I'm glad I got this through a Humble Bundle instead of anywhere close to full price.

The futuristic moon colony setting isn't really that necessary and I found myself doubting the correctness of the technical explanations on several occasions. There is still two episodes remaining, but as of right now it would probably have been better without the sci-fi setting.\nOne thing I loved about Spice and Wolf is that it presented trading and economic subjects in way which made them interesting. This was not the case with World End Economica 01, I found most of the stock-trading to be pretty boring.\nThe only thing I liked about the story is the coming-of-age elements spread throughout it. It has its ups and downs, but all in all the story is pretty mediocre.\n\nArt: 6 / 10The backgrounds are very well made and looks beautiful. The character sprites and foreground in the event CGs are decent, but the facial expressions often left a lot to be desired.\n\nMusic: 5 / 10Pretty meh. While not exactly bad, there is not a single track worth mentioning.\n\nExecution: 3 / 10This is were it all falls apart. While the story, art, and music is all mediocre, the combination is just terrible.\nThe music is often straight up annoying. Most of the tracks doesn't repeat properly, making a very noticeable and distracting sound each time. The music sometimes doesn't go well with the story, and sometimes there isn't any music playing at all! Some of the transitions between the scenes are rather offsetting, as it can go from being completely silent to suddenly playing energetic music.\nThe backgrounds can feel a bit repetitive at times and sometimes even out-of-place. An example is that the story was describing all the advertisements in the current scene the MC was looking at, however the background art showed a town that didn't contain a single advertisement. An event CG also stayed for too long, making it look like the MC was shouting and shaking the heroine while they where in fact having a casual conversation. And like with the music, sometimes it is just omitted and shows a black screen instead.\n\nWhen the screen is completely black and there is no music playing you can't avoid to think: "this is a visual novel"?\n\nEngine/Translation:There are some visual glitches, for example the text box tends to flicker when going from scene to scene, and the character sprites often momentarily shows in a incorrect position (for like a frame). The opening and credits video is in horrible quality, often being severely pixelated (seriously up to 8x8 pixel blocks).\nI had heard there were issues with the translation, but I was hopeful when I saw there had been an update with a "TLC/edited version of the script". I'm no Grammar Nazi, but it is still pretty bad. Random missing/extra quotation marks are pretty common, line-breaks are sometimes weird, and you can even tell they have not been using a spell-checker. There are also a few scripting errors which causes the text to be incorrectly displayed. It is really disappointing to see again and again that official English translations tends to be crap compared to fan-translations made for free by amateurs. It really makes you realize that "professional" means that you are working for money, and not passion for what you are doing.\n\n\nConclusion:Some of the backgrounds are beautiful, but otherwise this first episode has no strong points. However what it does have is a lot of issues, some technical but most lies in its presentation. The fact that the English translation feels unprofessional doesn't help either.\nWhile the story is not that bad, it is hard to recommend when there are many much better VNs out there.\n\nOverall score: 4 / 10","February 14, 2015","false","16.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

So what's with the thumbs down? I felt that most other aspects of the experience were a let down, or did not do the story justice.\n\nThere are several moments that are just black screens; no characters, no background, just text. Something I felt throughout was that this would have fared better as a paperback novel. If I'm just going to read text with the occasional character scene, I'd rather it be on paper. It doesn't use its visual part of visual novel to the fullest. Many scenes included only background images, and during exposition-heavy scenes, I can understand this. However, many scenes containing dialogue (important dialogue at times) were devoid of character images as well. With something like a paper novel, I can be left to build images of these characters on my own, and with the characters WEE introduced, I don't think that would have been difficult. With the background images stuck on screen, it really pulled me out of what should have been an immersive story.\n\nThe music is not particularly great, either. Most of it didn't seem to fit with the scenes' tones. It felt like foreground music rather than background music; it was very distracting. The few tracks that I did find pleasant would be met with harsh looping transitions that would break the mood, like a record skipping. Using Erik Satie felt cheap after The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya. Coincidence? Maybe?\n\nThis was painfully hard to read through as a kinetic novel because it took a long time to get around to predictable developments. The pacing was slow, and the payoff was weak. Part of the reason why I wasn't expecting to like the story was its lack of an opening hook. I don't think the story really began to produce steam until around 3 hours in! Spoiler talk regarding characters: As a classic tsundere, I think Hagana is great, but I kinda feel like she's the only one with any development during this episode. Most other characters' developments would have happened after the conclusion. For a story that should have me begging for the next episode, it just didn't have that kind of impact on me. During the final moments, I really felt Hagana's pains, just.. watching, and that made the lack of closure rather bitter.\n\nI get that we're only one episode in, but the problems I saw with this one didn't make me eager to pick up the second. I probably will at some point, to see the story to the end. I think it's worth that much, at least. If you perhaps think the same, maybe the recommendation would change for you.

However much of this is smashed by glaring grammatical, editing, and technical flaws. I am also disappointed in the fact that this visual novel has no choices or decisions to be made. 3/10.\n\nA little bit more:\nOkay, so you see that playtime above my review. It's fair to say I've given the game quite a fair shake. I will not spoil anything, but I will tell you the absolute truth as I see it.\n\nThis game suffers from a number of technical glitches. Background transitions are often mistimed and I ran into several intances where the background flashed between two entirely unrelated scenes before settling on the right one. The music, while not bad in and of itself (for the genre of visual novel), is so littered with random, jarring restarts and sudden halts that it really interrupts any chance of getting engaged into the story. Transitions between the various character's expressions sometimes results in the entire text box flickering wildly for a moment. These are all things that could have been solved with a little extra time spent proofing the scenes and should have been before a $13 price tag was attached.\n\nAdditionally, the writing itself had moments that made my brain hurt. Sentences repeat themselves in places (twice with what is clearly a poorly translated first draft of the actual text) and many places had the text unnaturally split between several windows. I got the sense as I read through the novel that whoever translated and/or wrote it was working without a full understanding of the english language. Many passages feel bland or artifically lengthened.\n\nThe story itself I shall resist on critiquing. Every artists has a vision and while one might like or dislike their work, that does not make it bad or good. I rather enjoyed a majority of it, but there were portions that could have been vastly shortened and retained their same impact.\n\nAs a parting note I wish to reiterate to any potential purchasers that this "visual novel" contains no actual choices in it. You do nothing but click through the screens and watch what comes up. This is not stated in the game's description but really should be.","October 19, 2015","false","6.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

In the end, I took a gamble on this thing based on faulty information...but I'm still happy I took the plunge.\n\nUnlike most of the people talking about this game, I didn't come across this thanks to Spice and Wolf, but rather Maoyu, which I (mistakenly; see above) thought was from the same author.  I've heard Maoyu's more contested quality-wise than Spice and Wolf, and it does have its issues, but if it's so much worse, Spice and Wolf is some kind of masterpiece, because Maoyu was able to render me full-on bawling for fifteen minutes straight thanks to the climactic speech in the ninth episode of the anime.  It's pretty difficult for me to cry at stuff these days, and this thing had me going harder than the first five minutes of Up!\n\nSo, with the kind of anticipation that could inspire, I tried World End Economica out, though I wasn't sure how it was going to be.\n\nLemme just say, it started cold.  Hal/Haru is a terrible trash pile of a person loaded with Social Darwinist machismo and casual misogyny.  His internal monologues left me wanting to throw his laptop into a bonfire.  Credit where credit is due, though, he's far from unusual when it comes to teenagers, so I let the story unfold, hoping that Haru's worldview wasn't being supported by the narrative.\n\nI'm glad I stuck it out.\n\nThe characters developed slowly, but that's fine.  When I wasn't yelling for Haru to take the hint from Lisa and stop being an ♥♥♥-ouroburos, I was enjoying the other characters (Lisa especially - she's got the patience of a saint) and the world-building.  It's rare to really get legit hard sci-fi as opposed to sci-fantasy works, and this one delivers on that.  Back to the characters, though; when Haru finally starts to take the hint (thanks to a plot spoiler that had me teary-eyed), things became more enjoyable, and other characters began to open up through his eyes.  Hagana in particular became a favorite.  Her trauma and mental issues spoke to me, and much of my initial dislike for Haru was because of his failure to truly understand what she (or anyone else, for that matter) was going through.\n\nStill, by the end, while remaining a flawed person, Haru had me rooting for him in some of the most tense moments I can remember in a story like this, which is a real feat since the combat, so to speak, is largely cerebral.  The stock trading scenes, especialy the ending, had me glued to my screen, hoping as Haru did for a happy outcome.\n\nIt takes a lot of patience, but I would call this a worthy experience, espcially for fans of hard sci-fi and/or economics.  More than an exercise in world-building, this ends as a powerful story about hope, compassion, and what to value in life.  There are some problems, mostly the rough translation and the lack of variety in artwork, but they didn't interfere too much with my experience.  With interesting (eventually) characters, a strong if slow plot, and a focus on a more cerebral form of conflict, World End Economica stands as a worthy addition to Hasekura's library.","May 6","true","1.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I got the Isuna Hasekura book I wanted to read, along with some pretty nice art. The story was well researched and impressivly not full of holes: there were lots of times where I expected a plot hole, but for every one of them it ended up getting pointed out and involved in the plot. WORLD END ECONOMiCA did this even better than Spice and Wolf in my opinion, which is really quite impressive (Spice and Wolf pulled it off once or twice a book for me, which is still rather amazing). I really wish more authors had his talent for not filling the world with plot holes, which he somehow manages to do even in areas like economics where its so easy to screw it up.\n\nI got what I wanted here: another great book written by Isuna Hasekura. I didn't get a very well put together VN (Lots of free ones have better quality control...), but personally I don't care: I'm here for the characters and story, and that was very well done.\n\nThe editing of the text seemed fine, as did the translation from what I could tell.\n\nPersonally I don't find the main character very likable (who would like a 16 year old bratty boy really: I identify more with Hagane), but it doesn't detract from the entertainment value, and the character is very believable. (Note: Having read several of his stories, I feel better knowing the author is writing a sexist character on purpose: this is clear when comparing it to his other works works. If you want a nice example of his skills writing stories from different perspectives, take a look at book 7 from Spice and Wolf: there is a story from Holo's perspective which is a good read and has a quite different feel to it).\n\nMy complaints below:\n\nWhile the art was pretty nice, it needed more of it, or to at least show it more (too much black screen without even character sprites).\n\nThe audio balance was a mess (even after trying to correct it with the settings). Large sections (and sometimes little bits in the middle) were missing music and ambient sounds and felt out of place. Not all of the music looped smoothly, the background sound effects were mostly too quite for me to even notice compared to the music. None of it was particularly bad (in-fact it was good content), but it was just inconsistently put together: often well done and often distracting.\n\nSeveral scenes for which they already had character sprites did not show any of them, or even any background, just black (and at least once a lighting effect on the black). Its bad when in the middle of an emotional scene I'm googling around to try and sort out if something is just randomly missing or if its a bug and my game is broken.\n\nAt least for me a lot of the animations were glitchy (often one frame with a sprite out if place, and many times the text disappeared for a moment while an animation played). There were tons of momentary screen shakes like if you had been hit at totally incorrect moments: either it was a bunch of software bugs, or a flaky job porting to Ren'Py and/or Linux (at least some of the bugs if not all persisted in the Windows build when I tried it wondering it it might work better). Saves did not sync over steam. Most games on this engine (Ren'Py) work far better than this for me (I've never seen any of these issues before).\n","January 25","true","8.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is written by author of certain popular anime or manga or novel which I never watched or read, so writer's reputation don't mean anything to me. More important that WEE is a kinetic novel, meaning it have no choices at all - reader just follows the story, enjoying music and art on the way.\n\nHal, the protagonist with whom audience supposed to identify, seems like an extremely poor choice for viewpoint character at first. He's unlikeable, arrogant and cynical, fixed only on making profits, idolizes rich entrepreneurs and despises poor common workers. Thankfully, he undergoes huge character development during the novel and becomes much more pleasant person. However WEE is a quite long novel and reader have to endure jerk Hal for the most of it. Nevertheless the changes in Hal's character are so drastic it's almost unbelievable. In the span of a couple months he goes from having inner monologue like this to going into coma from stress and overexertion while helping the poor.\n\nUnlike characters, writing remains of same questionable quality throughout the whole novel. Two leads are both awkward teenagers and their dialogue is mostly them saying "what" at each other. The plot is centered around economics and stock trading but makes a bad job explaining the details to reader not familiar with this, like myself. Most of the narration during the trading parts is done on black background - was it so hard to draw several pretty graphs to illustrate profits or losses? As a result, I quickly lost all little interest I had to economics and just clicked through trading scenes.\n\nVisuals are nice; backgrounds are clean, but character sprites have a strange problem - shadows applied to their necks drawn with dashes. This single detail makes whole novel look like an amateur work at times. Music is nice as well, but nothing special.\n\nFinal result: WEE starts weak but becomes much better during the final parts. Sadly it is not good enough to keep me interested in episodes 2 and 3.","June 12, 2014","false","19.3"," 23 of 48 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","23","48","0","0"

"Thriller", my ♥♥♥. Steam tells me I've played three hours so far, but it feels like five hours or more.\n\nSo there is this boy who wants to have a bunch of money because money buys power. He runs away from home and picks up stock trading, and like all twelve-year old runaways who trade stocks, he immediately makes a profit of several thousand percents. But danger lurks everywhere, because the police figures him for a bill-dodger and bull-dodgers are second in heinousness only to nuclear terrorists. Oh, and the game is set on the moon, but that's the least weird thing there is.\n\nWhile running away, he meets Lisa, who runs a christian church and offers him shelter, and Hagana, a young girl who is also sheltered by Lisa and whom our protagonist immediately wants to ♥♥♥♥ and take revenge porn pics of. (Note: I am not kidding, this is totally a thing that happens.)\n\nThe next two hours or so are all about economic thrills, and by that I mean buying clothes, paying rent and food, and paying interest rate on loans, which are all really important topics for a teen who has, y'know, A HUGE BUNCH OF MONEY ON HIS BANK ACCOUNT. But fear not, because it's not actually about those daily routines: It's actually about the deep character interaction between Captain Rapeydouche and Hagana. It's some of the most cliché writing I've seen for quite some time and Hagana, with her two facial expressions (one of which can corrode steel from fifty paces and the other one makes her shoot lasers from her eyes), completely fails to be a relatable character.\n\nI'm three hours in, there is no interesting plot in sight for miles, the writing is boring, the characters are all stereotypes (save for Lisa, who desperately wishes to be in another game), there is no interactivity whatsoever and now I'm stopping. I don't care for anything that goes on in this excuse for a visual novel.\n\nOn the plus side, the artwork is nice (if inconsistent). Instead of buying the game, just look at the Steam screenshots.

WEE may be better than some or most of its peers, but it still fails to be good by a reasonable standard.\n\nThe premise is original and the plot mostly hangs together - but with a few pretty big holes. There are only three 'real' characters, and their development arc is not satisfying. I'm sure somebody will say that it is necessary to finish all episodes of WEE, but there is simply no good reason to continue if this is the level of quality.\n\nArt, music, and presentation are all amateurish. There are few drawings available for the few characters, and even then it's relatively flat and simple illustrations. There are only a handful of music tracks, and they loop awkwardly. The generic presentation UI is bland at best. The translation is workaday, with a number of questionable choices.\n\nWEE is passable at its best points and is lousy during the in-between moments. Additional care in the presentation and a willingness to avoid tropes and crutches in favor of authentic character development could help elevate future works.","October 14, 2015","false","10.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

That doesn't even begin to cover it. He's not just sexist. He's dangerous. He's violent, he's sadistic, and he thinks he's entitled to anything he wants. People like him are the reason that women carry pepper spray.\n\nThere were multiple scenes that I really thought were going to turn into ♥♥♥♥ sexual assault scenes. Let me tell you about them.\n\nVery early in the story, the protagonist finds himself waking up in an underground reservoir. He sees someone rummaging through his stuff, so he tackles them. That's not the part I have a problem with. After realizing the person is a girl (Hagana), he notes that they're in a deserted hard-to-find area and decides to "punish" her\n\n"Thankfully, I was in a dark, deserted and hard to see place. I might have lost a fight just now, but if I went at her with all my strength, I knew I would win. Maybe I should take some naked pictures of her and post them online once I was done?"\n\nWHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?\n\nPeople, this is sexual assault. I don't care if she was trying to steal your stuff. This is physical and psychological torture, and it's not okay to do to anyone.\n\nThe only reason he doesn't go through with it is that someone else (Lisa) shows up and he realizes there would be a witness.\n\nThe second scene is also with Hagana and takes place the next in-universe day. Lisa, for some reason, decided it was a good idea to leave this moster alone with Hagana, and it goes about as well as you'd expect.\n\nHagana says "Hmph." and this apparently is the protagonist's tipping point. The music changes and the screen flashes red to show just how angry he is.\n\n"I swear if she said even another word, I was going to tackle her to the ground. When it came to inflicting pain without leaving any marks on the face or body, I happened to know a thing or two about that."\n\n"The only thought in my mind was the delusion of seeing Hagana's cheeky face streaked with tears, begging for forgiveness. It would be good for Hagana to lift up the lid to the abyss of hell. That would teach her."\n\nWhat is wrong with you?\n\nWhat is going on in your head where you think LITERAL TORTURE is an ok punishment for the crime of "being rude"? What is going on in your head where you think you have the right to dole out any kind of punishment AT ALL? So she doesn't like you. Big deal! She has a right to not like you, especially after you nearly ♥♥♥♥♥ sexually assaulted her. Grow up and learn to deal with it!\n\nOnce again, Lisa shows up and prevents the protagonist from doing something terrible. God bless you, Lisa. But when are you going to realize what kind of terrible monster you've brought into your house, and kick him out?\n\nI stopped playing shortly after this. I can play games with unlikeable protagonists. I can play games with protagonists whose political ideals don't mesh so well with mine. But this protagonist is something else entirely.\n\nI think a lot of men don't understand how much mental energy goes into trying to be safe, so let me tell you. I don't carry pepper spray because I think it's a pretty accessory. I don't turn down rides from strangers or near-strangers because I like walking in the pouring rain. I don't text my friends every time I leave the house because I think they'll find it academically fascinating. I do these things because people like our darling protagonist here exist, and are all too common.\n\nAnd, personally, I don't want to have to think about this when I'm safe at home trying to play a g.d. video game.\n\nEven if you somehow manage to put the misogynistic b.s. aside, the protagonist is incredibly unlikeable.\n\nHe's judgmental and rude for no reason at all. The first line of dialogue in the game is the clerk at an internet cafe telling him "Fine day, isn't it?" The protagonist's response is "A 'fine morning'? I'm not fond of your sarcasm. Earth dog." He later reveals that he was so rude because he "was sure that he was some loser who worked there by the hour."\n\nHe constantly whines about everything. Oh, no, this restaurant has second-hand tables, whine whine whine. Oh, those middle-class suburbs are too neat, whine whine whine. Oh, this lady is trying to make conversation with me, whine whine whine. Being sent to school is being "forced to report to a local facility every day" while growing "further and further away from the front-line of the world" and "eventually [being] swallowed up by the masses."\n\nHe thinks he is the specialest snowflake ever and he brags constantly about how he "[doesn't] have enough time to earn an honest living," how he's going to "stand at the forefront of humanity," how rich he is, how athletic he is, how he has more money than anyone else his age, how there's "no way [I'll] be eating in a lame restaurant like this" in five years, how he'll "eventually be wearing a stylish suit and living in a high-rise apartment in Newton City," "outwit the geniuses and prodigies from Earth to take my rightful place there at last", blah blah blah. Someone offers him several jobs and he whines because they're low-paying jobs for unskilled workers, and Mr. Specialest Sixteen Year Old High School Dropout On The Moon deserves far better. Oh please.\n\nI'm so disappointed in this game.\n\nEDIT: Apparently steam thinks r.a.p.e is a swear word, and blocks it out. (Why?) Going back now to change every time I wrote that to "sexual assault." Thanks, Steam. -_-","March 10, 2015","false","5.5"," 12 of 27 people (44%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","44","12","27","6","0"

It is also one of my first visual novels I've read, and I'm glad it's for my native platform.\n\nThat being said, I can't really get into the story.\n\nBasically, you make no decisions, so it's just a scrolling novel. The story is pretty flat, with a few pictures here and there and some scenery from time to time. That being said, the pictures are fair to good and the story follows a very generic and bland character who is annoying and greedy. He basically just wants to make money. Lots and lots of money. And he's got a whole lot of money already, but since he's too young, he needs to hide while making more.\n\nSince the text is captured on the bottom the page, it's basically just a slow, slow scroll through the story.\n\nAdditionally, this is only part 1 of 3. Maybe the story will turn around and really grip me and make me love it, but I feel it would be better served as a light novel than a visual novel.","June 4, 2015","false","7.2"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","0"

I like the similar art style and focus on economics and business, but compared to watching an anime, it's very slow (I could watch the two OAV seasons of Spice and Wolf in half the time), and the art is relatively sparse. There are a few typos in the translation and the sometimes repetitive music can be distracting. Despite the massive reams of text, character development is quite slow (though it's there) and it's hard to feel much sympathy or connection to the characters.\n\nBottom line: It's fine if you're used to VNs, and I don't regret spending the time and money on this, but I probably wouldn't do it again. I prefer Telltale's stories (Walking Dead, Wolf Among Us)- the execution and production values are far superior, and were simply more enjoyable and engaging for me.","December 31, 2014","false","7.3"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

Passionless and amateurish. Like some bad fanfic... bad. To be as fair as I can I have to admit I haven't finished this. That said though while there may be considerable, all important character development to come it cannot possibly be good enough to redeem the main character. Said character near the beginning of the game is hostile, whose violence is only contained by his cowardice.\nWorst of all this character has a distinctly abusive, disdainful, hateful attitude towards women. In one scene early on he contemplates beating up a girl weaker than him, stripping her naked and posting naked pictures of her online, pausing to appreciate how her surly expression will work to his advantage in such an event. He obviously resents women being anything other than submissive, passive, or at best deferential. His recognition of this thought as "dark" does not redeem him. You can only write about this kind of abominable @#&T if you are capable of doing it with GREAT and clear artistry so as to serve some good, but there is no chance of there being any semblance of *social* commentary at this point. If it arrives later, that will still be too late, in other words it would be artless.\n\nOne of the tags is Kawaii. Kawaii my ♥♥♥♥! Where is the age rating?\n\nYou can't spoil this stuff.

For a while he gets better, but when it comes to crunch time, he slips back into being the person he was at the beginning.\n\nThe end of the story is incredibly stupid and terrible.

It's very dry and tedious, and those parts of the story are extremely boring.\n\nThe art style is jarring. Most backgrounds are more realistic in style, while the characters are clearly very anime.\n\nThere are a handful of typos and blatantly obvious formatting errors.\n\nA decent way into the story, it suddenly decides to spend about two minutes being a cross between an anime opening sequence and a YouTube AMV instead. You cannot fast-forward through this.\n\nThere does not appear to be a way to go back if you accidentally skipped some text.

(Second game of the series)\n\nBeing the first episode of three, the writer starts off with some heavy world building, which may seem to slow the pace of the story significantly but the pace speeds up to Haru's (Hal's) abrupt end of childhood. The economic jargon can also be a turn off, especially if reading in a language that isn't your mother tongue. Despite these faults the top notch writing and good translation more than make up for these.\n\nThe first episode ends in a sort of tragedy, but even then I would recommend this to some of the more critical literary readers. Essentially the style of writing that is used in this work is a character game or "chara-ge" as the plot could hardly be said to be the main focus, although it is interesting in it's own right. What makes this game shine is the interaction between it's characters. In episode 1 this would predominantly be Hagana and Haru. I'll be honest, I never really liked the stereotypical cold, blunt characters that are kuuderes but Hagana was able to make her way past this prejudice and shine as a character in her own right. The dialogue in this game is nothing short of excellent. Risa in particular has some fairly thought-provoking things to say.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone that likes a good story. Also with the eventual introduction of Elanor (best girl) in the second episode, I would definitely recommend this game to people that like smart, fun dialogue with interesting characters. Readers that prefer a fair amount of moe in their games also might find this series decent, though most of it is more in the background rather than the main focus.","January 29, 2015","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Since there isn't much to describe when it comes to a book with pictures, i'll give you what I can. I definitely didn't hate this. I didn't particularly think it was fantastic though. I had moments where it made me laugh, or thoughts of mine would seemingly match the novel itself. But I don't believe it hit me as hard as other novels have. Perhaps it was the way the protagonist had some strange consistent thought process, that seemed all too focused on giving people genres and ordering people by comparison. But "The feels" were not strong for me for this title, unfortunately. Also, quite confusing, and complex. If you don't like those two things.

Scene changes tend to be a black, blank screen, with a few flashes or short clips of image. Music is simple, elegant, and tactful, if limited in flavour. Finally, the VN is a long read, I felt I got my worth for sure.\n\nThe biggest issue I had, was again, the ending.\nTo quote another reader, "This ending was extremly abrupt. It hurt me on so many levels and left me really upset. Not only are there no "routes" as its a single story but to end Ep 1 on that note my chest hurts atm. That was really painful for me.

They seemed a bit one note, with the main character's slight crudeness and myopia being contrasted with his co-lead's incredible coldness.

The characters at least, I'd thought, were not the strong point.\n\nOh how I was wrong. The beginning is slow to be sure, but the subtle tendrils of the character growth slowly worm their way into your heart. By the end of the story, I was sucked by the emotional and character themes that were marched in front of me so many times at the beginning I thought of them as set dressing until they became very, movingly real during the end portion.\n\nAbsolutely recommended, but with a (perhaps obvious) warning that the story doesn't end here, or even wrap up an arc in such a way that you aren't demanding more.

No surprise given the title, a lot of the text you will be reading involves things about trading stocks. The concepts used are explained relatively well in the without feeling as forced. In the end though, the trading is used in the story, but not what the story is about.  As for the conclusion of this episode, a lot of reviews already contain hints about that, so I’ll keep it short and say it seems like a good start for the second episode.\n\nWhile I like this novel, it does have some week points. The backgrounds are nice, but there are not a lot of them. The same can be said for the character poses and expressions, having some more variations there wouldn’t have hurt. The amount of CG’s is very limited, but the quality of the ones that are there is good. Just as the backgrounds are often repeated so is the music with a sometimes bit to audible loop. However, if you don’t mind a visual novel where you don’t make any choices, then don’t let the downsides dissuade you from reading it.\n","February 28, 2015","true","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I wasn't sure whether I'd be into this VN, and instead I have found that I totally utterly love it!!!\n\nHaving gone through some excellent VN's, and some not too crash hot ones, I can safely say that the same emotional journey I got from Spice & Wolf the anime is well and truly replicated here!  I for one eagerly await the other two parts of this VN - count me in for pre-orders! :D\n\nExcellent art style, if a tad bland in some sections (tho it did match the storyline at those points), good choices with music - tho at times the music did get repetitive it didn't feel like it detracted from the flow - and unlike some VN's it matched the mood/feel of the content at the time.\n\nWithout spoiling things, I felt as moved by this as I did by Eden, or Reverie - my two other all time VN favourites!  Yes, this is linear, but so is a normal book or manga - it's the content that grips you and to me that shows the mark of the content - how much it grabs you and holds you.  Even though this is the first of a trilogy, it doesn't leave you massively dissatisfied at the end - yes, I really really want the next episode, but I want it without frustration if that makes sense.\n\nThe overall tone/mood will not be to everyone's tastes, nor will the pacing - but for me it's damned close to perfect.  Again the emotional side of it will also not be to everyone's taste, nor will the lack of H content, but if you want those, you likely be better served with other options like Eden Mosaic ed, or Hunie Pop or such like.  I personally love the rollercoaster this has on me - ymmv.\n\nOverall, I seriously recommend picking this up now - don't wait for a sale - you honestly don't know what you'll be missing out on if you do!","February 18, 2015","true","11.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now that's an unique setting :-).\n\nAs expected, he has to mature by leaps and bounds, especially when he runs against people with very different views and backgrounds than his. (Yes, he is a bit of an insufferable prick at first, but hey, he was a teenager boy with issues!)\n\nThe story was quite well written, and makes up for the strange occasional hiccups in the adaptation of the original version to the Ren'Py engine and the odd sequence with no matching background (tsk, tsk). You also get to learn a bit about some of the complexities of the stock market, where it is entirely possible to buy things with money you don't have, and sell things you don't have as well!\n\nI'd consider this game as the first episode of Umineko: it starts slow, but it ends on a high note and it really makes you want to start on ep2.

It's more a written story that happens to have music and pretty pictures in the background. If that's not your thing then keep away.\n\nSecond thing would be the technical stuff: The typos in the translation were distracting at times ("sandwitch"? "truely"? a bit more proofreading, please). That and there were a few graphical glitches during some transitions, not to mention some scenes where I wondered if the lack of images was a bug or a weird oversight (mostly when Serrault was involved early on, be it the screen remaining fully-black while a long conversation occurred at the cafe or a picture of him sleeping while he was clearly talking, sitting and even standing in the room).\n\nThankfully, none of that fully detracts from the whole. Important bit in this type of product is the story, followed by the artwork and ambient music; in all those departments I can't say anything bad about it. Art-wise was good, music conveyed the mood without being distracting and the writing was top-notch. The story is deeply-engrossing and the characters well-developed, though as expected from the author it's filled with so much technical explanations of complicated concepts that some might be put off by it. I'd say if you're the type of person who doesn't enjoy math or discussions about stocks, the economy and the like then you might not enjoy this one (it's pretty much the main focus). Otherwise, give it a try - you might be surprised by how it turns out at the end.","March 24, 2015","true","13.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(Second game of the series)\n\nBeing the first episode of three, the writer starts off with some heavy world building, which may seem to slow the pace of the story significantly but the pace speeds up to Haru's (Hal's) abrupt end of childhood. The economic jargon can also be a turn off, especially if reading in a language that isn't your mother tongue. Despite these faults the top notch writing and good translation more than make up for these.\n\nThe first episode ends in a sort of tragedy, but even then I would recommend this to some of the more critical literary readers. Essentially the style of writing that is used in this work is a character game or "chara-ge" as the plot could hardly be said to be the main focus, although it is interesting in it's own right. What makes this game shine is the interaction between it's characters. In episode 1 this would predominantly be Hagana and Haru. I'll be honest, I never really liked the stereotypical cold, blunt characters that are kuuderes but Hagana was able to make her way past this prejudice and shine as a character in her own right. The dialogue in this game is nothing short of excellent. Risa in particular has some fairly thought-provoking things to say.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone that likes a good story. Also with the eventual introduction of Elanor (best girl) in the second episode, I would definitely recommend this game to people that like smart, fun dialogue with interesting characters. Readers that prefer a fair amount of moe in their games also might find this series decent, though most of it is more in the background rather than the main focus.","January 29, 2015","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I wasn't sure whether I'd be into this VN, and instead I have found that I totally utterly love it!!!\n\nHaving gone through some excellent VN's, and some not too crash hot ones, I can safely say that the same emotional journey I got from Spice & Wolf the anime is well and truly replicated here!  I for one eagerly await the other two parts of this VN - count me in for pre-orders! :D\n\nExcellent art style, if a tad bland in some sections (tho it did match the storyline at those points), good choices with music - tho at times the music did get repetitive it didn't feel like it detracted from the flow - and unlike some VN's it matched the mood/feel of the content at the time.\n\nWithout spoiling things, I felt as moved by this as I did by Eden, or Reverie - my two other all time VN favourites!  Yes, this is linear, but so is a normal book or manga - it's the content that grips you and to me that shows the mark of the content - how much it grabs you and holds you.  Even though this is the first of a trilogy, it doesn't leave you massively dissatisfied at the end - yes, I really really want the next episode, but I want it without frustration if that makes sense.\n\nThe overall tone/mood will not be to everyone's tastes, nor will the pacing - but for me it's damned close to perfect.  Again the emotional side of it will also not be to everyone's taste, nor will the lack of H content, but if you want those, you likely be better served with other options like Eden Mosaic ed, or Hunie Pop or such like.

The writing really takes front seat in this one, as the artwork is limited and much of the story actually takes place over black screens.  If that bothers you, take comfort in the knowledge that the author makes his living writing actual novels which are carried entirely by the text.  And the writing here lives up to that expectation of excellence.\n\nJust like in Spice and Wolf, Isuna Hasekura proves once again that you don't necessarily need to understand all the details of the plot to fall in love with a story and its characters.  I have a difficult time wrapping my head around economic concepts, so often failed to understand elements of the plot in this VN.\n\nIt probably doesn't help that it's merely an adequate translation from Japanese, either.\n\nBut none of that matters, because the stakes are clear and the setting and characters are great.  The ending caught me by surprise, and I can't wait to read the next one.\n\nHighly recommended for fans of story-driven VNs.

Buy it, read it, love it.\n\nStock market fetish: The Visual Novel. I'M JUST KIDDING PEOPLE! DON'T GET YOUR PANTIES IN A TWIST FROM THAT!\n\nOk, seriously now. I have to say that I'm not too interested in visual novels, mainly because the majority of it being nothing but fanservice and bad plot that tries to be anything between softcore porn to fetish fuel (or at least the ones I've found before). I would have never picked this up if it wasn't in the Humble Bundle that this came along with. To my surprise, this was the exact opposite of what I usually expect out of visual novels, and WEE managed to actually get me interested in looking out for more visual novels in the future.\n\nThere were times when WEE melted my heart with its characters and their interactions, and times where it broke it with the situations that occurred as the plot went on. All the characters are memorable and likeable, the story is both heartwarming and tragic, and WEE actually focuses on what's important. I find it even better, that WEE barely has any fanservice to begin with. This visual novel actually takes itself seriously without resorting to saying "LOOKIE HERE WE GOT BOOBIES WE GOT BUTTS WE GOT EVERYTHING AND IT'S ALL TEN TIMES LARGER THAN IN REALITY", which is one of the reasons I absolutely adore WEE. Yeah, I'm not too into fanservice. Don't misunderstand, at times I LOVE fanservice, but when that becomes the main show for something that's supposed to have a decent plot, I find it a cheap way to keep a readers interest.\n\nI honestly can't think of any negatives, ones that aren't nitpicky... So I might as well nitpick a little bit. I understand that the visual novel is called World End ECONOMICA, which refers to the economy factor of the visual novel, but I feel like there was a bit too much stock market talk in it. When the stock market came as a subject, I usually just zoned out, thought to myself "what the heck does any of this mean?" and just clicked through trying to understand but to no avail. It doesn't really take away from the story or anything, I was just left puzzled.\n\nI can't honestly put into words how much I enjoyed reading through this. If you're looking to get into visual novels with a great story like me, start with this one. It's nothing short of a masterpiece I think.","February 25, 2015","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In the process, he ends up getting better understanding of people and you learn that his goals extend to more than just making money.  Expect a lot of investment terms while playing this.  Also expect a lot of reading and clicking, because this is a pure visual novel.  There are absolutely no choices to make.  I wish there were some more visuals to this novel.  There were a few scenes that was all black, plus a few that didn't quite match the context.  For example, one scene has a guy sleeping on a couch.  The story then has him wake up, move to a desk, and start working, but the scene still shows him lying on the couch.  It becomes a little immersion breaking.  There are also a noticeable number of typos that should not be in professional product, especially ones that could be caught with spell check.\n\nDespite the flaws, if you are into visual novels, or reading in general, I recommend giving World End Economica a try.  I have not seen much else like it.  I look forward to reading the sequels.\n","November 13, 2015","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This means that if you want a game with your story, you should probably look elsewhere.\n\nBut for those who want a good story, this is what you will get. Its a pretty beefy visual novel, definitely longer than many others on steam. Its storytelling approach isn't completely in your face, and handles situations that would be used for comic relief or fan service in a way that is mature - something of a rarity in these stories.\n\nThe only thing that bogs this game down is that, occasionally, the text is a bit haphazard. Some punctuation might be misused or a sentence might not flow properly. It doesn't break the story, but its a noticable thing.\n\nIf you're a fan of visual/kinetic novels, particulalrly Dysfunctional Systems, this is definitely worth a look.","June 25, 2014","true","12.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are a few typos, but not enough to make a large impact.
