Its amazing.\n\nZombie shooter is an overhead action/shooter/rpg?? game that delivers nicely.\n\nAn alien treath has arrived to earth and is decimating the population. Your mission is to find how did they arrived and to destroy them. Could say more, but thats about right for the story (and i wouldnt like to give spoilers).\n\nAnyways, a description of some aspects of the game.\n\nVariety of enemies. Unlike many "Horde" games, this one has quite a decent number of enemies. The combination of the different classes of the enemies in the screen makes the game actually decently hard. Not to mention, i have never seen a game with so many enemies at the same time.\n\nGood amount of weapons, most do well, some are specialized in certain situations only, but there are few that are all round up. Still, plenty to satisfy your gamestyle.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, you have a "special trait" that you can choose,  which ranges from being able to recover some health x second to have some extra perception (for being able to find secrets), among others. Although you can clear the game with any, changing from one to another may affect how you progress in the game drastically according to your style of gameplay. Choose wisely.\n\nYou can use some vehicles. Not many, but its fun to squash aliens with a tank, not to mention that they would kill you in matter of secons if you are not inside.\n\nSecret areas. To aditionally keep you busy, the game has many secret areas, most are just an extra room with some money/weapons, but you do feel rewarded, since its a decent extra loot for finding it. i found a lot, but way too far from finding every single one for every single level.\n\nPlaying time:\nI finished this game a long time ago, i dont remember how many missions does it has (around 30), but the time to complete the game is around 7-8 hours since most missions are short, however, if you are looking every secret, killing most monsters, etc, ill be a lil bit longer. Also, the end missions are harder, and i mean it, sometimes takes longer to complete those ones (since you have only 3 lives) if going carefully.\n\nReplay value: This game is very fun, but the amount of enemies is overwhelming, that i can become tedious at times (so basically, at the end of the game you should have slayed a couple of MILLIONS of enemies) so yeah, virtually the grey floor is red at the end of the mission. Each time you play it, you can go for different characters/stats/passive trait, but at the end, you will do about the same build, the replay value relays on killing the alien horde over and over and over again. (This is my first run with this game @Steam, but i have finished it lile 10 times or so)\n\n\nGraphics. The game is not new, it has some 5~7 years under the belt, and still look nice. but seriously graphics is not really an issue,  my graphics card (ati radeon 3870 at the time.) was having some trouble at the final stage due to the amount of enemies at the same time. medium graphics are OK for this game.\n\nSound. Not a masterpiece for sure, but it does the job, sets the mood in the game, you forget about it.\n\n\nBad things\nIt has a co-op survival and probably a versus mode i think, Shame that no one is online ever, it might be fun to have a partner.\n\nSurvival is fun but alone feels like meh. Its quite challenging though.\n\nDumb AI. Although they will always try to get you, some will stuck in corners or any object that is in  between, some will stuck with other aliens. However, not a great deal, since there are many enemies, being stuck they will not overwhelm you from all sides every single time, you can create some bottlenecks.\n\nNot my intention to write a wall of text, but just to give you a general idea for your money. (probably worth 15~ bucks )","January 16, 2014","true","12.6"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","0"

But Alien Shooter is not an RPG. It's all about the mindless action. Notice the adjective mindless! You press down your left mouse button and you do not stop until all aliens are dead. At the same time, of course, you try to get away from the smaller creatures and avoid the projectiles of the bigger ones.\n\nAlthough the game has some RPG elements (you can visit stores regularly and there's levelling up) main emphasis is on the action. It's a shame that SIGMA made this game very short and that they recycled most of the elements in the game that later became known as Zombie Shooter part 1 and part 2. I assume the game's next installment, Conscription, looks and plays exactly like this one so I did not bother purchasing it.\n\nStill, you can pick up this one or one of the Zombie Shooter versions and have a couple of hours of fun when SIGMA games are on sale.","January 5, 2014","true","2.8"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

Much like its predecessor, you spend the game shooting lots and lots of aliens. It improves on the original in many ways, and in the process becomes a game that can become worthy of some of your time.\n\nThe graphics have seen a marked improvement in AS2. Everything looks crisper, there's more details to the characters and environments, and the aliens are varied and unique. The shooting is also much improved, with aiming being much tighter. The movement controls are as crisp as the original. You will be spending a lot of time dancing around with WASD and holding the left mouse button, so get used to that.\n\nAS2 has some RPG lite elements. You earn experience through your actions, and can level up in about 6 categories. I am not quite sure how a high intelligence would help you in this game, but it is one of the categories. You also spend your cash on weapon upgrades to help your hunting a little easier.\n\nAlien Shooter 2 has voice acting that is serviceable, and the music adds a nice touch much like the original.\n\nAlien Shooter 2: Reloaded can be recommended for the improvements that were made over its predecessor. All of the major flaws were addressed, with better controls, graphics and enemy variety. If you are looking for a mindless shooter than this game is worthy of a try.\n\nGrade: C+","June 29, 2014","true","0.9"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","0"

The developer clearly wanted to make a game that has constant action and they achieved that. This game barely has a moment without combat, which I like as sometimes it is nice to play a game that is just crazy gameplay. The player will constantly be backpedaling as they shoot the endless waves of aliens, somewhat like Smash TV.\n\nWhen the player kills a significant number of enemies, they level up and are given 5 skill points per level to improve the character's stats. For example, the player can upgrade their 'accuracy' stat which dictates how much damage the player will do. The player can also improve their health, strength, speed, intelligence and a 'special' skill such as health regeneration. The player can also manage an inventory and buy items from a shop located in every level. The aforementioned features are the RPG elements of this game - very light RPG elements I might add. If you're looking for a game with deep stat customization or indepth weapon info, you'll be disappointed with this game. I think the RPG elements in this game are perfect for an arcade shooter such as this one.\n\nThe story is simple: evil corporation delves into the unknown and brings forth human killing aliens. Your job is to investigate what happened and eradicate all alien life, discreetly of course. Weyland Yu- excuse me, M.A.G.M.A. corp will be the majority of the locations you visit. Labs, armories and sewers.\nThe voice acting is pretty bad and gives off a 'cheap' vibe but I believe it is forgivable considering the main point of the game is to blast aliens to smithereens and the developers are a very small team of Russians.\n\nThe music is good! They advertise it as dynamic but this basically means that the game will begin playing 'action' music during battles and atmospheric music during non-combat sections. The action music is catchy and nice to blast aliens to, while the atmospheric music is even better and as it is actually creepy and gives off a horror vibe. The player will hear distant roars, buzzing and generally the noises of dread. Love it.\n\nGraphics are not bad but obviously not good either. What annoyed me is the fact that the game doesn't include a 1920 x 1080 resolution, which is strange considering it was developed in 2007. So expect aliased graphics. Besides that, the enviroments do look good. The labs are realistic but appear fictional at the same time, the alien design is reminiscent of aliens from other works of fiction but overall I liked it. The gore is fantastic and it will never get old blowing a hole in an alien's stomach.\n\nThe game isn't very long, only about 5 hours on normal difficulty but the player can lengthen this by playing on a harder difficulty. There is two submodes called Stand Firm and Gun Stand but only Gun Stand is worth playing. Basically you defend a spot against alien waves and upgrade your turret. I recommend this game if you enjoy games like Smash TV or arcade shooters.\n\n6/10","March 27","true","5.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This sequel was even better.\n\nIt maintains the base gameplay of the original game - move around, aim with the mouse, shoot aliens. However, it also includes more things that make the game much more interesting. Attributes weigh quite heavily on gameplay, hence leveling up really does make a difference. The perks are quite interesting and varied.\n\nThe best of all is actually the variety of weapons. Even among weapons of the same type (shotguns, automatic weapons, etc), there's often a large difference as they vary heavily on damage, reload times, fire rate and accuracy. The game actually makes the player want to purchase new weapons and test them out against enemies - and some weapons are just crazy fun to use (the miniguns are a personal favorite of mine).\n\nBigger variety of enemies and the addition of vehicles are also considerable improvements.\n\nCamera is still an issue. Just like its predecessor, camera angle is fixed and there's no transparency effect, meaning there are items and enemies that may be behind walls and the player won't be able to see these.","February 18, 2015","true","6.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

Not that that's saying much, they make some truly dreadful games. But it is still on the higher end of the mediocrity scale where they usually hang dangerously close to the truly abysmal end. They fixed the length of the game and gave it some proper RPG progression mechanics as well as a secrets system to encourage obsessive compulsive disorder. It is better than Zombie Shooter 2, more refined but it is still just another Sigma Team money grab.\n\nIf you got it from the Indie Gala bundle then enjoy it for the few hours you can. If you bought it full price then you're an idiot and should not procreate.\n\nAlso, it might be worth to try it, just for the voice acting which is truly in a league of it's own.

All upgrades are simply improvements over the previous firearm/armor.  There's no thinking required.\n\nBut if you love holding down the mouse key and blowing up swarms of recolored enemies, then this game might be for you.

Anyone who likes this trash is really dumb.\n\nExactly the same game as Zombie Shooter 2, which I have beaten because of my ocd despite it sucking bum nuts, but with aliens! Its max res is 1024x768 which blows, but I have a 39" monitor so I can still see a big game area. The problem is that this game sucks so bad I didn't want to play for more than ten minutes. I learned with Zombie Shooter 2 that these games have to have vsync turned off or it will be an unplayable stutterfest. This game does not have the option to turn vsync off so I had to do so through my Nvidia control panel which isn't a big deal. Normally vsync has to be on or else the screen tears so badly in games that they are unplayable, but you can't notice it in this game unless the screen is shaking from explosions which happened a lot in the first level....\n\n2/10 mindless generic made-in-a-day bottom-rate alien killing. If this took more than one person and one day to make, those people should all be ashamed. These games from this company ♥♥♥♥ing suck. Low budget garbage.

I mean, I spend really many hours playing the first Alien Shooter game - more than 10 years ago when it was added in certain gaming magazine in my country and not so long ago when I get my copy on Steam. So, here I am, after finishing this game. It looks same. It's same gameplay. You could say, the time stopped for this one, even if it was released around 6 years after first game... BUT, there is something that, even tho it's feels old and nostalgic, gives something refreshing. New aliens, new variety of weapons, new level up system, new vehicles, new shooting mode. Yes, a good old game that was improved on so many levels. You can complain about story, about voices or dunno what more BUT that doesn't change one fact - it's still solid and great fun game when it comes to gameplay.\nIf you ever loved first Alien Shooter game, you must play it. Not sure if new players would be pleased with this kind of games in times when, sadly, games are focusing on everything but not on pure fun of playing. I know I will replay it at once when I will feel hunger for some intense action and simply fun of killing tons of aliens.","February 11","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is a huge improvement from part 1 of the series as we have lots of new stuff here, including:\n- different categories of weapons\n- levelling system where we actually allocate points in a simple system\n- we can choose perk at the beginning\n- plot is simple but ok\n\nBe warned though - this is not as brainless shooter as part 1. This is a pretty long game when we consider the genre. Where part 1 was mass shooter, here we have more of a linear plot-driven shooter with lots of enemies.\n\nIf you like Alien Shooter 1 then you can play this one too. If you would like a quick session of alien killing go fo Theseus Return of the Hero instead.\n\nPros:\n- lots of secrets (like 17 for one level!)\n- lite sci-fi plot\n- lots of weapons\n- levelling system is ok\n- even pistols are useful\n- you can drive a car and control a robot later in the game\n- graphics are quite ok for such a game and may resemble some older rpgs\n\nCons:\n- it's really long for an isometric shooter\n- some levels are overly big\n- it can get repetitive pretty fast, as you could have guessed - there are parts where it is best to stand still and fry aliens for about 2 minutes\n- not really hard if you don't rush your way into alien horde\n\nIf you feel that Sigma Team shooters are fine then play this one as well. It's really ok.\n\n----------\nFor anyone interested in joining in on completing your own backlog; check it out here - http://steamcommunity.com/groups/completingthebacklog/discussions/5/530645446320364338/","March 20","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's certainly improved on the 1st one. New weapons, stats and such. Now that's great but, there are pleny of issues with the game too. Counless times I've gotten stuck in a wall, or glitched through a door, stuck between a table and trash can, in between rocks, gotten the truck stuck and ♥♥♥♥ like that. There of course is a way around this. Stay away from lil spaces that you might maybe be able to slip into...there's a chance you can't slip back out. [> - > Take that the wrong way if you want. I don't really care] Sure all the weapon types are diverse, but there are some 'OP' weapons in the game, but that's not really that big a' deal. Sorry this review is kinda wordy, and it's just rambling but uh..In conclusion if you like these sort of top down semi mindless shooters and are okay with the semi weird controls. [w+d=forward. s+d= backwards. I'm sure that makes a bit of sense] then buy it.","March 20","true","18.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
