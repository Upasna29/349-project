If you like Qix this will definitely scratch your itch. The price is great too.","September 17, 2015","true","1.4"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","15","18","0","1"

I got it on sale, but seems like decent value even at normal price. Gameplay is great, probably the best Qix clone I've played, and I've played a fair number of them.\n\nHas some decent chiptunes, I just wish it had more songs since it starts to get repetitive. That's my only complaint.","December 30, 2015","true","2.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Do NOT buy this game if you want value for money.","September 21, 2015","false","0.6"," 4 of 18 people (22%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","22","4","18","2","0"
