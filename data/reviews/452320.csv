You each play as both a spy and a sniper. Basically the left side of your controller controls the spy and the right side controls the sniper. You are tying to perform tasks as a spy while at the same time trying to find and kill other spies with the sniper. It sounds a little more confusing than it is.\n\nBottom line- Its a fun LOCAL (Online says its coming soon) multiplayer game. Fun if you have some roommates you dont mind destroying. Its early access so there are a couple bugs here and there and im sure there will be plenty of additions to the game as time goes on.","April 9","true","1.1"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","21","26","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeeJaxOff/recommended/452320/","TeeJaxOff","TeeJax <3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeeJaxOff/","3933 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nParty Saboteurs is a local multiplayer game (with online multiplayer coming) where you control both a spy whose aim is to sabotage a dinner party, and a sniper who is trying to stop rival spies.\n\nI've been on a bit of a local co-op streak lately and Party Saboteurs caught my eye as it seems like something that veered away from the usual party brawler and into something a bit more like Monaco or Dollar Dash (both of which focused on objectives over combat).\nDespite being in Early Access the game is already showing some great promise. There is a solid foundation idea to the game: you must sabotage a dinner party without being found and killed WHILST trying to stop your rivals from doing the same. Though lacking in content in the way of maps and power-ups right now we are finding the game very, very fun and looking forward to trying it with more than just two of us.\n\nThe game currently has local co-op games modes and challenges with multiplayer being implemented at a later date. The local co-op game mode supports 2 to 4 players and allows up to 8 if you're willing to share each controller with another person but I think this makes the game unenjoyable as controlling both your vision and movement is integral to the gameplay. Once the game starts you can all (discreetly) choose which player you'd like to play as this turn and once everyone is ready it begins. You all have a large cross-hair which you control with one half of the controller and anything outside of the cross-hairs is completely black; the other half of your controller controls your spy which you'll use to activate objectives. Those objectives are dotted around the map and you must get to them and activate them without the others players working out which character you control and consequently sniping you right in the head. This requires multitasking as you have a lot to watch at once without giving yourself away.\n\nThere are other NPCs walking around and the AI seems pretty solid so far, I have killed many, many innocents because I genuinely thought they were my Player 2. In fact there was a moment whilst playing when we BOTH tried to kill the same poor woman who we believed to be the other player...which she wasn't. I found them to mimic the way real players may play with things such as heading towards objectives over time, short pauses in movements then continuing and movement that seemed to blend in or be completely random. It makes the game a lot more challenging and way more fun than if it was easy to work out who was a bot and who wasn't. You'll also find a few power-ups (though not that many right now) that I've seen so far that you can shoot to collect such as a smoke bomb which you can use when you need to as either a distraction or a decoy or another that'll auto complete an objective for you.\n\nThe sound is something I want to mention; I love the music in the game. Each stage has different music which you can see being played by the band at the party. Though a small part of the game not many people would notice, I loved this feature a lot. There are three musicians (that won't start playing their instrument until it actually starts in the soundtrack) per stage each playing a piece of the music you hear whilst playing. You can kill them off one by one and the musical instrument that they are playing will stop until all three are dead and there is just musical silence. There are so many developers that ignore the small little things like that but I think this really does add something to the game. The conversational chatter in the background also enhances the feeling that you're actually at a social gathering/party making the whole experience ten times better.\n\nA few suggestions would be to maybe add a harder game mode where there are things like as more innocents are killed there is more panic among the other guests making them move more or possibly faster or maybe even introducing things like detectives you must avoid in order to not be arrested. It would also be good to see different types of objectives, maybe some that require more than just one action, such as taking an item to another part of the room aka poison into a wine decanter or removing files from a desk; just something to make your objectives feel a little more meaningful.\n\nThe only cons I can really find to the game so far is the lack of stages and power ups which I hope will be added whilst the game is in Early Access. The other issue is the time it takes to capture an objective. We both found it to be a little too long as it's made very clear to the other players by the large circle that fills around your cross hair that you are taking an objective at that time. It makes it very easy to just watch the other players cross hairs whilst having your own positioned between objectives then quickly check them all when you see it for quick and easy kills without using your spy at all. It might also be nice to add some larger maps with more NPC's wandering around for those who want a little more of a challenge.\n\nOverall I can see so much potential to this game and I can't wait to see it fully fleshed out and completed when it's Early Access is over. The price point is perfect at around $2.50 per player (local multiplayer) and for what you get it's great value. This is one of the most enjoyable local multiplayer games I've played in a long, long time and one that's well worth keeping an eye out for in it's completed form.","April 20","true","2.9"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

The description should clearly state this, and I hope that it gets updated with standard PC controls...

We only tried it locally with a few xbox 360 controllers hooked up.  It looks like they've enabled keyboard controls but we didn't try them.\n\nPro:\n-Simple gameplay\n-Multiple methods to winning\n-Penalty for shooting the wrong person is justified\n-Fairly easy to blend in\n\nCons:\n-You may peak your mics if playing with friends\n-You may not like your friends much after playing\n-Only 4 levels so far\n-Would like to see more hidden things (like if you put your crosshairs on a cat)","April 21","true","1.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

If there is anyway to play this with keyboard and mouse i would gladly give it another go, but as is, i just cant recommend it.  Really hoping this issue might get fixed sometime soon, like i said, I'll be happy to give it another go.","April 12","false","0.2"," 14 of 32 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","14","32","0","0"
