As the game describes, it plays like a Dungeon Crawler mixed with Minesweeper.  If you've ever looked at or played a game on Steam called Runestone Keeper, the gameplay is very similar.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION:\n\nAs the game begins you have one class unlocked (Paladin) and you can unlock the other 3 as you progress through the game's Acts.  In each act there is a number of stages for you to complete in order to finish the act.  Each dungeon comprises of a sort of turn-based tile exploration, which can result in finding treasure, items, or enemies to combat.  Some of the enemies have different passive and active skills, and can even interact with other monsters in the dungeon, so I find it's best to fight them 1 on 1 rather than reveal a whole bunch of nasties at once.  Your character has skills, a small inventory, and stats like Health, Armor, Charge, and Attack Power that you need to monitor and upgrade to progress.  Overall it's a fun game, and I enjoy games like this.\n\nPROS:\n\n-Cute graphics and art style\n-Unique items and enemies\n-Complex gameplay, makes you think before acting (can be a Pro or Con depending on the user)\n-Turn Based\n-Rewarding in terms of making your character better after progress through dungeons/bosses\n-Good amount of voice-acting (for your playable characters anyway)\n\n\nCONS:\n\n-The game is a tad bit expensive in my opinion, however I will have to see how much time I can actually put into this before I make that claim (will edit later if need be).\n-Sometimes the UI feels a bit counter-intuitive, I feel like they could make it a little smoother, but it's not horrible.\n-(placeholder for editing later)\n\n\nTL;DR:\n\nThis game is a pretty good turn-based RPG dungeon crawling tile exploration game.  For $9 you can't really go wrong, and in the time I've played it so far, it's been fun and addicting.  If this is your last $9 to your name, I would suggest saving it to feed yourself, otherwise, give this game a shot.  There aren't TONS of these types of games on the market, but there's definitely a niche for them.\n\n8.5 Mouses Named Tom out of 10.\n\n\nSUGGESTIONS:\n\n-Maybe some kind of bank you can put gold in between dungeons that returns your money after a successfully completed dungeon + interest?\n\n-More characters please <3\n\n-Add an option to click the mouse during dialogue so that it skips to the end of their text sentence so we don't have to watch the painfully slow text fill in.\n\n-Maybe have the merchant offer 1 more item, and this final item is a super good one but really expensive?","February 18","true","4.0"," 36 of 43 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","36","43","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/athravan/recommended/403940/","athravan","Athravan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/athravan/","863 products in account","Casual Strategy Fun\nDungelot was the very first game I played on my iPad, and introduced me to the fact the casual / mobile gaming could have strategy and depth. This is a PC port of the sequel to that original iOS game, Shattered Lands. I decided to give it a purchase and see how it stands up as a full PC game, and the answer is very well!\n\nIn Dungelot you are given a set of hidden tiles that make up a dungeon floor. You must click on those tiles to find the exit to proceed to the next level. Underneath the tiles can be magic, healing, traps, chests, keys and of course, monsters. You can only clear tiles that are not protected; so you need to work out which tiles you can uncover by killing the monsters with your hero, whilst taking the least amount of damage possible. If you take too much damage, it's game over and you'll have to start a new game. This is why it's compared to Minesweeper; as there's a basic level of strategy that involves working out how many tiles you'll free up with each battle and using that knowledge to pick your fights.\n\nAs strategy games go, it's a casual one, but does have a surprising amount of depth and I'm having a lot of fun with it. Just as much fun as I had on the original game. Just bear in mind that it is more about the RNG, the Roguelike elements, character progression and the strategy of combat. The Minesweeper comparison is fairly superficial. It's a rogue-like-lite (that's a word right?) in that you are pretty much destined to die at first, but with each run you gain gold that you can spend on permanent upgrades that will make the next run easier and easier. Thus, you can progress ever further onwards. Some simple improvements that would make the game better in my personal opinion would be larger dungeons with a lot more tiles and a larger pool of classes with different abilities to add more depth to selection.\n\nThere is a little bit of a delibately trope-filled story and tongue-in-cheek dialogue, with a world map and different kingdoms to conquer. The first zone concludes with you fighting the epic zombie cow, who has turned against the vampire Vlad and over-ran his realm, tired of years of being sucked dry. It includes such classy dialogue as "Moo-ortals!" and other excessive Moo-ing. You start with one class, but can unlock four, each of which has a different strength and weakness, and there's a small amount of strategy involved in choosing your class. Although mostly I found it was just picking the one I had the most fun with.\n\nAnd that's what this game comes down to - it's simple, it's casual, but it's satisfying to play and definitely fun so a thumbs up from me!\nP.S. If you think this level of strategy is just too casual for you to enjoy whilst sitting at the PC, check out the games on iOS, where they really are perfect for short spurts of gaming whilst away from the computer and are full, microtransaction-free games.","February 20","true","7.8"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","22","24","0","0"

From this you can see, in a game you will found three acts.\nIn every acts you will found a dungeons what you should complete. Each dungeon you can explore in a turn based game mechanics what include minesweeper elements. Your goal is to find a key to complete a current floor. When you are discovering a squares, behind some of them you will found nothing, but behind others a different enemies, items and treasures.\nEnemies are very various, some of them have a skills, active and passive aswell, and some of them can "corporate" with other monster at the current floor. Your character have skills, inventory and the stats like health, attack, etc. When you complete a dungeon you can upgrade a stats. Also in a game you will found a trading, crafting, buffs and a lot of different gameplay elements what you will find ina RPG games.\nThe game graphic and style is very nice. Music and sounds also good.\n\nSo my verdict\n\n+nice graphic and style\n+challenging and addictive\n+confirmed funny\n+various enemies and items\n+enough deep gameplay\n+nice sounds and music\n+steam achievements\n\n-no trading cards\n-a bit maybe expensive\n\nSo this game is very nice surprise for me, I dont expected that its can be so funny, challenging and addictive. This game have a very nice style and enough deep gameplay. This game i think can be enjoyable for all genres and ages in one time. If you like this type of games i really strongly can recommend this game for you, but if you are not similar with this, i think also should try this out. Only one thing can a bit keep away a bit from this the price I think. In my point of view its a bit high, but if this game get a some discount can be really must buy!\n\n8.5/10","February 25","true","7.7"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","23","27","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/recommended/403940/","zorder","Zorder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/","2003 products in account","Dungelot: Shattered Lands is a randomly-generated dungeon crawler with a very slight Minesweeper influence thrown into the mix. The game itself has been developed by Red Winter, a two man team, which also developed the previous Dungelot games.\n\nThe game is divided into three different acts and in each act you’ll unlock a new character. The available characters are: the paladin, the one you start with; the vampire, unlocked on Act I; the witch, unlocked in Act II; and the bard, unlocked on Act III. Each act has its own theme to it, its own unique tileset and its own enemy types. The premisse of the game is pretty simple, in each act there is a final dungeon, with a special boss, and it is your task to complete this dungeon and defeat the boss.\n\nThe core: The gameplay and combat is pretty simple and straightfoward and, in this case, I think that simple gameplay benefits the game. Each dungeon has several floors, depending on the difficulty of the dungeon, and each floor is divided in squares, only having one that has been revealed which is the floor exit. To use this exit you need to find the hidden key on this floor. Clicking on one of the squares will use one turn and it will reveal what was in that square. It could be an enemy, it could be a pit, it could be loot or the key you’re looking for.\n\nThis is where the game gives you freedom to maneuver. You can choose to find the key as fast as possible and proceed to the next floor or you can keep exploring and get all the loot there is to find and defeat all the enemies, which grants you a reward. Sometimes you’ll be forced to just find the key and get the hell out of there because you need to reach the end of the dungeon. If you die before completing the dungeon that is it, you have to start over from the first floor. Some dungeons might also contain mini-games that range from having to guess which of 3 chests contains an item to repeating a certain melody played by some statues. If you fail to succeed in these mini-games however, you’ll be punished but, if you choose to do so, you can just proceed to the next floor ignoring this entirely.\n\nThe gold you acquire on the dungeons allows you to buy things like weapons, special items and food. Food is a key component on this game because, each time you go down a floor you’ll consume 1 food, so if you run out of food you’ll start loosing health as you go down the dungeon. One other very important aspect of the game is your armour. Armour allows you to block attacks thus not loosing health but loosing armour instead.\n\nHowever, the gold you acquire isn’t tied to a specific dungeon or level, soon enough you’ll unlock the ability to purchase permanent upgrades that affect all your characters which incentives saving gold during your runs in order to purchase permanent upgrades adding an element of progression to the game.\n\nVerdict:Great collection of tunes\nNeat cartoony art style\nRuns on pretty much anything\nDifferent characters allowing for varied and multiple playthroughs\nPersistent progression\nSimple and clear UI\nThis is an amazing game to play on either long or short sessions and I highly recommend it to any fans of dungeon crawlers, roguelikes, roguelites or whatever.","February 28","true","9.4"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

As it was, the developers had launched an ongoing Twitch event that involved key giveaways; I figured I'd try to snatch a key and see what the fuss was all about.\n\nRed Winter has impressed. Before I comment further on the game itself, allow me to share a quick story. After tabbing through several streams over the span of an afternoon, engaging with streamers and other players alike, I simply hadn't any luck winning distributed keys. I decided to reach out to the Dungelot team on their official Facebook page and inquire into the length of the event, in hopes that they intended to keep it going for a few more days. A mere fifteen minutes after I sent my message, a member of their team responded with gratitude for my interest in the game and four free keys to use for my wife and I, as well as two friends. This isn't something you see very often and it was entirely unexpected (despite the random giveaways that had been done throughout the day). This alone has earned my respect and admiration for Red Winter Software.\n\nThat said, don't be deceived by the colorful animations and quaint humor: this game will challenge you. Sure, as soon as you loot the current floor's key, you can move on whether or not you've cleared the floor but the game is still designed in such a manner as to stack the odds against you. As you're unable to clear tiles adjacent to monsters you've yet killed, it becomes a game of strategy -- more so given the nature of many of the monsters and their de/buffs. Mechanics are not overwhelmingly difficult to learn and while the crafting + vendor system is a bit simplistic, the variation of loot adds a layer of intrigue (and addiction to clearing each floor, I might add).\n\nI'd be remiss if I didn't acknowledge how pleasantly surprised I was with the lore and NPC interactions as well.\n\nFor a dungeon crawler, this is easily my best experience to date and I would wholeheartedly recommend this game. I look forward to adding more to my review as I invest more time into the game but at this very moment, it gets a 10/10 from me.","February 22","true","2.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","1"

You have four characters to play as, each offering a different playstyle. Your goal is to defeat the evil forces and reunite the land, which means going through countless dungeons. The game is rather challenging, sometimes frustrating, but highly addictive. Be ready to die often and make sure to save up your gold!\n\nStoryThe story isn’t a major part of the game. You start off as Owin the paladin who has been tasked with the mission of defeating the creatures of darkness and reuniting the land, long torn apart. Along the way you’ll meet allies, some are unlockable as playable characters. Vlad the vampire, Elsa the witch and Simon the bard join forces with Owin to right wrongs and triumph over evil. It is a bit of a shame the story isn’t very fleshed out but the game is still fun regardless.\n\n\nGameplayWhen I first booted up the game I thought that I might need a controller, however all you need is a mouse to get started. When you get into a dungeon you have a board that you need to click your way through to find a key to progress to the next level. It’s sort of like Minesweeper except you are given no hints about what each block is so it’s all random, just like the dungeons when generated. Clicking on a square can uncover a monster, a spell, food, goodies or the key. Each dungeon level has a certain amount of floors to visit and numerous monsters on each one to fight. There are also hideouts where you can rest every five floors, a few mini games and other nice bonuses. This is helpful since the farther you get into the game the harder it becomes and these safe spots can be lifesavers. The game also has a hunger feature, each level consumes one unit of food.  You can find more food on the floors and also buy some as well but if you run out you begin to starve which depletes your health.\n\nYou can fight monsters using a basic attack, a spell, or an item such as a bomb. All of the characters have four spells each which you unlock during the game, you must also unlock each playable character as well except for the paladin. Knowing when to fight, when not to fight and when to use a spell or item is crucial to surviving, your character starts off with armor that can only deflect a given number of hits and then your HP is affected and each character has different attack strength; sometimes it’s better for a weaker character to use a bomb or just avoid certain fights. There is a nice variety of times to play with that you find throughout the dungeons or you can buy them from the merchant in the dungeons but items do not carry over to the next dungeon. Weapons and armor you find to carry over and there is also a mansion to unlock which is like a home base where you can purchase permanent bonuses.\n\nGraphics/AudioI was first drawn to the gis game because of the graphics before I even know what kind of game it was. They were colorful, crisp and kind of cute. Having played the game I am not at all disappointed. Each character and monster has their own unique look, animations are smooth, backgrounds are well-done, I found everything to pleasing to the eyes. The music is alright, it’s nothing too unique but it’s also not annoying. Each level has fitting background music that did not distract from the gameplay. There is also a little bit of voice acting, the characters say their catch phrases, some monsters squeak or groan, some NPC say a word to two. Nothing major but it certainly does add something to the game.\n\n\nPros+ Very addictive and fun.\n+ Good graphics and audio.\n+ Items, bonuses, traps and such add a good system of checks and balances.\n+ Each level gets increasingly longer adding new challenges.\n+ Steam achievements.\n\nCons- Can be frustrating since you die often.\n- Game becomes a bit of a grind towards the end.\n- No Steam trading cards.\n\nFinal ThoughtsI was pleasantly surprised by this game, it frustrates me often but I can’t stop playing and trying to unlock everything, the Steam achievements are a nice incentive to keep playing as well. I learned that this is apparently a port of a phone app game but I have not played that version nor does that affect this version of the game. While it might seem a little pricey, the game has a good replay value to make it worth it. If you enjoy a good dungeon crawler then I fully recommend this title for your Steam library.\n\n\nRating: 8.5/10\n\nThis review was submitted for Elite Giveaways, check us out for more reviews ranging from Indie games to AAA games to F2P games.\n","May 25","true","21.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/403940/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","I have a new game under the category of ‘favorites’ on Steam. That’s how much I think of Red Winter Software’s Steam debut title, Dungelot: Shattered Lands. I had an inkling during my research of the game that I was going to enjoy this one and it has proven me to be correct. I generally try to avoid allowing myself to have preconceptions about games before I feature them on the site but in this case I found it very difficult. I’m traditionally not a huge fan of Minesweeper which is one of the natural inspirations for this game but I have to admit that that aspect of the game really works for it. The dungeon crawler – action RPG aspects of the game mesh very well to create an interesting game that was able to keep me captivated throughout my playtime.\n\nThe game offers players a very thorough challenge. Although the presentation may make the game appear easier or more hand-holdy than other dungeon crawlers it takes incredible use of strategy to delve deeper and deeper into the game once you have successfully completed the game’s tutorial-like difficulty levels. Players have to advance through a number of floors – varying by the dungeon – in order to advance. You begin with the armor, health and weapons and must search for more otherwise you’ll ultimately lose as enemies become stronger. Generally I notice whenever I gain a new achievement and to my surprise on my first session I was more than a little surprised that I walked away with ten of the fifty two on offer such was the attention that the game itself held for me. I was also a big fan of the art style used both graphically as well as audibly. I felt that both worked to aide the game’s immersion.\n\nIf there were things that I would advise the developers to add to the game I would begin with Steam trading cards. This will help foster a greater purchase base for the game because without a multiplayer aspect you’re not going to get people playing so that they can play with their friends. I feel that trading cards will increase the number of people buying the game. Another extrinsic value that I would like to see is a slight lowering of the price. Don’t get me wrong at $9.99 I feel that the value is there for people like me that would really enjoy the game but for those that are on the fence that price is a tad high especially if you have an ability to purchase the iOS game at $2.99. Another small issue is the UI. It’s a little clumsy and could have been built better. Only minor tweaks need to be made but it would make a world of difference.\n\nDungelot is a game that I know I will return to weeks and months, perhaps even years from now.

Oh yeh, I have a Windows phone and there is about as much support for it as there an existing Steam app. In all seriousness, other than the name being a good joke when describing the game itself, there us some fun times to be had here.\n\nI’m going to start with calling Dungelot a grind. That’s coming off of saying that Battle for Blood wasn’t a true grind. Dungelot is a bit more blatant in its grind… that is unless I’m playing the game wrong.\n\n*An hour or three bits of gameplay later…*\n\nTurns out, yes I was playing it wrong. Dungelot is a item-driven game, but it is more correctly a progress-driven game. What I mean is that you don’t have to fight all the enemies and from what I’ve come to experience, it can actually be better for you if are able to grab all of the loot without encountering any enemies. This is seriously counter-intuitive for the likes of me. This is especially true when you make me a paladin and then have me walk past hordes of undead to beat a dungeon. You simply need to get to the bottom of the dungeon without dying of HP lose or starvation. The kicker is, while you may progress in the game by getting to the end, if you kill everything on a floor you are rewarded with a chest that can have some pretty useful loot. Is this the only way to get certain items? I’m not really sure. I also can’t remember where I got some items and that kind of frustrates me since killing a lot of things in this game is a gamble that I don’t like to take. Who cares if you have a lot of items if you don’t have the HP to make it to the end?\n\nThe first few dungeons or so are rather simplistic and they move up in difficulty quickly (especially if you’re trying to kill a lot of things). You’ll be walking around these RNG’d dungeons trying to get to the last level and while concept sounds easy enough I want to emphasize the “walking” bit. If you go around clicking around all willy-nilly, you will end up regretting it sooner rather than later. There are enemies that benefit greatly from being surrounded by other blocks and some enemies get buffed when you kill others. If you let too many of them gather and you haven’t discovered the key to the door for that level yet, you could be in for some work. There are some baddies that will take damage for other monsters and some that get buffed when you kill other monsters as well. So there may be only one block left and you may have to kill more than just one monster to get there.\n\nNaturally, the more you play, you’ll get a pretty good idea of which ones should be dealt with when you encounter them. There are some that are on my “kill on site” list, but even those enemies are spared sometimes if I don’t need to take the chance. If I can get the key, I’ll just grab it and peace out of the level as quick as possible. Is there a reason for killing things other than a random chance at an item? Kind of… if you like temporary buffs and achievements. I hate to admit it, but I’m a mild fan of both. I’ll probably end up going back through just to finish out some achievements. That will come later though. I’ve got three continents to save from… peril? Well, three main bad guys at least. I’ve also got more of this game to figure out.\n\nScore: Tasty!\n\nDungelot is a genuinely fun game to experience. While I get frustrated with how some encounters/dungeons end, with the way the game is built I know that there was definitely something I could have done differently to save myself. There’s been a few circumstances where I just had some bad luck here and there, but so far the game is rather fair in comparison to other roguelikes. Dungelot has a fun aesthetic going for it making playing and losing an almost pleasant experience. It’s a fun title that most should enjoy as a nice relaxing break from the normal go-go-go of games today. There’s also some endless levels who just fall in love with the gameplay. Not my thing since the devs take 90% of my winnings from there. *Fist shaking!*","February 25","true","6.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

At first you only have one option, but will unlock more by progressing through the game. Each character has their own attributes and skills to allow for variety in gameplay.\n\nThe gameplay itself is quite easy to get into. You click on a tile in the dungeon to uncover what is underneath it. Your main objective is to find the gold key on that floor, and then go onto the next one. Each level will have a set number of floors you need to complete without dying, in order to unlock the next level.\n\nHowever, if you decide to stay on the floor and completely uncover the rest of the tiles, you will be rewarded by finding money, loot and food. This is a kind of risk-reward type of scenario, because you run the chance of taking damage from more enemies you might encounter.\n\nYou attack enemies by simply clicking on them, which will then have them return an attack onto you. The fighting can be strategic if you want it to be. Making sure you have enough armour to protect your actual health, and using certain elemental attacks to take advantage of enemies' weaknesses. There are even small details interesting details like using a bomb on certain enemies will cause them to do damage to you, or bribing a greedy opponent with a certain coin will have them leave. Randomizers like this keep the game interesting.\n\nOccasionally, some floors will be a bit special. You might fight bosses, do a memory challenge, or have an opportunity to trade at a store. You may either use your various found items throughout the dungeon, sell them, or salvage them to build up your charge meter. In doing so, you have a higher chance of having a passive ability activate.\n\nI should mention that the music is really great. It gets you into the world. The charming art style is nice too.\n\nOverall, a really fun game with a lot of replayability. If you're into puzzle games like minesweeper, dungeon crawlers or roguelites, then you'll enjoy this one!","February 19","true","5.1"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","11","17","0","0"

While that sounds like a massive headache it actually works fantastically well and makes for an easy to play yet surprisingly deep and addictive experience.\n\nAlso available on IPad it is actually the third in the Dungelot series. The first not surprisingly called Dungelot was released back in 2013 and was well received on mobile platforms. The sequel Dungelot 2 adopted a F2P model that was slightly less well received. Shattered lands returns to the first games pay upfront model and is largely more successful for it. The difference in prices between versions however is big with the Mobile version coming in at £2.99 or your regional equivalent and the steam version coming in at a considerably more expensive £6.99. Now while this game is definitely worth £6.99 as I am about to tell you I would 100% recommend picking this up on mobile as to be honest I actually found this game perfectly suited to playing on an iPad and actually preferred that version more.\n\nThe core game-play of Dungelot: Shattered Lands sees you explore dungeons made up of a number of different floors where you must find the key on each floor to proceed to the next. This is done by tapping to uncover squares which contain items and monsters. When a monster is uncovered you are unable break any adjacent blocks until it is dead which you may need to in order to search further. You do not have to kill a monster you uncover but if the key has not yet been found you may not have a choice.\n\nMonsters get strong rather quick and often the deck is stacked against you. Monsters almost always attack first, they are littered with battle cries and death rattles and some make other adjacent monsters stronger. Really this game is a roguelike puzzle game and man is it fun.\n\nAs you progress you uncover a variety of different loot that help your adventure. Armour gives you extra buffs and abilities, all important food can be gained to stop hunger setting in as you lose a hunger point each floor, the usual life, armour and attack stats and a number of different offensive items. A personal favourite other item of mine is the lantern that reveals the location of enemies on the floor.\n\nEach of the game characters that are unlocked as you progress also come with a number of different spells. The Paladin for instance has an instant damage or heal spell and the vegan vampire can cast a spell to move a monster to a different location (which is very handy to search nearby blocks without fighting overpowered mobs).\n\nAnother key mechanic comes in the form of salvaging which allows you to destroy an item to gain charge which increases the likelihood of gaining one off buffs and abilities. There is also a mood system in the game but honestly compared to the effect of other things its use is largely unimportant.\n\nEvery 5 floors you enter a merchant and there are other floors mixed in throughout the dungeon with other mechanics. The dungeons are all randomly generated which ensure that each run-through is a new experience.\n\nIn terms of the iPad version (which is by far the more sensible and in my mind better buy) it is a nice change of pace from the f2p offerings currently littering the ipad store. It is a nice change to have a decent difficulty curve and not be met by in game currency nonsense, stupid replenishing stamina and the ability to buy cheats. This is a proper and may I say very challenging game.\n\nThere are a few quality of life issues that I wish could be changed. Due to the nature of how the levels work there is a lot of wasted space at the edge of the screen. Why the inventories are not there as opposed to being on a separate screen is a bizarre move. Also I sometimes wished I had the option of playing as more characters from the start as opposed to unlocking one each act.\n\nOverall though Dungelot: Shattered Lands is a great game the I would say is definitely worth considering on steam but an absolute must buy on iPad largely due to the touch controls being a more preferable way to play and the much more attractive price tag.\n\nA KEY WAS PROVIDED BY THE DEVELOPER FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS REVIEW BUT I AS NOT PAID IN ANYWAY.

However if you don't then get it on pc, it's still worth the money.\n\nThe minesweeper aspect is quite minimal, other than having squares you click and monsters that once uncovered block the squares around it. I think advertising this as a minesweeper meats dungeon crawler is fair but it's not a number based game like minesweeper.\n\nGraphics are cute, they suite the style.\n\nMy worst aspect about this game is easily the item system, it's awful! You need to open your bag, select your bomb, then press use, then select the enemy you wish to attack with the bomb, it's far too many clicks, it really does detract from the game, also when I craft an item it takes ages to finish the animation before you can leave, it's a bit repeitiveand tidious, speically if you craft a few items in a row.

When I saw this had come to Steam I had to check it out.\n\nIt may seem at the surface to be a simple game, but the game packs a lot of strategy.  The strength of the game is the fact that it is very easy to pick up and play.  Gameplay is simply entering a dugeon, traversing each level by clicking to reveal squares.  Your goal is to find the key and then you can leave, but along the way you might find treasure, traps or enemies.  And since the game is turn based, you choose how much you want to explore a level and even how many enemies you want to take on.  Once the key is revealed you are free to leave, but the temptation will be there to unveil every square.  And that is where the strategy comes in, if you try to reveal all the squares and fight every enemy you are likely not to get through the entire dungeon if you aren't careful.  This kind of choice offers a lot of replay-ability for what seems to be a simple game.\n\nAdding; It is a game where you can get a quick round in, but will find yourself many times spending more time then you want to, while enjoying every moment of it.\n\nThe one negative I could point to is that the game does accommodate the touch screen much better then the mouse.  But because of how strong the gameplay is, it's easy to overlook this fact.","March 2","true","4.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

They are kept in captivity in highly dangerous dungeons. Are you up to challenge, my dear Paladin, because it is not going to be easy? Welcome to Dungelot: Shattered Lands!\n\nDungelot: Shattered Lands is an action /RPG / Dungeon Crawler game. At the start of the game, you will have one hero available to you, a Paladin. Later on, you will be able to play as a Vampire, a Witch and a Bard but you will have to beat dungeons and its bosses to unlock them.\n\nAs you enter your first dungeon, it will tell you how many floors it has (some dungeons have more floors than others) and what rewards you will earn if you successfully beat it. Each floor is divided into 25 squares. The door to the next floor will be on one of these square, but it is locked. The aim is to find the key to unlock the door to go to the next floor. How you do that is by clicking on the squares using your mouse and it will reveal what’s on the tile. You are probably not going to pick up the key on the first tile but you might get either a coin, a bag (which always has interesting goodies), a spell, food, or you might get nothing at all! But if you are lucky you will find an enemy. Make sure you pick up as much food as you can, as it will cost you one piece of food each time you go through to the next floor.\n\nIn regards to the combat phase - first of all, if you click on a tile and an enemy appears, you do not have to fight him straight away. In fact you might already unlock the door but if are like me, you might keep looking around in search of additional goodies. If you decide to engage in a battle, you just click on the enemy and it will start the turn-based fighting. Look at your inventory, you might have to pick up bombs, axes, knives and more to throw at your enemy and inflict greater damage. Let me be blunt here, you might die quickly in your first couple of tries. Before re-entering a dungeon, you will be able to use the coins you collect at the Armory to upgrade your hero weapons and armour.\n\nI really like the randomly regenerated dungeons - it will keep you playing for hours and hours on end!\n\nI enjoyed the cartoon graphics and the soundtrack in this game.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Great cartoon graphics\n-	Randomly regenerate dungeons\n-	Good number of enemies and items\n-	Challenging, fun and addictive\n-	Achievements\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	No trading cards\n\n-	I would love to see additional heroes\n\nDungelot: Shattered Lands is definitely a game that should find is way into your game library.\n\n8/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

I’m not big on games that move over from the mobile platform to PC as nine times out of ten they just don’t work for me. Dungelot has been a pleasant surprise in this respect, it’s not all that bad.\nDungelot is described as a hybrid between a dungeon crawler and minesweeper and it’s a pretty accurate description, but it’s far deeper than that. The game is played on a 5x5 grid that’s covered with rocks, as you uncover each square you might find one of a few things. Items, food, enemies or the dungeon key which is perhaps the most important thing, as opening the door to the dungeon takes you to the next floor. Enemies will restrict you from uncovering the squares around them until they are defeated but don’t be tricked into taking on every enemy as this is a quick way to die, rather avoid it if you can. Food is needed for progression as moving to another floor with no food will give you a penalty to your health and items offer a range of benefits to the player like bombs to fight enemies or buff giving potions. Items used correctly can be a life saver and you quickly learn to manage your inventory to match your style of play.\nThe game also has a selection of mini games and diversions to partake of which pop up as you quest, these are a nice little extra that keeps things fresh. All in all it’s an enjoyable experience to play with a fair bit of humour in the narrative too and while I’m not a huge fan of puzzle games which I would consider this to be I have found myself playing quite regularly. It also helps that the art is pretty good in its cutesy anime style, I’m a sucker for good artwork.\nThe heart of Dungelot is a mobile game no doubt, but it’s not a mobile game that needs you to keep playing every hour to collect something or do something, there aren’t even micro-transactions and this helps to make the experience a pleasurable one. I’m not being forced to play or strong armed into spending money, I can hop in as and when I please and have a quick blast. It doesn’t matter if I played an hour ago or a week, which probably makes me play it even more.\nIt’s not a hard game to understand, it’s a simple puzzle game that’s all about having a bit of fun. It’s enjoyable and the fact it came out on mobile first really doesn’t matter as this is just a puzzle game that happens to have been on mobile, it looks great and plays great on PC instead of being a bad port of a bad game which is what I’ve come to think of when I talk about mobile ports. There’s no earth shattering graphics or gameplay that reinvents the wheel, it’s a colourful, bright and fun little game that I highly enjoyed.\n","February 29","true","10.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

High framerates (120-144+) are supported. Character animations & effects, pans & zooms, mouse cursor movement, attack and various UI animations all looked great at 120Hz. Resolution only adjustable via launcher (no on-the-fly window size adjustment) but alt-enter toggling and alt-tab work fine.\n\nMeant for touch inputs but swiping only works on one screen. Hover doesn’t have any visual effect outside of the descriptions of skill descriptions (missing from status effects). Right clicking is used on monsters for their info pop-ups. Hotkeys were implemented, but the only useful one is Esc for backing up through menus; no other keys can be used to navigate. Mid-dungeon they're all spread out (1-4/C/I) and are of little use. A more logical layout could be ASZX matching the 2×2 skill UI, C left for crafting, and D and/or Shift for inventory. Opening and closing menus with keys is inconsistent, and some even queue inputs. I’m fine with an interface entirely for just clicking, but if you’re going to make the effort to add hotkeys, it would be nice if they worked properly.\n\nIt doesn’t utilize the horizontal space well at all. Depending on your run, you might make consistent use of items. Inventory in a pop-up means each item use requires an additional click, on top of two clicks to just view your items while it covers 40% of the play grid. The crafting menu is a click deep, and clicking blank space to cancel actions is inconsistent. There’s enough unused space to fit the inventory, crafting, volume/save/quit options all at once, but instead it's all in pop-ups. What was an already immensely click-heavy title, is made even more so. It’s required for mobile, but on PC it just lowers the speed of play and forces unnecessary player inputs.\n\nGameplay\nIt was initially advertised with the term "minesweeper", but that was removed recently, and I can see why. The similarities end at clicking a grid to reveal positive or negative outcomes. It’s a shame because not only do I love logic oriented games, I feel such an approach could have made the game vastly more interesting. Outside of following the idea that squares with the fewest uncovered squares surrounding should be uncovered first, as enemies lock said uncovered squares, there’s no strategy involved in revealing the grid. It’s just a click-fest until you’re forced to eliminate an enemy, or you find the key to open the door to the next floor.\n\nCheck full review for far more on mechanics; it's way above the character limit. Put simply: There's a 4 characters (2-3 more coming), tons of items/enemies/traits, a number of optional rooms/mini-games. There's a lot to manage and consider, but the core of play is pure RNG, which is often boring and unfair as a result.\n\nPresentation\nDesigns aren't very unique, but the visual style is cohesive and well executed. The characters/enemies are made up of many elements that squish around nicely, on top of their attack/damaged animations. This gives a dynamic feel to a title that could have been completely static; the same can be said for the UI transitions, and it all looks great at a high framerate. There are also a few comedic bits of written dialogue between the characters at the beginning, end, and upon reaching each of the regions.\n\nThe game progresses through 3 different regions with their own tilesets and additional enemies that fit each theme. An additional ice realm is teased after the final boss, and is confirmed to be coming at some point in a free update.\n\nWhile the ambient music is nothing I’d listen to, I’d say it fits the aesthetic and does change to suit each environment and the menus. Almost every interaction and object motion has a sound effect, the most used having multiple variations, along with subtle changes between the regions. Characters have voice acting; 4-5 lines when selected in the menu, and a few for various events like passive skill triggers.\n\nConclusion\nThe art, animation, and visual presentation are very well done. There’s tons of items and enemies with traits to consider that play into each other, but the core play consists of a lot of meaningless clicking, made worse by a UI meant for mobile devices which forces unnecessary inputs. There’s little to no strategy for clearing the floor tiles, so whether or not you’re forced into fighting is completely random, on top of the random generation failing to create truly compelling encounters. You learn the enemy traits to clear floors quickly while avoiding the actions that will punish, not because there’s any time element, but just because you want to get through it faster. There are key items for the characters that are locked behind playthroughs that are already way too long to begin with.\n\nI’m not the target audience for this title, but I’m sure some will enjoy it. I don’t feel it’s strategic or deep enough to really dig your teeth into, but the presentation is great, and I’ve sunk more time into titles far worse than this on mobile in the past. I appreciate that the title is on PC, but other than the high refreshrate support, it doesn’t really take advantage of the screen real  estate or input methods the PC allows for (slowing play considerably), while also being a title far more suited to the smaller bursts of casual play often seen on mobile. The PC version is also $10 with the iOS release at $4.\n\nAmong a few small bugs, there’s a significant issue with a number of achievements not triggering properly. There’s quality and good bit of content here, but I can only recommend it to those looking for a more casual dungeon crawling experience (not that it isn’t hard, but that the game is heavily reliant on RNG where mathematics/puzzle-solving would have been more suited) to be played in shorter bursts, and are okay with A LOT of clicking. I might have thought more highly of it had I played the 100 Floor Twitch Challenge build, or simply stopped sooner. Playing through till the final boss for review (still only ~25-40% of true completion), I found it tiring.","March 5","true","18.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aegeri/recommended/403940/","aegeri","Aegeri","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aegeri/","110 products in account","This is an interesting mix of genres, with something approaching a light RPG with what amounts to a weird version of minesweeper. Each level of the Dungelot, you get a series of dungeon tiles that you need to dig out to find a key in order to exit to the next level. Sometimes under the tiles you might find items, pits or rather frequently, monsters. These monsters work like a reverse minesweeper, preventing you from uncovering the tiles they are adjacent to until they are defeated. The trick is that unlike normal RPGs, the monsters strike first and you have only a limited pool of armor and health. So there is a fine line between digging tiles, killing monsters and trying to exit to get to the next floor as soon as you can.\n\nGenerally speaking, this is actually a pretty fun mix and the game has an incredibly goofy, but quite charming, sense of humor. The first boss of the game is basically a gigantic zombie cow, whose only expression is basically a zombie moo equivalent. Unfortunately, I think the game does have some flaws and one of them is in the incredibly poor feedback during combat. Sometimes things just seem to happen, resulting in you losing health/armor from a fight, but seemingly not damaging or bothering the enemy that much. Usually this is because the enemy has dodge or your weapon has a miss chance, but there isn't good feedback as to why something happens. So you can click on something and discover that you've lost quite a bit of health, because the combat animations play so indistinctly and without giving a good indication what happened.\n\nAdditionally the game was recently patched adding a further complication, where some tiles can give you bonuses or (much more rarely) rewards if you dig them fast enough. A good example are the tiles that if you break, buff all the enemies in the area quite substantially for a period of turns. Similarly, there's a buff that if you reach fast enough can improve your attacks, but I will say these buffs are rare. The detrimental effects spawn much more commonly and this has greatly increased the games difficulty in places. Generally speaking, it's a bit counter intuitive, but there's not much of an incentive to engage with enemies if you can until the lowest levels of the dungeon you're on. Picking fights too early can cripple you towards the end, especially in the longer dungeons that can have 20+ floors to them.\n\nOverall I think this is an entertaining and fun little distraction that I come back to for a while when I feel like playing something fairly light.","April 12","true","4.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's not a bad port, though. There are a few moments when it feels like a mobile game, but they are few and far in between. There is a lot to talk about here so lets get at it...\n\nPROS:\n1) Dungelot takes an idea from Minesweeper (yes, the original windows title from 1989) and it quite gracefully builds on the long forgotten game mechanic.\n\n2) Art in Dungelot is really well polished. Extremely polished, actually. The whole game has been buffed to such an extremely bright shine that it is probably as good as you can get from a 2D game with bonebased animations.\n\n3) The game feels good in large bites or in nibbles. You can play for 10 minutes or an hour and have fun. This design in this regard is pretty clearly for the "mobile" market, but games like this have a home on PCs too. Not all of us have the time (or attention span) to dedicated 4-5 hours in one sitting for Dota2 or something.\n\n4) Gameplay is easy to learn and fun to play through. There is nuance and some tactical layers hidden under it's simplicity, but it isn't like Othello or Go, games that are classically "quick to learn, slow to master".\n\nCONS:\n\n1) As a mobile port the game is quite simplified. Perhaps too simplified for the PC, though. Clicking on everything is remeniscent of touch-screen gameplay and that at times can actually hurt the game. Complexity is not a virtue within it's own right, but just as a hammer doesn't need a wifi connection, but does well with the prybar to pull screws... Dungelot feels like a hammer without the prybar.\n\n2) Menu Navigation is clumsy at times. When trying to vew my hero, i can accidentally click back to the main menu without realising how I did so. There is some nuance lost when porting to PC.\n\n3) UI design is also...lacking. Opening up the "backpack" feels like a chore and simply "adds clicks" without adding depth. The bag only allows 4-6 slots and you can fit all 6 of them on the UI without much worry. This makes the whole "backpack" kind of a clumsy addition.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nI really like Dungelot. I am willing to say that for a PC port it is actually a fairly solid one and almost everything I see wrong with the game can be patched. I do hope that the developer cares enough about the PC community to patch the game with some PC appropriate fixes, but there is no way to know for sure. As I play the game I enjoy my experience and the little details that I may nitpick are overshadowed by what Dungelot does really well: feel fun to play. Over all it is a surprisingly well rounded game. It is a game that anyone can get into and enjoy and I think it deserves to be in the library of both casual and semi-serious gamers. Hardcore players will always have Dark Souls to enjoy, but games like Dungelot are great for everyone else. And that is the majority of gamers.\n\nPurchased this at full price and feel very content with the 9.99 USD price point.","March 21","true","26.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game is simple enough to play, but can be fairly difficult sometimes. The game also has some very interesting mechanics that other games don't usually have. There are at the moment only 4 characters, although you really have to work hard in order to unlock them and play as them.\n\nGameplayDungelot: Shattered Lands is like no other rogue-like, dungeon crawler type of game. It has some really interesting mechanics tied into the game that really make this game unique and fun to play. First of all let's talk about the way that the game is played.\n\nHow the game is played\nBasically your objective of each run is to get to the last floor and defeat the final boss in order to proceed. On each floor you are given a grid (5x5) and you will be at the door. You will be able to click on a tile to reveal what is on it, this could be a enemie, gold, a sack with a item or prehaps someone helpful. You're objective on each floor is to get the key, which is under one of the random squares in the grid, and get out of the floor to get to the next floor and the next until you get to the end. However, although this sounds easy and simple there are a few problems that you will most probably encounter throughout the game. First thing to worry about is your hunger, each time you go a floor you will lose one food. Although you can survive with no food and going down a floor, you will take some damage, so stacking food may be necessary for your survival. Along with the food that you will need, there are also enemies that you will encounter along your way. Because what is any rogue-like without it's enemies? At first you will find a very small amount of enemies that you might encounter, skeletons, bats and rats. But as you get into the other acts, there will be new enemies suited to that specific enviroment. These enemies will stand in your way, and will not let you proceed to certain blocks which may or may not have the key or something else under them. Killing them is essiential if you don't already have the key and there are no other tiles to look under. The combat system is turned based, so make sure you use your moves wisely. Although you can use as many items as you want and that will not count as your turn over. You can also find spells that will help you attack the enemie, and in some cases will heal you or do other things that might come in useful. The final thing that you will have to worry about is the traps that occur a little later in act I, these traps will be seeable, and will last a certain amount of turns until they are gone. Sometimes this cna leave you in a tricky situation whereby you are forced to step on a trap in order to obtain the key.\n\nThe good & bad\nThis game does so well by means of making you play just one more game until you have finally finished that one area. I'm not sure if it is just me, but this game can be fairly difficult at times. It took me about 6ish hours to complete Act I. The game is really addictive and really draws you in. I really like how unique this game is compared to other rogue-like games out there. This to me is something completely new and different to other games of the similar genre. I really like the way you play through the game, the way that most things are randomly generated and you never know where anything is until you reveal the tile you want to step on. There is a little bit of strategy involved in this game, you can salvage items to increase your bar at the bottom which will then increase the power of your spells. This is a new way of getting rid of junk you don't really need, instead of selling it to the next shop you might find you can increase the power of your spells which is way more useful. The only downside to this game that I found is that it can be rather fustrating sometimes you continously die on the same level over and over again.\n\nArt StyleThe cartoonish like style to this game is really suiting the way that this game is played. Along with the story of the game, which as you would expect isn't too serious, this cartoon like feel to the game really fits in with the sort of casual way you play the game. All of the enemies and characters you meet look really nice and polished up, giving them that really nice look that most cartoon art styled games should have. The characters of the game seem to be really well animtated and produced much like the enemies are, but with a little more detailed payed attention to.\n\nMusic & SoundThe music of this game is really suiting to where you are in the game. The title screen is a little creepy music that fits really well with the dark and gloomy colours of the castle in the background. It really does set the mood of the game to be one of them games that will keep you playing over and over again even if you keep dying. The sounds are fairly unique to each of the enemies that attack you, and the way that each character you play as has their own different sound to them. It is obvious that the developers really put a lot fo time and effort into making this game.\n\nConclusionThis is a solid rogue-like dungeon crawler game. Very unique and fun to play, it is also a great time killer if you are looking for one of them games that you want to play for a little bit. The art style and music are both really suiting to this type of game, the enemies are well balanced with each level they get increasingly difficult. Each character has their different strengths weaknesses so that you can play differently, although you will need to work hard to gain access to them.\n\nFor more reviews on a wide range of games, go and follow Lot's O Giveaway's curator group here.","March 18","true","9.9"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

I bought mobile Dungelot: Shattered Lands on day-one and have no buyer's remorse.  Certainly worth full price.  I was elated when I saw a steam version.  BUT....I cannot recommend this one.  To max out DSL, you must play all 3 acts with all 4 characters.  Presently, I've died 56 times on one level,  I cant get past the first level of Act III.  Playing on Windows 10, the game is just broken.\n\nPlaying as the paladin (the first character), the Holy Light spell damages fiends but does not heal the character.  Out of 12 casts, the Hammer of Justice spell only stunned a fiend one time (should be 50% of the time).  Once you buy the additional bomb achievement in the mansion, I got one additional bomb after eight crafting attempts (supposed to be 50% chance to get an additional bomb).  These percentages are when I started counting.  The Winged Boots artifact, only gives me initiative on the level that I discovered the boots then no longer works.  I'm suspicious that other artifacts dont work after the level they are found on.\n\nEven though it's broken,I kept playing because I like DSL on mobile iOS.  I can get past the game's shortcoming and emerge victorious.  But...."the straw that broke the camel's back."  One "randomly" generated level, had monsters (i revealed them with a lantern) and damaging traps in every tile around the starting block plus the next level of tiles.  I wished I screen shot it because it was completely unwinnable.  Tiny Build/Red Winter needs to go back the drawing board and make this a littlea  more playable game.  Just port the iOS version it's perfect.\n\nGraphics 9/10\nAudio 9/10\nControls/UI 9/10\nImmersion 7/10\nGrind Level 10/10\nReplay Value 2/10\nOverall fun 2/10","April 2","false","71.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

There's an alternate puzzle experience here that does make some sense with comparisons to minesweeper, as enemies need to be avoided more then they needed to be hit over the head with the hammer of justice. Which at first works, as when the game breaks down to “how do I get to the key without taking damage”, it works. But it can't keep it up, as there's not enough variety to keep the interest over a period of time, and the lack of reasons to actually engage the enemy means that things get boring quickly. With games like Runestone Keeper offering more content at the same price, it's hard to justify, especially when the IOS version is only 4 bucks, and the Steam version isn't exactly programmed to take advantage of the platform. Only a few skills, a few heroes, and where there is variety,  it's not necessarily used in the best of ways. Honestly, the game can turn into a grind.\n\nLists:\n+:\nPuzzle wise, the basics of trying to find the key of the stage and getting out of dodge does work if you look at the game as an optimization problem. AKA, what's the easiest way for me to get a key without taking damage.\nProvides a challenge.\nI like the humor with the minimal storytelling here.\nEnemy traits are implemented reasonably, with alternate mechanics that force some strategies.\nBosses definitely have a visual impact, a nice change up.\nVisually appealing. Good character designs that are colorful, and there's nice little jokes thrown in here and there from popular culture.\n-:\nCompletely unjustified price compared to the iOS version. The PC version has no significant improvements that really justify it, in fact, it's missing basics with keyboard controls. Menus are awkward from the Steam platform.\nThe avoiding of enemies can get rather boring, and is necessary to play that way due to a lack of health/etc. It turns the game into the same thing over and over again.\nThe dungeons do feel too long in several cases. Not difficulty wise, but really just from an overall length argument: it doesn't keep up the gameplay well enough, even from the endurance standpoint.\nWhen compared to a game like Runestone Keeper, it's just lacking in terms of variety for weapons, skills, etc. For a 10 dollar game on Steam, it just didn't keep it going the way it needed to.\nYou're probably wondering why I played the game for so long then. Well, I wanted to get to the mage to see if it played that much different from everyone else. She plays a little bit differently, but not that different. Sorta disappointed in character differences.","February 20","false","11.0"," 29 of 62 people (47%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","47","29","62","3","5"

So.....I called up Dungelot and we plan on haivng a little get together for some Minesweeper/Rouglike/Strategizing and we set out to meetup. Here's a breakdown of what happened that fateful night....\n\n1) So for the first few dungeons I thought it was a good start but could not wait for some of the deeper underlying mechanics to spring forth. Sure Dungelot isn't here just yet but I have only just arrived right?\n\n2) Several dungeons later I am looking at my watch and messages to make sure I am in the right meeting spot and that Dungelot knows to meet me here for strategy. Check and check and I am little concerned now as it is strange of Dungelot to be running so late.\n\n3) A few more hours after that I realized I have been stood up and sent on a blinddate with a facebook game from browsertown hell bent on killing time and wasting lives. Desperate now I search and search but the game I wanted never existed and I realize I have been Bamboozled. Hope is lost. Despair. End Scene.\n\nSo I really wish there more to this game but the gameplay breaks down as this....\n\n1. Choose Character and Basic Unintersting Stats and Skillsets\n2. Enter Dungeon\n3. Click on Blocks\n4. Choose From Uninteresting Skills or Click on Monsters to Advance\n5. Choose between One-Dimensional Stats to Improve\n6. Risk Easily Acquired Gold to Improve Further\n7. Improve without effort\n\nNumero 7 is the issue for me....this is really just a time waster without much depth behind it. A shame as I feel as if there are numerous intersting mechanics that are dying to be applied here.\n\nNow for the good parts!\n\nArtstyle - Thematic and done well though not my thing\nCentral Concept - Ripe for explotiation and development please someone take it and RUN\nuhmmm........Not to expensive? $10 bucks and I got close to my 1 dollar per hour spent rule of Thumb\n\nK I'm done there.\n\nRating 3/10 - Really not much to this timeslot machine you just sit down than insert time...insert time...insert time.....insert time.....BING! Success!\n\nA CASUAL game is the most accurate description of this title if you want to place genre (that's not a genre? well it is now). If you want more of a game than farmville I would sugest you casually walk on past because there is nothing to get excited about here.","April 8","false","9.1"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","1","5","0","0"

I can't recommend it though in its current state.\n\nFirst the good.  The art style is fantastic.  From the characters to the bosses to the tiles everything is very detailed and beautiful.  Animations are very well done.  The level of challenge seems decently balanced.  You can make choices that really hinder your progress or that make the game relatively easy.  It's not too difficult but not too easy for the average player.\n\nThe bad, however, heavily outweighs the good.  Itemization feels very unbalanced.  One of the first unlockable weapons has such powerful abilities that it will carry you through the entire game.  Halving damage and parrying are infinitely more powerful than a 1 in 20 chance of a modest effect, especially when your damage is tied more to your character itself than the weapon's damage.  Add the fact that the later weapons are two-handed, which incurs an accuracy penalty and sacrifices the ability to use shields, and they are all but worthless.  Armor is similar.  You can fight through the most difficult dungeons to obtain character specific armor that once again gives modest effects, only to discover the more easily obtainable armor is superior.  This could all change if proc chances were much higher, but as it stands be prepared for let downs on discovering new items.\n\nThe quest system doesn't make sense at times.  You have 3 quests active at a time, and those quests change depending on the area you are in.  When you complete a quest a new one takes its place until all quests are exhausted.  It can be confusing and annoying to kill 30 goblins and have a quest pop up to kill 30 kobolds, only to find out that the kobolds you already killed don't count.  The kobolds in the next act won't count either, as quests are not global.  The quests do not have a counter, so you have to count them yourself or just be surprised.    Global quests or simply listing all of the areas' quests from the start would go a long way toward alleviating this issue.  Of course there's also the bug of some quest achievements not registering at all once you've completed them.\n\nThe game is simply riddled with bugs.  None that I have encountered have been game breaking, ie corrupting, but they are enough to make the average player move on.  Some bugs are benign, such as bomb upgrades not working until you restart the game.  Others range from confusing to very annoying.  If you are fast clicker you may find yourself frequently exiting dungeons or restarting when bugs won't let you click tiles or your dungeon is a solid black screen.  Maybe you'll get lucky though and recreate the infinite crafting bug or the bug that allows your Paladin to have first strike and infinite spells for the entire dungeon.\n\nSadly this game has all the signs of a money grab iport.  If you have a lot patience, then this game can be very enjoyable.  Otherwise give it a pass or watch to see if the devs fix the problems.","February 22","false","55.6"," 7 of 18 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","7","18","0","0"

Way too many clicks to perform an action. For the first hour or two, you don't really mind but afterwards it's very annoying.\n2-The progression in the game is also problematic, the availability of new Armors and Weapons  has no logic. I've been playing for hours and I'm still ONLY at the second Armor, all of the other Armor are still unavailable. On the weapons side, I'm offered the last weapon of the list but not some of the ones before ??? Why ?\n3-It gets very difficult very fast.\n4-Getting Gold takes way too much time. And at the end, I was going into the mazes clicking whatever only to get gold, I didn't mind about dying, I just wanted to get gold to get better weapons (and other options) just to get by some of the difficult mazes.\n\nOverall, the game has a lot of potential but a lot of problems needs to get fix. The game is unpolished and I'm already tired of not progreesing (because it's too hard).\n\nI suggest to buy this game in a few months when they'll have fixed all these issues.

The game offers enough variety to stay interesting for quite a long time and the pace that it unlocks new content is just right.\n\nThe presentation of the game is cartoon-ish and well made. The sounds and voices suit the setting. The graphics have a distinguished style. There is a certain humour in the writing and it doesn't try to be too funny, but adds a nice amount of silliness to the game.\n\nThe main game mechanic (clicking on blocks to uncover what they hide) is clearly 'borrowed' from Minesweeper, but the game play is entirely different. If you want to buy this game to play a fantasy version of Minesweeper you will be fairly disappointed.

If you dont let the animations play out more often than not the game will not realise the action/crafting/item use has occured and occasionally will just completely put the game in an alt+f4 required standstill.\n\nThe bosses of the normal dungeons are an extremely big let down as more often than not normal mobs in the dungeon will be stronger than the bosses, for example in act 2 one of the dungeons was 25 floors and contained some things including a 2/11 big orc fellow with a few abilitys and effects. Whereas the "boss" at the end of the dungeon was a bat with 2/7 with nothing special about it at all.\n\nThe inventory also annoyed me fairly signigicantly. The game has basic hotkeys eg 1-4 for the 4 abilitys. However the inventory items are hidden in your pack, and require opening and selecting via the mouse to use. Alot of the screen is wasted as black space and could be well utilized to keep your inventory constantly on your screen, however since this game seems very IOS designed I believe that is probably the reason why it was done this way.\n\nThe crafting as well could do with a way to skip the animation or the capability to craft multiple of the same thing at once as it is quite time consuming sometimes and also frequently broke the game because I accidently left the crafting screen "early"\n\nAside from the problems above, I do however recommend this game wholeheartedly.\n\n","March 5","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game offers enough variety to stay interesting for quite a long time and the pace that it unlocks new content is just right.\n\nThe presentation of the game is cartoon-ish and well made. The sounds and voices suit the setting. The graphics have a distinguished style. There is a certain humour in the writing and it doesn't try to be too funny, but adds a nice amount of silliness to the game.\n\nThe main game mechanic (clicking on blocks to uncover what they hide) is clearly 'borrowed' from Minesweeper, but the game play is entirely different. If you want to buy this game to play a fantasy version of Minesweeper you will be fairly disappointed. That being said the game play is a solid rogue-like that offers enough variety and strategic decisions to stay interesting for a longer time.\n\nOverall the game is very well made and balanced. The only problem is the price point of 10$ which is a bit too much for what the game has to offer.

The only similarity is that you click on tiles to reveal them.\n\nLikes:\n- Casual, relaxing fun\n- Provides a decent sense of progress: there are characters, items, skills, recipes, and bonuses to unlock; artifacts to discover; stats to upgrade; quests to do.\n- There are endless-mode dungeons\n\nDislikes:\n- Very casual, no depth, barely any strategy.  The extent of the strategy is basically just deciding which enemies to kill and which to skip, and deciding how to kill the enemies that you do decide to kill (attack, spells, or items).\n- A bit monotonous\n- After all the enemy types have been introduced, the way the difficulty increases is by giving enemies more health and attack power.
