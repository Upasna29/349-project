If not, you may want to try playing SimpleRockets to give you the basics or read up on the terms online. You will need to know what these mean.\n\nTo begin, this is an awesome game. You can travel within a solar system using several modes of propulsion. You can orbit planets and go to space stations. You can mine asteroids and shoot at things with a ship of your own design. You can do all of this in sandbox mode (it will give you things you need from a sandbox menu) or not (in which case you better know what you are doing). I really suggest using the sandbox mode until you are comfortable navigating and modifying your spaceship.\n\nI haven't tried muliplayer yet but I did start my own instance of a server so I can experiment in. Set a password you will remember so you are the only one to get into your instance. In this mode you are given a ship and are in orbit around a planet randomly spawned. Read the F1 help text carefully as it will get you familiar. Anything you need to build or remove from your ship is done in engineering.  You can build and destroy engines, power sources, solar panels, , reactors, corridors, cargo holds, command decks, struts, fuel tanks, a radar system, various weapons, a grapple hook, and a mining laser.\n\nBefore you can use the object, it must be either connected to a power source or a tank. That's done easily by dragging and dropping nodes from the source to the object. You can connect multiple objects to a single tank or power source but remember you will empty that source faster if you do. Adding more sources of fuel or power will help, but it will increase the mass of your ship which will make it slower to turn.\n\nMoving around a solar system is not a simple manner of pointing your nose at a planet, star or asteriod and then firing your rockets because everything including you is in Newtonian motion. It's like trying to drive a car on ice. You have to kill one direction of motion before attempting to move in a new direction (retrograde burns come to play here) or slow down or speed up at the apogee or perigee points of your orbit. Failure to do this will result in your ship skidding and slidding off course.\n\nFor a game that is in alpha, it is very stable. The game cost is insanely reasonable and there is a lot of play value provided you get past the learning curve. There's very little tutorial info here about the game to explain all the basics but two guides written and available on Steam will help you get started. If you keep in sandbox mode, experiment with ship design and orbital mechanics, and ask questions in the community area, you should get the hang of it.\n\nOne  thing I would like to see added as  a feature is the clicking of planets to show info on your approach vector (both tangent and radial). You can do this with asteroids but not planets.\n\nA ship editor for creating and modifying a library of ship designs before entering the game would be great as well.\n\nTime dialation for up to 8x speed is not enough to see a discernable change in orbits and intrasolar system travel...perhaps 24 would be more appropriate?\n\nBuy the game! For 3 cups of coffee you get something that will keep you entertained yet challenged for days.","September 17, 2015","true","22.6"," 30 of 33 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","30","33","0","0"

Perhaps, several tries :-)\n\nI'll be honest, your first times playing this will be confusing and possibly even frustrating. As everyone rushes to point out, the game is not finished and in extremely active development (more on that later). Eventually though, you get the hang of how everything works and it will be smooth flying from then on.\n\nIt may be smart to tick the "sandbox" option the first few times so that you can first in peace check out the many options this game gives you, as well as figure out where some of the things you need are hidden.\n\nThe game at its current stage (version 0.692 just came out as I'm writing this) is simple. You're in command of a space ship and you'd like to, well, not die. Or maybe you do want to die. It's your choice. You start in a reasonably safe orbit around a planet, along with several meteors and two space stations. You can mine the meteors for resources and you can trade with the space stations for food (so your crew doesn't starve). Other than that you're completely free, there's not really a story or objective at this time.\n\nAbout the development: I'm a huge fan of these devs. They are super responsive to anything and everything you post on their Steam page's forums, they actively deal with bugs, discuss ideas and future plans ..and they speak funny English :-) To be frank you'll notice this in the game as well but it's all perfectly understandable.\n\ntl;dr? SUPPORT the awesome people working on this game, be a part of the seemingly small community and make a difference in the development of this already very good game with the potential to be AWESOME.\n\nCelestial Command is worth it","October 21, 2015","true","103.8"," 26 of 27 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","26","27","0","0"

This isn't your typical arcade/causal nonsense - the game is as sophisticated as the games I was raised on and it takes realistic space to a whole new level.\n\nBe advised that the game is still in early development and is nowhere near fully playable.

Even though the game is at a very early stage in development a lot of the really important features are there to enjoy.\n\nAt this stage in development you can free build whatever ship your heart desires. Want to build a small mining ship to collect everything in the solar system, or what about a battleship to kill everything that comes across your path? All of this and much more can be built. The building mechanics themselves are intuitive and easy thanks to a snap in style feature. You can easily see what components will snap in to a given space and if you have any free points left. The only complaint I have to building is the unintuitive linking feature the modules use to become operational. Now, the feature isn’t bad in any right, in fact I love that everything has to be connected to work. My issue is that I have nothing to show me how or what to link in order to activate the module. Of course this issue can be easily fixed with a small tutorial for the game.\n\nAfter playing the game for a while I discovered the physics to be very well done. If you are familiar with any type of realistic orbital mechanics then you will feel right at home. If you are not then it may take some getting used to. The mechanics remind me a lot of Kerbal Space Program and at times Celestial Command feels like a 2D version of it. Of course in my case this is a good thing. The realistic mechanics give the game a welcomed challenge and add another layer of fun and experimentation.\n\nThe overall design of the game is great from what I have seen up to this point. Although the game is being made in a 2D space the design is crisp and well done. When playing in HD all the textures and models look great. I will definitely look forward to seeing more from the team.\n\nOverall I would say development is coming along nicely. Of course you can see that at the time of this review the game has just released. With that being said, even at its current state the game is well worth the price. If you are looking for a fun game in which you truly free build any ship, fly through realistic space physics to kill and mine then what are you waiting for?\n\n\nIt should go without saying but this is a review for the current EARLY ACCESS version of the game. If you buy the game it is at your own risk.","November 23, 2014","true","4.1"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","19","21","0","0"

So far only 6 reviews have been placed. Meaning, probably not many players have this game or know about it.\n\nFor anyone thinking of buying the game, i'll explain to you why you should.\n\nThe price The price of when buying while it's still early access, is just 7,99 EUR. Not so sure about other currencies. This isn't much. When it's fully released, it will be doubled If im right\n\nGameplay The gameplay is very smooth. Especially for an early access title. The amount of things you can do is pretty limited at the moment, but of what the developers have told us, this will be much more fun to play. Don't get me wrong. I'm already enjoying this alot.\n\nWhat im excited about the most, is the amount of updates and the developer-community relationship. The developers actually view the discussions, reviews and questions. And update the game according to what the people want to see.\n\nMy personal favorite will be multiplayer.\n\nAnd while im at it, will there be planet interactions? Something i would really love to see is being able to inhabit a planet and build al kinds of structures on it. Miners, defence systems, that kind of stuff. And automated transporting between those planets using actual npc ships or something. Gives the player the feeling of power and accomplishment.","November 25, 2014","true","5.2"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","19","21","0","0"

Here is what i have so far\n\nPros:\nº This game is fun (for at least a few hours untill you completely give up and decide to crash your crew into the sun like i did which is also fun)\nº The graphics at the moment are nice. no real problem or lag.\nº I like how you can pretty much make your ship and add stuff like weapons, power sources,  and other miscellanious things to it.\nº the Keybinding and every thing else works good, so you can change the keys to fit your playstyle (unlike other developers that dont let you keybind or make it impossible to do so because of an unfixable game crash.)\nº can play with my friends pretty easily, i dont know if it'll be that way in the future though, most steam games started out with easy to make servers, but eventually become tedious and anoying when they start making you port forward, and blahh! blahh! blahh!.\n\nCons:\nº Their has to be a better or easier way to harvest the space rocks, i often find myself crashing into them and now im at the point where i just play sanbox only and i give myself the ores and all i ever do is fly around in space untill i run into another planet or space rock.\nº Nothing to do at the moment. Just fly around. and crash ur crew into the sun.\nº The game gets really super ♥♥♥ laggy when i make a really big ship.\nº And getting from on point to the other is teadious as well, its takes forever to get to my space station.\n\nMy End resolution:\nThis isnt the type of game that i play for hours and hours at a time, its fun to come back to it and do som ship building in a while but shure needs more development. Non the less it keeps me coming back to build and crash my crew into the sun. so im giving this a thumbs up because its fun in some way and i want other to see this game as a new possibility, and i dont want to discourage the devs, it shure is  a fun game  and it needs to get more developed. I also dont want to crash my crew into the sun anyymore so its also for a selfish ambition to do something else.","February 29","true","2.4"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","13","13","3","0"

I like what they’re trying to achieve and with time I’m sure we’re going to get a great space sandbox with a unique focus on realism. However, the game at the moment has a huge learning curve and while I appreciate that the game is going to change a lot throughout its development and as such tutorials would quickly become useless I feel the game is just too complicated (not in a bad way to make clear) to make sense of in a reasonable amount of time, KSP is a good comparison in that while its tutorials were badly outdated at the point I bought it still allowed me to get a good grasp on how to play. Another point of concern for me is the writing in game, I know the dev team don’t speak English as their first language and appreciate that fact but the game is filled with spelling mistakes (It is still readable though) and I think it could really benefit from having someone give it a quick check.\n\nTo make very clear I’m sure my view will change with future updates ( my review will also be updated) but I can’t in its current state recommend people buy it.","August 27, 2015","false","8.6"," 25 of 36 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","25","36","0","0"

It's pretty great.

Well you've only got about 1 minute of thrust left, total, and it's going faster than you around the sun.\nYou'll need to slow down and widen your orbit so it can catch up to you, and you can reserve fuel.\nThat sort of thing!\n\nAt the moment you collect resources to build modules for your ship, sell excess for funds to buy food for your crew, and defend yourself against the occasional space scum. More will come.\n\nIf you're looking for a faster paced space game, this won't be for you.

UPDATE: After reading Flaagg's review, I'm going to\n//  try this again.\n\n\nEven in its current pre-alpha state, gameplay is really very engaging.  It just kept me up until 4am!\n\nI would call this a 2D KSP.  But it's also artful, as you can see from some of the screenshots.  Reminds me of Factorio that way.\n\nI only recommend this game if you are already familiar with controlling orbits, (maybe if you've landed on the moon with KSP).  It also doesn't hurt if you've watched some of the youtube videos showing people who are hopelessly lost trying to figure out how the game works.  I know that helped me at least.\n\nThe main gameplay (within 1 hour of picking up the game) is to keep the crew fed.  So landing on space stations is a big priority.  Along the way if you can mine an asteroid and sell some of the ore and use the money to pay for the food, then that's not half bad.  It also doesn't hurt to try to figure out how to optimize the ship to make it more maneuverable and hold more cargo, along with solar panels to recharge the batteries.\n\nAnd landing on the space station -- yeah whoever made those space stations was a complete dufus!  They put the landing ports in between the ship and the solar panels so there's all this maneuvering to try to connect without breaking things in the process!  :)  It's pretty fun and there's NO PAUSE, so it can feel a bit extreme getting the hang of the controls, which I tend to get mixed up (rotate left, rotate right, forward, backward, strafe left, strafe right).  Maybe reassigning the keys would make that more intuitive.\n\nYou can make a ship very similar to Reassembly, something that handles very much the same way.  This means when the ship is upside-down on the screen, somehow the brain figures out how to reverse steering just like controlling a remote-controlled car.  Except in Reassembly fuel was infinite, and here fuel is finite, and so it requires great attention and planning.\n\nIn the current state, beware that it's pre-alpha.  But also the flip side is don't miss out.  The experience is worth your time.","November 18, 2015","true","14.4"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

As a fan of KSP, the attraction of combining orbital mechanics along with a shipbuilding system similar to starmade or Space engineers made this game look like a good choice. It's not.\n\nProblems with the game:Lack of Navigation aids: As a note to the devs: it's a good job this game takes place in a 2D plane as otherwise it would be absolutely impossible. As it stands, if you want your player base to be able to use the game (I've reach Jool in KSP, without using Mechjeb) their going to need (a lot) more than a rudimentary autopilot, a piece of software that stops your rotation but not where you want it rather 90 degrees perpendicular to the direction you want.\n\nCounter intuitive routing system: I have output node and input nodes? Right. So I connect output nodes from soar panels onto the battery's input node but are limited to one panel per battery. Right.\n\nNow I connect a modules input node to the input node on the battery. Surely each battery should have a in and out node? And surely I should be able to connect my solar panels and batteries to ensure equal charge distribution.\n\nLack of build information: KSP has a brilliant method of informing you the posistion of the COM of a vessel and all it's other attributes, meanwhile in CC you are left wondering if your ship is balanced, and left to figure out if the resources you carry are balanced. If not you spin around in circles, wasting the fuel you have to mine, and to mine it, that involves being able to rendezvous with an asteroid. Read above for issues with this.\n\nLack of a clear goal: most other sandboxes your given an idea of what to do. Minecraft: build something and explore. KSP: go further from kerbin and (try to) come back alive. Fortresscraft Evolved: survive and charge the OET. This, I had no idea, due to a lack of storage to carry resources to upgrade the vessel you started with.\nWhile the game is in early access, these are not issues that should be in a game. A counter-intuitive system for routing things around, a lack of something to really do, minimal build help and minimal flight help (good luck rendevouing).\n\nNot to mention the devs wasted time adding 3D models to a game that works on a 2D plane. Oh good! I can rotate the camera to view my ship from multiple angles, even though it can't do anything due to all the fuel being burnt trying to rendezvous with an asteroid!\n\nWish I had realised how bad it was before 2 weeks has passed. My recommendation? Go play Starmade or Space Engineers, you'll enjoy them more.\n\nOr Istrolid. It's free to play and has devs that don't want to steal your wallet.","February 8","false","1.6"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

As a Kerbal Space Program addict I must say this is one that you should pickup if you are too and would like to support its development (it is EARLY ACCESS after all).\n\nIt is in essence a 2D space sim where you build a ship part-by-part in space and go about mining (so far) and surviving. Your crew will need food and your ship will need power and fuel. Build a bigger ship with more storage and more power, lasers and crew, and you will find yourself having a blast.\n\nIt's space physics/orbital mechanics is quite well simulated but do note, this is an early access so expect there to be lots of work to be done until release. You will find there is little content but the devs are working hard at it. For now your challenge will be trying to get more and more food and fuel to survive without flinging yourself into an asteriod.\n\nIt has a fairly steep learning curve for new-comers and even more so new-comers to the space sim genre but I'd highly suggest to take a peak at the guides and experiment how modules connect and transfer resources.\n\nMore parts will be coming as well as AI ships filling the universe with life and dangers throughout its systems.\n\nA work in progress but looks very promising thus far.

I dont know if these guys really have a solid longterm-roadmap on what this game will really be when its done but does that bother me? Not at all.\n\nRight now what 'CC' is is fun to toy around with. Obviously there are still some elemental things missing und weird stuff can happen like you would expect from Early Access, but steady progress and the friendly & responsive Devs make it fun to watch this game take shape. Whether this will turn out to be an arcadey deathmatch in orbits or an everlasting exploration game with proper mining and manufacturing of parts - ill take it all.\n\nIn a way this game is like KSP in 2D - so expect meneuvering being tricky at times. Use proper orbital-mechanics like you would in KSP to get around and conserve fuel.

Over-taxing your thrusters can leave you adrift far too fast at the moment.\n\nThe orbiting mechanic and gravity effects are neat, but to me its just out of reach of the perception to make it really sink in well to shift your flight easy. Hard to tell which direction your path is going, ending up with a bit of a problem if you pass the mark too far the wrong way.\n\nSandboxing is fun and interesting, but its a bit more of a conceptual phase at the moment I would argue than anywhere near a working platform.\n\nGreat promise, plenty of heart and attention to detial - just needs that gaming tweak to let the fun aspect sink in.","March 26, 2015","true","4.2"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

The obvious comparison is with EVE Online, but there is a lot this game wants to be that Eve is not; mainly, a physics-realistic, 2D, space sandbox that isn't MMO and riddled with microtransactions.  On the downside (IMO), this is much, *much* smaller scale than EVE is.  On the upside, it's far more intimate than EVE - I could easily gather one or two friends and start playing around with no issue,  I could see some people having fun with this in single player, but it's multiplayer where this game really stands out, which is good since it's multiplayer that seems to have the most potential.\n\nThe game itself looks good, albeit simple.  This isn't a limitaion of the game, it's a design choice made by the devs, leading this to be a game that's easily accessible to all, and even opening the possibility of a mobile port waaaaay down the line.  I really appreciate this choice, if only because I've lived the majority of my life gaming on low end machines.\n\nThe sandbox aspect of the game is embraced whole-heartedly, giving absolutely no tutorial or instruction aside from a popup windows in the beginning that's shorter than this review.   The game does help with the more difficult stuff, like rendezvous with meteors and other ships by showing relative velocity vectors, but it took me a while to find them.  It definitely reminds me of Minecraft, but Minecraft could get away with it on account of it's relative simplicity.   Learning orbital mechanics without any help isn't my personal idea of fun.\n\nAll-in-all, I like the direction the game is going, and I can't wait until there is more of it to play!","January 3","true","1.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

That is however because I enjoy semi-realistic simulations, love orbital mechanics, have a taste for cience fiction, and am generally going through an indecisive phase in terms of entertainment.\n\nThis game is far from finished but I am cautiously optimistic. I've been burned by titles like Starbound and Towns (early access before steam greenlight) in the past. Naturally I didn't expect much. This game however, is seeing regular updates. It's also changed a lot. Most of the guides are outdated and there seems to be quite a shift in how manufacturing mechanics work.\n\nLets start with what you should expect from this game at the time of writing. There are lovely orbital physics, even thought they feel a bit clunky compared to KSP (which is this game's nearest comparison). The idea of having to collect lots of resources (12 at this time) is actually kind of cool, but again clunky.\n\nBy clunky I mean the following. So orbital physics works, but as a vetran of KSP I know how imporant it is to know your prograde/retrograde vector (i.e the line that runs at a tangent to your orbit). This isn't difficult to code but is not in the game at all, all intercepts have to be done manually (you get no intercept vector) with lots of tedious course correction which would be fine if fuel wasn't such a massive concern. This leads to resources, to get fuel you need to mine ice, which can then be broken into oxygen and hydrogen by using a fuel maker. This gives you your propulsion, and you will need to carry huge quantities of this fuel to get anywhere significant. On top of these 3 resources you will need at least 1 cargo container for each of the 8 other elements which are commonly used to manufacture components. You'll find yourself frantically managing these containers because once a resource output has filled up the container it dumps it dumps it in another empty  one. This wouldn't be so bad if the same output wasn't also the input for when you want to use that resource to build things. What this leads to is a module being half built and you having to figure out what resource isn't properly connected to allow the build. This can legitimately take 2 to 5 minutes as it's like trying to untangle a pair of earphones. Resource connections being represented as lines that you have to trace to a point.\n\nSo why do I like this game and why at 3 or so hours will I play it again? Simply, it's a great idea. A bit more casual that KSP in terms of gameplay and realism. It's also fun in different ways. The nearest comparison I can make is that if Celestial Command is to KSP what Terraria is to Minecraft. They're similar but enjoyably different. If you liked KSP but had a hankering to blow a few things up or just chill out and do some silly things like destroy a station with a mining laser, then give Celestial Command a go at some point in the future. If however you're bored of KSP and want a variation on the theme, you'll get about 3-5 hours out of this game.\n\nA final note is the game's language. I know the devs aren't native English speakers but it's just lazy. Get someone in to write tooltips for all the modules so they explain themselves properly. Otherwise it's really difficult to get into the game. Hell I'd write the tooltips for a copywriters fee. I want to see this game become a fully fledged product. I want to play it again after the major updates. So devs, if someone you know who speaks English is reading, make a few core tweaks to your resource management, orbital mechanics and your tooltips. It will make the game much more playable and much easier to recommend in it's current state. Also ditch the whole one element for each cargo container, it's just boring.","August 29, 2015","true","5.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You will not get a container for ice so build a large ore container for it.\n\nTo mine - install a beam structer infront with a mining laser right beside for precision mining and install a grabber on the beam structure to grab astroids.\n\nFIND THE ICE FIRST - start mining ice which will go into the large container and install a fuel generator. Install 2 huge fuel tanks for the hydrogen. Transfer the hydrogen to the huge fuel container and connect the oxygen node with the fuel container that once contained hydrogen. this should take care of the fuel as long as you have enough ice.\nthen get solar panels, use them to charge the power storage to be used by the fuel generator and the mining laser.\n\nInstall 2 - 4 booster rockets (first rocket in the build menu for propulsion) for evasive manuver to either quickly get out another astroid or station's way and to break the gravitational pull caused by planets or just for a speed boost. You can also add more RCS rockets for a increase in speed without spending oxygen for the bigger rockets.\n\nThats pretty much what you need to start with.. weapons and other stuff comes later. Also you need lots of aluminum since that is a very commonly used material to build with.","September 28, 2015","true","15.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I still to this day dont know how to generate electricity, nor use Rockets/put them to a key\n\nI began building random crap such as stuff with alot of Fuel tanks, i figured how to load fuel n, but not generate it.As i began building i realised alot of stuf in-game is hard to understand.After i began understanding, i ried out some stuff.

I believe that they fixed something but this suggest they are struggling with code-quality which does not bode well for the long-term playability of the game.","January 3","false","2.4"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

We know it's early access alright? But when your basic tutorial is a mess a whole year after you release in EA, it probably tells us something about your planning.\n\nFirst of all, this is another one of those "gather resources and survive" type of games, as if we don't have enoug of those already.\n\nSecond of all, this is has a HUGE learning cliff, and I'm not talking about the orbital mechanics, which alone would drive off most casual player. I'm talking about the most basic things, like how to even build your ship. To even start building, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1) "right click the eingeering bay" as the "tutorial" tells you\n1.1) click on every modue because you don't know which is the engineering bay, it's not like the game tells you, maybe when you hove over the part? nope, it doesn't. You just have to click every single module.\n1.2) find out that none of the modules brings out the engineering bay and start feeling frustrated.\n1.3) figure out that you need to put crew into your engineering bay, like yea why would I not do that? like isn't it basic game design that anything a player would do anyway, should be automatic?\n2) press c to bring up the crew panels\n3) drag a crew into the engineering bay\n4) now right click the engineering bay\n5) now you can build things\n6) find out that the things you build don't do anything because they need to be connected\n6.1) read that the "tutorial" says you need to connect the engines to whatever module\n6.2) find out that you don't know which part is the engine, because again, it doesn't stell you which part is what, at all.\n6.3) I see where they're going with this, realistic space ships would have engines like that, but do you really expect normal people to look for engines on the SIDE of a space ship? Wouldn't they loot at the back end? and fall on their face attempting that?\n6.4) even though you had to drag the crews for the crew panel, you can't drag the connection nodes, yea it sounds minor but subconsciously you expect consistency from a single game so you try to drag the connection nodes and get frustrated because it doesn't do anything.\n6.5) and it's not a simple left click either, nope that would be too straight forward. You see this time it's right click the nodes you want to connect.\n7) find out that the mining laser and the power generators they tell you build have no connectors, even though in the tutorial it tells you to connect them to whatever they have to be connected to.\n7.1) find out that in the "guide" section of this game's community page they just tell you to build the mining laser but don't tell you how to use it.\n7.2) find out that no matter what you do you can't make the modules do anything what so ever.\n8) refund this game and write a negative review.","July 23, 2015","false","0.3"," 8 of 21 people (38%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","38","8","21","2","7"
