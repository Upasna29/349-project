"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tearatherflesh/recommended/204760/","tearatherflesh","Heath","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tearatherflesh/","192 products in account","Imagine playing a terribly generic game like this for 20+ hours, then getting to a final boss that completely and utterly destroys you, with no possible way to defeat it. That's what this game is on the hardest difficulty...a horrible, broken waste of time. I don't normally hate games...in fact, I have tons of bad games and love a good portion of them...but this one is a very clear exception.\n\nEDIT: FYI, the reason I have 20+ hours into this game is because, on the hardest difficulty, it can take over an hour killing some bosses, since you will completely run out of ammo within a few minutes (even if you started with max ammo) and have to spend a short eterninty shooting the bosses with your weak, inaccurate, infinite-ammo sidearm until they die (and if you break cover for more than a second during this time, you die and have to start over). The endboss is the same thing, except with a 5 minute time limit (and the boss isn't even on screen for most of that time...and you have no cover...and you are surrounded by regenerating flying turrets. Literally impossible to beat).","November 28, 2013","false","22.3"," 178 of 201 people (89%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","89","178","201","7","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IidoTheFox/recommended/204760/","IidoTheFox","Light","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IidoTheFox/","232 products in account","This is probably one of the worst third-person shooters I have ever played. I believe it's best described as a cross between Mind Jack and Gears of War. Take Mind Jack's laughable story and repetitive level design, take away it's mindhacking. Take Gears of War and remove its memorable characters and epic set pieces, and make it's cover system dysfunctional. Add in some underwater sections, and you pretty much have Deep Black: Reloaded. Of course, that's not enough for a review, now is it? It's time to elaborate on exactly why this game blows.\n\nI went through a lot of annoyance just trying to get the game to run. For those who don't know, the Steam purchase of this game is, in fact, BROKEN. It does not work properly, unless you either block the game with your firewall or disconnect your internet briefly. Was it worth it? Read on...\n\nThis game is the definition of repetition. There is very little variety to the levels. Just about every single level follows the same basic forumla: Go through room, kill enemies, go through more rooms, kill more enemies, go into brief underwater section, open underwater door, MAYBE shoot a couple baddies underwater, get to surface, rinse & repeat. Level design is bland, generally consisting of a number of tight corridors and larger rooms that all look the same. The enemy variety is very limited, as well. As the game progresses, you'll encounter a couple new types of baddies, but for the most part you're killing the same ol' enemies throughout the whole game. And while the same could be said for many GOOD games, too, how would you react if I told you that they literally couldnt think of more than one kind of boss? I'm not kidding. While there are a number of boss fights throughout the game, almost EVERY SINGLE ONE is against a giant robotic crab. The conditions under which they are fought are somewhat different each time, but the fact remains that they re-use this same boss throughout the entire game.\n\nNow to tackle what the developers were basically trying to sell the game on:  The underwater sections. As another reviewer put it, they are basically just to get from land point A to land point B, and sadly, they try to make this one of the strongest selling points. It really adds nothing to the game whatsoever. There are a couple of unique things you can do while underwater, such as hacking specific robots so that they will aid you, but good luck doing this while being shot at left and right.\n\nThe controls are frustrating, and the game's cover system only seems to work about 70% of the time. Most of the deaths you incur will be from the controls or cover system goofing up, and not player error.\n\nThe story is nothing memorable, either. Most of the game's story is told through short cutscenes that occur before or after certain missions. The problem is that the storytelling just feels forced. Very forced. To the point that it feels like they were just making it up as they went along, for the sake of keeping the game moving. Couple that with forgettable characters, and you've got yourself a plot that you'll forget sooner than a goldfish forgets it's lunch.\n\nAs for sound, there's not much positive to say there either. The voice acting is some of the laziest I've heard in a long while, and the soundtrack is subpar at best.\n\nAll of this may have been more bearable if the game was of a shorter length, but it drags on for far, far too long, which just magnifies the already glaring flaws.\n\nPoor controls, a broken cover system, boring, bland level designs, very limited enemy variety, ONE TYPE OF BOSS (save for the final, which I actually could not bring myself to defeat), a forgettable story, and completely unmemorable characters make this one of the worst third person shooters I have ever played, if not the worst. There is literally nothing to inspire you to keep playing or attach the player to the game.\n\nI would never recommend this game unless you just want to see for yourself how bad it is. It's one of those games that doesn't look terrible from videos or screenshots, and that you have to play yourself to see how truly bad it is. And this is coming from someone who's usually very open minded about games, and actually enjoys a lot of games that many others think suck!","January 7, 2014","false","26.7"," 115 of 124 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","115","124","0","1"

Gameplay's your standard third person cover shooter type deal minus a sprint ability that would make crossing the game's dull gray facility environments even more of a bore. Guns sound decent, nothing special but certainly not terrible, voice acting's pretty awful, you hear the same things from the enemies over and over again, with drawn out and rather hilarious death screams, and the script in general is up there with the likes of Global Ops: Commando Libya and Rogue Warrior, only with less profanity. The underwater sections are alright, giving you a third dimension to worry about, but the enemy AI is so simplistic and these areas are so few and far between that they don't change much.\nSpeaking of enemies, you've got your standard assault rilfe guy, shotgun guy, rocket guy, the commando that carries the gun of the same name, snipers, and all sorts of robots and turrets that are tedious as hell to kill. Tedious is pretty much the defining word of this game. When you die during one of the too-lengthy boss fights, you redo the section right before which often has you walking down a corridor or pressing a couple buttons and getting to hear the terrible dialogue again and again.\nAnd the icing on the cake is that it crashed and deleted all my save data in the final act of the game.

Hell ♥♥♥♥ing no.\n\nThis game is the ONLY game (so far) that I ACTUALLY wish I could remove from my steam account. I don't even want a refund, I just want this filth removed from my account forever.\n\nWhere to start... The game is just for lack of a better word... boring. The environments you fight in very quickly become "exhausting" to be in, and you just end up wanting to get to the next area as fast as possible in hopes of something different. The enemy is a complete joke. They pretty much stand there waiting to be slaughtered like mindless zombies. It takes zero ♥♥♥♥ing strategy to fight the enemy in this game. I'm not asking for f.e.a.r. level Ai, but holy ♥♥♥♥ing Christ all mighty don't give me target dummies either. The first boss I fought (I use the term boss very loosely) was absolutely pathetic. Combat literally consisted of "strafe between the pillars, shoot, strafe, shoot, strafe, shoot, dead." It was like fighting ♥♥♥♥ing Atlas at the end of Bioshock. The only thing this boss had going for it though was that it took forever to freaking kill, and even that is hardly a good thing when the combat is mind numbing.\n\nThe story is just sad, I mean they didn't even try. You know what though I'll be honest, I can't critque too hard in this area considering I didn't even finish the game, but the basis of it did not impress. Let me sum it up for you. Mysterious unknown private military organization has some sort of weapon (if I recall correctly, it's been a bit since I've played the "game"), it's up to you to find them and stop them. That's it. That's the story. The voice acting makes me want to puke, really. Not so much the voice acting, but the script really. I mean... oh god. It really sounds like I'm just focusing on the negatives of the game, and trying to make every potential annoyance a big issue, but sadly all there is to this game IS annoying ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.\n\nI don't know, perhaps it's not my kind of game. This doesn't change the fact however, that I would probably be more entertained sticking my hand into a jar of acid than playing this game.","June 9, 2014","false","2.9"," 38 of 47 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","38","47","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HYRULESKNIGHT/recommended/204760/","HYRULESKNIGHT","Hyrulesknight","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HYRULESKNIGHT/","754 products in account","This game is absolute trash. If you were to look in the forums the only thing you will see are posts on how this game it will not even load, and to fix it you must block the game in your firewall or unplug your computer from the internet. This game has been out for 2 years and that issue has yet to be fixed.\n\nOnce you are in the game you will be presented with a laughable 3rd person cover shooter. I say it is laughable because the enemy AI is dumber than a toddler. The enemies will sometimes "take cover" outside of actual cover. They will run straight at you one-by-one until you melee them all to death in a pile. While they aren't smart they are perfect shots and will hit you 95% of the time.\n\nThe next terrible thing is the voice acting. Every death presents you with a death cry 1000 times more cheesy than the Wilhelm scream. Every enemy will have this terrible selection of death cries, and you will hear them even if they get shot in the head.\n\nThe main characters are straight out of the generic action handbook with your grizzly sounding general and your Michele Rodriguez tough chick commander. I can't tell if the written dialouge is supposed to be bad on purpose, but every sentence is cringe worthy.\n\nThe story is non-existant and it is your typical solider gets betrayed by his commanding officers, but manages to save the day trope. Chatacters will often forget and act surpised about something that they just said last cutscene.\n\nThe only positive thing I can say about this game is that it has some decent visuals, but unfortunately not a great art direction. You will make your way through some generic factories/plants and although each act is distinct it is all just lackluster.\n\nI have expereinced a couple of annoying bugs in the game. The first is when an enmy tried to melee me underwater and since they got the jump on me they win the attack, but I am able to get free. As soon as I am free though I am immdiately put back into the melee cutscene, and this happens until I end up dying, with no way for me to win that fight. The second is that you will constantly be randomly kicked out of cover, which will result in your death.\n\nCurrently I am on a part of the game that is very difficult, even on the easiest difficulty. You can watch the walkthoughs on youtube to verify that other people have a problem in this same part. I am not sure I even want to continue trying to beat the game.\n\nI have no idea why anyone would pay 30 dollars for this game. I regret paying the 5 dollars I did.\n\nTL;DR DO NOT BUY THIS GAME\n\n","July 5, 2014","false","7.2"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/black_pawn/recommended/204760/","black_pawn","BlackPawn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/black_pawn/","195 products in account","It's not very good.\n\nPros:\nThe underwater sections are quite pretty.\nSometimes there is innovation in the underwater maps.\nThe maps are generally fairly big and are mostly single maps that sometimes wrap around themselves nicely.\nThere is some variety in the enemies but they're mostly reserved for special encounters, which is maybe good because many of them are irritating.\nHeadshots do high damage.\n\nCons: (many)\nHeadshots do high damage.  Stepping out from cover to go down to one lucky shot, really gets old.\nIt's a generic over-the-shoulder shooter.\nSupposedly it's a PC native but it sure feels like a half-hearted console port.\nControls are poorly chosen and can't be remapped, examples: mellee and grenade are next to each other, alt-fire and change weapon are on the same button (mouse scroll button).  These lead to all sorts of accidents under pressure where you change to your pistol instead of using a powerful attack, or drop grenades at point blank when melleeing enemies.\nMany enemies have stun-lock and you just get to watch for a few seconds before you die.\nSome of the battles are very. very hard.  I repeated one fight for about ten hours in total.  I think most people would have given up.  It's usually worth using glitches.\nHacking enemy drones is a thing but it can be very hard to pull off sometimes as it randomly fails without reason.  Sometimes this happens many times in a row and you die.\nThe surface maps are things you've seen before many times.\nThe armour's glowing health meter is a fairly direct rip of Dead Space, maybe that doesn't matter though.\nYou move very slowly when leaving cover or changing direction, there is no run button and the 'roll' mechanic is pretty useless.  This leads to you slowly taking small steps in combat when you try to retreat.  Retreating is generally suicidal.\nMellee is a one-button kill, assuming you didn't fumble and hit grenade.  This makes the mellee enemies (one human, one drone) more or less harmless.  Enemy mellee attacks do light damage and you have maybe ten seconds to hit 'f' when they attack you before they might succeed in killing you.\nThe various unlocks that you get in the game (infinte ammo, golden gun) can't be used.  They literally do not do anything when activated.\n\nSummary:\nThe game isn't exciting and doesn't really have anything new.  Hydrophobia did water better, there are dozens of shooters that do combat better.  Being second-best to Hydrophobia isn't harsh criticism though the surface game isn't exciting so really, I should have just played Hydrophobia again.\n\nThe biggest con of all is that getting the game working in the first place requires some non-trivial research.  I'll save you the time, this game will not run unless you implement a firewall rule in Windows to prevent it dialing home to the original developer's website.  They do not support the game anymore (sold it to some third party that put it on steam) so the steam version will not run in its released form.  You must make a firewall rule to block the game's .exe from internet.  This also cancels multiplayer but since no one is playing it in MP anwyay, that's no big deal.\n","September 5, 2014","false","17.4"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

If the difficulty wouldn't be too hard, maybe I would've the patience to finish it but now, nope!

And had told them I had already done it. DO NOT BUY. SUPPORT IS NON-EXISTANT. Download the demo to see if the game will play before spending any money on this product.\n\nUPDATE: It's been 36 days since the last time they sent me any troubleshooting, which consisted of them telling me to run Steam in Administrator. Even though I told them everything I had already done, they didn't bother reading my email, they just started going down the list. I've tried getting Steam involved, this is some shady ♥♥♥♥. We'll see if Steam steps up for Strategy First.\n\nFINAL UPDATE: Steam went ahead and removed the game from my list and provided me a full refund for the purchase of the game.

It only cost me $7.50, which was too much for what I ended up with. I wasn't expecting GTA 5 quality but was hoping for what was described on Steam store page. I had to open Norton and disable internet access for this game, just so it would run. Which also means, No Multiplayer! (not the reason I got it but again, its what was described). There is no way to change keyboard control layout, which for me is a big deal. It look good, gameplay is about 5 out of 10, has some good humor in it. But thats all. I played a couple hours and decided that, if the price drops to less than $2 -$3, then I recomend this game.
