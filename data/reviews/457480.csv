Good for those wanting to get all the achievements in a game, or those who just want to play with virtual dominoes! Free play mode is open from the start so you can go crazy with your own creations.\n\nI wish you could edit the levels themselves in free-play, but for the price I think the game is worth it!","April 10","true","2.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/457480/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Russpuppy, it’s good to have you back on Steamified. This is the second of the developer-publisher’s games that we’ve been fortunate enough to spotlight so far this year. The first was The Deletion which we featured very early on (January 7th). Where The Deletion was a fast paced minimalist puzzle-platformer Domino Sky is a much slower paced strategic game where the objective is to drop dominos into a lovely cascade in order to complete puzzles.\n\nI love the game. I was one of those kids who used to pull out my dominos to put them on the kitchen table, the living room carpet or any surface that I could possibly find to see how many dominos I could get to cascade down. Some of my most cherished childhood memories were doing spending hours doing this with friends. It was one game that I was pretty darn good at. Winning came relatively easy but I truly did love seeing how artistic friends could be with their dominos. Therefore you could say that I’ve been waiting for such a game to come out for a long, long time. And with Russpuppy’s excellence of execution they didn’t disappoint me. Sure, it could be a little more polished but the game does what it sets out to do. I love the different challenges and that the achievements tied to them are spaced out that you have to work for the next one and the next one until you’ve completed the game which I am dead set going to do at some point. The physics are also pretty much close to perfection which is absolutely an important facet of the game.\n\nIf I had to nitpick on the game a little it would be that the camera is a little frustrating. I would have liked it to have been a little more mobile and easy to move than what it is. But it does move it’s just a little bit of a struggle at times to get it where you want it to be. Other than that I have no complaints at all with the game. There’s more than a sufficient amount of levels for a sub-$5 game and you also have free build mode for those who want to be artistic and build something spectacular.\n\nIf I could offer something a little unnecessary but a wishlist item for the title it would have been nice to see a little game of dominos implemented into the game. Perhaps unnecessary but it would have been a really sweet touch.\n\nThe game has been Steamified with trading cards and achievements.\n\nA hearty and childlike recommendation. Thanks Russpuppy.\n\nFor more reviews and our popular giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com.\n","May 2","true","12.8"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ItsGaVs/recommended/457480/","ItsGaVs","GaVs ♥","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ItsGaVs/","59 products in account","Wow. The only reason I found this game was through crafting a few Steam Badges and getting a Coupon for this game. Now, to be honest, the games they give coupons for are not so great. But, I do always look at the games I get coupons for. This game, casually look at the trailer, looks like a fun little indie game, decide to get it for $1.99. I download it, takes around 2 minutes, and launch it.In the launch, it asks me what graphics and resolution I want. That's a plus. I choose my settings, BOOM! Play the first few level, very simple, a good game to chill out to with some great music choices. Btw, I know I'm a terrible reviewer :P\n\nPROS:\n~Simple Concept\n~Steam Achievments\n~Steam Badges\n~Very Nice Music\n~Has Different Skins for your personal enjoyment\n~Great Price\n~For the price, a very good amount of levels\n~Steam Achievment pictures are nice for showcases\n~PHYSICS BRO!?\n~Just Quality in all aspects\n\nCONS:\n~So far (a few hours into the game) I have not found any problems in the game.\n\nThanks for reading my review! Have a good day :)","April 28","true","2.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

For proceeding next level lastly you have to make your domino way to biggest ball!\n\nThis game have 40 levels and free play mode where you can make what ever domino path you want!\n\nAlso you can get different domino styles when you finish some levels. You can change those domino styles when accessing pause menu in game\n\nPros\n- Great gameplay that just works!\n- Relaxing music\n- Smooth camera controls\n- Plays on older computers too!\n- Awesome visuals\n- Level design is interesting\n\nCons\n- Dominoes style can suddenly change to default\n- It would be great if I can make own levels and submit them to other players!\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThis is great and unique puzzler that will keep you busy for long times. You will definitely  come back to play this","April 10","true","2.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Also ran well on my less than stellar machine.  As a kid who owned Domino Rally though, I expected more.  I was hoping for some really crazy stuff that took advantage of the things you can do on a computer that you can't do in reality.  Maybe I was expecting too much, but at the moment I really can't recommend this for more than $1","April 10","false","1.4"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"
