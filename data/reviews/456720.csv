Very fun side scroller that combines strategy, humor and action.  Hilarious main character and plot make this game a new retro addition to your library you won\'t regret.\n\nPros\nGreat story\nplenty of environments and enemies\nWorks well on a game pad\nStrategy filled traps instead of repetitive walk forward and kill\nPlenty of weapons\n\nCons\nThe some aoe has odd hit detection\nYou can get stuck in harder puzzles without the needed ammo","June 1","true","2.0"," 2 of 20 people (10%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","10","2","20","2","0"
