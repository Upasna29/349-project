Once you pick up your first red note, a counter appears in the bottom right.\n1 / 6 for instance. Seems a bit familiar.\n\nThere are two types of items you get walking around the halls: Glowsticks and Flares.\n\nGlowsticks give a little bit more light and hint you at things you can actually interact with. Also they show your footsteps, helping you with orientation. This is quite important as the map on your smartphone is so tiny that you can hardly see stuff, even when zooming in (putting it closer to your face).\n\nFlares have a defensive purpose. I'll explain later what that means.\n\nSo basically there is one simple and quite obvious pattern:\n1. Get red notes\n2. Find key to exit\n3. Enter next area.\n\nNow where is the scary part?\nBesides some objects randomly moving when you pass them (of course only the first time to come along) and the actually quite good ambience, there is one threat so far: A ghost girl.\n\nIs she scary? no... during the first chapter you see her already when she is like 100 meters away from you and you can casually walk away. When you look at her she attacks by standing still and screaming at you, which doesn't even have an effect, if you are far away. If this actually hits you, the screen starts turning black from outside to inside, making it extremely hard to see. Your visions gets better over time though. To avoid this, hold a flare in the ghost's face.\n\nOnce you reach the next chapter and it all starts again the ghost will actually appear directly behind you and there you have your slenderman clone.\n\nHonestly, for anyone who has experience with horror, this game has nothing to offer except for startling you every now and then.\nIf you never touched a horror game before and want to start with something that isn't too horrible or if you plain and simple love to do the same thing over and over again, feel free to take a look at this.\n\nAnybody who wants horror beyond cheap jumpscares and some actual gameplay should ignore this game.","November 2, 2014","false","1.3"," 193 of 222 people (87%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","87","193","222","4","0"

This resurgence is, oddly enough, not due to people's desires to play these games themselves, but rather to watch others play them on the internet. I digress, whatever the reason, developers are back to delivering scars and suspense to those who have the steely nerves required to complete these games. Daylight attempts to elbow it's way to the front of the crowd, nudging past fan favorites like Slender: The Eight Pages, Outlast and Amnesia: The Dark Decent. With it's procedurally generated mazes and visuals bolstered by Epic's Unreal 4 engine, Daylight has the goods to garner the interest of fans but does it deliver the tension and scares of it's contemporaries?\n\nDaylight wastes no time with any kind of lead-in or build up. Immediately, you take control of Sarah, a girl stranded in a dilapidated hospital who... Well, you aren't really told anything about Sarah...You don't see her face, aren't clued into her age or her background and why she's in the middle of this hospital is a mystery. The most intriguing aspect of Sarah is the bizzare maze-like network of lines that appear on her arm. With only her cell phone and a mysterious male voice to guide her, Sarah must wander around in search of documents called remnants and collecting all of the documents in an area allows her to obtain a sigil which unlocks a magically sealed door to the next area. If this sounds vaguely familiar, that's because it's pretty much the same set up as the Slender games. Along the way, pictures will fall off of walls unexpectedly, drawers from filing cabinets with shoot across the room and wheelchairs and IV drip racks will squeak across the floor in this veritable digital funhouse.\n\nNestled between each area that hosts a remnant hunt are areas that require some light puzzle solving and collecting more documents that attempt to build a narrative. The puzzles are inconsequential, requiring some switch flipping and crate pushing. Sarah can also use glowsticks to illuminate objects of interest since apparently the magical elements she encounters respond to chemiluminescence... Lockers, supply boxes and crates can all be opened for flares, glowsticks and documents. The problem is that all of this can be made frustrating as a result of clunky controls. Opening a locker can involve and awkward tango while trying to prompt the contextual command to pop up and grant Sarah access to it's contents. Pushable crates can only be moved from one side so players must circle them like a shark in order to find the side they can interact with. Sarah also moves at a ponderous pace by default meaning the patience of a zen master is required to navigate the environment. While she can sprint, the exaggerated head bob can make some players sick and is at the very least disorienting, making exploration difficult. The witches that want to tear Sarah limb from limb appear at random, often behind players and can be warded off with flares. Flares and glowsticks are not exactly in short supply but the real challenge is making it to the magically sealed doors with the sigil in hand since your trusty flares cannot be used. It can get frustrating when you find yourself cornered by a spawning witch with no recourse.\n\nWhile players can get the same type of gameplay from several other games on the market, one would at least expect the narrative to differentiate Daylight from other titles. This would be a mistake however, since Daylight is on a strict diet of cliches and hackery. By dropping it's protagonist into a scenario without any introduction it drives a large wedge between players and the characters involved. Where the protagonists of other horror games reflect on their growing unease or decaying sanity, Sarah does nothing to reflect on her predicament aside from calling out into the dark, announcing that she is aware of some unseen presence. All of this culminates in an inane plot twist that has little consequence given the abysmal character development. There is nothing for players to be invested in and the mysteries surrounding the hospital, it's patients and Sarah merely come off as set dressing.\n\nGiven that Daylight is running on the shiny new Unreal 4 engine, one would at least expect it to look great but the procedural level generation betrays this expectation by requiring environments to be modular making it reminiscent of being trapped in one of Skyrim's dungeons. One room offers few details to distinguish itself from another and, were it not for the fact that there is an ever present map on Sarah's phone, getting lost would be a frequent occurrence. Props are generic and as a result many areas don't feel like they have a purpose and the decaying buildings that players have to navigate look sparse, with even simple details like windows being few and far between. Lighting is also rather generic as a result of this design so don't expect to see any of the extraordinary expressionist surroundings offered by a game like Outlast. Continuing the trend of treading well worn ground, Daylight also suffers from it's choice of environments by featuring horror game staples like a hospital, prison, sewers and a forest. Ultimately, Daylight lacks the all important atmosphere that allows a horror game to truly get under your skin in a way that jump scares cannot. Despite looking like a student project, the frame rate has a tendency to chug in some areas and I did experience a crash during my two hour playthrough. Sound design keeps the tension up but does little to stand out from similar games.\n\nDaylight is truly embarrassing as it gormandizes on cliches and tropes, digests and squeezes them out of it's sphincter for Twitch streamers and let's play hosts to gobble up. There is absolutely no reason to endure Daylight, even with it's short play time. The decision to make Daylight a procedurally generated experience cuts it's nose off to spite it's face. Randomizing the design of levels does so much to negatively impact an already lackluster experience by stripping the atmosphere from the experience. The hubris required to commit such an atrocious design blunder in order to add replayability to a title that isn't even worth seeing through once is staggering. Everything you can find in Daylight is available in other, more enjoyable games. The uninspired gameplay and fan fiction grade narrative have no place in a world where titles like Amnesia and Outlast exist. If only this game never saw the light of day...","April 30, 2014","false","2.7"," 156 of 195 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","156","195","2","12"

Neither.\n\nRemember Slenderman? The one that was in early beta but still got popular due to its basic yet effective gameplay formula? Since it became so popular, we had a huge number of clones, remakes and spiritual successors with different interpretations of the story and the monster himself. I don't know about you, but none of them were truly my cup of tea - not even the full Slender: The Arrival game itself.\n\nDaylight is, though. It follows Slenderman's legacy every step of the way, while trading the open forest for procedurally generated corridors, which works for this type of gameplay. If you don't know what Slenderman is, here's a simple explanation of its mechanics: collect documents, avoid the enemy and never look at him. Looking at him triggers his aggro and scariness ensues. Very simple yet very effective.\nDaylight uses the same mechanics with a few extra touches here and there which is enough to make the game stand out without overcomplicating it.\n\nIts main issue is relying almost purely on cheap jumpscares, although even without them the atmosphere is quite unnerving. And as far as jumpscares go, Daylight can at the very least show some good ones. The ghost is well detailed, and the sound design is genuinely creepy. Bricks are expected to be ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•.\n\nI understand why people dislike it. It's not as story-heavy as one would want, although IMO the ending was worth reading through the notes you find. Its scares are cheap and don't change throughout the game, the ghosts can be outsmarted and the overall experience leaves you wanting just a tad bit more... but if it's scares you want, then scares you shall get.\n\nIt's one of those games that you should force your friends to play and just enjoy them jumping out of their seats. Definitely far from a top-tier survival horror, but nowhere near as bad as people make it out to be. Know what the game offers and you shall be not disappointed with what it doesn't offer.","June 4, 2014","true","6.1"," 55 of 64 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","55","64","0","1"

Randomizing the rooms every playthrough so its always different, allowing people who stream it to have their chat activate events, and some other cool little features. Sadly the rest of this game kinda flops and ruins the cool ideas behind this game. Lets start with the graphics and performance, they are both terrible. There is nothing special about this game, so I dont know why this game is so hard to run, even on a higher end PC. Then there is the story, or lack thereof, which hurts the game a lot because it starts off pretty good. However, I think the worst thing about this game is the enemy, the ghost lady who chases you around. She is completely useless. Why? Because she can only damage you when you are looking at her, so I ran through the game on hard without ever dying and barely taking damage.\n\nOverall, this game had a lot of potential, but they dropped the ball on this one. Also feels like they put a lot more effort into aiming this game towards YouTubers instead of the average player, which I feel like is a pretty bad practice.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_Kqwjtprn0","November 1, 2015","false","4.8"," 50 of 58 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","50","58","0","2"

What flaws are these?  Well, it could be construed as a tad repetitious, especially in some of its scenery (though having worked in a number of hospitals, I can tell you that's exactly how they are!), and also in some of its gameplay (find some notes, open a portal, start lookin' for notes again).  It's also a little unclear early on as to what exactly you're supposed to be doing, though once you get the hang of it, you generally know what to do.\n\nThis game seems to have taken a lot of other flack, which I don't necessarily agree with, and which I'll address now.  Firstly, "It's too easy once you work out to just look away from the witches".  Okay, I guess I must be a particularly skittish individual, 'cause I still managed to die a good few times after reading these words of wisdom.  Sure, after a while I got the gist and improved a bit, but the whole idea is you're supposed to PANIC, and not just "calmly" look away, because IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A SCARY GAME.  Something which a lot of these cocky young ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• don't seem to understand:  It requires a bit of suspension of disbelief, a genuine DESIRE to scare yourself, in order to have that effect.  If you give in to that desire, then I believe this game does a VERY good job of scaring you shiteless.  Saying, "Ooh, all you have to do is not look at the witch", is a bit like saying, "All you have to do to stop a great white shark devouring you is punch it on the nose as it's swimming towards you."  Yeah, right.  Like to see you arrogant little turds try THAT one on, sometime...\n\nSecondly, the inevitable "Slender" comparisons.  Okay, YES.  It IS a "Slender" clone.  But for my money, it's probably the BEST "Slender" clone I've played yet...and I've damn well nearly played all of 'em, including "Slender: The Arrival", which certainly ISN'T quite as good as this in my humble opinion.  When I wrote a review for that game, I accused it of "cheating" ('cause sometimes it's just plain dumb luck which leads to ol' Slendy teleporting RIGHT ON TOP OF YOU).  This game plays MUCH fairer, providing a decent enough challenge, but as I alluded to above, if you manage to keep your wits and your nerves under control, you should MOSTLY be okay.  MOSTLY!  And okay, so it ends in a spooky forest, after covering many of the other clich√© horror environments such as hospitals, prisons and sewers, but if you're willing to accept that it's a somewhat DERIVATIVE game, you may just have yourself a pretty good time.  It was compelling enough for me that I finished it in one night, something which I almost never do (not even for a game only a few hours long).  And finally, the asking price of ten dollars is more than reasonable for what you get (the procedurally-generated elements and multiple difficulty levels no doubt granting it some replayability).\n\nMan, if people are seriously inclined to complain about a game of this quality, for this price, we really must be a spoiled ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing bunch...maybe we'd be more grateful if we'd been BURNED AT THE STAKE like them witches, eh?  Then we might actually have something to COMPLAIN about!\n\nVerdict: 9/10.\n\n(Oh, and PS: Fantastic ending!  Though the end credits music which comes on immediately after is a tad abrupt and inappropriate, haha...)","August 3, 2015","true","3.8"," 61 of 82 people (74%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","74","61","82","13","8"

Things have improved drastically over the course of the month and not only does the game enjoy stable frame-rates, I am able to push the graphics detail up without it causing my laptop to fizzle and burn***\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=265593908\nLast year saw Outlast, another horror title set in a seemingly abandoned hospital/asylum hoarding dark secrets, bow to much success which in itself took many cues from Frictional Games much lauded Amnesia: The Dark Descent. Outlast added some interesting tweaks to the gameplay (such as the ability to vault over objects in ones way and be able to look behind you whilst running for your life from the terrors confined at Mount Massive, the asylum you sneak into to investigate). For the most part it worked and it worked really well. I enjoyed my time with it although I did feel it dropped the ball somewhere in the middle (a more refined cut would have gone a long way) and the sudden supernatural ending, whilst schlock-ly entertaining, was far from perfect.\n\nNow cue music - we have another entry from Zombie Studios called Daylight. With its similar setting and trailers that ramp up the fear factor it would be churlish to pass this off as a simple Outlast clone as I initially did (apologies to the friend I disputed this over with). Having gone through the game a second time around I am starting to see that Daylight owes more to the Slenderman series of games than to Outlast or even Amnesia. Daylight cribs generously from Slenderman by having you basically run around the abandoned hospital gathering remnants (Daylights version of the Slenderman white pages) always keeping a close eye out for the spirits that haunt this ground. Daylight is procedurally generated horror title that just goes to prove that procedural and horror should NEVER, EVER be in the same sentence since each area you explore looks exactly like the previous area you just passed through. Plot is certainly not one of Daylights strong points and if former IGN journalist Jessica Chobot believes this is where her career should be headed then she is going to have to try a lot harder.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=256169540\nThe game plonks its main heroine, Sarah, in the above mentioned abandoned hospital and then proceeds to litter the place with glow-sticks. Why glow-sticks? You see glow-sticks help you solve clues but for all I knew and was told Sarah could have been on route to a rave and some kindly rave-type person had left some for other ravers to pick up on-route. So know that I know I am not actually going raving then why am I solving clues? Since exposition is so low on the ground as to be practically dead and buried the player isn't really told much to begin with. There is a clich√©d story of a hospital of horrors that surfaces through notes the player finds in the game world but its literally cut, copied and pasted from every other horror involving an abandoned hospital, a few dead witches and some possibly fruity doctors. These notes fill in the back-story but because this is a story we have all heard a hundred times before (think The Conjuring just set in an abandoned hospital), there really is no need to pay that close an attention. With a plot hacked straight from horror 101 what dialog Daylight does feature is ear-bleedingly awful.\n\nDaylight does succeed on a few jump scares here and there but even those become so telegraphed (the map on the phone you carry will start to distort and you will hear the cackle of the dead witches). Copying the mechanics from Slenderman - these dead witches will oft pop out at you unexpectedly. I really was expecting a whole heap more from this title since the trailers actually made it out to be quite thrilling. The game is literally over within an hour and half and because it's procedurally generated your next adventure will still be the pretty much the same game you just spent 90 minutes wading through in the first place with just a few location swaps here or there.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=268605488\nDaylight serves up every rusty horror clich√© in the book from moving cabinets to boxes being sprewn about as you approach and while I was hoping that Daylight was going to be the horror title for 2014; I have to say I left the game feeling somewhat ambivalent about it. Whilst I was not enjoying myself initially after launch (thanks to a host of game-crunching bugs) - giving the game a second go-around a month later was actually quite fun but still nothing remarkable. Thank the horror-stars that the DLC for Outlast has arrived to scare the crap out of horror game aficionados as Daylight's bark is definitely far worse than its bite. In fact it turns into a bit of a whimper as the game winds down to its conclusion.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","June 8, 2014","true","4.9"," 53 of 69 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","53","69","0","1"

He just spouts out grade-school philosophy such as ‚ÄúLife is but a butterfly‚Äôs dream,‚Äù and ‚ÄúHell hath no fury like a woman scorned‚Ä¶ and you‚Äôve scorned them all.‚Äù With @John_Henry_Eden_ebooks as our good company, we stumble around in the dark hallways (using useless glowsticks and flares) of which you will see the same of many times. One of Daylight‚Äôs big selling points is that it is randomly generated as you play so you can never have the same play experience twice. Well that doesn‚Äôt help when every single room is the same non-memorable one over and over again, does it?\n\nThe goal of every area you visit is to collect 6 ‚Äúremnants‚Äù, which is an absurdly vague way of saying ‚ÄúFind 6 pieces of paper with a red rune on them, some of which will be hidden in boxes on the walls and in desks‚Äù. Once you‚Äôve stuffed enough Macguffins into your jacket, Ol‚Äô Phoney pipes up mentioning that the ‚ÄúSigil‚Äù has been revealed. While that sounds like something deep and meaningful, all it really turns out to be is a pair of surgical scissors or a porcelain doll floating in a room covered in glowing writing that you most likely already found before you had all six remnants. In taking the Sigil, you become defenseless as you are no longer able to whip out any flares or glowsticks to protect yourself.\n\n‚Ä¶oh, right. I forgot something. The ghost. From the outset you‚Äôre being pursued by an apparition that appears out of the blue with little rhyme or reason. My first encounter with it was as follows: I heard a banshee cry out from behind me as I was in mid-turn. My cell phone minimap was beginning to distort with random artifacts and glyphs. I stopped moving and waited for a moment, noticing that I could see what appeared to be the leg of the creature standing there just to my right. I contemplated for a moment what may happen should I continue to turn. All the while it persisted on making weird hissy noises. And then, almost as quickly as it came, the creature disappeared. It felt like one of those hilariously bad special effects sequences in old low budget films where they paused recording while the person or object was moved off camera while everyone else held still before continuing to record to give the illusion that they had vanished in an instant.\n\nYou see, Daylight has a lot of problems. It fails to be truly engaging to the player at any point. All plot exposition is taken care of via the notes and remnants (there are two colors of seal on the paper to designate the difference!) which you can skip most of and most likely will because it is all drivel. Any tension is completely ruined by the fact that none of the game‚Äôs systems work to support each other. Sarah can sprint indefinitely, which makes the ghost a trivial occurrence in the event that it manages to even spawn. Resource management is merely an afterthought thanks to being given free flares and glowsticks in almost every other room. And if you manage to fill up too much on either, finding one in a container causes you to just completely discard it. I‚Äôm pretty sure no human alive is going to just throw out a precious glowstick before finding at least one extra pocket to cram it into.\n\nThe game does not look nearly as demanding as it claims to be and none of the setpieces are visually interesting or even memorable. Between the campy dialog, shoddy notes and head-shake inducing comments in the UI message area claiming ‚ÄúThey will come to haunt you‚Äù, every bit of the writing is downright amateurish and is something to be ashamed of. The in-game Twitch streaming support tells me more about what was on the developers‚Äô minds than anything else in the game. They were banking on the braindead simple stream avenue to perpetuate the game with its enticing look and promise of replayability via randomization.\n\nWhat they forgot to do was make a game worth playing, watching or thinking about.\n","April 29, 2014","false","3.0"," 41 of 54 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","41","54","0","1"

You trudge through some corridors, find sheets of paper and walk away from a ghost lady.  Sometimes you get to watch canned animations when climbing over objects, and very rarely you pull a switch or two to open up a new part of the level.\n\nThe default field of view is atrocious, and there is no menu to change the control scheme, although the FOV can be changed in configuration files, and likely so can the controls.  The lack of accessible menus for these things, however, shows such immense negligence on the part of the developers.\n\nThere's some controversy over getting that Jessica Chobot fellow to write the story for the game.  Except she didn't really write it.  There are a bunch of tiny blurbs scattered everywhere on small sheets of paper that are undoubtedly as original as tiny blurbs can get, but the dialogue can't possibly be attributed to an actual author.  Every single line of dialogue is a platitude that the writer got from somewhere else and thought sounded cool.\n\nBeing a graphical apologist on many levels, I understand that the visuals are fine to look at, but it's rather humorous that this is the first Unreal Engine 4 game to be released.  It looks overall like something you'd find released early in the last console generation, with lots of shortcuts taken, like stacks of books being little more than blurrily textured rectangular prisms, or wood grain textures with the sharpness of cheap plastic.  Little bits like the cloth physics and lighting are much more contemporary, but they don't warrant such steep system requirements, especially since most of the game is set in very tiny corridors.

You pickup on the events of this place through notes scattered throughout the map. This causes constant pauses to read notes, which I stopped doing halfway through, merely picking them up to access the key to progress through the next door. I found they ruined the flow of the game, and didn't offer much info except paranormal activity and the actions of crazed inmates. Nothing you can't imagine on your own.\n\nThe glowstick/flare mechanics are interesting though, yet somewhat broken. It seemed like some cabinets/desks were only discoverable while lighting a glowstick, but on the neat side, they showed your footsteps. That helped you run through the game faster without having to bother with the phone map, as you could tell where you had been.\n\nThe flare wards off the nurse ghost, who will get close to you in most areas because of the tight mapping. She becomes more determined as you advance through each section. You can't use a flare while holding the key object though, so you're forced to make a vulnerable dash to the door. Take that as you will. At one point I was on a dock but I couldn't pick up flares from a box on a wooden post because I apparently couldn't see them, until I lit one. *SPOILER* I then blew a large gas tank to advance, meanwhile I could have just jumped over the damn boxes.\n\nThe areas of this game are formulaic, with repeating assets in each. I had one or two jump scares when the nurse pops up infront of me. I had my settings on medium and it ran mediocre. The key bindings are not changeable, and the FOV is narrow. I tried editing the ini files but it didn't end up working, and carried on with the game.\n\nEnding was terrible.\n\nI'm a fan of survival/horror/adventure but I'd suggest skipping this one.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/recommended/230840/","AestheticGamer","AestheticGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/","3602 products in account","Daylight is a first-person randomly generated survival-horror game. Or how I like to call it, 'Pseudo Pac-Man'.\n\nBasically, this is the game; You got a story area where you're safe, and story things happen, then you get thrown into a randomly generated maze, where you have to find a key, and find the exit. And then rinse and repeat, over and over, until the game is done. They try and throw a few things in to make it more 'interesting', with random scares in mazes and 'puzzles' in the safe areas. But the scares are super weak for the most part, and the 'puzzles' are such riveting things such as, "Push this glowing crate in front of this higher stack of glowing crates," or, "Find the switch to open up this secret door." Riveting.\n\nNow, I may have drawn attention to my Pac-Man example, let me explain... Since most of the horror is a maze, you sort of just waka-waka your way through these mazes, which get larger as the game goes on. You have a map that forms on the phone you always carry in-front of your face as you explore, and as you go there are 'consumable' story pages that you can pick-up (no worries, they freeze gameplay, yo~). And as you explore, there is a ghost that goes after you. And you look for flares, which act like Power Pellets. The ghost AI I noticed while playing will not kill you if you're not looking at it, though. Essentially the ghost approaches you, and when it gets too close and you look at it, you lose. Ghost can teleport around like Slender, and sometimes you'll turn around and it'll be right there and you die. Also, Glowsticks, which you use to make objects you can interact with highlightable.\n\nIt's all fun enough, but hardly scary to me. I was not scared once when playing the game, though was tensed-up during a few closer encounters. It doesn't help that the two main characters (the one who you play as and some guy talking to you on the phone) are very unlikable. You see a chair slightly move. "Ohhhhhhhhh," your character says all scared-like. A tile falls from the ceiling. "Ohhhhhhhh." You start to realize that the character's reacting to try and be 'in-touch' with the player, but it isn't working. She cries to herself that she's scared. She says lines like, "What was that? Was there something behind me?," when clearing there isn't. And says she hears noises when there's no audio at all and stupidly calls out at random if anyone's there, and just... Ugh... I haven't felt this dissonant from a horror protagonist in a long time.\n\nAnd then there's Mr. Guy on the Radio, who was never explained who exactly he was, but you can take some guesses. He's a guy on a radio, who's official occupation seems to be saying cryptic ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• that means absolutely nothing. He'll ring off every once in a while, mostly when you pick up stuff, and rant on like some living Fortune Cookie.\n\nAnd the story is incredibly disappointing, the files are lackluster to decent, and the ending is all kinds of disappointing. I'd tell you the story, but honestly there's hardly any story to tell. I guessed the stories big plot twist literally in the first five minutes of the game. And the story hardly has any presence in the game anyways.\n\nThe randomly generated aspect doesn't feel too needed, as most of the rooms look similar for the most part, and can either make what you're objective is stupidly easy, or a lot harder than it needs to be. I think randomly generated mazes wasn't the best idea on the devs, the game is pretty linear so the random level layout often can make the levels themselves feel rather poor more often than not. Scares and all that I can understand being randomized, but in a game that's at heart a linear corridor horror game, the random feature literally in this case just shifts halls and rooms around.\n\nBut it's decent fun, and it looks fairly pretty. The music is nice. I'd say it's decent if it's cheap, but it's honestly a very mediocre game. It's not terrible or even bad I'd say, I'd just say it falls short.of its promise, and it almost all comes from poor choices. The mechanics are good, and there's groundwork here for a good horror game, but the execution just falls flat a lot of the time.\n\nBuy if cheap and like horror games as it's not terrible, but not worth it full price either, and honestly rather average as a whole.And it feels like a lot of other games that have come out in the last few years.","May 6, 2014","false","1.1"," 21 of 28 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","21","28","0","0"

Me being #13 makes very little sense in the grand scheme except that I'm apparently super natural and somehow related to the other 12. I felt like the end of the game was a frantic attempt to somehow tie everything together by labeling me as Patient 13, an "eerie" coincidence. There was very little "Twist" in finding that out.\nThe way the story was told was, frankly, awful. I'm put through 4 runs of Slenderman page collection mechanics, being forced to read notes to understand half the story while the other half is told by a man over the phone I'm holding whom I assume is Dr. Mercer.\nNext is the dialogue. Between the girl constantly asking if anyone is there when she has clearly seen the other "12" over and over and Dr. Mercer's terrible attempts at being wise with quotes like "No matter where you go, there you are" I was ready to mute voice all together.\nFinally is the graphics. While they weren't bad, I expected much better considering this was a new engine and that what was advertised made the game look much better than it actually was. I consider the graphics in Outlast to be 5x better than what I saw here and it uses an older Unreal Engine.\n\nOverall, I was very unimpressed. It was an extremely short game and not worth $15 at all.

A creepy man barks instructions and vague allusions to her past through the phone, which also acts as a map and a light. Glow sticks can be collected and used for light and double as a basic hint system, casting a soft green glow to highlight item containers or puzzle mechanisms. Flares are the only other usable items and are used to fend off the creepy witch ghost thing that haunts you throughout the game.\nYou know how most horror games like to embellish their worlds with various collectable files or documents that help to fill in the backstory of what is really going on. In Daylight, collecting these documents is the primary mechanic of gameplay. The basic structure of each level goes as follows: find at least five or six of these documents called ‚Äúremnants‚Äù (they are usually briefs notes or the occasional photo), bring the remnants to a designated symbol to acquire a special artifact called a Sigil and then use the Sigil to open a magic barrier and continue on your way. Repeat, again and again and this is the whole game.\nIf this sounds boring, it‚Äôs because it is. Think the main hook from Slender, but stretched out over 60 to 90 minutes.\nThe replay value of Daylight is almost nonexistent, even when taking into account its procedurally generated nature. The thing is, the game itself is so lifeless and devoid of any actual gameplay, that it‚Äôs incredibly hard to justify experiencing the adventure for a second time at all.\nDaylight is the retail debut of Unreal Engine 4 but the graphics look shockingly outdated.\nThe sound effects do not help matters all that much, either. You will have the expected banging on doors and low howls in the distance, but it is Sarah‚Äôs own commentary that ends up being the biggest thing at fault here. Sarah has about three or four different dialogue options that she cycles through densely and incessantly, with weird choices of pausing by the actor like ‚ÄúIs anyone‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶there?‚Äù and ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt see anything!‚Äù and ‚ÄúI know someone‚Äôs there!‚Äù\nIn terms of both a game‚Äôs atmospheric scare factor and enjoyable gameplay, Daylight is essentially a poor man‚Äôs Amnesia, and does not even come close to the current king of the genre, Outlast.\n\nSounds 4/10\nGraphics 4/10\nGameplay 3/10\nAtmosphere 3/10\n\nIf you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curation","May 17, 2014","false","4.1"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","14","18","0","0"

That mechanic is very well thought! I gotta give props where I see them!\n\nThen you have two kind of flares. The green ones to highlight notes scattered around the numerous corridors and you get the red flares who are used to "make the creeping shadows disappears". Again, you have some defense mechanism and is well thought. But if you're out of the red flares, you're done... well not all the time but if you're in a dead end (MANY dead ends in Daylight) and out of these red flares, you're totally screwed! You "die" and somehow respawn somewhere else, with lots of progress lost.\n\nThe procedurally generated levels are mostly all the same thing over and over. Corridors, doors, walls... run and run and run, activate the two kind of flares, gather notes... find a "sigil", basically a KEY to open a blocked path covered with a door marked with a ward.\n\nIf you LOVED Slender, this game is somehow similar, a close clone to it. But, I had enough of wandering around these corridors... maybe someday, I'll give it another chance but as of now, nope! The game feels like a poor tech demo and the bonus is a big migraine for all the eye strains you got!\n\nPROS:+Smartphone act as light source and a map device. Well thought!\n+Flare system is decent and working. I'd love if they could last longer though!\n+Game can be tense at times... especially when you're out of red flares!\n\nCONS:-Poor procedurally generated levels... many dead ends!\n-Running back and forth in corridors, stairs... finding notes and the sigil to progress further.\n-Overused asylum in a "scary game" setting.\n-Bad textures of the Unreal Engine 4. Developers boasted using that marvelous engine yet it doesn't show much!\n\nRECOMMENDATION:I can't recommend this game in its state as it is, even years after release. I was wary of all the bad reviews once the game released back in April 2014 but now, game hasn't much improved if at all and both gamers and reviewers were right in all the bad reputation this game has got.\n\nThere is a few great ideas here but the procedurally generated levels is a bad idea.\n\nHopefully on your next game, you can fix the issues mentionned and I'll be willing to give another shot at your next project!\n\nRATING:4.0 / 10","February 29","false","1.2"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

Each level/section/whatever was simply the exact same thing and literally had nothing unique. The game is seriously short also (can probably rush the game in like 30 mins; but reading everything, you'd probably spend 1 1/2 hours or so).\n\nI was hoping that this would be better than Outlast, but I was left disappointed overall.

I can only count them on one hand.) but it turned out to be another disappointment. Why??? Well, ill attempt to explain why.\n\n\nTHE GOOD\nOne of the good things going for Daylight is the lighting. Daylight has some great lighting, and it shows it off with the use of the different items in the game like the flares.  Another cool thing is most of the environments. From a sewer, to the outside, alot of the areas look pretty good and creepy. The only areas that aren't very good are the first two but besides that, they are very well made environments. One last thing is the sound. Not all of the sound is good and the way most of the sound is used is rather crappy, but many other SFXs are great, and are fitting with the setting. The sound that tells you a ghost is nearby and most of the old, worn out doors are very creepy, and set the mood perfectly.\n\n\nAlso, the way Twitch (Livestreaming) is integrated is neat as well.\n\n\n\nTHE BAD\nHere's where it all goes downhill. one thing to make your game scary is be crafty and paced well. Daylight fails at this. Here are daylights "regular" scares.\n\n- cheap jumps scares\n\n-doors opening by themselves (SPOOOOOKY)\n\n-Objects getting flung around\n\n-and loud screams that get old about the third time they are used\n\nSure, most people will find this scary, but I don't. Jump scares can be scary if done right, but ones that are thrown out of nowhere with no buildup are not scary. Daylight does that so many times its not even funny. As for doors and objects magicly opening or get thrown, its such a done to death cliche I roll my eyes instead of being scared. And the loud screams are pretty self explanatory. The worst part is the gameplay. Here is the entirety of daylights gameplay. 1. Enter level. 2.collect 6 pages. 3.go to the key. 4. Go to exit. 5.rinse and repeat. Sound familiar, doesn't it? Yes, this is pretty much a rip-off of the smash hit horror game, Slender: The Eight Pages (which I don't like either). Not only that, but it gets extremely repetitive later in the game. Another thing that is bad is the lack of enemy variety. The entire game, you're being chased by ONE ghost the whole game, and its design is very bland. Because of this, it adds on to the repetition and bore-factor of the game. One last thing is the story and characters. The story is told through notes and slight (and I mean slight) exposition between levels. I would have been fine with this if not for the fact that it is very bland and uninteresting from start to finish. Most of the notes are either ZOMG I SAW SOMEONE RUN AROUND WHERE I WAS AND IVE NEVER SEEN HIM IN MY LIFE! To ZOMG SOMEONE DIED! It got to the point where reading them felt like a chore. Another thing is that the protagonist is SOOO annoying. I give props for not using the "silent character" approach, but id rather prefer that then this. The entire game Sarah will say "Is anyone there" to "What was that?" And it gets annoying real fast because of how many voice clips are used over and over again.\n\nTHE VERDICT\nWhat a disappointment. It had alot of potential, but wound up being boring and uninspired. 3/10.\n\n\nFor more reviews, check out our True Reviewers Group:http://steamcommunity.com/groups/truereview\n\nI cant believe i bought this instead of The Amazing Spider-man 2.

I got this game for free so I don't really have anything to complain about.\n\nI don't really like the story how it makes no sence and you are pretty much thrown into the game. That is the only flaw.

I'm not big on horror games so for a first one I will say go ahead and get it, it's your choice after all.\n\nTL;DR - Good game for some scares, I got for free so don't any better.

I keep saying that this game could have been the next "Outlast", but falls short of expectations. The hype for this game was the main selling point. This game was created on the new Unreal Engine 4 and should have given us more realistic and terrifying scares. The game is hardely scary and I actually stopped my let's play after one episode. There are points where the game runs at a smooth 30 FPS, but if I so much as try to turn my character, the game freezes or drops the FPS. The game is nearly unplayable as I have found many bugs in the game. My favorite bug is the movable crates. I try to move them to progress through the game and they completely clip through the floor! Thus, making me restart from the last save point. The saving mechanic in the game is very bad. You have no choice but to save when the game wants to. You cannot save wherever you'd like, causing let's players like me to make very long videos. Overall, I didn't finish the game and I probably never will. 3/10 Rating on this game.","April 30, 2014","false","2.0"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

I have everything up to date everything I need the devs told me that I had everything good, and also I passed the diag test tool they give you (since there was such a problem they needed one) I honistly rarely post bad reviews or feel I should get my money back, this is the first time I feel completely screwed. Even Orion dino horde worked better at launch and at least they did fix stuff( saying this because that was also a horrid indie game at release). For running the new UR4 engine from what I am seeing is not very amazing. And the patches they do roll out seem to break things even more or fix one thing break another.\nThis upsets me, being said that I talked to the people who made it and it still failing to change anything and doing all I can to fix it. I wasted my time, and I am not sure it was worth my time to fix from what others are saying. Many people say it runs really really hot on high end rigs even for how bad it looks. This is a Alpha it seems, for being delayed it is not at all finished, I mean even at release the first patch was 1.0 so I do think it was sent out from beta. Yet still doesn't work, heck even with EA I don't have this many problems, and at least they are fixed and not telling you to do the same 3 things 100 times and jump through 200 hoops to play a 2 hour long game about.

As a lot of the dialog doesn't make sense or is misused in certain areas as the player will use the same phrases over an over at random points.\n\nGameplay wise, it's not so bad the core concept of this game actually reminded me of slender combined with the randomly generate worlds which made the first 2 diablos fun mixed in with a few jump scares. Which by the way get pretty predictable but still can catch you off guard from time to time.\n\nSo over all I probably can recommend this game with the disclamer those who are new to the genre such as myself or casual horror genre players who are looking to only get their feet wet.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/smiles-/recommended/230840/","smiles-","Sikopathic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/smiles-/","461 products in account","Daylight: probably one of the strangest names that Zombie Studios could have given it, as there is an immediate scarcity of the stuff. ‚ÄòNighttime‚Äô probably would have been a more fitting title for the game, as it‚Äôs clich√©, much like the rest of the game itself.\n\nDaylight is a survival horror game in which each area is randomly generated upon entering it, thus allowing a different game each time you play through it. Being the first game ever to use the Unreal Engine 4, it has a lot to live up to in order to make it a game to remember.\n\nAs you start, you wake on the floor with no memory of who you are or how you got there. All you have is a phone, which acts as a flashlight, a map and a means of communications for a mysterious voice that guides (or attempts to) you through the game, but rarely actually helps. Instead, the voice either confuses you with riddles or mocks you in some way. After investigating the room, you open a door and discover you‚Äôre in an asylum. You progress past each level by collecting remnants (pieces of paper that contain information of the asylum‚Äôs past.) Once you‚Äôve collected enough remnants, a key appears, which is an object that one of the former inmates were very fond of, like a doll or The Bible. This is used to unlock the doorway and progress to the next level. Not all remnants appear during one playthrough, meaning people who like to 100% games will find joy in playing through it multiple times.\n\nThrough the areas you can find glow sticks and flares. Glow sticks cause objects of interest to glow, whether it is because they can be searched or moved, making them an invaluable tool which you will find yourself using a lot throughout Daylight.\n\nAs you collect more remnants, your threat level gets higher, causing the Witch to appear. There is little to no explanation about why the Witch is there or how she got there. The higher the threat level is, the more persistent she is at attacking and following you. Unfortunately, she is too easy to evade. Lighting flares keeps her away for the duration of the flare‚Äôs light, but merely running in the opposite direction or even running straight past her also suffices, as once you have seen her, she seems to forget the aspect of using her legs, meaning she just stands there gormless until you look away.\n\nI‚Äôm not going to lie though, the moments when she does appear are terrifying, especially when she is dangerously close to you when you see her. The moments when she does appear are pulled off just right, the obvious things such as how the camera pans round to her automatically when she‚Äôs a set distance to you, the sudden music, the scream she lets out to the way she immediately lurches forward slightly once you see her, as if she‚Äôs going to jump through your screen and slap you across the face as you scream like a little ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•.\n\nIf this is sounding scarily (no pun intended) similar to Slender, that‚Äôs because it is. Running around in circles, hearing loud noises until you find all the pages gives a strange sense of d√©j√† vu. Like Slender, the most annoying part of the game is when you have all but one remnant (or page, in Slender‚Äôs case) and you‚Äôre running in circles trying to find the damn thing whilst desperately avoiding whatever it is that is practically hanging off your buttcheeks.\n\nEach level is a different part of the asylum, starting with the hospital, then the prison, then the sewers and finally ending with the forest. These (theoretically) should get harder as they go on, but it goes the opposite way. For me, the hospital was the largest area and was made a lot more like a maze, even to the point of having multiple floors. The game actually gets easier after that. The prison is a rather small area, as are the sewers. The forest is literally that; a big open forest area, meaning getting away is easy, especially as there isn‚Äôt any stamina to limit your running, allowing you to just sprint around until you find an area of interest. I understand that they are randomly generated, but so are the levels in The Binding of Isaac, and they get larger and more difficult the deeper you get, so why can't it be the same here?\n\nThe game itself took me two and a half hours to complete, and about half of that was spent looking for the last remnant in each area whilst avoiding Witch attacks every ten seconds. Point is, if you‚Äôre looking for a long game, Daylight is the wrong place to be looking.\n\nAs I mentioned before, Daylight is the first game to use the Unreal Engine 4, and it has put it to very good use. The environments and game itself is beautiful to look at (except the screaming ladies) and very clearly boasts the power of UE4. Even to things such as how dynamic the lighting is. For instance, at one point I was standing behind a table, trying to regain my composure not long after a Witch attack. As I was standing still, my character started waving the glow stick in her hand around, and as she did, the shadow of the table I was behind moved accordingly to how she moved the glow stick. Just small things like that show the potential of what Unreal Engine 4 can do and really add to the experience.\n\nOverall, Daylight is a game that had the potential to overthrow games like Outlast and Amnesia. Armed with randomly-generated areas and Unreal Engine 4, it should have, but boring and repetitive gameplay, clich√© design, small length and general unoriginality unfortunately let it down massively.\n\n\n\n4.5/10\n\nPro‚Äôs\nLooks brilliant\nBest scares I‚Äôve seen in a long time\nMultiple playthroughs appeal to hoarders\n\nCon‚Äôs\nToo unoriginal\nWay too short\nLittered with horror-clich√©‚Äôs\nGot easier the further I got\nGet‚Äôs boring after a while\n","May 15, 2014","false","5.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Interesting puzzles/change of pace in gameplay as we've seen in Amnesia or Outlast this is not, sadly. =(\n\nThe selling point of 'procedurally generated' maps sounds awesome at first too until you literally stumble across the second or third identical looking room in a row over a 10 minute period.\n\nThe protagonist's VA work of gasps and screams leave alot to be desired, much of the time these come across as eye rollingly cringeworthy, and other times humorous even.\n\nFor one of the first Unreal 4 engine games it certainly doesn't look much impressive either, I actually had to go and google to make sure that this was indeed the one I had heard about using the new engine because of how mediocre and not-at-all special it looked/played.

It‚Äôs being developed by Zombie Studios and it‚Äôs first game which is using Unreal Engine 4.\n\nDespite many previous horror games which are similiar size, Daylight have to provide a lot more. Beside really creepy and scary atmosphere 99% of the time player will not be able to escape their destiny, to be scared !\n\nYou are in control of character who have aweoken in a random abandoned hospital. You have no idea why are you either your female character in that hospital but only way to find out whats happening is to seek notes, documents and possessed messages that find their way to your cell phone. Only navigation and constant light is your cell phone which will be shaking around while you are running so no matter how much you are scared you will need to find safe corners and observe explored map and potential ways to go further deep into level.\n\nYou arent going to have access to any weapons but whatsoever you will have glow sticks which will light green colour and show you clues, your footprints and potential objects with which you can interact, flares which you need to defend yourself from ghosts and all scary things which surrounds you.\n\nGame environment and levels are randomly generated for each time when you die or you simply load a latest checkpoint. Antagonists are randomly spawned aswel which will make you fear even more, every time.\n\nYour goal in each level as it‚Äôs mentioned already is to search for notes and logs from the hospitals past, referred to as ‚Äúremnants‚Äù, by looking for markings using a glow stick. Sometimes by discovering remnants it will make marking on your arms which will attract what you simply dont want.\n\nYou have 2 choices, use your flare and make them disapear for couple seconds or run away as fast as you can without turning around. Sometimes it will take only one turn and it will appear in one corner, believe me you dont want to do that.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXjg1NQxonQ\n\nBy exploring levels you will always find locked door and empty room with a lot of signes all over the place but once when you collect all remnants you will be able to acquire a ‚Äúsigil‚Äù, an item or significance for hospital past, teddy bear or a Bible for example. Once when you have your sigil you will need to run for a door without ability to use your flare or glowing stick which will tear fear in your bones and make your andrenalin go crazy.\n\nOptimization is fairly good especially if you have on mind that this is first game on Unreal Engine 4, graphics are good but not so impressive and most of the time FPS is exactly where you want to be.\n\nWith all that being said it‚Äôs time to conclude this review.\n\nFor around 10 bucks you will get really amazing experiance from this horror game. Dont expect long adventure but you will get enough to be satisfied in all segments including atmosphere and storyline. Replay ability is always there with fact that levels will always be regenerated and random so you will definitely want to play couple times until you dont leave this title in your gaming library. My rating for this game is 85/100 when you look from all aspects which is fairly good and solid title. My recommendations without thinking twice.","April 26, 2014","true","2.1"," 147 of 290 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","147","290","0","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Limit760/recommended/230840/","Limit760","Nolimit760","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Limit760/","153 products in account","Daylight is an Unreal Engine 4 powered survival horror game created by developer Zombie Studios that puts you into the shoes of a woman known only as Sarah. You‚Äôve been abandoned in a hospital with no recollection of how you got there or how you are supposed get out. You‚Äôre prompted by a voice to use your cellphone that acts as a combined GPS and flashlight to find all of the memories within the hospital which come in the form of scraps of paper, notes, and pictures. With the assistance of tools like glow sticks that highlight items of importance like boxes that contain items, valves, and switches; and flares that ward off enemies you make your way aimlessly through the rooms and corridors of this abandoned hospital.\nFirst off I must address the elephant in the room. Daylight by Zombie Studios and Outlast by Red Barrels are indeed similar games and I expect comparisons will be drawn between the two. And as someone who has played through both; I‚Äôll be internally comparing them and this will show within this review.\n\nAnyways, what sets Daylight apart from other games within the genre is the way it handles environments, enemies, content, and encounters. Daylight features a procedurally generated world and is touted to be the same experience twice. The layout of the hospital and prison, spawning of enemies, items you need to obtain and even how you complete these objectives are set to be different for every playthrough. Although some parts remain the same, specifically rooms with switches and the storage / break room, the rest of the environments are random. During my second playthrough I found myself trying to remember where I had gone the first time and this caused me to use up the most precious resource, flares. Speaking of flares, these items are the only things that can ward off enemies so it‚Äôs important to use them sparingly especially when the game scares you into using them when you didn‚Äôt truly need to. This leads directly into sound design and my oh my did Zombie Studios do a fantastic job with that. Daylight executes perfectly in balancing your fear level. Much like a good horror film you reach moments of tension that put you on the edge of your seat, and soon after are lulled into a false sense of safety before once again being put on edge. As you make your way through the halls of the hospital and prison you hear the telltale sound of an enemy approaching from behind you and this happens at random. But what happens is when you hear the sound of an enemy coming up from behind you; the enemy might not be there. This caused me to erroneously use my flares and left me without defenses when the enemies did come.\n\nThe phrase silent protagonist does not apply here as you are constantly updated with the thoughts and feelings of Sarah, you can hear her breathe heavily as the tension rises and even gasps out and yells when trouble is near. As you collect these memories you will occasionally hear the guiding voice which has just the right amount of creepy to leave you with that unsettling feeling. As enemies approach your cellphone, which acts as a mini-map that displays key locations and all the areas you‚Äôve explored begins to glitch and the map becomes difficult to see. Because the mini-map is in your hands there is a degree of difficulty in seeing it when you‚Äôre running which can cause you to walk into dead ends. Now normally this would be an issue in game like Outlast, but in Daylight if you end up cornering yourself you can run through the enemies. This broke the illusion for me, either Sarah is an Olympic distance runner with incredible stamina or the running is a little broken because this entire game can be run through including through and away from the enemies. While this certainly helped in my second playthrough, it completely killed the tension that is integral to what makes Daylight a survival horror game. This made the entire outside area a complete joke. Let it be noted that you can ‚Äúdie‚Äù in this game. Once I discovered I could just run away from the enemies I thought that it meant that nothing would happen if I stood still to let the enemies ‚Äúget me‚Äù. Of my two playthroughs I only died once and it was only to see if it could actually happen.\n\nThe entirety of my first playthrough lasted roughly two and a half hours, much of this time was spent reading every piece of paper and discovering all the memories that I could. But my second playthrough was completed after just 38 minutes. The game stops you from running through by forcing you to collect a certain amount of remnants that are scattered out throughout the level, once those remnants are collected you must then retrieve the ‚Äúsigil‚Äù, an item of important like a bible, or a teddy bear and bring that to the locked spooky gate. This is repeated four or five times and then the experience is over. It becomes a pattern that can be solved rather quickly and frankly it gets a little boring. The thing that would slow me down would be the layout of the hospital and prison solely because it is randomly generated.\n\nOn my first playthrough I ran into difficulties playing the game after reaching a waterfall area, if I was to look at the waterfall room directly my computer would completely lock up with the only solution being a hard reset. I got past this issue by looking at the ground and walking aimlessly until I found my way through that part. This was an odd issue that could only be replicated on my computer whose hardware was just a tiny bit better than the ‚Äúminimum‚Äù specifications required. However, on my second playthrough I used a computer that had exceeded the ‚Äúrecommended‚Äù specifications and only noticed a slight performance drop during this waterfall area. The biggest issue here is that it if you crash or stop playing at this waterfall junction; you are returned to the beginning of that section which takes a good 10-15 minutes to get back to. I am not deducting any points here for this, but it was something I had experienced in my review experience. This review was using a beta version of Daylight so this must also be taken into consideration.\n\nDaylight is a great example of what a small dedicated team can do. Daylight will leave you feeling uneasy and wanting more. With excellent sound design and great looking environments thanks to Unreal Engine 4, Daylight should be a game that you‚Äôll want to play over and over, but because of the whole ‚Äúfind X number of items and proceed to the gate‚Äù mechanic you‚Äôll only want to play it once. On a second playthrough the game becomes a chore and what was creepy and scary in your first playthrough become a joke. Although you won‚Äôt get too much replayability I would still recommend anyone who enjoys the survival horror genre should give it a try. Daylight releases on April 29th for both PC and PlayStation 4 for just $15.00.\n\n75/100\nGood\n","April 29, 2014","true","5.8"," 51 of 100 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","51","100","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/freshmanfox/recommended/230840/","freshmanfox","FreshmanFox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/freshmanfox/","62 products in account","If a horror game is valued on how scary it is, then Daylight is scary good. When I was a little kid, I always thought that horror stuff is just some comedy thing for me.\n\nDaylight made me stop thinking that way.\n\nI jumped 3 times within one hour of gameplay, and was subconsciously thinking "oh please no more of those Shadows". I even felt relieved after I stop playing it.\n\nThe gameplay was simple. Find Remnants, get the Sigil and unlock the lock. However, as you search desperately for those Remnants, you will be bombarded by noises that makes me search for the source of the noise, just so I can breathe easier. Things gets worse, however, when your smartphone, which is your source of light that doubles as your map, gets distorted. It is a sign that means you have to prepare to be terrorized. And yes, it is what caused me jump 3 times.\n\nDaylight doesn't put much into its storytelling, however. Remnants have a little bit of text that might explain some things, but it wasn't made very clear what was all of this mess about. It means that the only source of suspense in Daylight is its horror factor, not story. It was somewhat disappointing, but a game whose experience-between-games are never the same are ill suited to receive a story.\n\nGraphics-wise, it was fine. The Unreal Engine 4 draws shadows and textures finely, but user interface can be improved to give a better ambience. However, objects may fall somewhat awkwardly, to which I question about the ragdoll physics. It's still good, nevertheless.\n\nThe audio for Daylight is pretty solid. The SFX for falling objects, disturbances and when the Shadows are attacking you is fairly good. VO isn't bad either; the main character speaks lines at pretty much random intervals, but it was made clear that she was scared and tried to put up a front at times, just so she can stay alive. There is no music in-game, but the menu music was describing the ambience fairly well.\n\nSimply put, Daylight is good. If you're thinking that horror games don't scare you, try Daylight.","April 30, 2014","true","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Now, I'm not a person who gets scared easily at all.  This game in my opinion, is very slow paced;  Half the campaign is to get some teddy bear or key and raise it up in the air to open the next door and continue on and do the same.  Don't get me wrong though, it gave off very chilly vibes and the dialogue was astonishing.  On the other hand, the framerate I was getting on this game was a little lower than expected.  When I play this, it feels like I'm playing a sort of puzzle or maze game.  The game wasn't as scary as I thought it would be, but then again, it's very difficult to get me screaming.

Weird errors, crushing last Nvidia drivers, not being able to close the hanging application (and having to restart PC) - all this was really disappointing. But, hey I DID manage to run the game in the end, right? Have no clue how - one day it just start working. Before that I tried to reinstall drivers and checked my directX, read forums, etc. - didn't help. Both 1.0 and 1.1 versions didn't work. Now 1.1 does.\n\n2. The game is generic and not scary. Play Outlast, Amnesia or first Silent Hills for scares. Monster (s) are not scary, scares are not scary, protagonists remarks are the same all the time and it breaks the atmosphere.\n\n3. Graphics are so-so. I mean, this suppose to be U4 engine? Not inspiring textures, so-so lighting, etc. Of course, it is indie project. But why U4? Sometimes Unity games looks better. And most of the time I hold a glow-stick. So the game is green for the most of the time...\n\n4. Running. All you do in game is run. From room to room. That's it. No hiding, no fighting, no jumping. Running only.\n\nI'm a horror fan and I have nothing (horrible) to play. So I'll finish this game. Because of the story. Till now it's kinda interesting. But I can't recommend this game for the average player. Horror fans only. And only if you have nothing to play.\n\nP.S.: It's not a proper game. More like a spatial storytelling case study. Game design teachers would be happy to play it. The game utilizes technology to create media-unique experience. But it lacks personality, emotions and characters to care for.\n\nEDIT: Finished the game. Dumb writing. Can't understand what really happened in the game, who is the voice, talking to main character, etc.","May 4, 2014","false","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Hidden around each level are "remnants", sheets of paper which glow read in the dark. You can see how many you have next to an icon in the bottom right corner of the screen.\n\nWhen you have them all you have to find a key item which then allows you to exit the level. All the time you are being chased by shades which you can dispell with flares, which you will find dotted around each level.\n\nYou will also find glowsticks which, as well as illuminating your surroundings, show you objects which can be manipulated: climbable blocks; searchable boxes etc. Environments in the playthrough I did include an old hospital, catacombs, a beach, and forest.\n\nAt the end there is a reveal of sorts but it is brief and confusing but interesting nontheless.\n\nIf you stream the game on twitch, it responds to things people type in chat, producing 'scary' sounds and events in response to various keywords people type. Apparently, I was never quite sure if it worked.\n\nMight give it a replay to see how much things change with a new iteration.","April 30, 2014","true","4.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For starters, it is way too short.  Depending on whether you hold down the sprint key or take your time, the game can be anywhere between an hour and a half to two and a half hours long.  You have infinite sprint and using it allows you to escape enemies, so there is no reason not to hold down sprint all the time unless you want to soak in the atmosphere.  Taking your time makes things a bit scarier and so I recommend it, but later on this game will not allow you to do that anyway.  It sabotages itself by forcing you to be constantly running when it would be much better to build up suspense by allowing you to slow down.\n\nThe next major problem it has is that there is no variety in the gameplay.  You must walk around and locate a pre-set number of notes marked by red glowing symbols.  Once you collect enough notes, an item will appear.  You must collect the item and carry it to a door where it will allow you to proceed to the next area.  Then you must repeat this process again.  Once you do this about 5 or 6 times, the game is over.\n\nThere is also only one enemy in the game and it infinitely re-spawns, meaning you will very quickly get used to it.  It's genuinely scary for at least the first 2 levels, but after that, the enemy is thrown at you so often that it becomes more annoying than anything else.\n\nThe developers tried to throw in other scares such as loud noises, hallucination sequences, and objects being moved in front of you.  These are frightening the first few times but are used so often that they also become old very fast.\n\nOverall, this game was a disappointment.  It was genuinely scary at first but quickly got old.  Buy it, but only on sale for at least 66% off.  Don't pay full price for it.","April 29, 2014","false","8.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Then when I actually got into it... there was about an hour of gameplay with nothing but cheap jumpscares.  Atmosphere is alright, but it wears thin when you realize 'procedurally generated' means using the same four or five cells over and over for each area in a nonsensical pattern (which I suppose is good for fans of the Cube movies). You will never, ever feel any actual danger from lack of light or even coming in direct contact with the game's group of duodecaplet ghosts (seperate entities but all completely identical).\nThis game was lazily designed and the story is about as interesting as going from point a to point b with some ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•t twist ending where point b was actually point a all along.\nDon't waste your money.","May 13, 2014","false","1.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It really reminds me of slenderman the game, its the like same type of game but at a variant. The game is very good on the first few levels but drastically drops through later into the game and because its a horror game, once you get used to it, the scare factor wont be as effective since the beginning.

The game worked fine for me without any crashes, although I did encounter a small lag spike near the end, it was not game breaking.\n\nI very much enjoyed this game. It's nothing "new" you're in a haunted hospital, trying to escape, and the graphics are average. However it did succeed in putting fear into my mind and absorbing me into the game. And found my heart beating fast as I made a break for the door once I got the "key". As ending, which I will not reveal here for spoiler reasons, I feel was very well pulled off.\n\nI feel this is a one playthrough game though, unless you generally enjoy mazes as the best part of the game is reading the various notes scattered throughout the rooms and hallways.  The maze itself does change with each playthrough so if mazes are your thing, this game will have infinite replayability. For the cheap price, I would definitely reccomend buying this game.","May 1, 2014","true","1.4"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

I'm more of a sci-fi/fantasy horror guy; stuff like Resident Evil and Left 4 Dead. Mainly because the jump scares are less something lurking around the corner or that huge beast that busted through the door, but something running across a doorway or something magically appearing behind you. I kind of hate that.\n\nFor starters, since I only just got started, I can say this game doesn't scream next-gen, but it subtly whispers it to you. You'll notice no jaggies or sharp edges popping out at you. And I don't even remember there being a tessellation setting. The game performs well on a 7970@1440p only stuttering occasionally, otherwise the slowness seems more a design choice as even with the controller sensitivity cranked up. You can imagine a game with this engine that has a superior art team.\n\nUpdate: After playing a while, it's okay, kind of creepy--dig the atmosphere--but again, I don't really like these types of scares. Some of the level design indoors seem very repetitive, like I had no idea aside from the map where to go because it all started to look alike. I read somebody say it was partially randomly generated, but why? The levels are pretty small.\n\nAnd there are "levels" you can clear. It seems like a better design choice would have been to have an open mansion or hospital or whatever. You use your glowstick, find 4 remnants in the first two stages and them find the special item I can't remember the name of. Level clear. Whatever. I was more interested in the game as a no combat thriller using Unreal 4 than I was of it being an actual game.\n\nAt $10 perhaps I'd recommend it like a phone or tablet game. I'm going to play it like a casual horror game to pass time, get a few scares and enjoy Unreal 4.\n\nI had to get this, even with the Unreal 4 demoes available I had to just see what it can do. Now I'm semi-excited for Arkham Knight, even though it's a console optimized game. Hopefully they'll allow PC gamers to ratchet up the settings as they see fit. I will say this game immediately makes the fans on my 7970 spin up. I guess Unreal 4 must be more parallel as it must immediately start to put the card to work just for stuff like lighting calculations alone. I hope devs keep pushing our cards like this with well optimized games so PC can stand above console legitimately, not just with ports.","October 19, 2014","true","1.4"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

There is very little to offer in this horror game except a marketing tool. ‚ÄúDaylight‚Äù will frustrate you just as much as it will frighten you.\n\n‚ÄúDaylight‚Äù places players in an abandoned hospital, where they play as a woman named Sarah. She wakes up clueless and disoriented, with only a cell phone and a few glow sticks and flares to guide her in the dark. With only a mysterious voice giving her vague clues, she must explore the hospital and discover its history before she is able to escape.\n\nThis kind of story has been told before in survival horror games, and ‚ÄúDaylight‚Äù hardly offers anything different. With a worn-out setting like a hospital, one can already expect things like evil doctors and crazy patients, making things predictable.\n\nThe gameplay is simple and easy to learn. Players have to use their cell phone light, glow sticks and flares to navigate through the dark halls of the hospital. Shadow people will randomly appear throughout the hospital as the game moves on. Being caught by them is almost an instant game over. Players can run away or toss a flare at them to make them disappear.\n\nPlayers will have a difficult time figuring out what to do, as the game provides no clear indication of what to do or where to go. The clues provided are vague and will have you literally running around in the dark hoping you‚Äôre on the right track.\n\nA big problem with ‚ÄúDaylight‚Äù is the lack of a save function. Players can only save their progress by reaching a checkpoint. There is no indication of where or when you have arrived at one, making it frustrating when the shadow people catch you.\n\nThe game‚Äôs music and sound is frightfully amazing. It‚Äôs eerie and quiet, and the unsettling sounds mixed with the subtle but tense music really pulls you in the game‚Äôs world. When you run, you can hear the soles of your shoes scratching the floor. The audio cue for nearby shadow people is a quick and loud screeching, making the player look around at where they are coming from. ‚ÄúDaylight‚Äù gets the music and sounds right, but doesn‚Äôt make up for the game‚Äôs lack of direction.\n\n‚ÄúDaylight‚Äù was something that should have never seen the light of day. It offers nothing new or unique to the genre. Players can stumble through the game in about three hours and leave it in the dark after they are finished. It is exclusive to PS4 and PC. Even priced at a measly $15, I still suffer from buyer‚Äôs remorse.","May 23, 2014","false","1.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dawnclover/recommended/230840/","dawnclover","LORD GIYGAS","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dawnclover/","802 products in account","(Personal Score & Reasons to buy down below)\n\nDaylight promised a lot of things, and most of those things weren't delivered. But let's not focus on what it should have been, but on what it is. I am a huge horror fan, and I have probably played most of the horror games out there, or at least tried them.\n\nDaylight is procedurally generated, which is a double edged sword, on one hand, you have supposedly unlimited ways to get scared, but here lies one of the biggest gripes of the game for me: there's not enough variation on the scares. 30 minutes in I had experienced most of the random scares more than once each. The same whispers play over and over, there's only a number of times that a chair moving or something falling will be scary, and then there are some very awful jump scares. So it got tiresome a bit. What kept the game very tense and kept me on edge at times was the sound design and a couple of times where the witch was chasing me. That said, the ambience is top notch, and so is the soundtrack and sound design.\n\nAnother gripe I have with the game is that the main character talks too much. Again, there's only a number of times that you can hear your character (for whom you feel nothing) comment on something or just saying "I know you're in here!" - which totally breaks immersion. That said, I liked that they added the commentary, since I felt it gave a bit of humanity to the character, but it should have been kept to a minimum.\n\nAnd now this is a personal complaint: I am a fan of exploring and I like to take in the atmosphere, but in Daylight you can just turn on a glowstick and it will tell you where everything is by making it glow. I think this makes the game way too easy, since you're just wandering around and collecting remnants (more on that later) and picking up glowsticks and flares. I felt that this was too much handholding. The glowsticks even illuminate the beautiful and dreadful environments more for you, which takes a bit away from the ambience (it changes it a lot). I like the flares though, you use them to scare the witch away (even though it makes it a bit easy, although they can be a bit scarce at higher difficulties) and I really like how they light up the environments. And this brings us to the witch: I think it's awful that on easier difficulties, during the first levels she cannot kill you (false sense of security? No. Just stupid), and I felt that on later levels and higher difficulties it just became too hectic, the tension wasn't given time to grow, it was just jump scare after jump scare, and that's a smaller gripe I have with the game. I say smaller, because this made it extra difficult to explore the environments and that made me frustrated, and I say that in a good way because that actually achieved the tension that the game should achieve even for people who are not fond of exploring. It worked for me, but it won't work for everyone.\n\nYou progress through the game by repeating a simple objective: grab X amount of remnants to spawn an object that serves as a key to a door that is locked by a force field while evading the witch, whose aggressiveness goes up as you grab the remnants. The remnants are, by the way, notes that fill out the story of the game. Seems familiar? It's almost a glorified Slender clone in terms of gameplay, and although I like Slender (heck, I even developed a Slender clone as my first game with my team) it has been overused and this just feels lazy from the developers' part. They could have easily brought more variety to the gameplay to make the game feel more unique.\n\nNow on to the story: it is GOD awful. I consider the story one of the most important elements of a horror game, it brings that extra spice to the atmosphere through context, and this game is an awful example of it. The story, albeit not horribly written is completely uninspired and clich√©. They picked up every clich√© from a couple of popular horror movies and built something with no heart and no soul. I saw a lot of Poltergeist there, and even a bit of Silent Hill, if we touch on horror games too. I felt nothing for the characters, because they were barely characters. I could hear Sarah breathe and comment on some situations that happened during the game, but I could not FEEL her character. Why should I care that she was brought here? Heck, why was she brought here? Who the hell is this dude talking to her through the phone, why is he talking to her, why is she not questioning that he is talking to her, why is she not questioning that she has been sent into this creepy old ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• hospice and WHY WHY WHY? Etc. You get the point. And then the ending comes (no spoilers) and you're just left speechless due to probably one of the worst endings in the history of entertainment (IMO). And probably shortest too.\n\nThat said, Daylight is still entertaining and worthwhile if you're a horror fan and want to get your fix, but wait for a sale. I finished the game in 4 hours and a half, found most of the remnants (all the remnants available during the playthrough) and, to be honest, I don't really feel like playing it again so soon. I might go for another playthrough just to see how much it changes, but I will only play it again in a few months up to a year. Getting more of the story is not really an incentive to go through again since the story is not good, and the fact that the layout changes does not change much of the core gameplay since the objectives are always the same and so is the witch's behavior.

However, the game is so unstable and crashes so often that I can't get into the game very far, which is a SUPER huge disappointment.\n\nFrom what I can tell you, Daylight consists of wondering corridors and hallways.  Periodically, pictures move, lights flicker, and wheelchairs roll past your path.  The story seems disjointed as do the characters reactions to most of what happens.  The mystique of an unfolding plot with interesting material is not really apparent in the game as far as I've played it.  Additionally, for having used the latest greatest Unreal Engine, the game doesn't look much better than say Metro Last Light.  In fact it looks worse in my opinion but runs much worse.\n\nOverall, a huge disappointment of a title.\n\nTL:DR:  Incredibly unstable and buggy (expect crashes), disjointed reactions from the character, lack of interesting plot dynamics, and HUGE system requirements but looks less impressive and runs worse than other games with similar requirements.","April 30, 2014","false","5.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","4"

Things go bump, and you hear noises and apparitions sometimes appear behind you or at the end of a hall providing a good jump scare.\n\nBut that's about it. I spawned in a hospital of some kind an ran around a bunch of hallways. I found 5/6 "remnants" which were pages strewn about the level. None of these pages seem to tell a cohesive story and they are all just random 'spooky' notes.\n\nI went through the entire area available to me like 3 times, even using the maze trick where you only make left turns unless forced otherwise, and I was still unable to find the items I needed to progress. Even after I found 6/6 remnants I still could not progress past a door blocked by a glowing symbol. This is not good level design, its like being lost in a crappy maze, where every hallway looks identical, and every prop and piece of scenery seems to repeat its self over and over in different locations.\n\nI wouldn't really reccomend this game. It's not fun and it's confusing. Even with a map it's very hard to tell what areas you have explored and what areas still might lie undiscovered.

It's much like being caught in one of thoe Maize Mazes in the countryside in summer. At first they are ok but it soon wears off as you go around and around, looking at the same thing, over and over. Yet, with Daylight we get a story, which isn't much. I played this for about an 40 mins and basically I couldn't take anymore. The graphics are really poor, despite having everything set on max and having a good system to run it on. I was hoping that given that this was one of the firsr games to use the new engine we would see something different, but instead it's really rather poor. Granted the game is cheap, but seriously, there are much better games on Steam and elsewhere that deserve your money. Polygon rated this as a 5 and I thought that perhaps they were being harsh.

I'm more of a sci-fi/fantasy horror guy; stuff like Resident Evil and Left 4 Dead. Mainly because the jump scares are less something lurking around the corner or that huge beast that busted through the door, but something running across a doorway or something magically appearing behind you. I kind of hate that.\n\nFor starters, since I only just got started, I can say this game doesn't scream next-gen, but it subtly whispers it to you. You'll notice no jaggies or sharp edges popping out at you. And I don't even remember there being a tessellation setting. The game performs well on a 7970@1440p only stuttering occasionally, otherwise the slowness seems more a design choice as even with the controller sensitivity cranked up. You can imagine a game with this engine that has a superior art team.\n\nUpdate: After playing a while, it's okay, kind of creepy--dig the atmosphere--but again, I don't really like these types of scares. Some of the level design indoors seem very repetitive, like I had no idea aside from the map where to go because it all started to look alike. I read somebody say it was partially randomly generated, but why? The levels are pretty small.\n\nAnd there are "levels" you can clear. It seems like a better design choice would have been to have an open mansion or hospital or whatever. You use your glowstick, find 4 remnants in the first two stages and them find the special item I can't remember the name of. Level clear. Whatever. I was more interested in the game as a no combat thriller using Unreal 4 than I was of it being an actual game.\n\nAt $10 perhaps I'd recommend it like a phone or tablet game. I'm going to play it like a casual horror game to pass time, get a few scares and enjoy Unreal 4.\n\nI had to get this, even with the Unreal 4 demoes available I had to just see what it can do. Now I'm semi-excited for Arkham Knight, even though it's a console optimized game. Hopefully they'll allow PC gamers to ratchet up the settings as they see fit. I will say this game immediately makes the fans on my 7970 spin up. I guess Unreal 4 must be more parallel as it must immediately start to put the card to work just for stuff like lighting calculations alone. I hope devs keep pushing our cards like this with well optimized games so PC can stand above console legitimately, not just with ports.","October 19, 2014","true","1.4"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

Talk about a stinker... Daylight reminds me of the old Quake II Mods in it's simplicity and looks. It's scary for a second and then it's done. Daylight is akin to a knock knock joke, when you hear it the first time you laugh... the second time, you groan... the third time you just want to punch the person telling it in the face. In Daylight,  once you see the spooky, Ring girl once, it creeps you out, you laugh and the game is over; because after the first time she scares you - well, that's it, the surprises are done and it's the same thing over and over and over and over and over.... You get the point. Save yourself some time and money by having a kid tell you a knock knock joke and then go play Myst instead of buying, installing and "playing" this hunk-a-jalopy. You will get more far more entertainment that way. Glad this bomb came free with a vid card.\n\nPS, why this game required the Unreal 4 engine is beyond me... This game could have been made with the same engine they use for the game SIN, remember that stinker?","May 14, 2014","false","1.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It has everything I wanted for a decent price.  It's not anything that's going to change the genre or something you *MUST* experience.  It certainly delivered on anything advertised and *I* enjoyed it.  The replayability of it is part of the fun, as I can't memorize the maps and such.  Even dying and respawning, would change parts of the puzzles into different areas.\n\nNow, for the more depth review.  You wake up with a cell phone and some guy talking to you presumably through the cell phone.  You get glowsticks that you can use which will highlight things you can get.  You get flares that you can use that burn ghosts and such.  Those are the basics, the puzzles are simple, I almost always had a glowstick out as they were very numerous, and only ran out of flares once at where I ended up dying.\n\nDodging the ghosts is simple, you can usually hear them and turn your back to them and walk past them backwards or whatever, it seems you must look at them for them to be able to kill you.  You can run past them and a whole lot of things.  No hiding places like in Outlast, that I could find.  The game is ridiculously simple.  You just progress by finding "remnants" (basically information written by people), when you've found the required amount of remnants, you then need to find the "sigil" which acts as a key to enter a puzzle area, where you are challenged with some little puzzle and more "remnants" to find, and you progress to the next area that requires more remnants and a new sigil, etc.. etc.. until you beat the game.\n\nYou start over and it happens again, the rooms are randomized, the locations of the remnants seem to be, as do the sigil rooms, and locks, and the puzzles have some randomization to them.  The graphics are nice, ths special effects are nice, the game is a simple $15 game that is designed to cause fear with an odd story that made some sense, but not enough to be important.  Once I beat the game the first time, I don't even read the remnants or anything, I just run through the whole game.\n\ntl;dr - Game is fun and scary, short, and simple.  If your system can handle the graphics and you want a simple $15 game designed to scare you, it should work.  If you're going in looking for an intriguing story like Amnesia: The Dark Descent or Anna, you're really not going to find one here.  Personally, I enjoyed it, the hype around it was far too high, for what it ultimately was, however I still recommend it, even at $15.","May 1, 2014","true","6.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

It's also a good looking game, but a little power-hungry; Likely due to UE4's DX11 effects.\n\nDaylight is a game of discovery, so I highly recommend playing without any advance knowledge or expectations. That's how I went into it, and I enjoyed it much more than I would have otherwise. Expect a 2-4hr playthrough.\n\nThe checkpoint-saving system can be annoying due to a lack of "Save and Quit" option, but you learn to deal with it. Also, you can't rebind the controls.

A part from just the typical WASD, you have just a few other options (flare, glowstick, throw and map.

A few things to note, the game was built on Windows 8, 64bit architecture, DirectX 11 and ran on at least an Nvidia GTX 6 series (and above). Compare it to anything less than this and the game looks very different, plays poorly and downgraded (will look and play like a games console game ...ewww) :Eye_tv:\n\nFinal review TBC","April 29, 2014","true","5.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Graphics are outstanding.\n\nWhile the graphics are outstanding I can't say the same for the in-game mechanics. Don't get me wrong. They are smooth as hell, but they don't give you the freedom you payed for ;) EX.: You can't crouch. Neither jump. Just run ,push and climb.\n\nAnother flaw of the game is that if you stay were you are and the entity is behind you can stay there and she/he will be gone. So there's no point if she/he follows and then he/she goes away because you didn't turn around.\n\nApart from that the overall game is interesting. I bought it when it was 9.99 bucks so it worth it. I give it a 6/10.","May 8, 2014","true","1.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

My mates eventually talked me into playing through it while I was hanging with them and the horror value of the game stayed high throughout the game.\n\nThis game may not inflict the fear in other players but it definitely did a good job at scaring me and I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good horror game.","April 4, 2015","true","0.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I dont usually do that ever...but I've been following this game for awhile.  It seems promising. Procedurally generated levels every time you play = differant game every time.  Scary setting with nothing but a phone light and glow sticks to protect you. Seemed pretty interesting.  I played it for about an hour wasn't terribly impressed.  I was a bit scared at times sure, but not terrified as I wandered the hospital looking for items.\n\nGameplay revolves around going from floor to floor finding notes. Once you've found 6 notes on for each level or "board" you go to a certain room that has an item of one of the insane people. You pick it up and carry it to a special locked door that allows you to progress to the next "board".\n\nThat in a nutshell is the gameplay. Along the way you find glowsticks that show hints if you really need that.  All you do is click on everything, desks, cabinets, cupboards, whatever.  It gets very tedious very quickly.  There are some jump scares but  those are all that will get you the least bit frightened.  I only paid 10 bucks for it so its not terrible for a game like this. I just doubt i'll get 10 hours of enjoyment.  More like 2.  That equals 5 bucks per hour of entertainment. I guess for a video game thats not terrible, I just would've wanted more gameplay variety.\n\nFor a game like this it works, it really does. Its not annoying like outlast, where your camera light runs out of batteries after 5-6 minutes. You dont have to worry about battery power. You don't worry really about much at all.  Just click on all the doors, explore the hospital and pick up all the notes.\n\nIn conclusion I think its not a terrible buy.  Get it now while its on sale. Its not worth more than 10 bucks.","April 29, 2014","false","2.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Very low framerate (10-20 fps).\nThis is on a i7 processor with a Nvidia GT545 card with 8gb RAM.\nSame computer plays Arma 3 at native 1920x1080 at 45-50 fps & Outlast at same, gfx set to high at 40-45 fps\n\n2. Non-programable controls.\nWhat decade are the Devs stuck in? I use a Razor Nostromo that is already setup for up, down, left, right and custom keys that I use for all my other FPS games. Suddenly you force me to use WASD? Thats fine if you're developing at Flash game. For crying out loud Doom and Wolfenstein 3d allowed for custom control configs.\n\nI tried to play this for about 3 hours maybe and spent most of my time trying to figure out what was worng with the engine and framerate/stutter when looking left-right issue. I have DX11.1, latest drivers, low textures, low res.... every setting imaginable = no joy. Finally gave up.\n\nI've waited a month to see if the Devs would complete this botched launch. Sadly they have not. I would like the money back (14.99) BUT not from Steam. I would like the Devs (Zombie Studios) to cut me a check as I feel they knowingly foisted an incomplete product with a broken engine onto the unsuspecting Valve guys.

I really wanted to like this game. Very disappointed.\n\n1. Stutters terribly. Very low framerate (10-20 fps).\nThis is on a i7 processor with a Nvidia GT545 card with 8gb RAM.\nSame computer plays Arma 3 at native 1920x1080 at 45-50 fps & Outlast at same, gfx set to high at 40-45 fps\n\n2. Non-programable controls.\nWhat decade are the Devs stuck in? I use a Razor Nostromo that is already setup for up, down, left, right and custom keys that I use for all my other FPS games. Suddenly you force me to use WASD? Thats fine if you're developing at Flash game. For crying out loud Doom and Wolfenstein 3d allowed for custom control configs.\n\nI tried to play this for about 3 hours maybe and spent most of my time trying to figure out what was worng with the engine and framerate/stutter when looking left-right issue. I have DX11.1, latest drivers, low textures, low res.... every setting imaginable = no joy. Finally gave up.\n\nI've waited a month to see if the Devs would complete this botched launch. Sadly they have not. I would like the money back (14.99) BUT not from Steam. I would like the Devs (Zombie Studios) to cut me a check as I feel they knowingly foisted an incomplete product with a broken engine onto the unsuspecting Valve guys.

However, after you figure out how the scares are triggered, they're fairly easy to avoid. While this is a disappointment, the ones I was not expecting gave me a nice surge of adrenaline.\n\nDaylight generates randomly, but occassionally breaks. I had to reload two levels during my playthrough when the "key" room failed to spawn. Additionally, I often had to start the game up twice to get it to actually load when I selected "Resume Story". Minor annoyances, but annoyances nonetheless.\n\nDaylight is about finding a set number of pages with a story on them, collecting the key that spawns subsequently, and getting the hell out of dodge before the ghosty-goo catches you. Every level repeats this pattern with the ghost getting more aggressive as you progress. Most levels, however, are not that grand and you can beat the level (without dying) in about ten minutes. It's fun, but not groundbreaking.\n\nBottom line: If you have fifteen bucks you're itching to spend, you're patient with getting it to start and know it will work with you PC, you don't mind playing in the dead of night with the lights off and the sound way up, and you can give yourself to the story, give Daylight a try. If technical glitches and repetitive horror aren't your thing, go elsewhere. I recommend it based on a few good scares it gave me, but can understand why others do not. For fifteen bucks I can say I got what I paid for.\n\nMy Playthrough on YouTube","May 4, 2014","true","2.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Starting with twin screens (Oculus Rift mode), just open your local directory for the game and go into plugins and remove the "OculusRift" file.\n\n2. Crashing when starting story mode. For me the problem was "Alien FX" as soon as I put this in "Go Dark" mode it worked fine.\n\nNow as for the game itself, your placed in an abandoned hospital just trying to work out why or how you got there in the first place. If your into your "Paranormal" experiences then you'll proberly enjoy this one, yeah it can be a pain in the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• to get it working and yeah its only about 2-3 hours long but its quite enjoyable overall.\n\nAs you play the game you go around reading notes, which tell you about the hospitals patients or photos of the area itself, some of these notes you have to collect to move onto the next area which are called "Remnants", but as you collect more of these the higher your threat level becomes making encounters all the more likely, and your defense is just a flare.\n\nNot amazing but not bad either, graphics are decent aswell.","April 19, 2015","true","3.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It does not pretend to be Outlast, and I highly doubt it was ever intended to be compared to Outlast (even though it is, rather frequently). Sure, it's in an asylum as well, but that's hardly an original idea on Outlast's part. As for the light source, in Outlast, the camera was useless until you held it up to your face to record and/or switch the nightvision on; in Daylight, the phone light is on all the time and does nothing other than map the area. In reality, the phone in Daylight is functionally closer to the lantern in Amnesia.\n\nBasically, this game is NOTHING like Outlast.\n\nIf you ask me, this game plays much more similarly to that Slenderman game where you're gathering pages in the woods (right down to how you gather remnants in each area before performing a ritual and moving on). Compared to Outlast, this game is the epitome of lameness, but when compared to that Slenderman game (which I did not care for in the slightest), it is rather brilliant.\n\nTaken as a whole on its own, the game is rather middling, but it sets out to tell a story (which it does, even if it is cliche as hell) and make you jump (which it also does). I figured out all the tricks by about the halfway point, but I still had fun in the later chapters, even if part of that was laughing at its B-movie nature.\n\nDon't take this as a glowing endorsement, though. There are quite a few serious issues with the game. It is not very well-optimized, there are loading-induced stutters and frame drops GALORE, the times when the dialog kicks in are often nonsensical (and hilariously immersion-breaking), the story is opaque from a mile away, you rinse-repeat the same exact actions in all 5 areas, and the game is too easy (although they would have had to be smart about making it more difficult).\n\nThe reason for my last parenthetical is that, should you die, you "awaken" back at the entrance to your current area with none of the remnants you picked up, and you have to do the ENTIRE section over again. It would have been MUCH smarter if they instituted a manual save game feature like so many other horror games. Case in point, I had to attempt the 3rd area 3 times, and I was so annoyed by the 3rd try that I was beyond scaring.\n\nThe game does a few things pretty well too, though. While there are copious amounts of blur, dust, and focus issues preventing you from seeing them, the graphics are actually quite pretty. This is the first game to use the Unreal Engine 4, and if you look closely enough, you can see the subtle upgrades over UE3. Also, the menu theme is interesting, if not entirely memorable. I've tried to think of a 3rd good thing to say, but I can't.\n\nI can't say this was my favorite horror game of all time, or even in the top 5 (maybe even 10), but if you're a horror fan and you understand it for what it is, you should get a decent amount of fun out of it.\n\nDO NOT pay $15 for it though. The entire thing is about 2 hours long, even with having to replay some areas.","May 2, 2014","true","2.1"," 10 of 22 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","10","22","0","3"

This game is utter CRAP, from early the game uses MUCH more cpu and memory that is minimum or recomended, far more in fact, to be straight with you, watch dogs runs better in my computer than this game, this can be caused by a numerous things but the main reason is the poorly optimization this game have, the anwful work design and the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• idea of using the unreal engine 4, i mean this game is just a benchmark for the UE4, and fails at it because i meet the minimun requirements and i almost have the recomended to play and still after like 10 minutes of play (the game loads while you're playing, so you have to stand in front of a door waiting the game to load the next part) and it hangs completly, while you still hear the music, this game sucks in every posible way and it's trully the work of useless programers trying to make a quick buck, don't buyt it even if is on sale, even free it's a bad choice.\n\nMetascore: 1/100 "If you look for the world ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• (s-hit) on the diccionary, you'll see "Daylight")","September 22, 2014","false","2.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

What this game has taught me is a far greater lesson.  The lesson is that I don't care for survival horror.\n\nIt's not that I get freaked out by video games from time to time.  A jump scare is fun sometimes.  It's not that this is necessarily a bad game.  It could be very good in its genre.  But outside of Code Veronica, this game has galvanized that I do not enjoy the genre.  I don't get scared by the monster chasing me in the hall.  I don't get scared by the popup ghosts.  I just don't get scared.  I get curious, I work through the motions of investigating or leaving, but that's about it.  The genre becomes less of a game and more of a chore.   I'm the one that's broken, but this game has showed me it's me.\n\nAs for the game itself, I can't give it a negative review.  It has a good atmosphere that it's aiming for.  There's plenty of backstory to fill in with all those papers left around.  Graphically and audibly it was pleasing.  Possibly I could appreciate it further in VR or 3D (this game seems to heavily support those kinds of options).  As it stands, it seems to have direction and only climbing the boxes felt truly tedious.\n\nThe fact that the levels are supposed to be procedurally generated by some degree should lend some replayability to this game.\n\nBut, I've found this isn't my genre so you may want to shop around other reviews.","May 8, 2014","true","0.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

A lot of the setting is cool looking, but the bad guys are all the same and repetitive. Sometimes the horror movie style creep moments are cool, but really not a lot of substance. The 'story' felt like it was going somewhere important, but was ultimately pointless.\n\nAlso, when I bought the game it wasn't made obvious that the Oculus support was DK1 only... which upset a lot of people. They've never added DK2 support, and I'm pretty sure the company is now dead...","May 19, 2015","false","1.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

And just a video game masterpiece in general.\n\nThe main number one reason why I say this is because Daylight is a procedurally generated video game which means that things are different each time you play. Procedurally generated video games are a work of absolute genius.\n\nBecause what this means for Daylight is tons of re-play value.\n\nI personally don't re-play the majority of games that I have. I'll play through most of my games once and then move on to something else, especially the ones that are heavily scripted. I find scripted video games to be the worst. Because after you learn the patterns of a scripted video game, it gets boring after a while because you know exactly what is going to happen.\n\nFor example the original un-modded version of Doom 3 which is heavily scripted. You know that no matter what, no matter how many times you play through the game, this monster is going to show up at this exact same location, that monster is going to show up at that same exact location once you reach the certain areas to trigger them to spawn.\n\nDaylight is a whole different story. With each play through, things are different. The notes are in different locations. The sound effects are different. The monsters spawn at different times and different locations. The layout of the map is different. The glow sticks and flares are in different locations. All of this is just absolutely incredible. This keeps Daylight fresh and new at all times. Plus it makes the game even more scary because you never know exactly what's going to happen next because the monsters spawn at random with each playthrough.\n\nAdd top notch scary sound effects to all of that and Daylight is an absolute horror masterpiece.\n\nIt's important to note that I haven't yet completed the game yet. So this is just my early first impression of the game. And it's definitely on the right track.","May 10, 2014","true","17.8"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

As your proceed you start to find about where you are, what happened there and why you are there. The gameplay is rather simple. You slowly explore areas and use glowsticks which help reveal items of interest around you (which is usefull as every playthrough is randomly generated), flares which 'burn' 'monsters' and your phone which acts as a map and light source. The game provides for a tense and creepy experience, although those looking for jump scares will be left dissapointed as the game has little in the way of such moments which I myself did not miss at all.\n\nThe largest potential issues I fell many may have is the games length, lack of inovation in terms of the horror and how easy it can become to get temporarioly lost largely as a result of its randamoly generated levels (note the levels are randomly generated, the objectives are not). Personally I like it when I get lost in a game especially when I am given the tools to not be lost (eg: thge map). Likewise it took myself three hours to finish though many have reported finishing the game in under an hour though replayability thanks to the levels always bieng different will be higher then in most similar games. Daylight however doesn't bring anything new to the horror game genre and whilst enjoyable will leave those expeccting new and/or unique mechanics dissapointed.","May 1, 2014","true","4.9"," 3 of 14 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","3","14","0","0"

This game‚Äôs main downside is that it suffered an increasingly popular gameplay mechanic that indie developers (mostly) utilize in budget ($15-$20 on Steam) horror games ‚Äì that of the random and/or pointless ‚Äòfetch‚Äô quest.  In Daylight‚Äôs case this takes the form of finding scraps of paper with a glowing sigil on them.\n\nOnce you find enough, some key-like item can then be collected from a magically-bound room that you in turn must use on a magically barred room/passage to proceed on to the next location, etc. Of course you have to backtrack to find said ‚Äòbarred‚Äô room/passage which can be a real pain in the a$$ considering that you can‚Äôt use a flare at that point to ward off the witches (the ghosts that appear in the game) and the map on the phone your character continually holds out (light is always on at least) in her right hand isn‚Äôt very helpful.  One other factor some will have an issue with is length - Daylight will only take most peeps on Steam about 1.5 ‚Äì 2 hrs to complete.\n\nGranted, that is a pretty short length for a game, but when considering that the basis of this game is the proverbial ‚Äòfetch‚Äô quest, that doesn‚Äôt seem so bad in retrospect (seriously, would anyone want to endure a game that is 10+ hrs, or perhaps far longer, when that was the sole basis of said game? I think not!). There are trading cards, achievements and controller support as well, so that makes playing more enjoying and the achievements at least add some replay value if that‚Äôs your thing.\n\nNot a bad game to finish on per se (the developers closed up shop after 20+ yrs recently so hopefully you won‚Äôt suffer a bug that prevents you from playing this game properly, if at all, as you just may be SOL at that point) and with the drop from $15 to $10 it definitely wouldn‚Äôt hurt to look into grabbing a copy for yourself.","January 15, 2015","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I really could have liked it, if it hadn‚Äôt been for the severe graphics flaws. Daylight has wasted enough of my time, so I won‚Äôt bother going into the things you might like about the game, which for me, is a big deal as I try to keep an open mind and look for the positives in every game.\n\nDaylight‚Äôs most severe issue is its heavy requirements to even play. You‚Äôve got a system check to make sure your computer can even handle loading the game much less play it in a comfortable fashion. Now, before I get hate-spam, yes, my computer got all passes on this checklist and all of my drivers are up to date. Still, playing this game with EVERY SINGLE SETTING AS LOW AS IT CAN POSSIBLY GO was almost impossible. I say almost because I have, in fact, beaten it multiple times, but it was a miserable experience and not worth the stress just to get the achievements. Even with the settings as low as possible, the game was choppy, the screen froze, I fell through the world twice in the forest, I had the game completely crash and close without warning, and on at least one occasion I had to reboot my computer to get out of the lock-up. I realized these problems, specifically the screen freezing, happened every single time I tried to use a flare. I would light the flare, and immediately it would freeze. I could hear the flare hissing away, I could even hear myself scream and hear the dying-notice pop up, but I would still be looking at a screen of hand half-raised with newly lit flare, and be unable to move. I ran four playthroughs of this game, and each time I spent the ENTIRE game staring at the floor and relying on the mini-map to move.\n\nAnother graphics issue is that at the end there are several cut-scenes, and I had no idea what these were supposed to be. It turns out, that is because my screen was ONLY showing a zoomed-in top-left hand corner of the whole picture before fading to blinding white and ending. I still have no idea what the real ending is supposed to look like. And I never will.\n\nThat being said, whether it‚Äôs a graphics issue or an AI issue, multiple times I would have a lit flare up and a witch would come out and kill me, and be completely unaffected by the flare (which is supposed to burn them away and defend you). This happened like clockwork in the prison level hard mode every single time I reached 6/8 remnants and attempted to look for numbers 7 & 8, six times in a row before I finally lucked out. That was the last of my runs. I have not gathered all the achievements on this game. For those that know me, this screams as to the quality of this game as I am an achievement addict and a masochist and will continue to play a game long after I‚Äôve lost interest in it JUST to complete the achievements.\n\nAll in all, I do not recommend Daylight. For the price they charge, four short chapters worth of content, and all the graphics nightmares of a rushed EA title, I‚Äôd recommend ordering some delivery and catching up on your favorite tv shows instead. You will have a much better time.","May 31, 2014","false","32.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Keboh/recommended/230840/","Keboh","Keboh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Keboh/","134 products in account","First, let me start off by saying this is my first survival horror game, so this review is meant more as a supplement to other more seasoned reviews as opposed to a standalone. Also my playtime on record was mostly "sitting time". I've spent maybe about 2-3 hours playing the game, and I'm maybe half way through. Most people say they beat it in 2 hours or less, but I try to take my time on games and find everything.\n\nI enjoy the genre of the game and am somewhat glad I got to expirience it because it opened me up to the genre. However it seems my first game in the genre was extremely lackluster compared to others which comes at a relief because this game is mediocre at best. I'm fortunate in the fact that I got this game for free with my graphics card I purchased.\n\nThe sound is the best quality of the game, with random noises in the background you would expect from these games, screams, stomping, whatever that sound is the witches make as they chase you, etc. The music is good and adds suspense, I enjoy the little piano title song. Everything else in this game is below expectations. I'm most disapointed in the graphics. I expected better from the new unreal engine, however it looks like something that would have come out a few years ago. One reviewer described it as "looking like a student project" which is exactly what I thought as I walked through the randomly generated mazes.\n\nYou play as a girl named Sarah in which you really know nothing about, and so far in my playthrough no character development has been attempted. Using a cellphone as a map/flashlight to light your way around the mazes of a hospital, sewer, prison, and forest you search for remnants in the form of notes to peopel at the aforementioned areas that try to add some backstory to the areas you wander. Another reviewer described the narrative as "fan fiction grade" which I couldn't agree more. In the last one I found there was even a word missing which really urked me. After you find all the remnants in an area you can then find the key to use on a "magical door", as another reviewer described it, to access the next area. While searching for said remnants and the key "witches" will appear around corners or behind you with a shrieking noise and then give chase unless you utilize a flare. They were kind of fun at first, but now they are appearing too often and it has just become an annoyance. I had to take a break from the game because everytime I'd walk into a certain room a witch would appear and chase me out making me lose the progress I had made in the maze. Everytime I tried to get back to the room another witch would appear either in the room or in the hallway as I was making my way back to the room and chase me again. It happened at least five times in a row, and I became very aggravated. Sarah walks at a pretty slow pace which requires some patience. I go through the game running pretty much everywhere I go. However, while running the game tries to imitate some of the newer horror movies which are made as if they're home videos in the sense that the camera moves around a lot while the person filming moves. I.E. The Blair Witch Project. Lastly, the game utilizes an autosave function with no way to manually save. There's no quitting whenever you want, so hopefully you don't get too frightened or aggravated in between saves.\n\nAt the end of the day I would give this game a 5/10 and I can not recommend anyone pay $15 for it. As stated before I got it for free. At most I would pay $5 for this game. If you're looking for a new survival horror game, have played all the other big titles, and this game is on sale go ahead and give it a try. The game is scary but as most others have said there are better games in the genre.\n\nMy quotes throughout the review were from reviewer "[AReV]BavarianGod". You can find his review on this page, as well as his video review.","June 1, 2014","false","17.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have a "Let's Play" of the game that pretty much sums up with my experience with it but for lack of desire to post that with my video I will just post what I tried to say.\n\nThe game has its flaw, it's very short, very linear, and terrifying when it tries to be. I beat the game in two sittings spanning about an hour and a half total and was initially WOW'd by the quality but that quickly wore off when the legitimate fright turned into "Oh... Jumpscare... Haven't seen that before..." due to the sheer lack of truly horrifying moments save for a few. I found one instance where I was on the edge of my seat but less than five minutes later I got bored and the game never really picked up.\n\nThat being said, the game has a brilliant, albeit unoriginal, atmosphere with a decent story to back it up. The game is randomly generated in its environment so every time you play the game you'll have a slightly different experience. Also, the (SPOILER) Ghostie (END SPOILER) is terrifying and silent until you spot it.\n\nI feel that while the game can be scary, it doesn't make up for the lack of constant threat.

For example the random closing of doors had me spooked at first, wondering what I was going to see when I opened it... Nothing ever appeared. Things get knocked over or gently pushed across the floor, but they're completely unconnected actions; it's not to lure you in a particular direction or deter you, it‚Äôs just a random event that the developers thought would be spooky. Any fear I experienced came from my own expectations of what a horror game would involve.\n\nThe game boasts procedural content; however on the two occasions that I died (once because a ghost spawned right next to me, the other because I fell into water and couldn‚Äôt find a way out, exciting ways to go) I didn‚Äôt see much to support this. The layout of the area seemed to stay exactly the same, only the letters that you‚Äôre tasked with finding seemed to move. If there is more to it I certainly didn‚Äôt see it, and if you‚Äôre going to claim that each playthrough is going to be different, the game either needs to be good enough to warrant that second time or offer some incentive to. The game fulfils neither of those. The rooms and corridors are generally devoid of content and all look practically the same for a given level, to the extent where it feels like there are two sets of corridors and two room types. Procedural content is pointless if you only experience it once.\n\nThere's a few different areas to experience, with you being blocked off from the previous one each time you progress, so while there are no loading screens after the initial one, these serve as obvious barriers to save them having to keep too much geometry in memory. That may sound like trying to delve too much under the hood, but the knock on effect of the game play is that the game areas feel incredibly small, and not confined in the ‚Äúgood‚Äù claustrophobic way you'd want from a horror game.\n\nGlowsticks are provided that highlight objects you can interact with when used; however not only is it not really necessary, it‚Äôs usually pretty obvious what you can click on, but it bathes the world in a garish shade of green. The only weapon you have against the shadows is a flare (no idea why), but it takes so long for the lighting animation to finish that if they‚Äôre close you may as well just run. Also, as per the silent hill radio, if a shadow is nearby the phone screen flickers, meaning; the moment you notice that, light a flare and spin around, since all shadows are killed instantly by it there is no danger at all in the game. The game provides a ‚Äúthreat‚Äù meter on screen, which gradually fills up as you find remnants, which I assume is supposed to be tied to shadow spawn frequency, however I've had shadows constantly spawning every few seconds with only a sliver of the threat meter filled in.\n\nAs such the game becomes a tedious chore of looking around the current environment for letters that are marked with a red seal, though the game doesn‚Äôt provide any context as to why these letters are littered around. Finding all the ones in the level spawns a sigil in the maze room, no indication as to why there are maze rooms in each level, which you then take to some aura‚Ä¶ thing, which blocks the exit to open up the next level. Again, no explanation as to what the mysterious power that blocks your way is.\n\nSomething that really brought me out of the experience was Sarah's insistence on calling out "is someone there?" and the like, while I'm trying everything in my power to remain inconspicuous. While I understand it sells that Sarah is her own character and is affected by the situation, everytime I'd assume it was provoked by something and start spinning round trying to work out what it was, unfortunately there never seemed to be any specific trigger, which got really tiresome after the first few times. The other use of audio isn‚Äôt particularly noteworthy, you‚Äôll hear the assortment of effects you‚Äôd expect from a horror game, but they never appeared to be tied to anything in game.\n\nIt took around two hours to finish the game, which, considering how little fun it is to play, may be some small solace, but even at the reduced preorder price I paid, I felt ripped off. Regardless of how long it took to beat though, the gameplay is essentially 15 minutes long; once you've been through the first environment you‚Äôve essentially experienced all you‚Äôre going to with the game. The ‚Äúpuzzles‚Äù (if you get stumped moving a box into position or finding a switch to flip you can remove the quotes) are completely unnecessary and offer nothing to distract you from the tedium at hand.\n\nThe story itself is competent enough, and put into a more tailored experience where the environments you go through actually mean something rather than being a conduit for letters, it‚Äôd be fine. It really is a shame that the gimmick of the game is what ultimately fails it. I‚Äôm not going to say the game is absent of horror, I‚Äôve been to plenty of movies where the rest of the audience has been in shock and disbelief at something I‚Äôve shrugged at, but for me, Daylight was one of the mildest horror experiences I‚Äôve had in a long time.","May 13, 2014","false","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I would like to first brign up that I beat the game and got most of the collectibles on normal in about two hours. From what I payed thats around $5 an hour and I got it on sale. The game has you doing the same ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• the whole time too, it's always find 6 letters and then you can finally grab the key that opens the door into the next area. The one saving grace to this game are the collectibles (not the stupid pictures) mainly the letters that do an alright job at fleshing out the creepy lore. Besides that everything kind of fall flat. The games main areas are "procedurally generated" which basicly mean you can expect the same ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing hallways and rooms copy and pasted around the place. There is only one single enemy in the game (why they could have done so much with variety) that really only teleports behind you and makes loud noises. The enemy is really just boring after a few minutes beause it gives up on chasing you really fast and can be out run easily. It doesn't help that all the scares are cheap jump scares. The rooms lose any automsphere when you've been seeing them all over the place. Also the use of glow sticks and flares should have been toned down or not been in here at all. Glow sticks highlight points of intrest like desks,cupboards etc( only select few can be searched ). Flares on the other hand instantly get rid of "shadows" chasing you although throwing lit flares down seems to just have a visual effect, so the enemy vanishes when your holding it but if it's just on the floor lit, it doesn't even notice it...  I KNOW STUPID RIGHT!   Also I don't know why they thought it was a good idea to have abandoned pouches with glowsticks all over the island but whatever guess there must have been a few raves. Unlike for example Slender I don't see much replay value, sure the hallways may be arranged differently but the enemy chasing you isn't nearly as fun. Overall this game had a lot of potential... but ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ed up.

I beat it in one sitting in the span of about 80-ish minutes. I can't exactly say it was what I expected, but I don't exactly know what I expected.\n\nFirst off, the game is quiet repetitive. Each area of the game requires you to collect about six "Remnants" which if you've played Slender you can just call "Pages" Once you've gotten all of the Remnants you then must go find a "Sigil" which is a haunted item that unlocks the next area. Each area begins with a small transition stage where a lot of story related notes are. This formula persists throughout the entire game and can get dull after a while.\n\nThe game's backstory is told mostly by notes and the Remnants you collect around the level, it isn't too much. Mainly just exposition about the hospital, what happened there, and how it was shut down. While the main storyline in the game is almost invisible. The game doesn't tell you why you're there and the only reason I know why is from a developer interview with TotalBiscuit where it was mentioned. But other than that you pretty much walk through the hospital and listen to the voices of two people. Yourself, who's only comments usually consists of "Is someone in there?" Or "Oh god! Make it stop!", and the... Other person, who talks to the main character (Sarah) throughout her quest. I don't believe the game ever tells you who he is or how the hell he's talking to you in the first place. I'm assuming it's through the phone but I'm not sure. The ending is... Okay. Don't expect it to wow you in any way and expect to get a little whiplash from it's sudden climax. It felt like they were rushing to clear things up, explain it all, and end the game right then and there.\n\nThe horror aspect isn't anything special, but it's well done. I jumped out of my seat quite a few times upon encountering the ghost. Named "Shadows" by the game. You're only way to fight them off are using the flares, which don't look as good in-game as they did in the demos with the incredibly violent, dark shadows. In the actual game their shadows aren't as defined and it's pretty much just a brighter glowstick that burns ghosts. The glowsticks act as the game's "Help me" button. Using a glowstick reveals key items such as containers that might contain items and key items. (Mainly containers though.) As well as providing a decent amount of light. The ghosts are scary enough, but there is something I wanted to mention down below.\n\nOkay, so this game is VERY inconstant with some of it's gameplay demos before release, mainly in the aspect of the enemy's appearance. Some show them as a floating green monster with a big gaping mouth and long limbs, but in reality the game's enemy is... Well, there isn't really much to spoil. If you've seen a creepy ghost lady in a horror movie, then you've seen the Daylight monster. It's rather unoriginal. It looks cool, don't get me wrong, but it's unoriginal. While the green monster didn't look too scary, if they gave it a better design it would have been really cool to see. As I also mentioned before, the flare's don't look like they advertised in some gameplay demos, casting large, jagged dynamic shadows across the area? No, not really. It just creates a large, bright red glow. I wouldn't label it as false advertising, as later trailers showed the scary woman ghost. It's just confusing.\n\nMy rating of Daylight would be about in the 6/10 for you people who like that sort of rating. It's a fun game to play while it lasts, and the procedural generation gives it some replay value, but it's rather slow and repetitive with a story which isn't too interesting. Collectibles may be another reason to replay it, however for some reason you can't reread collected notes unless they were Remnants. It's got it's scary moments, and for the price it isn't too bad. I happened to get it for free from a giveaway from a Youtube channel. InstinctiveHDGaming. Go check him out, he's pretty interesting.\nBut enough advertisements, I'm going to go and see if I can rack up enough money for the new Outlast DLC, hopefully that can satisfy my horror cravings.","April 29, 2014","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Where as the story was a little confusing, the gameplay was smooth and controls are very simple. 1 for glowsticks, 2 for flares, and M for map, thats just about all you need to know. the game didn't have much jumpscares for me, mainly because i was on the easy difficulty, so i would recommend being on medium or hard diffuculty for a more "Challenging" more "Frightening" expirence. it is a little overpriced for a short game, i beat it in one day (i know, i have no life) its a good 6 to 7 hours of gameplay depending on your pace (as scary as it is, it gets pretty fast-paced). as it is a good game, nearing the end, the game got a little old kinda fast. on each level you do the same thing as you did the previous level, i wont ruin much but you find remnants while staying away from ghosts. as for the graphics, they're pretty good. if you've ever played Blacklight: Retribution (which you should) it has just about the same detail in graphics as Daylight (Mainly because Daylight was made by the same people that made Blacklight (no pun intended)) me personally, i dont play much horror games, or finish them, but this game is definentally a must for people who like horror games. but overall, i would give it an 8/10 mainly it gets a little old kinda fast nearing the end of the game. but seriously BUY THIS GAME :D","April 29, 2014","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm going to keep this short and simple.\nThe game starts off somewhat slow, but soon enough you are thrown into what the game is all about... suspense. Unfortunately, it doesn't last long. After about a half hour of gameplay, I'd seen everything the game had to offer... which is not much, I completed my first playthrough in two hours. None of the achievements appear to be working correctly for this game, as the ones I unlocked all popped up, but only one of them appears to have saved.\n\nIt was a great, if not short, timewaster, however it's not worth it's $15 pricetag. The way I figure it is, for two hours, it's more or less the cost of a movie, the often-compared to entertainment alternative to gaming. Time dependent, it lasts about as long as some movies, too. However, as stated above, after a half hour, I had seen everything the game had to offer, which, effectively aakes a half-decent movie a better buy.\nThe climax and conclusion of the last "act" of the game, seemigly suppossed to be the most suspenseful, ended up being the least suspenseful part of the game. I'll avoid spoilers here... but suffice to say, it was completed by just continually sprinting around. You'll understand how effective it is, should you endure through the game to get there yourself.\n\nWhile this game is procedurally generated, and even upon death, the map changes... it offers very limited replayability. All the scripted jump scares happen in all the same places, and you come to expect them.\n\nOn the onset of my second playthrough, it also appears to be the same storyline.","April 29, 2014","false","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Try to get it for less than 10$ if you can.\n\nThe bad.\n\nPersistant choppy lag that didn't go away even after I lowered the graphics setting to damn near mid 2000s era quality. This hindered me greatly and caused me no end of doom and frustration, Others are having the same issues as well I may add, this problem MUST be fixed as it is causing some poor souls' games to crash in bad cases.\n\nRecycled enviroments that while randomly generated just don't fit together properly. One second I was in an insane asylum then a morgue then a prison cell block then back to an asylum. They could fix this by having certain areas only spawn around other areas that match them, Then we wouldn't have the confusing unrealistic layouts and everything would flow together seamlessly and make this feel like a true full on retail game.\n\nJump scares abound. Hey, This crap has been done to death if you like it more power to you but most people are tired of this recycled predictable scare tactic. "Penumbra 1-2&3, amnesia 1&2,Outlast, and a whole slew of other games not to mention a few more that are STILL being developed all have already done it." (PS buy penumbra and amnesia if you haven't already. Totally worth it.) and while the ambiance IS creepy the jumpscare to ambiance ratio is a bit uneven leading to you just being annoyed by damn ghosts trying to kill you constantly.\n\nShadows that chase you endlessly. It is KINDA difficult to get ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• done and find all the clues you need to get through the game when the same freaking ghost appears every single time your freaking flare goes out causing you to lose health or die almost instantly. It makes exploring and finding what you MUST have to progress through the game nearly impossible and makes you not want to play it again. This must be fixed as well, I actually had to quit my game because I couldn't advance.\n\nRepetitive linear gameplay dispite the randomly generated maps. Do NOT let their talk of randomly generated maps fool you into think that this game will constantly be a new adventure, You will STILL be hunting for the SAME objects in the SAME areas and the only thing that will be different is the layout. Nothing else changes and you still have to find 6 objects to make an object appear that allows you to proceed to the next area where you do the same exact thing. It is the very definition of Tedious.\n\nIN CONCLUSION.\n\nThe game would function PERFECTLY if it were not for the lag as that was the only technical issue I personally have had and it seems to be the big issue with the game itself as many others have the same problem. While pretty to look at the quality of the graphics don't mean anything if the game is so full of lag that everything is constantly fading in and out of focus or glitching out! The game flow is obstructed by random out of place enviroments that just don't fit in which makes the game feel unrealistic which can make it hard to put yourself into the game if you are a fan of attention to detail. There are too many jump scares and not enough buildup to get to those scares which makes most of them in turn, cheap, repetitive, and predictable.\n\nThe game at it's core is tedious at best and a never ending array of poorly placed areas won't change that and if the developers thought it would distract people from their lazy game design they are dead wrong. As you play this game you will notice that it is nothing more than a mere knockoff of other better indie games, This one will not be worth your time until it is patched and hopefully updated and offered at a reduced price. get it for less than 9$ if you can as it may not even work at all for you. I give this game an A for effort but a D for execution, With a little more polishing this game will be a buyable and enjoyable game but until then I say steer clear and force the developers to put a little more effort into the game to encourage others to buy it. I give it a 2.5 out of 5.","April 29, 2014","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The debut at E3 was me enticed! But since then I had been playing a recent horror game titled Outlast. Compared to Outlast this game blows...\n\nMy Dislikes about this game:\n1) REPITITION!!!! It seemed like I was stuck in the same hallway for what felt like forever. And once you "die" you have to repeat the same $h!T over... was unamused.\n2) Poorly implemented! The game had caused my PC to crash, blue screen and everything! Was extremely upsetting. However, I did just install a recent Windows 8.1 update, so it could have been that...thanks Microsoft!\n3) It just wasn't scary... I felt a little freaked out, heart was pumping a teeny bit faster, but compared to other scary games... I would have rather had more cheesy jumpscares!\n4) For a final release (past BETA), $10 is seriously overpriced for this game.\n5) After reading that this had used the Unreal Engine 4, this is such a disappointment...\n6) LACK OF INSTRUCTION! Like I didn't know I needed to actually collect "Relics" before proceeding to the next area. Some objectives would have helped!\n7) The monster wasn't even that scary, just got extremely annoying! I would've rather had her jumping around or something, not float and scream\n8) A hint that I couldn't use flares while holding the object to unlock the doors would have been EXTREMELY HELPFUL\n9) ... that I am writing such a long review...\n\nMy likes about this game:\n1) It got a little creepy... Reading that flares would help protect me and hearing footsteps at the same time got my finger pressing '2'!\n2) The setting for the game was interesting, haunted hospitals are always interesting...\n3) The sound was great, sqeaky doors  and footsteps were good.\n\nOverall OPINION:\nThe game was honestly a great idea, I could see what the devs were trying to go for.\nBut all their ideas were poorly implemented. I only spent an hour before I gave up on the game, although an hour was all it took for my PC to crash and be needed to reset to factory standards...\nI hope this game gets a major update or something that will make this title much better.

A mysterious voice tells her to find the secrets of the hospital. With a cell phone, which is her map, she must explore the haunted hospital and its criminal past in order to escape. As she explores the hospital and the adjacent prison, Sarah begins to learn of the hospital's past, where twelve witches were executed and buried on the hospital grounds, with a thirteenth witch escaping death due to her turning in the other twelve witches. Sarah also discovers that she is a descendant of the thirteenth witch, and that the angry spirits of the twelve slain witches seek vengeance on her. However, it is unclear whether Sarah manages to escape the hospital or not find out yourself.\n\nthe player does not have access to weapons; the only tools available are glow sticks, flares, and a cell phone. The game's environment and layout are randomly generated for each gameplay, resulting in the very first maze game to use Unreal Engine 4. In addition, the enemies and other antagonists are procedurally spawned.\n\nThe player's goal in each level is to search for notes and logs from the hospital's past, referred to as "remnants", by looking for markings using glow sticks. Discovering remnants can cause a marking on her arm, which attracts the dangerous "shadow people". The player can either make them disappear by using flares or lose them by running away. Once all remnants in a level have been collected, the player is able to acquire a "sigil", an item of significance to the hospital's past, such as a teddy bear and a Bible. Bringing the sigil to "the Seal of Shadows" will unlock the next part of the building, allowing the player to advance further into the hospital and, possibly, to freedom.\n\nDaylight is a survival horror video game.

It leaves a somwehat interesting aftertaste, but the playing itself is rather boring. It feels like a very early alpha of some indie game.\nGenerated levels is an idea that sounds cool, but in the actual game those generated mazes look dull, repetitive and awfully cluttered. If the devs were braver and added more glitchiness and weirness (think Memory of Broken Dimension) maybe it woul've been more interesting. But they chose to just throw a heap of horror game cliches in a weak attempt to follow Outlast footsteps. Unsuccessfully.

One thing i will say is dont buy it!!\nfirstly its only 2 to 3 hours long making it the shortest game iv ever played in my life!\nThe storey isnt much good ether and leaves alot of things unexplained.\nThere were a few good points to be fair. The game is really scairy and made me jump alot.\nThe game looks and sounds great too. There are lots of random sounds, screams,footsteps,bangs and bumps keeping you thinking is that something thats going to jump out and slice my face off or am i safe.\nThe downside though is most of the game looks the same all the time. Every hall every door every room there all the same just repeated over and over again and it just starts to feel lazy and a little dull.\nThe first hour or so of the game leaves you not really knowing if you have gone anywere at all as it still looks the same as when you started out.\nThis game could have been great but its falls so short of even been average. The people that made this really didnt try to do anything with it at all! other than test out the new unreal 4 engine.\n1 out of 10 at best.","May 1, 2014","false","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm recommending it, but only during a Steam sale.\n\nOn the one hand, there were segments where I genuinely felt scared as I was traversing the level. As you get further through the game, the enemies become more plentiful and harder to fend off with your flares. It felt like I got to a point where a new ghost would spawn every 10 feet and I'd have to activate my last flare to kill it or i'd just have to run away. This always kept me on edge and hoping i'd get another flare soon.\n\nOn the negative side of things, I don't think this game does Unreal Engine 4 justice. Everything from the textures to some of the lighting just looks very mediocre. Instead of the in-game objects looking sharp and clear on max settings, they seem to just look fuzzy. I don't know if they just directly ported the PS4 version of the game with minimal changes or what.\n\nThe other thing is the player character's commentary about the area around you. Alot of it seemed out of place and even annoying at times. I understood the context that Sarah, protagonist, is scared of everything around her, but asking "Is somebody there?" when it's obvious that no one is broke the immersion for me. That said, in the later levels, I felt her commentary was much more appropriate.\n\nWatch some gameplay on youtube before you decide to buy.

After playing this for even less than an hour, I was kind of bored.  I had a couple scares, but they were two scares in almost one moment.  For the most part you just wander around, picking up papers that give a little bit of information on what has gone on in the hospital and then proceed by finding a special object and opening some portal to the next area.  Meanwhile you are followed and watched by some ghost.  You hear screams, footsteps that may be your own, weird sounds, and even a ghost once in a while.  The ghosts aren't even that scary most of the time.  I don't scare easy playing these like the ones on YouTube, but I think some of that is an act anyway, most reactions aren't, but again, I don't react to the scares as much as many do.\n\nThis game is tedious, repetative, hardly scary, same old ghost stories you always hear, and nothing seems to kill you.

I beat it in one sitting in the span of about 80-ish minutes. I can't exactly say it was what I expected, but I don't exactly know what I expected.\n\nFirst off, the game is quiet repetitive. Each area of the game requires you to collect about six "Remnants" which if you've played Slender you can just call "Pages" Once you've gotten all of the Remnants you then must go find a "Sigil" which is a haunted item that unlocks the next area. Each area begins with a small transition stage where a lot of story related notes are. This formula persists throughout the entire game and can get dull after a while.\n\nThe game's backstory is told mostly by notes and the Remnants you collect around the level, it isn't too much. Mainly just exposition about the hospital, what happened there, and how it was shut down. While the main storyline in the game is almost invisible. The game doesn't tell you why you're there and the only reason I know why is from a developer interview with TotalBiscuit where it was mentioned. But other than that you pretty much walk through the hospital and listen to the voices of two people. Yourself, who's only comments usually consists of "Is someone in there?" Or "Oh god! Make it stop!", and the... Other person, who talks to the main character (Sarah) throughout her quest. I don't believe the game ever tells you who he is or how the hell he's talking to you in the first place. I'm assuming it's through the phone but I'm not sure. The ending is... Okay. Don't expect it to wow you in any way and expect to get a little whiplash from it's sudden climax. It felt like they were rushing to clear things up, explain it all, and end the game right then and there.\n\nThe horror aspect isn't anything special, but it's well done. I jumped out of my seat quite a few times upon encountering the ghost. Named "Shadows" by the game. You're only way to fight them off are using the flares, which don't look as good in-game as they did in the demos with the incredibly violent, dark shadows. In the actual game their shadows aren't as defined and it's pretty much just a brighter glowstick that burns ghosts. The glowsticks act as the game's "Help me" button. Using a glowstick reveals key items such as containers that might contain items and key items. (Mainly containers though.) As well as providing a decent amount of light. The ghosts are scary enough, but there is something I wanted to mention down below.\n\nOkay, so this game is VERY inconstant with some of it's gameplay demos before release, mainly in the aspect of the enemy's appearance. Some show them as a floating green monster with a big gaping mouth and long limbs, but in reality the game's enemy is... Well, there isn't really much to spoil. If you've seen a creepy ghost lady in a horror movie, then you've seen the Daylight monster. It's rather unoriginal. It looks cool, don't get me wrong, but it's unoriginal. While the green monster didn't look too scary, if they gave it a better design it would have been really cool to see. As I also mentioned before, the flare's don't look like they advertised in some gameplay demos, casting large, jagged dynamic shadows across the area? No, not really. It just creates a large, bright red glow. I wouldn't label it as false advertising, as later trailers showed the scary woman ghost. It's just confusing.\n\nMy rating of Daylight would be about in the 6/10 for you people who like that sort of rating. It's a fun game to play while it lasts, and the procedural generation gives it some replay value, but it's rather slow and repetitive with a story which isn't too interesting. Collectibles may be another reason to replay it, however for some reason you can't reread collected notes unless they were Remnants. It's got it's scary moments, and for the price it isn't too bad. I happened to get it for free from a giveaway from a Youtube channel. InstinctiveHDGaming. Go check him out, he's pretty interesting.\nBut enough advertisements, I'm going to go and see if I can rack up enough money for the new Outlast DLC, hopefully that can satisfy my horror cravings.","April 29, 2014","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Where as the story was a little confusing, the gameplay was smooth and controls are very simple. 1 for glowsticks, 2 for flares, and M for map, thats just about all you need to know. the game didn't have much jumpscares for me, mainly because i was on the easy difficulty, so i would recommend being on medium or hard diffuculty for a more "Challenging" more "Frightening" expirence. it is a little overpriced for a short game, i beat it in one day (i know, i have no life) its a good 6 to 7 hours of gameplay depending on your pace (as scary as it is, it gets pretty fast-paced). as it is a good game, nearing the end, the game got a little old kinda fast. on each level you do the same thing as you did the previous level, i wont ruin much but you find remnants while staying away from ghosts. as for the graphics, they're pretty good. if you've ever played Blacklight: Retribution (which you should) it has just about the same detail in graphics as Daylight (Mainly because Daylight was made by the same people that made Blacklight (no pun intended)) me personally, i dont play much horror games, or finish them, but this game is definentally a must for people who like horror games. but overall, i would give it an 8/10 mainly it gets a little old kinda fast nearing the end of the game. but seriously BUY THIS GAME :D","April 29, 2014","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm going to keep this short and simple.\nThe game starts off somewhat slow, but soon enough you are thrown into what the game is all about... suspense. Unfortunately, it doesn't last long. After about a half hour of gameplay, I'd seen everything the game had to offer... which is not much, I completed my first playthrough in two hours. None of the achievements appear to be working correctly for this game, as the ones I unlocked all popped up, but only one of them appears to have saved.\n\nIt was a great, if not short, timewaster, however it's not worth it's $15 pricetag. The way I figure it is, for two hours, it's more or less the cost of a movie, the often-compared to entertainment alternative to gaming. Time dependent, it lasts about as long as some movies, too. However, as stated above, after a half hour, I had seen everything the game had to offer, which, effectively aakes a half-decent movie a better buy.\nThe climax and conclusion of the last "act" of the game, seemigly suppossed to be the most suspenseful, ended up being the least suspenseful part of the game. I'll avoid spoilers here... but suffice to say, it was completed by just continually sprinting around. You'll understand how effective it is, should you endure through the game to get there yourself.\n\nWhile this game is procedurally generated, and even upon death, the map changes... it offers very limited replayability. All the scripted jump scares happen in all the same places, and you come to expect them.\n\nOn the onset of my second playthrough, it also appears to be the same storyline.","April 29, 2014","false","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have a "Let's Play" of the game that pretty much sums up with my experience with it but for lack of desire to post that with my video I will just post what I tried to say.\n\nThe game has its flaw, it's very short, very linear, and terrifying when it tries to be. I beat the game in two sittings spanning about an hour and a half total and was initially WOW'd by the quality but that quickly wore off when the legitimate fright turned into "Oh... Jumpscare... Haven't seen that before..." due to the sheer lack of truly horrifying moments save for a few. I found one instance where I was on the edge of my seat but less than five minutes later I got bored and the game never really picked up.\n\nThat being said, the game has a brilliant, albeit unoriginal, atmosphere with a decent story to back it up. The game is randomly generated in its environment so every time you play the game you'll have a slightly different experience. Also, the (SPOILER) Ghostie (END SPOILER) is terrifying and silent until you spot it.\n\nI feel that while the game can be scary, it doesn't make up for the lack of constant threat.

I'm recommending it, but only during a Steam sale.\n\nOn the one hand, there were segments where I genuinely felt scared as I was traversing the level. As you get further through the game, the enemies become more plentiful and harder to fend off with your flares. It felt like I got to a point where a new ghost would spawn every 10 feet and I'd have to activate my last flare to kill it or i'd just have to run away. This always kept me on edge and hoping i'd get another flare soon.\n\nOn the negative side of things, I don't think this game does Unreal Engine 4 justice. Everything from the textures to some of the lighting just looks very mediocre. Instead of the in-game objects looking sharp and clear on max settings, they seem to just look fuzzy. I don't know if they just directly ported the PS4 version of the game with minimal changes or what.\n\nThe other thing is the player character's commentary about the area around you. Alot of it seemed out of place and even annoying at times. I understood the context that Sarah, protagonist, is scared of everything around her, but asking "Is somebody there?" when it's obvious that no one is broke the immersion for me. That said, in the later levels, I felt her commentary was much more appropriate.\n\nWatch some gameplay on youtube before you decide to buy.

After playing this for even less than an hour, I was kind of bored.  I had a couple scares, but they were two scares in almost one moment.  For the most part you just wander around, picking up papers that give a little bit of information on what has gone on in the hospital and then proceed by finding a special object and opening some portal to the next area.  Meanwhile you are followed and watched by some ghost.  You hear screams, footsteps that may be your own, weird sounds, and even a ghost once in a while.  The ghosts aren't even that scary most of the time.  I don't scare easy playing these like the ones on YouTube, but I think some of that is an act anyway, most reactions aren't, but again, I don't react to the scares as much as many do.\n\nThis game is tedious, repetative, hardly scary, same old ghost stories you always hear, and nothing seems to kill you.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hrdkr/recommended/230840/","hrdkr","Hrdkr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hrdkr/","372 products in account","This game is short. So is my review. You can easily beat it in one seat.\n\nDaylight adds not too much to the horror/survival/run & hide genre. It is actually not obligatory run & hide, because you can repel your enemies with a flare, because a bright light fears these pesky shadow creations just like Mogwai fears Satan.\n\nThe remarkable things about Daylight are the following. It is the first game, built on top of the Unreal Engine 4. It is the most remarkable thing. The graphics however are not of any next-gen look. The physics too is not of any particular interest, so the Unreal Engine 4 is not really a big deal here.\n\nJust like the other games of its keen, I mean Penumbra, Amnesia and Outlast, it introduces a new source of light ‚Äî the smartphone with unlimited battery life. It easily lightens up any dark in the game, but you are encouraged to use two different and somewhat scarce light sources (worth to mention, these borrowed from Penumbra series) ‚Äî green glowsticks and bright red flares. Unlike Penumbra's counterparts, these two are not last enough, but glowsticks highlights key items, unveiling an intricate ‚Äòmazy' lines on top of it, and flares fears Satan... em, sorry, Shadows. Shadows are a ghostly witches, which are the Sarah's sole enemies in the game and in the most parts of Daylight there is just one Shadow to be aware of.\n\nThe gameplay is conforming to the next pattern. At first you enter a randomly generated maze, often it is the hospital's corridors and ruined rooms. In it you should collect some quantity of so called remnants (basically notes, explaining the game's events, just like in Penumbra, Amnesia and Outlast). After this is done, you go to some weird illuminated room, where you collect some floating object, like teddy bear. It is a key to the illuminated door in the different part of the maze.\n\nThe whole ‚Äòmazing‚Äô part is not really amazing, but you may get shiver or two, because the Shadow have a tendency to spawn somewhere near you with a frightening sound. But, as was previously said, you should not necessary run away from the creep, just light up the flare and it will disappear for a while.\n\nAfter the maze part here comes a narrative part, where you just proceed through the location, occasionally grabbing some not necessary to be collected remnants (these marked with a blue lights apart of necessary red). Then the maze part again. Repeat it four or five times and you will find yourself finished the game.\n\n'This is all?‚Äô you may have ask yourself, starring to the final credit titles. Yes, it actually is, and there are even no hints to the possible sequel. That's it. That's Daylight.\n\nImportant question may come to your head, when you reading this review ‚Äî is Daylight any scary? Is it worth a time? The answer is yes, it is a somewhat scary. But not that scary, as Outlast, Amnesia and Penumbra. Because of flares. Flares adds a good amount of comfort to the overall feeling.\n\nWill I recommend this game? I am a bit hesitant on this and if there is a kind of abstain button here on Steam reviews page, then I will press it. The game is a worthwhile and not at the same time. But as there is no such thing, let it be 'Yes, I recommend'.","May 6, 2014","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Buyer beware that this game has intense shaky cam. Even when you stand still, the camera is bobbing up and down, left and right. There is no need for this. I feeling like I'm going to puke just staring at the screen for ten seconds. Shaky cam in this instance does not add immersion. In real life, when I stand still, my head does not bob up and down left and right.  This is a cheap gimmick that makes the game unplayable.

I cannot understand why the developers would think shaky cam adds to the "horror" element and immersion. Even if I didn't get nauseous, the shaky cam is so bad I can't even focus on the enviornment.

I personally had some issues getting this game to run but as with 99.999% of the problems out there it was MY FAULT.

Rooms moved randomly, item shifted into different places, frustrating as hell. Mostly I ended up finding my way out by accident. Graphics are a bit meh, so much more potential in the engine. Save points come at odd times and not when expected.

If you're a fan of the horror genre in general, be it movies, books or games then you'll probably be able to predict what happens next. This game unashamedly trots out all the horror tropes - almost by the book - for better or worse, and for veterans of the genre, this might make it seem a little tired.\n\nBut for some, the fact that it plays from the Horror Cliches 101 textbook can work in its favour. You will be deliciously on edge as you pass by that wheelchair, because you just know it's going to suddenly move its squeaky wheels in your direction. If I look through this window, is a ghastly face going to appear on the other side, looking back?\n\nIt's moments like these that make this game so intense and frightening at times, to say nothing of the supernatural denizens that reside in the asylum that you may or may not come face to face with.\n\nBut if you're expecting deep gameplay and open ended exploration you will be sorely disappointed. Although this game does what it promises - scares the crap out of you - there's nothing much else really to it. You wander around hunting for Remnants, in game lore items, while waiting for the next supernatural event to occur. And, well, that's pretty much all she wrote.\n\nIt becomes somewhat tedious after awhile trudging through the same recycled corridors. And let me tell you, there are a LOT of corridors. For a game that was hyped as much as it was for using the Unreal 4 engine, the graphics and textures look somewhat muddy and washed out, at least they did on my rig. They definitely have a previous-gen look about them. And this is baffling, considering the fairly hefty system requirements. Though the sound design is excellent, and perfectly complements what's going on onscreen.\n\nFor the price though, give it a shot if you're a fan of survival horror games or horror stuff in general - you'll enjoy it, at least for a while - for this game is best enjoyed in short chunks, rather than extended play sessions.\n\nIn summary, it's horror-by-the-numbers fare that will absolutely have you browning trou, but apart from the scares, there is little on offer here in the way of gameplay and with surprisingly meaty running requirements at odds with the ordinary graphics you'll want to be a survival horror fan to appreciate this. If you want something you can savour, and enjoy being scared then, for the price especially, you can't go wrong here.\n\nA slightly above average 6 out of 10.","April 30, 2014","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But... kind of boring. Wander through a huge labyrinth of hallways that all look the same trying to find 6 little notes. I feel like there are WAY too many hallways though. I only need 6 notes and it's kind of a pain to look through 50 hallways just to find 6 little notes (not that there should be more notes). This game is basically Slender, but with a cookie cutter environment that has almost no landmarks. Yeah, you have a map, but all it does is show you where you've been. So it can help you find things you've already found but nothing else. It'd be nice if it showed you doors that you haven't opened in a hallway you've already visited.\n\nThe little scares are pretty stupid too. "EHRMAGERD! A STACK OF BOXES FELL DOWN. SO SPOOKY!" Yeah. Decent voice acting. Protagonist gets really spooked over little scares apparently. *Bottles rattle and fall over* "AHHHHHH!"\n\nUltimately, its scary, but there's not really a point in playing this game. I constantly find myself just wandering around looking for one last note for 5-10 minutes (or until I run out of flares, evil-woman basically pops up every 10 seconds) thinking "whats the point?"\n\nAlso, long load times. 2-3 minutes. Loading animation plays for 3/4 of the loading, then the screen freezes for a minute or two. So I can never tell if the game is crashing/freezing or not.\n","August 24, 2014","false","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I got this game when I purchased my GTX 760, so I didn't pay actual money for this game, so if it sucked, then it wouldn't be the worst thing ever. First I must mention how barebones the option menu is. There is little to nothing to adjust there, and most of the things that you can adjust there arn't very well described at all. Now the graphics. This is a section which I don't entirely hate. I actually think that the visuals are really good, with some exelent lighting effects here and there, what I hate about them, is that even on my GTX 760, it chuggs from time to time. I think this might be due to some sort of autosave thing working like ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, but it's really abnoxious. The sound design isn't that bad either, and is probably the game's best strength about it. Now the story. I didn't complete the game entirely because the beforementioned preformance issues were too much for me to handle, but from what I played of it, the story, while not bad, wasn't good either. Now the enemy, oh boy. The enemies in this game follow you around sorta like slenderman, exept without the teleporting ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•t, so that's a plus I guess. But my big problem with them, is that you can just stash a bunch of flares, and run into the enemy when you rarely see them. And for the gameplay, you colect stuff and go to a certian area to escape, like slender :P\nThe only reason I'm not harsher on this game, is because I never spent actual money on it, and got it with my graphics card, but don't buy it, it's a turd among greater horror games.","May 23, 2015","false","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is my first review and, I hate to say this game isn't worth your time.  Here are my issues.\n\nI can forgive the graphics, but you become really frustrated and angry that the HUD on your smart phone doesn't really help you locate the notes, (like Slender) to make progress.  Here, you don't feel dread when you find the next note, simply feelings like: "It's about time! What the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•? Didn't I search in this room already? *sigh* She better not kill me..."\n\nLater check points are horrible. You'll grind your teeth because what works in the beggining with flares, will not work later. Sometimes the ghost will do a stealth kill on you, without you even seeing her. The red blur will affect your vision when you try running away, and it makes it frustrating, not scary, when you are trying to get away.\n\nThe ending...really?...REALLY?!?! I beat this at a buddies house, and we both looked at each other similar to when Miley Cyrus twerked it up.  It's fun to play horror games with a friend, but I had to see that he was as frustrated as I was. Too bad I didn't save him from buying this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drachenhexe/recommended/230840/","drachenhexe","Dragonwitch","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drachenhexe/","514 products in account","This game is an extreme disappointment.  Desipite using Unreal 4 to power it, it is a very generic, very empty, and very repetitive game.   The fact that you have to replay it several times just to get all the story info is a cheap "play extending" tactic used by weak developers.  I'm not sure I want to finish this game once, let alone play it several more times.\n\nLevels are random for the most part and there appears to be no kind of algorithm that keeps one particular piece from being used to often.  There will be  times where you will see the same room in a section more than once, often more than three times.\n\nThere is no combat, but there is danger that ends your game.  This can be frustrationg because the supposed way to beat the typical danger is with a flare but it doesn't alwats work.  I don't understand why sometimes it works, other times it doesn't and there is no explanation as to why.  A flaw in the design or prerhaps a bug.\n\nDeath is completely irritating because you must start the current level completely from the beginning, meaning even if you're two steps from finishing the level and unlocking the next if you die then you must explore the level and collect everything AGAIN.  I am currently stuck early in the game because after collecting a key to unlock the next level I am confronted with the adversary and cannot avoid or defeat it in anyway.\n\nThere are only autosaves in this game, and the game is only saved at the start of each new section, or level.  Another ignorant developer who thinks they know better than we do on how we want to play again so they forgo manual saves.  I am sick of the this, developers egos or laziness taking my NEED to be able to save the god damn game when I want to.  Auto saves are fine, but a game has to have manual saves as well.\n\nThe game looks and feels creepy with the typical decrepit asylum environment, random creepy sounds like screams and thumping, and random, but limited, dialogue form the protagonist or one other charater. Still, there isn't enough here to really deliver any true scares.   There are very few things you can interact with, there are very few things that aren't static, and even most of the non-static things function rarely to provie jump scares.\n\nI have not come across any puzzles, just the typical notes you find that tell a piece of the story.  Some backtracking is required as you must find both the key and the exit which are typically on opposite ends of the map, and you cannot get the key until you've collected all the specific notes in the area.\n\nAll in all this is a very basic game.  Very basic gameplay, very basic and unoriginal story, overly repetitive random levels, and a very poor showing of the Unreal Engine's graphic capabilities.   For as crappy as the game runs with everything turned up there isn't anything to look at that makes you go "Wow!   Unreal Engine 4 is awesome!"\n\nIf ther eis anything good to say about the game then it would be these:  the sound quality is well done, what little voice acting there is is above average, and the last part of teh game, maybe the last 3 levels or perhaps the last 20-30 minutes of the game were much better than the earlier sections.\n\nI really don't recommend this game as it brings absolutely nothing new to the horror genre nor does it get much of the old right.  It doesn't do the Urnreal Engine any favors by being the "first" Unreal 4 game due to it's lack of and kind of visual treats.","August 1, 2015","false","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I played it through once because I had it, so why not.\n\nThe graphics are pretty unimpressive for being  UE4 and the lighting system isn't even that cool.  Glowsticks and flares just turn your screen red/green they aren't even that dynamic.\n\nThe game takes far less than 2 hours to beat, even if you are going slow.  You'll never want to play it again. Not being mean, just saying - there's no reason.   You'll quickly see what it means by "procedural" and randomization and its like < half the game is random, and that portion is by far the most boring part.\n\nNo way I'd ever buy this game for ten bucks.  However, for like .99 cents or 1.99 maybe on sale, I might get it just for the two hour playthrough.  It's like renting a bad movie.  The notes were kinda cool, but pretty cliche and poorly written.

I played it through once because I had it, so why not.\n\nThe graphics are pretty unimpressive for being  UE4 and the lighting system isn't even that cool.  Glowsticks and flares just turn your screen red/green they aren't even that dynamic.\n\nThe game takes far less than 2 hours to beat, even if you are going slow.  You'll never want to play it again. Not being mean, just saying - there's no reason.   You'll quickly see what it means by "procedural" and randomization and its like < half the game is random, and that portion is by far the most boring part.\n\nNo way I'd ever buy this game for ten bucks.  However, for like .99 cents or 1.99 maybe on sale, I might get it just for the two hour playthrough.  It's like renting a bad movie.  The notes were kinda cool, but pretty cliche and poorly written.

Zombie Studios is notorious for producing sub-par products - and Daylight is no exception to that rule: the challenges that it present are laughable at best (in the case of the intended challenge of the witches, which can be avoided by staring at the floor like a shoegaze guitarist and - well, shoe gazing); and absurd at worst (in the case of achievement hunting, which is a chore). Like the gameplay, the story is clunky and poorly delivered. There is a cyclical system to witchery in this world, that begins with the death of witches, and follows a twelve-step program to awaken the power within the witches' descendent.\n\nThe one thing that's charming about the game is the narrator - a spooky doctor who's doing his very best to monologue like Anthony Hopkin's Lecter. His overacting is a source of unexpected levity in an otherwise tedious experience.\n\nThat aside, don't make the same mistake I did. I'm going to finish the long quest of achievement hunting and then uninstall for good.","August 31, 2015","false","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
