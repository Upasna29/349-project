You start with the same ship, collect and lose power-ups as you go. There's 2-way missiles, lasers, spread and such, you can have pretty much all of them at the same time and switch their angles. You also have a shield that lets you absorb projectiles while building a meter that holds it together. Scoring system is as simple as it gets, you just kill everything in sight and collect the points.\n\nEnemies are well varied and their patterns aren't too hard to figure out. Soundtrack is chill, graphics are nice hi-res and bright, sometimes perhaps even too bright. Its a nice little game if you want to relax and have some good time. Word of a warning tho. Veteran mode is brutal because your shield is pretty much useless and the stuff is just everywhere. Second stage is almost impossible if you don't play your game perfectly. Then again its just challenge.","May 24, 2015","true","8.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Also sometimes you're not sure what exactly is part of the background and what is in the foreground.\n\nWhat's good about it:\n-The visuals are stunning; very vibrant colors and mostly nice level designs for a schmup\n-OST is fantastic, fitting to the game for the most part\n-The challenge isn't over-the-top unfair although it's still quite challenging (still yet to try advanced difficulty level), but fun enough to play\n-Power ups are REALLY helpful, especially when you're powered to full capacity, then it's blast to go through the levels.\n\nAlso note:\nThere's a minor learning curve to the game, in which you need to acclimate to the shield and what exactly the shield can absorb, along with the controls and bulky objects.\n\nI'd give this a solid 8/10","June 23, 2015","true","5.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It isn't bad and on sale you might enjoy it but I'm definitely glad I passed this one up on the Dreamcast.  The music is pretty bland, the graphics look out of place like a cut and paste job, and the mechanics of R-Type and its various clones are as tired here as they are elsewhere.  If you are a hori euro-shmup fan you might dig this but I'm glad I opted for Sturmwind (which isn't exactly fantastic either).","September 12, 2015","false","0.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

They take simple ideas and produce mind-bendingly complex gauntlets that require a certain amount of mental gymnastics to even apply for the grade.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFKOE5cuq3Y\n\nI always prefer to get the bad stuff out of the way first and then get to the good stuff. Not that there is much to find fault with, but there is just one issue I have with Redux: Dark Matters and that's with the art assets. They aren't bad per se and you can't see them in images alone. It's hard for me to eloquently explain this so please bear with me while I try to explain myself.\n\nEssentially, all of the artwork exists as-if in a bubble. Perfectly in-focus at all times and never blending in with game. There has been one exception to this and I've made note of it in my Let's Play. There is a moment where your ship passes through a waterfall and it reacts accordingly. Not only does it have an animation for water hitting your ship, it actively pushes your ship down. But outside of this (which I will admit is excellent) one element, everything feels completely separate from another.\n\nBut that's the only negative thing I can say. Everything else about Redux: Dark Matters is excellent. Varied and eclectic power-ups from multi-angle missiles and blasters to bouncing lasers. Excellent boss fights at the end of each level that need to be mastered if you have any hope of beating the game.\n\nPlus the difficulty is fantastic. If you are just an average shmup player, the normal difficulty is excellent. The game is just hard enough and you're equipped with an assortment of tools that (Which you can not spam) help you through tough bullet-hell situations.\n\nThen there is Veteran difficulty level that is true to it's name. I could only beat the first level after completely exhausting all of my lives on Veteran.\n\nRedux: Dark Matters is everything I look for in a shmup.\n\nRecommended.","December 15, 2014","true","2.0"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","9","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/solrahlx/recommended/336930/","solrahlx","Rayge","http://steamcommunity.com/id/solrahlx/","1604 products in account","A mediocre indie shooter that was released on the Dreamcast. It's a horizontal shoot'em up that really doesn't bring anything new to the table and comes off as being very basic. The controls seems floaty at first, but I quickly got accustomed to it. The game's art direction is definitely off putting for me as everything seems too big and toyish. There are 2 tracks in the game that sound pretty good Stage 7 and the game over screen. The rest of the tracks are forgettable. The game itself is pretty bare bones with its features. There are no replays, no online leader boards, but there's at least some graphic settings and remappable options in the settings .exe.\n\nAlmost all of the stages are ridiculously easy to get through with bosses offering some challenge. The difficulty just isn't there until Stage 7 where all hell breaks loose. It almost seems like all their work in terms of bullet patterns went only to that stage.  There are other shooters who have gone this route and have done a better job with it. It's definitely not a horrible game at all and playing it on Veteran really brings a new twist to the game and makes it a bit more entertaining. Buy this only if you're really into STGs and just want something to scratch that itch in between notable releases.\n\nAlso, I've played this game for about 6 or 7 hours. I must have left the game on during a weekend trip or something.","October 4, 2015","false","78.7"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"
