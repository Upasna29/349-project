The bosses look amazing but they tend to overstay their welcome and the battles drag out for too long. This is especially true on the higher difficulties.\n\nIt's a great reimagining of a classic title and I wholeheartedly recommend picking this up if you enjoy the faster First person shooter titles of the days of old.\n\nFlying Wild Hog has done an excellent job with this one.\nShadow Warrior has proven to truly belong alongside the greats of the genre.","September 30, 2013","true","38.6"," 559 of 582 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","559","582","0","8"

Shadow Warrior is a brilliant and (literally) funny reboot (let's just call if that) of the 1997 game of the same name.\n\nThe graphics are colorful, with just enough detail in them. Animations are a bit hit and miss, especially for the human(-like) characters. But still very good. The sword attacks are awesome and just as satisfying as other first person games with the same sort of melee combat, like Dead Island and Zeno Clash. Near the end of the game I was mostly using the sword; before that I used the weapons. But the game is just so much cooler with a sword.\n\nBoss fights all come down to firefights, however, so it's a bit disappointing that you aren't given a choice there. Gave me a bit of a Deus Ex Human Revolution vibe, even though it can't really be compared.\n\nSome of the weapons lack power, by the way, but maybe it's because the game tries to force you to use your sword. Killing enemies will earn you points and once you earn enough of them you can spend them on your skill tree(s). There are several trees; one for weapons, one for sword attacks and one for magic like shields and healing.\n\nAnd like I said, it's a long game. Finishing the 17 chapters will take you at least 15 hours. That's about 2-3 times longer than most of the other first person shooters. Great stuff right there.\nThe story is also surprisingly good and the voice acting is mostly top notch.\n\nAll in all I enjoyed Shadow Warrior way more than I thought I would. It's a solid, fun game that is definitely worth the price, and time.\n\n[Rating: 88/100]","October 3, 2013","true","15.4"," 299 of 327 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","299","327","0","3"

The humor is light-hearted and witty and avoids being overly immature.  The banter between Lo Wang and Hoji is excellent and the game has enough great "Wang" jokes to fill a book.\n\nThe game has a lot of content.  There are 17 large, but linear levels with a good amount of secrets and easter eggs to discover.  The campaign took me roughly 20 hours to complete on normal difficulty.  Once you get through the campaign there are options that open up for an EX playthrough where you get to playthrough again and keep all of your upgrades as well as an Expert playthrough where you start from scratch and get no savepoints mid-level.  There was also a free Survival Mode added in by the developers post-release so there is definitely a lot of value here for the money.\n\nCombat flowed very smooth and was nicely varied.  Shadow Warrior follows a Serious Sam style gameplay where enemies can come in large groups and cover is largely irrelevant.  You get a good number of weapons added to your arsenal as you progress through the game and can carry all of them with you.  The combat also has a fantastic melee element with the katana that you start the game with.  I found the katana to be the main weapon of choice throughout the game, as it seemed a bit overpowered compared to the guns, and the "Kill Bill" style dismemberments and decapitations were very satisfying.\n\nThere is also a nice progression and upgrade system that adds even more to the combat system.  You can train skills and obtain KI powers that allow Lo Wang to move faster, heal himself better and gain special combat abilities and special combos.  You can also upgrade each of the games weapons to make them even more effective.\n\nOverall I was surprised at how good this game was.  It managed to sufficiently modernize the classic Shadow Warrior while keeping true to the old-school FPS style gameplay.  In this regard Shadow Warrior was able to accomplish what Duke Nukem Forever was not able to.  If you are a fan of old-school, fast paced FPS action with a satirical sense of humor then I highly recommend this game.","April 11, 2014","true","22.4"," 208 of 217 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","208","217","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Deltazorian/recommended/233130/","Deltazorian","Deltazorian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Deltazorian/","83 products in account","Welcome, this is my first serious review and I hope you have fun reading it!\n\nShadow Warrior isn't what you would consider to be a reboot or a remake of an older title. The best term to consider it as would be to call it a 'Re-Imagining'. Everything in Shadow Warrior pays homage to the 1997 version, ranging from the deliberately cheesy humour to the bombastic and downright ridiculous arsenal of weapons.\n\nThis game is developed by 'Flying Wild Hog', whom of which are known for creating 'Hard Reset'.\n\nYou are Lo Wang a presumably mid thirties agent of Zilla enterprises, who is tasked with finding the fabled katana known only as the Nobitsura Kage. However as one may expect, things do not go to plan. You are immediately introduced to the smooth, fast and visceral combat in the form of the katana. The hit registration feels perfect as you begin slicing your way through hordes of foes. I won't say much about the story anymore, with the exception of the fact that you are quickly introduced to a magical being who gives you awesome flashing abilities.\n\nThe special powers you recieve allow for some stylish ways to decapitate your enemies, whether it be by flinging a blade of energy at their pathetic head or whether you prefer to do a 360 degree spin to destroy multiple enemies at once. The sword play feels so great and as a result you'll be spending most of your time using the katana whilst also trying to achieve the best possible score in a segment of each level.\n\nThe gunplay however, starts of relatively weak due to the lack weight when firing certain types of weapons. This is especailly prevalent in the revolver because of the lackluster sound and uninspired concept. But as the game drip feeds you more and more weapons, the more and more awesome they become. Thanks to weapon upgrading system, you can add absurd alternate firing modes to certain weapons. Ever wanted to launch all of your rocket launcher ammo at once? Well now you can!\n\nThe game for the most part looks absolutely beautiful, and I believe that is due to the vibrant colour palette that the developers decided to use. The textures looks high res and the lighting effects can cause you to lose yourself in the environment. My only concern in terms of the graphics is that they tend to over-use warm colours a lot, and that can cause some difficulty in navigating your way around the level due to the objective flashing orange.\n\nSpeaking of levels...\nThe level design is for the most part average, the segments of the level don't feel like they connect together to form one cohesive environment. Instead it feels like a mish mash of rooms filled with enemies to fight with the occassional area that branches out and allows you to explore. Despite the well thought out concepts and aesthetics, the levels are generally not very interesting.\n\nNow to my final gripe, the boss battles.\nThey essentially feel like a larger more powerful version of the games beefier enemies that take a substantially longer time to kill. These battles aren't all that engaging to participate in as they feel repetitive and downright boring. The boss battles goes as follows. Wear down boss-> Shoot Important Part-> Wear down Boss-> Rinse and repeat.\n\nDo I think that this game is worth a purchase?\nHeck yes, this game puts AAA first person release titles to shame! The combat is absolutely amazing and I never tired of it (With the exception of the boss battles) and there's enough snarky and crude humour to please everybody. So, if you enjoy good FPS games with a fantastic feel of badass, Shadow Warrior is definitely one to pick up.\n\nFeedback and criticism is welcome!","October 28, 2014","true","10.5"," 222 of 244 people (91%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","91","222","244","5","7"

You are sent by your boss to retrieve the Legendary Sword "Nobitsura-Kage" from a Japanese Mafia Leader. After you slice some of his henchman's heads , he and his demon companion Hoji capture you. After a few hours you wake up in a tapped in a cage. A demon aids you by giving you a sword which you use to escape with , but nothing seems to be alright as a Demon Invasion has just begun. Now You and Hoji make an unusual alliance together in order to find the Nobitsura Kage and bring an end to the Demon Invasion.\nGameplayShadow Warrior's gameplay is Solid.\nThere are 7 weapons to choose from with each having 3 upgrades to buy\nThe most unique of them is the Katana. It is like your usual melee weapon tho in this game it is one of the most useful. You can learn diffrent skills for your Katana giving it some special moves whcih are rly useful in battle.\nThere is the "skills" section where you can learn new skills for the exchange of "karma points" which give you some sweet enchancements to your character that will aid you throughout your adventure.\nThere are 4 diffrent Powers you can learn with each one having 4 upgrade\nThey are very useful in combat as by using them you can easily turn the tide of battle in your favor\nFor example: There is a power which can heal you , a power which can shield you from enemy attacks and the 2 others can stun enemies.\nEvery single battle of the game consists of diffrent waves of enemies and after each one you get a score from 1 to 5 stars of how well you've done. The score is based on the variety of weapons and powers used , enviromental damage and how quick you've killed them. The more variety the bigger the score!\nGraphicsThe artstyle of the game is just breathtaking! It is based around the Japanese culture which makes it look unique compared to other FPS games.

Being developed by a different studio, it’s obviously a different experience. But the core gameplay and twisted humour are still present for hardcore fans to enjoy.\n\nThe story is where Shadow Warrior falls flat, but the gameplay and graphics of Shadow Warrior are where it really shines. Fans of the original will feel right at home. The various weapons and upgrades keep the gameplay interesting and the new addition of “special abilities”, adds further customization to each confrontation. Although a minor weapon in the original game, swordplay is a big part of the new Shadow Warrior. The sword is so much fun to use, with different combos and powerful attacks you can chain together. I found myself preferring the sword instead of the guns (which are still very fun to use).\n\nSomething I didn't like about the game was the secrets. In the original game they were usually very well hidden and in some cases, quite extravagant. This reboot had plenty of secrets, but they were very basic, usually just hidden doors that led to small rooms with a few supplies.\n\nOn the whole, I really enjoyed Shadow Warrior. The length of the campaign is decent and the game has enough diversity with enemies and weapons to keep things from getting too repetitive. The story was shallow and almost non-existent, but I was too busy killing things to worry about it too much.\n","November 27, 2013","true","14.0"," 176 of 207 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","176","207","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vampluci/recommended/233130/","vampluci","Vampcinda","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vampluci/","464 products in account","Shadow Warrior is an ultra-fast hack 'n slash FPS game propelled forward in a blinding pace with action packed combat using guns, explosives, magic and a deadly katana in an incredibly varied setting with some of the most stunning visuals I have seen to date. Add on top of that a deep and compelling story garnished with tons of humor and cliché catch-phrases that could make you wonder if the game was not taking itself very serious; an assumption you will soon come to realize is as false as false can be.\n\nThe new Shadow Warrior is not so much a remake of the original, but rather a re-envisioning of the old 1997 release. The zaney humor, the slice-and-dice gamplay and Lo Wang the protagonist is still the main drive of the game, but the experience  of this latest incarnation as a whole is a much more greater, better and more enthralling undertaking.\n\nYou still play as the not-so-subtle Lo Wang, a martial arts expert with an ego of some considerable size. Very early on, due to some minor complications with a powerful japanese entrepreneur (or mafia boss, basically), you get hitched up with a demonic spirit named Hoji, who gifts you with magical powers and guides you through a trail-blazing adventure to collect 3 pieces of an ancient and powerful sword - the Nobitsura Kage. Your agenda for this undertaking is to retrieve the sword for your boss, who will pay a handsome reward for the blade. Hoji's agenda, however, is an entirely different one, and you are getting more and more involved in it with every (quick) step.\n\nShadow Warrior is one of the rare FPS games with an actual story worth listening to. In fact, it tells a story that one would have expected from a grand role playing game, or an adventure game. Every level brings gives you a little extra story and background lore, and every bit of information you uncover about Hoji's story and the legend of the Nobitsura Kage makes you realize that this game is something special. I can tell you this much; the number of FPS games that have moved me so deeply that I was in tears and goosebumps at the end are few and far inbetween. But Shadow Warrior is one such.\n\nThe gameplay features a decent arsenal of deadly weapons, from handguns and shotguns, dual uzis to flame throwers, a high-powered crossbow and even a rocket launcher. Each weapon can be upgraded for extra functionality or alternate fire modes through an upgrade menu that is accessible ay any time. Purchasing an upgrade costs money, which can be found throughout the games by looting chests and cabinets or simply lying around the environment. As such, exploring each level is recommended.\n\nBut the staple weapon of the game is no doubt the Katana. The melee combat in Shadow Warrior is eminent. It it fast, fun, spectacular and very skill-based. You can perform fast and precise dodges while chaining multiple different slashes and powerful magical attacks to create devastating combos on your opponents who you will literally be slicing and dicing into little bits. Heads, arms, legs and even torsos will fly in sprays of blood. Killing enemies in specatular and varied ways will reward you with Karma (and you can dispatch of them in truly varied ways once you unlock and master the many different attacks) which you can spend in the upgrade menu to improve Lo Wang's many different attributes. Deal more damage, move faster, increased health, chance of finding more and better loot and so on and so forth.\n\nAgain, exploration is a key word. The more you explore, the more currency for your various upgrades you will find. Not to mention many funny and wacky easter eggs, such as hidden rooms created in the old 1997 style graphics with flat and boxy textures. The game is packed with secrets and hidden areas, usually containing extra Karma points. By use of Ki Crystals, which are found throughout the game, you unlock new special powers and magical abilities, which will not only make combat more crazy and fun, but also enhance your options of creating rewarding combos for added Karma rewards. This does, however, mean that if you do not perform too well in combat and don't explore much, the game will get increasingly difficult since you will be missing out on many of those vital upgrades.\n\nAnother strong point of Shadow Warrior are the visuals. They are positively mind blowing! It is, without a doubt, one of the visually most stunningly beautiful games I have ever played. The game takes you through a multitude of different environments, from pink cherry blossom gardens to great bamboo forests, to underground caverns littered with stalagmites and stalagtites and even into the Shadow Realm, a strange and mysterious plane of existence that is arguably even more gorgeous than the afore mentioned areas. Through and through the game is sugary-sweet eye candy that actually leaves you time and opportunity to walk around and enjoy it to the fullest.\n\nDo not be mislead by the story, exploration and RPG-like upgrades though, Shadow Warrior is still a true arcade "twitch" FPS game at heart. It is fast, relentless and brutal. There is no emphasis on realism or tactics what-so-ever. More often than not you are swarmed by 10, 15 or even 20 enemies all at once. It is a pure-breed hack 'n slash, shoot 'n scoot powerhouse based on a completely liniar level progression, and nearly all combat scenarios are triggered events. You walk into a designated area, and portals will spawn to spill forth throngs of enemies. Chop them up and move to the next area, then rinse and repeat. Luckily, doing this is SO MUCH FUN!\n\nI really am struggling to think of any downsides to this game. It has just been an enjoyment from start to finish.\n\n\nSynopsis:\n\n+ Excellent arcade FPS action with many weapons and superb controls\n+ Some of the best melee sword combat I've experienced\n+ Rewards exploration; easter eggs and  secrets aplenty\n+ Lots of humor and nods to the old 1997 game\n+ Incredible graphics and varied level design\n+ Deep and enthralling story\n+ Hoji\n\n- Dodging often gets you killed in stupid ways\n- Needs a fairly strong computer to run well with graphics on high\n- Sword attacks are sometimes unresponsive if chained together too quickly\n- Certain weapons sometimes "lock up" and don't fire if you just switched to them\n- The game can be quite punishing if you do not explore or score good karma during combat\n- Bossfights; they are challenging yes, but all of them use the exact same mechanic.

Easy, you will feel powerfull!!\n\nSo, If you want to enjoy killing a lot, a lot... a lot!!! of demons, play it. :D\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=511800994","September 20, 2015","true","18.7"," 137 of 160 people (86%) found this review helpful 34 people found this review funny","86","137","160","34","2"

If you like to play by yourself, and with a Wang, this game is for you. This game captures the old school feel well, without trying too hard. Unless you're impatient, this should last you about 15-20 hours minimum.\n\nLo Wang is a likeable lead character, and his buddy Hoji, while annoying at first, becomes very charming. You may roll your eyes at the start when you meet the two of them, but they quickly grew on me.\n\nThe combat in this game is very fluid and full of action. The pacing is simplistic, and straight forward, with lots of secrets to explore if that's what you're interested in. You can upgrade Lo Wang himself, his abilites, and his weapons as well. The guns give you all the basics with a few extras. All the guns can be upgraded with bonus abilities, which adds a little spice to the arsenal, but none of them felt very satisfying to use. Not to say they were bad, just rather plain. The Crossbow is the exception, which I felt was most enjoyable once you upgraded it.\n\nThe sword play and health system are notably good IMO. Sword combat is strong and mixes well with the guns, with neither one being obviously better than the other. The health system allows you to regenrate a percentage of your total health using a healing ability, which doesn't stop you from firing your guns or swinging your sword. You can also upgrade your max health, and med kits allow you to heal above your max health giving you some bonus HP.\n\nThe difficulty is something I took issue with though. I played on Hard for 99% of the game, and most of it was fairly manageable. It felt like I was playing something that would be considered "Normal" most of the time. Every now and then however, I found myself facing a part that had a huge spike in difficulty. It's not that the game is too hard, it just gets wildly inconsistent in difficulty throughout.\n\nI'd give it a solid 8/10. $40 is a bit much for this game ($20 being my ideal price), especially since it has no multiplayer, no co-op, and it lacks notable replay value. To their credit, they did later put in a free mode called Survival, where you fight endless monsters. Though, without co-op, or any real point to it, it's more of a time waster when you don't have enough time to commit to something else. Still, they added free content, and gives a little more life blood to the game.\n\nThat all said, they did a good job with this one, and because of that I am going to check out Hard Reset, and hope they continue to make games.","April 7, 2014","true","21.6"," 79 of 83 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","79","83","0","0"

I never played the original back in 1997 as I was busy saving the world from nuclear destruction during the Shadow Moses incident.\n\n….\n\nOne of the things that threw me was the game in steam is tagged as being funny. Which it is but not at first. The characters start to grow on you as you progress through the game. Then become actually funny though admittedly some of the things are timely references. Also the main character is named Lo Wang. So think of anything that can be supplanted by Wang. Its in there. (There is even a George Carlin quote on a fortune cookie, which is a collectible)\n\nThe plot of the game is pretty much a bunch of demons try to get a sword called the Nobitsura Kage. Which, for what it is, remains fairly interesting throughout. It also seems rather serious at times which is part of what threw me off from the funny tag.\n\nTHE GAMEPLAY\nHoly crap, I will honestly miss the gameplay here. Its so smooth, fast and fun. Swordplay mixed with gunplay but lets be honest you came here to cut ♥♥♥♥ up. And it feels great. As you gain more powers and abilities. Firing your weapon while healing or shielding, switching back to your sword while shielding to withstand a barrage to get in close. You truly feel like you have control over both hands. You totally get to be a badass ninja. Though on the downside, the guns feel little underpowered rather they sound underpowered. But that's a very minor complaint.\n\nYou gain Karma points which are used to upgrade things like stats, how much healing and stamina recovery is gained on pickups. Ki crystals which correlate to abilities such as shockwave and flux which stun enemies and similar effects. And all the money you find goes into buying upgrades for the weapons themselves.\n\nThere really is nothing quite as satisfying as watching a demon jump through a portal, rushing in on him and cutting its head off in one fell swoop with a well placed swing.\n\nMy only complaint about the movement is be vary weary of stairs, dashing down them seems to make you accelerate and instantly kill you. It seems to have you dash horizontally along the X axis then drop you rather than just move quickly up and down them. Which tapping L.Shift makes you dash, holding makes you sprint. So plan your descent down the stairs.\n\nI'll end by saying one of the more memorable funny bits during the game. After killing one of the bosses Wang says “Weak as a babies fart” I'm not sure why but it made me laugh out loud. I think it was the timing.","August 19, 2015","true","9.9"," 65 of 72 people (90%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","90","65","72","15","1"

Now, I'm not very good at FPS games and don't play them too much, so take that with a grain of salt. I'm more of a hack-n'-slash fan. And when using the katana, this game honestly feels like a first-person hack-n'-slash. The melee combat is that good. You will likely find yourself using the katana in 90% of scenarios, only switching to guns for large enemies, flying enemies, and mobs, because it's just that fun to use.\n\nHowever, the gunplay is nothing to sneeze at. The aiming feels incredibly precise, and each weapon has two methods of firing. There's not many things more satisfying than mowing down a group of demons with dual SMGs, and bullets feel like they have weight behind them.\n\nThe RPG elements add a nice flair to the game. From looking at the forums, it seems like everyone has a different idea of what's important to upgrade, which means the RPG elements are doing their job of building Lo Wang around your playstyle.\n\nThe story is pretty nice, as well. Lo Wang is simply a middleman for his boss, and tries to buy a katana from a martial artist. When he refuses to sell, Wang attempts to take it by force, and soon gets in over his head.\n\nMy only real criticism that dampened the experience was that some of the mini-bosses were incredibly annoying. There is a particular type of enemy with a weak spot on their back that drove me insane...you'll know which one I'm talking about when you reach it.\n\nOutside of that, I doubt any FPS will top this one in my book anytime soon.","November 4, 2014","true","34.8"," 55 of 62 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","55","62","0","0"

You take control over Lo Wang, a cocky guy who has to do some exchange for his boss. Things are going sour, you're getting ambushed and you end up teaming up with equally cocky demon (sic!). That's the beginning of really interesting story that I'm not going to spoil here.\n\nLet's just say that your first (and main) weapon is a katana. And boy, did they make this weapon enjoyable to use :) You also have guns. Lots of guns. Machine gun, flamethrower, crossbow, ninja stars, freaking disembodied demon's head... And you can hold all of them, which is rare for games released nowadays.\n\nYou also have 3 types of upgrades (and 3 'currencies' so to speak to use for said upgrades). Weapon enchancements, powers and skills. You can unlock special attacks, healing boost, defensive moves, special powerful katana attacks, variety is stunning.\n\nThe game encourages exploration. There are a lot of secrets scattered through the game there's also few easter eggs (for example: if you disturb two bunnies which have intimate moment together, you'll wake up a rabbit demon which will attack you in metal music accompaniment :P)\n\nControls are nice and responsive. Your special moves are done by pressing certain combination of buttons. It's fluent and simple. You also have dash move, which comes in handy suprisingly often.\n\nGraphics and aesthetic are great.\n\nEnemies are crazy and satisfying to kill. There are also 3 big boss battles, and I mean big. Like you are fighting an enemy who's like 50 meters high :P\n\nI have only two pet peeves with this game:\nFirst - at a certain point you can clearly see the 'ambush' sort of gameplay that they tried to use. Like you find some important object and bam, it's an ambush, enemies swarming you left and right. It's not Call of Duty bad, where if you don't move the enemies will respawn infinetely (well, disregard :P they will until you kill the spawner :P). Nah, it's obvious what they tried to do. It's not horrible, but pretty transparent and somewhat annoying at times. Good that killing enemies is so fun :P\n\nSecond - there's no map. The game is quite linear, but there are still some parts of the game where I just got lost and didn't know what to do next (usually it had something to do with finding a certain spot to plant explosives or press a button on the wall somwhere)\n\nAll in all - Shadow Warrior is really great game and it saddens me that crap like Call of Duty sells millions of copies and enjoyable gems like Shadow Warrior are neglected.\n\n9/10!","January 11","true","13.0"," 39 of 43 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","39","43","2","1"

What makes this game worth it, what makes it insanely fun is its combat. You use a variety of weapons, spells in the form of ki powers, special attacks and a lot more.\n\n-Skill, weapon and ki customization.\nThe game has a very nice skill customization system that lets you alter the flow of the combat but unlike other games the customization doesn't make you regret that you didn't choose the other path of skills. You get points to upgrade by performing well in combat or finding secrets. You can upgrade your katana skills to unlock amazing and very useful skills like doing a spin that cuts all enemies around you or charging your sword to send a travelling wave that cuts anything in its path. And you can get other skills such as increasing your stamina to dash more often in battle. I never felt I was in a shortage of points and never felt underpowered and that was very nice.\nThe weapons. You pick up lots of weapons through the game. Your first weapon is a Japanese revolver and you can pick up things like shotguns, crossbows, etc. I am a fan of Japan so the game sticking to a Japanese style made me very happy. The weapons stick to the Japanese style as well (The smg has a rising sun painted on its side and other things) so no need to worry about guns feeling out of space when your sword is sheathed. There aren't many customization options but the ones avalaible are sufficient enough because they upgrade the weapons a lot such as dual wielding for smg.You don't need to upgrade the katana's damage with money because you pick up the upgrades by playing the game, that way the game doesn't force you to decide between katana or weapon. You use them both. ♥♥♥♥ing Samurai Hitman.\nThere are also Ki powers that you unlock through the game. You get the points for these not very often so you got to spend your points right. They are extremely fun and essential to combat. There is one I use all the time and upgraded to its max potential that creates a shockwave that travels where you cast it and makes the enemies float for a period of time and let you murder them.\n\n-Graphics and style.\nThe game has a style that mixes Japanese and Chinese cultures but the Japanese side is a lot more dominant. Seeing The Great Wave off Kanagawa while looting houses makes me very happy :D The combat and everything else sticks to this Japanese theme very well. But there are Chinese things mixed in as well, such as Lo Wang or how some places are designed.\nThe game looks great but I think its more because of the map and enemy design than graphics. Graphics are nice but not great. They are not at the point of hurting your eyes but they are certainly not the best.\n\n-Story\nThe concealed build up, the rainy ending. It was a lot more than I expected. This is the best example how a story is made.\n\nNegatives:\n-Can be repetitive or underwhelming at times.\nThe game is certainly filled with combat, amazing map design and amazing encounters that do not let you take a break but sometimes the going can be underwhelming. Even Lo Wang comments on this once, says Oh another massacre, what a nice change of pace. I cannot stress this enough,the pace is absolutely fast and the envirnoments, encounters are breathtaking. But this very fast pace can be underwhelming after a time.\n\n-I haven't finished the game but I imagine the longevity of the game will be a problem.\nThe price tag is not very low if you do not catch a discount, and the game is not that long. I am probably close to the middle of the game with 5 hours of gameplay so consider that wihle buying.\n\n----That was the only negative that affected me, the next two negatives will be just trying my hardest to find something bad in the game since finding something bad in this game is not an easy task.---\n-Graphics\nThe graphics felt a little bit off at the start but its nothing to block the game at all.\n-More skills maybe ?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nSuprisingly amazing, buy it.","November 22, 2014","true","12.7"," 42 of 48 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","42","48","0","9"

Where do you keep your porn?“-Hoji\n\nAfter finishing the game, I have to say it was great. I bought it because of it's concept - Japanese man killing demons using katana and other weapons. But I got a great story, which was unexpected. For it's price, it is more satisfiing than 60€ games.\n\nLo Wang, japanese hitman, is hired for a job. He has to get a sword at any cost. It's not a easy task and...let's say demons appear. He makes a deal with one of them and gets super inhuman powers. Lo Wang continues in his task and uncovers demon's story.\n\nAs you continue through game, you can upgrade weapons, powers and skills:\nWeapons - Each weapon has 3 upgrades, making the weapon more deadly (Akimbo, Laser targeting, Damage increase...)\nPowers - you collect "Ki crystals" that unlock you new moves and combos. I really like "Powers" system. When obtaining power, you will get a tatto. Each tatto symbolizes unique power(Dragon scales=defense and etc...).

The sword combat may start off slow, but it definitely gets a lot better as you learn demonic powers and different styles of sword techniques. The guns in the game also have a Bioshock upgrade system. Each gun comes with the ability to be upgraded 3 times and gives them new abilities along with making it easier to blow stuff up.\n\nIf you like massive carnage, blowing up just about every object in the world and katana sword play, Shadow Warrior doesn't disappoint. It is only single player, but I feel like that's a positive thing since all their time was focused into the main story. Also easily one of the most challenging games if played on the hardest difficulty.

Some 17 years later comes the prequel starring a young Lo Wang. Shadow Warrior 2013 is a unique first person shooter. This is more than a first person shooter. It melds button combination presses of Mortal Kombat into the first person action. Right, right, and alt attack for a health spell that will slowly heal yourself. Forward forward, attack when your sword is drawn for a strong slash. Back, back and alt attack for a ground pound that sends enemies flying into the air. There is a dash move to instantly dart yourself in any direction. It is helpful for staying alive against a flood of enemies. If you hold the button you run with limited stamina. There is a sense of speed and maneuverability that modern first person shooters lack. All these things make Shadow Warrior 2013 different and fresh.\n\nThe basis of the game is travel and combat. You go to different parts of a level, push buttons, break seals and so on. There are no puzzles. Then you find yourself in rooms or arenas that get flooded with enemies. Once the enemies get defeated, the doors unlock. The sheer amount of enemies, the variety of enemies and the chaos that ensues is where the game shines. After killing a cluster of enemies, the game rates you. How does it judge you? Efficiency or weapon variety? I have no idea.\n\nThere isn't much enemy variety in those first two hours. Demons that melee and support demons that shoot. The demons have diverse looks, they can even crawl on walls and swing from lights. If any demon is left alive for too long it can buff itself and become more difficult to kill. Its a nice system. Humans and skeletons are also in the game, but both are really just there for fodder. Humans are easily killed, but at least they have swords or guns. Skeletons are strictly melee. When some enemies die they leave behind their souls that are health instead of needing to find health kits or use your health spell.\n\nAfter the first two hours, the game really begins to flourish. Different enemies needing different tactics. Tall and short shield demons need to have their shields broken. The tall ones launch projectiles and open up their defenses as they do. There are little holes in the tops of their shield if you aim just right. Dreadlocked, dual sword swinging demons that can turn invisible and teleport to or from you. Far away they throw shurikens. Acid balls like mines explode when you get near. Not just that, but acid demons that explode when killed or roll into a ball and shriek as they bowl toward you! Winged demons that spit fireballs at you. When you kill them, they will kamikaze after you!\n\nBig mini bosses, like a minotaur  that will energy whip and then pull you in. He can send a ring of fire out that you need to jump. Finally, he can charge nearby demons. A tall shaman that will rise green flaming skeletons out of the ground. After he summons skeletons, he will create a giant force field until you kill those skeletons. There are hulking chargers that like all games, they charge forward and you need to shoot them in the back. They are smart enough to turn when charging and only charge when you're in an area open enough for them to hit you. At first, these are only mini bosses, but then they become uncommon enemies.\n\nThese are the chess pieces you get stuck in arenas with. Any number of different combinations of enemies. These are more than just square arenas. There are walls and pillars to hide behind, dead ends to get stuck in. Each one is beautiful. Some could be in a horror movie. Lights flickering, chargers breaking through walls hunting you with their eyes glowing lit on fire from your last rocket. Even if you think you're done with one wave, other enemies could continue to flood in. All topped off with winged demons shooting down at you.\n\nThe three mega bosses are colossal and you need to take out their parts. This requires more than aim, it needs dedication, because these battles can be 15 minutes in a 17 hour game. I can't say they're fun or difficult, just a struggle in your endurance.\n\nSo how do you take all these creatures out? You have a katana for melee. This is a fun weapon. Slashes through enemies with buckets of blood. Beheads them, chops off arms and legs. You can see enemies trying to crawl away with no legs or walk away holding a missing limb.  The developers brag about a clean sword button, its a reload button for a weapon that has no ammunition. With the katana, you can also throw shurikens that stun enemies for half a second, but seem laughably useless.\n\nFor guns, there's a pistol, an oozy, a crossbow that feels like a sniper rifle, a giant double barreled shotgun that you can upgrade into a quad barreled shotgun. There is a flame thrower that feels useful against winged demons, a giant rocket launcher and a demon heart. The demon heart can be squeezed to kill lesser demons in a short radius. There are a hand full of turret sections that you can back out of and fight as normal even if using a turret is mandatory to make something happen.\n\nNot just that, but there are ki crystals and statues that let you unlock attacks and perks in a sort of skill tree. The strong attack I mentioned, a whirlwind attack, and a wide slash. Even a force push sort of spell and a soul drain that lets you cheat death by killing an enemy within X number of seconds to revive yourself. There are even perks to find 10% extra money or ammo. Increase your health spell or maximum health in general. The weapons are upgradeable too. Mostly with more damage or accuracy. Some have alt fires.\n\nShadow Warrior 2013 is a gorgeous game even on its lowest settings. Everything seems to glow. Its very colorful and vibrant. The game starts in a sort of tranquil, beautiful Asia, before moving to industrial docks and then to ice mountains. Its all gorgeous to look at. There are plenty of details, graveyards, amazing weather effects, bamboo mazes, and homes to raid. There are things to break, cars and barrels to explode. Even bunnies you can watch hop on each other with pink hearts over their heads.\n\nYou can open up chests and cabinets to find ammo, health packs, money and even armor. There are plenty of secrets off the beaten path. Looking for loot really breaks up the action and enemies don't just leave ammo, so you need to scavenge. The game has an exploration element without getting lost. In fact the game highlights where you should go with glowing doors. That doesn't mean it'll give you an arrow to the doors. You can even turn off the glowing effect if you really want to get lost in where to go next. A lot of times the game will seal off previous parts of a level to limit your back tracking.\n\nThe game plays very old school. You'll need to find keys to unlock doors. Luckily one key unlocks all doors. There are red, blue and green seals you'll need to break before you can enter certain doors.\n\nLet me quickly discuss deal breakers. If anyone out there hates 'head bob' where you noticeably see the camera bob around. There is no way to turn it off. The game can be a beast on your hardware, but there are a lot of settings. There is an error that can crash the game on start up to a dump file. I assume its from the settings and resolution problems. There is a safe mode, but I had to restart my PC to fix it. Finally, Lo Wang's last game was in 1997, his 90s attitude hasn't changed since then. A lot of games have banter and one liners, but some of these seem awful. The sidekick voice in your head throughout the game seems to be channeling Heath Ledger's Joker voice (not character). He is a very sniveling character there to make Lo Wang look cool by comparison.\n\nShadow Warrior 2013's combat depth will make it difficult for any other first person shooter. It is engaging to do button combos and have so much control with dash buttons. Thanks Ryb for the game!","December 27, 2014","true","17.1"," 39 of 47 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","39","47","2","1"

Shadow Warrior goes back to the roots of the genre and forgets all about modern dynamics such as cover, fake realism and the dreadful cinematic handholding a lot of recent games introduced. It's shooting at its core and its fun.\n\nI'm not even going to attempt to explain the story because I was too busy slashing my way through demons to make any sense of it. It honestly did not mater to me. They could have pinned any generic story to the game and my experience with it would have been the same.\n\nI absolutely loved the gameplay in the title. You have your katana, which you will probably end up using the most because its just fun to use it - Pro tip: press R to clean the blood off of it. There's also your typical revolver, uzi, shotgun, flamethrower, demon heart, crossbow, rocket launcher and demon head. All weapons are upgradeable and each have their own special abilities. I found explosive arrows on crossbow to be particularly useful, or dual wielding uzi's for maximum shredding power felt satisfying. Of course squeezing a demon heart to kill all lesser demons around you is always fun... or grabbing a large demon head and shooting a laser from its eyes is effective as well.\n\nThere is an upgrade system which gives passive and active abilities, both offensive and defensive. The active ones in particular act a larger role when it comes to katana swordplay as using them while slashing enemies feels very fluid.\n\nThe technical aspects of the title are satisfactory. Graphically I found the game beautiful. I've encountered minor bugs which did not let me progress to the next chapter so the last autosave had to be reloaded but in the 15 hours of gameplay there is to be had here, that occurred on very few occasions.\n\nIt is nice to see some devs wanting to make shooters that generally feel great and are fun to play. There are no boring cinematics here, extremely linear maps, unneeded handholding. There are cheesy 80's references, fortune cookies that, while also reference a lot of other very fine work, are funny and the developers paid homage to the 90's classic FPS Shadow Warrior. There are bunnies one finds in the act of coitus, which upon gunfire engagement turn into dark demons from hell and attack you. The developers know they made a game, not a movie or a piece of art one hangs on walls and critiques for what its message is.","July 17, 2014","true","13.8"," 23 of 23 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","23","23","0","0"

It wins major points right off the bat for having an actual health meter, multiple weapon inventory and a satisfying combat system with tons of level secrets.  It also has some wonderful snarky humor in it that will give some decent chuckles here and there, playing of course as Lo Wang, the wisecracking samurai badass.  It seems like a game from the heavens compared to what's out there nowadays, but it's not without faults.\n\nThe game is pretty easy on normal mode.  Your katana, while being the most satisfying weapon in the game to use, it's also quite overpowered right out of the gate.  You soak tons of hits, you have an unlimited healing ability right after the tutorial stage and the RPG elements can make an already hard to kill player into an unstoppable death machine, making most of the defensive upgrades feel like you really don't need them.  Personally the only real parts I got stuck on was getting lost in a few levels, but after all the hand holding games are doing these days, it was kind of refreshing not to have the game treat me like an idiot, allowing me to get lost here and there and navigate my own way around.\n\nIn a nutshell, the game is fun and satisfying, but a little too easy, so if you do buy the game, you might consider cranking the difficulty up.","December 3, 2013","true","7.1"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","24","26","3","0"

It "gets it" in all the ways Duke Nukem Forever didn't; the guys at Flying Wild Hog know what made those games fun. Levels are big, twisty, and covered in secrets and interactive bits. There's a strong attempt to avoid the "boxes and corridors" design aesthetic that mostly succeeds, and the game flows at a fairly languid pace (when not in combat) that encourages exploration and messing about with your surroundings, only pressing on when *you* feel like doing it, not because the game is herding you forward.\n\nWhen you do get into combat, everything gets fast paced and very spatially aware. You're expected to dance around and use the entire space you're given in order to play the game, not take cover and wait for enemies to pop up so you can shoot at them. There's zero attempt made at realism and the game is brilliantly playable for it, most evident in the fact that your primary -- and really, if you feel like it, ONLY -- weapon in the game is a katana. You do get guns, sure, but it's made evident early on that really you're mostly here to re-enact the House of Blue Leaves scene from Kill Bill vol. 1 and just hack stuff apart with gleeful abandon until it gets boring. Which it never does.\n\nThere's also a host of RPG-lite upgrades you can purchase using a somewhat alarmingly involved upgrade system. Every weapon can be upgraded in several different ways, there's magic spells to obtain and upgrade as well, and there's an entire subsystem of passive upgrades that can either shore up your weaknesses, specialize in a specific area, or just give you generic boosts like upping your ammo count or increasing the amount of money you can find from pickups. It's a nice carrot to dangle on the end of the exploration stick, and the rewards trickle down at a pleasant pace as you play.\n\nGraphics are far better than they really have any right to be. Everything is done up in a kind of Magical-Realism Japan style. Style takes top billing over practicality, and you'll be a bit terrified at how ridiculously *expensive* all these nice house interiors you're splattering with blood look, but it fits great with the game's warped sense of reality and adds a vaguely surreal, Tarantino-film kind of lens filter to the whole thing. Voice acting is also surprisingly good, with Hoji the Wisecracking Spirit Guide winning as one of the more amusing smartass sidekick/plot mcguffin elements ever seen in a non-Nintendo game.\n\nThis game also updates the parody and plot along with the graphics and gameplay but doesn't forget what made everything in the original work. The humor in the original was a lowbrow (but hilarious) sendup of asian wushu/action movie stereotypes. Kinda like the films it was making fun of though, the humor in the original seems painfully dated if you go back and play it today. It was one of those things you could get away with back in the day when it was originally made, but trying it these days would fall flat. Flying Wild Hog knew this, and the update modernizes the humor without sanitizing it. Lo Wang is still named Lo Wang, and he's still cocky as all hell (if anything it's even worse now), but he's gotten an age shift to about 40 years younger and about 3 orders of magnitude less offensively stereotyped in every single thing he says. The jokes about his name come almost entirely from himself, and even then there's relatively few of them (and they tend to be better written). Mostly it's the banter between Wang and Hoji that paints the game's humor, and their love/hate relationship works out a lot better than original Wang spouting off one-liners in a horrible accent to himself for the entirety of the original game.\n\ntl;dr Flying Wild Hog pulled it off, and made a Shadow Warrior game that looks and plays exactly like the original game had been released in 2013 instead of 1997. Worth the full-price money if you like first person action games, and especially if you played the original. Consider it a must-buy if it goes on sale.\n\n\n\nOh right, forgot to mention: Everything explodes when you shoot it. EVERYTHING. Cars? Explode. Motorcycles? Explode. Lampposts? Explode. Neon signs? Explode, somehow. Arcade machines? Boom. Air conditioners? Will kill everything in a 100 foot radius if you sneeze on them funny. Wood stoves? Shoot fire, then explode. Little pots full of coals with no discernable combustion method except they're vaguely fire-related as a stage prop? ♥♥♥♥ it, they also explode.

Shadow Warrior wisely starts Lo Wang out with just about everything the player needs to have fun from the word GO and brings back the odd blend of monster kiting so that you can blow up environmental hazards, like cars, explosive barrels or electrified objects, to create a cascade of explosions and bloody chunks.\n\nLo Wang is a big idiot, but that's what makes him fun. The dialogue is surprisingly casual and made me laugh plenty of times in the midst of the demonic invasion. The voice acting is great and his cluelessness and comic book fantasies are both endearing and hilarious. The end of the story took a tonal one-eighty that was too heavy handed after the casually kitchy tone, but it sure beat the utter cliffhanger that Hard Reset ended on and resolved the story of the vengeful spirit and constant companion, Hoji, and Lo Wang.\nProbably my favorite bits of dialogue were the set of whiny, pained lines tied to taking too much damage... A constant reminder that Lo Wang is still comedically human despite becoming his own original character.\n\nThe game still has some similar UI pitfalls retained from Hard Reset by allowing the player to craft their game into a boring one... A quick recap on Hard Reset: You started out with practically nothing, and you were presented with an upgrade tree that could route the player into using very boring weaponry for a very long time if they didn't experiment with unlocking alternate-fire-modes that vastly changed the behavior of the weapons.\n\nThere's an unintuitive paradox between picking what I think are important passives, and the immediate reward of unlocking the ability to use all the Sword Arts and Ki Powers. For example, FIND MORE MONEY is critical to feeding into your ability to unlock more fun weapon upgrades... Especially their ALTERNATE FIRE, which is tantamount to unlocking a new basic ability... Otherwise, you're left with a passively powered-up toolset that would probably get stale.\n\nAll in all though, it's a fun game that has some odd quirks (Lo Wang can't swim, some checkpoints are poorly placed later in the game, and dashing off of a ledge can apply deadly fall damage).\n\nI spent my time dashing around hordes of demons to corral them up into the largest groups, jump in the middle and then cut them all down in the midst of an explosive firestorm.","March 17","true","17.0"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

I want to start this review off by saying that the developers released a patch for the game to use DirectX11 and better support for 64-bit systems, about two years after it's release. These guys deserve your money.\n\nNow, like many fans of the old Shadow Warrior, I was a little worried because I heard about all the changes from the gameplay to Wang's character himself, but the game still does have some "old-school" elements. While the levels are much more linear than the original, exploring and going off trail is still worth it as there are many secrets to be found and the gameplay is still very fast, intense and immersive. You can still find hentai chicks bathing themselves and singing, and even find secrets taking you back to levels from the old-school Shadow Warrior.\n\nYou're gonna use that katana a LOT. It's just so damn fun to use! Throughout the game, you'll be upgrading your katana and learning new attacks for it which will keep the sword feeling fresh. If you want to try out something new, in the pause menu you can change what kind of Katana you can use, including some laser/lightsaber thing and even the Excalibat from Rise of the Triad!\n\nThe guns are a lot of fun to use as well and you'll be upgrading those too. It has some of the same weapons from the original, such as the demon heart, demon head, rocket launcher (which freakin' kicks ♥♥♥ in this game), Uzi's (and dual wielding of course), a tearing-♥♥♥ shotgun (which gets a 4-shot chamber just like the original) as well as some added ones like a sexy and powerful Revolver, a big crossbow that can be upgraded to detonate explosions at will, and more.\n\nAside from weapons, you can also upgrade Wang himself and gain some other special powers that you will find out for yourself.\n\nAnd obviously, there's Lo Wang. Duke Nukem's bother from another mother. I don't think this was intended, but I like to think of this as Lo Wang when he was younger and how he became so wise and powerful. The way he shaves his head and gets tattoos later on in the game makes him look like the classic Wang we know, so that was pretty sweet too.\nLo Wang is still an ♥♥♥ (he even claims to be in the game) and he's still full of awesome one-liners that you'll want to remember and use on people later on in real life because it's cliche. His voice acting is just great, from the cutscenes, to his trash-talking enemies, to his occasional scream from swinging the Katana so hard, to his screams and cursing when taking damage. It makes you feel like you're Wang almost.\n\nOh yeah, the cutscenes. I'm never a fan of cutscenes, or even stories in video games in general, but I did not skip a single cutscene in this game. The story is solid and will suck you in! (the cutscenes are skippable if you don't want to watch them.) Lastly, the graphics in this game may be the best I've seen yet. The normals, bumpmaps and lighting in this game is insane, very impressed on how it keeps the framerate so fluid especially with hordes of enemies attacking you in these overwhelmingly beautiful worlds.\n\nThere's so much I want to say, but so much that I don't want to spoil for you. You must try this game for yourself. If it means waiting for a sale, fine - but this game is worth more than it's usual $9.99 when it's 75% off (which is usually the discount it has). So if you want a modernized throwback of one of your favorite old-school games, grab this, you won't be disappointed. If you want a throwback to an old-school game that still keeps the old-school non-linear fast gameplay but with modern and pretty graphics, then grab Rise of the Triad. Wang is there too!","September 26, 2014","true","47.7"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","0"

At the time I hadn't known that it was developed by the same team that created Hard Reset (A stellar title).  This game shares the same design philosophy that Flying Wild Hog used for its other amazing game.  Shadow Warrior is great on a lot of levels.  Combat feels better than a run of the mill hack and slash or FPS in that tearing through enemies and ripping their corpses to ribbons never gets old.  I've blown up demons, torn them from stem to stern with my sword, and riddled them with bullets and it feels just as fresh as the first time doing so.\n\nThe game looks and sounds incredible as well.  The graphics are stunning when set to max and the soundtrack fits the game perfectly.  Not to mention the voice acting and characters are perfect for this sort of game.  So far I've played through a majority of the title and once complete I'll more than likely replay it on a higher difficulty; something I did with Hard Reset.\n\nThese guys make quality games and this is no exception.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/astralchaos/recommended/233130/","astralchaos","Falem","http://steamcommunity.com/id/astralchaos/","1065 products in account","Summary\nShadow Warrior is a action packed single player that offers the best katana gameplay I experienced. Wang is the protagonist, a bodyguard of Zilla Enterprises, looking to collect parts of a sword and assemble it to create a very powerful weapon. Unravel the mystery of the demons who are invading the human world. The sirens who protect the sword from the demons, and the guardians who protect the sword pieces from being gathered.\n\nHumor\nThe companion that follows you around is actually pretty amusing and the dynamic between him and Wang work well. Constantly making jabs at you throughout the game really adds humor that actually works with the game rather than against since it doesn’t feel out of place. An example of this is on chapter 12, you teleport into a new area, nearly fell off the mountain and lived by grasping onto a broken bridge.\n\nWang: You suck!\nWang: Do you enjoy dropping me like that?\nCompanion: Just trying to land you in the air, it beats materializing a couple of feet underground\nWang: Your logic is sound\n\nWeapons\nThe katana and powers are far more effective against enemies than guns except in some instances where having distance between you and a mini-boss is beneficial. Guns are mostly used for bosses even though they could be used for interesting combos to get a higher score during fights for more karma and better position in the leaderboard. I highly recommend using the crossbow, rocket launcher, and shotgun throughout the game.\n\nMovement\nBe constantly on the move or you are going to take quite a bit of damage. The game has enough enemy variations and threats to make you constantly have to be on the move to avoid being hit.\n\nThe jumping in this game is pretty average which in case you're wondering means its bad. The dashing is far superior in this game which you will always use in combat since its far more effective for getting away from enemy attacks. The jumping I found was only useful when i used explosives near me to blow up groups of enemies i threw down when using the tiger skill. Overall movement in this game is a big step up from the previous game this engine was used for Hard Reset.\n\nLevel Design\nThe level design itself is not as complex as others would like however there are many areas to explore which rewards you with money. There are also secrets that have a retro graphic theme style to it which pays tribute to the game the remake is based on. The only issue I have with the level design itself is that certain maps have elements which can be incredibly annoying like the platforming level where you can fall if you are not precise about where you jump.\n\nEnemies\nThe variety of enemies mixes up the gameplay and allows the player to come up with interesting ways to deal with multiple enemies at once or certain types that would otherwise kill you. What makes the enemies really stick out is their ability to rage. Their rage ability makes them go much faster and hit for more which means you need to either take them out fast or calm them down before they strike you down.\n\nPeople tend to use the Divider of Heaven for most enemies seeing as how you can kill enemies in a row with its  piercing effects while being in constant movement.\n\nBosses\nThe bosses are towering impressive looking monsters of death with nice animations and environments that you fight them in. Ultimately the bosses feel boring as a result of their ability to regenerate armor back on the weakness spots exposed. It really becomes a chore to constantly take down the armor off bosses just to hit the crystal which has a iffy hitbox.\n\nDifficulty\nHeroic mode offered a great challenge of having to clear a whole level without dying once, or you would be reset to the start of that level. It was quite hard at times considering that the staircases could kill you if you dashed down them too fast. The chapter 12 was particularly bad since there were many gimmicks like limiting your vision and spamming tons of suicidal monsters to attempt to kill you while you were limited in movement since you were stuck on a train.\n\nConclusion\nIf you are a fan of games that are like quake,painkiller,serious sam, look no further for another dose of crazy action just don't expect the bosses to be climatic...","August 19, 2014","true","127.9"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

First let me highlight the good bits:\n\n* Lots of humor, lots of swearing, totally doesn't take itself seriously. Shadow warrior makes fun of itself just as much as it makes fun of other games, and that's great. Lots of callbacks to pop culture and other games.\n* The boss fights are really, really cool and on a huge, epic scale, they're very reminiscent of the "classic" boss experience and it's fantastic.\n* Lots of variety in weapons.\n* Interesting level design.\n* The design and graphics, and the style, seem to work as long as you don't look too hard at any particular thing. Which you can't anyway because it's really fast paced and I like that.\n* SWORD COMBAT!!!! (there's no blocking but you kind of don't need to)\n* The little details, like chopping up demons into little bits after they're dead and seeing how the devs carefully managed to make the models separate in a realistic way with plenty of gore and blood, and I think that sort of thing is really fun.\n\nOkay. This is all my personal opinion, I've read lots of reviews and heaps of people did like it. My main, big big issue with this game is how annoying it was. It dragged on and on and on and kept making me repeat bits of the same level over and over, fighting the same enemies again and again. It's not fun when it's so repetitive! It felt like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ chore to keep playing but I really wanted to see the ending. You fight through a level only to find your path blocked and you need the key, so you go back, find it, go back towards the gate and whoops, there are the same enemies again. I felt myself asking every time I killed them all "are we done yet?" Apparently not because they come in identical waves and waves, and they throw more and more minibosses at you like they're regular enemies.\n\nIt is not fun to make players do the same thing over and over again with very little variety. There are some enemies (particuarly the minibosses) that are really tricky to kill and apparently the devs' idea of fun is to toss you in a small room with multiple of these like "here, try this!" and when you win it's like "okay, now do it again!" It's so frustrating! And every now and then it's like they remembered, "oh they haven't seen this particular enemy in a while, let's just like, flood an entire room with them, that's fun right?" And it just gets boring after a while, and that boredom leads to frustration when it's so relentlessly repeated over and over.\n\nThere were some really cool unique bits, and I was totally hooked from the very beginning, it was cheesy and hilarious but about halfway through I just felt like I was going through the motions. It really takes you out of the immersion and reminds you that you're pressing buttons on a keyboard and clicking a mouse over and over. I reckon the best kind of game lets you forget what you're doing and really engrosses you in the whole setting and story, but I didn't feel it here. Maybe if it were shorter, or if there were more variety, then it would have been totally terrific.","August 31, 2014","false","8.5"," 99 of 171 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","99","171","3","1"

First there was the wonderful homage to the 80s known as Blood Dragon and then there was the very faithful Rise of the Triad reboot, but Shadow Warrior rose above even those great games. As a HUGE fan of the original 3D Realms classic, this new Shadow Warrior filled me with so much delight. Never before has melee combat been more satisfying in a FPS. The guns were badass, but the real star of the show was your trusty blade. Shadow Warrior rose the bar (or katana) when it comes to getting close and personal. The katana is just so incredibly fun to use.\n\nI was even suprised by this game's story in how it actually managed to grab me. I was expecting some kind of silly excuse plot which is par for the course for retro style shooters, but Shadow Warrior actually had a very well-told story that made me care for what was happening. Instead of just having a reason to kill some demons you've got this wonderful tale that's both tragic and beautiful. Instead of just being a walking sterotype, Lo Wang this time around is an actual character. During the course of his adventure he develops and goes through a character arc. He's both witty and badass. Also there's his demon friend Hoji. Hoji was just wonderful.\n\nThis new Shadow Warrior not only manages to do the original justice, but might actually be superior to it. Much thanks to Flying Wild Hog for delivering this amazing game. I'm really looking forward to seeing what else they deliver in the future, Whether it be more Shadow Warrior or something else. They're defintely on my list of favorite developers.\n\nLast thing I'd like to mention is the game's satisfying length.  The game is a nice solid 14 hours long and has a lot of replay value. The RPG-style upgrade system makes for a lot of replay value.","October 8, 2013","true","147.5"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","1"

Somewhat a failure and received widespread panning.\n\nAnd then there's the classic Doom, which led to the new DOOM (2016) released recently. Not bad, but plays entirely differently from the FPS pioneer.\n\nNow look at Shadow Warrior, which claims to be a, say, "re-imagination" of the classic Shadow Warrior. However, it is not much different than Duke Nukem Forever or DOOM (2016). See, by "re-imagination" it always means better graphics, more interesting gameplay mechanics and etc., but you have to remember, if you're expecting the same experience as the classic version of the game, you will not get it.\n\nBut that does not mean it's not a good game. It's a great game, in fact it's great if you had never played the original classic Shadow Warrior. You'll just have some difficulties adjusting to the new mechanics if you are playing this because you played the original.\n\nDid I also mention there were not many games in the market where you can graphically dismember demons?

And they've done it again. Shadow Warrior is a visually excellent first-person shooter that encourages you to utilise all the various skills at your disposal. Swordplay, shurikens, and magical attacks and defences as well as the usual arsenal of impressive guns. Take it from a fat-fingered gamer, the combat is elegant and easy to use.\n\nAs other reviewers have noted, the voice acting is of a decent standard, with humour that is often crude but (most of the time) manages to avoid immaturity. Cutscenes are short and can be skipped if you're impatient, and there is excellent replay value in the form of EX Mode, which means you can replay the game with all the upgrades and weapons you earned in the first playthrough.

I couldn't tell you where exactly the love is going towards, be it the old Shadow Warrior, the old shooter genre in general, martial art action/drama films, Eastern pop fiction or just good game development practice. But one thing is certain: this has got to be one of the most surprisingly high quality games I've ever encountered. While initially excited about Shadow Warrior making a comeback, I had my doubts about this game, I had thought that Devolver was going to try and ride on the success it was getting with Croteam's Serious Sam 3 and milk games of similar genre for all its worth in the style of Activision's usual workings, and after playing Hard Reset I had once thought Flying Wild Hog a group similar to The Farm 51 in that they were a studio no longer in the glory days of People Can Fly, and while trying their hardest weren't quite yet at that standard of quality people like me would be paying attention to.\n\nI was wrong. I was wrong on every front. Not only has Devolver proved me wrong and established its a publisher willing to put time and money into a product as absurd and obscure as Shadow Warrior, but Flying Wild Hog has also proven to me that they were the studio that cleary are the best of the people that fled People Can Fly, and have managed to take an old magic to soaring new heights.\n\nThis game is something of a small miracle; its the video game equivilant of The Lego Movie. It is baffling just how polished and sophisticated this game's mechanics are. The sword combat is sharp and absolutely sublime, so much that it feels alien, like it should belong in another genre, in a game that would play like Devil May Cry or something from the works of Platinum Games. The moves and powers you can pull off with the sword are visercal and satisfying, and enemies will dismember like paper mache origami made from blood and internals. The guns meanwhile feel like the best parts of Painkiller and Bulletstorm with the visercal satisfaction of the former and the stragetic rewarding of the latter. There's no gun that's a giant stakegun or a weapon that'll let you steer sniper rounds up the taints of enemies, but there's a gun that'll shoot high-velocity, explosive crossbow bolts, and baby, I couldn't ask for anything more delightfully enjoyable.\n\nAnd its all because of that keyword: love. There was no reason this game should have been this good, or even good at all, but because of the love from a small American publisher and an even smaller Polish developer, this game has hit completely out of the park in every possible way.\n\nI cannot stress this enough: you need to try this game. Its a perfect 10/10, and its forever put Devolver and Flying Wild Hog on my radar.","July 28, 2014","true","21.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","1"

On top of the sharp combat, it's got witty dialog and a pretty engaging plot, not to mention a fantastic choice of characters. Possibly my favorite aspect is the sheer number of secrets nestled cleverly in the game. If I had to be critical, the combat can get a bit grindy toward the end, and I do kind of wish some of the weapons were more creative  (like flamethrower? Really?).

It takes a step back towards the golden age of FPS when its predecessor was released. It doesn't take itself too seriously which I found refreshing and it's packed with immature humour and one-liners that make you giggle every time you hear them. In contrast it is also unbelievably bloody at times which mature gamers might appreciate. The levels are still mostly linear but they are rarely interrupted by scripted events and cutscenes. Level variety is good and the environments are gorgeous. Enemy and weapon variety is average but the game has a nice melee combat system and you'll probably end up using the sword more than any other weapon. The graphics are solid and work really well with the overall design. The story is what you'd expect from a shooter but it doesn't disappoint. The price is also quite reasonable considering the length of the game. I'd recommend getting it even at full price but if you're patient you might want to wait.

Lo Wang's humor (which has a bit changed) and crazy action are still there. BTW I wouldn't ever think that Shadow Warrior would have a dramatic ending, but the story was decent. It was well worth the $10 I paid on the winter sales. Highly recommended to Lo Wang fans.\n\nDo you want to wash Wang or do you want to watch Wang wash Wang?","January 12, 2014","true","16.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","6","6","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/233130/","vicrabb","Vic=HKC=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/","1793 products in account","This game seduced me first because of katana (one of my favorite weapons for melee in L4D2, Killing Floor, Hotline Miami, etc etc.). Then I fell in love with the asian settings. And that game got me in the core with the katana again. Because hey, I'm bad with melee weapons and yet, with Shadow Warrior, I'm mastering the art of slicing demons.\n\nShadow Warrior is a sort of remake of Shadow Warrior... the 90's game, that was a FPS with ninja weapons and demons or aliens or I never identified the race of the enemies. Here, in the remake, it's clearly creatures from the Asian mythology, from the other world.\n\nLo Wang, the hero, is somewhat macho, very sure of himself and very dedicated to his task. He acquires some powers and he has companion, Hoji, whose story is revealed during the game.\n\nLike I've said, it's the first time that I feel great with melee. While Lo Wang has nice guns (necessary when you're swarmed by enemies), the katana is still very useful and deadly.\n\nShadow Warrior is a very good game.... and could have been perfect if it didn't feel like an arena game. You can't advance in the story if you don't clean the area. And after a moment, seeing always the same is kinda irritating. Some passages are really hard even in the easiest difficulty. Yet, you find yourself wanting to push through.\n\nAnd Shadow Warrior kept his humour. I played the Shadow Warrior Classic Redux and the original version and that remake is keeping the tradition of fortune cookies with silly sentences. And the rabbits are also there. And the anime girls too.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful. Some landscapes are really good. Besides, they're diversified: from Zilla fortress to his docks to the other world to the city...\n\nI loved the soundtrack. I really enjoyed it.\n\nI recommend that game. You have to try it.","October 27, 2013","true","31.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

You start off on a quest to obtain a piece of a rare sword, which eventually escalates into an all-out war between the demon and human worlds. Early on you obtain a companion in the form of a demonic spirit named Hoji who provides some great humor and exposition during the slower parts of the game.\n\nThe gameplay is exactly what you hope for in a retro remake like this. You have a nice (and upgradable) health bar and can heal up with health packs and armor pickups. You won’t find yourself hiding behind a dumpster waiting for regen after taking three hits in this game! The weapons feel equally awesome, from your trusty and versatile katana to the classic rocket launcher, they all feel like they pack a nice punch and give good feedback when used.\nThe weapons also include a very nice upgrade system that does a lot more than just add more damage or ammo to your clip. Want your shotgun to have 4 barrels? How about upgrading your rocket launcher to fire three rockets at once, or a crossbow with explosive bolts? Done, done and done!\n\nOn top of your equipment, you will obtain passive and active skills to further customize your experience. The skills are a lifesaver in the more intense areas of the game, with the ability to heal on the fly, or knockback a group of enemies; and the passive abilities such as more health or improved critical rate help you to feel progressively stronger as the game gets tougher.\n\nAt the end of the day, Shadow Warrior scratches that itch of being powerful in an FPS while fighting equally powerful enemies. You won’t be taking cover, you won’t be playing wack-a-mole with enemies who are also in cover, and I wouldn’t want this game to play any other way!\n","January 11, 2014","true","34.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The main character is ridiculous and if you like corny jokes turn up your speaker and listen to some classic Wang huehuehuehue type jokes.\n\nThe game works as so. It's a first person smash em' up type game where your main weapon of choice will be your sword and as well as guns that are acquired throughout the game (launchers, pistols, machine guns, crossbows, demon heads you know the usual). The game play is addicting to those who like mindless violence and like seeing how well they are rated on their violent tendencies. There are three type of upgrade categories : one which uses money to upgrade physical weapons (dual pistols, dual machine guns, crossbow tips with explosive bolts, mini nukes as your rocket launcher), the second which uses ki to upgrade luck and mental factors of the protagonist, and the third which uses karma to upgrade sword abilities or stamina. Thanks to this upgrade system the mindless violence isn't so mindless as you actually have to use your mind to think which perks would actually benefit you. Enemies vary in shapes and sizes (small and big demons) but are all kill-able. Sometimes it's annoying as heck as some parts can become quite hard, but there's always a way to win.\n\nThe graphics are as best as they come. They do not hinder, stall, or skip in any way. Cinematics are just as good. Don't expect any graphical errors here unless you have a problem with your computer.\n\nWhat happens after your done this game though? Well not much. You can run through it again but I had my fun with it and my friends are now enjoying it off my library. It was a fun game nothing against it, just wish I had more reason to go back to it.\n\n\nI may get some heat for my rating but even though this is a good and recommended game, I feel it's a honest rating :\n\n7.5/10\n\n\nFYI - I got this game on sale.","November 14, 2014","true","12.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlamesSuperior/recommended/233130/","FlamesSuperior","UpInFlames","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlamesSuperior/","263 products in account","Shadow Warrior is a modern reboot of a 3D Realms 1997 classic of the same name by Polish developer Flying Wild Hog which was founded by former employees of People Can Fly, creators of Painkiller. Shadow Warrior is set in modern day Japan and tells a rather convoluted story about a demon invasion. The players assume the role of assassin Lo Wang who works for a powerful Japanese industrial magnate Orochi Zilla who is tasked with retrieving a legendary katana called Nobitsura Kage. Things start to go very wrong very soon and Wang will have to fight his way through hordes of hired assassins and demons.\n\nThe storytelling is mostly a miss because the game can’t decide whether it wants to be a parody or not. Lo Wang himself is a walking parody who will make fun of familiar gaming tropes, but on the other hand you have these prolonged and wholly uninteresting cutscenes about some demon family and their issues. It’s an awkward mish-mash that just doesn’t work and the writing is pretty weak in both cases. The serious story is just boring and while the jokes will make you chuckle here and there, they will also sometimes fall flat.\n\nThe real reason to play this game is its setting and gameplay, both of which make Shadow Warrior stand out from most modern action games. The graphics are colorful and vibrant, the wonderful game world makes both the combat and the exploration a joy. You start off with an ordinary katana and a pistol, but you will acquire more and more weapons as you go along and you get to keep them all, there’s no weapon limit here. All weapons can be upgraded not only to become more powerful, but also to gain an alternate firing mode which is usually just completely over the top. For example, you can upgrade your two-barrel shotgun to a four-barrel shotgun and the alternate firing mode will enable shooting all four barrels at the same time resulting in complete carnage.\n\nWhile the shooting is great and wholly satisfying, the best part of the combat is slicing up your enemies with your trusted katana. You will have the opportunity to unlock a wide variety of different moves which will make the combat even more visceral and exhilarating. You’ll actually do pretty well just by button mashing, but if you want to get a better performance score and additional karma points, then you will have to use these special moves. They’re actually rewarding to use in and of themselves because they just make you feel like a total badass. And that is something that Shadow Warrior does extremely well.\n\nShadow Warrior provides a nice selection of different enemies ranging from hired assassins, low level demons to bigger and badder demons and huge bosses. The bosses actually don’t represent the highlight as they use the tried and true expose-and-hit-weakpoint type of design. They’re pretty good, but the best part is fighting droves of different enemies in big environments where you have melee enemies charging at you, ranged enemies throwing fireballs at you and flying enemies wreaking havoc from overhead. Managing these huge battles is just incredibly exciting and trying out all the different moves and weapons that are at your disposal is just unbelievably satisfying. The combat system is simply excellent.\n\nI found the pacing to be awesome. The game doesn’t constantly drown you in enemies which I often tend to find exhausting. After you clear an area, you are free to explore it and there’s a reason to do so as the world is littered not only with necessities such as health and ammo, but also secrets and easter eggs. However, if you’re only in it for the combat, you can just head on forward and you will be fighting non-stop. The game world is not consistently delightful, about halfway through you will have to trudge through several brown and bleak sewers, shipyards and some sort of a science facility. However, the design and the combat remain strong throughout making this a relatively minor gripe. Shadow Warrior is also quite a lengthy game, unlike most modern action and FPS games, it took me 16 hours to finish it on the normal difficulty setting.\n\nFlying Wild Hog simply understand action game design and Shadow Warrior is a truly great action game with a fantastic and visceral melee combat system, satisfying shooting mechanics and a wonderful game world.\n\n8 OUT OF 10 (GREAT)","January 16, 2014","true","16.3"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/StarCraftZergling/recommended/233130/","StarCraftZergling","StarCraftZerg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/StarCraftZergling/","102 products in account","I must say, this game was pretty unique when it came to gameplay. At least to ME it was. Shadow Warrior is definitely a game that keeps you playing and can be a lot of fun! After about 3-5 hours though, the game can get pretty repetitive and boring, but once it jumps off the train, it jumps right back on for some more fun and ♥♥♥-kicking!\n\nIt took me a good 10-15 hours to beat this game, and I wouldn't call it "holy grounds" but I definitely give it a thumbs up 4x. Now, some people may come to the conclusion that I just gave this game a 4/5 or a 4/10. Both of which are WRONG. The game starts with Lo Wang, protaganist with a clearly phallic name and almost blatantly racist background, walking up to an even more blatantly racist background while making a joke at it's expense.\n("Hmm, I was expecting a more cliche setting, but I guess Koy ponds and Cherry Blossoms will have to do.")\nThen Wang procedes into the huge dojo filled with momentos and valuables that serve no purpose but to brighten the atmosphere. Then he walks into a room where he meets a man who has a pretty cool sword that Wang's master, Zilla wants for his sword fetish (Or so it seems...), and Lo Wang will stop at nothing to get it for him. Only to have his plans thwarted by a demon pest named "Hoji" who ends up killing the man and taking his sword, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Zilla off in a Skype conference call. Long story short, stuff happens... blah blah blah... very important storyline... blah blah... Sword hacky slashy... blah... Boss battles... blah... explosive weapons... blah. That's pretty much the storyline!\n\nWell, aside from all of that, the game has quite a few Boss battles like the original Shadow Warrior (1996) had, and many secrets that also pay respects to the classic game like pixelated babes showering and pixelated secret rooms, that resemble certain areas from the original game. This game is in NO WAY a remake of the old one, it's a reboot. It takes Lo Wang and makes him more serious than funny, but it's not TOO serious, he's still able to crack a few unnecessary jokes now and then, but not like the original where everything was a ♥♥♥♥ing joke. But all jokes aside, the Story telling is very deep, the atmosphere is warm to the touch (great), and the gun play is fun and funny! The voice acting... Eh, not up to par with most games, but it still gives you a feeling that you're there.\n\nThe game includes Single Player and Survival modes. None of which incorporate multiplayer into them. This a 1 player game, and this was the big downer for me. After you beat the game, the replay value is there, but it's not very fun to go through again without a friend to enjoy it with you. The game is worth the buy, but not the $40 price tag. Wait for a sale and THEN get it.\n\nOVERALL: I'd say this game is a 4/5. HA HA! You thought I wasn't hinting at the final verdict, but I was! I got you sucker! Anyway, the storyline for Shadow Warrior was an enjoyable one and it made me want to beat it. The guns made for excellent hack/slash or bullet riddling fun and the explosives was just the icing on the cake! Voice acting could have been better, but it doesn't kill the score. What DOES is the lack of multiplayer. This game feels like it needed a multiplayer mode like Co-op or maybe a Deathmatch mode and that would've probably given this game a 4.5/5 or even a perfect score in my book. This is my opinion on the game. Some opinions may vary, but this is why I like Shadow Warrior.

If lots of blood is not your thing, then you should probably avoid this title. That aside, Shadow Warrior ticks many boxes and has impressed me. First of all is the story. While many FPS games do not necessarily require a good story in order to give you some enemies to shoot or melee for a few hours, Shadow Warrior includes a very nice campaign, with some quite memorable characters and dialogue fleshing out the surprisingly high quality plot. With your protagonist named Lo Wang, one should expect some crude humour, and Flying Wild Hog do not disappoint. The cutscenes are also very nice,while also giving you the option to skip them if you so desire.\n\nThe art style, particularly the basic enemies you fight, may look a little... crude? That's fine though, the dismemberment or other assorted violence will soon put that out of your mind. But the graphics of this game are quite brilliant, and the environments are truly spectacular - be they urban, forest, or snow. This also extends to the design of the weapons, which you can get a close up view of when you upgrade them with in-game cash you can find scattered all over the various levels. With a large variety, all of which you can carry at the same time if you are up to that point of the story, the weapons all look incredibly interesting, and play well too - bonuses for the visible changes in the weapons as you upgrade them, be it a laser pointer, or a larger tank, or the ability to fire multiple missiles at the same time...\n\nThe levels all look impressive, and are very vast, although they are essentially linear. Not all of the secrets are incredibly well hidden, but they can be challenging to find them all. And the nod back to the original game and other old-school shooters in the form of secret retro areas is a very nice touch. Especially when Lo Wang breaks the fourth wall. One of the few complaints I have with this game is that the large nature of the maps means that sometimes you will be forced to double back, and sometimes it can become quite difficult to find out where you actually have to go to progress.\n\nThat said, where this game truly shines is in the combat. Visceral, brutal, and with a variety of enemies to keep you on your toes, from standard humans with weapons, to demons with claws, wings, enemies who can teleport or turn invisible, to mention nothing of the mini-bosses or bosses in the game. This is not a truly realistic game, where cover is irrelevant, and you can tank damage by just healing it up again with one of your abilities, but it's fine and fun because you can just smash face first into enemies.\n\nThe game revolves around finding a legendary katana, and so swordplay is a central point of the game, with skills to improve your character and the ability to hack and slash quite satisfying - dismemberment and decapitations galore. The ability to acquire both skills and other passive bonuses, as well as upgrading your weapons also gets a tick. The guns are also quite special, from more standard revolver and shotgun to the more esoteric quad-barrel shotgun and crossbow, each with 3 upgrades, and the ability to purchase extra ammo if you're in a pinch. This is complemented by the completely insane, but incredibly fun possibilities of using demon parts as one of your demon extermination tools...\n\nEDIT: The other problem I've found with this game is the boss fights: they become quite repetitive, and the same strategy is used to beat all 3. In addition, some of the "mini-bosses", especially the Berserker, can be annoying and time consuming to kill.\n\nHuge fun, with good replayability too. +1 recommendation.","August 6, 2014","true","27.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","2"

The game never deviates from its initial path: the same 'wang' jokes are told time and again, the new jokes err more on the side of cringe-worthy instead of funny. The cool weapons become underpowered as the game starts to pile more and more fatties at you at any single point in time. The level design is dreadfully uninspired and boring. You run from point to point triggering the game's setpieces in order to spawn the various over-used enemies which the game throws at you in every chapter. In between the points, you will almost never find any enemies lurking or patrolling. The katana is the game's saving point, severing limbs and decapitating heads never gets old. However, the hit boxes for the larger sized enemies are a little wonky, so you might find yourself supposedly slashing at the back of the bugger, only to be disappointed that none of the hits registered.\n\nFinal rating: 4/10\n\n","January 8, 2015","false","8.4"," 52 of 95 people (55%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","55","52","95","5","0"

I played very little of the original Shadow Warrior, but it is basically an asian duke-nukem. Maze like level layouts, funny one liners, puzzles, culture references, all that sorta ♥♥♥♥. Now the reboot here is a lot different. The levels are less maze like and more straight forward, like newer fps games. There is some backtracking once and awhile, but in my opinion I didn't mind it. You can carry all of the guns you get and there are secrets and you fight hordes of enemies, no cover shooting at all. Health packs and everything too. Some minor character elements are still there but with a lot that was added to it. There is still some funny one liners and such, dont worry. Also they added a good story with good writing. Now the first part to cover is the gameplay.\n\nThe gameplay consists of navigating Japenese inspired levels, doing small objects, and shooting and slicing up hordes of enemies. You have your health and stamina bar. Sprinting and a sort of ninja/dodge/dash with a press of the shift key and either (w a s d). The main focus in this game is the melee combat, which is amazing. A mix of light and heavy attacks, with double presses of either (w a s d). It is a very fluid and satisfying combat system all the way to the end. The enemies also slice up into little gibs, its cool as hell! The guns in the start are a tad underwhelming in the beginning, but it takes upgrades for those guns to make them more enjoyable. There is an upgrade system as well. One tier for powers, another for guns, and a last one for skills. The powers are a double tap (w a s d) right mouse button mechanic, for example self healing or using a force push ability. These use Ki crystals to upgrade by the way. Guns are for what you expect, upgrading your pistol, machine gun, cross bow and other guns with money. Skills are a mix of katana abilities and buffs for health, and killing demons and such, skills upgrade with karma, which you get by fighting enemies and secret karma stashes.\n\nThe graphics are also amazing in this. I am using a Nivida GeForce GTX 770 with this game, Ultra, FXAA on, and it is nice looking. From vast mountains, bamboo trees, ponds, old Japanese architecture, huge temples, and towns. Nice lighting, textures and overall design. Only thing that could have had a bit more work is the faces of the people, they look sorta bad but they work. There is also some amazing cinematics, sort of like a visual moving novel. They tie into the story with the characters in it.\n\nThe last part I want to go over is the story, its good. Its about a Japanese man named Lo Wang, a bodyguard for a corporation called Zilla Enterprises. Lo Wang is tasked to retrieve a sword called the Nobistura Kage for his boss Orochi Zilla. All hell breaks loose and the sword is taken by a demon like ghost. And demons rain all through Japan and murder everyone. You then are met with a demon entity named Hoji. Which he tells you the end of the world is because of the Nobistura Kage. There is a mix of Japanese spirit world lore in this too, and surprisingly an interesting and captivating story for a shooter like this.\n\nNow should you buy this game? Yeah, if you like hack and slash games with an old/new school fps twist with a good story. There are not very many games that are fps and have hack and slash elements: and its solid. I would even say I enjoyed this game more than a triple A title like Bioshock Infinite.","October 2, 2014","true","14.1"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","5"

It's a well-polished game with very nice graphics, good game-play, interesting combat that rewards not spamming the same technique all the time, has a really nice and emotionally involving story (that ending!), includes Easter eggs referring to the original game for nostalgia (and refers to other popular games too), and it somehow balances a line between being ludicrously cheesy (try to keep count of how many Wang puns there are, or better yet: take a drink every time there is a Wang joke!) and being somewhat self-deprecating because they know how stupid it is, but for Shadow Warrior to not have Wang jokes and over the top cliche'd settings would just not be Shadow Warrior.\n\nThis is how you breathe new life into a game franchise. Other devs should take notes on this game, because there's a lot of childhood favourites that I would like to see get this kind of treatment.\n\nEdit: I bought the special edition because I love Hotline Miami, and really it wasn't worth the extra money, even on sale. I'm not sure what I expected with that promo sword, but it's just not worth it.

If you have ever wanted to play with a sword in an fps game this is probably your best choice.\n\nI primarily enjoyed using my sword whenever possible, there are a variety of attacks you can do with it including a ranged one so you can almost always complete an entire fight with it without much trouble.   The guns are all upgrade-able with a variety of improvements and utility upgrades,  the ability to dual wield on the smg or explosive bolts for the crossbow are two of my favorites.  It has very satisfying though not overly difficult combat, that managed to keep me engaged throughout the 10 hour campaign.\n\nThe artstyle and graphics are good.  Nothing really sticks out about them besides the fact that you can slash anything that can explode with your sword and see the results.  There are enough different enemies to prevent you from feeling like you are doing the same fight over and over.  You can blow limbs or cut your enemies in half, which results in blood everywhere and is one of the most enjoyable parts of the game.\n\nThe story is coherent and entertaining, while the player cracks jokes at every opportunity he can, usually about his name.\n\nOverall I had a lot of fun with this game and would love to see more games like this.  The campaign didn't feel too long or too short, and I think it would be re-playable enough for another run.  It's very hard these days to find a satisfying fps these days, but at least we have this one.","January 19, 2015","true","12.6"," 14 of 23 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","14","23","0","0"

The combat is deliciously gorey with very intereting ways to pull off special attacks. (By the way, do not play this on a controller - keyboard and mouse is the way to go in order to pull off special moves with ease.) There are RPG elements in which you spend different points to upgrade your weapons and learn new skills. The game is over-the-top and the humor is great - in particular the banter between the two protagonists. The story was surprisingly poignant and the artwork in the cutscenes was simply beautiful. The in-game graphics are nice, but nothing too special, especially the character models which look blocky and low res. Some of the environments are quite pleasing to the eye though.

I wasn't expecting much. However, this game completely took me by surprise and it was a fantastic journey from start to finish. The combat is deliciously gorey with very intereting ways to pull off special attacks. (By the way, do not play this on a controller - keyboard and mouse is the way to go in order to pull off special moves with ease.) There are RPG elements in which you spend different points to upgrade your weapons and learn new skills. The game is over-the-top and the humor is great - in particular the banter between the two protagonists. The story was surprisingly poignant and the artwork in the cutscenes was simply beautiful. The in-game graphics are nice, but nothing too special, especially the character models which look blocky and low res. Some of the environments are quite pleasing to the eye though. In short I highly recommend this game, and do not mess with the Wang.","December 24, 2014","true","13.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Like it’s predecessor, it’s an old-school shooter, but with SW we get the added fun of melee combat. And that’s basically what SW is all about: katana mayhem. It also shares much of the mechanics and gameplay tropes of the earlier game, and that’s all to the good as well. It differs from Hard Reset in some areas, however, most notably with the variety of weapons and the more conventional upgrade system and skills tree. There’s also a stronger story, although it is a tad incoherent at times. There are some very cool cutscenes, but they’re used sparsely and never intrude but do help to flesh out the story. And there’s also plenty of amusing, deliberately cheesy, dialogue to enjoy. Graphically, SW is one of the most stunning games I’ve come across, and it also delivers some impressive physics. It’s not open world, as is de rigueur these days, but its linearity keeps the story, and the game progression, on the rails and never detracts from the fun. Hugely enjoyable and highly recommended. 4/5","May 23","true","41.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","2"

I'll admit I've never been the biggest fan of the original Shadow Warrior (Though it had some fun moments) but truly this game is barely related to the original Shadow Warrior outside of the fact that the protagonist is a wisecracking sword wielding badass named Lo Wang (Who is thankfully much, much less annoying and racist than his 90s counterpart), there's a corporation named Zilla, and it's an FPS.  I do hesitate calling it a true "Old school" shooter as I kind of take issue with modern games thinking that old school FPS games were all horde based games where you'd progress to another horde that spawns in legions before moving on.  I suppose you could call it old school in attitude though, but otherwise it's more of a modern arcadey-horde shooter in the vein of Serious Sam or Painkiller, but either way it doesn't matter - all that matters is that this game is good, gory fun.

WILL contain parentheses (a lot).\n\nWhen this came out I was furious that someone had the nerve to call a game Shadow Warrior, exactly the same as the 1997 3D Realms title (as you can probably tell from that attitude, I loved that game as a kid). As the negative emotions got weaker (and the price lower) I decided to give it a try and I have to say it does its name justice. The many references to the original game didn't feel forced (and weren't overdone), and paired with modern engine and eyecandy, it was pretty damn awesome. There were some little things mostly associated with it being a 2013 game that I didn't like (certain gameplay mechanics, but mostly a number of things too small to mention), but overall I'd give this like 9/10 if I were to use numbers.\n\nPros:\n+ Very good melee combat system. The special moves (including a ranged attack) make the sword a viable and even preferrable weapon for most of the game.\n+ Good engine. Haven't had any problems with hit detection or gamebreaking glitches.\n+ Nice aesthetics overall. I really liked the 2D cutscenes.\n+ Different sorts of environment from traditional japanese to modern industrial, topped with some surreal sky landscapes, much like the original game.\n+ Plentiful throwbacks to the original 1997 Shadow Warrior (either references or parts of SW1997 levels in secrets).\n\nCons:\n- A little too linear level design in places. A "secret" is something you find if you wander more than ten feet off the beaten path.\n- Unentertaining bosses. I only played on Normal difficulty so far so this might not be objective, but they felt not-so-challenging, it just takes forever to take them down because of the tedious weak spots.\n- Most ranged weapons felt meh. Like, I'm already used to unrealistic shotgun spread in games, but holy ♥♥♥♥, the shotgun in this has like a 90° arc spread - no point using it at any range longer than point blank.","December 1, 2014","true","19.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","6","8","3","0"

If you are a fan of FPS games like Serious Sam, Doom, Quake, Duke Nukem 3D etc... then you absolutely MUST buy this game. Sure there are several guns to choose from and plenty of mayhem to be had with demonic-like powers but the real fun IMO comes with the swordplay. The swordplay mechanics are absolutely fantastic and blast to play. There is nothing quite as satisfying as slicing a demon apart limb by limb then finishing him off with a good ol' fashioned decapitation. I could literally run through the entire game with my sword out and not feel the need to pull out a gun. It's a blast!\n\nThe level's are very linear with a few collectibles and "secrets" scattered about along with crystals that help you upgrade your character. They were never really hard for me to find so I am sure you won't have any trouble either. There is usually a boss of some sort at the end of each level as well, they aren't all that hard and I recommend using a  machine gun or Launcher on them as to keep distance from the melee attacks. Your character also has a talent tree of sorts which you can use the Crystals to pick whichever talent upgrade you want. You can also earn and find money and ammo via boxes or kills (think Bioshock or Farcry) and use the money on upgrades for your weapons. You can save at any point as well which I encourage you to do because instant deaths can happen and it can be frustrating.\n\nI feel I also need to say something about our main character (not much but something). He is a fairly likable Asian man with cheesy one-liners ala' Duke Nukem or Serious Sam which are delivered at tense moments to lighten the mood. They made more sense in those games because those protaganists are more big burly badasses but Lo Wang is more of an assassin so it didn't really fit for me. It still is not bad to watch though.\n\nAll in all if you are a fan of Ninja's, Stupid jokes, Samurai swords or dismembering demons pick this gem up (8$ on sale sometimes!).\n\n-Casey\n","July 16, 2014","true","31.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

It is a sort of hack'n'slash / first person shooter. All the levels are way more beautiful then I thought they would be. The gameplay feels solid, the tone is serious while keeping it comedic. It has a bunch of references to the first shadow warrior that I played a bit back when I was younger such as almost naked pixel girls bathing  scattered through the land and rabbits that wont stop ****ing. They give you a lot of options to customize the game, Almost everything in the environment is intractable and can be destroyed and I have yet to find any problems or bugs other than the frame rate problem that is noted below.\n\nBefore buying this game there are some things you should note:\n1. The game somewhat makes fun of chinese culture. Not as much as the first one though.\n2. It is somewhat of a gore fest as you chop people in half with your katana.\n3. MOST IMPORTANT this game has frame rate issues. I tend to think my PC is fairly good. It can run most games at a solid 60fps and if not turning of shadows or vsync would help. But no matter what I do I cant get this game to run any higher than 30~45fps. After looking around it seems you need a somewhat beast computer to make it run smoothly due to some issue I didn't look into much.

You get a lot of the normal old-school FPS weapons (SMG, Pistol, Rocket launcher, Crossbow etc.) But they all felt very stiff. But they're not the interesting part of this gime.\n\nYou have 3 things you can upgrade, your skills, powers, and weapons. Skils are for stuf like more health, faster run speed, new katana abilities, Something that a normal person would be able to develop generally. Then there is the powers. 4 different in total. They are all executed by doing a movement key twice then right-click (Movement key twice + left click is for the katana skills). This might seem difficult at first, but it actually works really well, and gives you easy access to all your abilities. My favorite personally, was the flux. By Pressing S twice, and then right-click, you would charge up your first. When you released right-click, it would throw a long line into the ground, that would lift enemies up in the air for several seconds. Its amazing using the flux, then blowing someones head off with a shotgun.\n\nThe enemies are a bit weird though.\n\nThey're mostly Demons.\n\nNot a concept i enjoyed too much, but you find a few human enemies in some sections too. The demons all have specific abilities, and there are major and minor.\n\nThe minor are the ones you might be able to slash to pieces in one or few hits, while the major can take a while to kill.\nOf the minor demons, we have your usual run and hit you zombie. The radioactive that explode when you get near or shoot them. The shielders and the invisibles.\n\nThe shielders has to be the enemy i dreaded the most, not only do they block your attacks, they keep looking in your direction and you have to either throw them down, or hit the shield until it breaks. It can take a while and really breaks the flow of the game, when you're spinning around and killing litearlly everybody around you, except for them.\n\nOf the major enemies, there are 3: The Warlord, The Charger, and the Shaman. The major are a bit more interesting, so i'll talk about them.\n\nThe shaman will summon and resurrect nearby enemies, and just keep doing this until you kill him. After hes around halfway dead, he will create a green unbreakable barrier, and summon some skeletons that flash with green colors. After you kill the skeletons, the shield breaks and you can finish him off.\n\nThe Warlord will enrage nearby eneies (Which is, make them darker, and make them more powerful. Enemies can also be enraged if you use abilities or powers near them, even if there isin't a warlord there) He will also try to smash you, a lot. So every few seconds, he will throw a really fast red line, and if you touch it, he will pull you to him, and he will smash the ground.\n\nThe final one is the charger. Hes simple, and kind of boring to be honest. He will charge you, you evade it near a wall. He hits the wall. You slice his back a few times. Rinse and repeat. It just takes so long to kill these guys, that the fun quickly dies from fighting them.\n\nBut of all enemies, the most interesting one is the bosses. There are a total of 3 Demon bosses, and they're all amazing to fight. They're HUGE, and the shadow realm is just right-out eyecandy. They are all very Zelda-ish, and its very fun.\n\nAll in all, if you have ever played Red steel 1 or 2, and enjoyed it. Or just want to enjoy a throwback to the old FPS with a mix of very interesting sword fighting, you should pick this game up.\n\n9/10","December 11, 2013","true","14.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Blazebeak/recommended/233130/","Blazebeak","Blazebeak🍗","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Blazebeak/","260 products in account","This game is a really hard to explain... It is a sort of hack'n'slash / first person shooter. All the levels are way more beautiful then I thought they would be. The gameplay feels solid, the tone is serious while keeping it comedic. It has a bunch of references to the first shadow warrior that I played a bit back when I was younger such as almost naked pixel girls bathing  scattered through the land and rabbits that wont stop ****ing. They give you a lot of options to customize the game, Almost everything in the environment is intractable and can be destroyed and I have yet to find any problems or bugs other than the frame rate problem that is noted below.\n\nBefore buying this game there are some things you should note:\n1. The game somewhat makes fun of chinese culture. Not as much as the first one though.\n2. It is somewhat of a gore fest as you chop people in half with your katana.\n3. MOST IMPORTANT this game has frame rate issues. I tend to think my PC is fairly good. It can run most games at a solid 60fps and if not turning of shadows or vsync would help. But no matter what I do I cant get this game to run any higher than 30~45fps. After looking around it seems you need a somewhat beast computer to make it run smoothly due to some issue I didn't look into much. So if you have a Xbone or PS4 I would recommend buying it on one or the other, But if you have a good PC go for it.","December 6, 2014","true","13.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I will point out the only thing that could have made it better for me is a few additional monster types, however, the way the game is setup, you can dispose of them in many different ways and I can see where each enemy would involve a lot of animations and coding.  The enemies exhibit a good of moves that change the pace around and are very detailed, as is the whole game really.\n\nI took as many screenshots in this game as I did with games like STALKER and METRO because I was just in awe.  It also features a very unique to FPS system of being able to upgrade your weapons as well as passive and active abilities and sword attacks that all have there own relation to dispatching various enemies.  The story is fun but features a great skip scene option for those of us that don't wish to watch it all.\n\nThe developers put their heart and soul into this game, it is fun, exciting, beautiful and unique.

The combat system is great and fast paced with lots of combos and different skills/abilities to use (including different powers, perks and badass wep attachments :) ).  Melee combat/swordplay is extremely rewarding and brutal so that slicing through tons of enemies feels very good indeed.\n\nThere are lots of guns to use aswell, which mainly have a fairly nice gunfeel, but could be improved at some parts.  The game's combat mechanics are great and diverse, including the Ki system that is a bit familiar to Bioshock's Plasmid and Vigor systems. I would also recommend trying macros with this game:).\n\nAt the top of all, the game also looks very nice and has nice music, good humor (yet a bit sexist at some points) and a suprisingly well written story.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MetalHand/recommended/233130/","MetalHand","The Spirit of Communism","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MetalHand/","312 products in account","A incredible fun game, with a lot of focus on Sword fighting and just gernerally murdering stuff.\nYou get a Katana as your first weapon, and i personally found it to be the most fun to use. You get a lot of the normal old-school FPS weapons (SMG, Pistol, Rocket launcher, Crossbow etc.) But they all felt very stiff. But they're not the interesting part of this gime.\n\nYou have 3 things you can upgrade, your skills, powers, and weapons. Skils are for stuf like more health, faster run speed, new katana abilities, Something that a normal person would be able to develop generally. Then there is the powers. 4 different in total. They are all executed by doing a movement key twice then right-click (Movement key twice + left click is for the katana skills). This might seem difficult at first, but it actually works really well, and gives you easy access to all your abilities. My favorite personally, was the flux. By Pressing S twice, and then right-click, you would charge up your first. When you released right-click, it would throw a long line into the ground, that would lift enemies up in the air for several seconds. Its amazing using the flux, then blowing someones head off with a shotgun.\n\nThe enemies are a bit weird though.\n\nThey're mostly Demons.\n\nNot a concept i enjoyed too much, but you find a few human enemies in some sections too. The demons all have specific abilities, and there are major and minor.\n\nThe minor are the ones you might be able to slash to pieces in one or few hits, while the major can take a while to kill.\nOf the minor demons, we have your usual run and hit you zombie. The radioactive that explode when you get near or shoot them. The shielders and the invisibles.\n\nThe shielders has to be the enemy i dreaded the most, not only do they block your attacks, they keep looking in your direction and you have to either throw them down, or hit the shield until it breaks. It can take a while and really breaks the flow of the game, when you're spinning around and killing litearlly everybody around you, except for them.\n\nOf the major enemies, there are 3: The Warlord, The Charger, and the Shaman. The major are a bit more interesting, so i'll talk about them.\n\nThe shaman will summon and resurrect nearby enemies, and just keep doing this until you kill him. After hes around halfway dead, he will create a green unbreakable barrier, and summon some skeletons that flash with green colors. After you kill the skeletons, the shield breaks and you can finish him off.\n\nThe Warlord will enrage nearby eneies (Which is, make them darker, and make them more powerful. Enemies can also be enraged if you use abilities or powers near them, even if there isin't a warlord there) He will also try to smash you, a lot. So every few seconds, he will throw a really fast red line, and if you touch it, he will pull you to him, and he will smash the ground.\n\nThe final one is the charger. Hes simple, and kind of boring to be honest. He will charge you, you evade it near a wall. He hits the wall. You slice his back a few times. Rinse and repeat. It just takes so long to kill these guys, that the fun quickly dies from fighting them.\n\nBut of all enemies, the most interesting one is the bosses. There are a total of 3 Demon bosses, and they're all amazing to fight. They're HUGE, and the shadow realm is just right-out eyecandy. They are all very Zelda-ish, and its very fun.\n\nAll in all, if you have ever played Red steel 1 or 2, and enjoyed it. Or just want to enjoy a throwback to the old FPS with a mix of very interesting sword fighting, you should pick this game up.\n\n9/10","December 11, 2013","true","14.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Original released in 1997. I have not played the original so I will not be compared. But I will try to say something about the new version. You can see similar arrangement as in HR. Sprint, fight,bosses and different functions weapons. However, in my opinion, HR is a better game from Flying Wild Hog. But let's get to the meat. The graphics are good but uneven. Picturesque locations delight the eye and not once can admire the work of graphic designers. But up close the graphics are not so great. No less is fine. I don't play on highest graphics settings. Gameplay is good and fight with katana is very good. To bring a special need such a blow, press 2x W and LMB. When it is mastered can make fun. However, a larger number of different enemies will be easier to use other weapons. At least to me it was easier. Weapons are many but some are not very effective and the feeling of shooting in some of the less impressive. Unfortunately, sometimes the game is frustrating. For me it was for this that some of the levels and enemies were poorly designed.  Level of exploding enemies is terribly weak. A fight with the boss very easy and unsatisfying. The music is atmospheric and the sounds of enemies and weapons are at a good level. The game is not really in my style (kung fu) but I have fun. The story and the main character are fine although his statements are not as funny as Serious Sam or Duke Nukem. Sometimes they are childish and not funny. The game has a lot of easter eggs and funny moments like Fortune cookies. Some jokes can be understood only did the Poles because the Polish game studio. But it should not be a big problem for other players. The game also has a survival mode but only single so it's a big minus, and does not have a multiplayer mode. In summary. The game is good and I recommend you buy it at some sales.

It's amazing how devs managed to balance these two styles. It's up to you what weapon you wanna use (against normal and "stronger" demons), every weapon is useful from start to the end. You can either cut your way through using some katana combos or you can just run with guns blazing (oh god and the shotgun,,, THE SHOTGUN!)\n\nHowever! The combat is just half of the game, the other half is humour. Except for Deadpool I dont really remember any other game that made me laugh so hard. The fortune cookies are just priceless (so be sure to look for them).\n\n\nSurprisingly enough the story wasn't bad at all, it's definitely not the best story that you can find in video games but it's somewhat interesting and the cutscenes (animations) are pretty well done.\n\nHowever just like any other game even SW isn't perfect, and there is one thing that I don't like. And that's the way how they dealt with boss fights. Boss fights are rather boring, repetitive and imo not really challenging (not as much as they should be) There was definitely a better way how to do it. Fortunately boss fights aren't that common. (explained what exactly bothers me in spoiler)\nI'm not fan of fights in which you are pretty much limited to use only certain weapons and wait/keep hitting certain place on your enemy for the one moment during which you can actually harm the boss. and especialy the final boss.... after circa 11hours of extreme fun I had to fight one of the most boring fights ever.\n\nAnyway, boss fights aren't enough to ruin this game for me, it's 10/10 game for a great price (especially if you get it on sale ofc). For about 4€ I got 12 hours of story line and I'm about to play through it again (higher difficulty and achievement hunt)\n\n10/10\nLooking forward to SW2 with coop\n(ps. played original SW as well and this one definitely didn't ruin it's reputation)","June 19, 2015","true","14.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

This game brings back the classic fps feeling, it's like Duke Nukem meets Ninja Gaiden. It has a dark and serious story but a humorous protagonist who doesn't take too much seriously.\n\nI spend most of the time using the katana because of how good cutting feel. Guns aren't very powerful before you upgrade them, but it adds more fun to the game, you feel like you're progressing all the time like a true martial art student. You also unlock many abilities, one for katana moves and one for ki powers.\n\nThis game is full of secret areas like good old Doom-likes and many of those are areas from the original Shadow Warrior bringing pure nostalgia. They are also very rewarding, giving you karma and money. I have so much fun looking for secrets and references that I often forget the main path.\n\nAt the end of a level there is a screen showing you how many secrets you found, how many enemies you killed and how much karma you gained and could have gained. This is something that was in a lot of Doom-likes that would bring a lot of replayability. There is also a survival mode that can be fun once you finish the game, and the ability to replay the game with all your weapons and powers.\n\nIf you're tired of rushed and overhyped modern fps aimed toward casuals and want to feel like you're playing a classic fps again, this game is for you.","August 14, 2015","true","17.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

In this review I will describe how it holds up in comparison and try to cut right to the chase.\n\nThe level design isn't quite as open and doesn't offer as many secrets as the original, but you can tell that Flying Wild Hog put a lot of love and work into this project. The combat is extremely fun and satisfying, especially the different katana moves. The weapons are varied, fun to use and none of them feel unneccessary or even useless. The story is fairly cheesy, so I guess you could say they nailed this aspect. Shadow Warrior and a serious story don't mix as far as I'm concerned. The voice acting is great, even though I miss Lo Wang's original voice. The quips are hit and miss, but overall quite funny. What really impresses me about this game is that it feels like an almost perfect blend of "retro" and modern game design. Many developers have aspired to do that and most of them failed. Flying Wild Hog managed to pull it off, which deserves much respect.\n\nI've spent about 21 hours on Shadow Warrior and enjoyed it a lot. I'm planning to replay it at some point.\n\nBottom line: If you aren't offended by strong video game violence and dark, sometimes childish humor, you will have a great time with this game!","December 22, 2014","true","21.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The game looked absolutely fantastic! And, at first, it was. At first, the level design was good, the enemies got harder over time, and there were variations of them. But after awhile...the level design goes downhill. Also, they don't put many different enemies in the game after chapter...7 I want to say. Also I'd like to add that the bosses are extremely simple. First, you shoot off their armor pieces, they go down, you destroy their crystals, etc, etc. This is for every. Single. Boss.\n\nIt just seems like the game is completely awesome for a good 2 hours, then Flying Hog just kind of...ran out of ideas? I'm not sure what happened. Another thing is that the game is about 10 hours long (I played on normal difficulty), and really doesn't have any replay value. There's no extras. Finally, the skills and the powers and things. Lots of them are just plain useless, and you won't ever use them. Maybe it was because I was playing on normal mode, but still, I felt like if I didn't spend most of the power-up points I got, then I'd be okay and could keep playing the game.\n\nNow on to the good things. The sword mechanics are actually very good! You can even set it to an advanced mode in options to make the sword swing to where you move your mouse. Slicing up enemies is VERY satisfying. Also dual uzis is pretty much epic in my book. Firing 3 rockets at once while using a laser to determine where they'll hit? Play Shadow Warrior. Like to use a flamethrower WITH a GRENADE LAUNCHER attached?? Play Shadow Warrior. Like to behead six demons at once with a katana??!? Play Shadow Warrior.\n\nDespite some of the bad things, this game is fun. It's a good game. Not great, but good. I'll definitely recommend this game, but try to get it on sale.","April 22, 2014","true","10.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JPrice321/recommended/233130/","JPrice321","JPrice","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JPrice321/","323 products in account","There's been quite a number of reboots to classic FPS franchises in recent years. However most of them have turned out to be ultimately dissapointing, with Duke Nukem Forever being overall a shoddy experience and Rise of the Triad bringing a full old school experience but also including numerous design faults. So next up on the list is Shadow Warrior.\n\nYou play as Lo Wang, who aside from being a walking ♥♥♥♥ joke has been sent to retreve a sword from an organisation by any means necessary. This inevitably doesn't go smoothly and thus there are demons all across the land, the rest of the game from then on is a quest for this mystical sword called the Nobitsura Kage. The plot itself is fairly standard affair for a game of this sort, never really reaching beyond decent. There are also some issues regarding the stories tone although it’s not too huge an issue. Although story qualms are a minor issue it doesn't detract from the game when looking at the main reason that one would play it, the gameplay.\n\nGameplay is the make or break aspect of these throwback FPS's. Thankfully what we're given is a vicious thrill ride that entertains all throughout its playtime. One of the more interesting aspects to the original Shadow Warrior was that you could use a sword as a melee weapon, the reboot takes this side weapon and makes it the forefront of the game which turns out to be the best decision they could have made. The sword play in Shadow Warrior is simply one of the best melee systems that's been put into any game. You'll be in giggly fits of glee slicing through the demon horde in Shadow Warrior as each slice carves through enemies like butter. Limbs flying everywhere, heads lopped off and all done with an over the top gorey attitude. What makes the sword even better is that it's always a valid option, even until the final fights. However there are also an array of traditional guns like a revolver, machine gun and rocket launcher. Whilst these weapons aren't as fun to use as the sword, they add some nice variety to the game and are prove to be necessary with certain enemies. Also added in the mix are special Ki abilites that allow you to pull of magical powers such as pushing enemies away or healing, add in a dodge mechanic and Shadow Warrior provides a fairly robust and entertaining set of tools to be used at your disposal on your demonic foes.\n\nHowever this could all be a repeat instance of Rise of the Triad, which had great gameplay but suffered due to poor design. Thankfully Shadow Warrior avoids most of these pitfalls but doesn't necessarily come out unscathed. For one, levels are usually fairly linear rather than a mass sprawling map to explore, also the game utilises a checkpoint system but you are able to use normal saves and quick saves anywhere you like. There are however a few issues. As with most throwback titles like this there can be issues with backtracking in that it can become easy to get lost looking for the one door to progress to the next part of the level. Also I did encounter an issue during a fight where an enemy was stuck somewhere in the level which made progression impossible, this was fixed by reloading an old save. Aside from that however the game holds up design-wise.\n\nGraphically the game actually looks really nice for the most part. Thanks to the eastern setting there is an abundance of colour and vibrancy that makes the environments pop, leaving you truely impressed with some of the images. The game does find iself being bogged down near the middle with seemingly endless ship environments but they don't last too long in retrospect and end just as it would get truely tedious. There are also some texture pop-in issues but they were few and far between.\n\nShadow Warrior is back with a bang! With its emphasis on sadisticly satisfying sword play Shadow Warrior manages to carve itself a unique indentity within the FPS genre. Those who truely appreciate and love old school FPS or melee combat in games should pick up that katana and have a bloodsoaked bash with Wang.","October 13, 2013","true","17.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

As for the other weapons: all of them are wonderfully designed with alternate firemodes each and are generally a joy to use in their own ways; after all these are some of the Painkiller devs we're talking about.\n\nFinally, the cherry on top for me would be the sense of humor and the (non-pandering) pop-culture references which really make you feel at home with everything from Star Wars to Taxi Driver.

Additionally there is one of the best katana combat systems in this game. The story is not particularly amazing or deep but I personalyy didnt care because the gameplay was so fun.

Although there was one enemy type that was just a pain to deal with. It was a charger character with one vulnerable weak spot. It kept messing with the flow of the game since it would regularly be the last foe standing and take a minute or two to bring down one of them. This could take me as long as six minutes when there were four to kill. However the rest presented and ideal challenge and with lots of ways to deal with them. Ammo is pretty plentiful so if you are looking to be forced to change weapons that will not be quite the case. You will not be able to use the same weapon for the whole game since ammo drops are not that plentiful but a skilled player could mangage to use only two weapons.

The game has you take the role of Lo Wang, a sarcastic and awesome protagonist who is told by the head of Zilla Industries to retrieve an ancient sword that goes by the name "Nobitsura Kage" which is a weapon that is said to have connections with ancient Gods and possess power unlike anything mankind has ever seen. Along the way Lo Wang will meet a spirit known as "Hoji", who helps Wang on his quest to retrieve the Nobitsura Kage.\n\nThe gameplay is a mix between an old school first person shooter and a Hack-and-slash, the game starts you off with a Katana as your first weapon which is probably the best weapon in the game, with it you can slice enemie's limbs off, perform moves such as a 360 spin, power attacks and even press reload to clean your Katana from blood, which I gotta say is a pretty cool touch. As you progress in the game's 14 hour single player campaign you will gain upgrades for your katana, one being the ability to drain health from an enemy,Wang can also perform moves with the power of KI, moves include shockwaves, healing, levitation, push, etc. These moves are essential if you want to beat the game on it's higher difficulties.\n\nAlong the way you will pick up a vast array of weapons ranging from Revolvers and SMGS, to the more heavy stuff like flame throwers and a rocket launcher at some stage. You can even use a demon's head to unleash a powerful beam which totally destroys enemies and even a demon's heart to instant kill a smaller demon. Some of these weapons may seem weak at first but stick with it and you will find them extremely useful in situtations. Each weapon also has their own description on it's original use, who manufactured it, and it's history which is quite an awesome touch. Each weapon has their own upgrades in the menu which can be bought using money found in the games 18 chapters (Including the prologue), upgrades can range from more damage, a bigger clip size, explosive ammunition, and akimbo for the SMGS.\n\nSpeaking of upgrades, Lo Wang himself can be upgraded with more moves, health, KI, stamina, endurace, etc. These upgrades can be bought using Ki Crystals found within the chapters and earning KARMA, which is this game's equivalent to experience points. Then finally you have the games boss fights, which are all giant monsters whose weakpoint is the crystal behind their armour, these fights are definatly fun, but begin to grow repetitive, but are made a bit more interesting with new attack patterns and the upgrades you obtain on the way. Speaking of enemies, there is a large variety of enemies ranging from shield enemies, explosive enemies, winged enemies, golem enemies, shamen enemies and many more off the top of my head and each enemy provides a fair and balanced challenge to the player. This game is by no means an easy game, I had myself dying at certain points which made me angry, but enough to make me continue.\n\nEach Chapter is filled to the brim with med kits, ammo, money, fortune cookies, secrets, Karma pools, KI crystals, easter eggs which all make exploration a key factor in Shadow Warrior.\n\nThe graphics in this game makes this one of the most beautiful games I've ever played with stunning vistas, crisp textures, lighting, models and animation. I could sit here for days saying how beatiful this game is.\n\nThe sound design is also excellent, with well done voice acting, ambiant sounds, gun sounds, katana sounds and a superb soundtrack which help set the atmosphere.\n\nLastly, Lo wang himself is an excellent character who let's out witty and sarcastic dialouge which makes the character in my opinion very loveable and full of personality, my favourite line from him was "Where did you demons learn Kung-Fu? Kung-Fu r us?" which had me cracking up.  Hoji is probably my favourite character, he also let's out witty and sarcastic dialouge and creates hilarious banter between him and Lo wang, such as the moment when they chat about Eye of the Tiger which made me laugh pretty damn hard.\n\nShadow Warrior is no means a short game, each level can take from 25 minutes upwards to an hour and a half which resulted in a 14 hour single player, even longer if you want to find all the secrets and get perfect scores. After you beat the game you unlock Heroic and EX mode, EX is basically new game+ and Heroic has you beat each level with only 1 checkpoint at the start of each level that is apparently harder than Insane (The hardest difficulty).\n\nRECENTLY ADDED: Also, when you're done with the campiagn there is also a survival mode where you fight waves upon waves of enemies while buying upgrades along the way while trying to get on top of the leaderboards, this mode is definatly not one to be missed.\n\nAfter beating Shadow Warrior, I then took a big drink of water, then started the game all over again on Heroic I did this because Shadow Warrior 2013 is to me is a near-perfect game, and I can happily say that Shadow Warrior 2013 is by far one of my favourite games of all time, which ended on an unforgettable ending.\n\nFlying Wild Hog, I salute you, because this game, is bloody brilliant.\n\n10/10","December 13, 2013","true","25.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

That being said, the hand-drawn cutscenes and resolution of the story is engaging and emotional, despite all of the ♥♥♥♥ jokes made about the protagonist's name: Lo Wang. He goes from being an arrogant ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to a respectable hero, and it makes for a pretty decent story. It's longer than Hard Reset and of the same caliber: outstanding and underrated, especially considering what it is.

Knowing this was going to be developed by a company like Flying Wild Hog, i had high hopes. Didn't pick it up at release, but boy does it deserve the full price tag. Shadow Warrior is probably the most enjoyable single player FPS i've played in a long time (Bulletstorm coming close enough). I was a huge fan of the original Shadow Warrior from 1997, so playing this one felt like home sweet home.\n\nIt has the classic humour and the swordsplay is a pleasent surprise and loads of fun (compared to the basic swordsplay back in the day). All the upgrades seem interesting too and add a lot to the game to keep it interesting. Combat with the weapons is fun, but i always find myself going back to the katana easily. The Soundtrack gives the game a great athmosphere and keeps giving great amount of goosebumps during the battles, making them seem epic every time you get in trouble with the demons, great work in that aspect as well.\n\nAll in all, i recommend this to anybody who likes/liked Bulletstorm, Serious Sam series and the like, or even for old timers who grew up with the original SW, Quake, Blood, Duke Nukem and so forth. Pure mindless FPS fun that keeps you smiling and laughing all around. Highly recommended!","January 9, 2014","true","36.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You play as Lo Wang, a sword and gun wielding one-liner machine on a mission to save the world from demons.\n\nWhat sets apart Shadow Warrior from the multitude of other FPS games is the swordplay. While the gunplay is not the most exciting you will see in the genre, with the guns not feeling powerful enough, the swords are really second to none. There are many special moves, each with their own uses, and there is a great sense of satisfaction to be felt as you see limbs and heads fly off your enemies. The best approach is probably to mix up the two weapons, but the more fun approach may be swords only.\n\nThe graphics are ok if not spectacular for their time. There was recently a new graphics overhaul released for free, but I did not notice much of a difference. Maybe this is due to the graphics being a little forgettable in the first place.\n\nThe story and writing is ridiculous and par for the course for 90's FPS games. Save the world while killing hordes and hordes of bullet sponge enemies. How Lo Wang finds time to think of his witty remarks during his genocidal spree, I may never know.\n\nThe issue I found with Shadow Warrior is that it all starts feeling a little samey after a few levels. I kind of lost my will to continue shooting and chopping up demons after about 4 hours. I wouldn't say that makes the game a failure, just that I got my fill before it was over. The story is definitely secondary to the gameplay, which I enjoyed, but I really had no wish to see the game the whole way through. Overall I felt like I got my money's worth out of the game, but I got it on sale. Would I be happy if I paid $40, probably not. I couldn't recommend it at that price. But is it worth a play if you find it on sale? Absolutely.\n\nGrade: B","April 8, 2015","true","4.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game manages to stay true to the original's gameplay and others of its era while adding a pletheral of new ideas on top of the mix, Sword play is tight and responsive with a good feeling of "Man I cut that dude to peices" and honestly, you could probably make a game on it alone. The other weapons in the game are varied, down to your revolver all the way up to your rocket launcher and cross bow gun. Though they seem bland at first when you get them you can spend cash you find around to give them that extra "Fu*k Yeah" moments and power. Surprisingly the story is actualy not bad at all and will have you gripped into it, the story cutscenes done in a comic book moving art way that reminds me of Samurai Jack and old cartoons. The game never gives up its fast paced gameplay, you'll be dashing and trashing things left and right as the beautifull enviroment gets destroy to peices as everything around you explodes in an ungodly fu*king firestorm of death and destuction.\n\nIt also comes up a nice survival mode that allows you to build up your upgrades slowly as you're pitted against the odds taking over the single player into an even faster paced tight enviroment arena.\n\nLo and his demon buddy actualy have some pretty nice dialogue since they are both kinda di*ks, so its kinda fun to watch them have at each other. And yes Lo Wang's one liners are dumb but give you that smile you need, that stupid smile.\n\nThe game also has many secrets and nods to the old game and a few to Duke Nukem.\n\nThe boss fights are massive and monolithic and are great the first time around, how ever this is my only real complaint, the boss fights drag on abit and have the weak point gimmick which grinds it out furtherm playing on a harder dificulty will realy suck against them.\n\nThe campaign is roughly 10+ hours.\n\nAll in all I suggest anyone who likes old school with some new ideas to pick this up, THIS IS HOW YOU DO A REBOOT OR JUST BRING BACK OLD SCHOOL GAMING. *cough* Duke Nukem Forever, Doom 3 *cough*","May 28, 2014","true","30.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It has the good old-school feeling to it. Whether you wield a katana to chop some meat to bloody pieces or just like to shoot baddies from far - it all will feel very intense and satisfying. I really like the presence of alternative modes for shooting weapons. It's something that I missed in shooters long time (screw you, "Press RMB to aim"! Hail to the "Press RMB to kick ♥♥♥!").\n+ You have 4 magic abilities and 4 sword powers. Those are activated by tapping the movement key twice and pressing LMB or RMB (you can use magic while wielding shooting weapons too). If it doesn't work well for you, you can make timing adjusments in settings, which is nice.\n+ Enemies are well varied and have their own strengths and weaknesses. If you use your magic abilities too much, they will become more and more enraged and will attack more swiftly and painfully.\n+ The plot is surprisingly good. The dialogues are well-written and characters are likeable. There's a lot of funny lines.\n+ Secrets! Lots of secrets and easter eggs! Something that I've missed a lot too!\n+ My personal favorite - a lot of interactive, destructable, physical objects (comma before 'physical' is intentional). In latest games I literally HATED the lack of physics, most objects being static pieces of environment (even in action games! that's absurd!). In this game, however, you can let your inner redneck out and smash vases, break tables, ruin the furniture, etc. A decent room may become a total mess after a good fight... or after some fooling around. I loooooove to break stuff.\n\nThere are also some downsides though, but nothing big:\n- Bosses are very similar in terms of fighting them. You just need to shoot the shiny parts of their armor and then destroy the uncovered crystals. Normal enemies make more challenge at some points.\n- A lot of using the "This door is magically sealed! Go destroy 3 statues that are holding the seal!" method. It gives some depth to levels and makes them more varied-less linear (because you have to go search for those statues), but to the game's end it become quite annoying.\n- Players with not powerful enough computers may experience sluggishness and low framerate. I've made it through the whole game on max settings and never had a problem (and my system is not a high-end one), but I saw people complaining on forums, so I think this should be stated here. But you know, people always complain. If your system is good, the game should run just fine.\n\nThat's all, I guess. I adore this game. An intense, fun, sort of nostalgic experience. If you love lots of blood and gore, if you like good humor, if your eyes are used to nice graphics, if you miss the good old days when shooters were clever and challenging - this game brings it all.","February 15, 2014","true","15.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I haven't played anything like this in a while, something that I can just sink into and have tons of fun in. This game's combat is really different than most modern day FPSs(though most of the time it's hard to call this game a shooter). The game's combat is much more like old shooters, where instead of hiding behind walls , you're running around as fast as you can blowing enemies to bits. Although there's one key difference, you're not blowing them to bits....you're slicing them to bits! And that's where this game gets interesting, your primary weapon is a samurai sword that you'll have fun running around and swinging through demons for hours. The gameplay of Shadow Warrior is great, fast paced, fun sword action, and some ancient ninja magic to spice things up. However, for some reason you can also use guns. The guns seem really out of place, the shooting isn't that great, but thankfully you don't have to use them all that often excpet for....bosses. Bosses are one of the biggest complaint of the gameplay.  For some reason in this awsome game about using a sweet sword you have to switch to guns for these guys. The bosses are tedious, unfun, and really slow down the pacing. There aren't a lot of bosses though, and there is plenty of fun sword action between them.\n\nThis game looks fantastic. It is mostly set in Japan, and they really use that to their advantage. Almost everything is styled  in kind of a traditional Japanese designwith cherry blossoms and shrines, it all looks great.\n\nOverall this game is a definative 'play it!' The combat is super fun and I kept telling myself 'just one more level' every time I needed to go. You'll have tons of fun hacking up demons in a beautiful Japanese environment.\n\n","December 8, 2013","true","12.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game has you take the role of Lo Wang, a sarcastic and awesome protagonist who is told by the head of Zilla Industries to retrieve an ancient sword that goes by the name "Nobitsura Kage" which is a weapon that is said to have connections with ancient Gods and possess power unlike anything mankind has ever seen. Along the way Lo Wang will meet a spirit known as "Hoji", who helps Wang on his quest to retrieve the Nobitsura Kage.\n\nThe gameplay is a mix between an old school first person shooter and a Hack-and-slash, the game starts you off with a Katana as your first weapon which is probably the best weapon in the game, with it you can slice enemie's limbs off, perform moves such as a 360 spin, power attacks and even press reload to clean your Katana from blood, which I gotta say is a pretty cool touch. As you progress in the game's 14 hour single player campaign you will gain upgrades for your katana, one being the ability to drain health from an enemy,Wang can also perform moves with the power of KI, moves include shockwaves, healing, levitation, push, etc. These moves are essential if you want to beat the game on it's higher difficulties.\n\nAlong the way you will pick up a vast array of weapons ranging from Revolvers and SMGS, to the more heavy stuff like flame throwers and a rocket launcher at some stage. You can even use a demon's head to unleash a powerful beam which totally destroys enemies and even a demon's heart to instant kill a smaller demon. Some of these weapons may seem weak at first but stick with it and you will find them extremely useful in situtations. Each weapon also has their own description on it's original use, who manufactured it, and it's history which is quite an awesome touch. Each weapon has their own upgrades in the menu which can be bought using money found in the games 18 chapters (Including the prologue), upgrades can range from more damage, a bigger clip size, explosive ammunition, and akimbo for the SMGS.\n\nSpeaking of upgrades, Lo Wang himself can be upgraded with more moves, health, KI, stamina, endurace, etc. These upgrades can be bought using Ki Crystals found within the chapters and earning KARMA, which is this game's equivalent to experience points. Then finally you have the games boss fights, which are all giant monsters whose weakpoint is the crystal behind their armour, these fights are definatly fun, but begin to grow repetitive, but are made a bit more interesting with new attack patterns and the upgrades you obtain on the way. Speaking of enemies, there is a large variety of enemies ranging from shield enemies, explosive enemies, winged enemies, golem enemies, shamen enemies and many more off the top of my head and each enemy provides a fair and balanced challenge to the player. This game is by no means an easy game, I had myself dying at certain points which made me angry, but enough to make me continue.\n\nEach Chapter is filled to the brim with med kits, ammo, money, fortune cookies, secrets, Karma pools, KI crystals, easter eggs which all make exploration a key factor in Shadow Warrior.\n\nThe graphics in this game makes this one of the most beautiful games I've ever played with stunning vistas, crisp textures, lighting, models and animation. I could sit here for days saying how beatiful this game is.\n\nThe sound design is also excellent, with well done voice acting, ambiant sounds, gun sounds, katana sounds and a superb soundtrack which help set the atmosphere.\n\nLastly, Lo wang himself is an excellent character who let's out witty and sarcastic dialouge which makes the character in my opinion very loveable and full of personality, my favourite line from him was "Where did you demons learn Kung-Fu? Kung-Fu r us?" which had me cracking up.  Hoji is probably my favourite character, he also let's out witty and sarcastic dialouge and creates hilarious banter between him and Lo wang, such as the moment when they chat about Eye of the Tiger which made me laugh pretty damn hard.\n\nShadow Warrior is no means a short game, each level can take from 25 minutes upwards to an hour and a half which resulted in a 14 hour single player, even longer if you want to find all the secrets and get perfect scores. After you beat the game you unlock Heroic and EX mode, EX is basically new game+ and Heroic has you beat each level with only 1 checkpoint at the start of each level that is apparently harder than Insane (The hardest difficulty).\n\nRECENTLY ADDED: Also, when you're done with the campiagn there is also a survival mode where you fight waves upon waves of enemies while buying upgrades along the way while trying to get on top of the leaderboards, this mode is definatly not one to be missed.\n\nAfter beating Shadow Warrior, I then took a big drink of water, then started the game all over again on Heroic I did this because Shadow Warrior 2013 is to me is a near-perfect game, and I can happily say that Shadow Warrior 2013 is by far one of my favourite games of all time, which ended on an unforgettable ending.\n\nFlying Wild Hog, I salute you, because this game, is bloody brilliant.\n\n10/10","December 13, 2013","true","25.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This one was a retro-reboot inspired on the Shadow Warrior released in 1997.\n\nHere we control Lo Wang, a ninja mercenary from modern day time with excellent humor sense, we fight against demons hordes. Game is quite big, there are 17 large chapters, but linear levels with a good amount of secrets and easter eggs to discover.\n\nBesides the good humor sense that game gives us, the combat system very smooth and is very varied, you have nice combos to make, with your sword or weapons.  You get a good number of weapons added to your arsenal as you progress through the game and can carry all of them with you. The combat also has a fantastic melee element with the katana that you start the game with.\n\nWe also have a progression and upgrade system, were we can upgrade our skills and get new powers with the KI crystals. When you upgrade the powers or the skills you can move faster, regenerate health easily or get a new power to Wang use.\n\nNow the worst part of this game was definitely the gameplay, is very boring at least for me, we kill, we follow the goal that most of times is destroy a statue that is blocking a magical door and nothing else to do. Yeah we can find the easter eggs and some other secrets but still, i did expect more on this.\n\nOverall I was surprised at how good this game was. If you are a fan of old-school, fast paced FPS action with a sense of humor then I highly recommend this game.\n\n~ 7/10","April 19, 2014","true","6.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This is some of the most fun I've ever had playing an FPS game - that's what Shadow Warrior is from start to finish: pure fun.\n\nYou play as Lo Wang, an assassin sent on a seemingly menial task, until things get completely out of hand with a full blown demonic invasion. Lo Wang and the witty and insightful deuteragonist Hoji, are a delight to listen and their personalities complement each other's perfectly, constantly exchanging light hearted, hilarious quips and wisecracks, but also being serious when circumstances demand. They are a match made in heaven - or hell, in this case. You can't help but chuckle when you listen to them. The story is inspired by old Asian legends and is surprisingly good. It doesn't make much sense at first but things get tied together rather nicely towards the end.\n\nThe combat (which you'll be doing a LOT of) is extremely satisfying and gory. The hectic, always-mobile nature of the fights will keep you to the edge of your seat, especially in the endgame chaotic battles. The gradual introduction of new enemies and weapons keep things interesting. Use variety in your kills and you'll be rewarded extra Karma points, which give you access to a detailed skill tree that you can customize according to your playstyle. This encouragement to use variety lends an almost cinematic quality to some fights, reminiscent of Hong Kong cinema. There are plenty of cool weapons to select from, which can be upgraded with modifications you can buy throughout the game with such over the top options as to add a grenade launcher to your flamethrower, among others.\n\nThe levels are beautifully designed, with varying locales each gorgeous in its own right. The scenery is so nice that you can't help but think at times that you're looking at a postcard - albeit one with pools of blood and dead bodies littered about. It is not always obvious where to go and you might get lost at times, but try to get to the "glowing" door and you'll be alright. Secrets are creatively hidden, and there are references to the old Shadow Warrior and other titles scattered all over the place.\n\nLast but not least - I did not encounter a single bug during my playthrough, a tell tale sign of a very well polished game.\n\nThere are flaws however, although these are more of minor gripes than actual glaring flaws. The one that vexed me the most was that the most dangerous enemies in the entire game are the stairs. That's right: if you dash when at the top of most stairs in the game, you will plunge to your death. Lo Wang can survive being shot and slashed, but a 2 meter drop will either kill him instantly or leave his life hanging by a thread. Another thing was that the rating system at the end of each battle is unpredictable at times, giving you 2/5 stars even if you are quick, accurate, and use variety, and at other times rewarding you with 5/5 stars for no discernable reason (as far as I can tell). The loading times between levels often take quite a while as well.\n\nAll in all however, fantastic game. I really hope Flying Wild Hog makes a sequel to this.","April 8, 2014","true","43.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A mix of old school and modern tech ingrediants Flying Wild Hog knows guns and action and prove it again with their second FPS game.\n\nIn Shadow Warrior you play as Lo Wang who while on a mission to retrieve a sacred sword to destroy demons from another dimension(totally cliche) you totally get blindsided into the real story of a family tradgedy. Its actually pretty good and the ending is very bittersweet. But if you didnt come to the game for story thats ok, cutscense can be skipped at the tap of a button and the story is told in less than 5 minutes i would guess but totally worth paying attention.\n\nThe gameplay is very simple, enter an area kill everything. There is no cover and no mercy. Even after mini boss fights enemies will continue to keep coming. There is a semi generous save system in place and you can heal yourself at anytime but trust me there will be times when you question both.\n\nYou will be given your basic FPS arsenal from guns, crossbow, flamthowers and rocket launchers that are all upgradeable as well as some mystical powers and perks to choose. All the weopns and powers are useful and i never found myself sticking to one or another. Constantly cycling through weapons and powers during each battle is recommeded as each encounter is graded. The more variety the more experience you earn towards a perk upgrade.\n\nShawdow Warrior is a good looking game(2013) though most of it comes from the enviorments, and weapons. Most enemies are not that memorable and human charcters are minimal in the game and are very basic looking. A game can be strengthened by graphics and while this doesnt raise the bar it will never diminsh the actual game with age.\n\nOne of the weakest parts of the game is enemy variety. This is a long game 20+ hrs and i can name every enemy i hate i one hand. More variety would be welcome but the horde packages, enviroments and your constant upgrades helped differentiate each encounter.\n\nI also have to mention the huomor that is constantly up front and had me laughin out loud. Also, each level there is numerous secrets to be found which in itself is a game.\n\nOverall Shadow Warrior is an awesome game, maybe a bit long, a little weak with enemy variety and the last encouter and boss can be marathons but well worth getting your Wang on. A must buy for fans of horde levels, Doom, Wolfenstein, FPS type games.\n\nPositives\nTotal Bang for your Buck\nGreat setting, enviorments, music\nGood story\nWeapons, powers, skill tress\nNon Stop Action\nHumor, voice acting\n\nNegatives\nEnemy variety\nSometimes hard to figure which way to go\nOne trick pony\nMarathon Boss at the end\nA little long","June 9, 2015","true","25.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While the original is perhaps best known for distastefully racist humour and annoying sword combat, this fresh take by veteran developers Flying Wild Hog (made of People Can Fly ex-pats, of Painkiller fame) is made distinct by large combat areas and refreshingly good sword combat.\n\nIt's an arcade shooter through and through, with audacious weapons, ridiculous enemies, and too many explosions. It combines with really satisfying slice-'em-up mechanics and a sense of weight and urgency not found in lighter "retro" shooters like Rise of the Triad, a distinctly stupid plot that lends the game a purpose (and a sense of humour) beyond dispatching wave after wave of slobbering ghouls, and fantastic graphics backed up by a gorgeous art direction. It's a "best of both worlds" scenario, with the impact and fidelity of modern shooters, backed up by the cornball antics of days gone by. I think it's exactly how Shadow Warrior deserved to be reincarnated - staying true to its "old-school" roots, while knowing exactly what to jettison to make this take on the title unique, instead of merely faithful.","September 26, 2014","true","10.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's your basic run and gun shooter, where you spend most of the time fighting off hordes of enemies. I never played the original so it's nostalgia factor is lost on me. What I will say though is that there is a lot more to this game than I initially thought. The humor is great, the dialogue is quirky/snappy, and the story (while nothing of the mindblowing sort) is suprisingly decent! Some enemies do need a certain strategy to kill. And the campaign is quite lengthy, although I felt it started off a little slow.

Knowing this was going to be developed by a company like Flying Wild Hog, i had high hopes. Didn't pick it up at release, but boy does it deserve the full price tag. Shadow Warrior is probably the most enjoyable single player FPS i've played in a long time (Bulletstorm coming close enough). I was a huge fan of the original Shadow Warrior from 1997, so playing this one felt like home sweet home.\n\nIt has the classic humour and the swordsplay is a pleasent surprise and loads of fun (compared to the basic swordsplay back in the day). All the upgrades seem interesting too and add a lot to the game to keep it interesting. Combat with the weapons is fun, but i always find myself going back to the katana easily. The Soundtrack gives the game a great athmosphere and keeps giving great amount of goosebumps during the battles, making them seem epic every time you get in trouble with the demons, great work in that aspect as well.\n\nAll in all, i recommend this to anybody who likes/liked Bulletstorm, Serious Sam series and the like, or even for old timers who grew up with the original SW, Quake, Blood, Duke Nukem and so forth. Pure mindless FPS fun that keeps you smiling and laughing all around. Highly recommended!","January 9, 2014","true","36.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JPrice321/recommended/233130/","JPrice321","JPrice","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JPrice321/","323 products in account","There's been quite a number of reboots to classic FPS franchises in recent years. However most of them have turned out to be ultimately dissapointing, with Duke Nukem Forever being overall a shoddy experience and Rise of the Triad bringing a full old school experience but also including numerous design faults. So next up on the list is Shadow Warrior.\n\nYou play as Lo Wang, who aside from being a walking ♥♥♥♥ joke has been sent to retreve a sword from an organisation by any means necessary. This inevitably doesn't go smoothly and thus there are demons all across the land, the rest of the game from then on is a quest for this mystical sword called the Nobitsura Kage. The plot itself is fairly standard affair for a game of this sort, never really reaching beyond decent. There are also some issues regarding the stories tone although it’s not too huge an issue. Although story qualms are a minor issue it doesn't detract from the game when looking at the main reason that one would play it, the gameplay.\n\nGameplay is the make or break aspect of these throwback FPS's. Thankfully what we're given is a vicious thrill ride that entertains all throughout its playtime. One of the more interesting aspects to the original Shadow Warrior was that you could use a sword as a melee weapon, the reboot takes this side weapon and makes it the forefront of the game which turns out to be the best decision they could have made. The sword play in Shadow Warrior is simply one of the best melee systems that's been put into any game. You'll be in giggly fits of glee slicing through the demon horde in Shadow Warrior as each slice carves through enemies like butter. Limbs flying everywhere, heads lopped off and all done with an over the top gorey attitude. What makes the sword even better is that it's always a valid option, even until the final fights. However there are also an array of traditional guns like a revolver, machine gun and rocket launcher. Whilst these weapons aren't as fun to use as the sword, they add some nice variety to the game and are prove to be necessary with certain enemies. Also added in the mix are special Ki abilites that allow you to pull of magical powers such as pushing enemies away or healing, add in a dodge mechanic and Shadow Warrior provides a fairly robust and entertaining set of tools to be used at your disposal on your demonic foes.\n\nHowever this could all be a repeat instance of Rise of the Triad, which had great gameplay but suffered due to poor design. Thankfully Shadow Warrior avoids most of these pitfalls but doesn't necessarily come out unscathed. For one, levels are usually fairly linear rather than a mass sprawling map to explore, also the game utilises a checkpoint system but you are able to use normal saves and quick saves anywhere you like. There are however a few issues. As with most throwback titles like this there can be issues with backtracking in that it can become easy to get lost looking for the one door to progress to the next part of the level. Also I did encounter an issue during a fight where an enemy was stuck somewhere in the level which made progression impossible, this was fixed by reloading an old save. Aside from that however the game holds up design-wise.\n\nGraphically the game actually looks really nice for the most part. Thanks to the eastern setting there is an abundance of colour and vibrancy that makes the environments pop, leaving you truely impressed with some of the images. The game does find iself being bogged down near the middle with seemingly endless ship environments but they don't last too long in retrospect and end just as it would get truely tedious. There are also some texture pop-in issues but they were few and far between.\n\nShadow Warrior is back with a bang! With its emphasis on sadisticly satisfying sword play Shadow Warrior manages to carve itself a unique indentity within the FPS genre. Those who truely appreciate and love old school FPS or melee combat in games should pick up that katana and have a bloodsoaked bash with Wang.","October 13, 2013","true","17.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

What Duke 3D’s Duke was to casual sexism, Shadow Warrior’s Lo Wang was to casual racism. This reboot isn’t as heavy on the corny cliches and stereotyping, but it’s still able to offend the more sensitive types.\n\nThankfully, beneath the oriental trimmings and plot centered around themes of eastern mysticism, is a first-person shooter that excels at being what it is. Flying Wild Hog knows their stuff, as was proven by their excellent yet overlooked cyberpunk shooter Hard Reset (2011). Unlike the recent Rise of the Triad and Duke Nukem reboots, this one nails it. It’s the run-and-gun hard-boiled action 90s first-person shooter fans crave, but with modern trimmings to keep it fresh.\n\nUsing money, karma and ki crystals you find throughout levels, you can upgrade Lo Wang’s guns, buy attachments, and purchase powerful spells. The gunplay works well in conjunction with the spell system, letting you do both at once, for some nice combo moves. After each fight, you get scored based on how creative you were with your bullets, katana and mystical powers. The corny plot even manages to hold it together all the way to the end.","September 22, 2014","true","4.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Every environment spread across 17 levels feels distinct. The only downside is the developers went heavy with the bloom lighting.\n\n+ Combat is fun and satisfying. The game gives you a variety of different weapons at your disposal. The katana, your main weapon is usually your go to weapon when things start to go bad. It slices and dices enemies to bits. You also have guns that are slowly acquired through the game. The first half of the game seems to be more reliant on your katana and when the larger enemies show up is when your guns start to become more useful. You also have a variety of spells and sword techniques that can give you the upper hand in combat. No matter how you choose to dismember your enemies, you will always have a good time.\n\n+ The game features a very robust upgrade system. Money is used to upgrade your weapons. Each weapon has 3 upgrades. Ki crystals are used to upgrade your spells. Each spell has 4 upgrades. Lastly as you defeat your enemies you gain experience which is used to upgrade your passive abilities and sword techniques.\n\n+ Secrets are scattered throughout every level, some secrets are a throwback to the original game\n\n+ The story starts off very weak however the more it starts to reveal itself the more interesting it gets.  The story is told through comic book style cut scenes that look beautiful. Throughout the game you are accompanied by a demon named Hoji who at first is really annoying but starts to grow on you.\n\n+ The game is very polished. Even with all the explosions and all the effects happening my game barely dropped below 60fps.\n\n+ New Game plus to start the game over with all your upgrades and weapons.\n\nThe Average:\n\nYou have the ability to dash forward. If you dash on top of a steep staircase you will die. This gets really frustrating as you will be dashing all the time and this will probably be the cause of a lot of needless deaths.  The developers said this bug/"Feature" cannot be fixed.\n\nAs much fun as the game is, it starts to wear itself out in the last few levels. Once you've seen all the enemies and upgraded all that you need, fighting the same hordes of enemies over and over again starts getting boring. Luckily the game ends before it really becomes a bigger issue.\n\nThis is one of those rare first person shooters where playing with a controller is preferable. The reason being is that you have to input directional inputs to cast your spells and I found it easier to do with a controller than a K/M. In addition the game relies more heavily on melee combat than guns so precise aiming is never really a concern.\n\nSome of the later levels can get a bit confusing.\n\nI felt the last boss was underwhelming. I guess I was expecting something more.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThis game is a remake of an old school FPS however this is not an old school fps. Levels are mostly linear with only one way to progress while throwing large amounts of enemies at you for you to dispose. If you enjoy fighting large groups of enemies while you level up your abilities than you will have a good time with the game. Overall this is definitely worth checking out and a very underrated game that deserves a bit more attention.\n","May 12, 2015","true","36.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But there's enough combat fun, just enough of a challenge, and just enough of a story to get you through that grind.\n\nThe game isn't optimized the greatest in some parts, specifically the first big boss. Then the lighting is pretty weird as well. But for the most part the game plays smooth and looks pretty. The scenery is diverse level to level and the character animations are *mostly* good.\n\nStarting off the jokes are laugh out loud funny, consistent, and constant. But they evaporate almost entirely about halfway through. Even the fortune cookie jokes littered throughout the game run dry. And any clever Easter eggs are near the beginning. It definitely looses its silly charm as you progress.\n\nThe game plays very clean. Each weapon is fun, especially the katana. Couple that with the ability to upgrade the weapons, as well as skill and powers to be unlocked, and the offensive variety stays interesting throughout. I never grew tired of slicing through enemies even after facing the same one for the 1,000th time.\n\nThe funny stuff drew me in, the challenge and fluidity of combat kept me going.

Behead a demon with a crossbow bolt. Shoot a demon with a sticky bomb, then detonate him near an explosive barrel and start a room-clearing chain reaction. Cut a demon in half and get bonus points for dismembering his dead body. If any of these activites appeals to your inner psycho, then Shadow Warrior is the game for you. This game is an intensely gory and ultraviolent rampage through some great environments: cities, graveyards, tranquil shrines, even the Shadow Realm itself. Shadow Warrior sets a high bar for remakes of classic games. The graphics are stunning and the combat is excellent, if unequaled. I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a new shooter. Even better is the continued support of this game by the dev team, who released a massive update 2 years after the game was published, fixing tons of bugs, adding x64 DX11 support, porting the game to Mac and Linux, and making the campaign even more exciting! This is an inredible game and, if you buy it, you will be supporting a great dev team. So grab it on sale or even for full price and let the rampage begin. Wow!

It's your basic run and gun shooter, where you spend most of the time fighting off hordes of enemies. I never played the original so it's nostalgia factor is lost on me. What I will say though is that there is a lot more to this game than I initially thought. The humor is great, the dialogue is quirky/snappy, and the story (while nothing of the mindblowing sort) is suprisingly decent! Some enemies do need a certain strategy to kill. And the campaign is quite lengthy, although I felt it started off a little slow.

This is some of the most fun I've ever had playing an FPS game - that's what Shadow Warrior is from start to finish: pure fun.\n\nYou play as Lo Wang, an assassin sent on a seemingly menial task, until things get completely out of hand with a full blown demonic invasion. Lo Wang and the witty and insightful deuteragonist Hoji, are a delight to listen and their personalities complement each other's perfectly, constantly exchanging light hearted, hilarious quips and wisecracks, but also being serious when circumstances demand. They are a match made in heaven - or hell, in this case. You can't help but chuckle when you listen to them. The story is inspired by old Asian legends and is surprisingly good. It doesn't make much sense at first but things get tied together rather nicely towards the end.\n\nThe combat (which you'll be doing a LOT of) is extremely satisfying and gory. The hectic, always-mobile nature of the fights will keep you to the edge of your seat, especially in the endgame chaotic battles. The gradual introduction of new enemies and weapons keep things interesting. Use variety in your kills and you'll be rewarded extra Karma points, which give you access to a detailed skill tree that you can customize according to your playstyle. This encouragement to use variety lends an almost cinematic quality to some fights, reminiscent of Hong Kong cinema. There are plenty of cool weapons to select from, which can be upgraded with modifications you can buy throughout the game with such over the top options as to add a grenade launcher to your flamethrower, among others.\n\nThe levels are beautifully designed, with varying locales each gorgeous in its own right. The scenery is so nice that you can't help but think at times that you're looking at a postcard - albeit one with pools of blood and dead bodies littered about. It is not always obvious where to go and you might get lost at times, but try to get to the "glowing" door and you'll be alright. Secrets are creatively hidden, and there are references to the old Shadow Warrior and other titles scattered all over the place.\n\nLast but not least - I did not encounter a single bug during my playthrough, a tell tale sign of a very well polished game.\n\nThere are flaws however, although these are more of minor gripes than actual glaring flaws. The one that vexed me the most was that the most dangerous enemies in the entire game are the stairs. That's right: if you dash when at the top of most stairs in the game, you will plunge to your death. Lo Wang can survive being shot and slashed, but a 2 meter drop will either kill him instantly or leave his life hanging by a thread. Another thing was that the rating system at the end of each battle is unpredictable at times, giving you 2/5 stars even if you are quick, accurate, and use variety, and at other times rewarding you with 5/5 stars for no discernable reason (as far as I can tell). The loading times between levels often take quite a while as well.\n\nAll in all however, fantastic game. I really hope Flying Wild Hog makes a sequel to this.","April 8, 2014","true","43.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But there needs to be something, so I'll try to be informative now:\n+ Graphics are amazing. Every location looks stylish and has a lot of details.\n+ Combat feel awesome. It has the good old-school feeling to it. Whether you wield a katana to chop some meat to bloody pieces or just like to shoot baddies from far - it all will feel very intense and satisfying. I really like the presence of alternative modes for shooting weapons. It's something that I missed in shooters long time (screw you, "Press RMB to aim"! Hail to the "Press RMB to kick ♥♥♥!").\n+ You have 4 magic abilities and 4 sword powers. Those are activated by tapping the movement key twice and pressing LMB or RMB (you can use magic while wielding shooting weapons too). If it doesn't work well for you, you can make timing adjusments in settings, which is nice.\n+ Enemies are well varied and have their own strengths and weaknesses. If you use your magic abilities too much, they will become more and more enraged and will attack more swiftly and painfully.\n+ The plot is surprisingly good. The dialogues are well-written and characters are likeable. There's a lot of funny lines.\n+ Secrets! Lots of secrets and easter eggs! Something that I've missed a lot too!\n+ My personal favorite - a lot of interactive, destructable, physical objects (comma before 'physical' is intentional). In latest games I literally HATED the lack of physics, most objects being static pieces of environment (even in action games! that's absurd!). In this game, however, you can let your inner redneck out and smash vases, break tables, ruin the furniture, etc. A decent room may become a total mess after a good fight... or after some fooling around. I loooooove to break stuff.\n\nThere are also some downsides though, but nothing big:\n- Bosses are very similar in terms of fighting them. You just need to shoot the shiny parts of their armor and then destroy the uncovered crystals. Normal enemies make more challenge at some points.\n- A lot of using the "This door is magically sealed! Go destroy 3 statues that are holding the seal!" method. It gives some depth to levels and makes them more varied-less linear (because you have to go search for those statues), but to the game's end it become quite annoying.\n- Players with not powerful enough computers may experience sluggishness and low framerate. I've made it through the whole game on max settings and never had a problem (and my system is not a high-end one), but I saw people complaining on forums, so I think this should be stated here. But you know, people always complain. If your system is good, the game should run just fine.\n\nThat's all, I guess. I adore this game. An intense, fun, sort of nostalgic experience. If you love lots of blood and gore, if you like good humor, if your eyes are used to nice graphics, if you miss the good old days when shooters were clever and challenging - this game brings it all.","February 15, 2014","true","15.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This one was a retro-reboot inspired on the Shadow Warrior released in 1997.\n\nHere we control Lo Wang, a ninja mercenary from modern day time with excellent humor sense, we fight against demons hordes. Game is quite big, there are 17 large chapters, but linear levels with a good amount of secrets and easter eggs to discover.\n\nBesides the good humor sense that game gives us, the combat system very smooth and is very varied, you have nice combos to make, with your sword or weapons.  You get a good number of weapons added to your arsenal as you progress through the game and can carry all of them with you. The combat also has a fantastic melee element with the katana that you start the game with.\n\nWe also have a progression and upgrade system, were we can upgrade our skills and get new powers with the KI crystals. When you upgrade the powers or the skills you can move faster, regenerate health easily or get a new power to Wang use.\n\nNow the worst part of this game was definitely the gameplay, is very boring at least for me, we kill, we follow the goal that most of times is destroy a statue that is blocking a magical door and nothing else to do. Yeah we can find the easter eggs and some other secrets but still, i did expect more on this.\n\nOverall I was surprised at how good this game was. If you are a fan of old-school, fast paced FPS action with a sense of humor then I highly recommend this game.\n\n~ 7/10","April 19, 2014","true","6.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There are some cons though, like the annoying charger enemies, the way the exploding enemies are sometimes used and the upgrade system, which is not bad on its own, but has a rather weak implementation with most of the upgrades being annoying numbers numbers numbers, like it's an RPG, while there's only around five upgrades that actually give you new moves and abilities. The weapon upgrade system is alright though.\nSo, in the end, it's a really good game which has a few shortcomings that don't make you dislike the game. Combine that with the fact that this game is dirt cheap on sales and you get a question - why haven't you played it yet?","July 1, 2015","true","23.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I was positively surprised, this game doesn't rely on just nostalgia. There's plenty of nods to the original, but this is totally new game.\n\nSerious Sam 3 (I haven't played the first two) might be close cousin to this game, but this one has better humor and tighter plot progression. Though I didn't finish Serious Sam, so comparison might not be totally accurate.\n\nWhat you can expect is swordplay that's supported with skills that keep sword relevant during whole game. Also weapons can be upgraded.\n\nGame is relatively linear, which makes it somewhat more frustrating when there's no good clues on where to go next. Though exploration is rewarded, mostly with just ammo and money, but sometimes with karma that will help gaining more skills. And of course fortune cookies!\n\nI think I finished the game in about 20 hours.

I figured that if the newer Rise of the Triad remake sucked so horribly, that there was no hope with this game. But it is a time for rejoicing because this is, thankfully, not what I was expecting.\n\nThis game looks, sounds, and plays beautifully. It is probably the best running, smoothest game I have ever seen which is pretty amazing. One of its high points is that it tells a very well written epic tale that was a pleasure to experience. Most games are not written nearly this well. Overall it has very high production value and looks outstanding. The sounds and music all sound superb and of the highest quality. The graphics are beautiful. The level design and layouts are done very well. The gameplay flows smooth as silk. The weapons are all awesome but the high point of the game is sword combat. It is the most well done, most fun sword combat I have ever seen in a game. Or at least ever in a FPS action game anyway. Melee combat in this game feels really good while in most other games they could not do melee combat right to save their ♥♥♥♥ing lives. You can even tap certain button combos to do awesome helpful sword skills once you unlock them (all moves are simply done by double tapping a single movement key then pressing LMB or RMB, like D, D, RMB).\n\nOne other thing I love in the game are the enemies. The deeper you get, there are new enemies and new boss fights. All of the enemies look very well done like a lot of time and care went into making these enemies as detailed as they are graphically. They also provide a good challenge on higher difficulty.\n\nSo where the newest Rise of the Triad was a complete failure of very poor performance, cheap and often times unavoidable deaths, bugs, boring/few enemy types, crap enemy ai, awful graphics, and really poor level design, this game is like a gift from heaven compared to that game and shares none of those issues. This game deserves a 9/10 in its own right.","May 7, 2015","true","18.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There are some cons though, like the annoying charger enemies, the way the exploding enemies are sometimes used and the upgrade system, which is not bad on its own, but has a rather weak implementation with most of the upgrades being annoying numbers numbers numbers, like it's an RPG, while there's only around five upgrades that actually give you new moves and abilities. The weapon upgrade system is alright though.\nSo, in the end, it's a really good game which has a few shortcomings that don't make you dislike the game. Combine that with the fact that this game is dirt cheap on sales and you get a question - why haven't you played it yet?","July 1, 2015","true","23.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's your basic run and gun shooter, where you spend most of the time fighting off hordes of enemies. I never played the original so it's nostalgia factor is lost on me. What I will say though is that there is a lot more to this game than I initially thought. The humor is great, the dialogue is quirky/snappy, and the story (while nothing of the mindblowing sort) is suprisingly decent! Some enemies do need a certain strategy to kill. And the campaign is quite lengthy, although I felt it started off a little slow.

There’s no waist high walls or the game yelling at you to get back to the combat zone;  just you, a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of enemies, and an arsenal of weapons to use to blow them to kingdom come. Funny thing is though, you probably won’t be using your guns all that much because your katana is one of the best weapons you have and it’s a blast to use.  The game isn’t a cakewalk, you need to be  on your toes even on Normal. Normal has just the right kind of challenge for  a person familiar with FPSes but the real FPS thrill seekers have three higher difficulties to play with. It’s also fairly lengthy, most levels taking around an hour to complete, but it never feels like it overstays its welcome and the environments are changed up enough to stay interesting. The writing is purposely try hard and corny and its amusing because of that though it might not be for everyone. Despite all appearances though it actually has a solid plot for an FPS and it honestly ends up having some real heart. My only real complaint its that the load times are bad, probably because the game has such crazy high graphics. Overall Shadow Warrior is a must play if you love some fast paced hack, slash, and shooty goodness.","January 4, 2014","true","2.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/swordphin/recommended/233130/","swordphin","ﮎ ｗｏｒｄｙ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/swordphin/","221 products in account","A game like no other, and really brings the nostalgic feel of old school shooters and hack n' slash. Haven't played the original Shadow Warrior, though I have played old school shooters like doom and such so I anticipate its the same (please correct me if I'm wrong).\n\nYou are Lo Wang, a seemingly hard-skin individual able to withstand tons of bullets and giant demons in suit of armors with ease. With an arsenal of badarsey weaponry, you will go through a a journey slaying humans and demons alike in a campaign length of about 8 - 15 hours.\n\n***PROS:****\nThe pros. Oh boy. This game really hits you in the head with its old school combat. With drawbacks to the original with fanservice, references and... naked anime girls? The game comes in with 3 skill-tree like interfaces, called Powers, Skills, and Weapons (though the weapons are more like upgrades) which are- in my opinion pretty cool and can make one's user experience easier (please see cons). You will hack and slash (or gun your way through, but to be honest, no one ever uses guns.. right? I hope.) through a multitude of enemy types. Lo Wang, the protagonist, throughout the game undergoes pretty evident character development, going from a brat and dumb to a pro and awesome. The environments are also VERY well made IMO, able to maneuver quickly and efficiently without much obstacles in your way (unless its a corridor then might as well use your guns and dual-akimbo that crud).\n\n****CONS:****\nCons, eh. Like I said before, Powers, Skills and Weapons will make one's user experience much, and I mean, MUCH easier. I really do NOT recommend playing this game on Normal or easier as that will ruin the classic "Shadow Warrior" experience. Besides, old school-like games are mean't to be played with a challenge, no doubt about that. Furthermore, I have two REALLY glaring problems for this game that I think I should address (in my opinion). The first being the enemies themselves. Even though I said that as a Pro point, they really recycled and reused the enemies A LOT. Every few chapters will have 1 new enemy and you will barely need to change your tactics at all. The boss fights are really cool at first, but it kinda disappointed me when every single boss is literally the same "shoot dem armurz and u winz", and to me, most bosses had the same skill sets with different animations (though the last boss fight when you had the Kage sword was pretty damn cool). Second major problem is the map layout and backtracking. As a Pro, the map design (like I said before) is really well made for combat situations. However, the devs seemed to have slacked off about 3/4 into the game. With the map so huge with no sense of direction, I found myself walking back and forth to realize I had to destroy a third statue 2 areas away where I came from in order to progress to the 3rd area I was in. The map flow was ideal for me at the beginning of the game, but it fell off at one point and it just felt damn lazy and it was very boring for me, not to mention that they even reused some parts of the map in other chapters as well.\n\nEven so, I do recommend this game. I wholeheartedly feel that, despite the cons, you will have loads of fun for the dozen of hours you will accumulate. Though, I suggest waiting for a price drop (as I got this for only 10 bucks) as I don't think the amount of content in this game is enough to satisfy that price range now (max 30 dollars imo) but they do include the Viscera Cleanup Detail version for free if you purchase this game.\n\n*NOTE: Everything is in my opinion, so pls no judgey","November 18, 2014","true","7.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I expected it to be way too "modern" or misunderstanding why mid-90s FPS games were good. But the game turned out to be a pleasant surprise.\nIt is, probably, the best modern reinterpretation of the oldschool FPS, as I liked it. Not just a linear gorefest with arenas, but a much more diverse, fantastically looking FPS with pretty huge levels and one of the best first person blade combat systems ever. Genuinly fun humor, good old one-liners, fantatic mix of the old health pack and manual regenaration healing systems, unexpectedly good storyline, fun to find secrets...

Before it came out I was pretty worried about it. Mainly the price and the lack of 3D realms plus they didn't exactly lead an encouraging ad campaign. But the price was sorted out by good deals everywhere within a month of its release. I picked it up for 20 bucks on the humble store and it came with a DRM free copy. And after i got to play through it turned out to be one of my favorite games of 2013.\n\n\nTo start off. This is NOT a straight reboot like Serious Sam 3 or the new Rise of the Triad. Flying Wild Hog (Dev) really put their own spin on the game. The game has the sort of FPS\RPG aspect going on. With abilities and powers. as well you can upgrade your weapons to give them more damage output and if you have a bit of cash stored up you can upgrade them to have a secondary fire which can really change the way you use that weapon.\n\nThe thing that really caught me off guard about the game and what really made it stand out to me were the characters and story. Hoji was funny and likeable and Lo Wang was a real character now instead of a joke like in the original. (Not to bag on Shadow Warrior.)\n\nThe story that you follow is actually prety interesting too. As far as video games go at least. without being 'spoilery', I must say. The way the story goes toward the end will suprise you. They break off from the silly part of the game at the end there to bring you a real conclusion to the story. And I think the ending alone will always make this game stand out to me.\n\n\nTo wrap things up. The gameplay itself is as fun and challenging as you would want and with the skills, powers and upgrades you can take many different approaches to the game and play your own way.","June 21, 2014","true","24.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Haven't played the original Shadow Warrior, though I have played old school shooters like doom and such so I anticipate its the same (please correct me if I'm wrong).\n\nYou are Lo Wang, a seemingly hard-skin individual able to withstand tons of bullets and giant demons in suit of armors with ease. With an arsenal of badarsey weaponry, you will go through a a journey slaying humans and demons alike in a campaign length of about 8 - 15 hours.\n\n***PROS:****\nThe pros. Oh boy. This game really hits you in the head with its old school combat. With drawbacks to the original with fanservice, references and... naked anime girls? The game comes in with 3 skill-tree like interfaces, called Powers, Skills, and Weapons (though the weapons are more like upgrades) which are- in my opinion pretty cool and can make one's user experience easier (please see cons). You will hack and slash (or gun your way through, but to be honest, no one ever uses guns.. right? I hope.) through a multitude of enemy types. Lo Wang, the protagonist, throughout the game undergoes pretty evident character development, going from a brat and dumb to a pro and awesome. The environments are also VERY well made IMO, able to maneuver quickly and efficiently without much obstacles in your way (unless its a corridor then might as well use your guns and dual-akimbo that crud).\n\n****CONS:****\nCons, eh. Like I said before, Powers, Skills and Weapons will make one's user experience much, and I mean, MUCH easier. I really do NOT recommend playing this game on Normal or easier as that will ruin the classic "Shadow Warrior" experience. Besides, old school-like games are mean't to be played with a challenge, no doubt about that. Furthermore, I have two REALLY glaring problems for this game that I think I should address (in my opinion). The first being the enemies themselves. Even though I said that as a Pro point, they really recycled and reused the enemies A LOT. Every few chapters will have 1 new enemy and you will barely need to change your tactics at all. The boss fights are really cool at first, but it kinda disappointed me when every single boss is literally the same "shoot dem armurz and u winz", and to me, most bosses had the same skill sets with different animations (though the last boss fight when you had the Kage sword was pretty damn cool). Second major problem is the map layout and backtracking. As a Pro, the map design (like I said before) is really well made for combat situations. However, the devs seemed to have slacked off about 3/4 into the game. With the map so huge with no sense of direction, I found myself walking back and forth to realize I had to destroy a third statue 2 areas away where I came from in order to progress to the 3rd area I was in. The map flow was ideal for me at the beginning of the game, but it fell off at one point and it just felt damn lazy and it was very boring for me, not to mention that they even reused some parts of the map in other chapters as well.\n\nEven so, I do recommend this game. I wholeheartedly feel that, despite the cons, you will have loads of fun for the dozen of hours you will accumulate. Though, I suggest waiting for a price drop (as I got this for only 10 bucks) as I don't think the amount of content in this game is enough to satisfy that price range now (max 30 dollars imo) but they do include the Viscera Cleanup Detail version for free if you purchase this game.\n\n*NOTE: Everything is in my opinion, so pls no judgey","November 18, 2014","true","7.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I craved for a shooter, but apparently katana's way is so much better! Every non-boss enemy in the game could be defeated with the sword only, even when they teleport on you in big numbers. No big deal — there is always a way to cut poor beggars heads off due to your greater mobility, ki-strikes and self-healing skills. Once you've invested into some Katana Mastery points, the game becomes hectic first person slasher like nothing else. Somehow, the whole game is balanced around beheading your enemies. (Bosses are unlike that though, there is a different gameplay for them to switch your pace.)\n\nQuick snapshot of your further experience with this game: you are below half of your health, dashing like a maniac between blooming sakura trees with your sword drawn, a dozen of lesser demons are running you down, while a pair of greater demons shoot green fireballs at you from afar. Gathering strength for the self-healing ki-strike you bash your way into the midst of the enraged horde: there is a smile on your face.\n\nIn addition, Chinese cookies are delicious in this game.

It's real effin colorful too and forgoes the realistic black and brown plague of recent ''trouble in a Middle-Eastern town'' shooters. Or, god forbid, the blue hue of Battlefield 3, which I just don't get.\n\nActually, I'll update this later when I fully get to the game, but I already know it's gonna be awesome. I'm excited enough for it that I'll recommend it based on first impressions alone.\n\n------\nedit- I was right. It pretty much IS ''Serious Sam with Lo Wang'', the basic level progression is moving forward, encountering several enemies you have to take out, and proceeding with story scenes thrown here and there in the middle or towards the end of the level. Story scenes are kept succinct, obviously.\n\nOne thing this game has that Serious Sam (or any other FPS title) doesn't have is fleshed out melee mechanics. Any other title and the melee weapon is merely a last resort for when you run out of ammo; ♥♥♥♥♥♥, slow, low damage output, and unwanted. Shadow Warrior made it so that your melee is versatile and preferable to long-range weapons. Don't get me wrong, sticky bombs on a crossbow and firing off 6 shotgun shells simultaneously is fun, but you have a dash that lets you get up to your enemies really quickly. You also have a sword technique to impale, to spin 360 degrees and clear out people around you, and to release a long range energy burst. Coupled with your healing technique you'll be dashing into enemies and clearing out waves, pulling back to heal (4 second heal time) and quickly rushing back in.\n\nIn fact, I think its fair to say that the developers wanted you to mainly stick to your sword, since theres a level-up system that requires cash, and you might wanna forego buying ammo for weapons to scrougne up the funds to add bombs to your crossbow or to have auto-fire on your revolver. Which means that you'll only ever use your guns when you have the ammo to spare, to take out those annoying flying enemies, or when facing the larger enemies that really damage you if you stay close to them for long.\n\nHell, I'll call this a first person hack and slash, or a FPS title-First Person Slicer. Witty, I know. There's nothing wrong with the guns, and the upgrades are REALLY worth it and make them incredibly fun. But the attention paid to melee makes this game really unique, and there's something satisfying about having your screen fill with blood and seeing a crowd of ghoulish faces up close rather than taking them out from afar. Your slashes and dashes are arguably more enjoyable than killing people from 15 feet away.\n\nI guess there are some downsides. Weapons are found as you progress with the game, rather than pickups in levels. So you don't get to enjoy the flamethrower until you're deeper into the game. Also, some enemy variety in attack patterns would make combat a little more tactical and less of a 'mow ♥♥♥♥ down' fest. There's the aformentioned bomb enemy, and those flying dudes that become a target range. But it still feels like there could've been more. Let me see...the environments and enemies look good, but some of the character models in cut scenes look a little low-tier, but its an FPS title so who cares. When I'm finding myself trying to pick negatives rather than them coming immediately to mind that means its a good game.","June 24, 2014","true","29.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

It turned out to be much better than I expected, based on the promo videos. SW is a fun action game that is best for melee attacks. If you like Dead Island for melee (like I do), you’ll love Shadow Warrior. That katana is awesome. Guns too, especially later in the game. Purchase the dual-wielding option for the mini submachine gun. Buildup your character (Lo Wang) as the game progresses. Gather money for weapons upgrades, Ki crystals for powers, and karma points for skills. Although the game has lots of light banter, the underlying story is rich and serious indeed, if a bit confusing. This was a surprising and pleasing discovery. It helped motivate me thorough what begins to be a grind of arena battles, of which there are many, many.\n\nBosses are enormous giants. Boss fights are doable and not too hard. Just remember to heal yourself frequently, circle to pick up powerups and shoot for the weak points when they appear. The “powers” must be invoked by keyboard/mouse combos. This can be a bit of a problem because it takes a bit of doing to remember them and invoke them when you need them most – during a battle.\n\nMap landscapes and architecture are very detailed and often beautifully done. Shadow world maps are sparse.

I have many, many fond memories of that/those games. So when I first heard that they were rebooting it, I was a little hesitant. However, then I heard that Flying Wild Hogs was at the helm and I felt a little better. However, I also was worried that the racial stuff (which in many ways made the original what it was) would not be present due to the climate of today’s society... and quite frankly, rightfully so. Many of those racial things in the original were extreme and highly racist, so they really have no place in a modern intelligent game. Anyway, I am pleased to say that they did away with the racist stuff and improved on almost every aspect of the Shadow Warrior universe. The combat and controls are tight. The guns are amazing. The enemies are relentless. The core mechanics are awesome. But at the forefront is the swordplay. The Katana is no longer just a melee weapon that you use when you run out of bullets. It is the star of the show. I would argue that it is second main character of the whole game. If you liked hard reset, you will love this game. If you like Japanese culture, you will love this game. If you love great single player, story driven FPS's, you will absolutely love this game!

On one hand - it's fine specimen of FPS genre. On the other - it's just that.\n\nWith it's outdated graphics and developers clear issue with making smaller objects it looks medicore at best from technical side. But the design? Very good, instantly catching that cheap oriental feeling of the '70 we all know from the movies and references to old titles.\n\nGunplay is perfectly fine, all weapons feel right, have nice upgrades and even the revolver - your first firearm - is valid chocie till the end of the game. OK, the flamethrower - undperpowered. But except it, it'sjust fine. Unfortunately Katana and powers are "meh" all the way. While you will be running withy it, slicing and dicing quite a lot, it's unintuitive in use so you will keep to two moves that are more than enough to solve most of your demonic problems.\n\nAnd the plot? Yes, there is one. But as we say in Poland - dupy nie urywa or it's not mindblowing for those who can't speak more elaborate languages ;) It's not something that will keep you playing. Until the very end you will learn some facts, you will hear few stries. But it becomes understandable at the very end of the game. Wheter it is good or bad - it'scompletly personal. I liked it.  Much more interesting than main plot are small talks bewteen Wang and Hoiji (our demonic sidekick).\n\nWhen it comes to music - I have no idea. I turn off music in almost all games. But the sounds are good. Vocies too. And only thing that makes you irritated are Wang's one liners after gruesome kill. They are cheap - whichmight have been on purpose - and after heaing the same one dozens of time, you can get a bit angry...\n\nOverall... As I said at the begging. It's fine example of FPS but it's just that and there is plenty of titles that are just as good as "Shadow Warrior". Those of you who play shooters casually - it won't be good enough. FPS fans will find it suitable to distract their attention while they wait for some AAA title.

I fully recommend it.","December 29, 2015","true","19.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","75","3","4","4","0"

Not much for flashy cinematics or crazy depth, it tells a fairly decent, albiet confusing at times, story of Lo Wang, your protagonist with an off-colour mouth, and his demoic sidekick. The dialogue between them two is honestly genuinely funny, and between waves of various demons and monsters, it's placed out pretty well. The variety of powers, weapons and attacks you can use is pretty lengthy. Upgrades to all of them are available as well, and offers a pretty solid action package with secrets and moderate replayability, and a healthy campaign length.\n\nAs a fan of the early 90s shooters, I loved this remake, though I didn't play the original. At times challenging, a few levels a bit long, but fun weapons, enemies and abilities, I'd definitely recommend it.","June 3","true","17.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","2"

Lo Wang's boss wanted a precious sword. When he talks to the owner of the sword, he says no. After that, things go south....FAST. Wang become a mass murdering, kitana welding foe for them. When exploring the palace for the sword, things go south again as you are captured by the owner of the sword and locked away. While all that happens, demons start to roam the earth, killing anyone in sight. You escape from the thing they call a prison and find out the owner of the sword died from a fire you have also fallen into. On the brink of death, you find out that the owner (I dont know his name) had a demon, trapped and banished to roam the earth, named Hoji. When you team up with him, you get abnormal powers such as healing. Other that the story is pretty bad.\n\nBut I don't think anyone is here for the story. The gameplay of this game is f***ing awesome. This game has a score system after every wave of enemies you kill in the area. With the karma points, as they are called, you can buy abilities and ability upgrades. The scoring system kinda works like Bulletstorm, the more the combo and people you kill with one action, the more points. It works really well with this game, it makes the game more exciting and makes you want to try to get better combos and see how many points you can get with one action. The store and shop to upgrade your guns is very limited, 4 attachments for each gun. There's a pistol, submachine gun, crossbow and many more that you unlock farther in the game.The gunplay in this game is good. I only say that because when you have a kitana that can cut people in as many bits as the game will let you, you want to use that. Using the kitana will give you hours of amusement. I said this but, "It's like Fruit Ninja, just with a lot of blood" - Jeff the Killer\n\nThe graphics are beautiful. I don't know if it is my computer or not, but I can't run the game max settings. It's like Serious Sam with FPS, you'll get 60 in one place and 20-30 in another. I'll probably fix this part of the review when I get my 760 for now, this is my review on graphics.\n\nOverall, even though I haven't finished the story, you don't need a story to play a game, there are some exceptions, like this game. I think the story adds a bit more feel for the game so do Wang's funny a** one-liners. I recommend this game soooooooooo much. Only thing, is the price for this game is a bit high, I'd wait for a sale, 30-40 is way too high. Wait till a sale that brings it down to 10-15 bucks. 9/10 is what I give this game.","December 3, 2013","true","12.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","3"

The most prominent case in recent history that comes to mind would be Bioshock Infinite, or rather its "1999 Mode", which was advertised to be a throwback to the unforgiving difficulty of System Shock 2. But instead of adding inventory or item management it just turns the enemies into bulletspongy death machines. So it goes.\nBut I digress. After all, I am trying to review Shadow Warrior 2013 here.\n\nSo, is this game true to its claim of being a throwback to the days of Doom and Build Engine games? The short answer is no!\n\nLevel Design:\nIf you are expecting complex maze like levels, ala Doom or Duke3D, you are out of luck. While Shadow Warrior 2013 gives you plenty of crates to loot for ammo and money as well as keys to hunt for in order to advance to the next area, it still feels like a streamlined version of 90's FPS level. This is not an issue for me however, since I usually got lost once the levels got too complex in later episodes of these types of games. Though I do have to point out, that I still managed to get lost in these rather simplistic levels, because I got stuck more then often without knowing what I had to do. This was mostly due to the fact that SW2013 Highlights usable items with an incredibly obnoxious glow effect that makes it easy to differentiate between geometry and usable entities. Since I am not a fan of these types of mechanics I played the game with the effect off, which unfortunately resulted in me sometimes not being able to figure out what to do because the switch I was supposed to press just blended in with the scenery. That's the issue with these types of helpers. Even if you have the option to disable them, game game is still designed with them in mind, making it unnecessarily complicated to discard them even if you want to.\n\nCore Gameplay:\nYou are equipped with an arsenal of firearms as well as a Katana and an endless supply of underpowered Shurikens that drain your regenerating stamina meter as you throw them. Speaking of regeneration, your health does not automatically regenerate. Instead there are medipacks and armor vets scattered throughout the levels. Despite that fact that there is no auto health regen, you still have the ability to heal yourself in form of a Ki Power. Ki Powers are combos that you can pull of as a player by completing a sequence of actions. For instance, to initiate your healing ability you press D twice in a row and then press Mouse2, holding it down. Most KI Powers either give you crowd control over enemies, or new moves with your Katana.\n\nThroughout the game the play can find KI Crystals that allow him to upgrade or unlock powers. Speaking of Upgrading there are two other kinds of progression. The first one is the Karma system. If you use a wide variety of skills and weapons to kill of enemies, you are rewarded with Karma points that you can spend to level up various stats, such as your maximum health as well as the amount of damage you deal to certain types of enemies. How ever, by doing so you will cause some enemies to enter their rage form which makes them more aggressive and dangerous.\n\nIf we are talking about damage dealing, we need to talk about the weapons as well. Throughout the levels you will find money which you can either spend on ammo (don't ever do this!) or on weapon upgrades. Each weapon has an essential upgrade that will turn it into a great DPS dealer, you will have to resort to in case you get overwhelmed by hoards of enemies. Unfortunately this means that all wepaons are utter trash unless you spend money to upgrade them.\n\nThe core shooter mechanics however, is where this games shines. 95% of all enemies either use a projectile or melee attacks in order to deal damage to you. This means that there is no need to ever take any cover, allowing you do keep track of all projectiles and dodging them accordingly. To help you with this, the game allows you to jump in all four directions which adds a refreshing dynamic to the combat. To add to the challenge all enemies use a rather modern hit box system, that allows you to shoot off limps in order to immobilize them. You need to stand still trying to aim for a the head of the on coming enemies, pull the trigger and then do a quick jump to the left or right, to avoid the amount of stuff that comes flying towards you, ready to explode in your face. That being said, the shooting has its weaknesses though, especially concerning the stronger enemy types. There is one in particular that really grind me gears: The Shaman is a so called "greater demon" or mini boss that frequently shows up raising an infinite army of undead enemies, as well as shooting projectiles towards you. He is a real bulletsponge and fighting him is the very antithesis of fun. This gets issue grows less and less important as your weapons grow more powerful and your skill increases. Keep in mind that I was playing on the "Hard" difficulty setting. The bigger problem are the bossfights. They stink. All of them use the same mechanic, which is extremely tiresome and boring. Even though all bosses use a slightly different attack pattern, you feel like you are fighting the same boss over and over again. This is no different concerning the final boss, which was a major letdown for me.\n\nStory and Presentation:\nSW 2013 tries to get rid of the "racist and misogynistic" humor of the original game, replacing it with an emotional story. While the game manages to pull of the plot quite well, you should under no circumstances except something like Bastion or The Walking Dead which leave you completely emotionally destroyed, if you get emotionally invested with their respective characters. Shadow Warrior doesn't do this and leaves you indifferent at best towards the whole tragedy in which the games ends. Speaking of ending, the more you advance the more unpolished and untested the game feels. The game builds up an epic confrontation with Zilla, a Faustian villian who caused the invasion of the shadow realm onto the human word for his own needs. But instead of fighting him and adding some much needed variety to the bossfights, you just face him (twice!) in a first person cutscene. The same applies to the leader of the shadow beings. How overwhelmingly disappointing. Heck, the final boss fight doesn't even have music like the others with makes it even more boring.\n\nTechnology:\nThe games is extremely resource demanding even on my 4770k/GTX 780 rig and does not look good enough in order to justify this. Instead it makes about every other object in a level explosive which unleashes a storm of death and physics across the screen. I also had some issue with the vsync, that caused the FPS to drop to 30 once it went below 60, which was extremely annoying, up to the point where I just disabled it end endured the screen tearing instead.\n\nVerdict\nOverall Shadow Warrior 2013 is a great indie shooter with solid gameplay and a disappointingly weak presentation that completely falls flat on its face near the end of the game. If you are a fan of games like Serious Sam or Painkiller, this game is a must buy for you. But don't except a real 90's shooter, because it just isn't one.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe good\n-Solid and fun gameplay\n-Combat based on projectile avoidance and strafing\n\nThe bad\n-Story and presentation fall completely flat towards the end.\n-Resource intensive\n-Terrible bossfights","December 18, 2013","true","23.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

And after you're convinced that you're playing a superficial action game with another vapid set of cliche characters, somewhere along the line after all the fan service and wisecracks and gore, you realise that you're invested in the story and you care about the characters, and suddenly you become aware of how shockingly well-made this game is.\n\nGiven the patchy success-rate of recent nostalgic reboots and reimaginings (I'm looking at you, ROTT), Shadow Warrior suprised the hell out of me with it's smooth and responsive controls, entertaining gameplay, beautiful visuals, and well-cast voice actors. It understands exactly what it wants to be at any given moment, and excels at both the early tongue-in-cheek schlock, as well as the later more serious character development. This is clearly a game in which all the talent behind the scenes really shines through, and I can't recommend it highly enough.","December 28, 2013","true","11.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The swordplay is something I have never seen before and the first couple of hours you get some nice story bits and you progress quickly in terms of new weapons, getting new skills and seeing new enemies. But after a couple of chapters you go through a corridor enter a big room and see the same enemies. Then you walk through the next corridor and enter a big area with the same enemies. I was getting 1 or 2 funny lines from Wang for every 100 boring enemies I had to kill. I played shooters like Wolfenstein the New Order where I forgot what I was doing, because the story was so interesting. Here you walk through rooms to get to the next enemies and I have no motivation to finish this game.\n\nP.S. thats just my opinion.

Visit my profile page and go through my screenshots. The game is GORGEOUS.\n\nSo what about the rest of the game? Well from a long time and avid player of the FPS genera, it's a mixed bag. I played the game twice all the way through. Once on "normal" difficulty and then again on "insane". On normal I used the Katana the entire time. That was probably stupid, but the melee combat felt extremely satisfying. The Ki powers were also a blast to use. That wore off about 8 hours into the game. Little did I know there's 8 more hours to grind through. I got that feeling of: "Is this over yet?"\n\nWell after some consideration I felt like I should give the game another try. My inner achievement hunter had something to do with it too! :-)\n\nThe second time I went with insane mode and used all the weapons. With the inclusion of the 1.5 optimization patch the game looked and ran better than ever. However, the weapons felt weak. Extremely weak. Even the bad-♥♥♥ looking quad barreled shotgun. Once I got my hands on the crossbow and the its chargeable shot upgrade, the game became cake. With fully upgraded healing powers and the one shot crossbow, yet again I got that feeling of boredom.\n\nSo why am I recommending this game after calling it boring? Because it's like a really pretty bowl of oatmeal. There really isn't anything "wrong" with the game. It just middle of the road with a great number of sights to see.\n\nMy main gripe with Shadow Warrior is it tries to please everyone at the same time. The attempt of fusing old school and new doesn't seem to work for me. The game contains the Bioshock "Look everywhere for cash" loot system. It also has RPG elements, unlockables, and a low assortment of opponent's to kill. My opinion is if you going to make a FPS, choose a school and stick with it.\n\nPro's +\n\n+++ Level Design + A huge range of environment's and aesthetics to enjoy! So many sights to behold!\n+ Optimized + Looks great and runs really well!\n+ Characters + The chemistry between Low Wang and his demon friend is quite entertaining.\n+ Story + Easy to follow and keeps your interest.\n+ Arsenal + Large variety of weapons and powers to make combat interesting - for a time...\n+ Melee Combat + The Katana is really fun to play with!\n+ Secrets + A must for any FPS.\n+ EX Mode + Allows you to keep all your upgrades after you beat the game.\n\nCon's -\n\n- Enemies - Offers a limited amount of baddies to slay.\n- Unbalanced Weapons - On the highest difficulty some of the weapons are pretty weak.\n- Loot - If you want your weapons to have additional features, you better look EVERYWHERE for cash.\n- Game Length - Game progression is entirely "gated". Everything is locked until you kill each wave of enemies.\n\nShadow Warrior goes on sale frequently at 75% off. Well worth it at that price. If your playing for the first time, play the game on either easy or normal. Don't do what I did, use all the weapon's in the game!","July 17, 2015","true","42.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","1"

It was great. Hillarious dialogue and "modern graphics". (It was honestly, the first time I'd heard the joke: *ring ring* "Hello? Is your refrigerator running? Better go catch it!" Lol.)\n\nBut this game, this is a different game. Much more gritty. It has a more modern edge to it. (Edge, sword? see what I did there?)\n\nThe maps are good - although I did find that I was confused in some places (mostly because I missed the obvious), the sound track is quite nice, the story is solid and graphics are pleasing.\n\nThere are bunches of secrets and tributes to the original Shadow Warrior (& Hotline, Serious Sam etc etc). And of course, a sweet sword. (also, enemies block - which is always a nice element.)\n\nAll in all, a good game. :)\n\nNote: Does contains swears here and there, there are dealings with the 'demon-esque', and the like, in the overall story line - as the enemies consisting of them. So if you're touchy about those things, you might want to give this one a miss.\n\n"WHOOOOOOOOOooooooooooooo want some Wang?!" ~ Lo Wang (Snr)","September 2, 2015","true","20.2"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","7","12","3","0"

See, that's what happened here, and for a skinflint like me to admit that says volumes.\n\nShadow Warrior then. Reboot of the "classic" (racist) 3D Realms FPS, which I liked as a kid but which time has not been kind to. Remember how the ratings board in the UK made them replace the shurikens with darts, 'cos of fears that children would start lobbing death stars at each other? Darts are impossible to throw, of course, and not widely available. Not like shurikens, which are EVERYWHERE.\n\nLo Wang is back, and once again he has brought along his little book of cheeky, timely quips. This time around they're quite funny, so that's ok. He's now a lackey for the head of Zilla Corp. (remember them from the first game?), and when an attempt to buy an ancient sword goes awry, Lo Wang is forced to chase it down, and graphically butcher anyone and everyone in his path. You've got your sword and your guns and here are some bad guys, what more do you want?\n\nHow about MAGIC POWERS? Yep, don't remember those from the Shadow Warrior of old. After a demon hitches a ride in your body, you get the power to earn and spend Karma points (found in blood fountains and as a reward for killing enemies, more on that later) on spells. My favourite is the healing spell, because I'm so often at death's door...\n\nThe action here is decidely old-school, and blisteringly fast. Lo Wang is, when he's not tripping over his own appendage, a nimble chap. By tapping shift you can do a short range dash in any of the cardinal directions, getting right up into an enemies face to hack him to bits with the katana, or leaping back to find a safe spot and get a spell ready. Speaking of which, most of them are offensive, and you'll want to use them in battle as often as you can. Some clever design ideas help keep the action in full flow, like how enemies frequently leave a soul when they're killed which will replenish your health during a fight. You'll want to charge in and keep killing, lay waste to all before you, hoovering these up as you go, and chip away at the bigger, stronger enemies.\n\nShadow Warrior, like the excellent Bulletstorm before it, features a "points" system, where certain actions award points, and collecting them affects your rating after each big fight, and how much bonus Karma you'll get. For instance, beheading an enemy might get you 100 pts, whereas simply killing it by shooting it in the chest will only get you 10. You are rewarded for speed, flair, and ingenuity - keep an eye out for explosive barrels! You might successfully defeat a big horde of enemies without taking a speck of damage, but if you were too slow and didn't mix things up, you'll get a paltry karma reward. It isn't rare to find after a big fight that you'll want to do it all over again, to see if you can get a bigger bonus (and make a bigger mess).\n\nThe real star of the show in terms of weaponry is your trusty Katana, and I've never grown bored of it. The guns are all perfectly good, nothing wrong with them at all, but the katana is so good, it's tough to let it go. I was playing this and iD software's RAGE concurrently, and I missed it so much. I felt slow, and leaden. Lo Wang has speed and power.\n\nMatron.\n\nI like this game a lot more than I thought I would. It's not big and it's not clever, but it is a heck of a lot of fun and a great palate cleanser between more serious games.

Good fun combat and very robust upgrade system, but the story alone is worth it. It has a good ending that brings closure but also gives you something to think about.

The gameplay is hands down the best part of this, Shadow Warrior makes itself different with it's star-based system that rewards you with extra Karma(Basically experience points) based on how well you kick Demon ♥♥♥, I've gone through over 10 chapters and haven't gotten a single 5-star, but this is motivation for me to try harder and hopefully get better to the point I get that 5 star. Thrown in is the best sword in any FPS ever, the player's Katana is the most versatile tool the player has, and it naturally upgrades over time as you continue the story, it can do powerful bursts of damage, an area swing, and one of those fancy air slashes that can mow down groups of enemies chasing you.\n\nHopefully I didn't overwrite stuff, or missed small details, but I can go on and on about why I think this is an excellent game and one of the best purchases I made in a while. Please, buy it, maybe even buy it while it's full priced to show the developers some love.\n\nThis is seriously what Duke Nukem should've been...minus the sword, and uh...less Shadow Warrior, more Duke.","December 22, 2014","true","12.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I played it in 3D, which just made everything all the more beautiful.\n\nI wasn't into the story of this one so much (a lot of it just went over my head to be honest), but that gameplay was very refreshing and more than made up for it - it brings all the best parts of old school shooters without the all the baggage.\n\nIt also brings some extremely satisfying swordplay to the table - quite possibly the best we have ever experienced in a video game and easily my favourite means of dispatching enemies outside of boss fights.\n\nIt doesn't matter if you have played the original or not (the original is free btw), if you have played the original there is plenty of homage to be found - the anime girls are back (completely unchanged) and there are even a couple of secret areas straight out of the original (like Lo Wang's Dojo of Death from level 1, or the Dark Woods from later in the game). If you haven't played the original, don't worry - this game easily stands by itself, you'll just miss a couple of references (like why there are rabbits everywhere - oh yeah, the "no ordinary rabbit" is back - kinda...).\n\n\nI have to give it bonus points for having zero rendering artefacts with nVidia 3D Vision and a crosshair that's actually usable in 3D (i.e. positioned some distance into the scene)! I won't be uploading any screenshots (other than the glitch shots I already uploaded) since they're all in 3D and I don't particularly feel like converting and importing them to Steam.

The heavy melee focus sets it apart from similar games like Serious Sam or the Painkiller series, while you try to keep your distance from enemies in most shooters, here you will seek close contact much more often.\n\nThe levels are large and despite there being only one linear path to actually progress, there is always lots of secrets and pick-ups hidden in dark corners. Some might complain, that the lack of a mini-map or any kind of quest-marker makes it hard to know where to go sometimes, even when losing your way chances are high that you find at least something helpful or funny along the way.\n\nFun is something the game emphasizes a lot, the story is light, but the dialogs present range from cheeky to hilarious. There are three main settings, and the graphics are still great, especially the lighting is impressive throughout. Some bad textures and a couple of boring industrial areas in the second act dimish the overall good visual impression.\n\nThe only real downside to the game is the lack of enemy variety, since Shadow Warrior follows in Painkiller and Serious Sam’s footsteps of offering large scale battles and seemingly endless waves of enemies, there should be more enemy types to mix things up a bit better. As a result it is recommended to play this game not in long sessions but one or two levels a day. This way it keeps fresh and entertaining.\n\nPro:\n- fantastic swordplay\n- good variety of useful guns\n- Full of pop-culture jokes\n- solid upgrade system\n- beautiful lighting and settings\n\nCons:\n- not enough enemy variety\n- some boring levels\n- easy to get lost in the larger levels","December 22, 2014","true","20.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After the opening section of the game, weaker foes will fall before you with ease, but their tougher comrades aren't going to let you off the hook. However, this can be both a blessing and a curse.\n\nConstantly challenging enemies serve an important purpose in gaming: they keep the difficulty from dropping so low that the game ceases to be interesting. At the same time, however, this can lead you as a player to feel like you're never improving as you progress. Shadow Warrior unfortunately falls into this category from time to time. New sword techniques will always look and feel impressive when you first learn them, but eventually it will start to seem as though your enemies are shrugging them off with little effort.\n\nSimilarly, the gun combat sometimes feels downright neglected compared to the swordplay. There are weapon upgrades and a few relevant skills, but the absence of anything resembling gun-kata makes firearms feel like somewhat overgrown support tools rather than their own beasts.\n\nDespite the above criticism, however, Shadow Warrior is still a greatly entertaining experience. Although the guns aren't as interesting as the sword, few games allow you to slice and shoot quite as fluidly as this one.","December 23, 2014","true","11.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ansib/recommended/233130/","Ansib","Mr.Pie BSc","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ansib/","331 products in account","Shadow Warrior is one of those games that didn't catch my interest well enough for me to buy it when it came out. I can't believe it took me this long until i finally saw it on the steam sale and said to myself "£2...not bad. Let's do this" I install this, launch the game and i am greeted with the well known song 'Stan Bush - You got the touch' which immediatly brings back memories of me re-watching The Transformers movie for the billionth time.\n\nAnyway. You are Lo Wang. Or as he likes to call himself "Mr. Two Million Dollars", you had this one simple job. Get the sword and give the money, but the owner doesn't want to part with it. Maybe he has developed some intimate emotions with it. I dont know...one minute i'm standing in front of all these gang members and the next i'm slaughtering them into pieces, literal pieces that slowly fall off from each other. Think Resident evil laser room scene. This was cool as ♥♥♥♥.\n\nThe game progresses as you find that your boss (Zilla) is trying to find 2 swords, one of which you now possess and the others being elsewhere and these all link in with a Demon Realm and how the 3 swords combined are the only thing that can kill the Ancient Gods. So with the help of the dementia ridden Demon known to you as Hoji you go from environment to environment. Looking for whisperers who can hold the swords (demons can't hold the swords as it will kill them) The whisperers are mechanical beings that are powered by memories that are sacrificed by Ancients and as they are roboty they are not affected. That's pretty much it, find the girl whisperers, kill them and combine the swords for that perk and to get one stop closer to kicking an Ancient Gods ♥♥♥, Wang style.\n\nThe combat works suprisingly well, there was some worrying at the beginning as to how i'm going to remember all the moves but eventually you're locking down combos like it's Tekken (or streetfighter if that's more your thing) Want to sexually touch your sword so you can whip a blade ki slash to decapitate your enemies? Doubletap 'S' and hold RMB. Want to immobilize the enemies infront of you? Then Doubletap S and hold LMB. It's very easy to use. You have RMB for sword attack based movies and LMB for Ki based movies such as healing, throwing enemies up in the air, pushing them back and such.\n\nOne thing that i did find irritating was how secrets were tied into upgrades and perks. I didn't want to be held back in unlocking the upgrades simply because i didn't find that Ki crystal behind those boxes that have to be slashed. I mean, the first time you came upon the Ki crystal, it wasn't even the path you were supposed to take to your mission! It does however change the way you play the game, making you look in every nook and cranny and slashing maniacally at those poor boxes to get that small statue.\n\nLo Wang came off as a serious ♥♥♥♥♥♥, in fact. I think he was just born an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ from beginning to end and his transition from "I'm so full of it" to "He's my friend and i'm going to help him" was very quick that i suddenly thought i was playing as someone else! He's quick witted as intended by the developers but man were his jokes corney. I loved them!\n\nShadow Warrior would have been my most favourite FPS if i had played it back in 2013. It's a shame it took me this long to finally get around to playing it, it was worth every penny and i really do recommended it.\n\nBy the way, if you find two rabbits getting it on. Please don't kill them, that male rabbit will not be pleased... ♥♥♥♥ing demons...*grumble grumble*","November 29, 2014","true","9.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Decapitating enemies with a pink ♥♥♥♥♥ has its quirks as well. The guns aren't too powerful so as to force you to use your sword but the bosses are impossible to kill without them so it's a good idea to familiarize with each of them.\nThe normal difficulty shouldn't pose much of a challenge as I have only died by falling off platforms rather than in battle but the two difficulty levels above are suffient to pose a challenge to those who seek it.\nThe jokes are hilarious.\nIt is ill advised to kill rabbits if you value your life.","December 6, 2013","true","24.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Shadow Warrior has it all: great graphics, awesome weapons, blood-pumping soundtrack, fast-paced action, hidden collectibles, one-liners, and a surprisingly good sense of humor. Even with the fast-paced combat, explosions, and the hail of bullets you'll be sending towards the enemy, that's not the best part. The best part of Shadow Warrior is the sword-play which combined with the supernatural powers you get is done surprisingly well. The game has great features such as a quick-slash, shuriken throwing, and consumable weapons like the demon head and heart. To keep things interesting, all weapons are upgradeable adn so are your powers. Even with all of the solid aspects of the game, it goes above and beyond with things that most games would have left out such as equippable skins for your sword, an ultra-hard final difficulty, new game plus, an arena mode, fortune cookies, and fully destructable bicycles.","May 15, 2014","true","27.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

From the very first bars of the opening song, I knew that Flying Wild Hog (the developers) had made a game for someone like me.\n\nFlying Wild Hog got The Touch.\n\nThat was worth the £20 right there. Just to know that someone recognised the demographic even existed. The rest of the game? The exact same message – “we know you exist, we know what you enjoy, and we’re just like you”.\n\nThe humour hits just the right level of stupid, and the game itself is just so damn good it makes up for the occasional lapses.\n\nThe combat is slick. There's no grinding, no pointless backtracking, no juggling three different economies for the sake of it, no "trans-media experience required for optimal progression", no billion pointless collectibles. All of the enemy types stay relevant throughout rather than being replaced with the usual palette-swapped-but-tougher bore-fest.\n\nIt's linear, but beautiful and a crazy ride.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OddballEddie/recommended/233130/","OddballEddie","Grifon Eddie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OddballEddie/","549 products in account","I liked the original Shadow Warrior quite a lot, it's a game that's fond to me since I grew up playing it, so seeing news of a new re-imagined game usually ends up being bad news, luckly this isn't the case here. Flying Wild Hog did a good job modernizing the core concepts and retaining or making various nods to the original.\n\nThe main concern for fans when this got announced was that old pervy Lo Wang was nowhere to be found being replaced by a younger Lo Wang. While it is true that this is a re-imagining, the story nearly serves as a prequel to the classic Shadow Warrior, I won't say much as to not spoil the story, suffice to say that while starting off being silly there's a surprisingly good story that unfolds in a rather sneaky manner as the game progresses, the developers truly delivered on the promise of a better story, only don't expect it to be all out exagerated parody of cliches like Duke Nukem 3D and the Classic Shadow Warrior were. There is a good deal of humour but it's not the main focus.\n\nVisuals are for the most part gorgeous, the scenery is colorful and varied with a mainly Japanese aesthetic, only problem I found was that the later levels end up getting a bit repetitive but the overall art direction is quite beautiful.\nMost of the enemies come in a nice variety, visually the lesser demons will have some acessories to set them apart but it won't affect much how you'll dispatch them, the humam enemies end up being the most unimpressive looking, but luckily there aren't many humans after the first chapter.\nThe game's areas are mostly arenas tied up by a somewhat linear path the areas you fight are diverse in shapes and most of them include plenty of environmental hazards to use against your enemies, there's plenty of secrets to be found as well, most of them are cash, ammo and karma awards that ties into the upgrade system which I'll mention later in the review.\n\nThe sound design is also very good, guns sound really well and apropriate, you'll hear the demons screeching at you or grunting in pain once you slice them. The music ends up mostly being background noise but they serve their purpose, it doesn't quite stand out since it's mostly muffled by all the carnage that's going down.\n\nWhere the game truly shines is the gameplay, there's a lot to cover here. You'll still have point based health system and you'll still be able to have nearly ten weapons on you while you fight hordes on enemies. But there's a few twists involved, now you have access to magic that can either stun enemies, protect or heal you, but there are limitations that ends up balancing their use, like the healing power only regenerates a portion of your health, you'll still need medpacks to get it back to 100%. You can use the spells any time without needing to waiting for them to recharge, some may leave you vulnerable while casting while other might limit your attack options, overall the spells are nice but aside from healing I forgot that I had most of them during the fights.\n\nMost of the weapons from the original game comes back in one way or another, you'll get a Revolver, Uzi, Crossbow, Shotgun, Flamethrower and Rocket Launcher though you'll only get them at specific points in the story with the Katana being a permanent weapon throughout the entire game.\nThe katana is a blast to use, while the damage isn't always the most realistic you'll still have a gratifying feeling once you chop down your enemies to bits and getting the extra attacks for the sword makes it really fun to use. Another comeback to the arsenal are the enemies body parts you can still get the lesser demon's Hearts as an one shot weapon to instantly kill a few smaller enemies in an area or chop off the Warlord's heads that shoot a fire stream. An upgrade system has also been included, which you'll spend the money you find to buy secondary fire modes, improvements or ammo for the main weapons.\n\nAfter every fight you get ratings that evaluate how well you've fought, they seem to be mostly altered by the diversity of weapons used in a fight and how much of the environmental hazards you've used during said fights at the end you get awarded with Karma points depeding on your rating. When you have enough Karma you'll get skill points which mostly give passive upgrades or new sword attacks.\nThere's plenty of other upgrades which will have you searching every area, you have money for weapons, karma (You can also find demonic altars with bowls of blood) for passive upgrades and skills and Ki Crystals to learn new or upgrade your magic. It's a very diverse but simple system in place.\n\nWhen it comes down to it I had a blast playing Shadow Warrior, it's a terrific throwback to the older style of FPS with a few modern twists while during the first playthru it felt a little easy the extra difficulties and Heroic mode add a greater challenge. This is an easy recommendation to make if you enjoy single-player shooters and got tired of playing linear corridor spectacle shooters.\n\nP.S: Oh yeah, kill the bunnies after they get it on, you'll eventually get a surprise  ;)","November 9, 2013","true","44.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vhmz/recommended/233130/","vhmz","#FAIAA EMBUREM","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vhmz/","526 products in account","Shadow Warrior came out of nowhere and blew my mind. It is the best single player FPS game I have played in a long time. The gameplay itself might get repetitive toward the end of the game, but the well written dialogue and great characters kept me interested.\nShadow Warrior is a reimagining of the 1997 game of the same name. Some things connecting this new game to the 1997 original is some similar naming of locations, the main character and the heavy use of katana as a melee weapon, but basically you are not missing anything if you haven't played the original or even know nothing about it.\n\nHere are some additional scrabled thoughts about the game\n\nWhat I liked\n-The story, characters, voice acting, visuals and soundtrack.\n-The story is a mix between drama and comedy. Usually this is a bad idea, but somehow Shadow Warrior makes the mood shifts enjoyable. One of the most important reasons as to why Shadow Warrior has such good characters is that they are a mix of dramatic and comedic traits, which makes them very approachable and human.\n-Good enemy variety. Different weapons/techniques are also required to beat some of the harder enemies.\n-Good weapon variety, and you can carry all the weapons at once without needing to swap. There's also a weapon upgrade system in place. The upgrades are kind of scarse, so it's always interesting to get one and the upgrades have real impact, and most of them are not like "+5% accuracy", but alternative firing modes and such.\n-Flow of the game. There's a good rhythm with the story bits, enemy encounters, humour, serious moments, exploration. It is aslo separated into chapters that range from about 20 minutes to 40 minutes, so it is nicely paced in terms of when you can just shut the game and take a break or do something else entirely.\n-Melee combat. It has a melee combat system with some executable special moves. The moves are always just double tap a directional key and press LMB or RMB, but still it's fun to execute them.\n-It has this kind of (but not quite) hint system where you need to always use objects or doors that glow yellow. I thought it was much more pleasant than the reqular arrow or path that shows you exactly where you need to go. When there was not immediate in your face indication of where to go I found myself exploring and taking in the world a lot better than in, say BioShock Infinite.\n\nWhat I didn't like\n-The boss battles are all the same. You just dodge attacks and shoot at the glowing weak spot.\n-Some of the chapters drag a bit, forcing you into huge arenas with multiple waves of spawning enemies.\n-The combat in general starts to become a bit boring when you have first learned all the sword techiques and then learnt when and how to execute them. It starts to become a bit mundane when there is no new stuff to learn.\n\nIn conclusion it is in my opinion one of the best games of 2013, and it should not be overlooked.","December 12, 2013","true","13.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Allowing the player to  hack and slash body parts into pieces. The game doesn't like to take itself seriously like most shooters today and will occasionally throw funny jokes and easter eggs likely to make you stop and laugh. The dash system allows you to dash towards or away from the charging demons or fireballs raining from the sky.\nThe game begins with you and your sword which you will master as you progress. You slowly progress to different weapons as well as various attachments. This form of progression allows for you to fight the increasingly more difficult hordes of demons out to get you and left me interested in unlocking my next attachment or skill.\nThis game might not seem as good looking as crysis or metro but the atmosphere in levels like Lo Wang's (the main characters) secret cave or looking over the hills of the cemetery can leave you breathless.\nOverall I had a great time playing Shadow Warrior and I can easily recommend it to anyone.\n\nPROS:\nGraphics\nhumor\ngameplay\nlevel design\nprogression style\nCONS:\nOnly a semi-decent story\nonly 2-3 variants of enemy aesthetics per class\n(there should be some sort of looks randomizer to make it feel like you have sliced the same demon twice in a row.

A perfunctory examination indicates little promise; it looks and sounds like a pile of cliche: "ninja fights army of demons." On closer inspection however, Shadow Warrior is much more. I understand it's meant to be a callback to older shooters like Duke Nukem or Quake, titles which I never got to experience. Yet even without nostalgia, this game enthralled me despite its faults.\n\nThe gameplay has little variation; occaisional half-♥♥♥♥♥ puzzles always give way to more fighting, but thankfully that combat is far too fun to deride. The whimsically gratuitous carnage from carving through demon hordes with a spirit-laser firing katana is indescribably fun, and the initially lack-luster firearms can be upgraded to satisfying levels of destruction.\n\nWhile the storyline may be thin and unclear, the characters are engaging satires of modern cliches. Lo Wang and his questionable name make for healthy banter rather than the usual silence gravely grunts of self-insertion oriented shooters.\n\nAltogether Shadow Warrior is a must-play for any shooter fan, so long as one doesn't mind the occaisional slightly racist Wang pun.","December 20, 2014","true","16.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The combat is as satisfying as it is responsive and the katana's hit detection is probably the best i've ever seen in a video game (however special abilities are difficult to use at first), there is no weapon that you feel you won't like simply due to the fact that all of them have niche roles. The plot is interesting as well making mindless killing actually seem like your doing something meaningful however i won't talk too much about it due to spoilers. The game also has a surprisingly good sense of (especially considering the fact that the main character's name is essentially a ♥♥♥♥♥ joke). Lastly the world is absolutely beautiful (albeit it's no columbia from bioshock infinite)\n\nDispite all of that however, the game has a few game breaking AI glitches (like enemies hiding behind cover forever in a place the player can't reach) that make it impossible to advance due to the "kill everything to advance" system that only works if it's well placed in games like castle crashers. Also as i mentoned earlier the abilities are hard to use at first due to minor control issues and the exploration can get pretty boring when you just want to kill everything in sight but there's nothing for you to kill. Another thing to note is the unbareable load times, it's worse than dead rising 2 in this respect.\n\nOverall i'd reccomend this game to anyone who likes good stories, mindless killing, non-serious games and good humour but can tolerate a few downsides that prevent this game being perfect","December 23, 2013","true","42.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Happily, Polish developer Flying Wild Hog went back to the original and rather than slavishly remaking it, did a wonderful job in taking from it what worked and removing or radically re-imagining what didn't. The end result is a hectic, gorgeous-looking shooter in a classic style with just enough of a modern sensibility to make it feel fresh. The most crucial aspect of the game's success? It has what the classic '90s shooters had and what modern ones very rarely possess - personality.","December 10, 2013","true","22.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game is brutal in many ways, with one-liners reminding us of Duke Nukem. It’s a bit repetitive and some variation wouldn’t kill the mood. Overall it is a amazing game with a lot of blood and a great fighting system; good times and a cheap price. Fun gun/swordplay and fast paced action with exploration elements. Upgradeable weapons and sliceable enemies. Looking forward to more games from this developer.","July 15, 2014","true","8.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Based on the original Shadow Warrior, which was made in 1997 by 3D Realms (responsible for classics such as Duke Nukem 3D, Blood and Rise of the Triad), it's not really an re-make... more like a re-imagination, a re-boot.\n\nPlaying as Lo Wang, hired by Zilla Enterprise to help it's owner find the legendary Nobitsura Kage, a mystical katana connected to ancient demons. Aided by a spirit named Hoji, the player travels back and forth between the real world and the shadow realm to find the three parts of the sword and... yeah, that's about it when it comes to story.\n\nThe weapon of choice in this game is the katana, it's so satisfying to run around and chop all the different enemies to small pieces with the sharp katana. Sure, you've got some standard weapons like revolver, machine gun and rocket launcher and to make it all complete you even get to upgrade Lo Wang with different abilites and powers, which comes in handy while fighting wave after wave of demons.\n\nIt's GREAT fun and I think this is one of the best FPS games released in some years, it's not like Call of Duty and Battlefield and all that other stuff, it does its own thing and that's why everyone who enjoys the FPS genre should buy it and gives this a chance.","December 30, 2013","true","11.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The heavy melee focus sets it apart from similar games like Serious Sam or the Painkiller series, while you try to keep your distance from enemies in most shooters, here you will seek close contact much more often.\n\nThe levels are large and despite there being only one linear path to actually progress, there is always lots of secrets and pick-ups hidden in dark corners. Some might complain, that the lack of a mini-map or any kind of quest-marker makes it hard to know where to go sometimes, even when losing your way chances are high that you find at least something helpful or funny along the way.\n\nFun is something the game emphasizes a lot, the story is light, but the dialogs present range from cheeky to hilarious. There are three main settings, and the graphics are still great, especially the lighting is impressive throughout. Some bad textures and a couple of boring industrial areas in the second act dimish the overall good visual impression.\n\nThe only real downside to the game is the lack of enemy variety, since Shadow Warrior follows in Painkiller and Serious Sam’s footsteps of offering large scale battles and seemingly endless waves of enemies, there should be more enemy types to mix things up a bit better. As a result it is recommended to play this game not in long sessions but one or two levels a day. This way it keeps fresh and entertaining.\n\nPro:\n- fantastic swordplay\n- good variety of useful guns\n- Full of pop-culture jokes\n- solid upgrade system\n- beautiful lighting and settings\n\nCons:\n- not enough enemy variety\n- some boring levels\n- easy to get lost in the larger levels","December 22, 2014","true","20.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After the opening section of the game, weaker foes will fall before you with ease, but their tougher comrades aren't going to let you off the hook. However, this can be both a blessing and a curse.\n\nConstantly challenging enemies serve an important purpose in gaming: they keep the difficulty from dropping so low that the game ceases to be interesting. At the same time, however, this can lead you as a player to feel like you're never improving as you progress. Shadow Warrior unfortunately falls into this category from time to time. New sword techniques will always look and feel impressive when you first learn them, but eventually it will start to seem as though your enemies are shrugging them off with little effort.\n\nSimilarly, the gun combat sometimes feels downright neglected compared to the swordplay. There are weapon upgrades and a few relevant skills, but the absence of anything resembling gun-kata makes firearms feel like somewhat overgrown support tools rather than their own beasts.\n\nDespite the above criticism, however, Shadow Warrior is still a greatly entertaining experience. Although the guns aren't as interesting as the sword, few games allow you to slice and shoot quite as fluidly as this one.","December 23, 2014","true","11.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Remaking one of 3D Realms cult games while introducing a combat system which mixes FPS weapons, swords and magic powers is quite an achievement. Many studios have tried in the past to spice up the usual monotony of FPS encounters and failed horribly.\n\nSensitive with its classic roots, the game offers many secrets to discover in each level, very well known weapons like the shotgun or the rocket launcher. On top of that funny dialogues and situations help to ease the tension of the combats. In the 90's many FPS didn't take themselves too seriously so reliving some of that careless attitude is welcome here.\n\nAnother aspect which has been faithful to the classic FPS is the difficulty, prepare yourself to die a lot. This game is tough as nails, however, given the range of possibilities in combat  you will find yourself retrying the last encounter trying to find a better combination of weapons and powers that works better with your enemies. Actually, it makes it more satisfying when you finally wipe out a hellish horde of foes.\n\nTechnically the game runs great at 60 fps (some tinkering may be needed, look in the Steam Forums), offering lush sceneries with breathtaking landscapes.\n\nIn conclussion, Shadow Warrior remains throughout the game faithful to its classical roots while offering a very intense and rich combat. It has been one of most entertaining FPS I have played in years.","October 4, 2014","true","20.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And although this game is much easier than Hard Reset, it is still a decent specimen of old-school FPS genre, that is rare in modern times. Now to the main plot, unlike old Shadow Warrior this game has a really exciting story, literally it's a very good tale. And even Lo Wang is a big part of this story, he is not the major one. Hoji is a much more important figure. So to wrap up my review I want to say: highly recommended, especially if you like good tales and good old FPS.","June 24, 2014","true","63.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

Seriously, even if you don't play the game it's worth watching. The sense of humor seen in the intro pervades the entire game, although somewhat sparsely.  That brings me to my main issue with this game, which is something that Bioshock Infinite struggled with as well - having combat sequences occur far too frequently and last far too long. The gameplay involving sword fighting and combat in general are great, but the endless waves of enemies quickly grow tiring. The good parts of the game would shine much more if only the combat was cut down a bit.\n\nThe story has a strong hook in the beginning but I eventually found myself not caring much after running around on a wild goose chase.

Well written dialogue, a decent story, solid shooting, well done sound, incredible graphics and smooth game play make this a shooter that is worthy of the Shadow Warrior name as a reboot and if you like shooters this is one you should pick up.\n\nTL;DNR: 8.5: A humorous over the top shooter, tons of loot, hidden secrets, decent story, great action and solid game play with beautiful graphics make this a shooter for those with a sense of humor and desire for lots of combat. Sound is great, soundtrack is fitting and there is never a dull moment.\n\nTechnology/engine: 9: super smooth execution although a number of loading screens that are placed in such a way as to not be annoying and keeps the graphical fidelity high and controls responsive.\n\nAI: 8: Serviceable but a bit predictable but when the individual AIs of the mobs get mixed it gets intense and is enjoyable.\n\nGraphics: 10: Gorgeous sets, great character models, wonderful animations, great cut scenes and great use of 2D cut scenes for memories. Flying Hog deserves high marks for the graphics used in this game.\n\nSound: 8: Sound effects are well done but occasional source to reception issues can be found in the game that prevent you from spotting the source at a longer distance. Otherwise its a solid ambient soundscape that creates immersion and adds to the game.\n\nSoundtrack: 9: Great music throughout, I especially liked the unnerving heavy metal on the appearance of the black rabbit - one of the funniest and weirdly frightening moments that was totally unexpected in the game.\n\nVoice acting: 9: Solid cheesy delivery and poignant when needed or appropriate.\n\nCrafting: N/A\n\nCustomization: 9: Customization includes various powers, skills and weapon customization all of which are rewarding and make a difference in the game.\n\nGame play systems: 9: Really well mixed variety of weapons and abilities and the game scales with a difficulty spike if you are just ripping through. A number of the fights almost feel unfair until you find a technique to deal with the situation and the tools are always there.\n\nControls: 8: Slightly awkward controls that are occasionally unresponsive or do something other than what was intended - ie D-D-RMB is supposed to heal you but will occasionally perform the RMB function of the weapon - which can kill you of course. Perhaps when it comes out for consoles it will function better (although I hate to play shooters on console - prefer mouse and keyboard). Other than that it functions well.\n\nStory: 9: I was surprised at the quality of the story, the great use of humor and the still poignant tale that is weaved into over the top violence and silliness that really, somehow, works well.\n\nMultiplayer: N/A","July 14, 2014","true","25.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There is no multiplayer, but the campaign is stellar. Plays like an FPS from late 90's-early 2000's, but with modern functions (sprinting, leveling/character building, etc).\n\nCombat is phenomenal - between your katana, ki powers, pistol, SMG(s), crossbow, shotgun, flamethrower, rocket launcher, and demon bits (yes, you use pieces of demon as weapons. yes, it's as awesome as it sounds), combat is varied and exciting. There are probably an infinite number of ways you can approach any fight. The swordplay is pretty great - the lack of a parry  is a slight downer, but the ki powers make up for it.\n\nThe dialogue is drop-dead hilarious. Lo Wang's one-liners never get old, and the constant banter is what really gives this game its personality (IMO).\n\nThe story might be linear with not too many surprises, but if you can get by that and take this game for what it is (a throwback to late 90's shooters) you will enjoy yourself.\n\nThis is my first review ever, and until now I hadn't planned on writing one ever. Even at 10 hours (mine went a little longer after a bunch of avoidable deaths) for a playthrough, if I never played it again I think it's worth your money (or more, if you catch on a 75% off sale like I did).","April 10, 2015","true","11.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You're out for revenge (like all good ninjas), and you'll take it via lead and steel. The voice acting isn't the cartoony Chinese stereotype it was in the original, but the facepalmy oneliners still remain. The graphics are outstanding, with lighting effects, and spraying blood in every corner. The ragdoll physics are pretty good, and the coolest part of the gore-fest that is Shadow Warrior is that you can slice up foes Kill Bill style leaving a trail of gore and parts through out the numerous scenic temples and bamboo groves you traverse. A rough patch I'd say is the controls, which get a bit floaty with numerous enemies on screen, but they work. All in all, this isn't Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon or Ran, it is Rage of the Master or Hard Boiled and it does provide a thuroughly enjoyable bloody romp full of interesting enemies and scenic locations.\n\n*If you are basing your views on the thousands of years of diverse, rich cultures that encompass half of the world's population, on a (very tongue in cheek) game, then you are indeed a sad person and should probably log out, get out more.","June 23, 2014","true","2.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After playing the horrendously disappointing Duke Nukem Forever, I was fairly skeptical about this rebooted title.  At the very most, I was expecting a shallow FPS/FPK(First-Person Katana-ing) with decent action and an almost vacant story.  To be honest, I was surprised.  Shadow Warrior actually contains a story.  It's not particularly deep or engaging, but it is somewhat creative and the cutscenes were enjoyable.  The interaction between Lo Wang and the shadow realm demon Hoji ranged from annoying to hilarious, but I mostly enjoyed them poking fun at each other and taking cheap shots.  The action, however, was sublime - pure and simple.  Specifically, the katana was a pleasure to wield.  It sliced up demons and humans alike with noticable heft and precision.  The damage model for the enemies fit the game perfectly.  As the game progresses, new abilities for the katana and your "ki" powers are unlocked.  These range from a brutal thrusting strike from your katana to a shockwave-like burst of energy from your free hand.  During the game, you will wield a weapon in one hand and perform "ki" abilities with your other hand (think plasmids/vigors).  Unless you are dual-wielding akimbo style, this is the format for combat.  This opens up the possibility for numerous different attack combinations and variations.  In fact, the more varied and aggressive your combat style, the more karma points you are awarded after each encounter.  Karma is used to buy skill upgrades to further increase your skillset.\n\nWhile the katana is the staple of your arsenal, there are plenty of other weapons at your disposal, all of which feel solid and accurate.  Some are more effective than others, of course, but all have the ability to get the job done.  My only complaints about the weapons are that the fire-rate on some of them felt too slow and sometimes hitting the reload button prompted no response.  I would have to hit reload multiple times in order for the gun to actually reload.  The only reason that stands out so much is due to the rest of the controls being so responsive.  It wasn't a huge issue, but it was annoying at times.\n\nUltimately, this game was well worth a purchase, at least for me (sale for $11.99).  The in-house game engine produces some gorgeous visuals.  Texures look good, as do the lighting effects and the amount of color is refreshing.  No dull brown and greys here, well very little of that anyway.  That being said, I would have to recommend this title.  It's an action-packed romp that delivers on what it promises, unlike other certain titles (*cough* DNF *cough*).  I give Shadow Warrior 4 out of 5 bloody demon hearts.","June 23, 2014","true","52.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A lot of the gameplay style is fairly old-school "keep-on-moving-and-don't-stop" with fairly open levels (yes there is cover, but things like cars will work as much against you as for you if you're not careful), AI that isn't that intelligent (often comes straight at you and only tries to flank at the last moment) and generally not so secret secrets (providing you take the time to explore the whole map.)\n\nFor the more modern player, you have the choice of whether/how to upgrade weapons, skills or even your katana abilities which gives quite a bit of flexibility in how you play. You can also use much of the scenery as a weapon e.g. roll barrels down a hill and shoot at them to make them explode or fire at abandoned vehicles to take out large groups at once.\n\nMy biggest irritation is the inability to fathom what's safe and what's not as there seems no consistency in how scenery is treated. e.g. on some maps, you won't find secrets unless you go for a swim whereas on others if you dip one toe in the water it's instadeath. You'll find yourself dying an awful lot more than you should if you have an inquisitive nature as a result.\n\nAs a player of the original I also miss the old Lo Wang accent, but the fact there are less of the cheesy one-liners is probably a good thing in this day and age. It's also more than made up for by the fortune cookies and their contents.\n\nThe whole is something which is neither completely old or new and somehow manages to get away with being enough of both that it should appeal. Well worth a go if you haven't yet.","July 10, 2014","true","9.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Infact, if played at highest difficulty, you will have a hard time remaining alive while facing hordes of demons.\n\nTo help your slaughter you will find weapons of any sort and also will develop a set of skills that will aid you in combat: unique looking katana special moves that tear apart all the stupid demons surrounding you, generate wave of energy that spread from your blade and kills from distance, powerful blows that overcomes any protection and some defensive skills too, like healing and a ki-energy shield.\nThe skills are a lot and during the course of the game you will have to make choices because you don't have enough ability points to take them all.\n\nThe graphics is good and deep-customizable but some of the uber effects are really heavy on the GPU and CPU, so in the most populated encounters the framerate fluctuate a bit too much.\n\nOverall is a fantastic fun game that's worth buying and playing, especially if you can grab it while on-sale!\n\n","April 24, 2015","true","17.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Hundreds of enemies thrown at you at once for your almighty blade to slice into multiple pieces. There are also many guns to be used, abused and upgraded which are also very amusing to use. The ranking system after every battle is also a neat system that encourages you to go back and 5 star every map.

The shooting is well done, with the action keeping a fast, flowing pace throughout. The weapons aren't as fun as some of the old style shooters, however, they're all fairly bland, with the katana being the most fun to use. The swordplay is surprisingly visceral, although you will sometimes slice through an enemy and almost nothing will happen, the enemies more often are either sliced to pieces, or react as if they had been hit by an actual sword. The story is coherent and interesting enough to keep the game together, but it's so tonally different from the gameplay that it often pushes you out of the experience. The two main characters do have a nice back-and-forth, with some of their dialogue actually making me laugh. The enemies however, get a bit repetitive, you fight the same 6 or 7 enemies during the entire game, and in the last few chapters, it finally gets a bit too repititive, and the combat stops being fun almost completely. The bosses are also fairly boring, Shadow Warrior doing the big impressive boss thing that telegraphs their attacks so far in advance you'd think they were trying to let you win, with the amount of health and ammo scattered around during these fights, they're just too easy. The ending is also a bit disappointing.\n\nTL;DR: A fun rush of slightly repetitive violence with an okay story and a couple of interesting characters.\n\nEdit: It's also fairly pretty.","December 26, 2014","true","12.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Slapstick humour mixed with semi serious tones makes for a fun story if a bit grating towards the end. Sticks to the "annoying enemy" cliché of arcade shooters with shrieking teleporting katana women, large necromancers that summon enemies and then cast shields around themselves and berserkers who can only be damaged from the back. There are sequences when multiple enemy types are thrown at you, which can really test your patience, so be prepared for that. Finally the hit detection feels slightly off, particularly in the boss battles. Regardless, a good experience overall.","January 3, 2015","true","9.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Linear story but there's a lot of reward for going off path and exploring.  The story is good and has some plot twists but the real amusment comes from the main characters snarky commentary.  Is always vulgar though so if you're easily offended by that then this may not be for you.   The weapon choices, and enhancements along with skill and power purchases make it fairly customizable and no weapon (aside from the flamethrower for me but even that can get a grenade launcher attachment) feels left out.  Enemy diversity isn't great but it isn't bad either.  The combinations of enemy encounters that they throw at you does escalate well and never feels too rediculous.

It's a cool mechanic but come on, you can't enjoy killing anyone because you have to always be aware of them charging you. And the classic mistake of giving you the coolest guns to enjoy for like a minute and it's done. The progress in games should give you cool mechanics and toys half or 2/3 of the game through so you can enjoy the time with them, here - sadly - it's not the case. It's a really good game tho, one of the best combat systems in modern games.","December 30, 2013","true","16.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The way enemies blow up or get cut into pieces is so satisfying to watch that it never got old throughout my entire playthrough.\n\nI'll have to mention, that the cutscenes and animations were great and quite enjoyable. It is rare to see a "comic book" style cutscene done so well.\n\nGameplay:\nThis has to have been one of the most satisfying FPS experience I had in ages. The guns felt brutal and the swordplay is just amazing. The fact, that you can dismember your enemies in so many ways is quite joyful and gives style.\n\nNot only, this game has interesting weapons, but Ki powers which add quite a punch to the main character.\n\nStory:\nAlthough the story is quite simple, I did enjoy it. The characters are a blast and fun to watch talk, argue and taunt each others.\n\nConclusion:\nThis game is for anyone who wants a visceral FPS with alot of action and some somewhat raunchy humour.

Most times I don't even bother with the sparse selection of guns because it's so much more satisfying to play with the game's simple combo system of pressing a directional key twice and then left or right mouse to use a sword attack or special move that knocks down or immobilizes enemies. Chaining together combinations will give you more points to use in a XP system for more moves, but will also make it more likely enemies will power-up themselves. It's a nice on the fly difficulty curve.\n\nThe original game was notorious for being borderline racist thanks to the protagonist Lo Wang's broken English quips. That's been thankfully cut out and replaced with some genuinely funny back-and-forths between Lo and a mask-wearing demon who follows him. And even better, a reoccurring joke fans of a certain Monty Python movie will love.\n\nThere is very little I can fault this game for – the shooting and sword-fighting is awesome, it looks nice, the difficulty feels just right, it's more violent than Peter Jackson's Dead Alive, it's hilarious, and there's a new game plus mode so you can max out Lo's skills and weapon upgrades.\n\nFPS of the year 2013 right here folks.","December 18, 2013","true","23.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Shifting around the battlefield slicing up enemies with a magic katana couldn't have been executed better than in this game, though I wished there was more enemy variety.

Somehow you can hear bullets impacting in enemies that are a hundred meters away, and other sounds are nothing special.\n\nOverall, I recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of shooters like Serious Sam and anyone who likes games with swords, like Chivalry or even Skyrim.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/paulball5/recommended/233130/","paulball5","Zombait","http://steamcommunity.com/id/paulball5/","350 products in account","Shadow Warrior is a reimagining of the classic first person shooter by 3D Realms in 1997. The Story is a prequel to the original game. You play as Lo Wang who is ordered by his boss Orochi Zilla to get a sword known as the Nobitsura Kage. However obtaining this sword is easier said than done since you attacked by an assortment of demons on your journey. You are helped along the way by a demon named Hoji who tells you the sword is capable of slaying immortals and is anathema to demons. The dialogue between both Lo Wang and Hoji is extremely good and makes a lot of references to certain films and video games. The story is ok but nothing to brag about, it keeps the game going whilst telling a few jokes but it’s mostly forgettable.\n\nIf you were expecting it to be an old school shooter then you aren’t going to find this game. Instead you go from arena to arena fighting enemies and being scored. It can be more easily compared to Painkiller than any other franchise. You have a choice of nine weapons. Some make their return from the original game such as the sword and sub machinegun and some new weapons such as the crossbow and a double barrel shotgun. The sword is the best weapon in the game since it’s extremely responsive, visceral, powerful and just plain fun to use. The guns, whilst feeling underpowered at first do hold themselves up one you upgrade them by using the in-game currency which is just known as ‘money’.  The upgrades vary from giving you a larger magazine size too having awesome ones like upgrading your double barrel shotgun into a quad barrel shotgun. There are also certain skills you can acquire to give you more health, money, ammo, a new weapon, new moves with your sword and many more. Finally there are four powers in the games which vary such as healing two thirds of your hp, knocking enemies back, launching enemies into the air and making a shield to protect yourself. Each power can be upgraded to make them more useful in combat.\n\nThe enemies in the game vary from demons running at you and attacking you, protecting themselves with shields whilst shooting fireballs, flying in the air whilst shooting fireballs, rolling green goo and have it explode in your face and many more. You can also pick up body parts from demons such as their hearts which kill some of the enemies which surround you. There are also human enemies too but there extremely weak and don’t become a real threat until the last few chapters in the game.\n\nThe graphics are pretty good, there are a lot of different locations such as small towns too snowy mountains which all look great. The atmosphere and lighting effects are good throughout each level and fit the overall theme of the game.\n\nShadow Warrior is an extremely good game. Sure it doesn’t have a very good story and it’s not old school either but the gameplay keeps you engaged and makes you want to carry on playing the game. Highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of first person shooters.","March 31, 2014","true","21.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not a single moment in the game let down once, absaloute perfection!\nGuns are great, good variety of enemies, gameplay is solid and addictive, story is unforgettable and immersive!\n\n\n--[TLDR Warning]--\n(Longer review)\n\nWhere to begin...\n\nShadow Warrior has pretty much everything I want and love. The scenery and settings are gorgeous. The gameplay is smooth and fluent throughout and never gets old or boring too quickly. Infact at all. The game doesn't give you any "here's a ridiculous and pointless puzzle as a filler to make the game longer". It's level after level of onslaught, story and exploration. The story is by far the most impressive and best thing about the game. With some games, the story can totally suck and you feel you just want to get through it and finally complete it. But Shadow Warriors story really is unique and different. It keeps on point all the time and doesn't slow down or make the game crap. Having completed the game, the story is absaloutely beautiful. The characters are unforgettable, the weapons are glorious, the melee combat is by far the best swordplay of any game I've played with the feature, and mostly what I love the most - it's a long game!\n\nThe weapons. The weapons are awesome to use. At first you may notice they feel a bit... weak. But with future upgrades they feel better and look cooler. Your arsenal will build up from a revolver, smg, crossbow to a shotgun, flamethrower, and rocket launcher. But it doesn't stop there - there's an ability to use Demon hearts and heads against foes for a gruesome but fun attack method. If that doesn't settle, there's always the swordplay which you yield gracefully in the face of combat with some amazing and deadly combos!\n\nThe enemies have some great variety and change the gameplay drastically. You'll fight common lesser demons for nearly all of the game but you'll run into bigger and more challenging foes, all inwhich have different tactics and attack methods making each encounter a new and fresh experience. You'll come across flying demons, sheilded greater demons, beserkers and more. Oh and did I mention the boss fights?! Boss fights are epic, with giant bosses and huge arenas!\n\nThe gameplay is fun and addicting, when playing through this - I was personally playing it at 4-5 hour sessions. Which I usually don't do with most games. The story cuts in frequently but it never ruins anything good or slows the game down in a bad way. The characters are great and you get a real feel for each characters personality. Filled with quirky humour and some humerous stereotypes, this game is just so good.\n\nI highly reccomend Shadow Warrior to fans of swordplay/sword fighting, japanese related culture, or truely awesome FPS action!\n\nI rate this game a strong 10/10","June 14, 2015","true","19.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's an attempt to bring the fun of games like Doom or Duke Nukem 3D into the modern age.  Frankly, I'll always like that style of FPS versus the more modern types with limited weapons and complicated cover systems.\n\nA special not about the best weapon in the game, the katana.  If you're one of these people who goes through a game crowbarring or wrenching everyone to save ammo, you'll love this game's treatment of the katana, probably the best melee weapon I've seen in this type of  FPS, they really put a lot of thought into it.  I'll note, however, there is also a good selection of upgradable firearms and special weapons, and plenty of ammo for them.\n\nAlso, the environments are very pretty and colorful, mostly.  This may seem like not a big deal, but I find it helps differentiate this game from a lot of modern FPSs.\n\nI find the main characters (the hero gets a ghostly sidekick) to be very appealing.  He's funny and tough.  The ghostly sidekick is appropriately sarcastic.\n\nWell, for me this was pretty much a must buy, so I highly recommend it.","June 12, 2015","true","10.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

You can backtrack through pretty much every level, so you never feel railroaded into what the designers want you to do. Even though there’s no real point to it, I love the destruction. It’s an incredibly long game too, took me more than 25 hours for completion. I would never have expected such a deep skills system, but it becomes worth investing into when later on the game just dumps every enemy variety, gigantic or minute, onto you. The tougher the game gets (played on Hard difficulty), the more you’ll be switching out different sword specials, guns, and even demon heart/heads like a multitasking maniac.\n\nBeyond the gameplay and design that respects the player, it’s probably the funniest game I played in 2013. Great tongue-in-cheek references, fourth-wall breaking, hipster jokes, ironic fortune cookies, one-liners, and a well-developed love/hate relationship between Lo Wang and Hoji that becomes surprisingly emotional towards the end.","February 7, 2014","true","26.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Controls are tight, combat is fastpaced and the game runs smoothly at high framerate for me. Looks great on ultra if you can manage it! Flying Wild Hogs hit it out of the park with this reboot after cutting their teeth on Hard Reset. A shame the 73 metacritic score will turn some away from it. Don't hesitate to nab this game next time you see it on sale. The Soundtrack is also quite engrossing and badass, so get the deluxe edition if you can swing it.

The direction on the humor is stronger than the delivery, and I think the same thing can be said for the gameplay.  The sword is definitely the most enjoyable weapon they have, and completely overwhelms most early encounters, until you get to specials that basically say 'change it up or get killed'.  Attacks, both delievered and received, feel like they lack weight, making it feel more arcade-y than I think really served it well.  The secrets are really well hidden, and sometimes things that are secret easter eggs...aren't counted as secrets?  Despite often spending quite a while on each level searching, I found I rarely got more than a couple of them per level.  I didn't jive with the combat well, and I don't think the game did a great job of communicating what it wanted out of the player (It was rare early on to get as many as 4 stars for a fight, even when barely touched and using lots of moves, leaving me feeling like I was playing poorly, even when continuing to win repeatedly)\n\nI may go back to this later, but at the moment pausing after raising an eyebrow at inconsistent reaction to water (Sometimes it does nothing, sometimes it kills you).  I wouldn't say this is a bad game, since it's not, but I think it's kind of average.  If you enjoy corny humor, it's got that in spades, and while the delivery doesn't back it, the writing is pretty solid in offering it.","February 22, 2014","true","6.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Happily, Polish developer Flying Wild Hog went back to the original and rather than slavishly remaking it, did a wonderful job in taking from it what worked and removing or radically re-imagining what didn't. The end result is a hectic, gorgeous-looking shooter in a classic style with just enough of a modern sensibility to make it feel fresh. The most crucial aspect of the game's success? It has what the classic '90s shooters had and what modern ones very rarely possess - personality.","December 10, 2013","true","22.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

NOW!\nThis game is freakin' awesome!\n\nOk... since you're already here, I'm tellin' ya why reading this is a waste of time, when you could already start playing one of the finest games developed in 2013 (or was it 2014? well who cares...?).\n\nIt's a good old run-and-gun-(and-hack-and-slay)-shooter, that doesn't want you cowering behind some kind of convenient placed barrier, from where you can calmly shoot your enemies one by one. Instead you're forced to stay in motion. Otherwise the enemie's projectiles will kill you faster than a dive into a volcano...\nYou're slicing thousands of demons with your Katana, u're nailing them to the wall with ur crossbow (Painkiller and F.E.A.R. send their regards), u're burning them with your flame thrower until they scream in agony and then you blow'em to pieces with ur 4-barreled shotgun (it has 4 barrels after u've upgraded it (which you should)). It's bloody and gory and soooo rewarding and satisfying in doing so. In addition to this u gain some magic powers. For example you'll be able to let your foes float defenseless in the air for a very few seconds, so you can shoot them like they were some kind of "meat pinatas" as LoWang states, when u're using this power.\n\nThe story is maybe a little convuluted but nevertheless very interesting. It's also presented in a very beautiful way: while the present (which is appearantly the late eighties or early nineties) is shown directly in ingame cutscenes (95% from your point of view), the backstory is presented in some kind of 3D cartoon.\n\nIt's a very fine crafted single player (only) shooter that'll keep you longer on your toes, than those average 5-hour-hogwash-pseudo-military-shooters... It took me roughly 20 hours to complete the campaign (the first time).\n\nThe only thing I regret, is the fact, that I bought it when it was on sale. I didn't want to pay the full price for a remake of a nineties game after I had to suffer through travesties like DNF. Flying Wild Hog deserves better though. I would have been happier, if I would have paid the full price. Gearbox should take note on how to make proper old school games.\n\nNow buy the game already!","January 23, 2015","true","47.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","1"

Plenty of upgrades, giving you lots of freedom to choose to how you want to power up. Lots of content too 17 levels and the levels aren't that short. Tons of secrets and amusing hidden easter eggs to find. Very nostalgic but at the same time very modern, for example the fact that nearly every little object in the game is destructible. The way the story is presented is a huge improvement on how it was handled in this dev's previous game, Hard Reset, and it's great fun to hear the banter between Lo Wang and the demon Hoji.

The basic idea: A man gets drawn into the conflict between demon lords and in pursuit of a legendary sword gets the power to not only save his world, but to also change the fate of their shadowy realm.\nThere are a couple of nice looking comic sequences in which the background story is revealed piece by piece, where your sometimes a bit annoying companion becomes a more interesting character over time. Not bad!\n- Combat System: Fast and responsive. Melee is a big component and you unlock different swordstrikes over time. You have some magic spells (healing, stun, damage) and some enemies require different tactics.\n- Character System: You have three areas to improve; skills, magic and weapons. Each require a different currency to unlock. There certainly is some room for individual choices so it's not just a feature without purpose.\n- Presentation/Physics: Even two years after release, the game is still looking well enough. Enemies can be cut to pieces, burned or pushed away, some objects can be broken. The weapons feel strong and give a good impression of power in the game world.\n- Sound/Music: Just well made. Weapons and enemies sound good, music is decent - a few tracks with asian or jazz influence are even good. Can't complain.\n- Humour: It didn't make me break down laughing and did not send my sides into orbit. But still, the occasional Wang joke or light hearted comment was certainly good to keep the spirits high during the more repetitive moments of the game.\n- Hidden extras: Join the old-school fun when looking for the most inconspicuous places. Exploration is well rewarded with money (for weapons) and an XP like currency for skills. Contains some references to the original game aswell.\n- Difficulty: The highest setting "insane" felt just right for me as an experienced gamer. Enemies are dangerous and you have to be on your toes not to be surrounded my smaller minions or charged to death by the dreaded berserkers. Still, quicksave and the manual healing ability make every fight winnable. Even though you spend some time each fight just running away and healing yourself it still feels way better than those auto healing mechanics.\n\n+-\n- Weapons: Nothing really creative or particulary interesting. Katana, Revolver, SMG, Crossbow, Shotgun, Flamethrower, Rocket Launcher, Demon Heart, Demon Head. Each weapon can undergo at least one interesting change via upgrade.\n- Level design: Almost a negative point, if not for some beautiful places and those sometimes well hidden extras.\nEvery now and then you re-visit areas that look very similar to other ones. Could be more diverse. Most fights have an arena like feeling where enemies are spawning until you've killed them all and the door to the next area opens.\n- Enemies: Nicely designed, some require special tactics. They get repetitive over time though. A plus are the big boss battles, although they all play VERY similar. Cool design though.\n- Characters: Not many interesting characters, which only develop over time. Doesn't take itself too seriously though, which avoids mindnumbing stereotypes.\n\n-\n- Repetitiveness: Consider this as a huge point. Some areas really feel drawn out, thanks to the arena fights and repetitive level design. There have been a couple of places where I was plain bored.\n- Bugs: I fell through the floor a couple of times and you can die when dashing down stairs. Minor annoyance.\n\n\n\nMy perspective\nI've been pursuing this hobby since the mid 90s. My favorite genres are Strategy games, RPGs and (increasingly less) FPS. I also enjoy the occasional platformer, adventure or other indi game.\nI like competitive elements in online games, but without the social component of hanging out with friends I'd often prefer offline titles.\n\n","August 31, 2015","true","16.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The satisfaction the Katana brings is just amazing. SW has set the bar for fast melee combat.\n+ Beautiful graphics, screenshots abound here. Fantastic amount of PC options for graphics, sound and gameplay.\n+ Great variety of satisfying weapons and enemies.

Everything around you is a freaking deathtrap if you're not careful.\n+ Very nice blend of horror, thriller, suspense and action.\n\nNow for the cons.\n\n- The head and weapon bobbing makes me a little nauseous. I wish there was an option to turn that off.\n- The lighting in some are blinding and frustrating to navigate to.\n- Some of the control schemes just don't make sense to me. Like the regeneration skill. Constantly pushing "D" makes you move while healing, which can be convenient at times but there are some cases where you don't want to go in the direction you're trying to heal yourself in.\n- Motion blur is going to make me sick. I'm normally used and accustomed to FPS games  but this one just makes me wanna puke after playing for hours for some reason, something that most FPS games do not induce on me.\n- The death count: Seriously, don't be like GTA or other games that reminds players how many times they messed up in the game. I'm a perfectionist so I had to delete my old save data just to start fresh and go for a no death run.\n- There are times where Wang is just trying too hard to be funny. The accent is a little bit thick for an asian too.\n- Lo Wang is not even a japanese name. I don't know Wang's backstory but when I started the game, I assumed he was Japanese. If so, disregard this.\n- Experienced my first death when I misread the health number and thought it read 12 when it actuallity, it was written as "92". I panicked and ran all over the place, got mobbed and died.\n\nOverall, my score for this game is an honest 8/10.\n\nWill try to shoot vending machine and dying again.","August 16, 2015","true","11.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Diologue is witty and precise, self referencial and bizzare. It may be said that the maps are generic (as are the enemies), but it's wrapped up smoothly with smooth and easy to use gameplay and controls that makes cutting through hordes of identical demons a thing of joy. I would recommend having a higher end computer (there's only so many blood particles a proccessor can handle), but the game is still functional with minimum  requirements. In short, the game has a few flaws, but with a little work it could easily become a classic, something our generation of games very badly needs. 8/10","December 31, 2013","true","19.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game isn't going to win awards for deep and nuanced characters any time soon, but as far as clever dialogue and witty banter go, this one's a winner.\n\n-The swordplay in this game is what the combat in all of the Elder Scrolls games SHOULD have been, but wasn't. Your katana isn't just for when you run out of ammo - it's as useful and verstaile a weapon as any of the projectile weapons at your disposal.\n\n-This game isn't just for b-movie fans with a love for crude humor and blood. The humor may *look* kind of sophomoric and racist out of context, but the game has very smart writing and it's willing to poke fun at itself. Most of the jokes in the trailers that seem crude or insensitive are actually, when viewed in context, a meta-commentary on the very humor the game it utilizing.\n\n-The pop culture humor is perfect. It's clever and gives you sense of shared culture with the protagonist, rather than being heavy-handed and making you feel like you're being pandered to. It's Dungeons of Dredmor humor (hooray!), not Randal's Monday humor (blech).\n\n-If you buy it at $40, you're getting your money's worth. If you manage to find it discounted to $5 like I did, you're basically stealing $35 of fun.","January 5, 2015","true","17.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a series of semi-technical combat 'arenas' in which you need to choose your weapons and tactics carefully so as not to be overwhelmed, joined together by explore-and-lewt sections, but Shadow Warrior seems to pull it all together a lot better than other games of the same ilk. The story is.. just ok.. for the majority of the game, but it rounds it out and sets the mood well enough to make it feel as though you have a purpose beyond go-there-kill-everything-repeat.\n\nNot that that would be a big problem - the combat is immensely satisfying, with the game offering a large variety of ways to blow up, burn, electrify, perforate, and slice and dice the reasonably varied set of lesser and greater demons that you'll run into. You always have a few options on how to tackle a given situation, and throughout the game you'll be upgrading your sword skills, Chi powers, and less-up-close-and-personal weaponry to increase them.\n\nThe game also features a few boss battles which, although a little samey, make for a nice change of pace from the frantic melee of the rest of the game.\n\nHard difficulty recommended if you're a regular fps player - the difficulty paces pretty well, and by the time you're hitting the stiffer challenges of the later levels you should be good enough to whoop them if you've invested a bit of time in hunting down some of the secret xp-stashes that are lying about. Learn the special moves and make sure you've got your dodge key bound and you'll be kicking demon backside.\n\nTLDR; had a blast - play this if you like to chop things up with a sword while listening to corny 'wang' jokes.\n\nLO WANG / 10","May 24, 2015","true","20.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It brings back the feeling of old-school shooters like the classic Duke Nukem games. No waist-high cover shooting here. You'll be running and gunning against hordes of demons, all of which can be reduced into tiny chunks via katana, bullets, or explosives. Speaking of explosives, if you like killing enemies using the environment you will be very happy to know that there are plenty of explosive barrels, arcade machines, lamps, generators, etc. Another welcome classic shooter feature is secrets. Those who wander off the beaten path will find helpful items as well as retro areas that are a throwback to the classic Shadow Warrior game.\n\nIt's not just an old-school shooter with a fresh coat of paint though. There's quite a bit of character progression via skill and power upgrades, and all weapons have purchaseable upgrades, some of which make a fairly normal guns into something quite a bit more ludicrous.\nThere's also a system where each encounter is rated based on how stylishly you murder the waves of demons in an area. You get points via a score system similar to Bulletstorm's. Kills attained with different weapons and different methods will earn you a variety of bonuses. And the bonus you get goes toward upgrading your skills, so it pays to go for skillshots.\nThe health system is an interesting hybrid. It doesn't have regenerative health like many modern shooters, but it isn't soley a health-pickup system either. You have a demonic power to regenerate your health, but it's not passive. You have to activate it yourself and it only heals up to 65% of your max HP. Skills and powers can change how effective it is, but they can also improve what you get out of health pickups.\n\nMost surprising though is how good this game looks. I wasn't expecting much since it's not a AAA release, but some of the effects and environments are really nice to look at. Another surprise is that there's actually a pretty decent plot amongst all the demon slaying. It's delivered in bits through chats with your demon buddy, and through above average quality animatics. In general there are a lot of little details that didn't really need to be there. Pressing the reload button with a full magazine plays a cool little animation, and a lot of insignificant items in the world are fully destructable.\n\nThe game has a good sense of humor too, and I enjoyed playing a shooter that didn't take itself too seriously. There are many wang jokes to be had, and the conversations between the main character and his snarky demon sidekick are pretty entertaining. The fortune cookies scattered throughout the levels all contain amusingly absurd messages too.\n\nAll in all, if you are sick of modern military shooters and want an over-the-top shooter where the final weapon in your arsenal is a rocket launcher, this is the game for you.","September 12, 2014","true","15.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There's plenty of weapon upgrades which add everything from dual wielding to explosive rounds for your firearms. In addition, two skill trees are available which focus on improving your healing abilities, movement, luck, katana mastery and defensive and offensive Chi powers, such as knockdown stuns and damage reduction blocking. There's a great amount of variation here for character building.\n+ Very engaging combat for the most part, keeping you on your toes. There's several different types of enemies - standard demons, warlords, shamans, berserkers, flying demons plus others.\n+ Hidden secrets to find for those who enjoy a bit of exploration, along with the often amusing fortune cookies.\n+ Graphics are absolutely fine considering the obvious low budget for the game. It's clear Shadow Warrior is not a triple A game so stunning visuals shouldn't be expected. It's decent and that's all it needs to be.\n+ The game takes a good 15-20 hours to finish, which is not too bad for an FPS, hack 'n' slash style title.\n\n\nNegatives:\n\n- Weak story, limited dialogue, somewhat hard to follow. Very linear for the most part.\n- Some non-sensical environmental mechanics, cars explodes by throwing shurikens at them, or a few bullets. Fighting is very arcade-like and lacks realism.\n- Really tedious and boring boss encounters, which can take 20-30 minutes per battle (hard difficulty). Often they're not that hard, just time consuming and annoying.\n\nOverall Score: 7/10\n\nShadow Warrior is a nice, action packed game to pass the time. It has an acceptable amount of content for a cheap price (especially on sale) so it's well worth it.","June 3, 2015","true","21.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/evilTak/recommended/233130/","evilTak","Tak!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/evilTak/","234 products in account","Shadow Warrior caught me completely off guard.\nI hadn't heard much about it when it was released in 2013, and I hadn't really played the original from the 90s either, so when I acquired it as part of Humble Indie Bundle 14, it went onto my I'll play this when I get around to it list.\n\nI eventually did get around to playing it - within the first five minutes, I was completely hooked, and this quickly became one of my favorite shooters.\n\nShadow Warrior is a story-oriented, first-person shooter in which you play Lo Wang, a corporate enforcer. The game begins as Wang is tasked with completing a straightforward purchase of an antique katana. Wang immediately sets the tone for the game by making cracks about the seller's henchmen and the cliché nature of the cherry-blossoms-plus-koi-ponds setting.\n\nThe combat system for the game is crisp and refreshing. Not only does Wang acquire a standard complement of FPS weapons as he progresses, he's also armed with shurikens and a katana. Via a pair of skill trees, one based on "karma" (XP) and the other based on "Ki crystals" that the player can occasionally locate, Wang can learn special combinations (e.g. forward-forward-attack) that allow him to supercharge his katana attacks, immobilize nearby enemies, or even partially heal himself. These combos add a dimension of depth and challenge to combat that helps to keep it interesting and intense throughout the game.\n\nThe level design is elegant and well-thought-out, directing the player without making her feel boxed-in and giving her the freedom to explore while still making it clear how to progress. The player is often forced to double back or cross her earlier path, but there's never that feeling of having to trudge back and forth across an area, and there are often new surprises waiting in areas that have been previously visited.\n\nThe story is engaging but not heavy-handed. It's there to provide context for events and motivation to the player and the character, but the focus is definitely on the action - control isn't ripped away from the player every thirty seconds to show a cutscene or an on-rails sequence. The game is filled with comedic moments, and there's a steady stream of genuinely witty (not just "video game" witty) commentary from Wang that kept a grin on my face as I blasted and slashed.\n\nThe Linux port was very well done. I played from beginning to end on Ubuntu 15.04, and the game runs flawlessly on my aging Macbook Pro. It took me about 19 hours to complete the game on normal difficulty, with a moderate amount of exploration and a few retried battles.\n\nIf you like old-school action shooters, Shadow Warrior should be at the top of your to-play list!","June 3, 2015","true","20.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While melee is clearly the weapon of choice, eventually, guns become not only viable, but rather fun, once you get their more ridiculous upgrades like a quad barrel shotgun and exploding crossbow bolts, but for the large part you will be making like Butcher Pete and hacking enemies to pieces, even the sub-bosses.","December 2, 2013","true","9.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Pick it up if you are after something a bit more old school.\n\nA pretty game with smart level design and mechanics. Flying Wild Hog have clearly learnt from Hard Reset, this time doing away with the flaky weapon system and adding some cool melee and spellcasting mechanics to add some variety.\n\nThe awesome (but lighthearted) setting really adds a lot to the game, and improves a lot upon the dark and boring generic not-really-cyberpunk sci-fi theme from Hard Reset. Some talented artists have been given an opportunity to flex their muscles here, with some truly spectacular art (especially in the first level).\n\nThe melee and spell based combat system is nice, despite some strange key combinations needed to access them. The ability to heal means the game doesn't leave you stuck without enough health if you've missed a few health packs, but can remove some of the tension from combat. The melee system is nice and fits in well with the guns. You learn new moves as you progress, so tedium is avoided. But it can make guns feel less useful.\n\nLevels can still feel very boxed in and limited compared to games like Serious Sam, and many of the secrets tend to be pretty boring. The guns can lack the authentic feel and kick you might be familiar with.\n\nBut otherwise, Shadow Warrior is a good effort at making more of an old school feeling FPS, with skill based, bombastic combat making up for most of the failings.","May 20, 2015","true","6.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But after first bloodbaths I went deeper...\nI never expected any deep lore from this kind of slashers, just "hey, this is big evil guy, we must destroy him by slaying one milion of smaller evil guys!". Shadow Warrior storyline could be in first approach something like that, but I think, that everyone who reccomend this game also was supprised how deep is the story and how big is immersion. Ending scene just makes me...I don't even have a world, just how game ends its amazing.\nGame is hard itself. I have the moment, when i just slashed everything like I am a god, but later game became more and more challenging when you are surronded by every type of enemies. Still its not broken, its ballanced and even more fun when encounters force on you to use every weapon, every skill and many time the enviroment! It's not a shame to play on easier diffulty, I played on normal and still it Was a challange to me.\nEnemies are varied, but game don't throw on us every type on the beginning. Some of them we can meet in the beginning, but others in the middle/slow endgame. They are realy different from eachself and force on player to use also other tactic to single one. Everyone played their role on battlefield and every demon we encounter doing something realy different, for example support his allies or summon other minion (but also still hurting us badly). Later game mix often almost all types, and from autopsy I can said this - In this game, more is better. You need to think many times to survive in bloodshed.\nSkills and equipment are satisfying. Many weapon, which every have their own advantages and cons, which makes every usefull. Upgrades maybe makes one more universal, but still not an ultimate massacre machine. You can see it especially in endgame, where its bloodbath overload. More interesing are skills, merits of swordfighting. I use katana almost everytime I can, so I can say that its created perfectly. I never felt that I need some other skill instead that i can use, same as perks.\nI fully recomend this game. Its awesome, one of the best production of 2014, maybe in whole gaming history. Entartaining and challanging.\nOnly one con is that you can finish this game in max. 15 hours, but content loaded in this makes me fully satisfied.","July 2, 2015","true","15.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Boy do I regret not jumping on it at that time. Apart from a few dull puzzles and platforming sections, It`s definitely one of my favourite FPS game of 2013.\n\nThe sheer fun this game offers to someone who is a fan of anything Serious Sam -or Painkiller-esc. is insane. You get to carry up to 9 (if i remember correctly) weapons simultaneously, with slots 8 & 9  being hearts and skulls picked from enemies you encounter. The gunplay feels really visceral and the upgrade system is perfect for a "shoot-em-up" game like this. Do you like killing tons of demons with swords or with tight gunplay? - Then this is the game for you.\n\nBut the strongest parts of this game comes in the shape of:\n- Art direction - beautiful use of colors and Asian influenced set pieces and nature\n- Katana sword-play\n- PC features such as FOV slider which goes up to 120 if you so desire, a whole slew of neat    graphics options and no mouse accel. or smoothing. ("Praise the lord!")\n\nI will go out on a limb here and say that I have never been this pleasantly surprised when it comes to the feel and handling of a sword in an FPS setting. The feeling when you slice up demons and execute the katana special moves is unmatched in anything I`ve played earlier. The fast-paced movement system allows for you to feel like an actual ninja in first person view, dashing in and out of combat slicing up demons. It also opens up for you to "kite" enemies around just like in Serious Sam and Painkiller, which is a feature I especially appreciate during battles in the more open arena-style settings the game has to offer.\n\nI really liked the story for what it was, and it takes you on a fun ride through a variety of different locations and offers a good variety in scenery, even if its somewhat stretched through backtracking and puzzles. The characters are fun, and early on you get to meet a really fun and excellently voice acted side character that will follow you throughout the game.\n\nThe humor in this game Is something I really enjoy, even if its juvenile. Hearing Lo Wang crack jokes during combat is a nice touch that keeps you coming back for more demon-slicing goodness.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of Serious Sam -or Painkiller-type games, as its the best in its genre by far.\n\nLastly, I`d like to add that Shadow Warrior`s opening "cinematic" might be the best to date, in any game ever!","January 1, 2014","true","16.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is awesome! Run around as um... a ninja named Lo-Wang (we would get into the Japanese vs Chinese argument, but that happened when the game first came out in 1997*). You're out for revenge (like all good ninjas), and you'll take it via lead and steel. The voice acting isn't the cartoony Chinese stereotype it was in the original, but the facepalmy oneliners still remain. The graphics are outstanding, with lighting effects, and spraying blood in every corner. The ragdoll physics are pretty good, and the coolest part of the gore-fest that is Shadow Warrior is that you can slice up foes Kill Bill style leaving a trail of gore and parts through out the numerous scenic temples and bamboo groves you traverse. A rough patch I'd say is the controls, which get a bit floaty with numerous enemies on screen, but they work. All in all, this isn't Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon or Ran, it is Rage of the Master or Hard Boiled and it does provide a thuroughly enjoyable bloody romp full of interesting enemies and scenic locations.\n\n*If you are basing your views on the thousands of years of diverse, rich cultures that encompass half of the world's population, on a (very tongue in cheek) game, then you are indeed a sad person and should probably log out, get out more.","June 23, 2014","true","2.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After playing the horrendously disappointing Duke Nukem Forever, I was fairly skeptical about this rebooted title.  At the very most, I was expecting a shallow FPS/FPK(First-Person Katana-ing) with decent action and an almost vacant story.  To be honest, I was surprised.  Shadow Warrior actually contains a story.  It's not particularly deep or engaging, but it is somewhat creative and the cutscenes were enjoyable.  The interaction between Lo Wang and the shadow realm demon Hoji ranged from annoying to hilarious, but I mostly enjoyed them poking fun at each other and taking cheap shots.  The action, however, was sublime - pure and simple.  Specifically, the katana was a pleasure to wield.  It sliced up demons and humans alike with noticable heft and precision.  The damage model for the enemies fit the game perfectly.  As the game progresses, new abilities for the katana and your "ki" powers are unlocked.  These range from a brutal thrusting strike from your katana to a shockwave-like burst of energy from your free hand.  During the game, you will wield a weapon in one hand and perform "ki" abilities with your other hand (think plasmids/vigors).  Unless you are dual-wielding akimbo style, this is the format for combat.  This opens up the possibility for numerous different attack combinations and variations.  In fact, the more varied and aggressive your combat style, the more karma points you are awarded after each encounter.  Karma is used to buy skill upgrades to further increase your skillset.\n\nWhile the katana is the staple of your arsenal, there are plenty of other weapons at your disposal, all of which feel solid and accurate.  Some are more effective than others, of course, but all have the ability to get the job done.  My only complaints about the weapons are that the fire-rate on some of them felt too slow and sometimes hitting the reload button prompted no response.  I would have to hit reload multiple times in order for the gun to actually reload.  The only reason that stands out so much is due to the rest of the controls being so responsive.  It wasn't a huge issue, but it was annoying at times.\n\nUltimately, this game was well worth a purchase, at least for me (sale for $11.99).  The in-house game engine produces some gorgeous visuals.  Texures look good, as do the lighting effects and the amount of color is refreshing.  No dull brown and greys here, well very little of that anyway.  That being said, I would have to recommend this title.  It's an action-packed romp that delivers on what it promises, unlike other certain titles (*cough* DNF *cough*).  I give Shadow Warrior 4 out of 5 bloody demon hearts.","June 23, 2014","true","52.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The enemies can get a little repetitive butthe storyline was very enjoyable.  Yes it still goes like many FPS's but still it keeps the game fresh and entertaining.  Besides chop the demon is a very fun game when you get farther in the game.  One final note, beware the bunnies.","July 12, 2014","true","17.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Happily, Polish developer Flying Wild Hog went back to the original and rather than slavishly remaking it, did a wonderful job in taking from it what worked and removing or radically re-imagining what didn't. The end result is a hectic, gorgeous-looking shooter in a classic style with just enough of a modern sensibility to make it feel fresh. The most crucial aspect of the game's success? It has what the classic '90s shooters had and what modern ones very rarely possess - personality.","December 10, 2013","true","22.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The carnage is fantastic, whether you're using the most basic sword slash, or the most explosive gun. It is rare that I find a game I have a genuinely hard time putting down, but Shadow Warrior is so damn fun that I just kept playing. Also, for a game that takes itself so unseriously, the story is surprisingly poignant. I really can't recommend this one enough.","December 12, 2013","true","14.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Very impressive 3D engine but be aware, it is very hard on the GPU. My 7970 frequently was 95% gpu usage.\n\nThe combat is really well balanced with the swordplay being a standout from the rest of the FPS crowd. Gameplay is mostly old school with tried and true tested method of hordes of enemies one after the other. The enviroments are filled with plenty of variety with things to shoot and explode with very impressive graphical effects. You are able to take down enemies limb by limb disabling them firstly before finishing them off.\n\nEven amongst the big budget titles of today it still looks visually impressive. Gun Mechanics are good as well with a good variety of weapons with multiple upgrades and modifications on offer.\n\nThere is also the odd easter eggs to find which reminds you of the old shadow warrior game from 1997. Seasoned gamers will be impressed by this. Unlike Duke Nukem forever, Shadow Warrior is a funny game with humour that actually works. You have a tag along demon character who is always giving his input on situations. At first i thought this was going to become a chore but further into the game i realised how well it was working and was keen to hear his next remark.\n\nHighly recommended and took me by surprise. Something different with that classic gameplay!","January 7, 2014","true","21.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you miss the old days of things like Serious Sam, you will like this game. No ADS and your sword is your best friend. The guns feel sorta weak, but headshots are deadly and it doesn't matter when your sword is so fun and deadly. The combos of powers you have are very awesome. My only complaint is that the flying enemies are super annoying. But every game has it's one annoying enemy so no worries. Also, figuring out where to go or what to do and navigation could be better for a game this linear. So if you like old-school shooters and don't mind having to figure your way around a bit, this game is well worth your time!","January 10, 2014","true","9.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Resource heavy, make sure you have the hardware to run it.\n\nGameplay: So far fun and evolving. Feels like the Classic Shadow Warrior with new machenics to explore. Three upgradable menus (Weapons, Skills, Powers) Tons of secrets with the classic shadow warrior humor. Definitely pleasantly surprised when something new happens, like you cut open a demon and a heart falls out, that you can actually use as a weapon. FUN.\n\nProblems: Not that serious but every time I launch the game my Sprint key is reset.\n\nShame this game is not more known. Definitely a hidden gem.
