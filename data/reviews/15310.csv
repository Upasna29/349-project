"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nicko541/recommended/15310/","nicko541","Kirbyfactor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nicko541/","135 products in account","Not a very populair game, the Settlers: Heritage of kings is a classis city building game, set in the old times.\nIn this review I'll talk about a few things:\n- The story\n- The gameplay\n- The graphics\n- Online play\n- Pros en Cons in general.\n\nThe story:\nThe story starts with out hero, Dario, chilling alone under a tree. His village gets attacked and mostly destroyed, the only thing that remains is the castle. After you fight off all the attackers, it's up to you to rebuild the village. Once you've succeeded, you're going to move on to a different place, this happens after every city. There are 15 main missions in total, which are all about building villages, making armies, and defeating other villages.\n\nThe gameplay:\nThe Settlers: Heritage of Kings is a strategy game. You start off each map with atleast four serfs, and with atleast one hero. A serf is a worker, they can build the buildings you need to evolve your village. New serfs can be bought in the castle, which is your main base of operations. The hero is a special kind of soldier, they have special abilities, there is a total of 6 heroes for you to play as.\nAs you start the map, your serf can only build a few buildings. Mines, houses, farms, and schools. In order to make more buildings, you will need a school to research, after that new buildings will be unlocked. To unlock more things to be researched, you will need higher leveld buildings, it's a various circle.\n\nThe graphics:\nThis game is from 2004, so the graphics aren't really the best. It's not minecraft level where it's all blocks, but it isn't far cry 3 either. You'll be able to tell which building is which and what it does, same goes with the heros, soldiers, and archers.\n\nOnline play:\nDespite the game being this old, there is a multiplayer option.\nThe only thing availible is LAN play, so if you and some friends are in the same house, you'll be able to play together. There's are a lot of maps to play together, which each player being a colour. Mulitplayer games do NOT have a hero.\n\nPro's:\n- Fun gameplay\n- Good music\n- Different types of missions.\n- Voice acting\n- Free play\n\nCon's:\n- Gets old after a while\n- Repetitive voice acting\n- You have to wait a long time for some resources.\n- Enemies have ridiculous large armies.\n\nOveral I'd give this game a 7/10, a good buy for 10 euro!","February 21, 2014","true","67.6"," 89 of 99 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","89","99","2","5"

When you buy this game play atleast 6 campains before you decide to stop since the first 3/4 campains have a lot of explanation about the game and it goes pretty slow without a lot of fighting against big armies.\n\nHeritage of Kings is a strategy game that plays in the middle ages.\n\nThe game tells you the story about the caracter called Dario, as he attempts to regain his land and regains his rightly trone. As a lost prince of the campain story he has to prove to the settlers that he is a good prince by defeating the evil forces. In addition to the spearman, archers, swordsman, calvery and cannoners he can recruit , he can also have company from certain heros later on in the game. Dario, Pilgrim, Salim, Erec, Ari, and Helias all have special ability's where they can fight with one can call bandits the other one can throw down bombs or even heal people etc.\n\nYou start up a campain with atleast 1 hero and 4 serfs. The serfs can build and repair buildings or can mine anc cut down threes you also have the option to give them weapons to defind your castle when you do not have enough troops.\nThere are 5 resources in the game wood,clay,stone,iron and sulfur there is also a currency.\nAside from wood to gain resourses you have to build mines on top of a deposit. Now you have new settlers working for you, you also have to build a place for them to eat and sleep else they will leave your village. You can also research in a college so you can upgrade your buildings and make new buildings where you for example create a army.\n\nPro's\n- Great graphics for an old game\n- Great storyline\n- Fun game\n- You can do whatever you want with a few guide lines\n\nCon's\n- No multiplayer besides Lan\n- repetitive voice acting\n- It's not a game that you play hunderds of hours\n- Sometimes you have to wait a long time for resourses","January 3","true","32.9"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","17","18","2","0"

I spent 20 minutes on the prologue/tutorial, 10 minutes on the campaign and then another 15 minutes loading all the different custom maps.\n\nThe tutorial teaches you 60% of what you need to know. From my time in tutorial I released the key points of the game. Its like your typical army building/population building game, areas to explore, enemies to destroy, people to protect and resources to gain. Also, everyone needs to eat and sleep too!\n\nI love the fact you can zoom right in to see buildings and people up close.\n\nAlso another thing i love is the options in recruitment. You can recruit a captain who automatically arrives with 4 troops of whatever solder type you trained him in (archery, spearmen, swords etc). The other option is to recruit soliders INDIVIDUALLY, i find this a great way to combine fast recruitment with the option to recruit singles to help the struggle with population caps.\n\nSomething Im not too keen on is the population cap, its like Battle for Middle Earth, so far ive only seen the cap at 75 max, everyone you control counts toward it.\nOn the lines of population, something im not too keen on is the auto training of certain civilians. If you build a college to research some upgrades, as soon as its built, 5 scholars arrive. All they do is research, eat sleep. Thing is they all still count to the population cap.\n\nI was worried about one major thing. I was assuming you can only do what the missions tell you. Wrong, that is only the case in the campaign and some custom maps. I did find 3+ custom maps that allow you full control with no set objectives.\n\n\nAll in all, I definatly reccomend it, and I super reccomend in while its on sale!\n","February 23, 2014","true","2.0"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","0"

It is altogether obvious in many situations that this is an English port, and a poor one at that.  Stilted language, missing narrations, bizarre unit acknowledgements (one unit actually speaks for a full 15 seconds when clicked on!), and other artifacts let this be known.   For instance, "quit game" quits the mission you are on; it doesn't actually exit your game.\n\n2.)  The game is excruciatingly slow paced:  building a decent economy takes well over 15 long minutes, and you'll need one before you can really do anything.  As such, every near mission requires long bouts of waiting just to start.  Once you've got it rolling, you're good, but it is still terribly slow.  Many missions take around 45 minutes to complete, the first 15 of which are waiting, and the other just cumbersome.\n\n3.)  The soundtrack during game only has one track that it plays over and over.\n\n4.)  Single-player campaign is insipid and dull.\n\n5.)  Clunky UI where it feels you can't zoom out enough.\n\nTHIS ISN'T A "BAD" GAME.  It is, though, slow and dull.  I got about 6 missions in before I just quit, not because of difficulty, but because the fun to work ratio was not high.  The game lacks polish, and the single-player campaign just feels like it is a collection of fetch quests.  I feel the Stronghold series did what this game was attempting to do better.","November 2, 2014","false","8.6"," 10 of 45 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","10","45","0","0"
