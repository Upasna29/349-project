Challenging 20 levels of platforming with wild west style. Like Megaman, if you're familiar with those.\n\nGunman Clive is a short but challenging platformer of minimalistic but nevertheless adequate graphics. There are three playable characters, one of which you have to unlock, each with their special skills. There are about 20 levels, every 5th of which is a boss battle. They take you through the wild west and the story hilariously hyperboles towards the end.\n\nLevels are sidescrolling action that last only a minute or so per stage. However, they're also quite challenging, requiring multiple tries to get through. Bosses have anywhere from 2 to 4 different attack types. Challenge rises from the low health of the player who can take only two hits before dying (on Hard difficulty) and also from death falls and insta-kill spikes of certain levels. Obviously, once you get familiar with the game it becomes a lot easier to avoid enemies and go through the previously difficult spots. Warning though if you're easily irritated, you might get momentarily frustrated with some spots.\n\nAfter a while the game begins to resemble very much the Megaman games of NES. While you have infinite ammo, your rate of fire is limited by your weapon. Many features of the levels from enemies to obstacles also resemble Megaman, from moving platforms to appearing and disappearing blocks to alternating gravity and wind machines. Admittedly, these features are part of virtually any decent platformer, which this one certainly is. There are also a couple of special levels with slightly different moving capabilities akin to Gradius (continuosly moving, sidescrolling shooter) and just about any sidescroller with rideable minecarts.\n\nI hope I'm not spoiling too much if I reveal that the third character is unlocked after finishing the game first and is a duck that can't attack, only fly short distances. This game mode is also a bit more difficult because of these limitations. Because of this there are also no bosses in this mode for obvious reasons and it is basically a different game altogether. This mode is very challenging to complete perfectly, adding several hours of play time to the game.\n\nFor such a small price this is a good platformer, maybe even too cheap for its content, for now it's like on a permanent discount. I hear it has been first released on 3DS, now rereleased on Steam with achievements. These are of the speed-run, no-damage run types with different characters. They can be quite difficult, though you can do the no-damage and speed-runs separately. The most difficult one is the one requiring completion of the game without dying. There are two versions of this achievement, one for the initial characters and another, probably more difficult one for the duck. I have yet to get all the achievements.\n\nSome people seem to have become upset because of some "misogynistic content". Myself, I found this concern hilarious. You can play either as the guy or the girl and save the other one. This is the incentive for the story. It isn't very original but the story isn't exactly the reason to play this game: it works splendidly for what it is.","January 3, 2014","true","5.5"," 175 of 201 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","175","201","0","3"

Gunman Clive was a nice short little platformer with (what I thought) were some pretty smooth/minimalistic visuals and a not-to-shabby soundtrack[arnehrberg.bandcamp.com] (I'll be honest, it wasn't really my taste - but that doesn't mean I didn't like it by any means). The gameplay itself was pretty fun - the game's comprised of a total of 20 levels (4 of which are boss levels), 3 unlockable characters followed by a moderately high replay value; the game itself is also slightly challenging if you're trying to go for speed-runs or higher difficulty settings. For a full price of $2, this game was a pretty fun time-filler (took me about 20-30 minutes to complete it the first time around, but I'm not stopping there). Methinks you'd like this game if you are at least somewhat a fan of platformers or if you ever liked the first Megaman games (as it shows many similarities between the 2).\n\nMy rating - 9.3/10. Definitely consider getting it. Heck, think about it even if you don't like platformers, especially since it's so fracking cheap.\n\nAlso, if you're on Windows you may want to try to get a free demo off of Desura.[www.desura.com] They also have a Mac-friendly version there as well.\nI've tried looking for demos compatible with both Mac and Linux, but I can't seem to find anything.... (I believe Linux is generally unsupported in in this case, but don't quote me on that.)\n\n[Edit]: It seems the review is getting some negative feedback for one reason or another...

Specifically, it plays like Megaman, with some enemies' functions and patterns lifted right out of it, despite the wild west setting. All you do is run, shoot sideways, jump, and climb ladders. Bosses are pretty strait forward with highlighted weak spots and life meters. 90% of the audio is the subtle soundtrack, while the effects are extremely soft.

It will remind you of a lot of old classic shooters such as Megaman as well as Contra. Think Megaman in western setting. The game itself is pretty short takes around one and a half hour to beat in normal mode. There's boss fights every 5 rounds and total of 4 bosses. 20 stages and they're not that long. Everytime you die you start at the beginning of the stage.\n\nGraphics - This sort of has a design which looks like hand drawn (not sure if it actually is). The game looks beautiful in my opinion and the art style suits it as well. The few number of colors used really make the artstye unique and looks very cool imo.\n\n\nMusic/Sound - This game has VERY nice music, when i say nice i mean i have literally taken the .ogg files from the games directory and put in on my phone to listen to. I was addicted to the soundtrack.\n\nGameplay - Fun gameplay which can be challenging. All you do is go through the stage and kill the cowboys, ducks(lol?), aliens with your handy pistol. There's some frustrating platforming as well. You can also get upgrades to your gun (think contra), there's a 3 way spread, a bigger buller which is slower but does more damage, there's even laser gun as well as a heat seeking gun. You have a life bar which lets you take around 4-5 hits before you die. Every 5 levels you get a boss fight which are pretty interesting and require you to learn their patterns to kill them.\n\nOverall i'd recomend this game, $2, seriously you can't even get soda for that now a days.","January 7","true","1.7"," 25 of 26 people (96%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","96","25","26","7","0"

There's a pretty good variety in terms of enemy designs, stage gimmicks and layouts, and boss enemies, and a decent selection of randomly dropped gun power-ups from enemies to mix things up here and there. Replay value lies solely in the Steam Achievements and personal satisfaction if that's your thing, and are aimed more toward hardcore goals such as finishing stages under par-times, without dying, and under certain circumstances which can only be unlocked by completing the game once.\n\nWhat Gunman Clive presents is utterly simple, but it's executed well enough to bet that you'll have a pretty good time with it if you're into older-school games like Contra and Mega Man.  You could really do a lot worse for the couple bucks this one's going for.","January 3, 2014","true","1.0"," 34 of 46 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","34","46","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tunaftw/recommended/262550/","tunaftw","Big Tuna","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tunaftw/","221 products in account","In the year 20XX, a former employee of Capcom shows his previous employers how to properly honor one of their own franchises as well as a truly great era of gaming, all while keeping the price tag under $2. Enter Gunman Clive.\n\nGameplay:\nAlright, well the game isn't ENTIRELY based around Mega Man style gameplay, more-so of its level design. The levels feel very reminiscent of Capcom's classic series, and were a joy to platform through; though there were a few levels that changed things up, such as a minecart level (Donkey Kong Country here) and a shooter level somewhat similar to that of Gradius. Otherwise, it sticks to the solid jumping and shooting formula of games past and executes it well. A couple mechanics here and there could have been explored further, such as the destructible bridges, which were only in one level.  Also, the controls were also pretty responsive and translated well onto the keyboard, they are also rebindable.\n\nWhere the differences from Mega Man really appear are the weapons. The weapons operate on a system more akin to the Contra series, where you can find upgrades for your basic gun that give it a new ability. Examples would be the classic spread shot, a slow explosive shot, to even a wall-piercing laser as well as a few others; like Contra, these are lost upon taking a hit. One change to these is that how you get them is a little randomized; some are static within a level, some you can get by chance from killing an enemy. The enemies also vary from generic bandits, to ducks and seagulls, to even some strange otherworldly enemies. The bosses are also a little more similar to something like Contra rather than Mega Man, as you don't end up absorbing their abilities or anything of the like, and also aren't all exactly memorable.\n\nUnlike Contra, however, you can take multiple hits without dying and have unlimited lives. The amount of hits you can take is dependent on the difficulty level selected. The hit detection in the game is pretty well done and I hardly ever felt I got any “cheap” deaths. There are also somewhat randomized cakes (similar to the random-ish weapons) that replenish your health. Speaking of health, one minor complaint is while the health UI is simple and non-intrusive, it only really gives you a general sense of how many hits you can take before death, rather than something more clear.\n\nAlso on the topic of UI, sadly, for you speedrunners and achievement hunters, there is no restart button on the pause menu; so if you know messed up on getting the "Star" time for that level or a "No Damage" run, you must either kill yourself (contributing to your death count) or exit the game and re-select that level. Another minor annoyance, but said speedrunning and achievements honestly kept my game time from being longer than about an hour.\n\nOne good thing for you guys is the helpful timer at the top of the screen for getting those pesky “Star” times. However, a nitpick as it may be, I wish there was an option to turn this off. This wish isn’t to benefit me or other achievement hunters, but to those who don’t care about those kinds of things and who just want to spend an hour to play through the game and not have to feel some sort of false pressure of a ticking clock. Otherwise it’s much more helpful than hurtful for replayability, it would just be nice to have the option to opt-out of it.\n\nSpeaking of replayability, there are two extra modes, one where you play as the damsel-in-distress herself, Ms. Johnson, with her ability to float (Super Mario Bros. 2 here); as well as a humorous Duck Mode in which you play a defenseless duck with the ability to fly upwards for a short bit. These feature a few more achievements on top of Clive's own No Death, Time-Trial, and No Damage ones. These alone probably increased my play time by four-fold and were pretty enjoyable.\n\nGraphics:\nTo quote the game's trailer, the game features "Weird Artsy-Looking 3D Graphics", which is more or less true. As you can see, it has an interesting sketch-book like aesthetic on top of the dominant western theme. Personally, the lack of color was not an issue for me, due to the game's length; and towards the later levels, while the continued use of brown could be seen as lazy, I felt it made the levels a little more surreal. In general, the model quality and animations were done pretty well too.\n\nAs an added bonus to being on PC, we also get 1080p 60fps gameplay as well as some super-sampling, making this the definitive version in regards to graphics (unless you want the 3D effect of the 3DS.)\n\nOne very small detail used in the game's graphics was how objects that did have color bled a little color through the outlines or weren’t completely filled in, especially when the screen was moving. This was a cool trick to make the game bare resemblance to a water-painting, again re-emphasizing the whole "Artsy-Looking" theme. There were probably some other tricks used that even I didn't pick up on.\n\nAnd an even smaller detail about the graphics (that may not even be on purpose), and I'm probably only one to make this comparison, but to me at least, sometimes when Clive dies or gets hit, the pose he makes bears some resemblance to the death screen of Zelda II. It could just be me, but as supportive evidence, you eventually fight what appears to be a "dark" version of Clive himself, much similar to the final boss of Zelda II. Ironically, he is very easy, unlike in the NES game.\n\nSound:\nThe music more or less fits the western style of the game, and gives it a bit more atmosphere. The tracks generally range from "okay" to "pretty good" to easily sum them up. Also, toward the end levels, the music begins to become a bit more chiptune-like, similar to that of the games inspired by it. The music is also composed by the creator’s brother, so this is not an entirely one-man effort.\n\nStory:\nClive himself is a man of few words, none at all actually. With a tagline like "In the year 18XX", you pretty much know what you're in for on a story level. Kill the bandits, shoot some ducks, save the girl, become a duck. It's simple and it works.\n\nThere is a possibility that there is a little more at play than what the story is on paper, such as how pretty much all of the stores are suspiciously owned by Mayor Johnson and named after him, but that could just be me trying to bring meaning to something meaningless.\n\nNow to the biggest overall complaint about the game: the length. I myself finished my first run through on Normal at around an hour. Then my first run without dying was about 16 minutes. The game is not heavy on content, more-so on replayability, but what is there is well-crafted and polished.\n\nAnd while its own trailer makes self-deprecating remarks such as "A Generic Old School Side-Scroller" with "Lots of Brown", this doesn't mean it is not well executed and that brown isn't put to damn good use.","July 17, 2015","true","7.9"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","11","11","0","2"

As the only hope left in the rampant west, you must don your sharpshooter and set out to take back the hostage (and maybe score a kiss in the process)!\n\nClearly I could be talking of no other game than Gunman Clive, a western side-scrolling shooter with a stylish look and a budget price tag, originally released on the 3DS and now making its way to PC.  It’s a simplistic game that could have easily felt at home on the NES, featuring many of the basic design philosophies common in that generation. You have a very limited range of moves, capable of jumping and shooting and little else, and are sent through short platforming levels with only spouts of variation therein, ending with a climactic boss fight that seems designed more to test who has the fastest trigger finger than anything else.\n\nThere are a few ways to look at a game of this nature. On one side, side-scrolling shooters have seen a great deal of innovation in recent years taking advantage of modern technologies to create games the likes of which could never have existed on the limited tech that started the genre, and making something like this seem a tad outdated in comparison.\n\nOn the other there’s absolutely nothing wrong with a simple, dare I say retro, simplicity which Gunman Clive so fully embraces. In some ways I enjoyed having such an uncluttered and uncomplicated direction that doesn’t require a great deal of thought to play, and is almost refreshing compared to more advanced titles of recent memory. All that said, what developer Bertil Horberg never managed or even attempted, was to outdo my expectations.\n\nEvery set piece, enemy encounter, and platform design felt like something I’d seen and played a hundred times over already, and eventually began to grate on me as scenes unfolded with so little originality. I can forgive a game to paying homage to others, but there’s something so...generic, about the way Gunman Clive plays, that I found it hard to be impressed after the initial awe of the fantastic visual style. The cheap deaths and lack of any checkpoints within levels also proved frustrating, for however short they may be.\n\nWere it to cost anymore I might have a hard time recommending Gunman Clive in any great respect, but for $2 it’s a perfectly solid (if often unremarkable) experience, that most should have no trouble finding an hour or two of enjoyment in. I would have liked for the developer to have spent more time designing and fine tuning the levels and controls, as most of the budget and focus seems to have been spent on the visuals (which while great, can’t make up for average to mediocre gameplay), but all the same there are far worse things to spend $2 and an hour of your time, provided you know what you're getting.","March 25, 2014","true","1.0"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drpixel/recommended/262550/","drpixel","DrPixel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drpixel/","3726 products in account","Gunman Clive is a western platformer, in the simplest sense. Its price of $2 is well-justified as it's short, sweet, and gives enough good times to outweigh the bad.\n\nOn the whole though, I was kind of bored with the whole game. Even with a length of approximately 30-45 minutes, this game that was originally on the 3DS and phone devices also isn't one I would normally even glance at. However, I enjoy platformers and thought the art style looked nice in videos so I decided to check it out. You play as Clive, or a female character who is the daughter of the mayor of some town (and whose name I forget). There's also a third playable character but I'll get to that in a bit. Clive controls similar to how MegaMan does in that series of games, minus the special moves, and the female lady (from now on I'm just going to call her "Umbrella) walks slowly but can float after jumping. For some reason I decided to play as Umbrella and she gave me some added challenge which was nice. I imagine playing as Clive would not be as fulfilling as her clunky slow speed made the game quite a bit more challenging.\n\nIn fact, I'm happy to note that this game does provide a decent challenge, even for experienced gamers. Enemies, which consists of bandits, wolves, and ducks oddly enough, move fairly fast and can appear at any time so you have to be on your toes. There are about 20 levels in the game, each of which are fast (about 60-90 seconds long each) and good for quick play sessions or a full playthrough in one run. In each level, your goal is merely to get to the end usually, unless it's a boss.\n\nNow, I'm really not a fan of the bosses in this game. They all feel the same because they mostly kind of are. Usually they just blast bullets at you and move around a bunch. They're bland a little boring sadly, but I guess for the price you can't expect much variety in the bosses. Maybe it was just a personal gripe but on these levels I usually blazed past them and didn't care for their designs or making a strategy at all. Blasting bullets right back at them usually worked every time for me.\n\nThe length may be an issue for some. Really that's what this game being a good buy or a bad buy for anyone comes down to. Now, I've heard some say this game can be beat in an hour, but I beat it in about 35 minutes without rushing at all so that seems a bit off to me. Considering this game is less than an hour long, I wouldn't say it's worth the $2 if you just run through it once. I like to play games for at least as long as I payed for, and if I payed $2 for it I'd like to get at least a 2-hour game back.\n\nNow, I'm not actually discrediting the game by saying I don't like its price as I do in this case. When you beat the game you unlock a third character, a duck. Yes, you get to play through the whole game again (minus the bosses) as a duck that can fly for brief periods of time and can't attack. It's pretty funny seeing a duck waddle past the enemies you had just beaten and it also provides a great extra layer of challenge that more games should try to do, even if it's as a joke. The duck mode is actually pretty tough and took me 30 minutes to get through about 1/4 of the game. There's also achievements for beating each mode with a gold star (for speed), not dying, and not getting damaged (which is crazy!). These can be pretty fun and hard to try and attempt, so in terms of replayability this game isn't too bad luckily. I've seen some people on the forums who have 5-10 hours and have all the achievements, so you can definitely get your money's worth if you don't mind trying some tough challenges.\n\nThe graphics are point that many love to mention when talking about this game. They're definitely very cool and "artsy" I suppose. It feels like you're playing something an artist doodled on a notebook, but brought to life. The dusty colors are nice to look at too. Overall, this game looks pretty good for what the developer had to work with, and it's probably one of the shining points of this game. The sound is sadly not quite as good, with basic sound effects and just "okay" music. Nothing was really memorable, but I enjoyed the main menu theme and a few songs slightly.\n\nIf you're looking for a multi-hour long game, this isn't it. In fact, it isn't even an hour long unless you're very slow and die quite a bit. However, the potential replayability with the fun (and hard!) duck mode and the pleasant art style may suck you in. It's worth a shot, if you pardon the pun. ;)","January 25, 2014","true","0.8"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/trapfly/recommended/262550/","trapfly","Trapfly","http://steamcommunity.com/id/trapfly/","85 products in account","Your enjoyment of this game heavily depends on whether you liked NES platforming games, since Gunman Clive is highly reminiscent of those, albeit with better graphical assets among other things.\n\nPeople usually compare this game to Mega Man, but it's really more similar to Ghosts and Goblins.\n\nThe setting is obviously that of the Wild West, and you're entasked with saving some lady, or something... The story is definitely minimal, so if you're expecting a narrative about life as a cowboy, you might be disappointed.\n\nAll the sounds and audio fit well in the game, although they aren't extremely impressive. One of my main complaints on this topic are that some of the music tracks are quieter than others. Ironically, the boss theme is the most silent of the bunch, which doesn't do the game any good.\n\nPersonally, I'm glad the graphics aren't 8-bit, since we already have enough of those types of retro platformers. This game has a rather pleasing art style, even though it is a bit simplistic, and the color palette consists of mainly brown (with the exception of enemies).\n\nWhen playing the game, I found it to be difficult, but not agonizingly frustrating when playing on the highest difficulty. There are three difficulty settings, which only affect how much health you have. If you die, you'll be forced to restart the enitre level. Forutnately, each stage is only around a minute long, but that doesn't stop them from being challenging.\n\nYou won't be forced to restart the entire game when you run out of lives though, because this game doesn't abide by that common and annoying feature. You're able to select any level you've unlocked once you've beaten them.\nFor its price, Gunman Clive offers a decent amount of stages: 16 standard levels and 4 boss fight stages.\nWhile the game doesn't introduce any unique gimmicks I haven't seen in a platformer before, it's a polished game and certainly fun to play.\n\nThere are power ups too, which you can find from killing the many enemies you'll encounter, or just stumbling upon them on the ground. These are just different types of guns, and the occasional healing item.\n\nOne thing I highly appreciate about this game is that it retains the quirkiness of old video games. You'll have to fight pelicans, eat cake to restore your health and even travel to the moon near the end of the game.\n\nIt also carries a great amount of replayability. You can earn achievements for completing all of the levels quickly, or without suffering from any injuries. There are also two characters you can choose from: Clive, and the... one lady... (who plays much differently).\n\nMost importantly, once you complete the game for the first time, you unlock duck mode. While being a duck, you can't attack, but get a jump boost to compensate. Boss levels don't appear here since ducks are extremely useless in combat situations. By the way, this is much more challenging than playing as anyone else, although it's not entirely apparent in the beginning areas.\n\nIt's basically a pacifist run of the game, except you can't change your mind half way through because you get annoyed at dying a lot.\n\nPros:\nIt's a retro platformer, but not a poorly made one. The graphics are also of a unique style.\nIt made me hate pelicans and ducks, but taught me that large beaks are a great place to store explosives.\nThere's a lot of replayability.\nThe level design is well thought out.\nDUCK MODE\nCons:\nThe music tracks don't have a consistent volume.\nThe second boss (the train), makes all the other bosses in the game look stupid in comparison.\nNothing extremely unique is included here, with one exception.\nNo controller support.\n7.5 / 10","April 6, 2015","true","3.9"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

I liked platformers ever since I was kid. But I barely remember how hard some of them are and could take up to a week to master because there were not saves in most of them. But back onto Gunman Clive. I was collecting tons of platformers in my wishlist just in time for another Steam sale. So when I rushed to buy it but didn't have a change to played until now. After a long coding session I decided that it was time for some relaxing platforming.\n\nI fired up the game and was enjoying the art style and music and that simplicity of the game. All seem perfectly set up for a nice gaming evening. But... You know that kind of games that you liked when you watched the trailer but hate after playing for 5 minutes. At this point you probably think that it was exactly the kind of game. And you are right. Controls seemed sluggish, game unreasonably hard even on easy and I started thinking about requesting a refund. When I was ready to quit it something stayed my hand. I asked myself what kind of gamer am I to quit the game without giving it a proper try. So I went back to main menu, selected my save on normal and began my path to liking this game.\n\nThat path wasn't easy at all especially considering that I didn’t play games let alone platformers for 2 years. So I started mastering the controls first which looked like a task close to impossible at first actually turned out a lot easier after having some practice. With that out of the way I started training to shoot properly. After that it was time for jumping and shooting at the same time. And that aspect of game mechanics was crucial for having fun in this game. Once I became good at it the game became much more likable but didn't become relaxing. And you know what it probably won't anytime soon if at all. Another awesome mechanics that made the game fun was moving while shooting in opposite direction. And it becomes more and more important once you get into a boss fight. Even though I thought I was pretty good at playing this game when I met the first boss it almost made me hate the game again. But as it's said "Don't hate the game, hate the player" I couldn't be more true with this one. I did however feel that boss was to powerful for the first encounter and he had one trick up his sleeve that I couldn't overcome. After some additional training and to be honest, luck I was done with him.\nAfter the fight I felt like a changed man. Levels felt more and more adequate and game in general became more likeable. Levels felt enjoyable and almost relaxing but I knew that I will relax when I complete the game.\n\nThen I met the second boss. And it was one hell of a fight. I stood my ground, fought like a man, fought intelligently. Instead of trying to do as much damage as fast as possible I was tried to live longer and do consistent damage. And this time I rarely suffered from rage-inducing deaths and I felt like I was failing rather than the boss being overpowered. Afterwards I was greeted with some platforming challenger more than with enemies. But then I realized that it was very late and decided that it was enough for the day.\n\nWhile I was slowly walking towards the computer to turn it off I felt satisfied, I knew there are more challenges ahead and I liked the game. I was rather hard to get to that point but I made it but it was totally worth it. So would I recommend it? Yes, I would but with few key points in mind. First and foremost you need a controller. I didn't try it with keyboard but when I tried other platformers it was terrible. And the question what kind of gamer are you? if you're more casual then it would probably leave you hating it for being too hard and not fun. But if you're more hardcore than casual and can endure that kind of challenge then go and grab it.\n\nMore reviews from Gameaways Curator","January 12","true","3.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Originally published on the Nintendo 3DS, this title got a solid PC port, including full controller support and HD resolutions. At the stupidly low price of 1.99 this is a no brainer for fans of classic platforming. Clive has to navigate a series of jumps and enemies, including rabbits and ducks for some reason, and along the way you can get gun power ups, like this three way spread or these homing bullets. You can also fight bosses, but they tend to be bullet sponges with repeating patterns that can be a bit frustrating. It’s cute, it’s fun and it’s another well done 3DS to PC port that’s priced to go.\n\nFull Video Review https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yjn2FO4wdyI","January 21, 2014","true","0.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

The controls are tight and feel precise, when matched with the fair platforming, creates a enjoyable experience. New elements are introduced every level, however many are gimmicks which only appear in their respective levels, due to this it should also be noted whilst playing the duck some of these gimmicks feel like a hinderance to play. Gunman Clive is very reminisant of Megaman and Donkey Kong Country as many of the levels feel similar to those I have played in the aforementioned games which I enjoyed. However whilst the game is great in all there are some issues; Difficulty only changes how much health/hits you can take whereas I feel the game would benefit more if it changes the levels or enemies. Whilst the game is indeed short, say 2hrs for your first run of every character combined, I wouldn't say it was repetative, each character handled slightly difficulty, where Clive was the standard character who was the all-round character, Ms. Johnston played a lot like Peach, where her jump has a extended reach thanks to the small float she recieves each jump. The duck was by far the most enjoyable to play as for me, it was more challenging due to the fact you had to avoid enemies rather than confront them. I would definitely recommend this to casual players and platform fanatics alike.","December 2, 2014","true","4.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

People will put up with a stiff or janky game for all sorts of reasons, but you generally don't have to coax them into sticking with a game that simply feels right. Gunman Clive is just such a game, one that is familiar and welcoming from the moment you start it, so much so that you won't mind when it's all over so soon.\n\nYou play as the aforementioned Gunman Clive in a platforming quest to save his sweetheart... or vice-versa, if you're feeling particularly progressive. Clive can take a few more hits but Ms. Johnson can float SMB2-princess-style, which is always a pleasure in a platformer. No matter the gender you'll be armed with a trusty pistol that can lay down three shots on the screen at a time. Most enemies can be dispatched with one or two shots, and sometimes drop additional weapons like spread shots, explosive bullets, and piercing beams.\n\nThere are sixteen levels spread across four areas, with each level serving as a one- to two-minute scene. Some will take you some practice, especially once they start adding gimmicks like moving platforms, vanishing platforms, fans, zappers, and more. The further in you get, the more the levels will remind you of classic Mega Man gauntlets, which seem to be the chief inspiration for the game. The music follows suit, a collection of gentle, twangy riffs on 8-bit-era tracks. The graphics are even more beautiful in motion, animated with a simple, sketchy flair more distinct than most platformers manage.\n\nGunman Clive won't last you too long on a single playthrough, but there's a hilarious third character and a hard mode that lives up to its name to tackle once you beat it. Considering how charming, challenging, and just plain fun it is, you really can't pass this one up. It's Mega Man platforming with Contra weapons that looks great, sounds great, and controls like a dream. What's not to love?","February 22","true","1.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

There's some shooting involved but mostly it's just running and jumping through short levels (about 1-2 minutes long if you do it perfectly) with a boss battle after about 5 levels or so. I think that there are about 20 levels (about 1 hour of playtime), but my memory is so terrible I can't even remember.\n\nI love the art style, it's nothing short of amazing, if only a little colorless.\n\nIn all honesty, I was hoping for game like the brilliant Sunset Riders (look it up !), but this will do nicely I guess. But if you want a true wild west shooter stick with the superb Call Of Juarez Gunslinger.\nSince it's only a few bucks you can't really go wrong with this game.

A solid little game which can beaten in around an hour.  Levels are short but have no checkpoints so dying restarts the level.  Not too much of a problem except for a couple of levels that accounted for over half of my deaths.  Some of the level design is of the "you need to die once to know what to avoid next time" variety.  There's also the feeling that the devs went down a platformer checklist when creating level features but some of the stuff they did is pretty cool.\n\nBosses are pretty standard, not great, not bad.  Enemies drop gun power-ups and they're mostly in the Contra style.  There's no up/down/diagonally shooting, though you can shot while crouched and jumping and this stops feeling restrictive with a couple of minutes of playing. Your health bar doesn't do a particularly good job of conveying how many hits you have until death, as you'll get killed at times with what looks like to be a decent chunk left.  Game would've been better off just having some type of numeric representation of health, those this isn't too big of a deal.  There are no game overs, you have infinite attempts at levels.\n\nThere are three playable characters, Clive, Ms. Johnson, and the duck.  Ms. Johnson is clearly inspired by Peach from Mario 2 in how she controls, with the big difference between her and Clive is that she can float for a bit on her jumps.  The duck cannot hurt enemies but can jump/fly and is more of a challenge run character.\n\nAll said, a decent little game with some replayability, though a bit on the boring/bland side at times but hey, it's 2 buck at full price.

It's a well made game which takes a lot of ideas from megaman but also has many own. It can get frustrating at points and make you wish it had checkpoints, because you start over at the beginning of the level every time you die. But the levels are short and bosses are on their separate levels so it's not too big of a deal. There's a lot of variety in enemies and gameplay and it introduces new guns to you now and then.\n\nIt's a very pretty game but can get a bit irritating on the eyes after a while because of the limited color scheme. Make sure you don't sit too close to the screen while playing and take a few breaks if needed. It's challenging and at times tricky game but not impossible. The story is basically nonexistant other than your old boring damsel in distress. The game is short but feels very solid, so it's basically a steal at this price.

I haven't played platformers much since about 1991, when the platformers of the time, with their extreme precision jumps and shots, never varying even an iota, created a feeling of a Holy Grail Quest that lasted long into the night. Now the term "platformer" is VERY different, with things like FPS platformers. Say WHAT!?\n\nGunman Clive. First off, I paid 99 CENTS for it, mainly because of the art. That and the incongruous images on the Store Page. Cowboys and space flight?! Sure, why not when the possibilities of that concept are nearly endless. The idea of cowboys firing ray guns from hover platforms is hard to turn one's back on, especially with such AMAZING, yet simple, art. And then one starts to play....\n\nThe right hand moves, the left jumps and shoots (so far, at least on a keyboard.) That's all you need to know. Part of the reason I now avoid platformers is some physical issues. This is not a "jumping" game. THANK YOU! Yes, you jump, and some are quite precise, but not while shooting, and flipping. while cooking an omlet and reading Moby ♥♥♥♥. But that's not what this game's really about. The jumps are generally harder to MISS than to achieve. A player starts by searching for a kidnapped farmer's daughter, or some such, as either a cowboy named Gunman Clive. (Why not the more aliterative "Cowboy Clive" is a mystery) or a "Ms. Johnson", presumably the victim's mother. (VERY nice touch. I rather more enjoy the female character, with her dress-induced mincing steps, and her frequent floating to the ground, as result of said dress inflating.) A player has a choice of 3 skill levels. I haven't tried the hardest, but it seems as though the difference in the first two is mostly the amount of life one has. It's just you and you trusty 1,000 shooter. (Or some such.) You're attacked by cowboys, wolves, bunnies, ducks... Yes, ducks, too low to the ground to shoot. Usually. Sometimes shooting something results in "birthday cake" health, which shrinks in size and finally vanishes if you don't reach it in time. Or (naturally!) one of a selection of ray guns. Unfortunately, the ray gun is as hard to hold onto as it is (usually) valuable in battle.\n\nIt's true (at least for me) that some sections between save points must be played dozens of times. While this might be a dealbreaker in some games, not with Clive. Things change. A cowboy with a gun before now throws dynamites(sic), and he's GOOD! But maybe shooting him will produce a piece of cake or a ray gun. Nothing is ever exactly the same, but similar enough to encourage progress with most attemps. The differences are certainly enough to keep the game from getting boring, or excessively frustrating. The good news about achievements: GC has them. The bad news: you aren't likely to see any of them.\n\nHopefully this review will grow with time. I've not gotten far yet, primarily on middle skill level. If you'll excuse me, I really MUST get back to the game....","May 2, 2015","true","0.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

First off, the $2 price tag is a really low price for this game. The only real problem I had with it were the controls, which I expiremented with and made less akward. Not to say the controls are terrible, in fact, many people will have no problem with it, as they feel arcadeish. I am just used to standard fps controls. Overall the game is nice. It has a very nice graphics style, as you can see from the trailers. One more problem I had with it, which is no big deal since it really doesn't affect gameplay much, is the enemies. Some of them shoot randomly at nothing, duck behind cover for a few seconds, and pop back up to do it again and again. But that's just nit-picking.

The game follows Clive and his journey to rescue Mayor Johnson’s daughter, who was kidnapped by a group of bandits. Although that may be extremely generic, this game was built for its gameplay, not its story.\n\nThe game packs sixteen levels and a few boss fights as well. Each level takes about one minute of your time, although this is not including the various times that Clive dies, of which, there will be several occasions. A few of the levels took me a very long time to complete, mostly due to a few challenging mechanics that were only present in said levels (rolling rocks and mushroom jump-pads). There was a level that featured mushrooms as “jump-pads” which I had a difficult time with, as in, it took me quite some time to master how to actually use the mushrooms to boost myself up to where I needed to be.\n\nThe graphics are definitely one of the game’s strong points. The game features a unique, minimal artstyle. It looked like everything was done with crayons or colored pencils of mostly yellow/brown shades. It fit the game well, surprisingly, and I really enjoyed this style. The music was not too spectacular, but wasn't that bad.\n\nGunman Clive is an excellent platformer-shooter overall. Like I said, it’s essentially MegaMan, but western, which is an excellent combo. And with a $2 price tag (on Steam), it’s a steal.","January 6, 2014","true","1.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Despite its looks, every gameplay element present is lifted directly from oldschool platformers, and anyone who's ever held a game controller ought to know exactly where those disappearing blocks, one-hit-kill spikes, and inexplicably missing sections of mine cart track came from. Among them all, Mega Man 5 seems to have been borrowed from most liberally, with shoutouts to Charge Man, Star Man, and Gravity Man's famous levels, nevermind the fact that Clive himself handles exactly like the original Blue Bomber himself (with his pre-90's control scheme, specifically).\n\nLike similar indie title Bleed, Gunman Clive is a love letter to these games of yore, and to its credit, it executes the mechanics pretty perfectly, remixing incredibly familiar elements in comparatively new and challenging arrangements. Furthermore, the skin stretched over these old cogs is a surprisingly pleasant one. While embracing minimalism is hardly a new trend for these retro-style indie games, Gunman Clive actually does it gracefully, foregoing rehashed 8-bit-style graphics for something more contemporary- specifically, a combination of 3D models and artful shading for a simplistic, sepia-toned storybook visuals. The similarly minimalist story of silent-protagonist-saves-the-girl is at best unintrustive, yet still manages to be charming, if only for the sheer ridiculousness it quickly devolves into. Adding further charm is the story's feminist-friendly inversion, where Clive himself plays the hapless damsel while the armed and ever-capable Ms. Johnson takes it to the bad guys with her own victorian style.\n\nDisappointingly, despite drawing most of its appeal from his ability to emulate classic platforming adventures, Gunman Clive doesn't necessarily attempt to surpass them. While the Mega Man series famously featured selectable levels and a generous handful of bosses, Gunman Clive is content to remain linear and dishes out only a precious few boss encounters, not a one of whom will be bestowing their signature weapon upon defeat. There's a justification for this lack of ambition, however, and the proof is in the price tag. The asking price for Gunman Clive is two dollars, which might be less than you've ever paid for a video game that wasn't 90% in a Steam Sale.\n\nFor its asking price, you'd be doing yourself a favor to give Clive a fair shot, especially if you've got any love for oldschool video games. It's all too short, but every bit as sweet.\n\nPlus, ducks.","January 17, 2014","true","2.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It really gave me a Mega Man vibe with how some of the stags were set up along with it's soundtrack. This game isn't exactly going to win any awards for revolutionizing the genre, but for the price, it was really worth it for me. If you go into this game like you spend $15 or $20 on it you're probably going to be disappointed.\n\nThere are around 5 different weapon power-ups to use throughout the game, though you lose the upgrade the moment you take damage. All the stages take around 45 - 90 seconds to beat without dying with boss fights taking place after  4 stages I believe. Dying on a stage takes you all the way back to the beginning. It's really not as frustrating as people make it out to be. Like I said before, the stages take no time to be. The game allows you to play as three different characters and after beating the games the achievements will keep you going for a few hours more if you're really into the game.\n\nIf you're looking for a quick nostalgia fix then this game might be right up your ally. Definitely pick it up on discount or in a bundle if you think it's too much now.","January 5, 2014","true","1.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

The game has a nice aesthetic to its visuals but the actual gameplay is very weak, with uninteresting levels and enemies making it all feel very trite. There is very little to the game, and the best thing about it is how quickly it can be completed.\n\nStory\n\nYour boyfriend/girlfriend is kidnapped and you must rescue them. It is an excuse plot with no bearing on the game.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe gameplay is very simple and also very poor; there is nothing wrong with the particulars of the controls, though they are sharply limited, but the actual level designs aren’t very interesting and the enemies are all very samey. You run, you shoot, and you jump on platforms, but none of the levels really do anything with it. The shooting powerups are okay, but nothing special – spread shot, a super powerful shot, a penetrating shot, and a tracking shot, none of which are especially exciting.\nThere are a few different types of enemies, but in the end there is very little to the game itself and the level designs don’t really have anything going for them. The game is very bland and no-frills, and each level takes about a minute to complete – two minutes in the longer levels. As there are only about 16 levels in all, the game is pretty short.\nThe only real highlight of the game are the four bosses, but even they aren’t very interesting – they are somewhat interesting visually, but gameplay-wise they are the same old attack pattern bosses we all know and love from the games of old, with nothing really to recommend them or make them especially memorable examples of the sort.\n\nGraphics\n\nThe game has a nice aesthetic to it, and is pleasing to the eye with its sketchy style.\n\nFinal Summary\n\nGunman Clive is a very cheap game, but the reality is that it still isn’t worthwhile; indeed, it isn’t worth playing for free, because it simply isn’t worth your time. The folks who praised this game gave it very undue praise – they compared it to Megaman, but they left out the fact that he plays like Megaman 1, with far less interesting level design, and far less interesting weapons.","January 7, 2015","false","2.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

There are variations of powerup guns you can pick up, but you lose them as soon as you get hit once.  It looks deceivingly easy if you watch the videos, but don't let the simplicity fool you.  There are various types of levels to mix up the gameplay a bit.  The game also rewards players for not receiving any damage, or making a speed run, which should appeal to the real hardcore crowd.

You name it, it's probably here somewhere.\n\nThe level design is where everything falls apart. There is a theme of not being able to tell that an enemy is right in front of you until you scroll it on the screen. You have to replay stages at least 3 times to just get through it. Oh, and of course THERE ARE NO CHECKPOINTS. None. Zero. You die right at the end, it's right back to the start.

Very similar to Mega Man. However, the level design and gameplay elements are uninspired and cliche, and the soundtrack is limited, misfitting, and grows obnoxious about 10 minutes in. The choice in protagonist is nice (you can choose from 3 different characters) and as you play through the first or second time, you may be reminded of Super Mario Bros. 2 due to the fact that the characters each function in their own ways (the girl floats similar to Princess Peach in the aformentioned game). This does add some variety to this otherwise uninspiring adventure. I may also warn you: this is not for people who get frustrated easily. Classic gamers are more likely to enjoy it. Is it worth the $2? Depends on what you're expecting in this experience. It's a short little adventure, taking only about 40 minutes to beat, but it's packed with potential replayability. However, if you're not interested in replaying the game for fast times, no damage/deaths, etc., then it probably isn't worth it.","January 5, 2014","false","0.6"," 6 of 23 people (26%) found this review helpful","26","6","23","0","0"

Not that this review should push the length limit, but I'd like to stay consistent.\n\nGameplay: It's hard not to look at this game and think, "Oh hey, a Megaman-esque game." You really wouldn't be wrong thinking that, either. It's also got a little bit of Contra/Probotector in it, with weapons that you can pick up throughout the levels and lose once you get hit. As far as the levels go, they've got a pretty Megaman-ish feel to them, although the game sometimes hops onto the Donkey Kong Country train. When it does, it's not exactly subtle about it, either. There's a minecart stage and there's the ladder-enemy-avoidance-thing from Vulture Culture. It's not bad, but it does feel pretty uninspired whenever these sections roll up.\n\nIn fact, the most original feeling levels are the ones at the very beginning. Now, even some of the less inspired levels do make good use of the design mechanics... sometimes. For example, there's a really neat jump you've gotta do in the Gravity Man stage that makes clever use of momentum. Even though they may not always be the most inspired, the levels are still pretty fun to play. As for the enemies and bosses, there's a pretty good variety of enemies, if once again some of them are blatant ripoffs of Megaman enemies (the five-way turrets, for example). The bosses - of which there are four - are all pretty fun to fight.\n\nYou can play as three different characters: Clive, the man protagonist; Ms. Johnson, the not-man protagonist, and a duck, the not-hu-man protagonist. Clive and Ms. Johnson play pretty similarly, with Clive being the hardier of the two while Ms. Johnson has a better jump as well as having a hover. The duck, oddly enough, was the most fun to play as. Since you are a duck, you can't fire a gun. As such, the game becomes about avoiding enemies. This does force you to look at the stages in a different manner, allowing for some pretty neat twists on level design. Of course, since you are a duck and cannot fight things, bosses have been removed.\n\nOverall, I had a pretty good time with this game. My current playtime of 1.8 hours reflects my playthrough of the game as the three individual characters. I normally consider a $1/Hour of Gameplay to be an ideal value for a game, and this game certainly delivered that. It may not always have the most original level design, but it's still pretty fun nonetheless. 7/10.\n\nStory: Sometimes you are a man rescuing a lady. Sometimes you are a lady rescuing a man. Sometimes you are a duck rescuing... I dunno. Anyways, the story ain't the focus of the game, or even a major element, so I'm leaving it out of the scoring.\n\nGraphics: The main draw of this game, almost certainly. I'm sure I don't really need to tell you that this game looks utterly fantastic, so I won't even bother. You've got eyes. The game does have a bit of an issue with alt-tabbing when in fullscreen (throwing an error along the lines of "A Shader has failed to compile"). The one time I alt-tabbed out of fullscreen I didn't bother to check whether the game still worked or not. Anyways, this isn't too big of a detriment. You can choose your resolution, and the game otherwise worked perfectly fine for me. 5/5.\n\nSound: The music sure is good in this game. You can get the OST by doing a little directory digging in the files of the game (/SteamApps/common/GunmanClive/data/sound, and the music will be the .oggs). As far as the sound design, I found it a bit lacking. Hitting enemies just doesn't have the punchiness I would've liked. It just makes things feel a little flat. Apart from that, there really isn't much else to talk about. The music is great, but the sound direction could've had a little bit more. 4/5.\n\nOverall scores are: 7/0/5/4; cumulative score of 8.0/10. I'd say it's worth the $2, definitely. If it's ever on sale for any reason, it's definitely a steal.","July 21, 2014","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It costs less than a delicious, but ephemeral, giant chewy candy bar.  It costs less *guilt-inducing frown* than a cup of coffee. Just buy it.\n\nThe distinct visual style is charming. It looks gimmicky in screenshots, but when you get the game loaded and see the fluid, scratchy style you'll immediately appreciate it more. It works, the art is tightly-controlled, and you immerse in the game rather than being distracted by the stylistic effect.\n\nIt's definitely short and sweet, but this is a simple, simple game that doesn't try to do anything except provide you the ability to: Run to the right, jump, climb ladders, ride mysteriously-levitating platforms, and shoot cowboys, ducks, jackrabbits, pelicans, wolves, and more cowboys.\n\nI don't agree it's quite like classic Mega Man. You have special jumps (the girl can fluff her skirt to fall slower, for example), you can duck, and you don't collect new abilities from enemies — gun powerups just drop randomly that change how your bullets fire (heatseeking, shotgun spread, etc). You can only have one special shot at a time (new ones replace it).\n\nIt is like Mega Man in other ways: you can't aim (you just fire whichever way you're pointing), and the enemies have simple patterns you quickly learn.\n\nFor $2 this is a few solid hours of amusement, and then a pleasant diversion you can pick up again and again for 10 minutes any time you feel like having some very simple run, jump, shoot side-scrolling.\n","January 17, 2014","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This was a real standout game on the nintendo store and it still holds up on the PC. First of all I'm very surprised by how good this game looks on a monitor with the art style looking just as good as ever. It looks as though it has been sketched out with constant movement even in motionless objects somewhat similar to the A-ha Take On Me video. What you really want to know however is if this game is any good or not.\n\nIt plays almost identically to early Megaman games. You jump, sometimes you shoot, pretty self explanatory but the main thing jump and shoot games need to have is very tight controls and this delivers. You never really feel like a death is cheap as damage is always avoidable with quick reactions. The game itself can be quite challenging at times but this is a good thing. After a death you get straight back into the action starting at the beginning of the level almost immediately making you want to keep going to complete that final level.\n\nSo for the game length my first play through on the 3DS took me just under 2hours or so but I can see this being much shorter if you're not terrible like me. So for the replayability there are 2 additional characters along with Clive himself. Ms. Johnson has a slightly different mechanic in that she can float in her jumps allowing you to do some little extra tricks but mostly the same kind of gameplay. However the third character is the Duck which is hilarious to play as and surprisingly saftisfying as you have no attack and must avoid all enemy contact (which means a few of the levels are skipped as they would be impossible to do). Along with the additional characters there are also awards for taking no damage in a level and also for speedrunning it which are for nothing more than bragging rights and steam achievements but give you something else to aim for.\n\nAll in all the amount of content in this game and how good it feels is more than enough to warrant the small price tag. I'm just glad I got to support this developer twice with my purchase as there is so much potential. So if you're a fan of the Megaman series (specifically 2) or you just want a classic feeling jump and shoot game I cannot recommend this to you enough. There is so much character to this game you'd be doing yourself a disservice by not playing it!","January 16, 2014","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It costs less than a delicious, but ephemeral, giant chewy candy bar.  It costs less *guilt-inducing frown* than a cup of coffee. Just buy it.\n\nThe distinct visual style is charming. It looks gimmicky in screenshots, but when you get the game loaded and see the fluid, scratchy style you'll immediately appreciate it more. It works, the art is tightly-controlled, and you immerse in the game rather than being distracted by the stylistic effect.\n\nIt's definitely short and sweet, but this is a simple, simple game that doesn't try to do anything except provide you the ability to: Run to the right, jump, climb ladders, ride mysteriously-levitating platforms, and shoot cowboys, ducks, jackrabbits, pelicans, wolves, and more cowboys.\n\nI don't agree it's quite like classic Mega Man. You have special jumps (the girl can fluff her skirt to fall slower, for example), you can duck, and you don't collect new abilities from enemies — gun powerups just drop randomly that change how your bullets fire (heatseeking, shotgun spread, etc). You can only have one special shot at a time (new ones replace it).\n\nIt is like Mega Man in other ways: you can't aim (you just fire whichever way you're pointing), and the enemies have simple patterns you quickly learn.\n\nFor $2 this is a few solid hours of amusement, and then a pleasant diversion you can pick up again and again for 10 minutes any time you feel like having some very simple run, jump, shoot side-scrolling.\n","January 17, 2014","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not that this review should push the length limit, but I'd like to stay consistent.\n\nGameplay: It's hard not to look at this game and think, "Oh hey, a Megaman-esque game." You really wouldn't be wrong thinking that, either. It's also got a little bit of Contra/Probotector in it, with weapons that you can pick up throughout the levels and lose once you get hit. As far as the levels go, they've got a pretty Megaman-ish feel to them, although the game sometimes hops onto the Donkey Kong Country train. When it does, it's not exactly subtle about it, either. There's a minecart stage and there's the ladder-enemy-avoidance-thing from Vulture Culture. It's not bad, but it does feel pretty uninspired whenever these sections roll up.\n\nIn fact, the most original feeling levels are the ones at the very beginning. Now, even some of the less inspired levels do make good use of the design mechanics... sometimes. For example, there's a really neat jump you've gotta do in the Gravity Man stage that makes clever use of momentum. Even though they may not always be the most inspired, the levels are still pretty fun to play. As for the enemies and bosses, there's a pretty good variety of enemies, if once again some of them are blatant ripoffs of Megaman enemies (the five-way turrets, for example). The bosses - of which there are four - are all pretty fun to fight.\n\nYou can play as three different characters: Clive, the man protagonist; Ms. Johnson, the not-man protagonist, and a duck, the not-hu-man protagonist. Clive and Ms. Johnson play pretty similarly, with Clive being the hardier of the two while Ms. Johnson has a better jump as well as having a hover. The duck, oddly enough, was the most fun to play as. Since you are a duck, you can't fire a gun. As such, the game becomes about avoiding enemies. This does force you to look at the stages in a different manner, allowing for some pretty neat twists on level design. Of course, since you are a duck and cannot fight things, bosses have been removed.\n\nOverall, I had a pretty good time with this game. My current playtime of 1.8 hours reflects my playthrough of the game as the three individual characters. I normally consider a $1/Hour of Gameplay to be an ideal value for a game, and this game certainly delivered that. It may not always have the most original level design, but it's still pretty fun nonetheless. 7/10.\n\nStory: Sometimes you are a man rescuing a lady. Sometimes you are a lady rescuing a man. Sometimes you are a duck rescuing... I dunno. Anyways, the story ain't the focus of the game, or even a major element, so I'm leaving it out of the scoring.\n\nGraphics: The main draw of this game, almost certainly. I'm sure I don't really need to tell you that this game looks utterly fantastic, so I won't even bother. You've got eyes. The game does have a bit of an issue with alt-tabbing when in fullscreen (throwing an error along the lines of "A Shader has failed to compile"). The one time I alt-tabbed out of fullscreen I didn't bother to check whether the game still worked or not. Anyways, this isn't too big of a detriment. You can choose your resolution, and the game otherwise worked perfectly fine for me. 5/5.\n\nSound: The music sure is good in this game. You can get the OST by doing a little directory digging in the files of the game (/SteamApps/common/GunmanClive/data/sound, and the music will be the .oggs). As far as the sound design, I found it a bit lacking. Hitting enemies just doesn't have the punchiness I would've liked. It just makes things feel a little flat. Apart from that, there really isn't much else to talk about. The music is great, but the sound direction could've had a little bit more. 4/5.\n\nOverall scores are: 7/0/5/4; cumulative score of 8.0/10. I'd say it's worth the $2, definitely. If it's ever on sale for any reason, it's definitely a steal.","July 21, 2014","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Kind of like Mega Man if Mega Man forsook all his trademark abilities for Contra-esque weapon pickups such as spread guns and bouncing bullets. The game definitely lifts some elements from other old-school games as well such as disappearing blocks and Mario firebars. The game is 20 levels long, but the levels are very short and are mostly more like checkpoints then actual thematically-divided levels.\n\nGraphics: The game is 3D with simple models, but also some kind of hand-drawn filter over everything that makes it look very visually appealing, if a little monochrome.\n\nSound: Easily the weakest part of the game. There's only a handful of music tracks, and they're all pretty forgettable. The sound, meanwhile, is all just a handful of bleeps and bloops, but the worst offense in this department is when things happen that should be accompanied by sound but aren't. Boss entrances are the most affected by this. It's really jarring seeing a steam train transform into a giant robot and do so COMPLETELY SILENTLY.\n\nStory: About as much as your average NES platformer. A short intro sequence. A short ending sequence. Maybe a short scene somewhere in the middle. A generic "save the princess" plot (or Ms. Johnson in this case.)

However, GC (Gunman Clive) adds a Western/Steam Punk twist to the beloved genre.\n\nPlot Summary:\n- It is 18XX, you are a gunman named Clive (hence the title) and are tasked to rescue the Mayor's daughter/your love interes, Ms. Johnson, from bandits that have kidnapped her; however, there is an other wordly influence to this crime. You must jump and shoot your way throug platforms, enemies and bosses with your cowboy, gunslinger abilities!\n\nPresentation:\n- The first thing to catch your eye in GC is its unique art style. It is stylized in a sketch artstyle; this somehow enhances the spaghetti western feel due to it making it seem more vintage and stylized. The use of differents shades of brown screams the west. Secondly, the music is what you would expect in a western. The music fits the mood perfectly; at times, it is very reminiscent to some of Mega Man's soundtrack, giving it a high octane feel. Genre and setting truly mesh well together; being a cowboy and all it just makes sense.\n\nGameplay & Mechanics:\n- GC offers some variety to its gameplay. From the beginning, as it is custom gaming etiquette, you are allowed to choose your difficulty; however, you can choose to play as Clive or Ms. Johnson (more options unlocked upon finishing the game). They differ from gameplay. Clive is faster and can run and gun; whereas, Ms. Johnson cannot but can float decend slowly; very much like Peach's float ability from Super Mario Bros. 2 (USA). The layout of the levels feel like a mixture of Mega Man and Metal Slug level design (so I can make a point of reference). There are enemies in cover and you can take cover as well. You must do platforming challenges; the infamous knockback deaths are present in this action platformer; however, it is not as intrusive as in other Nintendo classics. Unlike the Blue Bomber (Mega Man), you acquire power ups via random drops and they are only temporary. The game itself is fairly challenging but nothing too difficult. Unfortunately, its on the short side, paying homage to other classic games.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n- As I look over my experience of this game, it was rather enjoyable. Eventhough, its rather short (I was able to beat the game for my first time under a hour), I picked it up again literally after I have just finished it to rank the levels and try out the other characters. If you asked me if it has replayability, its a definite yes from me. If the length concerns you, the low price is more than justifiable (especially because I bought it on sale when the game is already so low priced). Gunman Clive is the perfect homage to NES Megaman games and classic games in general. Had lots of fun; I'm sure you will too.\n\nPS:\n- If you'd enjoyed this game like I did, I would have you know that there is a recent sequel on 3DS. Hopefully, it will get ported to PC like this one","May 3, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The level design is very good and the game is fun and addictive. When you die, there is no game over screen, your are just sent back to the beginning of the level immediatley (like Super Meat Boy), so your won't get frustrated. Another significant thing is the artstyle. It looks very nice and looks hand painted. But since it is only $2.00, it is pretty short. I was able to beat in in almost 2 hours. That was the only bad part. if there were more levels to expand on all the features, that would have been awesome.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bumblebug/recommended/262550/","bumblebug","Bumblebugbee3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bumblebug/","250 products in account","Gunman Clive is a very unique, super polished, platformer.  Taking place in the old west, you embark on a rescue mission.  There isn't much of a story but that doesn't matter.  This highly-stylized adventure is not only beautiful but a blast to play.  It may take a lot of inspiration from classic platformers but the game is a whole new twist on the genre that is definitely worth checking out.\n\nAt its core, the gameplay is quite simple.  Dodge enemy bullets, return fire, and navigate the various obstacles in your way.  Your reflexes will be tested as the action is fast.  This helps simulate the feeling of being stuck in the middle of the shoot-outs you see in a classic western.  When you're not exchanging fire there a plenty of platforming segments as you jump around various moving objects.  The tight controls leave no need for guess work.  You'll feel great with the mobility of your character feeling very fluid and natural.\n\nYou can choose to play as Clive or Ms.Johnson, the other of which will be kidnapped.  There isn't too much of a difference between the two, Clive can move a little faster and Ms.Johnson can float for a bit.  After beating the game a third character is unlocked that plays dramatically different.  As you proceed on this rescue mission you pass through several different environments.  These include the desert, the woods, a cave, and beyond.  Each area provides new, varied, obstacles and enemies that will try to slow you down.\n\nOne of the neatest parts of this experience is the artwork.  The backgrounds and characters look like they popped right out of a stretch book.  As the lines shift and dance on screen it really feels like a drawing has come to life.  The arrangement of the soundtrack is also superb.  Clearly who ever composed the music for this game knew exactly how to set up a wonderful atmosphere.  As you play through the levels, even if you die, the music keeps playing.  This really helps keep you in the game and ready to face the challenges set before you.\n\nI absolutely adore this game.  From the beautiful artwork, to the smooth platforming, everything about this game fits perfectly.  If you're a fan of old-school platformers you need to play Gunman Clive.  Even those who don't play this genre as much can enjoy this game for its atmosphere.  I'm still having fun in my second play-through and I'm really looking forward to playing the sequel.  So put on your cowboy hat and charge in guns blazing.","April 10","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
