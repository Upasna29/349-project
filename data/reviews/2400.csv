Instead of having to uncover a killer, The Ship makes you the killer. To be more specific and familiar to the gaming audience, The Ship is a very polished and creative take on the Assassin's Creed Multiplayer experience (but also keep in mind that this game came before the Assassin's Creed Multiplayer genre was released)....where the main gameplay mechanic revolves around finding your target, called your quarry, and breaking their face as stealthily as possible. To do so, there are plenty of lethal weapons and objects to wield, and even some environmental traps that you will find yourself potentially avoiding. To add flavor, everyone else on each map has a quarry as well. While pursuing your own target, you'll need to stay alert and attempt to spot the passenger readying a knife for your back. The Sims element of the game, quells upon your daily needs to survive (food, drinks, toilet, sleep, etc). The 'character's needs' element makes for a deeper gameplay experience, as your character is vulnerable to attack while you're downing a bag of chips or snoring on a bed. And it is surely funny when your friend murders you on the toilet. The Ship is one of very few games that brings a large amount of enjoyment to my friends and I. Built on Valve's Souce engine, a majority of gamers can experience a $20 title with basically 4 copies to gift away. A little too much? Ask four of your friends for $4 each, and your all set! Overall, The Ship is a very innovative, satisfying and humorous experience that a bunch of 5 friends can't pass up. "Let us set sail!."","October 15, 2013","true","14.3"," 409 of 432 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","409","432","0","3"

I said I didn't like the singleplayer, but the multiplayer is a totally different story.\n\nAlso another little note, at time of writing, the in-game server browser is broken. You can find games through Steam (Steam Window: View > Servers > Change Filters > set game to The Ship).\n\nThe Ship seems to be a lesser known, yet highly underrated game about murdering other people without being spotted. It's a true blue stealth game in that you actually have to kill your quarry without being seen by anyone. If you pull out a weapon in front of a guard, security camera, or are seen holding one for too long by other players, you get arrested and penalized. The game also punishes random deathmatching, so players have less incentive to grief. The game is really tense because everyone is a target. while you're hunting your target, someone else is hunting you, and you have no idea who it is until they start looking shifty, make a move on you, or kill you.\n\nIt also combines a little bit of The Sims in that you have to manage your needs: hunger, thirst, toilet, cleanliness, boredom, fatigue, socialization... All the while trying to hunt down your quarry. The game also encourages mixing up your murder weapons by increasing the money you get for a kill with a given weapon the longer it goes without being used. Once a weapon is used, it drops to the bottom of the list and only gives you the minimum payout.\n\nThe game is a buttload of fun and deserves more love and attention. This game also comes with a bunch of copies that you can give to friends. I highly recommend it, especially if you can pick it up during a sale.","December 4, 2013","true","13.3"," 195 of 204 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","195","204","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/2400/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","The Ship is an amalgam. It combines gameplay genres in satisfying and entertaining ways. Whereas many games that incorporate multiple genres end up as generic experiments gone wrong, The Ship not only manages to keep from sinking, but sets sails for the high seas of adventure. This is one seriously imaginative game. While certain elements may remind you of other popular games, The Ship manages to combine these elements to create a unique concept in gaming. Essentially a murder mystery, The Ship combines elements of the whodunnit classic board game Clue with shooter elements, in addition to some personal management features not unlike The Sims. There's lots of action, tasks, strategy, and laughs to be had. You can play with others online or offline with bots. Each mode has its own good and bad points, but the good points outweigh bad.The unique part is that this means that you yourself are someone's target, and must avoid being killed by your secret stalker while you're looking for your own target.The basic idea behind The Ship is that you play out a murder mystery on a luxury liner that's decked out in the art-deco style of the 1920s. But this isn't an adventure game, despite the Agatha Christie premise. A first-person perspective and maps loaded with narrow corridors and small rooms make the game feel like a shooter, although instead of blasting everyone in sight, you're assigned to kill a specific victim on the sly for cash, and his or her current location is updated at the bottom right of the screen every 30 seconds. Instead of blasting away with shotguns and BFGs, you mainly do your dirty deeds with improvised weapons such as golf clubs, letter openers, barbecue tongs, and croquet mallets. The Ship brings a hilarious, fun, yet totally odd style to the first person shooter community.  When most players are playing along, this game is a blast and there are some really great moments to be seen here.  The single player mode leaves a bit to be desired, as it mostly just acts as practice for online play, but it's still actually pretty usable and fun.  For its budget price, it won't work if you're looking for great graphics or a lot of all-out action, but once you get into the game's wacky style of play I think you'll find it's wonderful and very satisfying.\n","October 27, 2014","true","7.1"," 223 of 248 people (90%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","90","223","248","19","6"

I sure do, because at the time, all I thought was that they were ripping off the ship.\n\nI was wrong. AC multi is a lot worse.\n\nThe Ship is one of the best multiplayer experiences on the internet. It's a combination Assassin's Creed, The Sims, and a little Madworld mixed in.\n\nPlayers are stranded together inside one of several large cruise ships as a random skin, populated with a large host of NPCs as well. Each player has a target, who they recieve a face for and nothing else. Their job is to find that player on the ship and kill them. The trick is that you lose points if you kill anyone you're not hunting or being hunted by, including said npcs. There are cameras at various locations around the ship, which will cause you to get arrested and timed out if caught brandishing weapons openly. However, you have a set of needs such as hunger, thirst, hygeine, bladder and sleep, similar to The Sims, which force you to keep moving to meet them, usually away from the cameras. Your goal is to act as much like the unassuming NPCs as possible, both to avoid detection from those hunting you and to disguise yourself from the prey you're tailing, all while managing your meters and picking up the weapons you'll need to secure the kill.\n\nThere's a huge host of weapons and environmental hazards with which to do so, and point values for each vary wildly over time. This forces players who want to stay on top to constantly be changing their tactics and style. Certain weapons can only be found in specific locations on each ship, so highly desired gear can become choke points which force players to meet similar to Q3A duels.\n\nThe ship is full of more than weapons, though. In addition to portable food items which can restore health or your need meters in a pinch, most guests board with more than the clothes on their backs. By raiding their rooms for garments, you can swap out your clothing if you think you're being followed or after each kill to disguise yourself and throw the other players off your scent. You can't change your face, but someone following to the side or behind may think you're an NPC and move on.\n\nThe result of all this craziness is a really clever form of deathmatch that uses true stealth and deception, because you're trying to trick other players instead of AI. Stalking prey feels really rewarding and so does tricking your attacker into revealing themselves under a camera or turning a corner and unexpectedly fighting back. The ticking time from your meters at the bottom, the rapidly changing point structure and high ranking players attracting more hunters make the pressure always on and puts players on their toes.\n\nIf all this seems right up your alley, wait unless you're super eager and have nothing better to do. The Ship is getting an HD version in early 2016, though as far as anyone can tell right now, it will be multiplayer only. The Ship also has a singleplayer campaign, though it's not nearly as fun imho. The unique aspect of Ship combat is pvp stealth and sneaking up on Sims in their sleep feels more like a clunky, uglier Hitman Absolution.","June 17, 2015","true","7.0"," 164 of 181 people (91%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","91","164","181","16","0"

Each game round, you have to kill on specific person onboard one of several ocean liners - the titular Ships - and at the same time, someone is hunting you. Both you and your target - or 'quarry' - can take cover under the watchful eye of a Security Guard or Camera, but your hunter will likely be quite happy to bribe the Security to ignore their crimes while they bring that big ol' bat of theirs and beat your ♥♥♥ to death with it.\nEach other player you meet is a potential threat, and whether they come right at you wielding axe or gun, or sneak around and try to whack you from behind or lure you into a trap is up to them.\nBut, again, it's not just that simple - the winner of the match is decided by who has earned the most money for their kills at the end, and each weapon has a randomized and steadily increasing price for its use, be it Frying Pan, Revolver, Flare Gun, Umbrella or Wallet Bomb. Once the weapon is used, its price drops down to a measely $100. Thankfully, you have access to a list that shows which weapons are paying out the highest. It's up to you to find them, mind.\nWhile all of this is going on, your character has needs of their own - hunger, exhaustion, hygiene and growing loneliness all play a factor, and the longer you're alive, the harder it becomes to stay that way.\n\nThe environments are beautifully stylized. Each map has a different theme while sticking to a creepy, paranoia-fuelling atmosphere. The larger ships are a little dark and foreboding, while the smaller ones are much more colorful and fun. As the amount of people out for your blood increases, the atmosphere and your sanity darkens.\nEvery ship is laid out completely differently, from the very simple to the aggressively complex. Learning the maps and where to find hiding spots and secrets is the key to success.\nThe character design is quite cartoony, something between TF2 and TellTale characters. It fits the tone very well, being neither silly nor realistic.\nThe sound design is just marvellous. Every weapon impact on your quarry is satisfying, my personal favorite being the 'THWANG' of the Frying Pan or Cooking Pot. Old timey music plays through every radio and in every bar and restaurant, footsteps getting louder behind you make your heart jump, the wind, splashing water and airhorn blasts outside make you chill, and... well, let's say your character's visit to the bathroom is... descriptive.\n\nIf I have to criticize it, I will say the AI bots are very thick, more concerned with wandering about like cattle, more grazing, sleeping and pooping than hunting, only engaging in combat when they happen upon their quarry by chance.\n\nAll in all, I love this game. An exciting, fast-paced murdery romp on the high seas, combining regular first-person combat skills with strategy, planning and lunatic paranoia. There is a bit of a learning curve, but once you get the hang of it, you'll be totally enthralled.","August 18, 2015","true","34.0"," 57 of 61 people (93%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","93","57","61","10","1"

You forget that it is 10 years old when you are playing; this is mainly due to the fact that it is a concept that is currently unrivalled when compared to games of today.\n\nAdmittedly, it takes a fair amount of effort to create a multiplayer game; the server has to be hosted by a member of your party as there are no public servers available (This requires forwarding of port 27105). Other than that, it's an easy game to get into.\n\nThe basic premise of the game is that you have to hunt for your quarry, while being hunted. You get a list of the best priced weapons when pressing M, if you find these and kill your quarry without being detected and therefore detained, you will get a higher amount of money.\n\nThere are various maps, all of which are fairly good, these can be selected with console commands. The spare slots in the server are populated with a fairly good AI.\n\nIf I can offer one piece of advice, it's keep an eye on the people around you, and watch that eye.\n\nMy only complaint is that this game is so old, if it was revamped and brought into today's standards; I could imagine an even greater game would be born.","October 31, 2014","true","6.4"," 60 of 70 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","60","70","0","0"

If I had to describe it I would say it's like the Sims and the Assassin's creed multiplayer combined, all along with a rather interesting art style. It is like the Sims in that your character has persistent needs throughout the game that you must deal with, and along with the hunt and hunted type pvp you'll be doing means you have to balance killing your target, hiding from the person hunting you, and making sure your hygene, hunger, tiredness and other statuses are fullfilled. The game also features an ecconomy where you get money for kills and this can be spent on items or supplies to refill hunger or thrist.\n\nOverall the game is a boat load of fun and it gets even better with friends, if you and some friends can buy this together it should keep you entertained for a while.

Well, it fails to sell itself at all really. Gifted to me by a friend, who was equally unsure of the game, I thought I would give it a try. What an excellent addition to my 2013 collection The Ship turned out to be. Just in the nick of time as well!\n\nTo put it simply, you're a predetermined character on a ship and are given a mark. Similarly, another character has been given you as their mark, so you can't just run round willy-nilly. If you ever watched Ace Ventura as a child then you'll catch the game's drift fairly quickly. You're on a hunt - for humans.\n\nVaried weapon choice provides replayability and good humour. There are plenty of bizarre and wonderful weapon to find and take out your mark with, each with a reward. Bat someone with an umbrella in a public place and you'll be well remunerated. Similarly, tipping hats to Cluedo and whacking someone with a candlestick will also get you big bucks.\n\nConsidering that the sole goal of the game is to commit murder, The Ship is surprisingly light-hearted and amusing. It's one of those games you can dip in and out of without getting hooked, but get quick jollies from. I've thoroughly enjoyed this somewhat hidden gem and would recommend it highly.\n\n","December 31, 2013","true","10.0"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

The game modes consist of Hunt(You have a name of another player/CPU and you must find him/her and kill them without getting arrested or killed yourself), Team Elimination(Simple; Two teams find and kill each member of the opposing team), Death-match(Kill everyone), Duel(One-on-one battle), and Team VIP(Kill the enemies teams, VIP whilst keeping yours safe). I gotta' admit it, It's a very fun multi-player game. I especially like the realism aspects such as, Thirst, blatter, colon, hunger, sleep, entertainment, loneliness, and some more(If I remember correctly). If you fail to attend to those needs, Your player will die in a unique way according to which thing you forgot to attend to. Anyway, In conclusion; The Ship is an awesome multi-player game and I for sure, suggest that you guys should try it out.\n\nRatings\nCategoryRatingGame-play8/10Realism9/10Popularity in players3/10Weaponry variety10/10All-round Enjoyment9/10","February 21, 2015","true","25.4"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","15","21","0","1"

It requires you to be a lot more strategic compared to other games in the FPS genre. Every round, you are given a random person (called a Quarry in the game) that you have to try to hunt down and eliminate without being caught by security guards, security cameras, or witnesses. If you get caught, then you go to jail for a bit. But at the same time, you have someone that is also trying to hunt you down and eliminate you in a stealthy manner as well. Every so often, you are notified of the location where your Quarry is/was. But your Hunter is also notified of the location where you are/were every so often as well. So it's a constant feeling of uneasiness because you can't really trust anybody as you're moving around the ship. And you're trying to eliminate your Quarry while also trying to not get eliminated by your Hunter (and you don't know who your Hunter is). If you eliminate an innocent (someone that is not your Quarry or your Hunter), your character loses money. And if you eliminate too many innocents and put your character in a lot of debt, you automatically get kicked and temporarily suspended from the server for 1 hour. Another good thing about this game is that all of the characters have real human needs that need to be attended to every so often. These needs include eating, having a drink, going to the washroom, showering/bathing, sleeping, socializing, reading something, etc. Having to attend to these needs prevents players from just camping the whole time. If a character's needs are ignored, then there are consequences such as the character naturally dying. Or falling on the floor and going to sleep for a bit which makes you completely defenseless against your Hunter if they find you. So the requirement of having to attend to real human needs every so often is one of the things that makes this game so unique and different from the rest of the FPS genre. The game also requires you to use different weapons/methods towards eliminating your Quarry each round. Eliminating your Quarry with the same weapon repeatedly every round results in very little award money for you. Each round, the weapons get a different award money amount based on which weapons have been used the most so far in the match. The weapons and items that you will find as you search around are randomized. The Ship also has a pretty decent single player campaign/story. And it also has a tutorial for new players to teach them the basics of playing the game. The game can be played by yourself offline with bots or online with other people (and bots if wanted). You can host your own server by yourself (playing with bots at first) that other people can join (players that join replace the bots). The game also has different gamemodes and maps as well. This game is very deserving of a lot more online players than it currently has. So I definitely recommend The Ship for people that are looking for a multiplayer game that's very unique, creative, and different!","August 31, 2015","true","18.4"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","1"

It has potential to be somehting GREAT. When you buy this game, you will find three new games in your library (The Ship, The Ship Single Player, The Ship Tutorial) - I will go over each one.\n\nThe Ship is the heart and soul of the game, and is what could be amazing about it. Basically, all the players have a "mark" on one of the other players, but nobody knows who you're hunting which can provide interesting scenarios. To spice things up, you cannot kill or even bear a weapon while being watched by civilians, guards or cameras. This means, you could lure a potential hunter into a trap! This sense of an almost "stalemate" makes things very interesting and with enough dedicated players could make this one of the most interesting and enjoyable games here. The problem is, the servers are down so you have to manually join servers - not too big a hassle, but it is definitely inconvenient, especially when trying to play with friends. Also, from what I've seen, not too many active player hosted servers.\n\nI expected the Ship Single player to be the same as online except with bots - essentially be a "training area" for noobies. It is instead, a very short campaign with no options to play "multiplayer except with bots" unfortnately. Like I said, the campaign is very short, it is unrewarding, has annoying voice acting and is terribly unrewarding. The "levels" if you want to call them that can be too easy or ridiculously unfair out of nowehere. The most annoying part is one slip up (even if just caught with a weapon) all the progress yo made in that level is restarted, which means more walking across the ship to talk to the annoying sounding characters. Campaign can be beaten in about 1 to 2 hours depending on how fast you are at it, and if you want to "role play" or not. The game also has really annoying mechanics. You have various needs sor tof like a sim game, which would be fine, if they didn't randomly have to be upkept every two seconds. The most annoying is the "sprinting" in this game, which is the alternative to walking very slowly. The so called "sprinting" is tremendously slow and runs out of energy almost immediately. You get about 2 seconds max at sprinting to then have to wait for about 10+ seconds before you can do it again. The killing animations are hilarious, so killing other players is the highlight of the game, to be honest, which seems to be lacking in variety in the campaign - hence why the multiplayer could be so good!\n\nThe tutorial is short lasting, covers all the mechanics of the game and is pretty important to "play" just to make sure you know what you're doing. Why the three games weren't integrated as one, I'll never know. The tutorial speaker, however, talks incredibly slow and waits long amounts of time before going on to the next thing she needs to say - this gets annoying very fast.\n\nI know it sounds like I am just complaining about the game - which hoenstly my review is mostly that. With that said it is not a terrible game and when on sale for 5$ I think this is one everyone should pick up. BUT PLEASE PUT THE SERVERS BACK UP DEVS. This game has gret potential and I know it can be enjoyable despite the annoyances. At its current state, however, I cannot recommend it.\n\n+GREAT potential in multiplayer\n+Funny killing animations\n-Outdated graphics\n-Annoying mechanics (read review)\n-Servers not up in-game","February 2, 2015","false","2.2"," 36 of 63 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","36","63","0","4"

Graphics not very good anymore. Annoying music keeps looping in levels. Built-in server browser is not working so you need to manually add servers for multiplayers.\n\nAnd then the good.... Well good sides goes something like this: I lurk around the ship corridors nervously looking for my target while avoiding exposing my back to others too much. One can never know when YOUR killer strikes. We all hunt each other - problem is you can never know who it is until the weapons are brandished. Assuming you see them do it.\n\nBam! i found my pray and in a busy intersection i find a quiet little spot where nobody is looking. I whip out the ice pick and stab the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to death from behind. Yes! price money is mine.\n\nLater i get hungry so i head for the bank automat and pick up some cash. Life is good. i head for the nearby snack machine. There is a bit of a crowd here so surely nobody would try anything?\n\nLike a poker player i place my back against the corner and take some potato chips to sate that hunger. As i take my first bite the man standing next to me in the crowd puts away the book he was reading and whips out a shank and stabs me in the ♥♥♥♥ing face while i am enjoying my potato chips. It just happened to be so that i placed myself into a defilade and the crowd was not looking at me at the right moment.\n\nI fall down into a pool of blood and my killer scurries behind the corner and starts to walk casually away. I can almost hear him whistle as he does his casual trot on the corridor. A crowd gathers. 'Oh, yet another one bites the dust'. and then they carry on with their own game of cat and mouse. Many more will die tonight.\n\nThis dear reader is what 10/10 moments are in a game that is revolutionary in idea but unfortunately very much ignored when it was released and thus it is almost abandoned except for the player base.\n\nDid i mention even newbies can be good at this game? Practice a bit with bots and then hit for the MP servers.","January 7, 2015","true","4.3"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","9","12","3","0"

Knowing that one of your friends might be the one who is assigned to kill you  (or maybe you're the one who's quarry is your friend) makes the whole thing funny while you are Skyping or smtn.\n\nSingleplayer:\nIt's quite short and the story is pretty much meh. All you gotta to do, are some tasks given by the Bellboy. Those aren't the "Kill that guy"  objectives only. Hard difficulty makes your butt clench very hard, especially while fighting with the melee weapons.\n\nOverall:\nMostly it's a multiplayer fun - lots of maps, weapons, interactions... Interactions kinda reminded me of The Sims. Even the animations and characters looked like from The Sims. Ships are confusing at first and walking around non-stop might affect your patience, because sprinting drains fast and restores slowly. Also, your character needs drain annoyingly fast.\n\n\nNo achievements, SP is short, MP is fun while playing it with friends only, in my opinion.\nWait for the sale, it's not worth 10 euros.\n\n6/10\n\n\nBtw, why the ♥♥♥♥ there are 3 different downloads for this game - MP, SP and even the Tutorial needs to be downloaded???","April 6","true","8.3"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","0"

It has some of the most hilarious ways how to kill a fellow passanger, like closing them into a freezer or throwing an umbrella at them. It's a better hunting simulator than other actual hunting simulators out there :D. In the beginning of the round, you get a name of your quarry and your future murdurer gets your name. It's only up to you to escape and still kill your victim. All that while managing your human needs. The insecurity and distrust is incredible, if you use teamspeak during the game and it reaches the fun level of Trouble in Terrorist town mod. The ship is great fun but doesn't offer much replayability, only if you really fancy it I guess or have 20 friends who do, because the servers are sadly very empty these days, playing with the AI is decent though 8/10","January 17, 2015","true","13.0"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","67","10","15","5","0"

Your goal is simple: Kill a target passenger while YOU are ALSO somebody's target. If you successfully manage to kill your quarry, the weapon you used will determine what score you should be granted for that kill. Your hunter will still be looking for you however, and you should do whatever it takes to survive safely.\n\nYou have 2 options upon joining a match; become a Passenger (a passive Ship passenger) or a Hunter.\n\nHunters have a target passenger they need to kill out of the view of guards, witnesses, and cameras.\nPassengers serve the same purpose, except they do not have a target to kill. Passengers only need to remain safe for the round.\n\nThere is also a needs system like The Sims (Eating, going to the toilet, sleeping, boredom)\nand this prevents players from camping in the safety of rooms with guards, cameras, or staying near witnesses. Witnesses also have a timer in which they can only be a technical witness of a crime for a short time, and will walk by you, traversing the rest of The Ship. Witnesses are also AI controlled, and the other AI in the multiplayer seems to be pretty smart/sneaky sometimes.\n\nOn top of that, there are certain "sweet spots" players that have guns might still be able to use to pick off their prey from a safe distance.\n\nTONS of different weapons and some wacky weapons that each grant different money rewards, and money is your score in multiplayer.\n\nLOTS OF GAME MODES OTHER THAN THE CLASSIC 'HUNT'. TEST THEM OUT AND HAVE FUN!

The severs don't appear on the list without going through the Steam server list, and setting up a server is difficult, it's best to play it over LAN with friends.\nWould I still recomend it?

(You have to look up a Server IP on your browser, though that's not very difficult.)\nOverall? I give this game a 8/10, it's a good game to play despite all the cons.\nThis game gets the Melon seal of approval.","December 8, 2015","true","10.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","0"

This game is rlly a lot of fun and even though i ignored it a bit due to the server not showing issue i have been playing this quite frequently again. Basically you´re given a target wich u need to hunt down while killing it with an object ranging ffrom an umbrella to a machinegun. The idea is to not get caught by the camera's or guards doing it else u will get arrested [wich u can get killed in there as well if ur unlucky] prety simple right? Wrong not only is there a time limit to it but the object u kill the target with based on the object kill list [highest ranked object gives most cash] matters and u have to deal with hunger, thirst, sleep, hygiene and the occasional toilet visits as well to keep ur character from dying. And the biggest treath is that you are beign HUNTED as well :O. So kill ur target and escape from ur killer till timer runs out and gratz u won the first time now try to get on top of the list till u win the whole round]\n\nI highly recommend playing the tutorial first as it rlly gives u a idea on how everything works[takes like 10mins max] .

Sure, the servers are lacking players but I find it more suspenseful when there are fewer players fighting on a massive ship. Basically, this game is like the sims (In that you need to keep your character sociable, well fed & hygienic) mixed with the ability to beat the hell out of other people with canes, umbrellas etc. The ability to throw a weapon is also such a laugh, you can run away from your pursuer sure, but more often than not that just means that they're going to throw a fire axe straight into the back of your head.\n\nThe good:\n- Can wear kilts\n- Can find tommy guns in bedroom drawers (Easy there Michael Corleone)\n- Can get brutally murdered in the shower/ in your sleep/ while urinating!\n- There are many different ship maps to play on. (Each map is quite unique)\n- Range of weapons ranging from a simple umbrella to a winchester rifle :O\n- The element of suspense (Sure, it's a cartoony game, but when people are chasing you, oh god...)\n- Requires some form of strategy - The need to find your target & then take them out without any witnesses.\n- There is a lot of interaction within the game (As stated before, it is like the sims in some ways)\n- Range of game modes - Elimination, Deathmatch (Just a few examples) & the team varieties.\n- Well worth the money (Just a decent pick up and play game for the casual gamer)\n\nThe bad:\n- Sometimes when the game indicates that there are no nearby witnesses, you get arrested out of the blue.\n- Going to prison within the game can be a traumatic experience (Don't drop the soap!)\n- Doesn't seem to be a mode in which you can just kill everyone freely at your leisure (Not good for those who are insane and itching to commit mass murder)\n\nThe ugly:\n- The graphics (Don't worry, they don't ruin the fun or the tension of the game)\n\nSo as you can tell, the game is pretty good. Sure, it isn't amazing, but it isn't to be expected from such a low budget game. However, there can be a lot of funny moments within the game when playing with friends especially. For example, a friend of mine was like 'You come in this room and i'll kill you' to which I merely shot him through the window with my tommy gun. Like I actually needed to go into the room... ;) If you're looking for a game to pick up and play whenever you feel like chasing people with an axe like a rapid lumberjack, this is the game for you!\n\n","April 18, 2015","true","4.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lowkae/recommended/2400/","Lowkae","Lowkae","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lowkae/","281 products in account","Summary: A unique, but flawed game with a very comical style.\n\nCheapest price: $1 in bundles from time to time. $5 when on sale (as of 12/2014).\n\nPros:\n-The hunt game mode is unique and works quite well. You're on a mad chase to find your quarry, but you're also on the lookout for your hunter. This idea was later copied by Bloody Good Time (this game's spiritual sequel) and Assassin's Creed, but I believe this is the original. Once the first kill occurs, a timer counts down until the end of the round, then the cycle repeats.\n-The stealth system works well. Pulling out a weapon or attacking someone in front of a guard sends you to jail immediately. Getting seen by other players starts a timer that will get you arrested in a few seconds once you pull out a weapon, with the timer being shorter if more players are watching you. This often forces you to wait for your quarry to go somewhere quiet before you can attack.\n-Player interactions on multiplayer servers are always fun. You're usually on edge for your hunter, so many of the players are aggressively defensive, resulting in awkward and hilarious encounters. You learn to fake people out to keep suspicion low, similar to multiplayer survival games (although there's no voice chat). You get good at distinguishing bots from human players and plan accordingly.\n-Maps are well designed and memorable. Most of the maps are built for arcade-style games, rather than focusing on realism, and the best way to get good at the game is to memorize the maps and spawn locations. Each map has authentic music from the 1900s-1920s (roughly) which gets stuck in your head after awhile. Also, there are secret rooms and passages which are fun to find.\n-The animations and sound design are.... interesting. The way people yelp and react when you hit them with household junk is hilarious when coupled with the pretentious period music playing in the background.\n\nCons:\n-The master server is permanently broken, so the in-game server browser doesn't work. Use the "View" tab, then "Servers" on Steam to join multiplayer games. This alone probably turns many people away when they don't see any games. However, there's probably an average of 30-50 people online at most times, peaking during the evenings in the US.\n-Some of the mechanics are dated and clunky. Your inventory is a mess to keep track of, and the way you can assign numbers to weapons is more trouble than its worth. Moving money in or out of the bank is slow and clunky. Looking at the map to track your quarry down takes too much time. Other mechanics such as paying money in the sickbay to heal yourself (you can't see your health), paying off guards for info or to ignore crimes (very effective if a guard is nearby),  and changing clothes to disguise yourself (not worth the time - just keep running) feel half-baked.\n-The needs system is excessive. You have eight needs: sleep, poop, pee, eat, drink, social, cleanliness, and excitement. Eight is a little excessive, and it's honestly often easier to get yourself killed and have them reset than to worry about them.\n-Winning an online game is too dependent on getting kills with high-paying weapons. After several rounds, the money-for-kills on most weapons goes up significantly. At this point finding the highest-paying weapons is crucial. Your needs and your hunter don't really matter, so long as you kill your quarry before you die. The jail fines, death penalties, and innocent kills fines aren't high enough to deter focused players from doing these things.\n-There's not very many good players in multiplayer. Of the 30-50 people you'll find online, maybe 10 at most are actually experienced. I probably win 50% of the time I play on any server, simply because I've played the game so much.\n-The other game modes besides hunt are dead. Back in 2006-2008 when the game was new you could find a server or two with deathmatch and VIP. Now you're almost always stuck with hunt.\n-The publisher doesn't have a license to edit the game, so the game essentially is going to stay in its current state indefinitely.\n\nOverall, a good but flawed game that is worth a few bucks if you want online multiplayer. If someone named "Cough" kills you, that's me.","December 23, 2014","true","156.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I'll just start by saying, in short, that this is genuinely the most unique, fantastic and fun Source game you'll find!\n\nThis Source remake of the GoldSrc version of The Ship is an incredible one at that - not only was the free, GoldSrc version a unique concept, but this just adds to that in the greatest way possible. Whilst it's now, disappointingly, quite a dead game, it's still incredibly fun with bots and when, if you manage to convince, you pull friends along just to murder them!\n\nIt's a rather casual game as opposed to TF2 or CS:GO, whilst Source has been known to have a very specific style to train for, The Ship is really easy to learn and gives you the pleasure of enjoying the engine even if you're not good at shooting or fighting in general as this game, obviously, isn't meant for constant fighting!\n\nI recommend the hell out of this - it's genuinely one of my top favourite games and has a brilliant structure to it, earning itself high marks simply due to this! Overall the gameplay and the theme it sets is definitely worth your while and can be enjoyed by even the simplest of players!","November 19, 2015","true","61.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

While you may have never heard of it, it is a suprisingly good game that can give you more hours of entertainment than you would have thought. This is a multiplayer game, even though it has an option for playing with AI, it isn't advanced enough to give you the same experience that an online game would give you.\n\nThere are a fair selection of maps to play on, all of them being cruise ships that appear to be set in the 1920s. The game plays a lot like Assassins Creed multiplayer, with some significant differences. Upon spawning you have to find your own weapons, you spawn in a cabin, which is filled with drawers of weapons, so initially finding them won't be a problem. The game also makes it so you can't get an overpowered weapon and dominate with it, since after a use the weapon is is sent to the bottom of the payout list, meaning continuing to use this weapon will give you a minimum score, making you find newer, more valuable weapons rather than keeping your old ones.\n\nThe game also features a needs system, similar to The Sims, which adds a whole nother level to gameplay. It forces you to move around the place to satisfy your needs, so you can't camp in a single spot to hide or try and ambush your target. You can change how hard it is to maintain needs, however you can't turn them off.\n\nThe core aspect of gameplay is the Assassins Creed-like hunting and killing of targets, stealthfully. While you're hunting your target, you are also being hunted by another player at all times. There are certain times when you can be safe, if you stand in an area with security cameras or guards, if anyone tries to attack you they will be stripped of their weapons, fined, and jailed. Also if you're around a large group of people, you're less likely to be attacked because having enough witnesses can also get you arresred.\n\nWhile the multiplayer servers are hard to get to, this game is still plenty of fun to play with friends. Whether it be over an online server or a simple LAN game, this is an extremely underrated game that has proven to be quite an enjoyable time to play. I reccomend that you at least give it a try, you'll be suprised that a game you have probably never heard of can serve you a quite a good time.","May 14, 2014","true","20.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

THIS GAME IS NOT DEAD! The default in game servers are dead yes. But the game is far from dead. To access the servers just go to view - servers - and then select 'The Ship' in the games tab. The Ship is about a crazy man only known as 'Mr. X' who threatens all the passengers that their families will be killed if they don't play his game. That's where you come in. You will be randomly generated as someone and your task is to find weapons and kill your target. Each weapon will get you a certain amount of money and once the weapon is used...it's borderline useless unless you wish to defend yourself with it. For such a simple game it's pretty in depth. You have needs you must take care of while killing your targets/avoiding your hunters. Which makes it more interesting. You win by having the most money. The amount of kills and deaths do not matter. I got killed many times and came out on top with just one kill with a very high money grabbing weapon in one match.  The two cons to this game are:\n1. If you don't have a weapon you are completely defenseless. You can't use your hands other than to push.\n2. People can block you in rooms and hallways making half the game about just trying to move a couple of inches at a time or just waiting for a loser to back away so you can exit through a door. It can get frustrating.\n\nPros (yeah it's weird starting with cons but there was less to say...good thing right?):\nA cool mix of 'The Sims' and 'Assassins Creed Multiplayer' with a goofy twist\nA quick jail system for when you get caught (great way to get all your needs done for free in one small area)\nDiverse weapons\n"Discovering" who people are. Talk to them to have an easier time knowing who to kill and where they are.\nDiverse maps (No there isn't just ship maps. I've been in a blimp map (which was horrible), a house map and a dock/tropical island map)\n\nOverall, this game is small but really in depth and addicting. I was gifted this game but I would easily have paid for it. My only original doubt was that the game was dead. And it most certainly isn't. 9/10","February 3, 2014","true","10.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ahoopyfrood/recommended/2400/","ahoopyfrood","AHoopyFrood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ahoopyfrood/","366 products in account","The Ship is one of the most layered and unique multiplayer games I've ever played (there is single player but this is best experienced with friends). It's a hunter style game where each player has a target and at least one player targeting them. The catch is you only have the name of your target and where they were last seen and you have no idea who's targeting you. You travel around the map collecting all sorts of strange weapons, each with a kill value attached (based on ease of use and how many kills have been made with it), trying to find your target by talking to the other players and bots, any of which could be looking for you. You can begin to see why this game is so tense. Once a player has been killed everyone else has a limited time to try and get their kill before the next round starts.\n\nThis is just the base layer though. On top of that you have to be careful where you kill your prey, as they're are guards and security cameras that will instantly take you to jail if you brandish a weapon in their site. Also committing a murder in front of to many player witnesses will have you serving time and paying a fee. If that wasn't enough, you also have to manage a number of The Sims-esque statuses. You have to eat and drink, use the bathroom and shower, participate in leisure activity, get enough social interaction, and most terrifying, sleep. All of these are tied into your actions, if you sprint you get hungry, thirsty, and tired. If you go to the bathroom your need to clean goes up, etc. If any of these aspects max out, you die.\n\nAll of this makes for a deep experience, lots of hilarious exchanges, and tense standoffs and hunts. The biggest issue is setting up and getting connected to multiplayer games. The in-game master server list is broken but you can look up guides for selecting a server before launching a game. For private games Steam does include a dedicated server tool or you can do what I did and set-up a VPN and play as a LAN game. Whatever route you take it is worth the effort.\n\nAlso of note: buying this is essentially buying 5 copies of the game. You get one and 2 gifts. The people that receive those gift copies each get one additional gift copy. Coordinate with your friends and the base price is less than five dollars a copy. If you find it on sale then the price per copy can drop to under a dollar a piece.","June 30, 2014","true","17.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A rather odd but nifty combo of covertly detouring your target somewhere away from the prying eyes of security and fellow members of the cruise, keeping a keen eye on what items will grant you the most valuable kills, and all the while making sure to keep your money safe and your personal needs satisfied. Imagine elements of The Sims thrown into Assassin's Creed: Revelations multiplayer... on a cruise. Odd thought.\n\nGet a big group of friends together for the inevitable arguments, screams over wallet bombs, and hasty searching through prison bedside drawers for the one shank available. You can even decide to play with World Leaders. Who would win in a fight: Margaret Thatcher with a frying pan, or Ronald Reagan with a croquet mallet?

It incorporates authentic music and surrounding to give you a real feeling of being aboard a ship in the time period and you have a vast amount of objects that can be used to kill your quarry that keep the game interesting and fun to play. The main problem a lot of people have is that they can't find a server because the mster server is down, but this issue can be circumnavigated by directly connecting to a server using this site http://www.gameserverdirectory.com/search/the-ship/ .  Just copy one of the ips (I recommend RKSzone as it is the most played)  and go into your favorites tab and find the option "add server to your favorites by ip" and paste it there and you should be able to join.

While you may have never heard of it, it is a suprisingly good game that can give you more hours of entertainment than you would have thought. This is a multiplayer game, even though it has an option for playing with AI, it isn't advanced enough to give you the same experience that an online game would give you.\n\nThere are a fair selection of maps to play on, all of them being cruise ships that appear to be set in the 1920s. The game plays a lot like Assassins Creed multiplayer, with some significant differences. Upon spawning you have to find your own weapons, you spawn in a cabin, which is filled with drawers of weapons, so initially finding them won't be a problem. The game also makes it so you can't get an overpowered weapon and dominate with it, since after a use the weapon is is sent to the bottom of the payout list, meaning continuing to use this weapon will give you a minimum score, making you find newer, more valuable weapons rather than keeping your old ones.\n\nThe game also features a needs system, similar to The Sims, which adds a whole nother level to gameplay. It forces you to move around the place to satisfy your needs, so you can't camp in a single spot to hide or try and ambush your target. You can change how hard it is to maintain needs, however you can't turn them off.\n\nThe core aspect of gameplay is the Assassins Creed-like hunting and killing of targets, stealthfully. While you're hunting your target, you are also being hunted by another player at all times. There are certain times when you can be safe, if you stand in an area with security cameras or guards, if anyone tries to attack you they will be stripped of their weapons, fined, and jailed. Also if you're around a large group of people, you're less likely to be attacked because having enough witnesses can also get you arresred.\n\nWhile the multiplayer servers are hard to get to, this game is still plenty of fun to play with friends. Whether it be over an online server or a simple LAN game, this is an extremely underrated game that has proven to be quite an enjoyable time to play. I reccomend that you at least give it a try, you'll be suprised that a game you have probably never heard of can serve you a quite a good time.","May 14, 2014","true","20.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And even if the entire game sucked, the spasms people go through when you chuck something at them would make up for it, or maybe not because you might die from laughter. The only problem is mediocre graphics, but for i personally love them, they make it just cartoony enough. Nice community, only a few servers though. A nice selection of cruises, another problem is navigatio, a minimap would be nice. 11/10, would have bought just the multiplayer for $20\n\nSingleplayer: meh, some missions were good, some were not. Good ones in order from best to mediocre: captain murder, Ambassador helper, Bruno's Citizen Slaughter ,prison shanker\nBad from mediocre to terrible: getting into control room and escape, saving Mrs. Tweed's dog, Doppleganger domination.\nyes yes i know not all were included\n\ntutorial: not really necessary, the game plays like a regular shooter aside from "i" being inventory and middle click holstering weapon.\n\nAll: do like the rarity of guns and the weapon choice (prison shanks >: ). soundtracks are nice, best menu theme ever.\n\nsummary: buy now\n\nalso a few hints and tips: claymore is OP (as the AWP) and on the same level as winchester. when out of bullets you can still throw the gun. you can push people overboard on multiplayer. I an 75% sure that empty needles dont do damage so never have only that unless you can inject and get away.\nFlare guns respawn very fast, a good strategy for the game is fill you inventory with flares and shoot, throw, shoot, throw, etc. until you run out of flares. 1 shot 1 kill for flares. flare strategy is best used for the singleplayer gunbattle. Also another strategy is have half sleeping potions and half flares so you never miss.","February 5, 2014","true","167.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Since this game is rather old now, it comes with 2 Steam gifts of the Ship bundle (Single player and The Ship), so if you and a group of friends wanted to play together, a couple of you buy it and gift the rest of them and one of them could host a server. The single player is also fun. It's not amazing, it's rather tedious, actually.

Sarcastic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/docsarcastic/","356 products in account","Personal Rating: 7/10\n\nThis game is fun, however what would be more fun is if people actually played the game still. I mean, trading cards were added which is great for me as I like to craft the badges, but how many players did that honestly SHIP in. There are a variety of weapons, outfits and items to choose from that can kill and maim your shipmates, from Frying Pan to Flare Gun, you can pretty much use anything to your advantage.\n\nIf you have a few friends that would like to play this game, then you can get it pretty cheap in the sales now-a-days and set up your own server. I did it a while back and we had hours of fun. Of course, to stick a twist on the endless murders, you need to keep yourself alive and cater to your basic needs such as sleeping, showering, eating and talking to people. The simplest of tasks become so tense as anyone can just sneak up on you while you shower and blow your face off with a shotgun.\n\nSo, should you buy this game? If you can get it on the sale, sure, but if you're buying it for full price then be prepared to be dissapointed at the lack of players. You could always play the single-player though which is fun...","December 6, 2014","true","5.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And even if the entire game sucked, the spasms people go through when you chuck something at them would make up for it, or maybe not because you might die from laughter. The only problem is mediocre graphics, but for i personally love them, they make it just cartoony enough. Nice community, only a few servers though. A nice selection of cruises, another problem is navigatio, a minimap would be nice. 11/10, would have bought just the multiplayer for $20\n\nSingleplayer: meh, some missions were good, some were not. Good ones in order from best to mediocre: captain murder, Ambassador helper, Bruno's Citizen Slaughter ,prison shanker\nBad from mediocre to terrible: getting into control room and escape, saving Mrs. Tweed's dog, Doppleganger domination.\nyes yes i know not all were included\n\ntutorial: not really necessary, the game plays like a regular shooter aside from "i" being inventory and middle click holstering weapon.\n\nAll: do like the rarity of guns and the weapon choice (prison shanks >: ). soundtracks are nice, best menu theme ever.\n\nsummary: buy now\n\nalso a few hints and tips: claymore is OP (as the AWP) and on the same level as winchester. when out of bullets you can still throw the gun. you can push people overboard on multiplayer. I an 75% sure that empty needles dont do damage so never have only that unless you can inject and get away.\nFlare guns respawn very fast, a good strategy for the game is fill you inventory with flares and shoot, throw, shoot, throw, etc. until you run out of flares. 1 shot 1 kill for flares. flare strategy is best used for the singleplayer gunbattle. Also another strategy is have half sleeping potions and half flares so you never miss.","February 5, 2014","true","167.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The mechanics used in The Ship perfectly highlight the entertaining chaos that happens during the hectic rounds.\n\nThe maps are ingeniously crafted with care at every corner, plus the graphics are cartoony meaning it still looks fantastic even after 8 years of time since its release.\n\nHonestly, I wish more people played this game. It's a shame that its main server went down, but many servers are still filled with enthusiastic players to provide an enjoyable, fun experience.\n\nWhen you buy The Ship, two free copies are given to you to give to your friends.

It involves you searching to kill the person asined to you but also someone is trying to kill you at the same time.  Their are 2 games for the ship, a multiplayer and single player.  Also their is a tutorial for the ship in case anyone needs halp for it which is pretty neat because it's free.  I don't care for the graphics of a game that much but they are not the best, but that kind of brings a funny side to the game which I enjoy.  The single palyer is intersting to say the least and since the game can basically run on any computer playing with you friends can be fun and by everyone.  The story line isn't amazing and without a doubt is kind of dumb.  The game is okay but I would give it a 6.5.","January 7, 2012","true","15.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Last time I played, it only had a few servers with one or two players in it.\n\nTHE REVIEW: I have played this game for two hours on this account, but at a friends I have logged a few more (I didn't buy the game until recently during a sale). It's a friggin fun game to play against your buddies, or against randoms. Trying to actually go about and eat, drink, shower, sleep, bathroom, etc while trying to kill someone is always awesome. The game gives you more points for killing someone with a non-typical weapon (umbrella, hammer, fish, etc) instead of a gun or bomb. They also have getting arrested, and security cameras, so killing someone can get pretty tricky (hell, you can ever kill someone while in jail). It's a really fun game. I would normally recommend it, and I do, but it's sad it doesn't have a lot of people playing it anymore. If you bought it now, you'd probably be disappointed with the lack of playerbase.","June 21, 2015","true","2.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The 6 hours I have have all come after I bought the game yesterday. It's that addicting and fun. But here are my pros and cons:\nPros:\nAddicting gameplay\nGood selection and rotation of maps\nServers are very good, not much desync\nAmazing concept\nGood graphics.\nThe needs system is cool, and you need to balance that and hunting your target.\nGood character randomization. You don't see the same character twice.\nWeaponary choice.\nWorld leaders mode\n\nCons:\nThere's only one or two servers with people, so you're a bit limited, but it doesn't stop you from playing with other people.\nThe graphics look a bit dated, but that just adds to the charm of the game.\nIt's hard to get around in a stairway or tiny little hall, since people's hitboxes are fairly large.\n\nOverall I'd say this game is a 9.5/10. Just minor things that won't hinder your experience at all. If you're looking for a cheap, fun game that'll soak up hours, then this game is for you. If you're looking to do world leaders with friends, and want to kill Bush as bin Laden, then this game is for you. If you wanna inject someone with poison, and run away as they slowly die, this game is for you. And, most of all, if you enjoy blowing people across the room with a blunderbuss, and then getting shot yourself with a tommy gun because karma hunter, then this game is for you.\n\n","June 16, 2015","true","11.7"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Since this game is rather old now, it comes with 2 Steam gifts of the Ship bundle (Single player and The Ship), so if you and a group of friends wanted to play together, a couple of you buy it and gift the rest of them and one of them could host a server. The single player is also fun. It's not amazing, it's rather tedious, actually. But, despite that it's still a lot of fun,  and I think you shouldn't overlook it.\nAnyways, I think the ship is worth getting and it's a whole lot of fun.

It really holds up well, despite being built on the earlier source engine. I love playing this game with a group of friends. It's highly competitive without adding too much tension between each other, so it's a great lan game, party game, or just casual go-to game. Adding bots adds an extra layer of difficulty because people love pretending to be bots, and having multiple game-modes helps change it up from time to time.\nI recommend disabling the music after a while.","January 16, 2015","true","37.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bulinger96/recommended/2400/","bulinger96","Mr. Taxxon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bulinger96/","84 products in account","In this game, a small group of people are each given an individual in the same group to murder. This means that whilst you are trying to find your own quarry, there is someone else trying to find you. It is a battle of wits, your mind against everyone elses mind. As you play this, you will develop acting strategies to make it look like you aren't following someone, such as hiding and watching from afar in crowds or around corners until they leave the secured areas, or following them directly but also taking different paths to their destination. There is a wide array of maps, from the tight small arctic bearing Krassin, to the lovely compact wide open Connemara, to the enormous vigorous Cyclops. Each with a vastly different asthetic style. As of now this game has zero dedicated servers, however, the single player arcade mode is great fun. And if you can get two or more friends to join alongside you, it makes for a great night.","January 31, 2014","true","16.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Usually, games like this get you to kill without taking into account about your needs. This game is perfect because it balances the needs and wants of the character just enough to make it believable. Sure sometimes the needs get annoying but that's part of the game.\nI also like the overall challenge of the game as a whole. The multiple game modes are great and the maps are awesome. My only concern is that I think there should be a workshop for people who want to make and publish maps. I think this mostly because once you've played all the maps, they get slightly boring.\nBut besides that, great game! I definitely recommend this for people who like action, and spy related stuff. 9/10!","June 15, 2015","true","21.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

The mechanics used in The Ship perfectly highlight the entertaining chaos that happens during the hectic rounds.\n\nThe maps are ingeniously crafted with care at every corner, plus the graphics are cartoony meaning it still looks fantastic even after 8 years of time since its release.\n\nHonestly, I wish more people played this game. It's a shame that its main server went down, but many servers are still filled with enthusiastic players to provide an enjoyable, fun experience.\n\nWhen you buy The Ship, two free copies are given to you to give to your friends.

Last time I played, it only had a few servers with one or two players in it.\n\nTHE REVIEW: I have played this game for two hours on this account, but at a friends I have logged a few more (I didn't buy the game until recently during a sale). It's a friggin fun game to play against your buddies, or against randoms. Trying to actually go about and eat, drink, shower, sleep, bathroom, etc while trying to kill someone is always awesome. The game gives you more points for killing someone with a non-typical weapon (umbrella, hammer, fish, etc) instead of a gun or bomb. They also have getting arrested, and security cameras, so killing someone can get pretty tricky (hell, you can ever kill someone while in jail). It's a really fun game. I would normally recommend it, and I do, but it's sad it doesn't have a lot of people playing it anymore. If you bought it now, you'd probably be disappointed with the lack of playerbase.","June 21, 2015","true","2.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is definitely some of the most fun I've had playing online.\n\nThis game may be old, but it's gameplay modes are so simple yet so fun to play. The mechanics used in The Ship perfectly highlight the entertaining chaos that happens during the hectic rounds.\n\nThe maps are ingeniously crafted with care at every corner, plus the graphics are cartoony meaning it still looks fantastic even after 8 years of time since its release.\n\nHonestly, I wish more people played this game. It's a shame that its main server went down, but many servers are still filled with enthusiastic players to provide an enjoyable, fun experience.\n\nWhen you buy The Ship, two free copies are given to you to give to your friends. If that doesn't sell it to you, I don't know what will.\n\nYou should play this game.","December 21, 2014","true","14.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Let me tell you.\n\nTo begin: I was gifted a copy of this game by a friend. That's cool, right? That means I didn't have to pay. However, when you buy a copy of The Ship, you get given not one, but TWO extra codes (alongside your own copy of the game) to give to whoever the hell you want- and it gets even better. Paired with these two extra codes is another code to be gifted! That essentially means when someone buys The Ship, they own five copies (but can only gift two - the other two copies have to be gifted by the gifted... if that makes any sense.)\nSo I was gifted this game, hopped onto Skype with my buddy and we immediately begin playing.\nI was not disappointed.\nThe game runs entirely on the Source engine - meaning that you don't need some high-end PC to be able to play it well. For it's time, 2006, the graphics are absolutely fantastic and can be modified to your liking. The game runs smooth with no graphical bugs that I have noticed as of yet, and that's with a mere couple of hours of gameplay time.\nIt's quick and simple to enter and create games - simply hop onto the server list or set up your own dedicated server through whatever means necessary. Each server is created exactly like another Source-based server, so you'll have no issues there.\nOnce you've entered the game, you'll be given a choice - to be a hunter or a passenger. Each player is given a random identity despite their role, with a randomised name and look. As a hunter, you're given a random contract that you have to seek out and kill on the boat - whilst remaining hidden from security guards and cameras. The two problems are this: you don't know what your contract looks like (unless you've already discovered them), and you too are being hunted. The aim of each game is to gain as much cash as possible, earned from getting the most wackiest and crazy kills on your contracts. The player at the end of the round with the most cash wins. Simple.\nThere is a pretty large selection of maps to choose from, meaning that you won't be on the same cruise twice in a row. Alongside this, NPC's (called Shipmates) can be added, adding a challenge to finding the correct target. You also have to eat, sleep, shower and entertain yourself, so it's not all about focusing on slaughtering others.\nThink of this game like a game of Murder Mystery - you don't know who you're looking for, and you don't know who's looking for you.\nThat's it gameplay wise. The rest is up to you - if you like the fast-paced, first person murder-mystery genres then this game is for you. Enjoy.\n\n(There's a video on my YouTube channel if you wish to see a visual representation of this review!)\n\nI definitely recommend this game.","June 20, 2014","true","4.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Usually, games like this get you to kill without taking into account about your needs. This game is perfect because it balances the needs and wants of the character just enough to make it believable. Sure sometimes the needs get annoying but that's part of the game.\nI also like the overall challenge of the game as a whole. The multiple game modes are great and the maps are awesome. My only concern is that I think there should be a workshop for people who want to make and publish maps. I think this mostly because once you've played all the maps, they get slightly boring.\nBut besides that, great game!

For all intents and purposes, this is a first-person interpretation of Steve Jackson's "Killer" live action game, but set in a tighter environment and with more weapon variety. With that in mind it even has shades of the excellent pre-murder-mystery game "Kill Doctor Lucky".\n\nNow, you might think that a game that, intentionally or not, reflects these other sources may be a bit derivative, but it really isn't. Indeed it is a particularly refreshing thing to be playing, not quite as frenetic as the FPS games out there, but lacking the long-term sense of digging in that the survival games have. It really does sit nicely in its niche and seems likely to occupy those periods where I need a quick blast of multi-player gaming that requires the use of my rarely deployed sense of deviousness.\n\nGraphically it isn't amazing, but it is still certainly appealing and a good job is done setting the different shipboard environments.\n\nmore than anything though, this game is probably going to generate a lot of anecdotal moments and that is increasingly rare these days.\n\nSure, the graphics aren't top notch, the sound is atmospheric but not rich and the environments are not sprawling (and this is a good thing), but what we have is a great little self-contained game that deserves ongoing attention.

For all intents and purposes, this is a first-person interpretation of Steve Jackson's "Killer" live action game, but set in a tighter environment and with more weapon variety. With that in mind it even has shades of the excellent pre-murder-mystery game "Kill Doctor Lucky".\n\nNow, you might think that a game that, intentionally or not, reflects these other sources may be a bit derivative, but it really isn't. Indeed it is a particularly refreshing thing to be playing, not quite as frenetic as the FPS games out there, but lacking the long-term sense of digging in that the survival games have. It really does sit nicely in its niche and seems likely to occupy those periods where I need a quick blast of multi-player gaming that requires the use of my rarely deployed sense of deviousness.\n\nGraphically it isn't amazing, but it is still certainly appealing and a good job is done setting the different shipboard environments.\n\nmore than anything though, this game is probably going to generate a lot of anecdotal moments and that is increasingly rare these days.\n\nSure, the graphics aren't top notch, the sound is atmospheric but not rich and the environments are not sprawling (and this is a good thing), but what we have is a great little self-contained game that deserves ongoing attention. Well worth the price of admission.","August 17, 2015","true","35.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This would be hard finding an optimum server that has low ping and can support your friends aswell, the website http://www.gameserverdirectory.com/search/the-ship/ should be a primary guide for you to find a server but it has limited servers and many empty ones.

This would be hard finding an optimum server that has low ping and can support your friends aswell, the website http://www.gameserverdirectory.com/search/the-ship/ should be a primary guide for you to find a server but it has limited servers and many empty ones.

The following is a brief review of the game: The Ship (But you already knew that..)\n\nDuring my current 4.8 hour gametime, I've come to enjoy this game. The goal of this game is rather noticeable when you join in: Kill your Quarry. Though it's not that simple though. Crew members and security will stop you in your tracks if they even catch you in their line of sight. Different weapons reward different amounts of money and will reduce in worth the more you use it, so have several weapons on hand, as they may increase in value later. There is one huge catch though, you have to avoid your hunter. This game hurts you when you kill someone that either isn't your quarry or your hunter by taking away money, so confirm that you know even the slightest bit that the grandmother down the hallway to the left isn't waiting for you with a Tommy Gun and wanting her purse you stole from her last game.\n\nThere are needs in the game, these include going to the bathroom, eating, drinking, sleeping and the like. You even need to read after some point, apparently the signs aren't enough. It's good to know where everything is on the map, so even if you're new to the game, it's better if you play against bots to get the feel for the game. I've learned alot by doing that.\n\nThere's a single player mode to this game that comes with the purchase but as a completely seperate app along with the tutorial. The single player is rather slow and boring but can teach you a thing or two about reaction time and money loss in this game, all while teaching you about how the game really happened and why the hell that creepy masked guy is in the bottom right hand corner of your screen when you've killed someone.\n\nIf you do plan on getting this game for multiplayer it should be noted that you may have to download Hamachi for this game, I've had issues with joining while not having it, or anything along the lines of it. Otherwise you have to join a public lobby and have randoms join.\n\nThis game in my opinion is a 9.1/10. It provides endless amounts of mood swings when your good friend tosses a golf club at your head, it's funny and then you get mad at him for killing you. It's somewhat worth the 10$, but should be bought when it's on sale if none of your friends have it. I can't wait for the remake.","July 2, 2015","true","8.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

I understand that some people may want to wait and buy that version. But if you love classics and originals, this version is still definitely worth it.\n\nThe Ship holds a special place in my heart for many reasons. There's a lot to love: The numerous game modes, the strategy and suspence, the humor (if blowing people up on the toilet is your sort of thing). Looking at the game from a non-biased, technical point of view, yeah, there are flaws. The graphics are a bit dated, and every once and a while there are render glitches. But those two flaws are easily ignored, especially the graphics, which in my opinion suit the game very well. If you're looking for a fun game, or strategy, or controversy (World Leaders game modes), or just plain bashing heads in with umbrellas, this game is for you.","June 13, 2015","true","37.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rhykevance/recommended/2400/","Rhykevance","Sharisad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rhykevance/","1008 products in account","Just as "Zombie Panic: Source" this multiplayer game (there is a singleplayer but I've never played it, it's meant to be a multiplayer title) is more relaxing and fun than most other FPS are. It's not strictly an FPS; though you are playing from the ego-perspective and your goal is to kill your enemies using guns and melee, it has rather simple but gameplay-wise important "needs" to be taken care of by the players one may know from life-simulations like "The Sims".\n\nEach player is assigned a specific player to kill when he spawns. You are given his vague position on the ship. You must find him and kill him within a specific time limit with one of many weapons found on the map. Each weapon gives you a different amount of money on kill. If all people kill with the very easily-and-everywhere-found fire axe they won't get much money. So you search all decks and rooms for more rewarding tools, while you constantly must look out not to get stabbed from behind by the player who is supposed to hunt you (which identity you don't know; there are random player models and you can merely guess who is your hunter by paying attention to the behaviour of the players). At the same time you need to take care of common needs like eating, drinking, sleeping and all - which again makes you vulnerable; of course the same applies to your quarry, so waiting for a good chance to get close to him is important. You also need to avoid security guards, cameras and other players serving as "witnesses" - if you don't you are put in the ship jail, losing some money and important time. Sometimes you are lucky/unlucky enough to have your quarry/hunter put in there too; if you find a self-made knife in one of the prison cells that gives you a seldom chance to get rid of him. There are traps on the ships like saunas, lifeboat releases or cooling chambers, but it rarely happens you get to kill your target with those.\n\nThis basic concept leads to many unique and funny moments. There are other modes like Deathmatch and VIP in which there are two teams who must defend their own VIP and hunt down the one of the opposing team, but those are rarely played. Unfortunately so is the regular hunting mode, because there are almost no servers left to play on. The game was badly advertised and has almost died, if it was ever alive to begin with. There are Steam groups promoting the game and trying to get players to play it, but even that only leads to one or two fully-crowded servers at best.\n\nUbisoft who has or had the rights on the title adapted this hunt-or-be-hunted concept in the Assassin's Creed series. I played the multiplayer of Brotherhood on my PS3 once, and while it was sort of entertaining I didn't get to like it too much. I would still prefer "The Ship". A sequel "Bloody Good Time" in a hollywood/movies scenario was released, but it doesn't look like Outerlight had much more luck with that. They are no more and the rights on "The Ship" apparently went to a company called "Blazing Griffing", who intends to produce a sequel called "The Ship: Full Steam Ahead" (http://www.blazinggriffin.com/the-ship-full-steam-ahead), but only if they get enough support from ordinary people: You can help them fund their so-called "Kickstarter" project here: http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/709089895/the-ship-full-steam-ahead","December 22, 2012","true","18.9"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

You control one of many passengers on said ship hunting one another, I mostly played the multiplayer version of this game. Whilst doing so, my character needed to use the toilet, as each player also has to watch there characters basic needs. So on my way I noticed my target, they noticed I was out for them and ran towards the toilet. They ran in there realising it was a dead end, closing the door. I opened the door whilst equiped with a Blunderbuss then quickly shooting him in the face, he died sitting on the toilet.","July 17, 2014","true","5.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

The entire concept of having to be on board a ship full of murderers including yourself makes this rich, as well as having it very well balanced.  the fact that it adds many variables that you need to keep in check on top of killing adds difficulty and immersion to the game, and there's many opportunities for you to kill people as well as get killed. It's splendid and I'd recommend it if you can play LAN with a couple friends.\n\nMy only gripe is the fact that there are no more dedicated servers to host multiplayer matches.  I hate this because playing with real people makes it more intense as you need to think who may be a real person or an AI, and it's a lot more fun to kill someone knowing they'll have a reaction.  On top of that; the games AI isn't very smart either.  They'll hardly ever attack you, or sometimes it's easy to know that they're hunting you. Still it's a great game and with how cheap it is with sales it's worth it for the experience.","November 3, 2014","true","34.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Not to mention it's quite cheap and comes with 5(!) copies. You are on an early '30 cruise ship and you have to kill a randomly assigned passenger. However, another passenger is also gunning for you. The big twist is that you must kill your target without people noticing. You'll be arrested if you pull out a weapon in front of a crowd. it's like one of those hidden identity type board/card game.  The closest analogy for this game is probably Assassin's Creed multiplayer.\n\nSome of the mechanics don't hold up very well when experienced people go full tryhard mode (it's almost like a different game in that case). In-game server browser is also broken. Additionally, a lot of the server are not stress tested at all, (due to low player number) causing unplayable laggy game when there's too many players on a server.\n\nThis is a great game to play at LAN parties or play with a bunch of friends. I recommend playing with 8 or more players, and without bots. Buy a 5-packs or two, it's cheaper than almost any board game you can buy, and enjoy a great weekend of get away on The Ship.","February 3, 2014","true","17.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

A minute or so had passed by, and my friend's quarry had become discomforted by his persistence in following them, and attempted to kill him with an umbrella of all things, my friend, who had found a blunderbuss (As a shotgun as oppose to the pistol form) proceeded to blast his quarry in the face with a singular shot to the stomach. Seconds after the fight i saw my opportunity and took it, i got a  mannequin arm and accidently threw it at his legs, killing him instantly (Some how). Straight after the event i spurted out a pun so bad that made the fact that i just murdered a good friend of mine alright (Some how) "Oh woops, ha well, you did say you needed a HAND before, didn't you", He then replies with "Well Matt, i have to HAND it to you, you did do as i asked". I ended the conversation by saying "Well David, i am a bit of a man at arms..." and then half the server got mowed down by a person with a tommy gun( also known as the "Trench Broom", "Trench Sweeper" "Chicago Typewriter",  and the M1927) try to recreate the saint valentine's day massacre","August 31, 2015","true","5.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

You control one of many passengers on said ship hunting one another, I mostly played the multiplayer version of this game.

So on my way I noticed my target, they noticed I was out for them and ran towards the toilet. They ran in there realising it was a dead end, closing the door. I opened the door whilst equiped with a Blunderbuss then quickly shooting him in the face, he died sitting on the toilet.","July 17, 2014","true","5.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

It has aged slightly well with the graphics looking like they came from a early PS1 game. I'm not saying this is a bad this necessarily, but it does feel clunky at times. The controls for this game aren't terrible, but they are awkward for some things like opening containers. Before even starting the game I would recommend watching a quick gameplay video, there really isn't a worthwhile tutorial. I haven't logged many hours into this game so I can't talk about the replayability. From what I have played I have enjoyed. The Ship doesn't have any murder mystery solving so don't come in expecting that. It's a unique FPS that I highly recommend.\n\n8.5/10\n\nBigBulge69","May 29, 2015","true","5.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

A minute or so had passed by, and my friend's quarry had become discomforted by his persistence in following them, and attempted to kill him with an umbrella of all things, my friend, who had found a blunderbuss (As a shotgun as oppose to the pistol form) proceeded to blast his quarry in the face with a singular shot to the stomach. Seconds after the fight i saw my opportunity and took it, i got a  mannequin arm and accidently threw it at his legs, killing him instantly (Some how). Straight after the event i spurted out a pun so bad that made the fact that i just murdered a good friend of mine alright (Some how) "Oh woops, ha well, you did say you needed a HAND before, didn't you", He then replies with "Well Matt, i have to HAND it to you, you did do as i asked". I ended the conversation by saying "Well David, i am a bit of a man at arms..." and then half the server got mowed down by a person with a tommy gun( also known as the "Trench Broom", "Trench Sweeper" "Chicago Typewriter",  and the M1927) try to recreate the saint valentine's day massacre","August 31, 2015","true","5.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"
