Runs perfectly in DOSBox, the controls are tight with a 360 controller, and it sounds great with those old fashioned buzzes and blorps I wish every video game had, not just the ones made before 1993. There are three episodes with 16 levels each, so that's a lot of puzzle-platforming greatness for a buck or two. The creator, Frank Maddin, would go on to work on notable games such as the 1997 Shadow Warrior and its 2013 sequel, Donkey Kong Country Returns, and Metroid Prime 3, among others.","May 5, 2015","true","0.9"," 29 of 37 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","29","37","2","3"

I feel so happy to play it again and with no problem with the port (there's no need to look for the emulator and write directly the address, what a relief!)\n\nAnd now we have the opportunity (because my whole family played the game as well!) to play it once more and with all the episodes!!!\n\nIs a whole new world to us and we must to discover it now!!!\n\n\n\nI think I'm gonna cry.","November 29, 2015","true","0.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

The controls are pretty good for the era and the game's fun, but it's fun in an NES kind of way. There are a lot of very poor level design decisions that will likely gnaw on anyone who didn't grow up with this kind of stuff. The worst example of this is the hub level on episode 3, where you literally cannot get out of the top left if you jump into it rendering the game unfinishable if you saved there. The shareware episode is much better than the registered episodes IMO.","May 10, 2015","true","4.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

This would have to be my favorite 2D platformer I have ever played. You get the shareware version of the game and 2 episodes of paid versions. This game is great I have not played such a relaxing fun challenging platformer quite like this before. The game has zero gravity upside down levels underwater levels and a ton of interesting levels. This game is a classic that I have played when I was younger on my windows 98 when I had the shareware version. What I liked about the game then was just playing the game back then I learned that my PC had a built in speaker that made the classic sound effects that you hear in the game.\n\nHow good is the port? It works just like it did for me on my windows 98 many years back. I have had no issues with the game the controls are excellent, the game looks great and I can run this on any PC I have basically. When I got the game I was hoping it would work with my xbox controller and I figured it would be a pain to set up but it worked as I plugged the controller in. This is a great game and a very good port that could have a bit more to it maybe but for 5 dollars getting 3 episodes of crystal caves that as far as I can tell will run on any PC I own and has good controller support why not get it?","June 2","true","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was about seven when this game first came out. I remember we used to have a bunch of CDs that had all kinds of games (Hugo's House of Horrors, Maddog Williams, etc) and the shareware version of Crystal Caves was on at least one of those discs. It was always one of my favorite games to play on our old PC. I would spend hours trying to perfect each level of the first episode.\n\nSeeing it on Steam today made me very happy! It's hard to believe I can still breeze through the first episode like it was the early 90s. As far as I can tell everything is exactly the same. Same awesome sound effects, graphics, and story. Except this time I'm piloting Mylo through the stages with my xbox controller instead of my keyboard. Feels a lot less stressful, but then again I've only played the first episode. I'm sure the frustration will return when I start episode two and three of which I'm unfamiliar with (hehe).\n\nIt's nice to see Steam releasing some older DOS games for the nostalgic (like myself) and for todays gamers. This is one oldie you don't want to miss. It's fun and goofy and one of those games you don't want to stop until you complete it.","March 15","true","1.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

After playing through it and checking out similar modern games, it's pretty obvious why.\n\n1. The game's replayability is based off of a high score system, but simply staying in a leel and picking up  the randomly appearing fruits will allow you to get a higher score than anyone else.\n2. Obvious things that it looks like you should be able to do (such as jumping into a gap big enough for the main character) can't always be done, with some trial and erro (or memory of the old game) required to remind you of which.\n3. It is entirely possible to lock yourself out of being able to complete levels (or even access them in the third game) without realising it.\n\nIf you remember the game from your childhood, and want to relive the nostalgia, then this is probably one of the better ways to do it. But the game has not aged very well, in comparison to similar games from the era, let alone from the modern climate, and so, I honestly can't recommend it.","September 27, 2015","false","1.7"," 5 of 18 people (28%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","28","5","18","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/serpentstare/recommended/358260/","serpentstare","serpentstare","http://steamcommunity.com/id/serpentstare/","128 products in account","Crystal Caves is a simple, old-fashioned 2D puzzle platformer, bearing some similarity to the very first Duke Nukem.\nEach level, you need to figure out what order to do things in so that you can take out the baddies, grab all the goodies, and make it to the exit alive; it's easy to die or sometimes to get trapped so you have to quit and re-enter the level, but if you're fast and clever enough you may be able to succeed without taking a single hit for a massive score bonus. You can take as many tries as you need to beat each level (no lives limit), which makes the challenging puzzles much more forgiving, and if you get frustrated, you can go back to the main map and platform to a different level for a change of pace.\nThe story is silly and the action simplistic, but with Steam automatically setting up and configuring a dosbox for it, this is an easy way to relive the old days.\nFrom a modern perspective? It's not all that exciting, but if you like retro simplicity, or are craving nostalgia, it's not bad either.","January 30","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
