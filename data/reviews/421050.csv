Little do you know it ends the exact same, the point of the whole game is to try and show you that no matter what you try everything comes to an end, and if you try to change it maybe something worse can happen... at least that's how I saw it... but c'mon, they knew what all their fans wanted and they could easily have given it to them, but instead they give exactly the same ending as before (well, not exactly, but almost the same).\n\nIt is not until after seeing the ending that you feel empty and realize all you have done (which is a lot) has lead to practically nothing... Then you try to cope with it thinking that it could have been worse, and then you feel empty again because it doesn't fill that hole. The reason why I recommend this game is because I had fun overall playing it and it has all the good things that the other games had, and I liked them a lot.\n\nThe ending is not THAT bad if you managed to get over the Goodbye Deponia ending though, just like I did.\n\nI really hope/wish there's a sequel, and in case they plan on doing it, I really look forward to know more about it.","March 5","true","15.7"," 37 of 49 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","37","49","0","0"

(Brazilian Portuguese)\nReview of Deponia Doomsday.(English one - A bit below)\n\nVersão Brasileira\nResumo: Deponia Doomsday é um belo jogo da franquia Deponia baseado no estilo de aventura , point-and-click (ou seja, basicamente tudo que você faz no  jogo é na base do clique) e comedia. Criado pela Daedalic entertaiment Deponia conta a historia de Rufus um cara que esta cansado do mundo pos-apocaliptico e devastado pela poluição no qual ele habita (Deponia), e tenta de tudo pra deixar a sua cidade (Kuvaq) e chegar a Elysium , uma cidade planando no céu livre de toda a triste realidade que ele vive. Sua jornada nesse jogo é guiar rufus até elysium (novamente^^) mas dessa vez você tem a habilidade de viajar através do tempo e espaço O 0 O.\n\nGraficos: O que dizer dos graficos... Deponia Doomsday como sempre esta lindo, os desenhos são bem definidos , cada linha e detalhe feito com  bastante equilibrio entre efeitos animados e realisticos, a daedalic como sempre deslumbra e brilha nesse aspecto.\n\nTrilha Sonora: Esse é outro aspecto em que o jogo realmente brilha , deponia possui uma trilha sonora original , envolvente , empolgante e emocionante (tudo ao mesmo tempo). Sem contar que cada capitulo da historia é introduzida com uma canção, original, cativante e MUITO engraçado, chamada as canções do Huzzah (link de uma das canções):\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcDkBH6BYyk\n\nGameplay: Como todo o jogo point-and-click nao havia muito o que mudar nesse quesito, porém , a daedalic se superou e tornou o gameplay em varias partes do jogo bastante interativo , o que adicionou bastante ação em varias situações.\n\nJogos point-and-click são muitas vezes descartados , e nao recebem muita atenção por que o publico acredita que o estilo vai ser tedioso e nao muito interessante.Deponia veio provar que todos que pensavam assim (Inclusive eu)estavam errados,o jogo é muito bonito, a historia é bastante interessante, e MUITO MAIS MUITO engraçada. Eu desafio você a jogar deponia e nao rir pelo menos algumas vezes.Sinceramente é um dos melhores jogos Indie/point-and-click que ja joguei.\n\nPS: O Deponia Doomsday vem em português^^ boa noticia para os brasileiros.\n\n\n\nEnglish Version\nSummary: Deponia Doomsday is a beautiful game from the Deponia franchise , based on the adventur/point-and-click style (it means, that you basically do everything on the game through click).Created and developed by Daedalic Entertaiment Deponia tells the story of rufus: a simple guy tired of his post-apocalyptic world (Deponia) devasted by the polution, on which he lives. He tries hard to leave his city (Kuvaq) and reach Elysium, a whole city floating in the sky , free of all the sadness Rufus lives on Deponia. Your journey on this game will be to guide Rufus until Elysium (again) but this time you'll have the hability to travel through time and space O 0 O.\n\nGraphics: What to say about the graphics... Deponia Doomsday as always is beautiful, the drawings are well defined, each line and detail made with balance between animated and realistic effect, daedalic as always dazzles and shine in this aspect.\n\nSoundtrack: This is other aspect where the game shines heavly, deponia has a a GREAT soundtrack, it's engaging, exciting, original ( all at the same time). Not mentioning that each  chapter of the story is introduced by a original, catchy\nand VERY funny song, called "The huzzah's songs" (link Below with some of the songs):\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcDkBH6BYyk\n\n\nGameplay: As every point-and-click game there wasn't much to change on this aspect, although daedalic overcomed itself and made the gameplay in many parts of the game very interactive, what added a lot of action in many situations.\n\nPoint-and-click games usually are "discarded", and don't receive much attention because the public believe that the style will be boring and not so much interesting. Deponia  came to prove  that all people who used to think like that (including myself) were wrong. The game is very beautiful, the story very interesting and A LOT (REALLY) A LOT funny, I challenge you to play deponia and not laugh hard at least some times along the game.Sincerely one of the best indie/point-and-click game i ever played\n\nGraphics: 9/10\n\nSoundtrack: 10/10\n\nGameplay: 9/10\n\nGame: 9/10.\n\nDaedalic team support: 10/10.","May 3","true","2.3"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","18","19","0","1"

It is important, I think, for you to know it does not before you buy; that much is only fair.  However, as a former member of the "I hate that stupid ending!" camp, I strongly urge you to give Deponia Doomsday a play, as you will otherwise not only miss one of the best adventure games of this decade, but will forego a massive amount of story and character development that puts certain things in context -- and gives a whole new perspective on the shocking end of Rufus' saga as seen in Goodbye Deponia.\n\nDeponia Doomsday is unquestionably the best Deponia game and most likely the best point-and-click in Daedelic's estimable library.  Its puzzles are brilliant, walking the line between between transparent fairness and lunatic absurdity with unwavering perfection.  It has a more spot-on translation than any Daedelic game to date, and considering how well-done many of their games are in that regard -- particularly the other Deponias -- that says a lot.  As any veteran Elysian geneticist will assure you, it has the funniest gags in the whole series.  It has more varied environments, more lavish animations and even more minigames than any previous Deponia or Daedalic game.  I encountered no bugs, and this is surprising as even the best adventures (like all games) tend to have their share.  What is most important, it has a terrific story, one so wonderfully, maniacally convoluted that it could be mistaken for a cracked Metal Gear Solid -- and looking beyond Poki's impressive feats of Kojima-esque plot engineering, it provides something truly vital for hardcore Deponia fans:  a meatier build-up to, and greater rationale for, Rufus' ultimate decision in Goodbye Deponia.  It completely changed how I felt about the end of the previous game, and I consider that no small accomplishment.\n\nDeponia Doomsday is a stroke of genius; it's as good as the genre gets.  I know that I will never get any new Rufus adventures, but I look forward to playing back through the series someday with the renewed appreciation that this amazing installment has granted me.  Perhaps if we are lucky (and we stop bombarding Poki with our demands and thus burning him out on the whole thing), we will get to experience the world of Deponia through the eyes of some other character in the future, like Goal or maybe even Bozo.

It's a solid point and click adventure with a somewhat convoluted story, decent puzzles and interesting (if ridiculous) characters.\n\nWhat was great- Great length for a point and click\n- Puzzles zany enough for this type of game but not insanely hard\n- Beautifully drawn world\n- Mildly amusing (not laugh out loud funny)\n- Decent voice acting\n\nWhat was not so great- Some of the minigames were a bit tricky (however, you can skip them)\n- Story gets a little convoluted at times\n- Very little to interact with (usually only a couple of things per screen)\n\nIt's worth commenting on the ending as some fans of the original series clearly did not like it - however, I thought in light of the first games that it was a fitting end. It gave me the feels, anyway. The ending is certainly not rushed and is dealt with with care and attention.\nIf you have played through the original trilogy I would highly recommend picking this up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SkyeF/recommended/421050/","SkyeF","Flutter Skye","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SkyeF/","413 products in account","Deponia Doomsday is possibly the final (final) game in the Deponia game series, and with the newest game, we get the best experience as well. Because, Doomsday is probably the best part of the entire series.\nYou probably played Goodbye Deponia, and thought to yourself "Man, that ending sucked" And you're probably craving for more, and then see this game, and ask yourself "Is this worth it? Will it give a better ending than the one in 3?" Well, I can answer that easily. The ending in this game is a lot more satisfying than in Goodbye Deponia, but I won't go more into that because it's not possible to do it without spoiling it.\n\nIn Deponia Doomsday, time gets rewinded to the very beginning, even before Deponia 1 happens, by the cause of a time machine. You as well as McChronicle will have to use it to revert the timeline to be back like it was originally, so you will have to solve puzzles in various times and try to not cause paradoxes and destroy the ending which happened originally. I don't wanna say  too much about the story since it's the best experience when you destroy it for yourself, but all I will say that the whole time I played through it, I enjoyed myself, and the ending gave a lot of satisfaction.\n\nDeponia Doomsday in general, seems to have a lot bigger budget than before. There's tons of new animations, cutscenes, basically things which you rarely saw in the previous games, happen here pretty often, which makes the game a lot better, and gives it more life.\n\nAlright, let's talk about the soundtrack. The soundtrack like in the previous games, is really good. But this time there's a lot more memorable tunes, and the music in general feels a lot more lively with a bigger variety of instruments in the tracks, as well as them fitting into the current location better. They also used some tracks from the previous games, which gave a bit of nostalgia to the ones who played the previous games.\n\nDeponia Doomsday, like the previous games in the series, is a Point and Click game, in this part we will be doing various things in various timelines, sometimes even having to decide what to do in a certain amount of time, before a time loop happens (and the decisions here matter more than in The Walking Dead) The Time Loops are kind of a gimmick, like controlling the 3 Rufuses in Deponia 3, and it's frankly pretty fun. You do various things, and then are able to rewind time and hopefully see a different outcome this time. There's a pretty hard Time Loop Puzzle near the end of the game, but completing it is pretty satisfacting, and seeing that the things you did before change the outcome what is now happening, is really great.\nThere's as well occasional minigames, which are simplier than in Deponia 1-2-3, but some are still challenging, and they're fun just like the previous ones.\n\n\nSo, are you asking if you should buy Deponia Doomsday? In my opinion, it really is worth it if you liked the previous games, Doomsday improves on almost everything from the previous games, and it offered me 18 Hours of laughs and fun, without going for achievements. For me, it's a master piece of the Deponia series, and I recommend it to everyone. 10/10","April 23","true","20.9"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","14","16","3","4"

The narrator, at the very beginning of the game, clearly says "You already know is has a bad ending so suck it up princess!"  So, no, this game is not an opportunity to pretend the earlier ending never happened.\n\nBut if you want to see all the trouble that Rufus can get into with a time machine, or to see what Elyssium is actually like, or just want more Rufus and Goal, grab this one.

What makes it worst is the developers leaving not so subtle hints about accepting the orginal ending and not trying the change it.

Then suddenly there's a Deponia 4 which advertises itself as using time travel to fix the horrible ending of the third game, fantastic. Everyone on the forums was really happy about them changing that ending, so I bought the game.\n\nHowever, the game is basically a big '♥♥♥♥ you' to everyone who didn't like that first ending, and about halfway through the game you realise you've been tricked, and the game still has a horrible ending.

Although most of the "puzzles" are more of "Use this item wherever the hell you can until something happens" than actual thinking. Even when you have to think, you don't have to at all. And now there's time-related puzzles: either in the form of "mash the mouse button until stuff happens" or "do these things before time runs out or do it all over again", which combined with the trial and error aspect of the point'n'click, just makes the game unenjoyable.\n\nStorywise? Don't buy this. It doesn't add in anything to the Deponia timeline. The ending of this game completely negates and erases the entirety of itself, so it's like you spent all your time for nothing. It's advertised as a chance to change the past, present and future. But ultimately, nothing at all is changed. And it just overuses the concept of time traveling, undoing things you've done and completely ignoring what it told you before, contradicting itself at every single corner.\n\nFunny bits? Okay, they're kind of there. But the previous games were funnier, this one is more of a "ha-ha I see what you did there" kind of laugh than anything.\n\nI really liked the Deponia trilogy. But it should've ended at that, just a trilogy. When I found out about Doomsday, I was completely hyped. And up until the point where you discover what the Pink Elephant really is (which is near the ending of the game), I still had hope for it. But it died soon after.\n\nHope. The only "true" aspect about this game, the thing that is discussed all over it. But sometimes, like this time, there is no hope. Only disappointment.\n\nThe only reason I'm not asking for a refund is that, gameplay-wise, I enjoyed it (even though I had enjoyed cheaper and smaller games more than this before), and that I liked the original Deponia series. Other than that, I really see no point in owning this game.\n\nUltimately, Deponia Doomsday is just a disappointment. Buy the original trilogy instead, or save your money to buy something else.

Then this game here was announced and well.. Its an insult. Yes, we knew that Poki didnt want to change the ending. He could've just stayed there. Instead, he makes another game just to rub it in. This game is a strange timey-wimey-benny-hill-plot which in the end didnt achieve anything. Rufus still dies, Elysium still can neither launch nor land and Deponia will be destroyed after all. Of course, you COULD interpret the game being about fate and blargh, but seriously, what annoys me the most is how they want you to hype their game. They bait those who are disappointed with the ending of the triology with sentences like "Can you change Deponia's fate?" No, you ♥♥♥♥ing cant.\n\nAside from that it's a solid Deponia. If you can ignore the story as a whole (sadly, I can't) it's still a fun game to play, the jokes are still good (besides some really racist and sexist ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, but yea, it's still a Deponia..) and it IS enjoyable.

Rufus is the same lovely jerk and Goal is still her... well... clever, brave and funny yet kind of "moody" self.\n\nNow, the cons of this game:  the horrible ending that (if not even more than Goodbye Deponia) left me heartbroken , the minor bugs (though hardly noticable in most cases and the lack of songs compared to the previous games.\n\nI loved Deponia Doomsday's gameplay, believe me, but... to me it felt like this game was just an excuse for Daedalic to earn more money. Sure, most of us players begged for a new game to join the series but this?  I feel totally ripped off, honestly. I feel as if Daedalic just gave me the finger and tricked me into believing that this game somehow would be different, that this wouldn't end the same way as Goodbye Deponia did. In the intro we are told that this is indeed a tragedy and no matter what the ending can not be changed but.... I'm sure most people hoped for something more.\n\nI enjoyed the game while it lasted and I have enjoyed the complete Deponia series but because of how it all turned out I will not be recomending this game. If you're looking for something better than Goodbye Deponia this is not the game for you. In the end it left me as heartbroken as I was after its predecessor and somehow I wished i hadn't spent all that time on the game. If you don't mind the ending it's an absolutely amazing game but if you're looking for something new... for something to change the fate of Rufus... well you're in the wrong place  Not only did Rufus die but also two years after his death Elysium comes crashing down in a sea of flames. His sacrifice was in the end all for nothing and that's what disappointed me the most about the game.\n\nIf you're looking for a change this is not the game for you. I'd recommend buying it on sale for 10$ but anything except that? No. The end isn't worth it.\nThough if you are looking for something else and knowing it's a tragedy - I say go for it. I was disappointed but nonetheless it was a great game while it lasted. Daedalic know how to make these types of games - even though a lot of them end in tragedy.","March 10","false","9.1"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

I have to encourage you to not buy this game. Aside from the game as a whole feeling rushed and lackluster, with bland writing and mind numbingly easy puzzles. The game as a whole feels like the developers got this game out as quickly as they could to get more money off of this popular franchise, and wrote it with pretentious writing that constantly makes jabs at fans who wanted to see more of Deponia.\nConstant comments that border on: "How dare you want more of these great games to play in? We'll show you, we'll make another game that makes you feel bad that you're playing it."\n\nIts hard to explain, but the characters constantly break the fourth wall mentioning how great the other games were, and how you, the player, is a terrible person for playing this one. It made me feel guilty for buying, and playing this game. But I kept playing, just to see if there was some light at the end of the tunnel, but there wasn't one. I won't spoil it, but the word "disappointing" does not begin to describe it.\nI had a pit in my stomach of complete and utter disatisfaction after completing this game. I'm not sure if the developers had some personal problems to vent, or if they just believe there is no hope in this world in general, but that's how it felt like they feel when playing through this game.\n\nAll in all, if you're a fan of the Deponia series, or a fan of puzzle games in general, I would recommend you stick to the first three games in the series, and stay away from Deponia Doomsday. As for me, I can't even bring myself to look at the original three games, let alone play them again, this game has so soured my view of the original.\nIt does not continue the story, it doesn't change anything. It really has no reason to exsist at all. And in these games so well driven by their stories of failure and redemption, to have nothing at all be different or interesting just has the game as a whole fall flat.\nSo I cannot on good conscience recommend this game that I so looked forward to, and was excited for.\nIf you're looking for a continuation of the Deponia story, or a good puzzle game, I'm sorry to say. There's none of that here.","March 7","false","10.1"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","11","21","0","0"

I'll leave my original first impression at the bottom.\n\nNaturally, the game's art and voice acting are still of the same high level they were before. The humour feels like it got slightly tamer, but I actually think that's a good thing because the previous games veered into "dude, not funny" territory a few times (especially the third one). In sheer playing time, this game also took me the longest of them all. I think this might be because the puzzles are just a bit more obvious this time, which means I never got stuck for so long that I opened a guide but rather spent more time thinking about puzzles myself. (To be fair, after 3 games you have a very good idea of the kinds of solutions Deponia typically requires, so that might also be why the puzzles are more obvious.)\n\nWhat I didn't like so much are the timed parts, because if you fail them you have to time loop and waste a lot of time and effort retracing your steps. The game's final section is especially guilty of this, and by far the most frustrating part of the game because of that.\n\nSpeaking of the final section, it's also where I started to lose track of the story. It becomes a big complicated mess of timelines and copies of characters. I guess the idea is to show what happens when you unleash Rufus' chaos onto time travel but it did make it a bit hard to figure out what was happening.\n\nOverall, I don't think this game is as good as the rest of the series. I understand the point the devs tried to make with this fourth game, and I enjoyed the additional characters, character development, story, context and insight in Elysium, but I feel it misses the direction and urgency that the original trilogy had. It's an "extra" game that's not really part of the main storyline of the original series, and feels more like a bunch of ideas the devs couldn't put in the other games that were linked together with timetravel.\n\nIn conclusion: I recommend it, but only if you enjoyed the first three games and realize that what you're about to play is basically just extra stuff and more Rufus-ing around.\n\n\n\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW BASED ON FIRST IMPRESSIONS:\n\n\nPlease note that this review is based just on my first impressions of the game. I'll probably update it once I finish playing, but for now I wanted to share my thoughts with people who are also fans of the series and don't really know what to expect.\n\nThose first impressions are very positive. The game's humour, puzzles, art and voice acting all remain of the same high level as before, although the fourth wall has rusted all the way down this time. Storywise, the game takes a very interesting turn. The narration itself opens by more or less saying "oh? you didn't like the ending to the third game? you want a different ending? well be careful what you wish for", which gives me confidence that, rather than a quick attempt to 'fix' the ending that so many people didn't like, this will be more like a deconstruction of that idea.\n\nMy recommendation right now? If you're a fan of Deponia, get it. If you've never played a Deponia game before, go play the first one, because obviously this one contains HUGE spoilers, right in the opening animation. If you're still in doubt, wait a few days for the full reviews to drop in. But I expect them to be positive as well.","March 1","true","16.1"," 18 of 35 people (51%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","51","18","35","2","0"

Additionally, I think that, compared to the other parts, the puzzles and combinations were a bit easier (or the experience I made with the other parts has finally paid off ;) ) The storyline itself was far more complicated than in previous games, but I think they managed to turn everything right eventually.\n\nWhen finishing the game for the first time, I didn't even manage to get half of the achievements, so I'll probably have to start it again and try to get those as well :)\n\nI played the game in German, so I don't know how well the translation was done, but other reviews mentioned that it was well done.\n\nAll in all, I have to recomend this game to anyone that enjoyed the previous parts.","March 4","true","10.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

(TldR at the end)\n\nSo here we are, exactly the same place we stopt the game 3 years ago. What's to say about Deponia 4 aside from what we all thought when the announcement came a few days ago: It shouldn't exist.\n\nDon't get me wrong, gameplaywise it is quite good compared to what the rest of the gerner has to offer, even if it is in my eyes the weakest part of the Deponia series. We have complex but almost always fair puzzles (aside from a certain star related puzzle which took me far too long) which are fun to solve, even a few timetravel puzzles which are well made and work really good. The voice acting at least in the german version was as good as in the other ones and as always the humor is awesome.\n\nThe problems start with the amount of places we go. With the exception of Kuvaq it felt rushed. You come to a places, get 5 Puzzles and head to the next one where you got 3 Puzzles and so on. The games uses different versions of the same places a few times, but no where as well as Day of the Tentacle did back in the day. Instead we visit a ton of different places which makes kinda sence for the story but wasn't really fun. In most places you got 10 interaction points or less which makes the game almost to easy (took me about 10 hours to finish it, which is the shortest Deponia for me). The Puzzles even almost disapear near the end of the game and i felt a little like playing a telltale adventure where there is a lot of story to be told but little gameplay around it.\n\nStill, Deponia 4 together with the other Daedalic adventures are the best the genre has to offer since the Lucas Arts era in the 90s. That's why i gave a thumbs up!\n\nBut as a fan of the series i have to get back to what i said in the beginning, the game shouldn't exist. I'm quite sure the intent of making the fourth part in the first place was to show that. There was a lot of feedback after Deponia 3's end because it wasn't the happy end most of us wanted. I'm not very happy that Rufus died in the end either but it works with the story and kinda had to happen to make the rest as great as it was. It was a great Ending!\nAnd to prove that it should not be changed, part 4 was made. The game even tells us that to the face...it is the moral of the story told to us by Goal.\n\nSo why shouldn't they have made it? Because all it did to me was to show me what i allready knew about the original ending (which now is still the ending i guess) by telling a story about crushed hopes which quite honestly makes me pretty sad. The game gets your hopes up, just to spit on them with the fact, that even in an endless number of itterations, there can never be a happy ending (and i really like happy endings! 8[). Would there be no part 4, the story would still be the same but with less tragedy. I'm struggeling to find the right words here so i hope some of you get my point after finishing the game (which you should do if you are a fan of the series, especially if you didn't like the ending!).\n\n\nSo summed up: Definitely buy the game if you like Deponia because of it's humor and funky characters, especially if can't accept the End of Goodbye Deponia. But there might be some feels!","March 4","true","9.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

There was a pack of their games on sale and I got it.\n\nI have since bought nearly all of their games. It's a serious problem, but whatever.\n\nThe point is that Deponia is among their best. It takes the best features of the Point and Click Genre, the wacky humor, the wild long convoluted ideas that just make sense, and it exemplefies them, but in a unique, humorous, fantastic way.\n\nNow, I played through the first trilogy, and I took great glee in them. They, among Daedalic's other titles, have revived my belief that Video Games can be as strong a narrative form as any.\n\nIf you love Deponia, or Daedalic, the opening sequence makes this game worth it. If it were not for finals, I would be playing it more. After finals, there is a high chance I will write a literary paper on this series, because I honestly feel like there is enough there to do that.

Time travelling stories always have the tendency to get very messy and Deponia Doomsday is no exception, but the game manages to keep it together.\nOnly a few characters from the trilogy occur, but that is okay. On a downside though, Deponia Doomsday cuts the traditional chapter transition songs.\n\nGameplay is the usual classic PnC adventuring (including one extra-nasty puzzle) with the occasional skippable minigame. Two things are new: they added countdowns to certain situations, which is actually fine, and they added QTEs where you have to click as fast as possible, which is a bit annoying.\n\nIn summary, Deponia Doomsday is a pretty good adventure game. As a worthy addition to the original Deponia trilogy it should definitely be played by all its fans.","March 3","true","10.6"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

I couldn't be happier to see the characters back in action!\n\n// (SPOILERS ahead)\nIf you've played the previous games in the franchise  you'll know that Goodbye Deponia ended with some pretty significant character development on Rufus' part. It seems like the guys at Daedalic really know what they're doing, because, by starting the game chronologically before any of the other installments, it meant we could keep Rufus as the loathesome jerk we love to hate. As always, Rufus  has more potential for chaos with each game to date, and with Deponia Doomsday centering around time travel, I can't wait to see how far Rufus ♥♥♥♥s things up. I love the concept of timetravel, and just how much potential it has for situation comedy... I just hope this doesn't retcon the previous game's plots out of existance.\n// (End of Spoilers.)\n\nI've only played a couple of hours so far, but from what I've seen, Deponia Doomsday works well as both a good start for new players, and a fair continuation to old players. It's already making plenty of references to the previous games, but so far it's not been in a way that alianates new players (well done!).\nI've played the three previous games, and in my opinion this one is the most gorgous to look at (both in animation quality, and overall design). The backgrounds are beautiful. The music is charming.\nAnd I still can't believe the whole thing is animated in Photoshop!\nIt has a fast start to the plot, and an instant hook, leaving the player with plenty of mystery to start pondering from the get-go. I really look forward to seeing the plot fully unfold, and seeing how it all ties in to the old games.","March 5","true","7.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I saw an announcement trailer the day before it launched and jumped a little out of surprise. I never expected a fourth game out of the series, based on the ending of the third game. I don't want to spoil anything about the fourth game's ending, because if I said anything about how it made me feel, exactly, it would be giving away too much. I will only say I didn't like it, but it did not leave me feeling gut-punched like the third did. The fourth's was very unsatisfying and a bit confusing.\n\nThis is a series that will melt your brain if you start anywhere but the beginning. Someone could try to make due, but you're so much better off starting from the beginning. It goes Deponia, Chaos on Deponia, Goodbye Deponia, and Deponia Doomsday.\n\nThe game's story, aside from the ending is surprisingly quite complicated. It revolves around time travel, multiple time loops, multiple versions of different characters, interim time, determinant time travel in addition to whatever the other part of time travel is, time portals, time machines, and- and...yeah, so picture a very complicated Doctor Who plot, but make it at least 5 to 10 times more complicated than it is, sprinkle in some Deponia comedy, and you've got this game's storyline. Even if you can "kinda" follow it, the story was more interesting than any of the first three games for me. I'm not sure how I found it to have the best story when it made the least sense, but whatever.\n\nThe humor in this game is spot on. It feels like the humor of the first three games, and there are even a few meta jokes referencing that there were three games before this one and that people didn't like the ending of the third. It's mostly analogies and cheeky ways of saying it. They don't just say "Goodbye Deponia's ending sucked" or anything -that- blatant, thankfully.\n\nThis game's puzzles were the least annoying out of the entire series. This game, along with Chaos on Deponia, had puzzles that I rarely had to go to a walkthrough for. A couple of them were just absurd and cruel, in my opinion, but a large number of them could be figured out using dialog cues, common sense, and a tiny bit of trial and error.\n\nIn short, this game has some of the series' best puzzles, some great jokes, a very complex, albeit occasionally confusing story, and an ending that is disappointing but probably won't upset you as badly as the third game's ending. If you only want to play this because you want a different ending than Goodbye Deponia, I would say that's not a good reason to buy thsi game.

I saw an announcement trailer the day before it launched and jumped a little out of surprise. I never expected a fourth game out of the series, based on the ending of the third game. I don't want to spoil anything about the fourth game's ending, because if I said anything about how it made me feel, exactly, it would be giving away too much. I will only say I didn't like it, but it did not leave me feeling gut-punched like the third did. The fourth's was very unsatisfying and a bit confusing.\n\nThis is a series that will melt your brain if you start anywhere but the beginning. Someone could try to make due, but you're so much better off starting from the beginning. It goes Deponia, Chaos on Deponia, Goodbye Deponia, and Deponia Doomsday.\n\nThe game's story, aside from the ending is surprisingly quite complicated. It revolves around time travel, multiple time loops, multiple versions of different characters, interim time, determinant time travel in addition to whatever the other part of time travel is, time portals, time machines, and- and...yeah, so picture a very complicated Doctor Who plot, but make it at least 5 to 10 times more complicated than it is, sprinkle in some Deponia comedy, and you've got this game's storyline. Even if you can "kinda" follow it, the story was more interesting than any of the first three games for me. I'm not sure how I found it to have the best story when it made the least sense, but whatever.\n\nThe humor in this game is spot on. It feels like the humor of the first three games, and there are even a few meta jokes referencing that there were three games before this one and that people didn't like the ending of the third. It's mostly analogies and cheeky ways of saying it. They don't just say "Goodbye Deponia's ending sucked" or anything -that- blatant, thankfully.\n\nThis game's puzzles were the least annoying out of the entire series. This game, along with Chaos on Deponia, had puzzles that I rarely had to go to a walkthrough for. A couple of them were just absurd and cruel, in my opinion, but a large number of them could be figured out using dialog cues, common sense, and a tiny bit of trial and error.\n\nIn short, this game has some of the series' best puzzles, some great jokes, a very complex, albeit occasionally confusing story, and an ending that is disappointing but probably won't upset you as badly as the third game's ending. If you only want to play this because you want a different ending than Goodbye Deponia, I would say that's not a good reason to buy thsi game. Thanks for reading.","March 6","true","26.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The Deponia trilogy is Daedelic's tribute to series like Monkey Island, with the the Dark Eye trilogy more a tribute to titles such as King's Quest and Legends of Kyrandia.\n\nYou'd really have to play the first three Deponia games to appreciate this one. This isn't really a standalone adventure. The crucial context here is that the final game in the (intended) Deponia trilogy disappointed some fans of the series and so they've made a fourth game to both satisfy and respond to those critics. They've done that incredibly well here.\n\nPositives: High production values, as expected in this series - above average voice acting, lots of beautiful, lush sets\nHumour is still very much intact, though I would say this wasn't the funniest of the series. That should matter little - the plot here drives the game forward, it's a slightly more serious take on the series but there was enough of the clever and topical humour (and social commentary) we expect from Deponia to keep things light\nStory is a good one and isn't overly focused on "discussing" the ending of Deponia - it's more a commentary on the fatalism of games and the value of seeking the ever-more impossible (see Hearts of Gold DLC for Witcher 3 for another take on this)\nThe puzzles are sensible (though "sensible" depends on how used to these types of games you are and the Deponia series in particular). I struggled with the cartridge puzzle but otherwise some of them were absolutely delightful when I realised the solution to them. There's a great amount of satisfaction in figuring out many of the puzzles. The second time you go back to the fun fair was great, especially how the "bowling ball" fits into everything and enables you to get the ring you need for Rokko's wedding\nIt's a long adventure game (at least 9h for a good P&C adventure gamer, and probably about 12h on average) so there's plenty of value here.\n\n\nNegatives: Inconsistency in "guidance" for puzzles. Some of them will have characters state things like "Do X but don't do ANYTHING like Y" and given how specific Y is, you know that that's what you're looking for in the game world. On the other hand, some puzzles give you so little guidance that it feels like it wasn't sensible, even if it actually was (the cartridge puzzle comes to mind) - this was rare, thankfully\nSome of the minigames were quite poorly constructed - fairly random clicking would give you the right answer (The lock puzzle on Elysium for example) but also the fun zone "games" and the portal opening minigame when being chased by the Utopians)\nPlot-related but the Utopians are a bit Deux ex Machina in this game and while they're great characters, it does feel a bit shoehorned to keep all the other time-travel logic from breaking down. I think it's a weak negative though as this game isn't about the time-travelling science itself\n\nOther thoughts:\nIt's a bit hard to follow the story if you're playing too casually (or rushing through dialogue) - there's a lot of time-travelling "logic" and some references to events in previous games to wrap your head around. The time travel logic might not be the most watertight but it holds up well by P&C Adventure Game science "standards." But as with most Daedelic games - you really shouldn't be rushing through it or skipping dialogue... Adventure games aren't for speed runs\nNo replayability in the near-term obviously, but it's always good to revisit an old beloved P&C series in a few years ;)\nNot enough Huzzahs in this game\n\n\nIf you're a fan of the Deponia series, you're probably reading this after having already bought (and maybe finished) the game. If you're a fan of P&C or Daedelic, I strongly recommend this game assuming you've already played the original trilogy. If you like irreverent or topical humour, larger than life characters and the old days of adventure gaming, then I would recommend you invest in this entire series. It's totally worth it.","March 3","true","10.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

The art is beautiful and I enjoy the humor, but the game simply fails at very basic levels of story telling and adventure game design unlike the previous games.\n\nIn the previous three games, I felt part of the world and was interested to see what's on the other side of the junkpile. In Deponia Doomsday, time traveling completely ruins any sense of progression. You're randomly thrown into places to see what unfolds in that timeline, but none of this feels important at all. Right when you get to the climax of that scene, you just go through another portal to another random place. I no longer see interesting locations and characters, I'm just trying to identify the puzzle so I can move on in the game. I don't feel like I'm moving forward in the world or the story, I'm just getting random puzzles thrown at me.\n\nThis game tops the Deponia series with the most ridiculous puzzles. With point&click adventure games, I understand some puzzles will not click for all people, and there were some bad apples in the original trilogy. But this game has already outdone all those three, at least for me. At one point, the solution is to literally go against the control scheme of all four games. You can't just, without any kind of hinting, make a puzzle that wants you to do something that each Deponia game tutorializes you not to do. They've also added weird QTE-styled puzzles, which I find completely unnecessary.\n\nDeponia Doomsday is still a fine looking game, but it fails to continue the Deponia series. I find it worse than any of the previous three in pretty much every way. As many other fans, I was upset with the ending of the trilogy, but I don't know if this game helped in any way. In fact, it might have made things even worse.","March 30","false","9.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The main idea of this one is "You want better ending? Well, suck it up, princess!".

The most awesome character to me is and will always be the epic singing storyteller. But he only makes one brief and very short appearance at the start and that is it!

I was completely thrilled when I saw this, although I was well-aware that my thrill might make me expect too much of the game. Sad to say, that's what happened - I was mildly dissapointed in this game (no sarcasm, btw, It wasn't too dissapointing), especially because I feel it had a bit of a different feel to it from the other Deponia games.\n\nThe other games often had comedy first, story second, yea? Well, in this case, it felt like it was the other way around. While that doesn't make this bad, it does mean that my expectation as a fan of this series was a bit misplaced. I expected to laugh a LOT. I expected to story to be mostly nonsense. Instead, I got only a few laughs, and a story of some depth. (It's not the deepest thing out there, but it had some depth to it)\n\nPro:\nMost of the puzzles are sound and entertaining\nYou do get >some< funny moments out of this game\nThe game is long for a point-and-click game, and rarely lets up and becomes boring.\nThe game is a meta slap-to-the-face of the fans, and I love it! If you're a fan and starts playing this game, you'll know what I'm talking about.\nMusic is solid, writing is solid most of the time.\nArt is great this time around, and it runs smoothly.\n\nCons:\nOne or two puzzles made no sense to me at all. I was stuck for hours.\nThe game is generally not as fun as I'd liked.\nThe time-travelling puzzle mechanic is incredibly annoying. ESPECIALLY when you find out it usually doesn't actually progress the puzzle.\nThe ending of this game came somewhat suddenly. Not only that, but they made your efforts in the game seem somewhat... Meaningless. "So if that other guy is solving all my problems, why am I even here?"\n\nAll in all, I'd say the game is decent, though I definitely preferred the original trilogy. If you've played that and miss Rufus, then go ahead, this game will be for you!

I was in fact happy to see a sequel come out since I was hugely disappointed in the previous ending which seemed hurried and out of character. So I was lured in to buy Doomsday with the promise of time travel and the possibility of being able to change things, only to be even more disappointed this time. This time around the ending managed to be even worse since the timeline was revealed two years further than last time, only to show us fans that none of it mattered anyway. The worst part I think is that the game let me hold on to hope until the end. As I finished I was pretty angry and felt as if I'd been not only scammed but also insulted as a fan. Nothing new here.

Items are placed not because it would be natural for this item to be in that location but only to allow to have a presumably funny puzzle. The problem is that this leads to many puzzles where you have simply no idea why you are doing things until you find the starting point and things make sense. Also there are many situations where you cannot continue with a puzzle because something is missing although it is already clear what needs to be done. This also leads to situations where other items would totally work to solve a puzzle but instead you are expected to do something weird instead.\n\nMy biggest concern is also the whole time travelling plot. There are some neat situations with this so I do not want to be completely negative about this. But most of the time the whole time aspect is used in a very confusing way, for example when two solutions are obvious but you do not know which one belongs to the current time line and which you are expected to do. Also time travelling is not used for clever gameplay as it was in Day of the Tentacle but instead to construct a very confusing story which gets more confusing as you progress.\n\nTowards the end I actually got really annoyed by it because the game fails to establish a clear story path that you are following and when you get used to one location you are sent to the next one. It is hard to really get into the game and you feel like being rushed through as much content as possible. A more laid back and focus progression would have been much better.\n\n\nMany thanks to Daedalic for this game, it has many great moments but overall it is trying to hard.\n\n“Lassen Sie mich durch!

You don't need to share it, but maybe you can agree on some points, ;)\n\n(Major Spoiler)\n\nIf you want enjoy the world of Deponia again, then this game will take you for a joy ride.\n\n\nIf you are looking for a better ending than Deponia 3 don't even bother playing. I was so happy when they announced a new Deponia game, expecting finally a good and hopefully better ending to the series. Having finished it now I a even more furious and deeply disappointed. I get that not everything and everybody get their happy ending. I get that Rufus himself develops over the course of the games. I get the author has the right to tell his story the way he wants and this is his art. But is it that wrong to grant the players and fans an ending that they want for the characters in the game? To finally end the game with a feeling of satisfaction and only mourning that the game itself ended, and not the very way the story ended?\nDeadalic games don't seem to make the type of games that I fully can enjoy thoroughly, an ending like this just is emotinally so unsatisfying and too much to handle at the same time. After having spend so much time in the world of the game in all 4 parts of the series, I want them to finally have their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ happy ending and not play a whole game for the sole purpose of letting Rufus fkn die AGAIN.\nDon't get me wrong, it's the Deponia I love, the characters, the voices, the humor... In all these aspects the game is just wonderful.

If you played through original trilogy you will feel like creators are making fun of you for buying their game, as if they DON'T want you to play it ! I felt unwelcomed by just playing this game.\nIt has a lot of animal cruelty (which was more of a joking/offscreen thing in previous parts) and jokes in general are not too good.\nPlot isn't great either, it doesn't continue Rufus' story or make it more interesting, if anything it makes it less enjoyable and since finishing this game I will cringe whenever I hear "Deponia".","May 3","false","7.8"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","36","5","14","2","0"

The journey was well written and the game mechanics were fantastic. The ending of the third game definitely was recieved poorly by fans and for good reason. We went on a journey of redemption with a loveable character only to have him recieve a depressing end. The fourth installation felt as if the creators were passive-agressively - though the game, rubbing salt in the wound of players as if saying "this is the ending. we're not changing anything to please you". So now I'm not sure if I would buy any more spin offs or games concerning deponia due to this. Which is a shame because I think they could make a lot of money continuing this franchise and actually LISTENING to its fans. Give the fans what they want, and you will benefit as well.\n\nDeponia doomsday was a good game with new time mechanics that made the game different and fun. The characters we love are still there, with new ones as well. The voice acting as per usual is on par. More mini games and puzzles added a nostalgic feeling. Music was reminiscent. But still, I felt the creators building up the suspense of the fans just to crush everyone's hope that the fourth game might actually appeal to us. After all, wasn't the catalyst of this game due to an upset of FANS who wanted a happy conclusion? It is kind of a slap in the face to fans who dreamt that a sequel or spin off would come and give us a conclusion we could actually accept and be happy with.\n\nUnless you're alright with a disappointing ending just as the last game, then I definitely recommend it. However, if you prefer not to be let down for the second time, then maybe ignorance is bliss and then I'd say don't buy it.","March 20","false","8.6"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

I played the whole trilogy and loved it. The ending was not what I expected or hoped for, yet I did not complain for it was very strong. I thought that was it. The journey was over, Rufus and Goal would've lived on in my gamer memories.\n\nAnd yet, I always wished things went down differently. A chance to go back, to do something different, to challange fate and see Rufus on Elysium. This game gave this to me.\n\nThis game is NOT fanservice, this game is all about avoiding the unavoidable and fighting battles that can't be one. Yet it gives you hope. So if you fear this game breaks the other three, fear no longer.\n\nStory and comedy wise this might be my favorite chapter. I actually try to avoid the solutions of the riddles. Every fail is rewarded with a new joke. It is at least on par with Chaos and Goodbye.\n\nLast word of advice. If you don't mind subtitles, or if you actually know the language (gut fur dich Kumpel) PLAY THE GAME IN GERMAN. Rufus's voice actor is just hilarius.\n\nDieses Spiel hat mir Deutsch gelehrt :).","March 3","true","18.9"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

Please understand that this review includes specific examples of events in-game that could be considered spoilers.\n\nPositives: Lovely hand-drawn art style. Competent voice acting. Highly detailed environments. Revisted old locations and characters in a fresh, new way.\n\nNegatives: Daedalic offers us unimaginative mini-games (click on the psychadelic red mushroom to make your Mario-Kart, er, go-kart, go faster), QTE events, shoehorned pop culture references (see the aforementioned Mario Kart), and "read my mind" item associations that become harder and harder to parse out the more frustrated the player gets.\n\nAlso on the plate: shockingly off-the-cuff racism (Rufus comments "There goes the neighborhood" upon viewing a mixed race couple moving into an apartment), transphobia (telling a trans woman her bust is too small, her legs are too hairy, and her voice is too manly, immediately after said woman was assaulted, e.g., his beard ripped off and his genitalia presumably as well, by Rufus' on-again/off-again girlfriend Toni), and completely unintelligable logic (too many examples to even consider narrowing it down) makes DEPONIA DOOMSDAY an unimaginably low-brow, immature venture. As if giving their playerbase two giant middle fingers,\n\nThe logic is, well, Deponian. As with the earlier installments, there are some leaps of logic you just have to feel froggy enough to get (bra underwire plus halved potatoes equals ear protectors? Okiedokie.). Most chapters will end up being a daisy chain of "do this, then this, then this, then that, and now this" consisting of ~20 steps, a gameplay style that has never been very rewarding. "You want over twenty hours of gameplay out of a point-and-click adventure, dammit, you're going to get it!" Having multiple action chains going at once would allow a player to switch it up if they get stuck, but DOOMSDAY offers one row to hoe, and God be with you if you get confused or lost, which may happen often. The logic shifts and changes, and players are expected to fumble around until they act against the pre-determined rules as well (even though there's no Interact icon, left-click anyway until something happens).\n\nArt assets are clearly reused from earlier games, and no more obvious than right at the beginning. Animations of new assets are smoother, while old assets are janky and stuttery. Entire scenes feel like they're missing, and the cinematics will simply jump ahead to avoid them, giving some transitions a terrible whiplash. Only once do we get the guitar player strumming us into a new chapter (even then, it's a disappointing, in-your-face "shame on you for not liking the ending" finger-wagging) and no tongue-in-cheek tutorial that we've come to know and love from the earlier installments.\n\nThe ending is frustratingly convoluted, with the exposition dump insisting that the solution was there the whole time and this loop was really connected to this loop and we didn't realize that there were two major loops with smaller loops inside the loops and, and, and...okay, Rufus. As Goal and the guitar-player insist, we shouldn't "taunt endings." I've learned my lesson.\n\nOverall: It was a mediocre slog through a frustrating swamp of barbed wire. DEPONIA DOOMSDAY felt less like a new chapter in an oddball, quirky series and more like two big middle fingers for people who dared be unhappy or unfufilled with the ending to the Trilogy.","March 3","false","17.1"," 17 of 40 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","17","40","0","1"

After the ending of the third game I was pretty sure that was all there was going to be of the franchise. Anyway this isn't going to be a super indepth review, i'm just gonna state my feelings on this game and how it impacts the previous 3.\n\nTo start off, this is a good game. It's funny and strange like the other three. Its feels like the devs never even lost touch with how this series is supposed to be presented like or how to write for it.\n\nThats pretty much it for the review portion of this.\n\n\nNow for how I feel about this game and its inclusion into the series.\n\nWarning heavy spoilers below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt doesn't need to exist. There never needed to be a fourth game. You just end up ending the story the same way again as the third game did. This game was pretty much just the writers way of addressing the complaints of the players on the ending of the third game, which to be honest I really liked it. I was happy with how the series ended with Rufus sacrificing himself in order to ensure everyone on deponia and elysium were able to live together in relative peace. I know of course the writer could have made the story to where Rufus never had to sacrifice himself but they didn't. I know the appeal of wanting a happy ending too, I mean anyone who is interested in buying this game would have played the previous ones. I really wanted Rufus and Goal to have a happy ending where they are able to be together and be happy, but I know that not every story has to have a happy ending.\n\nWhile I really enjoyed this game and I do not regret buying it I don't think I could recommend it to fans of the original trilogy.","March 2","false","14.4"," 36 of 134 people (27%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","27","36","134","6","5"

This one has a pretty rough start. The first few hours really stretch out with obscure puzzles and frustrating time loops that just result in you completing the same rooms over and over. There are some hilarious scenes, in particular the wonderfully silly (German) grammar argument with an elephant, but it's only about halfway through where the puzzles become intuitive and enjoyable to solve, and the plot starts to go to the screwball place time travel comedies should go. Rufus remains a total asshat, but he grows up in the final scene and the door is left open for a spin-off with a potentially much less awful protagonist. If you liked the first ones, you'll like this one, just persevere through the first half.\n\nWie schön es war wieder nen neues Deponia zu bekommen! Pass auf, das Anfangs dieser Geschichte ist extrem langweilig und es dauert ne Weile bis es echt Spaß macht. Es gibt ein Paar großartige Wortspiele, aber die Opening-Rätseln sind unklar und wiederholend. Glücklicherweise die zweite Hälfte des Spiels ist viel besser. Nur dann fängt es richtig an mit der bizarren Umstände und lustige Komödie die ich aus sone Zeitreise Geschichte wirklich erwartete. Auch die Rätseln werden logischer, und die Charaktere interessanter. Leider bleibt Rufus wie immer ein ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, aber endlich in die letzte Scene wachst er etwas.

They’re single-handedly showing that Point and Click Adventures are still a viable source for thoughtful and engaging entertainment. While Deponia Doomsday isn’t my favorite of the series, it's still worth journeying through once again. The story isn’t as focused as it could’ve been and spends most of its time justifying the trilogy’s ending in some moments that feel more like lecturing than fun. While I agree with the message that the franchise needs a change in order to feel fresh, this entry ends up proving its own point by delivering a product that feels a tad stale. Despite this, Doomsday has only increased my hopes that we get a new trilogy, and if this is the beginning of a new era, I look forward to what the team has in store for the future.","March 8","true","18.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I can not make any statements regarding the english voice actors or the translation.\n\nQuick Review\n\nDeponia Doomsday is the fourth installment of Daedelics point-and-click adventure series. It features around 6-10 hours of gameplay and the same high quality art and voice actors (at least the german ones), alongsite the fantastic and wonderous world that is Deponia (if you like tabletop games, check out the Deponia: Roleplaying Game (based on the Fate Trash ruleset)). The puzzles are  mostly logical, that is, point-and-click-adventure-logical. And that is deliberatly so. They are build in a way where you have to ask yourself: "Okay, obviously, this isnt going to be the direct solution. But what kind of methaphors or puns could I use to achive the desired outcome?". If you are looking for logical puzzles, you won't find them here. But then again, if you are playing Deponia Doomsday without having liked the first three, what are you even doing here? There are also some (less fun) mini-games. Thankfully, they are all optional.\n\nThere isn't much to say about the technical aspects of the game: It is 2D, so It runs perfectly smooth on my 6 year old notebook.\n\nOnce again, it is Deponia, nothing more, nothing less. If you liked the first three games and want to spend some more time with Rufus and friends, do check it out.\n\n\n\nIMHO\n\nIn many ways Deponia 3: Goodbye Deponia is the "real ending" of the series. If you were one of those fans who wanted a happy end, spoiler, this isn't going to be one. There can't be a happy end. Why? Because once again you are playing as Rufus. And he is still the same he was in the first game: A sociopath in the real sense of the word, an anti hero per definition with no empathy (or respect) for others. He doesn't think about the cause of his actions, just their effects. And so, yet again, he tries to achieve one simple Goal (ha!), which leads to a downward spiral of chaos. While his actions are motivated by trying to fix previous ones, they too will surely lead to.. but I think we already know that, right? It is Rufus, after all.\n\nThere are a lot of in-jokes for the fans, especially those ones who know about the reactions after the second and third part of the series. There are a lot of puns and bad jokes. There is a lot of german humor.\n\nAnd there is once again Rufus, Goal, Toni and a cast of other characters. If you didn't like the third one, don't play this one. Otherwise, sit back, enjoy the ride and after everything is over, pour yourself a cold one, toast to adventures past and let Rufus have his redemption.\n\nEven if it means to let go.\n\n\nP.S: It also has one of the funniest (interactive!) building montage scenes in any game I know :D","March 9","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The voice actors are doing a great job (I played in German!), the scenes are bursting with details and the story, yeah it is great but you have to witness it. I don't want to spoil ;)\n\nI played around 15 hours. I took my time to discover as much dialog as possible and of course I am not the best at adventues. Oh but by the way. If you are looking for a difficult game then Deponia is nothing for you but if you are looking for a good story, lovely characters and just a good time you found the right game.\n\nI recommend playing the other three Deponia Games first. You can play this game without the background since they are telling the core story of the past games but trust me.

Doch nun ist er zurück!\n\nZeitreisen für Anfänger\n\nFür alle die, den letzten Teil von Deponia nicht gespielt haben sollten, bitte überspringt diesen Absatz. Da man zum Schluss von Chaos auf Deponia quasi den Heldentod stirbt, wobei es nie klar war, ob wir wirklich sterben, kehrt mit Doomsday etwas Neues in die Serie.\nIn Deponia Doomsday können wir Zeitreisen! Ein spannendes neues Element, womit sich auch glatt ein weiteres Spiel machen lässt. Allerdings ist das nicht die einzige Neuerung, denn gleich zum Tutorial lernen wir das, sag ich mal Klick Event kennen. Dabei musst du so schnell wie möglich die linke Maustaste drücken, um z.B. ene Tür zu zuhalten.\n\n\nEine zweite Chance\n\nDer vierte Teil der Serie setzt noch vor den Ereignissen des ersten Spiels ein. Das Erste, was wir erleben ist ein Tutorial mit einem sehr alten Rufus. daraus lässt sich zumindest schließen, dass wir den Sturz im letzten Teil irgendwie überlebt haben. Nach dem Tutirial fängt alles scheinbar mit einem Traum an, aber wer die vorherigen Spiele kennt, weiß dass es die Handlung war, die wir bis dahin kannten. Doch nun wachen wir in einer kleinen Kabine auf und wundern uns über diesen Traum. Wir sind noch mit unserer Freundin Toni zusammen und basteln gerade in einem offensichtlich verstrahlten Gebiet an einem Heißluftballon. Damit wollen wir natürlich Deponia verlassen und nach Elysium fliegen.\nDa lernen wir auch schon einen neuen Charakter im Spiel kennen, McChronicle, ein Zeitreisender. Der ist bei weitem nicht der einzige, es kommen ca 70 neue Charaktere auf uns zu in ungefähr 20 Spielstunden.\nScheinbar hat er es geschafft aus einem Auto eine Zeitmaschine zu bauen. Und prompt ist Rufus in die ganze Zeitreise Sache hinein gezogen. Wie wir alle wissen läuft das natürlich nicht ohne Unfälle ab.\n\n\nDer Tüftler ist wieder da\n\nAuch in Deponia Doomsday gibt es wieder tolle Rätsel. Manchmal zwar recht schwer zu lösen, zumindest war es das für mich und auch recht Sinnfrei zum teil, da man nie auf die Idee kommen würde z.B. eine Klobrille zum Teil einer Falle werden zu lassen.\n\nAber das macht gerade den Reiz des Spiels aus. Es gibt auch wieder eine menge Witze mit dabei und die Wahl der Synchronsprecher ist auch wieder oberste Schublade! Ich freue mich jedes mal, wenn ich das Spiel starte, dass ich wieder so tolle Stimmen hören kann. So etwas ist doch recht selten, besonders im deutschen Spielemarkt.\nDie Steuerung ist auch recht einfach, man braucht quasi nur die Maus und für Tipps gibt es noch die Leertaste. Mit der Leertaste werden alle Objekte angezeigt, die man benutzen kann.\n\n\n\nMein Fazit ist, wer noch keinen Teil von Deponia gespielt hat, sollte das schnell ändern, denn dieser Teil gefällt mir jetzt schon sehr sehr gut. Und wer die anderen Teile schon kennt, für den ist es ein Pflichtkauf! Wer will schon verpassen wie es mit Rufus weitergeht?!\n\n","March 9","true","16.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The original ending was ok, not great. This adds a lot to it, and on many levels.\n\nThis game is animated, voiced and scored extremely well, I find. There are a wide range of locations in this game, each with an organic feel and things to do that makes the environment fun to explore. This, in addition to puzzles that make sense [unlike some in the roiginal series], makes the game great to play. This game also adds a lot of new characters, as well as fleshing out old ones, which does a good job of making the universe in this game more real, and more involving.\n\nThe game itself seems pretty huge considering the large number of areas there are to explore, but without the "acts" separating things up, it may seem a bit overwhelming, so you may need to pace yourself in order to fully understand whats going on.\n\nDefinitely worth playing if you're a fan of the series, and want a proper conclusion. If you haven't played the previous ones, then there's no point in playing this one. It's not a very good jumping-on point.\n\nSpoilery bits:\n\n\nThis game manages something that is very hard to do well: Time Travel. From the various paradoxes it covers, all of the different timelines you see, and in the end the massive time loop, it shows just how dangerous time travel could be. I especially like how it shows how bleak an unending scenario would be.\n\nAfter the end of Goodbye, we are left with a lot of unanswered questions. Basically the only thing that is said outright is that Rufus dies. This is not great. It just feels like an empty not-quite-ending to the story.\n\nDoomsday does a good job in covering the bases to show why the ending was inevitable, and it helps to answer a lot of questions, giving it a clearer ending.\n\nWe learn what happens after: Elysium eventually crashes back to Deponia. In other words, it makes it explicitly clear that there is no happy ending possible. But it goes further than this: It shows that regardless of the choices that Rufus could make, things are always going to be doomed.\n\nThis all helps to clarify the previous end, and explain why it is the 'necessary' ending.","March 26","true","14.8"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

The game kind of contradicts itself a lot and I can't help but feel there's a tiny bit of spite towards the fanbase.\n\nIt would be pretty boring if every game ended the same with the same themes, but honestly I play video games to escape reality and relax not be reminded of its harsh truths.","April 22","true","11.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Game is more random, the wierd combinations of items are getting more ridiculus. Its  a "fine" chapter that ends the game.. but ...... the ending gives you a bit of salty taste. Also game doesnt throw you the main objective at the very begin of the game.. instead you just play and hope some items did something and you can use them somewhere. A Main objective here is very... blurry We had in prev. Deponia a mission to get to Elysium ... now is saving the world. Its the same Funny adventure, with good salty comments towards Rufus , and we have some old friends form prev. games, a bit of easter eggs from other Games. If i had to say how good this game is i would say 8/10.","April 25","true","10.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
