"http://steamcommunity.com/id/axellslade/recommended/458420/","axellslade","AxellSlade","http://steamcommunity.com/id/axellslade/","1298 products in account","Straight up copy n' paste of Last Heroes 2 with a pointless story.\n- Uses default RPG Maker VX assets, like Last Heroes 1 & 2\n- 2 side quests like the last game\n- You go thru the whole dungeon, walk back out to the city only to find out you have to go all the way back to the end of the dungeon to fetch an item, then come back out again... Just like the last game\n- You find two new heroes, just like the last game\n- You do a whole bunch of stuff for nothing, since the prison is not on this continent, like the last game\n- Enemies chase you off like mad rabbits, exactly like the last game\n- When you reach the end of the dungeon, there's talk then the boss comes out of nowhere, in every dungeon, like the last game\n\n- Please Raphael Delmaschio, finish this series off and move on with your life, pretty please no more games from you.","May 28","false","5.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

The problem is that no one seems to know the exact location of the prison so various clues must be gathered from various characters which leads to a long and interesting search that lends itself to more exploration, more treasure collecting, and more battling monsters.\nIt's all presented in the classic rpg style, complete with nostalgic game play, excellent art work, labyrinthine mazes to navigate, great music that adds to the atmosphere and charm, characters that are easy to like, and, most importantly, a solid story that will keep you interested and wanting to do "just one more thing" ---- very addictive.\n\nAs you progress through the game, you will pick up new weapons with the money you earn, and acqire new battle skills with a pleasing flow that suits the game ---- not a lot of grinding required. But you'll need to battle with a bit of thought ---- just adds to the fun.\n\nIf you choose, you can play this one without having played the first two ---- but I would recommend playing them in order just to get the complete story. And, at the reasonable prices, why not? But it can stand alone.\nEither way, it's a great classic style game that fans will enjoy.","April 2","true","3.4"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

This one, like the others will last 6-8 hours so you don't have to commit half a month to it. My only gripe is that every time you start a new part/game in the series the characters start right back at level 1 with no gear or money from the previous adventure and no explaination as to why. A shame really as it means there's no incentive to develop the characters any futher than needed to beat the final boss as you know it's all going to be for naught when Last Heroes 4 comes out.","May 5","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
