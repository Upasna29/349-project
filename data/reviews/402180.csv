Sakura Swim Club was released on 9/11, and such a date is no coincidence. The game itself serves as a somber reminder of the event, but most of all as a critique of the American reaction as such. The two girls, referencing the Twin Towers no doubt, also provide a deep philosophical insight into the post 9/11 governmental response, of the bickering between two political parties despite both of their intents being the good of the American people, represented by the main character. Truly a work of art and a standout for its deep thematic elements that rival that of any great work.","September 11, 2015","true","4.4"," 3,026 of 3,531 people (86%) found this review helpful 3,698 people found this review funny","86","026","3","698","77"

But I really don't like how the story ended, not that the story was bad, but the fact that, much like with the other Sakura games, the story could easily keep on going and I felt it a bit short.\n\nWhile I know that Visual novels are not for everyone, they are great when you want to take a break from intensive user input games and when you want to relax and read/enjoy a story. This is no exception. It has an good story and has left me wanting more.\n\nPros:\n- Original Artist Back.\n- Amazing Soundtrack.\n- Ecchi, But modest and doesn't take themes too far.\n- Story that if you actually read, will have you wanting more.\n\nCons:\n- Story was too short IMHO, could have extended to a FINAL choice was needed.\n\nNo Other Cons\n\nThat's about it.\nIf you like visual novels, a fan of the Sakura Series (Spirit & Angels) with the original artist making a return, You may end up liking this VN as well.\n\n\n\nUPDATE:\nI had no idea there was a patch for this game, thanks to Videogame57 for saying.\nIt basically means that my previous review is null and void. Ignore everything I said about the ecchi images, the patch takes it a lot further. When I reviewed the game it was within 4 hours of its release so I had no idea of the patch.\n\nMy point still stands for the other Pros, the fact that is has a really good soundtrack is the same ect.\nI will not post a link to the patch, but it is available for download if you look for it.","September 11, 2015","true","4.1"," 163 of 225 people (72%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","72","163","225","24","2"

Sakura Fantasy introduced more storylines (decisions) and interesting dialogue which I find a necessity in games like these.\n\nThere is so much work that could have been done. I understand that sometimes you need to release content that you know will sell quickly regardless of its faulty, its how business works. And in the end we all know what these games are: to satisfy the male population whom wholeheartedly seeks to fulfill their desires niche.\n\nUnlike some people, I'm willing to admit I like drawings of female students with melon sized chest and apple bottoms. But when it can be so much more than "wrist injuries" and "tissue management", don't you think you deserve more than this?\n\nWhat I feel this game lacks and what I think games like this deserve\nA variety of choices that effect the direction of the story (Which, in SF, was a step in the right direction)\nA better emotional attachment to the characters (Specifically referring to: "My mom has cancer". Really? Couldn't have explained it better?) - This is however, improving in the sakura series\nAnimation ( Yes, I'm specifically referring to the animations like those in NEKOPARA)\nWhat I feel like this game fulfills or exceeds at:\n18+ Content that more than half of the community desires. ( Which I think is part of games like this)\nArtistical talent\nFinally, I feel like the Sakura series could be so much more.

But I do not recommend this visual novel reason can be found below.\n\nThe storyFollow the story of Kaede, just your average high school guy. Upon transferring to a new school, he meets two beautiful girls in the swim club. Things haven't gone well for the swim club lately, but with Kaede's help, that all changes.\n\nAudio and Visual elementsVisual elements as much as I hate to say this, the art for sakura games are always very solid always nice and really smooth looking, overall pleasing to the eye\n\nAudio elements I am not really sure but I think i heard some of them before from their sakura clicker game which is being re-used (just a portion), obviously it is a huge negative for me in regards to the audio, this just shows how much effort has been put into this visual novel.\n\nReasons for not recommending this Visual NovelThe story is very generic, when I first read this visual novel I felt bored very bored because its generic and predictable. The story felt like it was being taken from somewhere and then being placed into their game and just change the location/theme that it takes place which in this case a swim club.\n\nThe fansercvice, while playing through this visual novel you are literally being slapped in the face with boob and panty shots every 15 minutes, this just shows that they are using fanservice to cover up their bad and generic story.\n\nSome scenes, I will be honest here so scenes does not make any sense despite it being very nice to look at 1 - 2 scenes just does not make any senses lets take for example, the scene where the 2 heroines were kissing each other underwater.\n\nTo sum upNo i do not recommend getting this game at all unless you are a sakura series fan or just want a story that slaps you in the face with boobs every 10 minutes in a attempt to cover up their bad plot/story.","January 15","false","29.7"," 56 of 77 people (73%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","73","56","77","10","10"

A 2 hour long trip full of fan service and harem genre cliches, but unlike Sakura Fantasy Chapter 1 this game follows the trend of the first two games (along with their marginal improvements over one another) with the story focusing on a pair of two genuinely entertaining swim club members. While the other Sakura games all have a "suddenly tragic backstory" section where an attempt at making the reader feel a connection towards a character none were handled particularly well I must admit this one actually is a pretty decent improvement over the others (not good, but an improvement) even if, ridiculously, literally every character has one.\n\nThe dialogue overall is basically on par with Sakura Spirits, but there were a lot of typos throughout the entire VN which is a pretty big issue when it's so short.\n\nIf you're looking for some entertaining and funny harem style story you're going to get one here. It's actually pretty funny breaking new records for the Sakura games in terms of the oblivious MC and his funny as hell deadpan responses the events around him. If you want rounded characters with rich backstories who you can relate and connect with then look elsewhere.\n\nIs it a good VN? No. Is it a good VN for the genre that it wants to be? Yes, and that's why I can recommend these only to those who find this style funny/entertaining.\n\nSide note: The menu sound effects are SO SATISFYING THEY ARE LIKE THE BEST PART OF THE GAME. 10/10 MENU SOUND DESIGN.","October 10, 2015","true","3.4"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","95","19","20","8","0"

Why? Well, the story is fairly mediocre and extremely linear, which is usually fine in an H game, and something I wouldn't ordinarily be so picky about. However, the game is also quite short, and I beat it and followed every possible path in about 2 hours, and not only that, but there are honestly fairly few H scenes to be found regardless. All in all, the game is likely worth your time if you're an average hentai VN reader, but at 10 dollars the price is rather steep for what I consider to be a short and frankly unpolished VN. This being said, it's great to see an American studio attempt to bring Visual Novels to an English-speaking market, and hope to see better things in the future from Denpasoft, as I have great hopes for this company.","September 14, 2015","false","2.7"," 28 of 44 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","28","44","2","0"

What are the real differences between close friends and a couple?\n\nIt was interesting to see how the writer handled 3 kind-hearted and well meaning people in the early stages of a forming "love triangle".

They passed this off as a game?  This is my first sakura game and most certainly my last, the only reason I bought it was because of the good reviews and because it was in the same category as Huniepop (which was an incredibly fun puzzle game).\n\nThis wasn't a game.  I made maybe 4 interactive choices in the game, and the rest of the OVER AN HOUR OF "GAMEPLAY" was my clicking to get through the terribly written (terribly translated?) "story".  The character you play as is generic and boring, completely void of personality, and the girls (the only 2 sprites in the entire game) are copy paste from every anime ever.  Even as a porn it sucks.  5 or so ecchi pictures throughout thousands of dialog boxes, all of which happen "accientally" because you, the main character, Keade or some ♥♥♥♥, would walk into the girls lockeroom, or into their bathroom while they're changing, then act surprised, and procede to try and skip 30 fedora-tipping dialog boxes about how pretty she is.\n\nWhat the ♥♥♥♥, this whole thing was trash.  Gameplay?  None.   Story?  Garbage.  Length?  Nonexistant.  Replayability?  I wish I didn't "play" it in the first place.  Characters?  Copypaste.  Art?  Pretty good, oddly enough.  But for $10? (~$7 on sale?)  I would expect more than two ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ avatars, and a handful of backgrounds.\n\nNot a game, don't advertise it as one.  If you want something similar that you can actually play and have an impact in, try Huniepop.

Here's another VN from your favorite developer Winged Cloud\n\nSakura Swim Club\nWhat would you do if all your life you have lived under your father shadow? what would you do if after some many schools, so many clubs and some many boring moments you finally find the one club that changes your life? Well that's the story here. You are Kaede and after a long time living under your father shadow and a somewhat boring life you find a club, a swimming club, that would change your life for ever. This background story is not bad, it's actually interesting but the way it is developed isn't.\n\nIn your new club you find only two other members, female members, and since this is another Sakura game I'm quite sure I don't have to tell you what would happen. As I said before, plot, plot all over the place.\n\nHere we go.\n\nStorySakura style, no actual background just a story about a guy meeting two girls and hooking up with them.\n\nArt StyleAgain, Sakura style which means is good, nicely drawn backgrounds and character sprites. There are some CGs that really caught ones eye.\n\nMusicSame as always, I didn't pay much attention to it.\n\nPros.\n- Art style!!\n- For those of you who like it there is a 18+ patch\n\nCons.\n- Music\n- Underdeveloped story\n\nIn overall I would say a 6/10, if you want to buy it wait for a sale, a very good sale.\n\nThe recommendation goes for there is no "Meh" button here (sorry folks).\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ElderLolz/recommended/402180/","ElderLolz","Elder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ElderLolz/","76 products in account","They didn't even try to hide the fanservice in this one.\n\nI know these games have no other purpose than getting you to jack off, but seriously. The others at least had some thought behind them. This one is literally "The quest for breasts". Sakura Swim Club is about our main character Generic McWhiteman having to find a gf. Where to look first? At his new school (what a new concept) which conveniently has a swim club where only two females with big boobs attend. We all know what's gonna happen.\n\nThe game starts with our hero being in his room (also something we've never seen in a Sakura game) talking about him being at a new school and being so edgy that he doesn't care. Even during school he doesn't care, which causes the teacher to have a talk with him. You doh't get to see her, but we all know how they would have drawn a female teacher in a Sakura game. She asks if you want to join some club to live out your interests, and the inevitable choice is the swim club, which seems to be rather imfamous. As you go there you bump into one of the girls going there and get to see her pantsu. She is sooo embarrased but ends up liking you anyway. Surprise. Anyway, you progress to the pool and see the two boobs. Girls. Sorry. You get to meet them, hang out with them, yadda yadda, it's basicly a more straight forward Go! Go! Nippon or Sakura Spirit. The game's writing is as amazing as ever and features our favourite actor Typos BadGrammarston. Also don't forget about the CG scenes. In one of them one of the girls literally tumbles over a controller cables which causes her to be unable to move and be half-naked. Yes.\n\nI can't really say there's much to expect from these games story-wise, and this one's purpose clearly isn't story. The other games had some sense of story. They were books with a certain amount of hentai stuffed in them. This one is hentai with a certain amount of novel stuffed in it. Apparently this game, along with Sakura Fantasy got censored for steam even, and we're not talking "oh no a nipple better put a conveniently placed object over it, no. That was the case in Sakura Fantasy, yes, but in this game's original cut you got to actually see some... "action" I guess. I mean that's what some of the guides suggested when I alt-tabbed.\n\nEdit: I did some uh...practical research. Never again.\n\nI recommend this game for people who have no idea where to see lewd pictures of 2D waifus. I don't recommend this game for people who are looking for a meaningful visual novel. It does serve the purpose of a novel, not a good one, but a novel. But the bigger purpose it serves is to get you hard.","October 18, 2015","false","1.3"," 16 of 28 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","16","28","3","4"

If you play these only to beat your meat then by all means go ahead and catch a glimpse of a few "revealing" pictures, don't expect too much though. There's several reasons why this fails as a good VN. The characters are shallow and provoke no feelings at all. The plot is cheesy, highly unrealistic, boring and rushed. Kaede, the protagonist, makes no connection to the player in any way. Simply throwing in some daddy issues and half ♥♥♥♥♥ soul searching does not immerse the player in the story. While the two other characters provided some hopes as plot devices they failed their role of both heroines and plot device. Feeling sympathy or empathy for the heroines is nigh impossible since their conflict is touched only slightly and immediately resolved once they're introduced. Apathy is the only thing I ever felt towards any character since their choices are ridiculously simple and have no impact on anything. There is only one route which is too perfect to be happy about. Plot itself is cheap and very dull, there is no real main conflict until half way through the game and even that is resolved just a few moments later. If you're not looking for conflict but rather romance even that concept is slaughtered by a stupid "tease never show anything and no real feelings" relationship. This is a VN without plot, depth and characters. Huge waste of money there's plenty of better VNs.","September 15, 2015","false","1.2"," 21 of 38 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","21","38","2","0"

It’s fan service, so if you’re looking for a visual novel like that, go for it. the art style is quite pretty, BG, BGM and VA were good too. But your choices really don’t affect on anything. The game gives you an “illusion” that you can control your fate, but you really can’t.\n\n4/10, since it’s just fan service and in my opinion, the weakest of the Sakura series.

Well it's definatly interesting. It's kinda short. it only took me a little over 4 hrs to finish. There are very few spots where you are asked to make a choice. Less then a dozen. And I don't think any of them change the outcome in any way. I got the "Patch" for it to see what everyone was talking about. It made it .... well it made it Adult. I don't know what else to say. The story was interesting on it's own. I am really surprised that they would touch on such serous subjects as drunk driving and cancer in something that is really suppose to be lite hearted but it gave the story a more believable real life feel to it. All in all I enjoyed while taking a break from my more serious gaming. I still don't think it's worth $9.99. So wait till it's on sale.

Even as a fan of VNs in general, I feel the Sakura games typically cater to a niche audience.  If you are part of that audience, this game is a definite improvement over the older Sakura games.  The presentation is cleaner, the dialog is less awkward, the story makes more sense, and there happens to be an 18+ patch for the game if you are over 18 and would like more explicit content.\n\nA word about the patch.  It isn't available directly on Steam and the game itself is not uncensored without the patch in order to comply with Steam's rules and make the game more accessible.  So ignore the complaints from those who say there is false advertising.  It does take a bit more work to install the patch than say the one for Sunrider did, but it's not bad and you definitely don't need to enjoy the patch.\n\nThe bottom line is, if you like the Sakura games and don't have this one, pick it up while it is on sale.  If you don't like the games, I don't think the refinement of the formula will change your mind.","December 24, 2015","true","1.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I legitamatly found enjoyment in this\n\n\nI allways said this about VN's and that is if I found myself laughing frequently I had a good experience I laughed a good few times here and there, and unlike the previous novels made by this developer the characters have actual depth this time (allbiet not very much) so it at least shows a good sign for this developer that they are working on that. Also there is a uncencored patch which adds actual lewd matierial they're small but will probably work at making someone horny whoever out there that is, Throw in some pretty decent music and you have Sakura Swim Club but what I see more out of this game is improvment in writing from the developers which is always good\nOverall\n\nStory 5/10 Nothing Groundbreaking just normal rebelious kid doesn't want to be like family stuff except with actual reasoning from the main character that feels legitamit\n\nArt 6.5/10 Nothing too different from WingedCloud here which is fine, But the background feel like they took a step up in quality\n\nSound 6.5/10 This has some pretty decent music except for one track that has a real off saxophone, and good usage of ambiant noises\n\nOverall 6/10 Its your average visual novel but with a kick ♥♥♥ rock track within it, Whats more important is that it shows improvment from the developers which is good\n\n\n\n","September 22, 2015","true","3.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hunter7520/recommended/402180/","Hunter7520","Atrocity","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hunter7520/","210 products in account","Another addition added to the Sakura franchise!\n\nFans of the other Sakura games will be happy to see the pretty character and background designs returning. The detail in the little things such as the glistening of water falling off a character getting out of the pool to various "predicaments" that the two female characters find themselves in are enjoyable to see. The music also helps accompany the relaxing tone that is set for most of the story in this VISUAL NOVEL (since many reviews seems to not be aware this game is one) while filling in fun filled tunes for the fanservice bits as well as dark undertones that are brought in.\n\nThe writing for the story was also enjoyable for an overall experience with atleast 2 playthroughs needed to get the whole story (you can complete the story with one playthrough but some details will be missing if you choose not to go through the other choices but want the "whole picture"). There aren't too many choices in this sakura rendition compared to others like Sakura Fantasy which was slightly disappointing to me seeing as how regardless of what you choose, the events to occur still lead up to the same style of ending. This differs from the expected since many of the other Sakura games chose to implement the " have the same ending regardless but choose which girl you want to complete the story with" becomes irrelevant with the differences in "routes" being a few extra lines of dialogue to better understand the background story that is barely implied about half way through.  I personally really enjoyed the story seeing as the struggles that the MC go through can be indirectly relatable to many people out there.\n\nFan service is enjoyable as always and the game takes full advantage of its "swim club" themed setting for some lovely suprises. You can expect about 3-4 pages of service shots after completing the game which is about the standard now for recent Sakura releases. You can expect to complete this story (atleast 1 standard runthrough in about more or less 1,5~2 hours based on your reading speed (assuming you are actually reading it and not on auto/skip for the fan service scenes).\n\nThe key drawbacks I would give this visual novel were how I was alittle disappointed with the length of the game seeing as they could have added just a bit more dialogue to fill in small gaps of information that the story lightly delves into. I've noticed with how quickly many of these games come out for the franchise, the stories only get shorter and shorter. The only other draw back was the variation in "routes" seeing as how they went to a different approach to "choose best girl" idea, but it works regardless.\n\nIf this is your first visual novel or first Sakura visual novel on steam, don't go in expecting this to compare with other visual novels. The Sakura franchise is infamous for it's niche style of fanservice + with a story background slipped in. For the standard $9.99 price (promotion of $7.49 at the time of this review), one should not expect a riveting 30+ hour journey of a visual novel, but more so a quick and fun pick up story.\n\nOverall another great addition to the Sakura franchise by WingedCloud + Sekai Project. If you enjoyed the other Sakura games, this is another great story to add to your collection.","September 13, 2015","true","6.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The two girls, referencing the Twin Towers no doubt, also provide a deep philosophical insight into the post 9/11 governmental response, of the bickering between two political parties despite both of their intents being the good of the American people, represented by the main character. Truly a work of art and a standout for its deep thematic elements that rival that of any great work.","October 26, 2015","true","10.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","50","1","2","4","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chrisgiraldo/recommended/402180/","chrisgiraldo","ChrisGiraldo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chrisgiraldo/","511 products in account","I will post my review as always, talking about my personal opinion on the story and making a deep analysis about anything else (art, soundtrack, gameplay, controls, performance, etc.). I will avoid spoilers, but if there is any I would make a good use of this feature.\n\nSakura Swim Club is a short visual novel from Winged Cloud, those responsible to bring the Sakura series to us.\nI already finished the game in about 3 hours (I'm a slow english reader, spanish is my main language), so it's a quite short story, then I patched the game to make it uncensored (the patch adds the sex scenes, h-material).\n\nStoryIt's a bit cliche if you are an into the manganime world. A main male character who entered a new school and get to know two girls... they fall in love with him and we just can imagine what comes next. The only difference I saw here is the ending. Harem ending! The girls agreed with becoming lovers with him at the same time. Lucky b**tard.\n\nThe story is kind of enjoyable, enough to make me go through all of it and keep my interest. It has good and silly moments, quite comic aswell. In the hands of Navel or Key (visual novel makers, known for titles as Shuffle! and Clannad) it could be a pretty deep story. Actually, I would like this visual novel to have an anime adaptation, like I said, in the right hands... Because I pretty much enjoy the drama, the romance and the deep/complicated moments.\n\nNow here they are, the pros and cons:  Pros            Character Design      What can I say, I just love the character design from these guys (Winged Cloud). They are quite talented and have what an amateur artist lacks, the ability to draw a non-frontal body, better yet, a female body. They obviously make the girls more curvy, but it's quite suitable for the ecchi genre.              Art Style      The colours, the use of well made backgrounds and of course, the art and konwlege behind the human anatomy (female curves, actually) is quite outstanding.              Story      Quite enjoyable story, you can identify yourself with some situations and personal issues. It's good enough to keep your interest. It has drama, comedy, romance and if you patch it, h-scenes (explicit sexual content).              Character development      Not much to say about this, but with only 3 main characters, it's easy to tell the difference among their personalities. Leaving the ecchi apart aside, it's pretty good to notice the cuteness of those two girls and the personal struggle of the main character.              (For some of you) Nudity      There is explicit content if you apply the patch. You just have to replace two files in the game folder. Perhaps, for some of you, this sexual content may be a con. I personally think the first sex scene for each girl is forced, out of place. They happened too early and I take them as a plain porn movie.              (Updated) Voice Acting      Voice acting? Yeah! Finally, Winged Cloud managed to add japanese dub to their main characters.              (Updated) Trading Cards      After some time since its release, this visual novel from the Sakura Franchise, finally got Steam Trading Cards.\nCons            Short Story      As I said before, it's a good story, but it's too short. They could made some extra effort to go deeper in the plot and make everything go slower, the events happens so fast that it's silly to think those girls fall in love with the main character that easy (not to mention the first sex scene, it was like a porn movie, "-wanna have sex? -Yes, let's do it."). This story could be much more dramatic and deeper, the romance needs some time to work well along a tale.              Repetitive Music      The soundtrack is fine, but you get tired of hearing the same music again and again. They need to put more variety.              Interaction      There are several decisions to make, but they do not alter the story line, just change the few next dialogs and that's it, then the story continues as default. So, there is only one ending. There is no need for Steam Achievements.\nSo, finally, I decided to recommend this visual novel only if you get it on sale, for a good price. If for any reason you get it for free, give it a chance, play it. As a manganime "fan", I like to try all this kind of games and give them a proper review based on my knowlegde, experience and opinion.\n\nThank you for reading. If you find anything grammatically wrong on this review, please tell me. English is not my main language, so I would like to improve it by noticing my own mistakes.","September 12, 2015","true","9.2"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","7","15","0","0"

When modded this fps platformer has a lot of replayability. The missions and quests are great. The boss battles are really intense and if you dont have Yoshi with you, can be a bit of a challenge.\n\nThe multiplayer community for this game is fantastic. I was matched with a lobby full of neckbearding weeaboos wearing fedoras almost instantly and we were able to play through at least 30 levels of the campaign before they had to go back to browsing memes.\n\nOverall the modding community for this game is great and the multiplayer is pretty good.

Swim Club's story is much more rich and emotional than Angels and Spirit were, and this game is sort of like a combination of the two. For the most part the MC is likeable and relatable, more so than in Angels and much more so than in Spirit. There are moments in the story that really hit home.\n\nOf course the art is as on point as ever, Wanaca is such a great artist. My main gripe with the game was the typos, there were a bit more than I would have liked to see, but they didn't ruin the story.\n\nAll in all, Swim Club is a great Visual Novel and a great installment in the Sakura series. For those of you who don't give a crap about the story and just want the lewd pics I suggest checking out Winged Cloud's Patreon. If you donate you can get an uncensored version.\n\nEDIT 2/11/16: As far as I can tell the japanese dub patch and the uncensored patch can't be used at the same time.","September 12, 2015","true","4.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Because in every other aspect, this game doesn't feel like the 6th installment in the Sakura series, having very low potential on a series that is already pretty lukewarm.\n\nStoryLike Sakura Spirit, nothing too remarkable, in this one however, they took a more down-to-earth tone, however, not compensating with more meat to the bone, even when it gets humorous or "attempts" to be tragic, is still way too basic for its own good, Spirit wasn't much better, but atleast we had a more diverse and exotic type of plot.\n\nCastOh geez, what did they do to you?\nSpoilers aside, you only have two girls, as oppose to the (5?) in Sakura Spirit, it could have been good if each was introduced and dug deep into, but we never learn anything from them besides their latest trauma/worry, our main character isn't any better, needless to say, this results into a very empty attachment with the characters, if not for the fap or waifu material, don't get me wrong they are charming, but the lack of compensation makes it a step backwards.\n\nWritingIs just K, can call a couple of typos and as the previous segments have told already, everything is very voidy in this game, nothing is truly developed to create a... you know... Visual Novel.\nAt times you are given plot options, but the only difference is that one of them triggers a few additional lines of dialogue and the other doesn't, I didn't have much of a problem, but for standing of VNs, this would pass as the barest kind of minimum.\n\nGraphicsWill say, just as good as its previous games, the BGs and your girls are pretty nicely detailed and with the CGs the detail goes all out, showing great... exposition, if you get me.\nNot everything here is bliss though, like Spirit, the number of Portraits is limited (Still more than Spirit anyway) and at times, they can be lacking, losing some cinematography, especially when the girls reveal their problems.\n\nSoundtrackLike the Graphics, it remains pretty solid for the most part, the songs bring various types of beat to them and they generally work good with the situations used, they can get kinda loopy at points, and the music fades-out instead of looping, which bothers me to no end (Spirit did it too, but atleast the tracks were longer).\n\nDurationOH BOY... Just when you thought the strongest and most prominent point of VNs was missed with this one.\nLegit here, it barely took me 1 hour to finish the game, AutoSkip can do it under 7 minutes.\nMost of the game is bland, but this point takes it too far, Spirit atleast lasted 2 hours at bare minimum, in what mindset one releases a Novel as short as this?\nDon't let my playtime decieve you, i just had to run the extra hour because I was getting the Trading Cards.\n\ntl;drI want to like this game, but the sheer simplicity and mediocrity of this game unables me, is not terrible, is just bare and too plain to be a good VN.\nIf you wanna support Winged Cloud, Check out the other Sakura games see if anyone is better, if you are looking for a decent VN, look somewhere else, you ain't gonna find it here.\nIt has the ingredients, it just happens to go by the path of plain functionality.\n\nAs such, i shall grant this game...\nPlain Omelette/10","May 22","false","2.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","2"

Upon transferring to his fourth school this year, he meets meiko and hiromi, two beautiful girls in the swim club. Things haven’t gone well for the swim club lately, but with Kaede’s help, that all changes.\n\nThe story is good, there is a good balance between drama and funny moments throughout. The music that plays along with the story if great to listen to and I hope to see a soundtrack realeased for  Sakura Swim Club.\nI enjoyed reading the story and highly reccomend anyone else that is thinking about buying this visual noval to give it a shot. If you enjoy this style of writing and visualisation I'd also reccomend that you check out their other visual novels, all of which can be found by searching for "Sakura", on the exception of "Winged Sakura: Mindy's Arc".\n\nAlthough I wish that there was an options to set your own name instead of being defaulted to as Kaede, there was nothing wrong with the game other than what I believe to be a typo, which I have contacted them about and should be fixed soon, as with previous experiences. Other than that, I found the story to be enjoyable to read, especially before snoozing off.\n\nI'd definitively reccomend it to people that love to have a good laugh out of a sometimes cheesy story, in which the mood is mostly light and fun.","September 12, 2015","true","4.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198123750907/recommended/402180/","76561198123750907","EyesHerEndHer","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198123750907/","99 products in account","A coming of age story where people surmount life's most difficult challenges like a mother with cancer, a friend being paralyzed by a drunk driver or a disintegrating relationship with a parent. It sounds depressing but guess what? There's BOOBS!\n\n\nI was oddly surprised with Sakura Swim Club.  Having never read ("played") a visual novel before I wasn't quite sure what I was in for.  I had played some choose your own adventure style games like Appointment with F.E.A.R. in which you design your character and make choices throughout the story.  Your choices in these games have immediate consequences and often lead to dead ends.  There are no dead ends in this.  It is truly just a graphic novel on your computer.  Your choices are menial and make no real difference in the story line other than a few new lines immediately after your choice.  So let's break it down.\n\nVisuals: 2/5\nWell, there are well drawn busty anime girls, that is the ultimate benefit to the visuals.  You get to see about 20 images of our two sexy protagonists Mieko and Hiromi.  Other than these shots the rest of the game is pretty lacking in the visuals department. There are about a half dozen backgrounds that are repeated throughout the story. They obviously could have expanded on the environments and background images. There is no animation of any kind.  When you are talking the characters kind of fade out and fade in to a new position and that is the extent of it.  Some panning across the screen or simply guiding the character across the screen would have been a bit exciting.  The other odd part of the visual backgrounds is that there are no people in them.  You end up talking to your teacher in class, but you don't see anyone in the empty classroom.  I found that a bit odd.  Were they too lazy to draw in classmates and a teacher?\n\nGameplay: 1/5\nWell you don't really play anything.  There are under 20 "choices" that you get to make, but they do not change the story.  They merely change a sentence or two after you make your choice.  Your character, Kaede, immediately reconnects with the original plot no matter what choice you make.  So essentially you click through the dialogue.  I took my time, writing notes, taking screen shots etc for videos and finished this graphic novel in under 4 hours.  It will probably take you a lot less.  I believe if you just wanted to cruise through and see the boobs, you could probably rapid click this game in about a half hour.\n\nAudio: 1/5\nThe music in this game is pretty sucky.  There are about a half dozen songs that loop during the chapters.  They loop often though.  Each song is about a minute long and does not loop very well. The songs feel like they were ripped from another game where they actually made sense and fit the mood of the game.  In this novel they do very little to enhance the story.  In fact they distract you from the story because they suck so much.  On a different not, the sound effects and ambient noises are great.  The water for the pool sounds great.  The muddled hall conversations give the reader a feel of being in school.  Not sure how they could do so well on one aspect and completely blew it on the other.\n\nStory Line: 3/5\nThis is the part that blew me away.  I was expecting some cheesy high school relationship banter and some silly hentai situations that result in people seeing each other naked.  Well they have that in here, but they also have some really deep ♥♥♥♥.  We have a protagonist with a serious rift that has torn his relationship with his dad apart.  A girl whose mom is suffering from cancer and another student that has been ostracized after her best friend was paralyzed in a drunk driving accident.  Holy ♥♥♥♥!  I didn't see anything like that coming from previews that I saw.  Thankfully the heavy story line is filled with bouncing breasts to ease the immensely depressing doses of sadness and struggle in this game.\n\nOverall: 2/5\nAt first I felt a bit shorted on the value of this game.  Three hours of game play for more than $5 seemed like a rip.  Then I remembered that this was a graphic novel and thought that I paid about the same price I would pay for a manga at a book store.  I got shafted on the music and was disappointed by the lack direction that different choices took me.  This could easily lead to great replay (reread) value and unlock more boobs.  On the upside, the story was actually kind of serious, the sound effects were decent and the boobs were plentiful.","September 13, 2015","true","3.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

What a way to start into my first ever Sakura title. Going in, I sort of knew what to expect. Coming out, well, it was about what I expected.\n\nSakura Swim Club follows the story of boring Kaede as he transfers to a new school. There, he meets a member of the swim club (by bumping into her in the hallway and getting a full view of her underwear). Things go crazy from there, with "story" points happening just to have the two girls suddenly become exposed. These "story" points mostly make no sense and just don't have an explanation. Sorry, but I've never heard of water being able to rip apart swimsuits or controller cables coming to life and stripping someone.\n\nSure, if you're looking for "that" kind of game then go right ahead. Otherwise, try and just stay as far away as you can. On top of the completely illogical plot, there are also numerous spelling/grammar errors throughout the story. Sakura Swim Club gets a massive do not recommend at all. There are far better visual novels out there.","September 25, 2015","false","11.0"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","6","14","0","0"

This is awful. Even labling it as abysmal isn't really a stretch.\n\nI mean, Winged Cloud's writing capabilities are usually barely the level of a saturday morning children's cartoon in the first place (Sakura Fantasy notwithstanding), but this is a whole new level of atrocious, be it the dialogue or the writing in itself.\nHere's the thing. If you label your game as a "visual" AND "novel", I expect for both to be of a certain level of quality. Though, to be fair, phrasing it like that implies that any sort of effort went into the art. It's basically as minimal effort as one can get.\n\nThe worst of all was the music, though. Here's a bit of a tip, devs. If you want your music to not feel jarring, put in a bit of effort and make it into a proper loop, don't just have it stop and start again five hundred times.\n\nTL;DR: Abysmal writing, awful dialogue, lazy art style, grating music....look into Sakura Fantasy instead or seek something from a different developer.","September 20, 2015","false","4.6"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

However there are spelling mistakes, phrases like "weeks pass" and then the characters talk about events prior that happend "a few days ago", plot disintergrates after second hour and just because sex obsessed towards the end. Not consistant, not a good story overall and ends on a sudden note with no ending to certain issues.\n\nStory: Bad\nThe whole game is basically split into two halfs in its story, the first hour and second hour. The first hour you are intoduced to these three characters (protaganist and both love intrests) and learn about them, develop a connection for each character and care about each characters issues in the game. After being told all these issues, the second hour begins and all of these things are forgotten about and replaced with mindless and poorly written sex scenes. There is NO character development in relation to the first hours issues, these issues are forgotten. The protaganists issues are solved in the second hour BUT the way he fixes them has nothing to do with the problems he is facing. Some of the issues are not resolved so you are left wondereing what will happen to these characters.\n\nArt: Great! but lazy\nThe art is fantastic, background are stunning and character design makes both love intrests look pretty in their own way. However the love intrests are the only drawn characters in the game, unless you count the protaganists 'gengleman' area. A teacher that you talk to is not drawn so you fell like your talking to a chair during these conversations. Parents are via a phone call so this is acceptable but there are no other students or characters in this game, very minimal design.\n","September 22, 2015","false","2.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","1"

The "plot" isn't anything special, the protagonist's relationship with his father being the only real standout. But I can't pretend that anyone purchases these type of games for the story after all! In future installments it would be cool if they introduced audio dialogue for the characters. There is an uncensored patch available on the net if you're interested as well.

Eh, "despite" isn't actually a good word for it, since being a hentai game doesn't really prevent it from having a nice story. People just rarely bother to develop one. Winged Cloud did it right, though.\n\nThis is Sekai Project's first game on Steam that has actual hentai in it (it does need a patch though.) The art is great, and the soundtrack is actually surprisingly good for being a visual novel/h-game. Sometimes I didn't want to advance to the next page because I enjoyed listening to the music so much. (And there were other times where I was too busy looking at the............( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) scenery ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) )\n\nFor $10, it's a pretty great visual novel/h-game with a nice soundtrack, a great story, and kinky hentai. I may be biased to the story since I've had a relationship with two girls at once who both knew and were (somewhat) okay with it, but you don't need to be able to sympathize with the main character in order to enjoy the HOT KINKY HENTAI so trust me, it's $10 well spent.","September 13, 2015","true","3.3"," 12 of 28 people (43%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","43","12","28","4","3"

It seemed like something that was interesting, I never got into it.\nWhen I played this game, put aside everything and came at it from a new and fresh prespective. Even then, it still disappoints me.\n\nYou might saying: "Oh, will, its just something to fap to."\nAlthough its purpose has been astablished, I am still dissapointed because I CAN FAP TO ANYTHING ON THE INTERNET FOR FREE. Plus, if I wanted a game that invloves a lot of clicking, than GET A POINT-AND-CLICK GAME. This has been a waste of money. All you do is click. Nothing to it. The plot is typical and cliche that if I ate a five gallons of letter noddle soup, I could litteraly ♥♥♥♥ a story than this.\n\nDon't buy this unless you're a hardcore fan of anime and willing to waste you're money.\n*EDIT* (Please read)\nAfter reading coments posted after my review, I have realized that I went about this in the wrong way. Usually when it comes to critisms on the internet, I usually ignore. But the users who did comment pointed out that I was in the wrong. Do I still not recammend this? Well, the thumbs down is there for a very good reason. However, the people who where the hardcore anime fans that commented, I apologise. To them and only them. And another apology to fact that yes, its a visual novel and complaing about the clicking is really stupid. And another, this is not a game and should never be judged as one. Which was a mistake that pointed out from another user.\n\nHowever, I will admit that this is bad at best.\n\nNow to address people who are not fans of anime: DO NOT BUY THIS. If you think that this is anime than you are wrong. The is literally a fraction of a nipple away of becoming hentai. Anime is an artstyle that is used in a lot of types of media. (Which was also pointed out by another user)  If you want to get into it than go someone who knows a lot about anime and that someone will point you in the right direction.\n\nTo rap it up: It sucks, don't buy this becuase you can probably get something better than this with one google search, a bottle of lotion, and a box if tissuies.\n\n♥♥♥♥ this.","September 11, 2015","false","0.4"," 69 of 155 people (45%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","45","69","155","18","13"

I originally got it for the nudity, but there was none since Steam took them off some some reason. (Thanks for making me pay $20 for fake hentai Steam)\n\nAnyway, here is my summary of the girls of the game, so SPOILERS AHEAD\n\nHiromi is the cool and mature girl, who often keeps her head cool and has to calm Meiko down whenever she is angry. Her sad part of the story is that her mother has cancer and Hiromi worries that  there will be one day when her mother leaves her for good. But near the end of the story, it says that her mother is getting better\n\nMieko is the tsundere type as she yells and scolds Kaede for being stupid or a pervert, but blushes and loses her self control when he compliments her and saying that she is cute at times. Before Kaede transfered to the school, she and Hiromi had a friend who used to be part of the swim club, till one day she was hit by a drunk driver and was paralyzed from the incident. However, she tried to swim, but nearly drowned as she near the end of the pool, until Mieko and Hiromi were able to save her in the nick of time. Yet, after this incident, the crippled friend started spreading rumors that it was Mieko's fault that she was in that state and thus began the infamous reputation the swim club had in the beginning.\n\nWhile playing this game, I was fondly more emotional toward Mieko's story because she had to live with such a burden. I never thought I would emotionally feel her pain of carrying that lie around and losing a friend like that. Though Hiromi had a bigger chest than Meiko does, (hey, I really a guy with a waifu as an avatar.

I finished the VN 2 times, the choices are almost empty, they change only 3 or 4 lines of text before returning to the main script and have no impact except if you have the hentai patch, with the patch 1 of the choices will have a slight change on 2 CG's and story script.\n\nShould you buy it? if you find it cheap on a sale and are really curious only, it wont hurt you but it wont blow you away either. there are even on steam better alternatives, and outside of steam you will find outstanding visual novels.\n\nI only gave positive recommendation because of the hentai patch, without the patch i think i would not have endured to the end,","November 15, 2015","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is that an unenthusatic main progatonist moves to a new town and a new school and meets two girls and ends up joining the swimming club. From there the story actually gets quite deep. I finished playing the game a few hours ago and I can stay that the main thing that stuck with me was the story.

I like to think of myself as a VN enthusiast, so when I first saw Sakura Swim Club, I thought  it was going to be a load of bogus. I was thinking that there was going to be alot of fan service, perverted moments, etc.\n\nWhile it does have some suggestive themes you would typically see in anime, manga, and VN, it provides a great story. The story is short, but it contains alot of detail about being a nobody, then turning into a sombody after trial and error. The game has a ton of questions which can affect the progression of the game. I haven't gone back to play it again yet, so that piece will be reviewed soon.\n\nOverall I was pleased with Sakura Swim Club. Given the shortness of the game and the lack of full blown content, I can't knock on these guys. It may be a really small dev team that can't provide that much. I advise you play this game, and I give Sakura Swim Club an 8/10.","September 26, 2015","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I originally got it for the nudity, but there was none since Steam took them off some some reason. (Thanks for making me pay $20 for fake hentai Steam)\n\nAnyway, here is my summary of the girls of the game, so SPOILERS AHEAD\n\nHiromi is the cool and mature girl, who often keeps her head cool and has to calm Meiko down whenever she is angry. Her sad part of the story is that her mother has cancer and Hiromi worries that  there will be one day when her mother leaves her for good. But near the end of the story, it says that her mother is getting better\n\nMieko is the tsundere type as she yells and scolds Kaede for being stupid or a pervert, but blushes and loses her self control when he compliments her and saying that she is cute at times. Before Kaede transfered to the school, she and Hiromi had a friend who used to be part of the swim club, till one day she was hit by a drunk driver and was paralyzed from the incident. However, she tried to swim, but nearly drowned as she near the end of the pool, until Mieko and Hiromi were able to save her in the nick of time. Yet, after this incident, the crippled friend started spreading rumors that it was Mieko's fault that she was in that state and thus began the infamous reputation the swim club had in the beginning.\n\nWhile playing this game, I was fondly more emotional toward Mieko's story because she had to live with such a burden. I never thought I would emotionally feel her pain of carrying that lie around and losing a friend like that. Though Hiromi had a bigger chest than Meiko does, (hey, I really a guy with a waifu as an avatar. I like boobs you know) I actually prefer her over Hiromi.","November 8, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'll split it up into sections and then provide an overall.\n\nArt - 8\n\nThe art hasn't changed all that much since the earlier Sakura games, still the same big-boobed designs and similar faces. Not that that is a bad thing, because it is appealing art. What has improved is angle representation and overall anatomical presentation. The characters look more natural in their CGs, which is very important. There is room for improvement, but it's gotten a lot better.\n\nCharacters - 7\n\nFairly cliche characters, which again is not a bad thing, because it's comfortable. The girl's personalities are engaging and entertaining, with Mieko being a classic tsundere and Hiromi being the cool girl. My main qualm with the characters is actually the protagonist. Where these two girls are pouring their hearts out to him and he helps them work through their individual issues, he seems set on refusing any help for his own. It's annoying.\n\nSound - 8\n\nNothing to really write home about. It fulfills it's purpose, and matches appropriate scenes with the proper music for the mood. The sound effects sound fairly natural and nice. They could do with a slightly wider variety of music at longer lengths though. They loop too quickly and too much.\n\nStory and Writing - 7\n\nThese two go hand in hand, so I'm combining them. I won't put any spoilers, but the story is fairly cliche, like much of everything else in the game. Again, not a bad thing. It's comfortable, and has some very amusing parts. The main problem I have is with the pacing. Things move VERY quickly. I know it's hard to complain about the length of a $10 VN when longer full-length VNs are somewhere around $40-50 (although much of that comes from voice acting), but they could definitely have transitioned events better and not time-skipped as much as they did. I feel like there was a lot of wasted opportunity in the story. Not every scene needs a CG to accompany it. The writing for the most part is solid, gets the point across, and the jokes are amusing. Not really much to say here, except they should have given the game a more thorough QC pass before sending it out. I've pointed out a number of easy grammar and spelling errors that any half-decent QC and editor should have noticed and fixed.\n\nOverall - 7\n\nSakura Swim Club is a decent short-length VN with an amusing and sometimes dramatic story. While it's main purpose is certainly showcasing the famous boobs and butts of it's illustrator, it is a fairly fun ride, albeit with some quirks and definitely has room for improvement. It moves along a bit too quickly to really get attached to the characters and their various personal issues, so it has pacing problems, but it tells it's story well enough in the time it's allowed. I'd say it's worth it's $10 price tag.","September 18, 2015","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I originally got it for the nudity, but there was none since Steam took them off some some reason. (Thanks for making me pay $20 for fake hentai Steam)\n\nAnyway, here is my summary of the girls of the game, so SPOILERS AHEAD\n\nHiromi is the cool and mature girl, who often keeps her head cool and has to calm Meiko down whenever she is angry. Her sad part of the story is that her mother has cancer and Hiromi worries that  there will be one day when her mother leaves her for good. But near the end of the story, it says that her mother is getting better\n\nMieko is the tsundere type as she yells and scolds Kaede for being stupid or a pervert, but blushes and loses her self control when he compliments her and saying that she is cute at times. Before Kaede transfered to the school, she and Hiromi had a friend who used to be part of the swim club, till one day she was hit by a drunk driver and was paralyzed from the incident. However, she tried to swim, but nearly drowned as she near the end of the pool, until Mieko and Hiromi were able to save her in the nick of time. Yet, after this incident, the crippled friend started spreading rumors that it was Mieko's fault that she was in that state and thus began the infamous reputation the swim club had in the beginning.\n\nWhile playing this game, I was fondly more emotional toward Mieko's story because she had to live with such a burden. I never thought I would emotionally feel her pain of carrying that lie around and losing a friend like that. Though Hiromi had a bigger chest than Meiko does, (hey, I really a guy with a waifu as an avatar. I like boobs you know) I actually prefer her over Hiromi.","November 8, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Of course, to be fair, I enjoy the Sakura series of games (Sakura Spirits and Sakura Angels) :I like the art and the character designs in the game.  I also like how Winged Cloud presents the male protagonists (aka - the dude you control) and in this case the guy was just coasting along, apathetic toward everything when he meets Hiromi and Mieko and ends up join the swim club with them.  He isn't King Stud who gets all the girls, but he isn't quite an "everyman" either.  I mean Kaede (our hero in this game) is, in my opinion, someone who many of us can relate to in that he has so many other people telling what to do with his life that his only defense is apathy (I went to high shcool with a couple of guys like this).\n\nNow, there's a lot of cheesecake here (even more with R18 patch ), and there might even be a love story that ranges from sappy to unrealistic  However, this story also focuses on three people that due to circumstances they cannot control, are deeply unhappy with the directions their lives are going in and turn to each other to give themselves the strength they need to get a grasp on their lives and steer themselves in a better direction.\n\nSo yeah, there's gonna be T&A (or allusions to it).\nThere's gonna be sex (if you patched it out).\nBut there's also a very pleasant human story in the midst of all that and it's one that almost anybody can enoy no matter what the rating of your particular game may be.","November 28, 2015","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

SLIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD (nothing that doesent become clear starting the game)\n\nNON-SPOILERY PLOT SYNOPSIS\n\nSakura Swim Club is a visual novel in which you follow the story of our protaginist, Kaede who has just tranferred to a new school.  However Kaede has had a long history of moving from school to school, as his parents have very high expectations of him, and because of it. Struggles to make and keep friends.\n\nTime goes on and Kaede becomes aware of the various school clubs available to him, after hearing rumors about the Swim Club he becomes curious and investigates. There, he meets 2 girls and the story unfolds from there.\n\nACTUAL REVIEW PART:\n\nAs for those who have played any of the other Sakura games, in my opinion this is the best one so far. And for those who havent, I still think you should give this a read, and here is why.\n\nExcellent visual: I really like the way the artist draws the characters. It is very easy on the eyes and has a very light hearted and soft look to it, giving the characters a very inviting look. All jokes aside, the mature patch you can get for this game I would say is well worth it (if your into that sorta thing)\n\nDecent music: While the music dident really blow me away, it was pretty good, however it does loop so it might get a little annoying, but you could always mute it if a particular track gets on your nerves so I give it a pass.\n\nGameplay: The way the game plays is self explanitory, your more reading then anything but the game still gives you choices as far as what to do in certain situation, which will either change dialogue or give you a different piece art to add the the gallery, its not much but its something\n\nStory: I have played Sakura Angels, Spirit, and Fantasy, and while Fantasy was my favourite for a while, this ones story hit very close to home for me and though you may think I am a little biased because of that, I believe that everyone can relate to Kaede in some degree, especially those with school related struggles.\n\nAnother thing that sets this one from the others in the series is the realism. Your not a dude thrown into an imaginary word full of girls with magical powers trying to stop the big bad evil guy, your just a guy who is struggling with problems that people struggle with all the time in our day and age, this allows you to connect to him much more easily and makes the feels much more powerful. (that being said there is still lots of "plot" whether you get the adult patch or not)\n\nOVERALL OPINION:\n\nOverall, Sakura Swim Club is a great read for anyone looking to get a good. Engaging story, filled with relatable characters and gorgeous art, but also for those who are just looking for a nice little escape from reality and just like to enjoy its more "simple" aspects, but I think the other entrys in the series are better at the simplistic, harem style story. Either way I can confidently reccomend that you buy it and give it a shot.\n","February 1","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Or Sakura Beach 1 and 2? How bout Sakura Angels? Sakura fantasy? Then boy do I have a suprise for you! In Sakura Swim Club you play the role of another faceless sexually repressed male lead who refuses to take up any opportunity to smash. Instead you get to sit back on this linear rollercoaster ride of pointless banter and sexual tension only to be frustrated in the end because you got nothing of value. It's like a strip club, but with more pixels and less money involved. But hey there's a hentai patch so I guess its worth.\n\nTL;DR: Hentai patch = muy beuno\n10/10 would path again.","June 2","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I wanted to try out one of these ecchi visual novels to get a feel for them, but I didn't know exactly what to expect going in. Was it going to be good? Bad? Was it going to be sexy? Who cares. The story is so bad that it ruins any aspect of the game for me. Yeah, the girls are cute and the background images are nicely detailed and made, but without a realistic story there isn't any substance. I won't buy another one of these.\n\nAlso, I may seem cynical about my purchase of this game, but I did enjoy trying something new compared to the rest of my games. Try it out and see if you'll like it.","June 6","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
