A fairly standard example of the genre, I went in not expecting much and was pleasantly surprised.\n\nYou play as Janet Bhaskar, a young Indian college student who ends up stranded in the middle of a forest with her blind date.  Finding their way to a secluded mansion, once entered, will they ever make it out again?  I don't want to give away much more than that as the plot relies on mystery and the unfolding of the narrative through the individual character routes. The story won't blow you away in depth, characterization or plot twists, but it's a fun sci-fi tale that has some interesting ideas and nicely written dialogue.  As an otoge (girl game), the interaction between the protagonist and the guys is quite enjoyable and there are some saucy situations that may satisfy your romantic tastes, although nothing too racy, deep or profound.  But who says every romance needs to end in tears, anyway?\n\nWhile the story is pretty good, the artwork is where things suffer somewhat. The standard character images are good, nothing spectacular but nice enough; it's the special event CG's that really stick out.  As much as I hate to say it, the quality reminds me of the more amateur deviant-art pages I've seen. I feel really bad for saying that because I love Hanako Games, but it was very distracting reading through the event scenes when the quality of the CG's were so poor. Usually I'm able to overlook lesser quality art in visual novels if it has a strong, intriguing storyline with well-developed characters, however, I really can't say that's the case here.  Again, the story is good, it's just not strong enough to outshine the issues with the artwork.\n\nDespite the problems I had with it, I still enjoyed Date Warp. Although on the shorter side, I felt it was worth the 6 hours I put into completing the entire story.  I wouldn't consider it one of Hanako's better titles, but it's definitely worth a look if you've enjoyed her other games and/or other visual novels.\n\nBottom Line: 6/10","October 24, 2014","true","8.2"," 91 of 96 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","91","96","4","3"

Even though it may be the weakest of all Hanako titles so far, it definitely is interesting and entertaining enough to present you 6-7 hours of playtime.\n\nJanet Bhaskar is a freshman in Brooke College, Memphis. She is an introverted young woman who never dated before, and agrees to go on a date with young jock Bradley Dalton to appease her roommate, Vanessa. They go on a pretty much text book date without much attraction and got hit by a furious storm in the middle of the night while they were trying to go back. Bradley’s car gets busted in the middle of nowhere and phones do not pick any signal, yet luckily Janet manages to spot the lights of a mansion nearby. They decide to ask for help, and spend the night there if necessary. Unbeknownst to them, they may never leave...\n\nThis pretty otome game feels like a cross over between Rocky Horror Picture Show and a random episode of X-Files, with many enjoyable cultural and science fiction references. I must confess that both the narrative writing, and the concept choice is way better than I expected it to be. Characters are vivid and interesting as typologies, yet considering it is a short VN, there hasn't been much space for actual character depth. Janet is well developed as a character, yet none of the romance options are spectacular. We observe some interesting hooks without much in game development. The ending is somewhat cheesy and predictable too, with a taste for "all for one, one for all."\n\nGameplay is pretty generic, with description to read and choices to make to follow one of the character paths. The choice option though, comes with a wiring mini game for you to enjoy. It's like a pipe game, but with wires. It is cute and presents a casual feeling for your relaxation.\n\nMy one annoyance would probably be the art work and CGs used in the game. I usually do not care much for graphic quality but most of the pictures felt like taken from amateur deviantart pages, with odd disproportions and an obvious lack of care for the coloring. Actual character animations were not that bad, just not attractive, especially compared to Hanako's other game titles.\n\nOh, well. Not every game in the genre is a masterpiece. Still, here is an otome VN with 5 different characters and 11 endings harbored with brain scratchers. The story itself comes in to conclusion, sure, but the setting itself feels well-built enough to be visited by Hanako's future games. Who knows?\n\n*Lyrics from Rocky Horror Picture Show - The Time Warp\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","January 22","true","11.0"," 45 of 47 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","45","47","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/301380/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","Visual novels have become quite a thing on Steam these days and Date Warp is another one of those games. It involves a good amount of reading (hence the term ‘visual novel’) and in my opinion isn’t really a game because it involves very little gameplay. But from time to time you play/read a VN that is worth your time, and Date Warp is just that.\n\nLet me start by saying that Date Warp isn’t a long game. One playthrough will take you about 2 hours to complete. Did you see how I specifically put the word ‘one’ there ? That’s because the story isn’t entirely clear after you finish it for the first time. It’s meant be played multiple times with different choices every time. The developer has told me you have to compare the multiple routes to understand the whole story and that only by taking multiple routes you will unlock the true ending. Mysterious, isn’t it ? Well, it actually is. The writing is very good and detailed (but with an occasional typo), and each of the characters has their own personality. Because of this you should be able to empathize with most of them, or the main characters anyway.\nI have to admit that I was hoping to see a different kind of story here, because about 1/4th into the game the game takes a different path, one that changes from 100% mystery into sci-fi (with still a fair bit of mystery, so don’t be disappointed !). I still liked the transition and I enjoyed the game way more than I thought I would.\nThere is a bit of gameplay integrated too, and even if you officially couldn’t call it that it’s what sets this game apart from other VNs. Occasionally the game will let you choose what to do and instead of just clicking on an option the game wants you to complete a small puzzle. You have a starting point and you have to connect the lines to the answer you want to give. It’s a system anyone who’s ever played a puzzle should be familiar with.\n\nVisuals are quite important for a visual novel I think. You’re telling a story so you want people to connect with your characters. Unfortunately Date Warp has some mixed graphics. The graphics are sharp and have plenty of detail most of the times and the surroundings/areas are created with accurate details, but the characters themselves have, well, let’s say not-so-good designs (that’s one way to put it gently). It would be nice to see a VN with realistic looking characters for once but so far every VN I’ve encountered uses the same anime-style graphics. Which are usually fitting and don’t distract from the overall experience, as long as they’re drawn in a competent way. But no, I haven’t read tons of visual novels, so maybe I just haven’t looked good enough. Anyway, the character designs in Date Warp range from okay to good. They’re not bad, not at all, but they’re not great either. There are also a few animations here and there but nothing major and enough to give you a sense of looking at something more dynamic.\nThe music is subtle as are the little sound effects like thunder and rain. All that’s missing is voice acting, but that’s debatable. I, for one, didn’t miss it but I can understand if some people would.\n\nDate Warp might not be the prettiest visual novel you’ll ever play but it’s definitely one with a lot of replay value. Its mysteriousness is what keeps it interesting and if you’re an avid reader you’ll definitely want to play through it several times to just make sense of it all.\nIf you’re not into visual novels, or at least not that much, then Date Warp would be a good starting point. It’s small enough so that anyone can finish it and you’ll instantly know if this genre is for you.\nI am gladly recommending this in any case.\n\n[Rating: 77/100]","September 4, 2014","true","3.3"," 31 of 36 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","31","36","0","1"

Usually in a VN you will pick a character to persue and their story will take you though a plot that is independant of anyone and anything else and recycles pictures of characters with different color schemes to fill different roles.\n\nDate Warp, possibly by the nature of everyone being trapped in the house, does a fantastic job of telling different stories based on who you choose to follow that all meld together to make a complete whole. Each story only ADDS to the overreaching plot and none of them contridicts any other, which I have never seen before in any other VN or life sim game.\n\nI made my initial two choices for guys to follow based on my usual preferences, lecherous and cold/angry guys first.  They tend to have more interesting stories than nice guys... However when I decided to get around to completing the other story arcs I was shocked to find that chasing a different boy ended up adding even more depth to the others. Secrets I had never even guessed were there before were revealed, personalities were fleshed out even more, and I actually found myself interested in reading the last two stories where I had not been before.\n\nI played the original "bronze" version quite some time ago as I purchased it from Hanako's site.  I'd like to note that I own many games made by Hanako and their customer service is top notch.  All it took was an email with a copy of my original order info to get a link to download the new version and a steam key to boot within 24 hours.  I'm looking forward to any games they make in the future. If the art style of this game puts you off check out some of the others; the artist changes from game to game and the art in The Royal Trap is really, really, nice with realistic features rather than an Anime style.\n\nBack to my original train of thought however... The added epilogue and extra pictures really add a nice sense of finality to the story where it felt slightly lacking before. They were obviously done at a later date and look different, though I think the same artist was used, it would be nice to have seen more of the art overhauled but I don't think that's realistic to expect.\n\nI highly recommend this game as well as The Royal Trap, Magical Diary, and Long Live the Queen. The latter two you can find on steam and LLtQ has quite the cult following.","October 4, 2014","true","10.5"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","15","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zhuinden/recommended/301380/","zhuinden","Zhuinden (人^▽')～","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zhuinden/","2363 products in account","DATE WARP is a visual novel with multiple paths and endings (11 endings, to be exact - 2 endings for each romance path, and a final "true ending" is unlocked once the others have been reached), created by Kanako Games, mostly known for the game LONG LIVE THE QUEEN, but also the creator of "MAGICAL DIARY".\n\nIf that doesn't sell you the game to you instantly, I'm surprised. LLTQ is amazing in its optimization for min-maxing while also providing enough room to successfully complete the game in multiple ways, while MD was a well-written dating sim.\n\nIf you've played Magical Diary, you possibly know that the characters written by Kanako tend to have actual personalities and depth, which makes the chatter of the characters quite enjoyable. That is true for this game as well, as the primary focus of the game is its story.\n\nThe plot of DATE WARP itself is interesting enough that you'll possibly end up trying to get every ending, not just so that you'll unlock the achievements like I did (well, I had already seen all the endings while my friend was playing, so my playtime is an indicator of me fast-forwarding rather than actual game length.)\nI don't feel like going into detail because, you know, *everything is a spoiler*, but overall, after seeing every ending, it makes perfect sense, despite being MINDF***.\n\nI sure hope you'll take your time to check it out. I did play through the game with fastforward just to put it up on my profile as an achievement showcase, after all.\n\np.s.: LINDS is entertaining, I'd almost buy the game just to get to romance him, haha.","December 25, 2014","true","3.9"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","12","15","2","0"

As with all otome games some routes will be less enjoyable than others depending on your tastes but what I liked best was the mystery-solving aspect, getting new scraps of information in every route to piece together the backstory and figure out what was going on. If anything the romance kinda sticks out considering that the protagonist barely knows any of the guys and the game takes place over just a few short days, though again that's handled better in some routes than others.\n\nThe protagonist is a positive point for me. She has a good design and personality rather than just being a blank slate, and like the plot bits of her backstory are revealed as you play the multiple routes, which was a really interesting idea.\n\nThe little puzzles for picking dialogue options weren't really bad, just pointless, and the game could stand to be slightly cheaper imo. More variation in the designs for the love interests would be good too, but sadly that's true of most entires in the genre. But if you like a bit of sci-fi/fantasy with your dating sim or just something a little different then this is more than just another paint-by-numbers otome.","January 18","true","8.6"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

The pace and setting for this game is done very well, and parts of the story gets unfolded as you progress. Regardless of music, art or writing, everything is very well put together and creates a nice brooding mood. It's the kind of game that makes you pick at your brain as you try to figure out each person's character and intentions, slowly realising there's more to them than it appears. You will also be required to do several playthroughs and achieve different endings before you get a perspective of the truth. For visual novels, characters are of utmost importance, and I'd say this game scores pretty high on character development with not one person being too much of a saint or devil to be believable. The only minor setback is that the protagonist has a relatively strong personality, and it tends to reflect that in the choices available.\n\nThere's an overall faint, drawn out tension that will keep haunting at the back of your mind, which pans out for a solid gameplay without making you feel queasy or uncomfortable the way some panic-driven games do. All things considered, this is definitely worth a try and if you enjoy reading, mysteries or "choose your own adventure" novels, all the more you shouldn't miss it.\n\nPS. In case anyone is wondering about my playtime, I had purchased the original non-Steam download (which I've clocked in almost a full day of playtime) and have only recently asked for the Steam keys.

It took little more than an hour to go through it, and while there are multiple endings those won't take too long to see either. The puzzle gimmick you go through as you are making a choice in this game adds nothing but making those decisions take a little longer. Overall, it's hardly the best VN i've ever played (far from it), but it isn't bad either. I'd call it competent and a nice way to spend an evening.

The story was very well written and enjoyable when all is said and done. I will definitely go back soon to do another path. My only problem was that the final act moved at such a rapid pace.

Those 2 complaints aside, this is well worth the money.","September 2, 2014","true","2.8"," 27 of 49 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","27","49","0","0"

It's rewarding finding out more bits of information about the characters and mysteries as you go through all the routes.\n\nThe endings. Obviously, I don't want to spoil anything here but I will say that the majority of the endings aren't typical otome game endings. Even the good ends don't necessarily end on a 'happily ever after.' This surprised me a lot at first but I soon got used to it and ended up enjoying it (some endings felt a bit too open but that might have been because they were my fave characters and I wanted more).\n\nThe puzzles. I actually really enjoyed the puzzle feature when you had to make a choice. It's something I haven't seen before and it made me actually think about the choice before I made it.\n\nThe grown-up feel and the protag. Even though the protag was inexperienced in the love department, she felt like a university student. I'm so used to playing as a high school student in these kinds of games so it was refreshing to play as someone older who isn't afraid of flirting (Linds' route was fab for this).\n\nThe artwork is generally good but not as good as the more recent hanako games. The sprites used throughout the game were really good, some of the CGs looked a bit awkward though.\n\nCons\n\nIf I had to be picky, it would have been nice to see more CGs in the character routes. Also, the game was quite repetitive but that's to be expected in games like these because you have to replay conversations so you can pick different options.\n\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed playing Date Warp and would recommend this game.","October 27, 2014","true","9.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","0"

I wouldn't lump it in with most otome games, really, so you might find that you like this one even if you don't like otome - or that you don't like it even if usually you like otome.\n\n\n\nFinally got to the new content! It was a nice little surprise, tying it a bit better than in the original version (which I've played when this originally came out).\n\nWhat I've always liked about this visual novel is that it's not your average dating-sim - though it probably does look like that at first and even second glance; which I would imagine would have ostracised part of its possible audience - there's an overarching story which you understand better and better the more routes you manage to play but it takes a while to understand something more interesting is there for you to find out.\nThe graphics don't help it much to garner a wider audience: would you believe that Janet, the protagonist, is 19? I'd have been fooled into thinking this was all about dating pretty boys, given the sort of style - which seems to be the kind of shoujo-inspired style that would indeed go with that kind of story.\n\nIt would be impossible to go too much in detail about even the genre (I don't remember how much the demo reveals, so I'm not risking spoiling it), but don't take this for what it *looks* like.\n\nAs for the actual story and the characters: while this is probably my favourite EVN, I think there's a lack of polish compared to stuff like, say, Ever 17, which - in turn - wasn't perfect either, with all of its filler. The final resolution is a bit cheesy, but with the added CG it kind of looks like they're going for it after all! If you don't mind things not necessarily being plausible (such as a major event like Susan never disappearing only resulting in minor changes, with Janet and Brad finding that they're dating in this timeline) you'll probably have fun figuring out what the hell is actually going on in the mansion.\n\nOther than the decision-making mini game, there aren't any other elements of traditional game play and, even then, this is never challenging and is more of a distraction, which I actually welcomed. If you don't like it, you can skip it on subsequent play-throughs, provided you've made those decisions already.\n","September 21, 2014","true","7.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

I think I paid $4 for this game becasue it was on sale for Christmas through Hanako Gmaes's website.Unlike the other two, the game is just purely visual novel with choices, so there is no stat raising or any thing. It is a fairly short game, it tok me more than 3 hours to complete, but I am also a fast reader.\nYou play as a ninteen year old college student named Janet, who is on her first date with a guy named Bradley. So far the date has been disappointing, the car breaks down, and you managed to find a mansion to look for help. Eventually you realize that you along with the mansion's inhabitants are locked inside the mansion by a force field.\nIt's a dating sim, so all of the male characters (5), which is everyone besides yourself, are romanceable. There are a total of 11 endings, each guy has a good and a bad ending, and then there is an aditional ending that unlocks once you have done all the others. The romances are not very in depth becasue it is a short game and the total time spent game wise is about 4 days.\nFor the price it is a cute otome game. Personally I prefer Magical Diary, and I also like the art in that one better. Regardless I like to support visual novels on Steam, and if you like to support visual novels, especially English ones, then you should pick this one up the next time Hanako is having a sale on its website.","December 24, 2014","true","3.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","3","4","2","0"

It is quite clear that this wasn't drawn by a professional. Secondly , there are a lot of plot holes. Several questions are not answered even if you unlock the true ending. Of course this is a story about time travel so some plot holes are inevitable but I still feel that the author took it too far , combining science fiction and magical elements but without really explaining anything. I don't want to spoil the story to anyone who wants to play it, but whoever has already bought it knows what I'm talking about.\nThirdly , this game feels a little short for the 10 euros you have to spend in order to buy it, but at least there are multiple endings so it has some replay value.\nThat being said, I do not regret buying this game because as I mentioned before, it is enjoyable. Some of the characters are adorable and the story can be interesting if you ignore all the plot holes. I also liked the little puzzles they added every time you had to choose an option in the story, it is a nice, original idea for visual novels.\nIn conclusion , I recommend this game if you're a hardcore visual novel fan , willing to overlook the few problems it has.","December 7, 2014","true","21.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

The player takes on the role of Janet Bhaskar, a chemistry student at Brooke College, Memphis. Having been set up on a blind date with a football jock, their night together begins the greatest, or worst, adventure Janet would ever have. What happens? You'll have to find out yourself.\n\nThe art style is crisp and cute, though you can see differences between it and Hanako Games' later titles. The music selection is mood-fitting, and the story is well-written. A novel feature is that, instead of merely selecting dialogue choices, you play a minigame which is similar to a maze of wires, which you need to connect in order to 'power up' the dialogue options. It doesn't entirely feel fitting, but it's certainly a neat distraction.\n\nAll in all, it's a game that will keep you guessing. With 12 endings to shoot for, there's more reason to replay and see how different choices will impact the story.","September 5, 2014","true","2.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

One which you learn in every route and he cools down after the reveal of, this isn't a case of 'You MUST play this one's route to ever see them as more than a dillweed!'\n\nOne thing I really like about it is that the different routes don't just show you a bigger picture of the guy you've chosen to focus on this time, they each show you a bigger picture of Janet. Say, if you play Alben's route first you'll get some hints about something bad happening to her a year before, but then you play Linds' and find out the actual details. It keeps her from getting boring.\n\nThe one thing I didn't really like was the minigames for selecting conversation choices. It just didn't feel like it added anything (other than showing off what I do realize is an impressive bit of coding for the Ren'py engine) and it would be nice if there was a choice in the options to turn them off all together instead of just getting to skip ones you've already done (if you're choosing the same option again). There are a few choices that're big enough that it could work as showing Janet's mind being tangled up with confusion she needs to push through to decide what to do, but things like deciding whether to be polite or pushy about getting into the house aren't things she should need time to detangle her thoughts for.","June 20, 2015","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

WHICH IS good.\n\nGameplay 9/10. This is a really really interesting game, and I love that you cannot "skip" playing the minigame unless you've already unlocked that text choice, so it makes you work for the endings that you want, and it is phenomenal. The skip choices option is great, and this game has full gaming controller support which means that restricting yourself to a keyboard is not necessary. The gamepad controls work great and the actual skip options do as well. This is really really well done in the case of gameplay. The only thing I would have liked a little more would be a few more different options for games depending on game-path or to have choices be harder to make if the path you're on is a negative one/non true path.\n\nArtwork 5/10. The art in this game isn't terrible nor is it phenomenal. It's just there. The cg's aren't special to look at but the art does not detract from the gameplay in any way. The art in this game is just okay to me. the backgrounds are fairly stylish but some of the art/overlays in the imagery and game are really poorly/lazily done which made the game less appealing to me overall. The art is also pretty small in this as the overlay/ui hud takes away from the art in the game, which is fine - but it doesn't really add to how the images look.\n\nMusic/Audio 6/10. This is also nothing special. The music in the game can be interesting as it changes depending on situations and circumstances, but it's not really great and at times makes the game less interesting as it takes away from certain things, but does build suspence in some cases so that's interesting.\n\nOverall: I liked Date Warp for the actual gameplay, the text ui and the controller support made the actual replayability of the game well worth it for me. That said there are places that datewarp could update on. Full voice acting, and a better artist are two of my personal suggestions on this.\n\nI would recommend this game, at the end of everything and found it very fun the first time I played it so it's mostly positive things.

But this one put a bit of spin on things. Towards some guys there's no clear romantic path. And although each guy has a couple of endings if you pursue them, some of them have no ending that you would really call a "Happy ending".\n\nThere's also a bit of mystery thrown in there for good measure. The puzzles you had to solve to make path selections got a little bit annoying after a while, but thankfully on subsequent playthroughs you can skip the puzzles for selections you've already made.","September 13, 2015","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chaoseed/recommended/301380/","chaoseed","John","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chaoseed/","594 products in account","It's a fun visual novel. The sci-fi story is intriguing; it's not really 'hard' sci-fi, but it's fun. It's actually more dramatic, even tragic than you might expect. The characters are well-written and three-dimensional; the protagonist, Janet, is especially believable. Incidentally, it's what you might call an 'otome' game, in that 'you' are female and you get to romance a number of young men. It's actually quite sweet at times.\n\nThe gameplay isn't much more than a Choose Your Own Adventure. When you come to a choice, you play a little pipe-rotation minigame; It's kind of a gimmick, but it doesn't come up enough to overstay its welcome. (If you've done a choice before, you can 'skip' it, though when you skip you can only choose choices you've chosen before!) The graphics are fine, though some of the portraits do occasionally seem a bit amateurish. The incidental music is fine; the theme song is actually pretty catchy. There are eleven endings; the "true" ending is only available by first getting all the other endings. It's not TOO difficult to figure out how to get them. I went through over a week or so and enjoyed it all.\n","July 31, 2015","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Janet was able to see a light and both followed the light that Janet saw. Janet and Bradley found out that the light was coming from a mansion. Once they both entered the mansion little did they know that the adventure begins in the mansion. Yup this game takes place on a mansion and I love that setting with mystery thrown into the mix. I always had a ton of fun reading the mansion cases in Detective Conan.\n\nThis game also has sci-fi thrown into the mix with romance too.\n\nYou have five guys you can romance. Each guy as two endings a good and bad ending plus one true end. Thankfully there is a guide in here so I recommend to use the guide here if you are stuck on achieving an end. There are 11 endings to get for this game.\n\nAs others have said below the character Janet is really a well developed character. I really did like her character a lot.\n\nThe art for the game could of been better but it's not as bad as it could of been. The music for the most part was enjoyable.\n\nOther than that I enjoyed playing this visual novel a lot. I would give this a chance.

I am always fond of stories that have the protagonist trapped in an isolated building with strangers since I am always curious to see what will happen to them. After playing this game, I was sort of disappointed, but it was enjoyable to say the least.\n\nI didn’t find any of the plot twists to be that interesting or shocking. The mini-game that plays during choices could have been cut out entirely and the gameplay would lose nothing. Some of the CGs look ridiculous and can ruin the mood of some scenes. For example, one CG involving Bradley was supposed to create a shocking and suspenseful atmosphere. Except, I was laughing for 3-minutes at how bad Bradley’s design looks in the CG.\n\nDespite what I have said so far, this is an enjoyable game. The user interface is easy to use. The character sprites look colorful. The story is good, although I find the romance element more enjoyable than the mystery element in my opinion.
