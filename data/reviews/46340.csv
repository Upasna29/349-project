Good mix of Empire Total War (controlling AI), and CoH [Company of Heroes] (Independent AI). Good game for anyone who loves hardcore strategy, realism, or just having fun with history. Graphics are stunning and the realism is mindblowing, this game going all the way down to naming each and every bot, with non repeating names!

Though there isn't that much hardware that you can get your hands on the stuff that you do get is very well modelled. M3 medium tanks are my favorite because it's so fun to see them roll down a hill mowing down infantry with their MG turret, shooting an armored car with their 37mm, and shooting a pzIII with their 75mm. It is a shame that there aren't more vehicles. The only British vehicle that appears is the valentine (Only one that appears in campaign idk if more) but if you are expected to see the iconic british vehicles that ruled the desert like the churchhill, matilda, or the crusader, you will be kept waiting. Most American vehicles make an appearance including two variants of the M4. The only iconic vehicle missing from the germans garage are the spgs based off of the pzIII chasis like the stug. The Germans have by far the most complete arsenal as they have multiple variants of the pzIII&IV, multiple armored cars and apcs, and the famous Tiger.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nAll combat is fully modelled. This is not COH where the max range of a tank gun is a 50 meters. In fact, most cannons can shoot across the entire map (though they won't penetrate armor very good that way). Any thing your units can see they can shoot assuming that their target is not outside their maximum range which will be a problem with smgs but will rarely happen with anything else. A tricky part of commanding is putting your assets in places where they have fields of fire. In most rts if a bump in the terrain or part of the crest a hill is blocking the fire the game will let the bullet travel though the obstruction. This is not a game where you can micro manage things other than the major assets. The major flaw in this game is control. It is how you say, not very good. For starters the default move order is a fire and move drill which is useful for tanks which don't have to stop to fire but will get your infantry killed all the time as they stop to fire for a few seconds, move a couple of meters, then repeat instead of just running into their trench. There is also an incredibly irritating latency to orders given to infantry and sometimes they simply ignore what you are telling them to do. Try to tell them to get in cover while they are in a fire animation? They will spend 3 seconds getting fired at before listening. The controls of the vehicles are passable at best. There is not way to tell vehicles to orient their armor without telling them to advance and sometimes they will stop firing for no reason or repeatedly fire at a target they have no hope of penetrating meanwhile infantry are right next to them lobbing AT grenades. The biggest negative is that there were FAAAR too many defense missions. More than 75% of the were defensive missions and half of those were pure defensive which means that you don't need to move your troops around at all. Some of them however required skillful use of vehicles to reinforce sectors and skillful placement of AT guns to maximize their effectiveness.","December 10, 2014","true","28.4"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

Suddenly a loud crack! the fighting compartment of the Tenente Spaggetti's Autoblinda is lit up with a blinding flash! The crew bails out but is quickly surrounded by men of the British Army. Luckily none of the British AI could path their way out of a wet paper bag and they are repelled by the equally confused Italian tank crew who are busy circling their own tank yelling "Aiuto, Auito!". The British never had a chance!\n\nThis is largely my experience playing Theatre of War 2: Africa. Having played ToW3: Korea, i should have seen this coming. But i'd heard good things about this game and i was drawn in by the fact that it's a world war two game that isn't about 'murrica saving the world or Russian stereotypes. Speaking of Russian stereotypes all of the voice acting in this game is apparently done by one, and one of the few joys of this game is hearing a Russian guy impersonate the British accent. Tally Ho commrade!\n\nOther than that this game is a mess. The AI is so bad that it feels like its actively ignoring you just to be a prick. Orders are followed only in the loosest sense of the word "followed". Most of the time you'll lose. When you do win it's not because of tactical supperiority. Its not because of clever placement of units, or hitting their armor in its weak spots. You win because you started off with more men and tanks. I played the first US mission for the DLC. My two supporting tanks were destroyed before they could be of any use and my own tank crew were frozen with fright 500 metres before they were even in range to take damage. I know other people have managed to slog through it but honestly i don't see the point. Having to restart a level because my tank crew is too busy wetting their pants is not tactical realism. Its frustrating.\n\nOn the plus side, everything is accurately modelled and looks pretty good for an older game. If they put as much effort into the AI as they did into making sexy tanks, they'd have a decent game.\n\nAlso i've logged a frightening amount more hours into this game than steam says. i dunnow what that's about","December 27, 2015","false","1.9"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","73","8","11","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DivineFrog/recommended/46340/","DivineFrog","DivineFrog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DivineFrog/","295 products in account","This game predates Men Of War (MoW), but will definitely appeal to anyone who is fond of those games.  It is similar to MoW in that it is an in-depth combat simulation involving anything from infantry to vehicles to planes, each with their own inventories, names, and experience.  It diverges from MoW in that the engagement distances and overall scale of things is far closer to reality.  Tanks can actually thow mass several km downrange and still have lethal momentum.  Even rifles can shoot several hundred meters.  It is slower paced than MoW, but is larger scale and is much more persistent in the single player, with infantry and crew members each gaining experience that you get to allocate into their different aspects and medals that you get to award them.  Everything carries over from one campaign battle to the next, and what you've got is what you've got: losing armor or entire squads really hurts.  All in all, it is a clunky but very respectable (even lovable) game and certainly has it's sights on what's important.  I hope they make a Theatre of War 4 with engine and interface improvements, more factions, and the ability to play a drop-in multiplayer campaign.  That will be an instant buy.","July 10, 2013","true","1.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Let us talk about the selling points of the product\n1. The AI\nThe ghost in Pac man probably are more complex than the AI in this game.\na. There is no path finding. For example units will not follow roads, even in cases where you start them on roads, but will head in a straight line to their destination unit they hit something and must turn.   There is a stage where you fight on the road between high cliffs. When the AI travels it does not follow the road but hits a straight line until it gets stuck on a hill side that is to steep so it turns a bit and repeats the procedure. So if the road has a curve to it the unit does not follow the curve but makes a zig zag motion til it reaches its destination\nb. AI allies are about worthless. There are stages where you fight and your re-enforcements are AI allies. Problem is the AI allies do not want to fight. Now most of the time they will fire on an enemy if they see him, but do nto expect them to go looking.\nThis really gets to be a a pain in missions where the ally AI is needed to win, in such cases its a 60/40 chance you are losing the mission\nc. units disappear. You will have a unit walking then all of a sudden its gone. Not shot at or in combat just gone, it's like the rapture\nd. Units movement. You spend a lot of your time trying to get units to move. Now most of the time they will move when ordered, but there are many times they act liek your not even around. I am not talking a unit that is scared or injured but just under normal cases they simply do not want to move.\n2. Line of Sight\nI would love to meet the person who designed this system. It appears combat in WW2 involved both sides playing pick a boo. You will have two units within 10 feet of stopped looking at each other, only to have the enemy disappear, then reappear in the same spot.  I have seen whole tanks be surrounded by enemy units (infantry and tanks) disappear then re appear. This gets to be a pain in missions where you need to prevent the enemy from breaking through. it sucks to be firing at that last tank only to have it engage its cloaking device\nStage design\nFor some reason the developers decided not make the player guess on how to complete missions. Sure you are giving an overview on what you need to do but never told how to do it. I know you are thinking, why do you want the game to walk you through it? That's not what I mean, what I mean is the developers put hidden triggers that only they know in order to complete a mission. For example\nYou are to hold the line and defeat the enemy attack. Ok so you fight for a few minute and even get a "Mission accomplished" alert. Ok good, so some time goes by and your are still playing. Well this is where the fun begins, see the game said you had to defeat teh attack, what it didn't say is that in order to complete the mission you need to have an infantry unit in some random building.\nNow if you are lucky it is just simple case of moving stuff around till you activate the trigger. If you are not so lucky the enemy keeps rescanning until you run out of men.\n\nFinal thought\nNo doubt someone will come on here and claim I am not telling the truth. Well to them I say go look at the official reviews, most complain about the same issues. It is sad this is a great game when it works and could have been something if only the developers had the skills to deliver\nThis game is one of the worse thing to come out on computer. It is clear the publisher is trying to fight against software piracy by creating stuff that is so bad , people would not even want to steal it.","July 21, 2014","false","19.8"," 37 of 99 people (37%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","37","37","99","0","1"

Found out its not a tutorial, couse they explain litarally nothing. Objektive - Go Solider - Find out your self how. And this can take a while. More then ever, u will have to ask your self: is it a bug? or is it an intendet feature? Couse theese units do some weird ♥♥♥♥.\n\nThen u loose your first solider in a 100+ man fight over 4km² with mutible Tanks and Artilliry pices; and the game stops, zooms in to the max lvl and tells u then very unfortunaly this ONE solider had to die. So u think: ok, sad, lets go on. U take your left hand of the arrowbuttons(couse no WASD for what ever reason) and press Space, or a very tiny button on the top of your screen, to countinue. And then the whole thing happens over again.\n\nJea, the game stops at EVERY SILNGE UNIT that is destroyed, or in the case of vehicles, only damaged. So ofc, first thing u do is go to the options menue to disable that. U find out thare is no such option. When u are rly dedicated to playing this game, couse u payed money for it, then u might search in the internet for a solution and find out that u can chage particular setting only in a separate configurations .exe, wich ofc dose not open for u(as for many others 2), so u have to search for the .ini file and do it the oldfashion way. Might not sound much, but that's so incedebly fked up. becouse u will not find a single person, that will keep that feature on intentionally. Mutible forum threads, on multible forums agree with me, that this feature make the game litarally unplayable. just imaginge a 50 man infantry getting hit by 2 arty pices at once. U will have to press space 50 times, without getting any usefull information at all, couse the game zooms in to a lvl, where u got exelent taktiacal overview over the 3m² that your poor solider has died in...\n\nBasicly u HAVE TO chage a .ini file, to make the game EVEN PLAYEBLE. Case closed, your honore.","May 29","false","19.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
