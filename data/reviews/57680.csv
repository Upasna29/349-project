While I probably wouldn't buy this at full price, getting it on sale or in a bundle is a sure thing.\n\nThe graphics are pleasant - not perfect but for the most part I was happy looking around at what the game had to offer. It played a lot like a non-complex Witcher (2). Gameplay was responsive with button combos to swing your sword this way or that or kick or whatever, and there are RPG elements to unlock more combos/abilities/perks. Honestly I was expecting poor gameplay and that was a surprise for me.\n\nThe story is better than many of the reviews are stating, but it's not told in a very effective way. Cheesy lines delivered by soft-spoken NPCs in which you see little. But it's there. It's not Shakespeare in that it's easy to miss if your ears aren't open, but it's a bit harder to pick up is all.\n\nRegardless, story is not needed. It's meant to be played not read or watched (in that if it were a movie or a novel it would suck).\n\nThe individual cells or environments are unique enough and I rather enjoyed snapping between two characters or having the option to play co-op (not that I have any friends). Many people say there are too many co-op games, but I feel a lot of games just ignore co-op even if it would fit perfectly. At least give those of us who like co-op the option, and those who don't like it lose nothing in the process.\n\nAll in all a good experience. A poor man's Witcher 2.","October 18, 2014","true","0.5"," 54 of 60 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","54","60","0","0"

Too bad it's overlooked.\n\nThe graphics are dated, really dated, and you can tell that right away. But somehow, the game itself does not appear to be ugly - the game doesn't try to be anything else but a good and easy linear adventure. But in general, the graphics are STATIC. As in, there's no wind, trees are frozen in time and space, no physics, no discernible effects on the environment by your actions.\n\nThe story is extremely easy to follow though. No need to memorize names, locations and tons of redundant quests. And there's an abundant amount of history to enjoy. I'm not sure how much of it is concrete though.\n\nThere is a certain degree of suspense in some levels and sequences and there is the ability to do some stealth killing.\n\nYou can play as one of the two Templar brothers, and you can switch in between the two any time you want, eventually, another character joins in.\nYou can also gain experience and exchange it for some combo moves, more health, etc.\nYou also get to collect some items that enable you to get one or another armor and weaponry.\n\nLet's not forget about the co-op though. The bad thing is that I'm not sure how much re-playability this game has. So I would rather see this game as a lone experience and have other games that scream co-op to have co-op (Jericho for instance). Your AI co-op partner is okaish for the most part, and your stealth moves are apt to copying your moves, but sometimes your partner with end up on the ground which is when you have to revive him or her.\n\nAlso, it's rare in games when the two protagonists tend to agree with each other most if not all the time. The two characters you play as agree with each other constantly, unlike in Bulletstorm, Enslaved, etc. So even though there's enough scripted dialogue between the two characters, I would probably enjoy to listen to some arguments about the inquisition, the church, the main quest and what not.\n\nThe game is also easy, really easy, but eventually, it does require you to pull off some combos and some well-times blocks and counter-attacks to advance further.\n\nThe voice acting is pretty poor though.\n\nThe game is pretty long. There are puzzles to solve and dungeons to crawl through.  There are plenty of twists and turns along the way.\n\nThe co-op is outstanding. My best friend and I spent 3 days playing the game. A few months later, we started playing the game from scratch.\n\nWhen we first tried running co-op we had difficulty seeing each other, so I e-mailed the dev at the end of 2012 to figure out what's up. They e-mailed back a few days later saying that they were out of the office because of X-mas (they also wished me happy X-Mas), and then asked that we stay put for a couple of days so that they could e-mail us back the activation e-mail (which you unfortunately need to play online), so they did so a few days later.\n\nIn any case, I would recommend this game to anyone who wants to relax, who likes the hack'n'slash with tactical approach and anyone who wants enjoy a nice story.\n\nPlus, you get to support a small company that made the game in the first place.","November 27, 2013","true","17.9"," 57 of 69 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","57","69","0","0"

The enjoyable combat and decent story help to overcome the game's pedestrian production values, and make it worth checking out.\n\nIn The First Templar you and a partner (controlled either by another player or pretty good AI) are on a quest for the Holy Grail. While your goals are noble other characters may not be as trustworthy as they seem, and there are a few plot twists and surprise revelations along the way.\n\nMuch of your time in The First Templar will be spent in combat and the fighting system is good; there's a nice rhythm to it, and a wide variety of moves can be unlocked, which keeps things from getting stale.\n\nWhen you're not fighting, you're figuring out puzzles, negotiating deadly traps, and searching for collectibles. There are even a few stealth sequences in The First Templar, and they're pulled off decently enough. Thankfully the AI of your partner is quite good, and they can easily negotiate the levels and handle themselves in combat without you having to babysit them.\n\nThe Special Edition of The First Templar on Steam contains a bonus mission that takes place after the events of the main game. This mission takes about 90 minutes to complete, and it has a few new Steam achievements to go along with it. All told it will take about 12 - 14 hours to complete the game, depending on how thorough you are when it comes to looking for hidden areas and collectibles.\n\nThe First Templar is underrated.","November 27, 2013","true","18.2"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","23","28","0","0"

Nobody has heard about this and i got mine from a bundle. Gave it a try and was not dissapointed.\n\nGraphics are old and characters blocky but that does not stop you from having a pretty decent time with this title. Greatest strengths this title has is the Templar story setting which isn't very unique but when it's well made it has all the components you need for a good cloak and dagger story. I found the story arc and level design to be quite decent.\n\nCombat is based on using combos and special moves. Silent takedowns can be used on enemies from behind. I suppose combat system could be described as a loose precursor to the popular batman games.\n\nOnly real cons i could find are the aging looks and stretched ending. It's like the makers of this game just did not want the ride to end when it would have been most appropriate.\n\nGamepad recommended.","October 6, 2015","true","16.9"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","18","21","0","0"

You are guided through a linear story with optional "side objectives" which amount to  straying off path for a minute to fight a band of enemies, open a chest, or read a tablet.\n\nFirst let's note one thing. YOU DON'T NEED FACEBOOK TO PLAY WITH A FRIEND. EVERY REVIEW THAT SAYS SO IS LYING. I PLAYED WITH MY FRIEND WITHOUT FACEBOOK. IT IS AS SIMPLE AS JOINING ON YOUR FRIEND THROUGH YOUR FRIENDS LIST.\n\n+The game doesn't look to bad, but then again I'm not picky.\n+A decent amount of collectible costumes for each of your 3 playable characters.\n+The music is pretty good, but it wasn't anything to brag about.\n+The combat is good and you have plenty of combos/moves to keep you entertained for a while.\n+Skill development is extensive with 4 trees of development for each character.\n+Co-op makes the game a lot more fun to play.\n-The sounds in this game are mediocre, no real effort was put into any kind of immersion.\n-Character models are ridiculous. Main character's head isn't even attached to his body. Your female companion's neck becomes distorted when she turns to look at you in certain scenes. When they speak their mouths move like puppets.\n-The animations are limited and lacking. Every character has the same boring running animation that you get to stare at throughout the entire game.\n-The story was uninteresting at best and constantly interrupted by annoying villagers asking for your help. Making 3 out of every 4 levels completely unrelated to the story and mere filler to the story.\n-The game is too long for how uninteresting it is. By the end you'll be begging for it to be over.\n-The game as a choice system which was UNFORTUNATELY only used at the very end of the game. It should have been used throughout the entire game to keep me interested, or at least used better in the end so that my ending and the ending I didn't choose isn't simply one line of dialogue different.\n-The voice acting is lifeless, emotionless, and halfway through the game I began to ignore it\n-The dialogue is pathetically written. The lines are either blande, forced jokes that suck, or forced lines that are supposed to be the character's "catchphrase" almost that just becomes annoying to hear when they repeat it 4 times per level. IE: "It's a girl thing."\n-The character development was horrible. I already forgot most of their names. What's Roland's past? What was my female companions past? How come by 4 hours into the game all I know about my main character is, "There was an accident. I don't remember anything. I don't talk about it." And why don't I learn anything else about him until 8 hours into the game? I'm able to predict character development long before it is ever done.\n\nI'll give this a 4/10 simply because it entertained me for at least half of its playtime. But for the last 4 hours I found myself playing it just so I could finish it. It's not worth your money. Though in a bundle like I did, it's ok for some co-op entertainment. Until you get bored of it halfway through like my friend and I did.

If you're a fan of the genre, worth picking up when on sale. Co-op is an added bonus.\n\nThe story itself is pleasantly uncomplicated. I didn't even bother much with it. What's that? We're a knight in search of the Holy Grail? Whatever. Let's get our swords out and start slashing. The voice acting is generally good, but nothing outstanding. The atmosphere is great, though; the desert fortress of Acre is bright and dusty, while the village and swamps at the base of Montsegur castle are drab and dark. Environments in general are nicely detailed - not earth-shattering, but nice. You'll come across some incredibly low-res rocks and water at odd places in the game (usually towards the end). Fire and smoke are particularly well-rendered. This is not an open world btw; travel too far one way or another, and you'll come up against an invisible wall.\n\nThe combat is very quick to learn, and the upgrade tree is very deep. There is some stealth (very easy), some boss battles (hard, but not too hard), Switching from one character to another is simple and seamless: just hit the Tab key to change to the other character. And you will need to do this to solve some of the dungeon puzzles. The puzzles themselves aren't that hard to complete, though if you charge in without analyzing the situation first, you'll die quickly.\n\nThat's the problem with The First Templar: there's nothing really outstanding about it, but it is not a bad game either. It is average in just about every quantifiable category. I had fun with it. Not a must-buy at the current list price of $20; at $6 or less, though, it's a fun game to while away a few hours.\n\nIf you're purchasing for the co-op, only the hosting player gets achievements, so be sure to take turns hosting the game.","May 24, 2014","true","20.0"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","15","21","0","0"

It's a decent game to go through at least once and is definitely worth picking up.It's hard to judge The First Templar by the usual standards, since almost everything here has two sides. Fairly good story, but dated graphics. Interesting combat system – annoying stealth sequences. Big levels – linear corridors. But ultimately, you will be remembering these 10+ hours of non-stop swashbuckling with a smile on your face.The sneak mechanic is fun, as it's always fun to visit death upon unsuspecting enemies, but it is admittedly a little broken. Enemy line of vision is poorly handled, to say the least.Combat can unfortunately be a little repetitious, with the basic attacks mapped on two buttons and a few mapped to others. This leaves a very strong impression of the game being a button masher which it tries to rectify by giving the characters special attacks they can perform to break up the gameplay. Sadly though, some of the moves aren't the most responsive.Each level has main objectives for you to complete as well as additional, bonus objectives that serve to give you more experience for your characters. They also contain a variety of collectibles in the form of chests and tablets. The chests contain various items, ranging from experience to new outfits for the characters.The story of the game is actually quite interesting, with the characters trying to figure out where to find the Grail amidst the mystery of what is happening with the King betraying the Templar order. All in all, this is a fairly decent game. Overall 7/10.","August 5, 2014","true","83.7"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

Graphics could definitely be better, but they still fit in quite well and do not ruin your experience.\n\nStory: 78 / 100\nIt is true that the story feels slightly unchanging. For most parts of the game you are infiltrating castles or camps, but the story itself does keep you interested and hungry for more. Furthermore, aside of the storyline of the game, it offers you the story of the knight Templars in small portions that you get by discovering stone tablets. I have enjoyed this addition very much as it brings the age of Templars alive and closer to you.\n\nCombat mechanics: 76 / 100\nAs everything else in the game, combat is developed to that point where you just begin to like it. Trick with the combat module in this game is that there are 3 characters that you may chose to control at any time during the game, and all 3 of them have different skill trees that come with different attacks. As you progress through the game, you may chose to upgrade your attack moves and unlock new ones. Game also offers huge difficulty spikes between the difficulty modes which is great in my opinion. This allows you to chose whether you would like to go through the game without much stress or perhaps chose a more realistic mode. Sometimes you also get awarded with a kill cam. I enjoyed it.\n\nFun factor: 79 / 100\n\nIs the game worth its price (14eur)? I am not sure, it depends what you are looking for.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Drakevarg/recommended/57680/","Drakevarg","Drakevarg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Drakevarg/","94 products in account","The First Templar starts off fairly weak: a brief voiceover describing the Knights Templar and the central protagonist Celian's obsession with finding the Holy Grail, before cutting to him and his fellow knight Roland finding a murder scene at a small church, cutting between observations like half the pages had fallen out of the script. However, after this shakey opening the game picks up speed fairly quickly.\n\nMy first impression of the game was that it was similar to Viking: Battle for Asgard; an inoffensively average hack n' slasher with a few stealth elements. And while this assessment isn't entirely inaccurate, the longer I played the more I got NWN2 vibes from it. It's not really an RPG - your equipment is purely aesthetic and by endgame you can afford to fill basically your entire skill tree, and the only choice you're allowed to make is literally the last thing you do in the entire game - but it's very much the same sort of feel of incredibly proficient killers wandering into incident after incident while trudging in the general direction of their actual goal.\n\nThe player characters, while rather simple, get a bit endearing after a while, bantering constantly while navigating terrain and trap, but besides them there are precisely three other characters that get any level of characterization to them besides plot device to move the story forward. Celian himself is unfortunately a bit bland, a generic grizzled badass whose only apparent character traits are an almost crippling hero complex and a mild phobia of rats (which comes up precisely twice and never has any affect on story or game). Even so, his unabashed good-guy nature had some charm to it, making the game feel like a magic-free DnD campaign where you play as a paladin.\n\nOne thing that helps distinguish it from Viking: BfA is that the stealth mechanics actually work - sort of. When you're detected things switch into action mode instantly, giving no margin for error. Thankfully the minimap lets you know precisely where the enemy's sightline is and your support character is handy for quickly dispatching guards in pairs, making winding through an enemy camp with a series of neck snaps feel like a cooly effecient guerilla mission.\n\nThe combat itself is also nicely varied, with enough different ways to punch people's faces in that I was still experimenting with it by game's end, but with a small enough menu that you weren't left simply forgetting half the controls. My only real complains are that the combo attacks can be finnicky at best, often resulting in me shield-bashing an opponent I had been trying to bowl over, and that especially in late game enemy health becomes ridiculously high, with fat, shirtless torturers somehow able to tank half a dozen heavy sword blows to the chest. The fact that you never gain any upgrades to your basic damage output doesn't help.\n\nAll in all, I recommend trying it out if you like fun little hack-n'-slash games that aren't worried about being especially ambitious. However, I will leave one further criticism without explanation. You'll understand if you play through it.\n\n♥♥♥♥ bear traps.","November 18, 2014","true","14.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Those reviews do point out problems that this game has, but at the same time most write that the game is enjoyable.\n\nIf you are a fan of historical RPG, and are willing to overlook some technical flaws, you will enjoy this game.\n\nFirst off, I just finished my first playthrough of the game. It took me 20-something hours. Here are my impressions:\n\nWorst problem:\n\ncharacter animations. They feel unfinished. Most characters walk around stiff, as if they are only held upright due to some painful shaft stuck up... I was surprised to see the finishing credits showing a team of 5 character animators. They really dropped the ball on this one. However the combat finishing move animations are very satisfying to watch.\n\nGood points:\n\nThe story is great. People who say otherwise either haven't progressed enoug in the storyline to where it becomes engrossing, or else they simply don't appreciate the scenario (and why buy the game if you don't?)\n\nCombat is simple but fun. There is no level system, but fighting earns you XP which you use to purchase and upgrade skills. I never really had to rely on any of the combat skills until the final battle though. I played on normal difficulty.\n\nI loved the voice acting. Again, some people wrote otherwise. The voice acting of the main character is simply awesome. To each his own, I suppose. I can only thing that some folks can't appreciate what was done here.\n\nThe traps in this game will ♥♥♥♥ you off (maybe in a good way). They are challenging, and will likely have you cursing out loud.\n\nLastly, the game supports local co-op (split screen). Which is quite rare for PC games. There is also online co-op apparently (I did not try that).\n\nMy bottom line: if you look at this game and think, "hmm, I might enjoy this" then you probabbly will enjoy this game. Don't let yourself miss out on a fun time due to some over-critical reviews.\n","May 24, 2014","true","24.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Probably depends where you read about it. It's thought to have divine powers like eternal youth. Only handful of people manage to get their hands on it but they always lost it. One such a person is Indiana Jones. The other is the main characters here Celian d'Arestide. It's not a spoiler. Right in the beginnig the narrator is saying it. This is the First Templar - highly underrated, that in my opinion came in the wrong time. The problems the game have are probably related due the fact it's port and not a great one. And also some weird decisions.\n\nThe game is released in 2011 and I think even for the time it wasn't that good looking. It have a lot of video option and it runs fine on Windows 7 with 60 fps, but no matter how high you put all settings, it won't impressed you. Characters and textures looks plastic. If I  didn't know the released date, i'd probably say it came out around 2005. Graphics are not bad, just okay.\n\nYou play (mainly) Celian d'Arestide, a knight templar who devoted his life in searching of the Holy Grail. With him is his brother in arms Roland, another templar. One minor spoiler ahead. After about an hour into the game, Roland is replaced with Marie d'Ibelin and with her they travel the world in search for the Grail. Parallel to your quest, you will save a lot of people, even help a city to fight off an attack. Part of the game takes place in time of persecution of the Templars  The story is okay. It have few twists, but it's not the best story ever written in a video game, but it's enjoyble. It connects the dots.\n\nWhat is more enjoyble is the combat. You can play with mouse and keyboard or controller. The game doesn't support generic controller, but I used one and to see how I done it, see the link I provided. If you played Batman Arkham series, you will feel almost like home. The game have similar rhytmic combat, but it have few twist that I like. Make no mistake Batman Arkham series combat is more fluid. The production values are a lot higher. The small difference here is blocking and counterattack. When enemy is about to make a move, icon above his head appear. Then if you don't want to dodge-roll, you have to face him to do counter or block. You can't just spam the buttons and hope to do what is supose to do, when your back is against the enemy. For perfect block and counterattack you have to press the corresponding button at the right time. I like that, because it offers more tension in the combat, especially when you are surrounded. At first is counterintuitive, but I got used to it fast.\n\nThe gameplay is great .You have only one basic combo in the beginnig, but you can buy new ones from the skill menu. In game they are called Special attacks. All are important. They are not many. This is not a spectacle fighter. After each battle you will be rewarded with xp points. With them you can upgrade existing combos or buy new. Special attacks are really important, because enemies tend to block your regular moves and with them you can brake their defense. Of course they are not only for that. The combat in the game is satisfying and almost perfect. I think it needs little more audio and visual feedback to feel more meaty. There is one perticular thing I like in the combat – the finishing moves. When a single enemy is left there is a chance to trigger one. They are nice little touch and I never got tired of seeing them\n\nOther things you can buy from the skill menu is additional Health and Zeal orbs and they way you restore them. Health orbs are basically another health bar. More you have, longer you'll live. Life is restore by eating or drinking water. They fill even your Health orbs.\n\nSpecial attacks and other moves require Zeal orbs. They are replenish by fighting, but with upgrades you do it even by killing enemies. As I said blocking is essential for surviving, because there is upgrade for getting Zeal orbs by blocking at the right time and therefore you can make Special attacks and so on. It's full circle.\n\nThe game can be played in split screen or online. I didn't try them, but I can safely say, your AI parter is quite capable of dealing with enemies. This is such a suprise. He or she have their skill menu and you have to buy for them upgrades. To my hugh suprise the AI  uses Special attacks and even replenish his life! First I thought, that they will never use any of the moves I buy for them, but they do and this help a lot. You also have few basic commands for your teammate. I've never ever seen before better AI partner. Well, you will do most of the killing and of course the AI will do stupid things, it's not perfect, but still I stay behind my words.\n\nA small part of the gameplay is stealth. With one or two exeptions, it's not forced, but it's useful dealing with multiple enemies. It's kinda cluncky, because it just duck or hide behind a cover and wait for opportunity to snap a neck. Even when you are out in the open, the enemy won't notice you as long you crouch an stay out of sight. The focus of the game is action not stealth, but it's still this part could be better. Most of the levels are not design with stealth in mind.\n\nLevel design is okay. You will visit a giant mansion, an oasis in a desert, the Middle East, Asia, dungeons filled with traps, castles, abbey, villige and so on. They are all nice, but it's too bad you can't explore more of them. I really love the places full of traps. It feels like i'm Indiana Jones. Levels are linear, but exploration is rewarded. There are hidden chest with parts for new clothes or weapons, xp or buffs and other stuff to find. Clothes and weapons don't offer any additional bonuses, so it's not require to equip them. They are just cosmetics.\n\nEnemies you encounter are more or less the same with few exeptions. Different types of soldiers, bandits with swords, axes, spears and so on. In one level you will encounter hashashins, that are using daggers and jump a lot. In other places you will fight a tall ogre-looking creatures, but the main character said that they are humans. This is not fantasy game. As a setting is more realistic. Enemy AI won't surprise you if you played similar game to Batman Arkham series. They surround you and waiting to beat them, and from time to time they make regular or special attack. All the bosses here are fun. They make tons of damage and if you are not using all acquired skills and the shield, you will die easily.\n\nSound design is okay at best. Voice acting is passable. Most main characters voices are decent, but side characters and NPC's are bad. It's not awful as a whole, but it could be better. Celian have a gruff voice of course.\n\nEffects are also okay. As a mention in the beginning the game could use better audio feedback, when you slice enemy. There is one really weird thing here. Sometimes when enemy dies wilhelm scream can be heard. Why? I don't see the point. It tooks me out of immersion, especially when I killed the final boss. It's out of place.\n\nMusic is not really memorable. Most places have different theme, but a lot of times when fight arose, you will here the same track over and over again.","December 25, 2015","true","20.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It's easily the longest and most drawn out game I've ever played. ~12 hours later and we beat it, and towards the end we were just pushing on to end it so we could remove it from our HDs.\n\nThe story is kind of interesting if a bit cliche at first, a knight's epic search for the Holy Grail; though to give the game credit they do throw a curveball at you later on for which the game gathers it's namesake. The environments are fairly nifty, especially during the part where you have to navigate these sort of trials to get to where the Grail is. Reminded me of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, minus the fun, entertaining, and enjoyment part.\n\nVoice acting is atrocious. The characters are about as deep as the drool puddle you'll likely form from boredom: the interaction between Celian(the main Templar character) and Marie(I don't even really know her role or why she followed you other than she did) is literally her asking a question, sometimes incredulously("We're really going to fight that entire army!?), to him answering it with a one liner in his dull, dead and flat tone("Yes..."). Though this game doesn't feature much in the way of artwork, one thing that incessantly bothered me was the character potraits in the bottom left and right. The Templar's picture is actually something resembling artwork...the female co-op partner's picture looks like they just took a snapshot of her model and pasted it there. It's hugely out of place and inconsistent.\n\nI would only ever really suggest this if you're a BIG hack and slash adventure game fan. Even then there are plenty other better alternatives on the market. The only positive I can give this game is tons of collectibles leading to lore or outfits(reskins), and a VERY lengthy campaign.","May 27, 2014","false","12.0"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

I believe most of my frustrations about this game have already been covered by older reviews, but I'm still gonna rant about it for the heck of it anyway. First off, the graphics leave a lot of room for improvements, nothing special, generic and plain, although at times it can look kinda pretty, hit and miss mostly. Characters look funny, though this can be a matter of opinion, and they move in an awkward manner as if someone glued a giant board to their backs. As an avid fan of open world game, this game dissuaded me from playing due to its linear gameplay, you don’t have the luxury of going wherever the heck you want.  Combat is forgettable and unimpressive.\nThough I can tolerate some of the stated flaws, my main beef with the game is the control. REVERSE MOUSE CONTROL. And the game doesn’t even have an option to change that. “Oh, you’d like to see where you’re going? How about we show you the ceiling instead? Isn’t the sky just lovely today?” Simply put, you point up, the screen goes down and vice versa. I was struggling with it and it felt like most of my effort in playing this game went into maintaining a proper field of view. On a side note, when I finally got somewhat used to the stupid control, I went back to playing other games with NORMAL mouse control and it all went bananas for me as once again I had to struggle to revert to how I used to play those game before I had to adapt to the clunky control of this game.\nCan’t say anything about the plot because I haven’t gotten very far in as evidenced by my playing time and because everything about this game just discourages me completely. My advice, don’t waste your money on it even on a sale, and if you’ve made the mistake that I did? Don’t repeat my mistake of wasting time with it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/recommended/57680/","fandango89","Apparently Kid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fandango89/","599 products in account","Wish I could recommend this but there are too many problems. First off, the combat. You basically mash the one attack because you can only use other buttons for special abilities when you've built up enough zeal so it gets super repetitive fast. You only use the same weapon throughout the entire game without upgrading it. As for leveling up. Although you can upgrade traits it is mostly just "more health/zeal/damage" or a few different special attacks, but they all require zeal, which is stupid because then you will just be using one of the attacks so you're basically replacing the attacks you just leveled up, but never changing your basic boring attack which becomes not as effective. In combat that are problems. They throw you into combat fighting groups of 6 guys that just attack you from behind while you try to attack someone else. And to make this worse, blocking wont turn you to block the guy attacking you, meaning if you're attacking some guy and stop and try to block the person attacking from behind you'll still get hit, which is dumb. Enemies can for some reason be in the middle of getting hit by your sword combo and just start attacking you, making you trying to do combos useless. You would think there is a pattern, but you have no idea when they'll do it making you just want to attack once at a time. Also there is only 1 way to break shields and they always can and will attack you when you are forced to do it. Enemies can hit you even when out of range and hitboxes on enemies sometimes aren't right. The levels get boring as its the same thing of you running into groups of 5 guys of the same enemy types and pressing the single attack button to hurt them. There are also some very poorly designed checkpoints that force you through multiple annoying parts again. Also, healing in combat is stupid. They give you healing objects but you have to stand next to them and interact and it takes 3 seconds of uninterrupted standing to get health, making them useless when you actually need them, in combat, as someone will attack you. Very dumb design decision. There are secrets to find but they are also poorly done. Markers show you where to go which is nice and sometimes you have to follow footsteps which I enjoyed, but there is no actual maps and sometimes you can miss secrets because you see the direction of where it is but can't find how to get there and there isn't a map to check. Also, some secrets unlock new costumes and different looking weapons (without stat changes), but this is poorly done also. They are broken up into parts of course scattered across levels. Which means in order to get a new sword you need to find 3-4 boxes in different levels, meaning you need to get every secret or get lucky that the ones you find are them or you've just wasted time. That means you could have done the hard work to find 3 boxes of the costume but since you missed that one box in a certain corner of the level you now don't get it........very stupid. The game is very long and the story is actually interesting. Graphics are also fine, although voice acting is terrible as well as face animation/movements and body movements. During conversation faces dont move and people make stupid gestures with their bodies. 5/10.","December 25, 2014","false","31.9"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Character models are a little dated, but considering this is a few years old thats to be expected.\n\nCombat isnt overly special, just button mash to win, but I had fun during the boss fights and found smashing guards to be pretty relaxing as the game went. Stealth was pretty fun. Sneak up behind guards and snap their necks, which was a great way to break up any boredom in guard-smashing.\n\nLinear, but I dont really see that as an entirely bad thing considering the lack of map. Also felt like it helped the story keep its pace, especially in the later levels.\n\nThere are chests to keep an eye out for, as well as to explore the rooms/areas that arent on the linear path. The chests are buffs for that level like extra health, extra zeal, extra abilities, or costumes. Collect all the costume pieces and you can unlock different costumes for the main character and both party members.\n\nPuzzles werent anything special. I cringed the first time it made me try to use both characters to solve a puzzle, until I realized how player-friendly the party member controls are when it comes to puzzles. Tell a member to stop following you, and even if you swap the character you are playing as, the other stays put. Park them near a level, and an extra option will pop up letting you tell them to pull a lever without swapping to them.\n\nOverall, Id recommend it if you like story-driven games and dont mind some hacknslash when it comes to combat.","July 7, 2015","true","19.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It has been compared to Assassins Creed, and Dragon Age, but lacks any of the fun and ingenuity those games had.\n\nThe voice acting and writing are atrocious, and sitting through the painful dialogue is truly the game's most difficult aspect. 90% of the conversations between the two protagonist characters follow the formula of the secondary character saying "Oh no! Do we really plan on *insert current mission objective here* all by ourselves?", and the main character responding with "Yes" or some other mumbled one-to-three word affirmation.\n\nThe game-play itself is incredibly simplistic, and requires the player to mash the mouse1 button to build up enough "zeal" before any of the advertised "furious combos" can be utilized. The enemy AI isn't challenging at all, with the difficulty coming from the player's attacks themselves. The AI is programmed to cheese the players at every opportunity, knocking them down or poking them with their sword while they are mid-combo or already knocked down. This results in multiple instances of player knockdown spam, where your only escape is to roll away at the speed sound; like a cellophane-wrapped child just set on fire.\n\nEven with these flaws the game has some fun moments. For example, there are about 5 levels where your only objective is to navigate trap-filled tombs a-la "Indiana Jones and the First Templar of Doom". The problem is that these sequences are tiny gems in the otherwise massive and tedious narrative of the main story. Most levels have you slaying hordes or identical twin enemies with identical abilities every five feet, so the entire level feels like one continuous and draining spam fest.\n\nThe 1 on 1 dueling segments are fun, but they really just serve to highlight the combat system's major flaws. Boss enemies will either spam unblock-able attacks, use their magnetic vacuum swords to suck you into their attack animations, or simply ignore being stabbed in the face and attack you mid-way through your own animations. Luckily for the players, healing items are scattered every 5 feet, so there's really no way for you to die.\n\nI can honestly say after playing this game from start to finished, both my Co-Op partner and I were desperate for the game to end 15 levels in. Little did we know, the game actually has a total of 20 different levels. Even when you reach the end of the story, there is little to no resolution, so you feel like your actions during the last 4-5 levels we're completely pointless and had no effect on anything.\n\nTo be honest, I could forgive all of the game's flaws if not for the terrible level design. Each level is comprised of large areas with hidden chests and side quests. Unfortunately, your character moves (hilariously) at a snails pace, making navigating the levels a bore. On top of that, the level designers insisted on placing random and elaborate nooks and crannies that lead to absolutely nowhere. I cannot relate to you how many times I was searching for treasure chests around the map, found a promising path and thought "Oh I found a secret!", followed it to the end, and found naught but a bush or rock as my reward.\n\nDespite its many flaws, this game is truly a laugh riot and should be played by anyone attempting to get into video game design, if only to experience the overall horrid design decisions and hilarious bugs that plague the entire experience.\n\n2/10 Never Again, Tropico.\n\n**EDIT** Oh and I just remembered, one of the two main villain's fate (and the female character's entire reason for being part of the adventure) is never explored, he simply just walks away and is never mentioned again.","May 27, 2014","false","9.9"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","10","21","0","0"

I can say for sure that this game is really addicting for some reason. First time i played it, i thought i was wasting my time with this game (i got this game from a bundle and tried to give a go), because it looked kinda bad in the beginning and the voice acting made me laugh. But when you focus on the story, you will completely ignore the bad things about this game and play the hell out of it. I really loved that you could do bonus objectives and find loot, because i dig these kind of things in games. Using stealth hasn´t been this much fun also - you can easly kill anyone that is in your way or just break the game hiding in the bushes, while the game sends a group of men against you and you can just sneak away. The puzzles were sometimes kinda lame and annoying, but theres more killing than puzzle solving in the game. Haven´t tried the multiplayer, so can´t say nothing about it. So overall, i would give this game a solid 8 out of 10, because i haven´t had an enjoyment of a game this big in a while. I would strongly advise to get this game when its cheap OR if you have the balls and money, you could get this game for full price.","August 12, 2014","true","15.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The story seems pretty decent so far heavy christian based sub-story but that should be expected from anything "Knight Templar" based. Combat is simple fun finishers but game could have seriously used more gore lol I mean finisher acts like going to decapitate an enemy and he just falls over ya know? Best gore you see is the blood on your sword so pretty simple gore. has co-op never tried it probably wont but i belive it would be fun. No character levels in the game but plenty of active and passive skills to hone exp is the cost of skills rather than say skill points per level. No open world you go the way that was programmed for you to go. No buying armor or weapons no customization what so ever any armor or weapons you get you find either as rewards or chests all outfits are pre-made. Stealth could have been better but it works for this game i suppose.

There are stealth levels, combat levels, and puzzle levels (and occasionally a mix).  There are weapons and outfits to collect, but they're just cosmetic so you don't fall behind if you miss one.  There are a lot of skills to pick up, with multiple choices at any given time.  The story is engaging and there are several twists near the end, but those twists don't come out of nowhere - they make perfect sense in the story.  The AI for your companion is pretty decent, although not as effective as a good player.\n\nOn the other hand, the checkpoint system is kindof annoying and the plot is very linear (except for one choice you can make at the very end of the game).  Overall, the pros outweigh the cons, though.","August 17, 2014","true","18.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The graphics shouldn’t make or break a game, but it’s definitely in its favour if they look rather good. This game does not look good at all. It’s outdated, looks pretty darn ugly, and to top it off, the animations are rather shocking to say the least. Let me explain: When your character turns from one direction to the other, it should be smooth and look pretty good. What it shouldn’t be doing is snapping from one direction and then to the other instantly. There’s not really any in-between animation and you’re just sort of snapping from one direction to the other, and it just does not look good.\n\nNow, let’s get into the real meat of the game, or what should be the meat of the game, and that’s the gameplay. For a hack and slash game you want some nice, satisfying combat to make you feel like the true badass that you’re playing as, slicing up enemies left, right, and centre. This game does not feel like that at all. The combat feels light and is just kind of boring, it’s nothing too interesting and I’m sure in co-op you’re only going to get the chance to tell your buddy the same thing. The game also takes a crack at stealth, and goes for what most games do with stealth, which is as long as the enemy doesn’t see you; you can sneak up on them and crack their neck. Speaking of cracking necks, this games breaking neck animation is kind of ridiculously fast, and the sound effect they use for it is so short and sudden it just takes away even more from the experience.\n\nThe story is rather dull and uninteresting, and left me doing the one thing I rarely do in games and that’s skip the cutscenes, because the way it’s all being told just can’t grab my attention, so I’m not even going to waste my time when it comes to the story.\n\nLastly would be the audio, and more importantly, the music. The sound effects are okay, nothing special and not particularly good, but they serve their purpose. The music in this game is just another one of those things I don’t take too much notice with. The music hasn’t drawn me in at all, and certainly isn’t something I’d necessarily want to listen to again. Also, on a slight sidenote, there was a moment in the game where I was simply walking in a monastery, and there was literally no sound to speak of. It was utterly silent, no footsteps, and no music, it was just completely silent. A little bit of music would have been nice, but alas, there was nothing.\n\nAll in all, this is definitely not a game I recommend. I haven’t enjoyed my time with it, the audio is just okay, the gameplay is plain and nothing special, and the story is just uninteresting. Not a game I would recommend spending your money on. There a many other games that are more enjoyable and more worth your time, and money!\n","October 16, 2014","false","2.0"," 12 of 35 people (34%) found this review helpful","34","12","35","0","0"

And let me tell you, it WORKS.\n\nThe highlight, in my opinion, is the co-operative play.  Every ounce of the game appears to have been designed to maximise the potential for teamwork.  In other words, co-operation isn't just a buzzword or an afterthought.  It is integral to the gaming experience.\n\nOf course you may still play in single-player, and the game is very good even then, but I found the story so interesting and the drama so involving that I appreciated being able to share the experience with a friend.\n\nPlease note, I havn't played all the way through the campaign yet.  (It's a lengthy quest and you'll get your money's worth.)  Judging from the collectables I've gathered (gear and diary entries and so on), I surmise that my buddy and I are probably about three-quarters through the game.  Already I don't want it to end;  but all good things do.\n\nGRAPHICS -- 90 %\n\nThe game looks glorious.  Just look at those textures!  Just look at that animation!  Even better is that it runs fast and smooth regardless of the amount of enemies, the size of the level or the amount of visual effects on-screen.  Just brilliant!\n\nSOUND -- 85%\n\nFrom the voice casting to the voice acting to the musical score to the sound effects everything is very well done.\n\nEXECUTION -- 95 %\n\nHere we come back to the game's core concept and how well it has been realised.  You feel like you're traversing strange lands.  You feel like you're on a quest of importance.  And the story plays out well, with a plethora of interesting revelations as things develop.\n\nADDICTIVENESS -- 95 %\n\nMassively addictive.  I can't wait to see which location or fantastic revelation is lurking around the next corner.\n\nOVERALL -- 92 %\n\nA truly fantastic co-operative experience.  Single-player is still good but it's the co-op where this game shines.  And it does shine.","May 14, 2014","true","16.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Full of action and plot twists, there's no break from combat in this game. Added kill moves and a very small selection of skills add a sense of tactics to the game rather than just click to kill. Combat is entirely controlled by the player, blocking, moving, and when to strike. Overll, the combat is relatively easy as long as you have good timing and know when to block or dodge since there is no cooldown buffer meaning you can block or move mid-swing.\n\nThe storyline is rather straight-lined but that does not mean it is a bad thing. The storyline gives another spin to the legend of the Holy Grail and to where it is being kept.\n\nAll in all, it is a rather fun play for a 10 hour game and I would suggest this game to any gamer who is interested in role-playing or adventure games.","June 14, 2011","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And it's funny! There are the templars and here they are well represented. The game focuses upon the historical reproduction of the epoc and you will find here a lot of original tables with rules and letters of the past.\n\nThis means that you have to forgot magic, skeletons and other stuff, this is a game that wants to recreate the scenario of the ancient and it reaches in my opinion enough well. Graphics is detailed and clear, armor expecially are good, with bump mapping and reflection of the iron. Of course this is a budget game, and a lot of details that you find in colossus like skyrim and Co. are missing. The gameplay is focused on a single working trama that will discover the secret of the Templars, the use of the Inquisition as an army and will let you understand as a first protagonist how man race reaches it's worst during time.\n\nA part this, you will play an amusing action game with "corridors" level but some secrets here and there, with various scenario that reaches sometimes incredible skyline. I've get fun doing a lot of screenshots and they are really good. You will fight always with a companion that will help you expecially in your morale. You will never feel lost or abandoned because he/she will always be there! strange...\n\nGameplay is alternate between action, exploring, tracking footsteps, or levels of traps and chests; there is also a stealth mode. Everything I must say, is very simplified, but is a good balance and it'is fun! Moreover you will gain experience to level up both your characters, but you will master the art of combat not so quickly because it's not simple to understand how to engage in the most proficient manner.\n\nThe game is long? Yes! it is, I've taken about 16 hours to complete ... just remember to get fun from everything, looking scenario, reading tablets of original manuscripts of the epoc, and so on..\n\nThis is a very good budget game, too high for budget and too low for colossus production... a midle budget funny game!\nPlay it if you want some distraction between a shooter and an Rpg.\n\nLord Hol Napult's experience: 7/10","November 22, 2014","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are light/charge/secondary attacks as well as melee special abilities (crowd control and single-target options). Though there's nothing revolutionary here, there's also nothing bad. If you've got a friend and want a solid multiplayer RPG (light on the story), this is a great find for a few bucks.","November 22, 2014","true","17.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can play in 1080p and it doesn't look as bad as many say. The fighting is not as simple as some of the reviewers say either, once you start upgrading there are lots of special moves that you can do, even with the keyboard and mouse as your controller.\n\nYes the game is linear but often there are treasures and bonuses to be found when you take a small detour from the path.\n\nThe game has interesting information on the Knights Templar, most of it seems historically correct.\n\nThe first level is really bland but after that it only improves, the second of the 20th levels is a forest not unlike the Forest Near Flotsham in The Witcher 2, I really liked that.\n\nIt's not all fighting either, there are footsteps to be followed, doors to be opened, secrets to be found.\n\nYou have an AI or second player as your companion, I didn't try the second player but played with the AI and was pleasantly surprised by how good the AI player was handling himself/herself in the fights.\n\nI really enjoyed my run of 20 hours in this game and highly recommend it! You just have to get past the blandness of the first level...\n\nOne point of criticism though, having to create an account for Kalypso to spam me on really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off. I ended up using a fake mailinator account and that worked but still they should respect their paying customers more!","May 26, 2015","true","23.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Kalypso has brought us some decent strategy games but this is an action game that seems to have the graphics and animations of a strategy game and that would seem okay but in this case, it just looks downright awful. This game is better than Cursed Crusade but that doesn't make this a good game. Another thing is that this game is not Teen, it is a few decals shy of an M rating, and I'm okay with this. It's the gameplay, the voice acting, and the stiff animations combining with sudden jumpy movements characters seem to have. It just doesn't work together to make a cohesive action experience. If you want a game about Templars and Crusaders, just stick to Assassin's Creed because while this game can entertain, it truly begins to grate on you like you are parmesan cheese over a bowl of pasta.\n\nPROS: Some decent gameplay, finishers are cool, lots of violence for a Teen rating, skill trees have a lot of room to make the characters suit your playstyle.\n\nCONS: Not a single interesting character, animations are janky, voice acting is atrocious, graphics are poor, hair looks like cement/clay, no physics in this game at all.

The game is broken into chapters and each chapter has optional side objectives, makes the levels more interesting than just plowing through with the main objectives.\n\nI imagine some people are disappointed they can't play as Roland, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sword weilding fighting companion, more, or that he doesn't have more screen time. The other companion the double dagger weilding woman is the only character with range who can throw daggers. The main character shield and long sword who can charge into enemies shield first, regain life for the players is a solid character. Weapon and custome skins are a nice touch that doesn't do anything for game play but something small that adds interest.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/frontman12/recommended/57680/","frontman12","hitt.william","http://steamcommunity.com/id/frontman12/","166 products in account","Very cautious recommendation here. If you're able to pick it up cheap and play it with a good friend, you'll probably have a good time.  Some of the environments are pretty interesting, and a couple of the puzzles are clever. However, there are some frustrations. First off, the combat is a little stilted.  The player is given a dodge-roll and a counter, but the timing on these seemed to be very stingy. Even after 11 hours with the game, I was never able to devise the actual rules that govern the counter (Can you only counter moves after the grey crossed blades are above the enemies heads? What about moves that aren't telegraphed? Do I need to be facing the enemy?, etc.).  With the dodge-roll, the player is given a sort of window that doesn't altogether make that much sense. With certain enemies, I would attempt to dodge-roll away more than a second before a blow landed, only to stand there watching myself get hit. There are also some hit-detection issues with traps in the game.  Often you'll find yourself hit by a trap that you pretty clearly dodged. The game also does this strange thing where despite the directional movement of a blade or spikes, you will always be pushed backwards towards the direction you came from, even when this makes no physical sense.  Lastly, there are multiple "duels" in the game, in which the second player simply stands on the sideline watching the other playing fight.  Pretty audacious move by the Devs, having me watch their mediocre combat in action, haha.  Despite all this, I had quite a few laughs playing this game, and I don't regret the time I spent with it.","June 2","true","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
