"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sinnoaria/recommended/377880/","sinnoaria","*Sin AI v4.444","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sinnoaria/","848 products in account","Fun game, not perfect, but worth checking out.\n\nGameplay: : 3.5/5\n\nThe game is rather simple for a trading card game, but there are many strategies that are viable for non-competitive modes. Unfortunately, the gameplay is not perfectly balanced, leaving some strategies much easier to use than others; however, despite some strategies being better, it is still fun making various decks to fight with.\n\nUnlike many recent card games, this game does not have an automatic battle mode where you simply play the cards and the game decides on the moves. Instead, you are in charge of many different aspects from whether a card attacks or uses a skill to even what you attack. In a defense state, you have little control if a card is attacked directly, but if the player is attacked, you may choose to defend with a specific card or not at all.\n\nUnfortunately, due to how defending works, it requires players to essentially know every card and with the ability to upgrade, this may become even more difficult.\n\nStory: 3/5\n\nThis game has a rather simple story, you are part of an organization that is fighting to maintain the balance between three warring factions. Of course, your actions are supposed to be neutral with no favorites, but as can be expected, being neutral and unbiased all the time can be rather difficult.\n\nUnfortunately, a large portion of the game is tied to the story with several unlocks and rewards being tied to story mode. That said, one may come to think of story mode as a long tutorial, which while somewhat interesting, it can feel tedious when the player wants to move onto other modes.\n\nFortunately for players who do enjoy story mode, certain story mode battles have mechanics that will rarely be seen elsewhere.\n\nGraphics/Audio: 2.5/5\n\nGraphically, the game has a decent resolution, but is limited as is apparent if viewed in full screen mode with a higher resolution monitor. As this game was originally for the Vita, this can be understandable. Fortunately, the game's graphics are still decent despite the limited resolution. It should also be noted that while the game defaults to a censored state, the game features an uncensored option for those who prefer the original art.\n\nThere are two noticeable issues with the graphics, first is that the game defaults to window mode when it starts instead of remember the last state, which combined with having to right click to access full screen mode may be annoying to some. The second issue is the more limited FPS, which players who are used to PC's higher FPS may find annoying. Unfortunately, this is unlikely to change due to animations, which would look odd at a different FPS.\n\nSome players have noted FPS drops, this may be system dependent or a side effect of battle animations.\n\nThe audio quality is decent for the game with voice acting and music to accompany the game. While nothing especially impressive, it is decent enough.\n\nPlay Time/Replayability: 3/5\n\nWhile much of the replayability of the offline game modes will be based on farming for gold in order to acquire better gear, the game can be a nice and calming to play. Story mode replayability will be primarily based on players who want a more static set of battles. Dungeon battles vary by the day, though there is still a limited amount of variety. PVC, or Player Vs Computer, battles are more randomized and can provide a decent amount of replayability. Challenge mode changes each week and players can try to make decks to get the best scores.\n\nThe majority of the replayability will be in online battles where players may form strategies to counter each other and fight in a more intelligent manner.\n\nFinal Score: 3.5/5\n\nThis game is worth trying out, especially when on sale. While it won't be a game of the year, it is fun and calming to play.\n\n====\n\nNotes:\nThis review is based on a beta build and focuses on offline mode. The reviewer beta tested the game; however, this review is the reviewer's own and not that of any company or outside organization.\n\nIn order to change to uncensored mode, go to your menu->configuration-> Card Type: Infinita\n\nUnlike the original, there are no microtransactions. There may be DLC in the future, but you can obtain everything through the weekly rewards, gold shop (gold is in-game currency), PvC, PvP, or Dungeons. Some cards can be obtained in multiple ways.\n\nThe inability to play offline has been somewhat resolved, hopefully they will add a patch to make it so that you can do dungeons offline.","April 21","true","770.6"," 65 of 77 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","65","77","0","2"

You get a chat box for dialogue, and a menu button to access everything the game doesn't do automatically. It is not a big deal, but it differs from all modern games that integrate your game choices into the game world.\n\nSomething that is not obvious from start is that you can go "home" and the game checks all your achievements and hand you bonuses. I assumed at first it was some kind of "restart the dungeon" option first and just tested it before I was supposed to quit. From home you can reach other modes (if unlocked) in addition to the default story mode.\n\nI actually didn't find any quit button, so I just closed the game.\n\nEven with these minor issues, the game is alright as a card game visual novel. Voices are nice, art is nice, and the card game is not too advanced (yet at least). You kind of get what you pay for. Nothing impressive, but a game that will suit most people who enjoy cards, visual novels and nudity.","April 22","true","99.8"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","17","25","0","0"

Out of the 600+ cards the game has, I want to say as of May 2nd, you are currently able to collect maybe 300, 350. Which, honestly is fine right now, since it might be a little too overwhelming to have all that content. Think of a classic freemium game, now remove any timers and cooldowns, and no real money transcations.\n\nSome cards are obviously more useful than others, and maybe you'll find the team you primarly use has some of the same cards no matter what type of deck you face. But the balance issues are fine. Because treat this game mostly as a single player game, since currently multiplayer is pretty empty. It's actually more efficient to go to the discussion page of the game and just request a match, or if you have a certain item, get a copy of one of that player's cards.\n\nThe art is what you see. If you ever wanted to see angels, dragons, yokai, monsters, lovecraftian horrors, and robots reimagined as anime girls, well, this is probably your best bet.\n\nInterface is a little bad. It's exclusively clicking. Hopefully they add in the addition of hotkeys. What other minor issues the game has are being worked on by the devs, and they seem to be pretty on top of things.\n\nOVERALL  if you like anime art, collecting cards, and want a nice little time waster that employs things like daily dungeons and weekly boss challenge fights, this game would be right up your alley.","May 2","true","106.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

For a lot of them, the devs cheaped out and reused the same base artwork but mirrored or recolored.\n-The VA work is very amateurish. Still acceptable for the most part (except for Cecile), but don't expect any big name seiyuu here because this game has none.\n-This game is old, which means whatever content exists for it is already done and no more is being produced. Worryingly, despite that not all of the content has been ported yet. We got 10 chapters of story with an ending, but we're still missing  an extra 5 story chapters, several cards and some other things pertaining to the non-story modes. With this being such a niche game with barely any community presence, one has to wonder if the publisher is even gonna bother bringing all that missing content.\n\n\nBuy if you like card games and lewd, and want to support no-censorship localizations with JP voices, just don't expect high production values.","May 20","true","25.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Maybe let us set an AI deck, which would be used when we're not online.\n\nThe whole dungeon mechanic is redundant, not fun and simply a waste of time - click several hundred times, each time watching a slow progress bar animation to fight 5-10 enemies. What could take 10-20 minutes takes an hour+ and rapid clicking to make the progress as fast as possible bears the risk of misclicking capture buttons and missing out on cards. I would suggest making progress automatic, with faster/toggleable animation and stopping only at events/bosses.","May 29","false","31.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
