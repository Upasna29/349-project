Lords of Football attempts to marry the football management experience with a sims-lite player management experience. How successfully it manages that seems to vary on a person by person basis. It may not be spreadsheety enough for the Football Manager fans and not Simsy enough for Sims fans.\nPersonally, I love it. The unlicensed football-lite side reminds me of Sensible Soccer and the Simsy side... well yeah obvious. The point is, the resulting gaming experience is pretty unique and great fun. What's more, the dev team is taking the usual indie route of listening to players and working hard to improve aspects of the game. Consider the newly released database editor allowing you to fully customize all the teams and players to your heart's content.\nUltimately, I like this game. I think the IP has potential and the developer has potential. I've clocked up 63 hours of playtime and I'm not done with it yet. Your mileage may vary but if you want to try something different then give it a shot, you might just find yourself hooked.","November 29, 2013","true","139.9"," 93 of 103 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","93","103","2","0"

After enjoying it for some time, you will inevitably notice some gaps in the gameplay mechanics.The original idea to combine footballer’s life simulation dynamics with football manager’s management mechanics is surely intriguing, but not fully developed, failing to entertain for more than a season or two.Although Lords of Football has some nice eccentricities and touches, it fails and also feels old and dated.Lords of Football is not a complete football manager that allows you to spend hours on tactical options or scouting for players. On the other hand, it is not a social simulation of footballers' life - you don't have much control over that aspect. The game can look like fun for a short while, but after a few hours it kills you with repetitiveness and boredom. A few interesting ideas aren't enough to save this game from oblivion. Overall 5/10.","July 19, 2014","true","9.3"," 45 of 52 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","45","52","0","0"

The managment styled training portion of the game is the best thing about it, where once a game starts it is a different story.\nThe games are slow, and come with a stratagy focused look to them, but there really is no stratagy, you command some players to do special tasks, and you have a limited amount of times you can command your players before it recharges, it would be just swell if the commands weren't the only way to score goals in the game, but sadly, that's not the case, as the AI are so astoundedly stupid that leaving them be without any commands is pointless.\nOverall the game is brilliant at first glance, but after spending some time with it you realize issues, and those issues pile on top of each other, and really make the game unpleasant to play.\n3/10- Would probably play here and there again for the concept, but then realize how undeveloped it feels, and put it back down.","October 27, 2014","false","5.5"," 45 of 56 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","45","56","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LdoSul/recommended/230650/","LdoSul","+300","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LdoSul/","272 products in account","I have mixed feelings about this game\nThe first thing you should know: Lords of football feels like a very superficial mix between The Sims and Football Manager. So don't expect to build houses and have a lot of customization like The Sims, and also don't expect to have all that in depth managment of Football Manager (it's not even close to that, it's REALLY simplistic. For example, you don't buy players, you simply build a wishlist based on skills and at the end of the season the game will drop some new guys in your squad). Besides all this, I have to say that I still had something fun after all.\n\nIn this game you will basicly run the training and night life of your squad by simply picking players up with the mouse, lifting them and then droping them in a respective area trying to satisfy their desires to maintain their morale high. This gets repetitive relly soon, even after you begin to complete challanges (like winning X amout of gams or scoreing X amount of goals) and by these beeing able to "build" new training structures. The training part and the night life part plays all the same, only with different themed stuff.\n\nThings get different when the night ends and you get to manage your players in a real time match. Now here comes the sad part: as a coach you can build tactics in a really simplistic way and also call orders for your team from the side of the fied, but this ends up seeming completely pointless since it's better to let your players to play on their own. It's a interesting but totaly wasted mechanic. At the end the best way to go for me was simply choosing a default formation based on the best players I had on the squad (even if this meand a really weird formation), never putting a player out of his best position and never shouting an real time order.\n\n-Another bad thing is that there are really really few buildings and activities available. For the "night life" for example, you have 6 structures only each one with 2 different activities to choose from.\n-The graphics could be better, even though the user interface is quite friendly once you get used to the interesting filter system.\n-Selecting individual player can be a real pain, since it feels like the filters or even your mouse clicks don't always behave as they should.\n-Maintaining all of your players needs at a time is almost impossible since the game dosen't give you enought training/night time to do everithing they need.\n-The training field could really use some sort of auto-trigger system to help you put the players in the right place (if you played Dragon Age origins you know what I mean)\n-The DLCs also feels a bit like a waste. Who even thought that mixing a "serious" soccer game with medieval stuff would be funny?\n\nSo in the end, this is a game where you will spend like 5 min draging and droping your players aroud the map and then another 5 minutes watching them play a match in really bad graphics (with some unpredictable behaviors), and repeat.\nIn 15 hours, starting with a 3/5 stars team I turned it in the best team of the league. I think I have experienced almost everything the game has to offer, and I feel it's not enought. With a bit more of development and with more buildings/activities this game could really be awsome. But as it is, the game is not worth more than 10 US$.","June 29, 2014","false","14.5"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","17","22","0","0"

Its about managing the players, keeping track of their progress and their addictions and making sure they are good for the real match. Different players will have different personalities, some will like to party, some like to get drunk, some like to gamble etc. The match play is not bad, You can choose to watch and give commands or simulate the match. Once you achieve some objectives set by the chairman, you can build additional stuffs or upgrade. Controls are quite easy however tending to each players, controling their addictions and to reduce their addictions are not very user friendly.\n\nTheres no finance aspects to take care of, transfer market only available in the open period, you cannot scout in advance or sell players by setting the price, everything is done by the chairman. Theres not much things to do except tending to players, training, building and playing match etc.\n\nOverall, unless you have spare money to try something different, this game does give some creative sparks but will not be able to keep your interest long enough. If you are looking for more in depth game play, players and such , Football Manager will be way up there.\n\n5.5/10 (If you really have some spare spare money wana try something different or take a look)\n\nShineshine logging out.","January 31, 2014","false","3.3"," 25 of 37 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","25","37","0","0"

The Game it self sucks. How can you have Footbal manager game no currency and i can not control the fun and the excitment that transfers bring. That right there is a killer for me. The idea behind game is great i just think they need to improve on the game by adding currency, allowing me to do transfers, and i hope i just have not figured it out yet but its really stupid that i can not put the starting formation my self and just have that be a default but iinstead you keep doing the same subs pre match every single game which tends to get pretty boring. I hate that i'm not in control of improving the facilites pitch etc as i would excpect a manager game to allow me that..","June 26, 2014","false","18.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The games were surprisingly fun to watch but... I could just watch a real game.

It's a football simulation, but it also isn't. And it's a life simulator... But also isn't. It's a bit difficult to describe this game. The football side is not as overly detailed as Football Manager for instance, but then again, that would take the fun out. Here, you aren't just constantly looking at numbers. Not to say that the life simulation is all that. It's not on the level of The Sims. It is what it is. It's just... Different. Fresh. It's not for everyone, but I certainly enjoy it. Even though it might not be the best in either of the two genres it tries to combine. For instance, I see people complaining about how managing all the addictions isn't easy. But it isn't supposed to be. They're supposed to be humans, not mindless drones. The best moments in this game are when you just let loose a little bit. Sure, my main striker was staying out late pretty much every evening, not showing up for practice, starting conga lines in the streets or sleeping on the sidewalk. But he kept banging in goals and ended as the league's top scorer. So who am I to judge? I hope this game gets a sequel. Because there certainly is enough to improve on. But this game is also one with great potential to build upon.","April 8, 2014","true","42.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
