It is an early access survival game, which are absolutely a dime a dozen, but ABD is trying a different route.   It is an MMORTS in the same vain as Age of Empires.   Definitely caught my attention when my friend mentioned it to me yesterday.\n\nThe devs are even kind enough to give you a free key if you are a current/former military vet.   I was lucky enough to receive a key, not just because of the dev's generosity (for which I am thankful for) but also it saved me spending $17.99 on this "game."\n\nTruly, early access can be a very useful tool for developers to polish their product and make necessary changes that the player base would like.  However, while the tool is nice, there is a time and a place to utilize it.\n\nSimply put, A Beautiful Day is anything but beautiful for the time being.  It just isn't ready for even early access in my opinion.\n\nYou maybe thinking, "you've only played this game for less than an hour.  How does your opinion matter?"  True, very true.  In the first 5 minutes the game has crashed a multiple of times.  Not an issue, bugs pop up with different systems naturally.  It isn't just that though.  The text in the game is extremely low res and hard to read.  The game skips past the starting menu screen and even bypasses your choice for race.  It literally throws you in an empty forest with other players.  All named "Jeff".   I couldn't cut down trees because I didn't have an axe and I couldn't attack players because I didn't have a weapon.  I couldn't interact with the interaction box nor read anything for the resource bar.  I could just right click move around at other Jeffs and listen to the very loud music/footsteps (hit escape and the game closes and the menu button doesn't do anything.)\n\nNormally, I would write this game off as a complete sham but the developers are nice and do seem to want to make a solid game.   They had stated that they will be patching the game quite a lot so let's see if they can turn this around.\n\nI will give the developers the benefit of the doubt and check on the game and progress if it is made I will reevaluate my review and recommend it if it is fun and playable.   For now?  Don't spend your money.\n\nEdit: 8/17/15-  A couple of patches have been put out.  I can now choose what race I want to play as but unfortunately can't move.    Still, the devs seem to be working on fixing the issues.  Will keep this updated :)","August 14, 2015","false","0.4"," 112 of 129 people (87%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","87","112","129","4","23"

Will update review after game updates.\n\n(08/16/15) Simply put, the game is unplayable for me. Too many threads apparently. The sound glitchs out. And while this might just be me, it turns my internet off. I tested it 10 times and every single time it crashs my internet turns off for a min.\n\n(08/17/15) The devs are trying to fix the problems now. Going to wait for the big announcement. (5:00) A small update just came out makeing the game playable. Still broken tho. (5:40) Another update. Can't tell what was changed. Lost my dude 5 mins in since the last update. Runs better in windowed mode. (6:15) I found a way to find my guy in the forums. Have 3 fps. (8:45) Can't connect. (9:25) Down for maintenance. The Devs are looking for for a second programmer.\n\n(08/18/15) After another update the game has become playable. It runs some what smoothly, has really bad pop in, glitchy, and don't have any in game options yet. But it only been here for a week or so so I'll forgive it...for now.\n\n(08/19/15) Another day of updates. Seems to run better now, very little lag. Still has pop in. Still have trouble connecting. A new glitch today, I don't spawn and neither do everyone else. Just a big map to explore. When I could play I could not gather anything. Good news is the devs has like 2-3 programmers now, so they should be able to fix bugs around the clock. Still not gonna recommend the game till it's stable and enjoyable tho.\n\n(08/21/15) A big update today. Apparently something going to happen this halloween, on the main menu it shows some kids eating a pumpkin stickman monster. Also the game won't just automatically shove you into the game anymore. Had to choose a faction again, last time I picked the first one, this time I picked the second one. Stayed passive. After it was done loading, everything pop up almost instantly. Still very little lag, was not stuck. After walking around a bit, I tried searching for stuff, but it must have glitched, because after standing still for 3 mins I was not getting anything. You HAVE to search at the begining of the game to get anything. Seeing a new logout button on the top, I hope that would put me back in the main menu, then click play, and that would fix the glitch. Nope. Closes the game. After I tried to get back in it was just the "connecting" thing forever. It feels like I can only play this game 1 time per day, like wtf. Please fix the search button already. Dear god, the Exit button on the menu doesn't even work.\n\n(08/22/15) Devs say game will be fully stable by the 28th.\n\n(08/23/15) No updates today. Devs say they'll announce something on the 24th.\n\n(08/24/15) Devs got rid of a bad programmer. Now they have, in they'r words, a super-jedi-guru programmer, we'll see about that.  So yeah, worst case scenario is the game being out by 4th of next month. Should be out earlier than that.\n\n(09/10/15) An update rolled out around 1 AM. It finally makes the game playable...to some extent. Like the Devs said you can't do much right now, only walking and chating with other players. Well you can do one of those I guess. Also you can't die right now. First time trying to spawn in, it spawn me out of the map, which I might say looks alot smaller than I thought it would, about mile in the air. After a minute of falling, I was under the map. I closed it and respawned. This time I was on sweet old dry land, but instead of haveing 1 unit, I had 4. 2 pairs. Knowing I can't do anthing, I...we went for a walk. After a few mins I started looking at the menus which was FAR to small, all I could read from the action menu was sneak, hide, and sprint. And the chat bar was so small, my thumb nails was bigger than it. Your camera is locked with your mouse, if you move at all, it does too. Also the curser is like 2 inchs away where it should be, so it's like you got 2. The WASD is locked to West, East, South and North, it's like one of those old RTSs lol. But yeah, this game is still brocken.\n\n(10/06/15) The menus have gotten bigger, still need to be bigger, or higher res. You can't rotate the screen or move it, it's locked on your units. Also it crashs on me.\n\n(10/29/15) A Halloween update is live. You're going to have to swich to beta mode first to play it. Had to start over again, not a big problem since I had nothing to begin with. After loading in, the first thing I noticed has it was very laggy, like 2 FPS. Also I was zoomed all the way out, all I could see is a crows flying around in a circle, foreshadowing much lol. After laggly zooming in I saw that I had 2 units on a hill side, another player's unit not too far away. After selecting both of them I told them to move down the hill, to a small forest. Only one of them moved, slowly, down the hill. You can't move more than one unit at a time, yet you can select both of them? Before I could even move the second one, the game crashed, not just a normal one either, my whole computer had a panic attack and froze until I forced ABD to close. After I joined the game again, my units was in the exact spot where they first spawned. While seeing if I could turn the screen to see different angles either by right click, holding down scroll whell, space, etc. It crashed again. After joining again I told both of my units to head into the small forest, it looked like they were rideing Electic Scooters...you know those things you stand on and ride? They seem to be stuck in sneak mode because of how slow they are going, I could not make them walk, jog, or sprint. We only got 3 actions now Move, Build, and Collect. After they got to the forest I told one to collect from a tree, doing so put a giant button in the center of my screen, after clicking it the unit started heading toward the tree. I wanted my other unit to collect too because we just started after all. But it would not work, so I told him to build which brings up a new tab, after clicking Fire Place he just droped at his feet...I wanted it atleast a few trees into the forest. Then the game crashed. The end. I'm sure they'll fix this very soon, but right now I'm going to wait intel then. If you want to know what they added, or what should have been added, head here- http://steamcommunity.com/games/384920/announcements/detail/69037901294430947\n\n(01/16/16) Months later and the game is still unplayable. While the game looks nicer, the game is pretty much in the same state it was the months before. Every single time I log in it asks me to make a new game, and if I don't do anything it just puts in my last game. Keeps spawning in the same place. Still move around West, East, North, South. Can't rotate the camera, even though it clearly says I can with q and e. Theres quite a few animals walking around, I envy them. Theres Deers, wolfs, and bears. I start with 2 units, male and female. I can't click them...wait I have to right click them. I can only select one at a time. Clicking on the ground does nothing, they won't move. The moveing actions are atleast simple now, Hide, Walk, Jog, Run, and Sprint. Still won't move. I noticed a new bar at the top of my screen when I have one of my units selected. Its says Go to, Move to, Equip, and Info. Go to and Move to? Whats the differece? Does not matter both does nothing. Info shows what resources the unit have, nothing. But it did show me a can only carry one resource unit at a time. Equip also shows I have nothing. I right clicked a tree and it completely changes to a different tree. In the new bar it says Harvest, Go to, and Info. Of course I picked Harvest. Nope.\n\nWelp I ran out of characters in this review. Stop blameing that one bad programmer, it was nearly 5 months ago, you rebuildt and got past that problem. My last words are "Make the game simple and work up from that". Just left click a unit and right click a tree to harvest it, come on man it's not that hard to do.","August 16, 2015","false","18.8"," 48 of 52 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","48","52","2","15"

The developer is a ♥♥♥♥ who deletes threads nay saying their game and bans those who call them out. The developer will sell anything it seems. From "bacon portraits" to perpetual motion engines (yes, really https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/826892372/bacon-portraits and https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/826892372/self-sustaining-electrical-turbine-generator?ref=users)\n\nThis was released back in August and I couldn't even get past the login screen. I sat and looked at a setup screen, which intermittently flashed other screens for no discernible reason, which was watermarked by the kit they used to make the damn thing. Then the game crashed when I tried to exit.\n\nAnother example of the myriad of problems this mess has had. I'm surprised they haven't resorted to their usual shitck. Blame this "Allen" guy, their initial programmer back AUGUST LAST YEAR. Who they still throw under the bus for their failings.\n\nThis is a fine example of yet another developer excreting a broken, unfinished game onto Steam and hiding behind "it's early access, what did you expect".\n\nEven before having a functioning version of the base game they tried to shill a $60 version of the game called the "Legacy Edition". When people, even their supporters cried fowl they claimed that it was a joke and for some reason people believed them and they swiftly deleted their "joke".\n\nI got this "game" for free in a giveaway and I still feel shafted. Steam recently introduced the option to have a game deleted entirely from your account. I thought on why anyone who use that option. Now I know.\n\n---------\n\nUpdate (Jan/29/16)\nJust to illustrate how bonkers this dev is he claimed to be contracted by another dev, who then didn't use his work saying it was unusable, only for him to issue a DMCA takedown of that game https://twitter.com/GAM_Ent/status/693451584735428611\n\nHe also seems to be on a warpath to sue everyone who says anything bad about him claiming "defamation".\n\nHe is completely out of his tree, though it is endlessly entertaining.","January 16","false","0.7"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","7"

Sad that steam allows such black sheep.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nEdit 22.08.2015\n\nAfter some one day of servers down to "fix" ( i had to laugh a lot) stuff they are up or maybe not ... the game starts and now you even can choose what race you want etc but after that it is jsut "connecting" for ever. So has to be seen if smt will happen in the next few days.\nThis game cleary has been rusehd out to grad some cash !!!\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nEdit 19.09.2915\n\nAfter nearly 3 weeks (look at release date on steam; devs deny that it came out so early,lol; but even if they released it a week ago still it is a shame this game),  out the dev's are not capable of fixing this broken piece of garbage... Still not playable at all. If, and i stress the word if you are able to login and see the game world you cannot run around or do antyhing. But today they found out that their server just cannot keep up like 15 minutes without crashing. So much for the skill of these supposed devs at work here. I would they a average kid with some game dev tool, wich you can buy here on steam are able tom ake more able games!\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\nEdit 17.08.2015\n\nAfter some days and few patches this agme is still a total piece of ♥♥♥♥. Now you can spawn but you cannot walk around you can do nothing ..... just a pice of joke.\n\nThis game is more like a pre pre pre tech demo alpha whre you just sit and watch some tress and hear weird sounds :(\n\nI would say just watch some let*s plays if you still wanna have it first !!!\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\nTotal scam and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.\n\nFatal erros every time you try to start the game. Cannot even play a second. "too many threads" is one of its favorite phrases....\n\nBest wait if this piece of crap ever makes it beyong early early early alpha ..... where you can actually do anything then cliking fatal erros massages.\n\n:(","August 14, 2015","false","0.4"," 26 of 49 people (53%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","53","26","49","5","18"

I see people are leaving negative reviews, which is somewhat understandable, but this game is in alpha/early access/whatever you want to name it. Leaving a bad review just because the servers haven't been up and/or bugs is foolish. The developers are very active, working diligently and always keeping the community updated via forums/chat.

The game isnt perfect no game ever is. that said I am eager to try out the new future blds and pass on the game to friends. I don't think I was treated fairly in the forums as I have said I only said 1 thing 1 time that the Develpers didnt like and got banned. I understand the need to not have negative people bash your game but censoring those people only makes them seem right, and in my opinion i was right I only asked the developer to be a responsible buisness owner and instead of giving weekly updates of updates that never come just tell us straightup hey this is my first time doing this entirely  got screwed over because i didnt make sure he was doing what i paid him too move on and give us a definitve release date even a single payer build :D,  But thats not for me to say All I could do is give my honest opinion even if the Developer had said there wont be a playable version for mre then a few months that would be fine with me, i purchased a game that was devloped by 2 devlopers over the course of 7 years, its not a fantastic game but they tried and so are these devlopers thats what counts to me. I realy hope the devlopers get the exposure that this game deserves and I really hope it can become the game that everyones wants to see and play, once again f you dont want to support devlopers then dont get it if your a person that understands ambitions and dreams then by all means by in because ts gonna be a great game if all the kinks can be worked out.\n\n:EDIT: due to financial constraints the devlopers have had to put this title on hold, so if you want to support them by al means support them but if you want a game that works and is fully complete then save your money for now and get something else.","November 10, 2015","true","2.2"," 2 of 15 people (13%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","13","2","15","5","17"

I do not have any game time, but I wanted to go ahead and do a review on more of the project and the team as apposed to actual gameplay at this point. I will go ahead and update this as I play the game and make sure to keep you all informed as I do.\n\nOkay so when I first saw this game on steam early access I was excited. When seeing their store page I was slightly concerned due to the negative reviews and like a lot of people instead of just moving on I wanted to learn more of why this game was seeing a lot of negative light.\n\nThis game had a really rough launch, the game was completely unstable and not playable and eventually it lead to the devs having to bring it down. I sympathize with everyone here who's butt hurt and upset about all this, but lets be real for a second and think about the situation. Steam early access by definition means the game is not complete. With that said there's absolutely no reason for the negative reviews. I like to look at early access as you're "donating" your money to back a project, similar to what you'd do on a kick starter. Okay, so with that out of the way I want to talk about the positives and why I "backed / bought" this game.\n\nWILL UPDATE THIS SECTION AS NEEDED!\nPros:\nVery friendly and active community\nBusy hard working development team\nCan talk with devs in group chat\nConstant updates and fast response timeCons:\n\nSo far I really don't have any until I actually get into the game. This will be sometimes tomorrow Friday the 4th\n\nOkay so I'm not trying to convince anyone to buy this yet. But if you're interested in learning more you can add me or just hop in the ABD group chat. Devs are in there all the time willing to ask any questions along with other fans like myself who have backed the game. And as I said I will be updating this as I go.\n\n~Seraphis","September 3, 2015","true","0.3"," 2 of 17 people (12%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","12","2","17","0","18"
