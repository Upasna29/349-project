"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hashir/recommended/43110/","Hashir","HasH","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hashir/","192 products in account","Metro 2033 is a FPS Survival and Action mix game set in a post-apocalyptic world where Russia is devastated by nukes and stuff which forces people live in the metro (Hence the name Metro 2033) but they are not the only one's there...\nThe game is really good as the survival part is crucial as u need to keep track of your gas filters... There is also some parts where u can either go guns blazing or use stealth to get past. The latter option is recommended as ammo is not that common to find which adds some realism to the game as the city/country is turned into a piece of ruins.\n\nIf u liked the S.T.A.L.K.E.R series or the F.E.A.R series then u will love this but Metro 2033 is more story-driven and has less open world elements but it adds some realism as there is nothing else to do in a nuked city with monster lurking around everywhere...\n\nI might add more to this as I am a lazy writer.\nEDIT: I did not see this coming how come I get over here... So I am going to add more stuff into this..\n\nWeaponsThe Weapon system is limited but has different playstyles so if u want to go stealthily u may want to take a VSV otherwise u can go a Kalash.\nIn some levels where there are mostly monsters the shotguns come into play and u can either use a Double barreled duplet or go for a ubonyeg which has 6 shells but they are fired in some kind of a revolving method so reloading it might take some effort to get all 6 shells loaded..\n\nThere is also your knife as the default melee weapon which can be used as a last hope for survival otherwise there are many other weapons like throwing knifes, grenades, sticky grenades and other pneumatic guns to choose from according to your playstyle.\n\nStealth:Like I mentioned earlier this game can be played both with stealth or with action... Stealth can help u alot in saving your precious ammo.. The stealth system is pretty easy as u have to just be aware of traps, broken glass and don't go into well illuminated areas or create some light yourself by either using a lighter, headlamp or even lighting the fuse of a grenade can give your position away.\n\nThe game has 3 levels of stealth. Green, Yellow and Red. Green means that u are completely hidden from them, Yellow means that someone have either noticed you or you made some noise, Red is pretty obvious they have spotted you and might be already shooting at you. U can see your stealth level by the LED Lights on your watch which can also be seen while holding some weapons. So you will not be putting your watch up all the time to check your stealth level.\n\nCurrency:The currency used in Metro 2033 is Military Grade Ammo which is hard to find and can also be used as ammo for some of your guns. They are much better than the Home brewn ammo which does less damage and is also known as dirty bullets.\nThe Military Grade Ammo(aka Golden Bullets) have a different look than the dirty bullets and since they are your only way to buy items & weapons u will have to really sure that u need to them in a battle or no since they can be easily wasted if u miss some shots.\n\n\nConclusion:I can easily recommend this game as it is just too good to try it out.It was bundled in the past and even given away for free.. Its not available on the store as the redux version is out which is just like a graphics update and maybe abit of tweaks and stuff..\nThe game is almost 4 years old now but the graphics is still good and there is rarely any bug that I encountered.. The game can keep u busy for around 50 hours or so even though the story is not that long but if u want to finish the game on Ranger Hardcore and get all the achievements it can easily take 3 complete playthroughs to get them.","October 11, 2014","true","21.4"," 320 of 356 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","320","356","3","9"

I know i am incredibly late with reviewing this game, i finished it about 30 minutes ago, and was blown away by the ending (not going to spoil anythin though) I played Last Light before i played 2033, and actually think i like 2033 better. Last light is a brilliant game, but this game had such a great personality.\n\nIn Metro 2033 you live in the (you guessed it) underground metro in Russia, the year 2033. You play as the very silent Artyom. Who barely remembers anything from before the nuclear war, which made the surface of the earth unhabitable. Artyom is a Ranger, who has sworn to protect his homeland from any threat out there in the tunnels of the Metro, and up on the surface. A grand threat has emerged from the distant areas of the surface. The so called "Dark Ones" start messing with peoples minds, and takes controll over Human controlled outposts and such. It is now up to Artyom, and the few Rangers to eliminate this threat. "If it's hostile, you kill it."\n\n+The game is stunningly beatifull\n+Great game mechanics\n+Interesting (altough few) weapons and tools\n+Interesting and adaptive world\n+I Personally encountered no bugs\n+Terrifying monsters\n+Creepy enviroment\n\n-Bulky face animations\n-Not the greatest voice acting (and why does only Artyom speak in the loading screens?)\n\nMetro 2033 is a must have for anyone who enjoys somewhat scary games. You can probably pick it up really cheap on the christmas sale in a couple of days, i got it for about 3 euros last fall sale.\n\nMust have. 9,5/10\n","December 18, 2013","true","11.5"," 260 of 284 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","260","284","0","8"

The guns are believable but also desperate feeling, the sound design is top notch, and when playing with all Russian language on Ranger Hardcore mode the immersion level surpasses anything I had experienced before in a video game.\nGenerally I recommend playing sequels when the original is beginning to age, but Metro 2033 is by no means out of date.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/recommended/43110/","miyumiayase","Miyumi Ayase","http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/","288 products in account","INTRODUCTION:Metro 2033 is a first-person horror survival shooter based on a novel of the same name written by Dmitry Glukhovsky. It is the first game on the franchise. It was released originally for the PC and was followed up a few months later by an Xbox 360 release and was generally regarded as one of the most graphically intensive games and the number one contender to the 2007 game Crysis as a PC benchmark on gaming.\n\nThe player takes the role of Artyom (Артём), a young man who has lived his entire life within the confines of his home 'VDNKh (Exhibition)', a Metro Station below Moscow where the citizens ran for shelter during a Nuclear war that brought about nuclear Winter. Join Artyom in his quest to reach the main station of Polis and ask for aid against a new threat from the surface, a threat that may potentially wipe out the remnants of humanity.\n\nPROS:+ Unrivalled Atmosphere and World Design\n+ Surprising level variety despite being stuck mostly in a Metro (Subway) System\n+ Magnificent graphics and excellent use of Physx technology\n+ Good story that offers alternate endings and a very subtle morality system that does affect the final out come of the game\n+ Great blend of Action and Horror\n+ Weapon variety\n+ Linear story but with substantial content and room for exploration\n+ English and Russian voices are really well done which makes each character memorable in their own unique ways\n+ Refreshing new setting of Russia\n\nCONS:- Occasional FPS drops, specially on the surface\n- Stealth in some levels become completely impossible to execute and is thrown out the window in favour of a shoot out\n- Enemy and creature AI are very underwhelming and does not do the atmosphere or the novel any justice\n- Unimpressive animation quality\n\nCONCLUSION:GREAT GAME. Metro 2033 provides great atmosphere, amazing environments, and great characters that are both memorable and excellently voice acted. Although the gun play is underwhelming, it still delivers with its story, atmosphere and horror elements.\n\nWORTH IT:I can easily RECOMMEND this game at its full price if you're either a fan of first-person survival horror or post-apocalyptic settings.\n\nThis is not an Action-RPG game like STALKER or Fallout. Metro 2033 falls in line with games such as FEAR and DOOM 3.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

One of the best single player FPS games I have played in years.\n\nSet in a post-apocalyptic world where the people of Russia only survive in the underground Metro stations and tunnels, you play Artyom, a young rookie training to be a Ranger. Your world is a harsh one where warring factions clash against each other, deadly mutants and a mysterious race known as the Dark Ones, a foe so deadly they turn men mad just by being near them. Your mission is to get help, and save your home station, but events on the way will have you doubting that mission, and perhaps your own sanity.\n\nI played this game on the most brutal difficulty on my first play through: Ranger hardcore. Many people will tell you not to do that but I disagree. It made the game exciting, almost terrifying, and a truly on edge experience. Combat will come down to whoever gets shot first dies. And with ammo so very rare you better not just shoot fast, you better not miss. Played like this, you feel like you really are a survivor.\n\nBut brutal combat aside, this game is not actually about the fire fights, it is about the story. And what a story it is. From the very start it dragged me in both heart and mind. This story has a powerful message and forces you to face the harsh reality of life and death and ask yourself what you would do to survive.\n\nMy only advice to you if you decide to play this game is if you play Ranger Hardcore, know this: Military Grade Ammunition is the currency in this game. DO NOT SHOOT IT :)\n\nIf you want to hear my thoughts on the game at the end of my let's play, you can find it here (CONTAINS SPOILERS): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxJJoSdOeHA\n\nNOTE: If you are thinking of buying this game you may want to look at Metro 2033 Redux. I have not played it but it is what I would buy if I were to replay the game.","January 5, 2015","true","0.3"," 108 of 119 people (91%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","91","108","119","5","5"

It's going to be hard to find such realistic game as Metro 2033.\nTurned off lights, set the difficulty on Ranger Hardcore, turned volume up.... ---> possibly one of the hardest video games I have ever played, but definitely one of the best.\nThe realism level on this game is jaw-dropping. People act naturally, atmosphere is amazing, you start to care about the protagonist and the events that happen.\nIt may look like the first part of the game is already challenging and the main character gets into every possible kind of trouble. You will get stuck in dark tunnels where mutants are roaming, you will run out of oxygen on the surface, assisst to the ugly shade of war between russian powers, at a time when they should help each other survive and many more.. But after the first half of the game you will realize all those things were just a preparation for what's coming.\nI recommend you to play with Russian voice acting (and English subtitles), this is how the game was intended and it adds a new level of immersion. Also, if you have the guts, try playing on the hardest (and by far the most realistic) difficulty, like I did. It will turn out as a very rewarding experience.\n\nPros: +The most realistic FPS I have ever played, speaking of the accuracy with which the mankind was represented in a video game;\n+ The attachment with the main protagonist;\n+ The Ranger Hardcore difficulty;\n+ Excellent atmosphere and voice acting;\n+ Incredible graphics;\n+ Replayability, for the other ending;\n\nCons: - Some bugs can be game-breaking and require restart of the level;\n- Only a few Metro stations, in which you take a break from the harsh tunnels and surface;\n- The AI is sometimes pathetic;\n\nOverall, this game is a MUST for those who enjoy a FPS with a different approach than most others; a FPS where you are not a heavily-equipped soldier, but a normal living man in the stations whose destiny is about to be accomplished.\n\nPersonal rating: 93/100 - Amazing","March 28, 2015","true","16.6"," 77 of 82 people (94%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","94","77","82","6","6"

Although a redux-version appeared more recently, I preferred to play the original game, curious about the developer's (4A Games) original intentions and achievement.\nAnd some achievement it is: set in a post-nuclear Moscou, where life is mostly confined to the relative subterrean safety of the metro stations and tunnels, this game got under my skin from the start in a way that only few games have managed to do so.\n\nThe game is based on the internationally bestselling novel series by the Russian writer Dmitry Glukhovsky, and as such takes its place among other games based on important books, most noticeably The Witcher series. The narrative element of the game is extremely important: playing as a young Russian, Artyom, you are going on a mission which at first involves saving your home station, but which gradually evolves into something much bigger. The game does an excellent job at immersing the player in the claustrophobic but somehow still functioning society that is surviving in the Moscou metro: passages of peace and tranquillity offer more than enough possibilities to get acquainted with the circumstances in which people manage to survive. While walking around in a station, you often overhear people talking to each other and it pays off to listen to these conversations – they often give important extra information to the next part of the game, or just offer an immersive background. Voices can be set to either Russian or English – I played with English voices the first time, since the subtitles don't translate every conversation, but wnet with Russian the second time around, and though I don't understand the language, it surely made the illusion of being there much more real.\n\nWhile the game mostly uses fairly standard first-person shooter game mechanics, the gameplay stays fresh and interesting all the time. This is mainly due to the fact that the game encourages and rewards a stealthy approach more than going in guns blazing, especially on the higer difficulty levels. And speaking of difficulty, Metro 2033 got a special, very interesting "Ranger" mode added as a free dlc, which not only takes away the heads-up display but also dramatically reduces the amount of medkits, gasmask filters and especially bullets available throughout the game. The "Ranger Hardcore" mode effectively turns the game from a very good first-person shooter into a truely remarkable first-person post-apocalyptic survival game, where every bullet counts and running out of the very sparse filters for your gasmask turns into certain death. I definitely recommend playing it on this setting - when playing carefully, it offers a very rewarding experience indeed.\n\nMetro 2033 also uses its amazing graphics engine to create a dark and very scary atmosphere, both in the subterrenean portions and in the parts of the game that take place outside in the bombed-out ruins of Moscou. Playing it in complete darkness with my headphones on, it turned into a frightening experience more than once. The story developes from a personal quest for help into a much more universal theme, with the fight against the so-called "Dark Ones" posing very interesting and not so straightforward moral questions about war & peace, good and bad. It is especially this extra dimension, which is woven very sparsely into the game, which lifts it up to a higher, quite unexpected level. Combined with the excellent gameplay, the simply amazing graphics and the truly stunning soundscape, this adds up to a classic action game, which should be in any serious gamer's library.\n\nPlaying on my mid-range Skylake i3 dual-core@3.7 Ghz, GTX 760 & 8GB of ram, the game ran very smoothly on the highest settings, although enabling the superb nVidia PhysX did tax the graphics card a bit, dropping slightly below 60fps now and then. The game comes with a very interesting bunch of Steam achievements, which invite the player to try out different approaches and to explore every inch of the world.\n\nEssential gaming experience, which not only offers top-notch action and stealth gameplay, but poses some questions to seriously think about too.","April 28","true","39.1"," 53 of 55 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","53","55","2","1"

A Railroaded FPS Game With Good Horror Atmosphere. Genre: First Person Linear Shooter with Horror and Stealth Mechanics.\nDeveloped and Published by: 4A Games & Deep Silver.\nPlatform: Windows and Xbox 360.\nBusiness Model: Base Game\nCopy obtained from a friendOh, hello there STALK---whoops, sorry, wrong game. What is it with Ukrainian developers that can make post-nuclear-apocalyptic games so compelling? In any case, here’s my review of Metro 2033. I love to hate to love this game. It was a difficulty journey to survive in the horror-filled Metro. So, let's talk about Metro 2033 (Original).\n\nPersonal History With Game\nMetro 2033 has taken me over two years to complete it. I originally started it back in 2012 but after running into a majorly frustrating section (read: I died a lot), I put the game back on the shelf, to be played at a later date. Well, with the release of Metro 2033 Redux, I took a new interest in the series and tried tackling the Redux edition. See this review: A Paladin's Metro 2033 Redux Steam Review for my very unhappy thoughts towards it. But I couldn’t let my journey in the Metro come to an end a second time like that. I refused to be stopped by some game breaking bug. So, I reinstalled Metro 2033 and picked up where I had left off in the redux edition.\n\nContrast to Redux/Overall Gameplay Thoughts\nCompared to the redux edition, this game is filled with in-game cutscenes which often take the control out of your hands to a jarring degree. Compared to Redux, I feel like this stealth system is a lot better. Maybe its because the game was designed from the ground up with it in mind rather than slapped together. I much prefer having a gradient of whether you’ll be spotted rather than YES/NO stealth system of the later entries in the Metro series. That said, 2033’s stealth sections biggest annoyances is how spread out the save spots are. A death at an inopportune time right before the next save section can set you back a long way. Other thing I feel is superior in the original is the combat. In ranger mode, bullets feel sufficiently lethal. One shot to the head will take pretty much everything out. Hitboxes feel realistic as well. You hit armor and the bullet won't be lethal. It avoids having bullet-spongy enemies in the Ranger mode, moreso than the redux edition's ranger mode. I find that this game strikes the right balance with its combat. Except with the enemies near the end. Whoever designed those anemones is…..well, let’s just say they are an unexpected difficulty spike.\n\nThe survival aspect is rather challenging. You can easily get to a chapter of the game where you're up in the surface of the world and run completely out of air filters. Or bullets. Or everything. This could be game-ending as the pace of the scripted sequences doesn't let you rush through everything as you desperately try to find new air filters. I'm not really sure what to think of it because it does feel cheap at times with how quickly you can go through air filters. I'm conflicted on this part of the game mechanics...\n\nPC Settings & Options\nThe graphics settings menu is reasonable but more fine-tuned control would have been appreciated. You can tweak resolution, AA, AF and which version of DirectX you use. It comes with a quality slider to change the rest of the settings. (Grrr, death to quality sliders). This game is a monster on older cards, so unless you have something within the last couple of years, set it to DX9 and lower the quality. Additionally, if you want to change the FOV (because its set to a small 60ish FOV), you’ll need to get into the config files. The maximum you’ll be able to do is 90-100 without breaking the game. It’s a pretty game but I found optimization to be lacking in many places, especially when there’s a lot of enemies on the screen coming to rip a new hole in your head. You’ll want to take a look at the PCGamingWiki[pcgamingwiki.com] article to be sure you’re ok with the options given to you.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nMetro 2033 is a railroaded FPS game that doesn't give you a lot of room to experiment or change your journey. A lot of the time, it feels like an incredibly fancy rollercoaster ride with guns. There are some sections I feel were specifically designed to show off to the player. What I find most odd about the story is that you’ll get loading screens with Artyom, the main character, talking to the player but he’ll be silent with any interactions with NPCs. I don’t know why they don’t just have him talk to the NPCs, it’s a weird choice by the developers.\n\nBe warned that the game is filled with optimization problems and bugs that can ruin the experience entirely. Being a Russian post-apocalyptic FPS survival game, I really enjoyed it, despite all the frustrating problems I encountered. It says something about a game that I am willing to hazard the game issues to enjoy the content of the game because I do not tolerate bad games bugs or no bugs. It’s why I quit the Metro 2033 Redux edition because of how far backwards it went mechanically. I definitely recommend this version over the Redux edition because the stealth system, combat and lighting system in the original is much better. With that said: good luck in the Metro, you’re going to need it.\n\nRead this review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]\nRead my review of the Metro 2033 Redux Edition\nA Paladin's Review of Metro: Last Light Redux[wp.me]\nExcerpts from Last Light Review on Steam","October 23, 2014","true","15.2"," 68 of 79 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","68","79","0","5"

It features excellent visuals: DirectX 11 allows eye-popping animations of which few games take advantage. Metro 2033 has beautiful lighting, shadows, and tessellation, and explores motion blur in good ways.\n\nThe flaw, in my eyes, is that you are asked to make choices early in the game that could make the game un-finishable later. In particular: you can only purchase good, full air filters for your gas mask at the beginning of the game. This means that a standard strategy of conserving your cash at the beginning until you know what you really need will result in a failed game. You'll get through 2/3 of the game and find that you can't continue, because you can't scavenge enough air filters on the way. And because it's a game-on-rails, you can't go back to the beginning, or take a side trip to a marketplace. You're stuck.\n\nThis style of gameplay, this artificial difficulty, is a tactic of early adventure games. Asking you to restart the game and try again smacks of having your lantern stolen by the thief in Zork I. You're hosed, but you don't know it yet. And when you find out, you have to restart, and waste all of the effort you've made.\n\nGames today generally let you make bad decisions, but they also let you recover from those decisions. This is different than games being "hard" or not hard" - I'm talking about coupling two different game design mechanics that don't go together well: 1) linear progression and 2) being able to make choices, in a knowledge vacuum, that could break the game.\n\nAfter realizing I had broken my chances of finishing the game, I looked around online and found that this is a common complaint of Metro 2033. But, I also learned that the game has several ways to get different endings that require you to do certain strange things in the beginning. For example, to collect particular items from different locations and bring them together. This means you'd have to play the game several times to get these different outcomes. This confirmed for me that the "gotta know to buy air filters" problem was probably a design choice, an intentional punishment. BOO.\n\nOf course, Metro 2033 is frequently on sale, and I've seen it in a Humble Bundle, so it's hard to complain. If you buy it, just remember to stock up on air filters at the beginning!","October 20, 2013","true","6.9"," 85 of 105 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","85","105","0","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jigron/recommended/43110/","Jigron","♒JIGRON","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jigron/","336 products in account","QUICK REVIEW\n\nINSTANT CLASSIC\nHot on the coat tails of Half Life 2, Bioshock, Crysis, and other modern classics; Metro 2033 sets the standard for gameplay and storytelling.\n\nSTORY\nSet in a post-apocalyptic Russian wasteland, everyone is forced into the metro stations to escape from the cold nuclear winter raging above. This may seem like it limits the game from the start, but it does not. The metro gives the game a feeling of claustraphobia and paranoia. There are parts of the game which take place outside of the metro however, which gives an exciting contrast between the outside world and the underground. I won't go into the main story because honestly it's better to experiance without a lot of knowledge beforehand.\nHowever...\nThere is a spooky and interesting backstory throught the game which adds a veil of mystery and discovery, reveal ancient secrets and explore the unknown...\n\nCHARACTERS, ITEMS, AND ENEMIES\nYou will encounter a wide range of enemies in the metro, with a wide range of skills and faults. The way you deal with them is completely up to you, with an arsenal of DIY style weapons and customizations, making each fight a fresh experience, and the overall game replayable and open.\nHowever...\nIn the metro, there are greater enemies than horrifying monsters and communists. The air you breathe is commonly your biggest threat. Your gas mask and filters become your best friend in the metro, keep them close and stocked to the best of your ability.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nWhere do i even start?\n---\nAI AND COMBAT SYSTEM- Enemy AI in Metro is pretty spotless, especially in creature AI. Creatures attack based on how they are designed, and how similar animals attack IRL. For instance, the wolf-like 4 legged creatures will attack in packs. Whereas winged creatures will swoop in on you and retreat for another pass. Ape like creatures use their bigger brains for more coordinated attacks and tactics. Human AI is engaging and unpredictable, while still being fair and interesting. Humans will use cover and switch cover when appropriate, they will cover eachother for approaches and even flank you. Everything i just said works well and allows for a different experiance every time you play it.\n\nLEVELS AND VISUALS- As a pretty hardware taxing game for it's time, the visuals are on par with the industry standard even now. Slick dynamic lighting and some hardcore textures, models and tessilation makes for an astoundingly beautiful and breathtaking game. There's times where you'll say "Oh goodness" out loud. As far as levels go, the direction is intuitive and straight forward. In the early metro levels you can almost always tell where you're supposed to go, and what your objectives are. In the later levels, not in the metro, some stages can be hard to navigate. Levels always feel open, no invisible walls to break immersion. Everything feels realistic and centered in the game, nothing was compromised to make it feel like you were completely involved in the world.\n\nSETTINGS- Custom mapping, full visual customization, gameplay tweaks. This game has everything that you'd think is standard. Unlike other games. FOV isn't frustratingly foreward either.\n\nCONTROLS- Solid. Mouse acceleration is NOT mandatory. Moving around/jumping feels polished and comes easilly.\n\nGUNPLAY- Shooting things is extremely satasfying, each weapon has learning curve (Some more than others). Everyone who plays will have a weapon for them. A stealthy pneumatic accuracy rifle, or an all out assault rifle, this game has it all.\n---\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS:\nA symphonic mix of art and story, Metro 2033 is one for the ages. It will keep you on the edge of your seat, make you cry, and then laugh in the same hour. An ancient secret to uncover, a mysterious twist that will make you break out your magnifying glass and pipe.\n\nWill you survive the metro?\n","September 28, 2014","true","27.2"," 46 of 50 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","46","50","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MACROPOWER/recommended/43110/","MACROPOWER","+MacroPower","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MACROPOWER/","1064 products in account","Metro 2033 is an action/horror game set in the Russian Metro Stations. After a worldwide nuclear war, only ash and ruin is left on the surface. Metro is a very immersive, atmospheric experience. It doesn't try to make itself a horror game in the way something like Amnesia or Slender might (putting you in the dark, and building tension for the inevitable jump-scare). Metro simply pulls you in so far that you fear for your life, and for the lives of your comrades. There were times that I completely forgot that I was playing a video game. This superb immersion, coupled with good storytelling and excellent voice acting, makes Metro a fantastic shooter worthy of a place among games like Bioshock and Half-Life.\n\nMetro also has some supernatural elements, of which I will not go into detail to avoid poisoning your experience, should you decide to play Metro for yourself. However, I can tell you that the encounters are all very well done. Most of them are chilling experiences that you probably will not forget.\n\nThe graphics in Metro are better than a lot of modern games. Many parts of Metro look fantastic, and considering most of the game is set inside tunnels, this is an achievement on its own. Like Half-Life, Metro will put you through horrible, cramped spaces- but now and again you find something visually spectacular, which keeps you pushing forward. This is something many games similar to Metro lack. They will try to keep you motivated enough to plunge through hell, but don't give any indication as to what end.\n\nI enjoyed the different weapon types, and searching for ammo and other supplies was, in most cases fun, and in other cases completely tolerable. I find myself hating having to comb areas for ammo in other games, but I never once thought it boring in Metro. Combat, though only slightly above par, was elevated by the other elements in Metro. Just shooting something head-on is normal, but when you're alone in the Metro, enemies could come at you from any side. Your mask is almost broken, and has completely fogged over. You might have six minutes before you suffocate to death, if you're lucky. Getting air in your lungs is already a struggle, there is an audible rasp as you make another attempt to gain one last breath. A growl is heard, but it's impossible to tell from which way. And then the silence comes.\n\nOverall, Metro is stupidly cheap for what you're getting. Expect about 8 hours of gameplay on normal. The game also offers a hardcore mode that takes away your hud, so you have to aim using your sights and count your bullets. This would probably bring the level of immersion to a whole new level, should you be brave enough to attempt it.","January 10, 2014","true","8.9"," 47 of 52 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","47","52","0","0"

It doesn't need long cutscenes were characters lay out the exposition: the game *shows* you. Dark deserted subway station, paint peeling off the walls, your footsteps eerily echoing in the tunnels...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drmircow/recommended/43110/","drmircow","Dr. Mircow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drmircow/","677 products in account","Metro 2033 is a survival horror first-person shooter game set in a post-apocalyptic Moscow, with meticulous focus on authentic eerie atmosphere and good, albeit linear, narrative -- backed up by solid gameplay. It is also, without an argument, a spiritual successor to the highly admired cult franchise, S.T.A.L.K.E.R.\n\nThe story, based on the book by the same name, follows a young survivor by the name of Artyom who is being sent on a quest to find a way to stop a group of mysterious creatures named The Dark Ones from threatening his home metro station. Although Artyom is a silent protagonist, he does narrate the story’s progress from his point of view at loading screens. Throughout his journey, he faces many detours and ends up meeting various characters – some cool like Khan, but others rather generic and forgettable Russian stereotypes -- trying to help him and vice-versa. While the story is intriguing and appealing on the surface, it is more or less kind of straightforward. By the time the ending credits roll, you would have predicted one (the canon) of the two endings, possibly an hour prior to it. While the story experience is there, Metro’s story can feel unambitious at times, maybe because of the lack of unexpected twists and fully fleshed out characters. On the other hand, Metro’s narration is rock solid for an unashamedly linear shooter which it represents, and does not disappoint. Not a bit.\n\nThe gameplay literally plays like any other first-person shooter out there, however Metro 2033 does throw in a few stealth levels, which can still be approached in a Rambo fashioned style - although it is vastly unadvisable in these situations. Surprisingly, the stealth mechanic is functional and rather an enjoyable approach to taking down hostile human enemies in particular. The pace between shooting and stealth does help after all, and it is good to see a consistency in this aspect. It is a relief knowing the stealth was not something tacked on the last minute. Unlike other shooters, the game uses your bullets as currency, meaning that you have to be very cautious in how you “spend” them – whether that is wasting them on hostile enemies or buying new weapons or upgrades. This mechanic increases the challenge of the game, making it more tactical at times but nothing too substantial. And Metro 2033, even on normal difficulty, has a handful of challenging segments. For a true survival experience, it is recommended playing on Ranger difficulty only after completing the game once on an easier difficulty. Lastly, the oxygen mask is vital for survival and requires taking great care of it since it is damageable. Mask filters are also required to be scavenged and replaced from time to time. This creates another layer of tactic in the gameplay, and encourages exploration to a degree.\n\nThe greatest asset Metro 2033 can offer to the player is its mesmerizing artistic and technical prowess to atmosphere, level and sound designs. The underground metro, as well as the outside world, provide enough varied locations without ever feeling a sense of déjà vu. The metro itself is quite a unique environment in its own right. While from a technical point of view is not on par with Crysis’s standards pushed at maximum, it is nonetheless quite a remarkable benchmark. It is visually impressive from start to finish and satisfying to witness the amount of attention put into details. Audibly, it also never fails to create the sensation of anxiety (what could be lurking around the corner?) and creepiness. At one point, even your heavy breathing inside the oxygen mask will start scaring you; and that’s another example of a detail well executed. Owning a good headset will undoubtedly enhance this experience drastically. Taking inspiration from S.T.A.L.K.E.R., the metro stations are places where you wish you could just spend the entire day in them: walk around, chat, join your fellow survivors next to warm campfires and play the acoustic guitar. The atmosphere created here is a good contrast to the metro’s dark tunnels. It is believable and well executed. Where is my sausage and vodka, comrade?\n\nSuch a splendid game is however not without its fair share of problems. Firstly, Metro 2033’s main problems do arise from the poor engine optimization which can clog even some high-end computers, especially set on high video settings. Such issues can range from instable frame rate drops to a few minor visual glitches now and then. Could this be the price to pay for impressive visuals? No, and that is because other equally impressive games have done a better job delivering a similar visual experience (not identical) without compromising on optimization. At the end of the day, Metro 2033 is very much playable. However, the Redux Edition which came out four years later not only improved the visuals even further, but it finally optimized the game. Thus, pick that version.\n\nAs mentioned previously, the game can be challenging even at normal difficulty. This is good news for people looking for a challenge, however some of it can be a bit cheap especially in the station occupied by the Nazi faction. There you feel like the enemies never seem to stop showing up. The is AI competent, but there will be times where the enemies show up behind you and kill you cheaply without much time to counteract, especially when you are low in ammunition. So expect to reload a lot. The enemy variation is also acceptable, but the first few hours do feel like you are fighting against the same creatures/humans over and over again.\n\nWhile this remains a personal preference, the game could have had more freedom when exploring the environment. Not because this has to be a standard nowadays (even back when it was released), but because it feels like a missed opportunity considering the great, albeit linear, level design; especially the opportunities provided in the outside world. Right from the start to the end, Metro 2033 forces you to follow this linear path with only moments of exploration being the close surroundings of these paths looking for supplies. And in general you cannot backtrack. It is obvious by design that the game was made in such a way where it focuses in telling a story rather than role-playing. It is story-drivern after all. So is it a railway shooter by these standards? Well, in many aspects, yes. Funnily enough, you do spend some time on rail carts when travelling from one station to another. But is this detrimental to the experience? Absolutely not. While it may be linear and lacking exploration, it is a fulfilling experience; boasting solid gameplay and authentic atmosphere, narratively well written.\n\nIn conclusion, Metro 2033 is essentially a linear S.T.AL.K.E.R. game with more emphasis in telling a story, and by level design it is similar to the Half-Life franchise. While the story might not be that ambitious, its top-notch atmosphere with enough scary moments, unique environments, solid gameplay and a well written narrative are sufficient to make it a great game in many people’s eyes. No Hollywood CGI cutscenes and flashy cinematography. And that is what Metro 2033 is all about after all: the game experience. A game which everyone must give it a shot at least once, if they own a performing computer and can accept some of its rough edges around the corners.","November 8, 2014","true","14.0"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","26","29","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mauno/recommended/43110/","Mauno","Mauno","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mauno/","529 products in account","The best linear shooter I've played since Half-Life 2.\n\nGameplay is brilliant, especially on the harder difficulties (Ranger Easy & Hardcore) where every bullet counts and every mutant is a threat. The gunplay is great: all the weapons sound and feel incredibly powerful, even the pneumatic air rifle! The actual weapon visuals are cool as well: shotguns and air guns made of scrap metal, proper AK's, badass revolvers and a lot more.\n\nOutside the Metro, on the streets of Moscow, the gameplay is more focused on surviving a ridiculously hostile environment. Players will be looking for gas mask filters, medkits and small ammo caches, while being hunted down by a few different types of mutants. The gas mask mechanic makes the surface levels feel tense:  wasting time is not an option, Moscow is an irradiated hellhole and the filters only last a few minutes each. Acting fast and decisively is key on the surface; sneaking around like in the underground levels is not really a viable tactic.\n\nIn the Metro, stealth is often the best way of making progress, though it is entirely possible to play through the game shooting every bad guy in the face. Stealth mechanics are a bit simple, but they work well enough: there's a visibility indicator on the wrist watch; when it goes yellow or red, you're going to get spotted if someone happens to look at your way. It's fun, feels fair and since the game is still a proper FPS, the punishment for failure is an awesome firefight! (ie. not really a punishment at all.)\n\nIt's not a perfect game, however. It does an especially poor job at making the player care about the NPC's. They are all, with two or three exceptions, entirely forgettable. Having read the book the game is based on, I know who most of the people are, but those who jump straight into the game may have trouble with that. The only characters the game actually tries to make the player care about are Bourbon, Khan and Colonel Miller. The various rangers that accompany\n\nThe story itself is, in my opinion, bloody amazing. Artyom, the main character, is from a remote Metro station under siege by mysterious creatures. He's been tasked with reaching the legendary station of Polis, in the center of the Metro, and ask for their help in the defense of his home station. Artyom's journey is full of obstacles: haunted Metro tunnels, mutant hordes, a war between the 'Nazis' and the 'Reds', and much more. In the end, the player's actions determine how Artyom resolves  his home station's problem. The so-called "bad" ending is considered canon in the sequel, Last Light. This bad ending is also the default one, getting the other one takes quite a lot of effort throughout the entire game, and is clearly designed for repeat playthroughs.\n\nMetro 2033 and its sequel are quite possibly the best-looking games I have ever played. It's incredible how good the game looks, considering it's already three years old and was made with an absolutely pathetic budget (Last Light, the more expensive sequel, was developed with less money than some companies spend on cut scenes only.) It's amazing how they managed to make simple metro tunnels look so cool with the ridiculously good-looking lighting and volumetric effects. The surface levels are even more impressive than the underground ones: frozen Moscow is full of detail, and the weather effects are pretty damn realistic (source: I'm a Finn, we have snow.)\n\nAudio design is equally great. All guns sound powerful, voice acting is great (for extra immersion, play in Russian w/ subtitles).  Empty Metro tunnels have eerie ambient noises: "singing" pipes, slight wind, rats (and mutants) running around, etc. The atmosphere is pretty close to what's found in the STALKER games: the frequent and relatively long quiet moments make the firefights and mutant fights feel so much more intense. There's an entire level where all you really do is follow an NPC through a cursed metro tunnel, looking at ghosts, listening to the sounds, learning about the Metro. The pacing is excellent: neither the calm parts where you explore a friendly station or the combat-heavy levels ever feel too long.\n\nGreat game, highly recommended to anyone.","December 1, 2013","true","24.4"," 27 of 32 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","27","32","0","1"

The adventure between the tunnel and the population of the Moscow metro, devastated by a nuclear holocaust and populated by monstrous creatures, then flows without major differences or content that can diversify the offer. Given that the title of 4A Games also supports the pad, referring to the online Games for Windows Live, the advice is trivial to use mouse and keyboard, but it can reduce albeit slightly annoying situations confusing that sometimes you go to create while in the shootings more excited. If the benefits are limited to the gameplay to the control system, the real highlight of this incarnation PC is the graphics that, for the price of a certain consistency in the system requirements, offers glimpses really wonderful. The lighting, volumetric fog and the effects of post processing in particular, are able to place themselves at the top of the genus light sources projecting in the environments a substantial amount of shadows while stirring with the dust present in the air of the tunnel and the ashes of the surface, in a constant alternation of light and shadow. The character models are the same, imperfect, played on Xbox 360 even though the support for DirectX 11, if in possession of a card that supports, allows the activation of tessellation which helps to make them softer and precise. The parameters on which to work to achieve the best yield in proportion to your system are not very many because, apart from the anti-aliasing and texture filtering, adjustable by hand, there should be entrusted to a number of sets preset: da Basso up to Very High, with this step and the one preceding it distinguished from each other by use of volumetric texture sharper, higher quality shadows and bump mapping more accurate, and also other details. With all the high reading on the test PC to 1440x900 they occurred several drops of fluid with peaks down to 16-20 even frame; passing the penultimate selection menu graphic, Alto, things change dramatically and the same scenes are well above 50 frames per second. This detachment is probably because in the first case the Analytical use anti-aliasing, very exorbitant in terms of resources. Metro 2033 is not so exaggerated as required to be fully enjoyed, it becomes if you want the best, although as you can see in the photos, the detachment is minimal.

Moscow is now home to what it's people call Nosalises, Demons ("♥♥♥♥♥es" if your name is Bourbon), Librarians and more. These are mutated, radiated and otherwise newly created/modified/evolved creatures that apparently aren't fond of humans. The Nosalises are similar to large mutated mole-dogs with variants of many types ranging from flying to a rhino variant. The Demons are large flying creatures, resembling a cross with a bat/gargoyle and possible tiger. The Librarians are the real threat here; Large, muscular, haired, gorilla-looking beast that likes to snort around and bare their teeth. The developers did an amazing job with bringing these creatures to life in this game, and really letting the player know that they aren't to be trifled with. The general lack of ammo and medkits, coupled with the available frequency of encountering some of these creatures really makes you start to respect the game atmosphere and possibly cause to you be more cautious when navigating the game world to avoid certain death when you're low on ammo.\n\nThis game runs on ammunition. Ammunition is the currency of the game world, as well as your primary source of self-defense (provided you have something to shoot the bullet out of). The developers really did a great job of making the ammunition just hard enough to find on any difficulty that most players will be required to start thinking of how much they have, how much they're using and what weapons would be best to use. They also implemented some really cool weapons in the game, such as the ghetto-rigged ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ gun, which is really only good at overheating itself and using up ammo, but you'll likely encounter a time when it's all you got.\n\nThe characters in the game develop well and you can actually get to know some of them and develop a relationship/attachment to them. They all have unique personalities, even down to their names. The game spends a lot of time trying to get you acquainted with the different characters, and does a great job of it.\n\n\nThe graphics and sound are very well done. The graphics, despite being an older game, can still give newer hardware a bit of trouble due to the un-optimization of the game I believe. The world design is great, especially the moment you first step foot outside of the metro and see Moscow in the aftermath of the nuclear fallout with a Demon flying above crumbling gray buildings, Nosalises running across things and your gas mask glaring and frosting up.\n\nThis game is one of my favorites and very underrated for what it is. I certainly recommend this game.","October 28, 2015","true","0.3"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","2"

If you haven't read it yet, I can ensure it's real good\n\nMetro 2033 by Dmitry Glukhovsky on Amazon Kindle[www.amazon.co.uk]\n\nNow, the game. Many book based films/games get too biased by the producer/developer's ideas and then for the readers that becomes annoying. The book is good for some reason, so don't try to make something different from it?\nMetro 2033 though adapts the story to fit the capabilities of a videogame structure without losing any bit of the appeal of the book. In fact, it is so well outlined that you feel as if you were in the book and you were the main character that does what the narrator says. That really is an achievement by 4A Games.\n\nGraphics are very immersive. It's a 2010 game (woah, 5 years old!) but they don't have many weaker points. Certain AI character animations and 3D modelling are clearly behind any actual game, but that is all. Nvidia Physx doesn't add anything new but FPS drops. For particles in suspension (which is what Physx is set to enhance) there are pretty decent animations already. Textures are decent as well. While ice and sand textures are very basic, tunnel structures, weapons and wood are surprisingly well made. Above all it gives a good impression since the lighting is very dark so you cannot notice most bad texture-modelling issues.\n\nSystem requirements are misleading. My current GPU should support the game on higher graphics settings than it does according to the minimum/reccommended cards. That shows bad engine coding, but it will run anyway on lower resolution or without certain detail settings that won't make any difference on the quality. But hey, don't expect to reach high FPS unless you have got a top-class GPU.\n\nSince the game is only story (and what a story), the devs have polished every detail in it to get rid of ANY bug.\n\nFor sure I reccommend this game. It has some of the cons of being a 5 year old game but it's definitely worth trying.\n\n9.5/10","April 4, 2015","true","16.3"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/43110/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","975 products in account","Metro 2033 was based on a Russian novel which of course I’ve never read (like the Witcher) so I can’t tell you how closely it follows the source material. Despite being several years old, the game is technically demanding so you’re probably not going to be able to run it with integrated video hardware.\n\nIn the near future a nuclear apocalypse has occurred with the vast majority of Russia’s population wiped out and the surface world covered in radioactive fallout. The survivors live underground in the Metro, a vast subway system that now houses maybe 1000 people.  People in the game speak heavily accented English with some Russian cursing thrown in (which you may recognize if you play Dota2). It’s a harsh life underground scrounging for food and fighting for limited resources, made even worse by giant mutant rats and bandits running around killing people for their possessions. You play Artyom, a young man who is sent through the Metro to pass along an urgent message. Metro stations (mini-cities) and guard outposts are being attacked by “Dark Ones.” The Dark Ones are the bogeymen of the Metro, like stories told to frighten children. Too bad they’re real and coming to get you.\n\nMetro 2033 is a first person shooter with very good graphics and lighting effects, and a focus on post-apocalyptic underground atmosphere. Years ago when I was considering getting the game, someone told me Metro was like the STALKER games (another post-apocalyptic Russian series). This is NOT correct. STALKER is about collecting loot, wandering an open world kicking ♥♥♥ (like Fallout but you die easier). Metro 2033 is very linear and you don’t really have an inventory system. You just have weapon slots and ammo like Doom or Quake. The only real similarities are the depressing environments and atmosphere. Metro has a sort of semi stealth system where you can see how revealed you are (you want to stay in shadow) and you have a few throwing knives that can score instant silent kills. Metro also has a regenerating health system though it’s pretty slow and you don’t actually have that much health. Med kits are used to heal you to full almost instantly. If you try to blast your way through a bandit camp you’ll get squashed pretty quick.\n\nMoney in the Metro is ‘military grade rounds.’ These are regular bullets, but shinier, made before the war. You can use them as ammunition in some of your weapons to do more damage, but you’d be wasting them since they’re also your currency. Your money is spent on buying and upgrading your guns, buying consumables (grenades, knives, health packs) and just saving up for the money achievement.  You probably won’t spend too much of your money if you play stealthy anyways since you can pick your throwing knives out of dead bodies.\n\nThe game also has a kind of morality system where you score morality points by exploring the Metro and making “good” choices. It’s actually really subtle and you probably won’t even realize it’s happening unless you read about it online. The screen briefly flashes like someone took a picture when you find a “morality point.” The points add up and at the end of the game you see a different ending if you scored enough (you need A LOT, so you probably won’t get the good ending your first playthrough).\n\nAnother key element of the game is your gas mask. There are times when you must leave the Metro and go up to the surface world, where the air is toxic. When this happens you put the gas mask on, which kind of obstructs your view and hear your own heavy breathing. Every few minutes you’ll have to change the air filter or the vision starts to get clouded up. Filters are found or bought just like other consumables, and this limits the amount of time you can stay on the surface.  Another thing to note about your mask is that it can be damaged in battle. If you get shot or clawed, there’s a chance your mask will fracture or break, and you’ll need to get to safety or die (you’ll probably die). Metro is not an RPG, so don’t feel bad about running or sneaking past enemies. You don’t get any experience for kills and enemies don’t really drop money.\n\nPros:\n+Excellent atmosphere and graphics. Sometimes scary not in a BOOGA BOOGA way, but more of an OOOoooOOOOOOooo way.\n+There is a heavy “supernatural” element to the game (the Dark Ones are psychic) to add variety to your surroundings. You can also play stealth or shoot em up, but you should start each fight picking off people if you can.\n+The game has been given away free a few times and appeared in a few bundles. Not bad for an AAA game.\n\nCons:\n-For an older game the hardware requirements are intense and your computer will probably heat up while you’re playing.\n-The game is deceptively straightforward. There really isn’t much exploring or alternate paths you can take. I don’t mind this but some people might think it takes away from the experience, especially if you thought the game was going to be like Fallout or STALKER.\n\nOverall Metro 2033 is a great game and you should give it a try if you have it in your library. I haven’t tried the Redux version but I’m told it’s basically the same game with better graphics. Like I said earlier, the graphics are already really good, so don’t feel pressured to shell out money for the new and improved version, at least until the price drops.\n","September 30, 2014","true","28.3"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

You play as a guy named Artyom who has just joined the army, you begin the game just as you are going to leave the Metro, you face many challenges along the way, such as having no Ammo, or needing to sneak around areas, killing people silently. The game is very influenced by stealth, in some missions, not sneaking around will get you killed in a split second.\n\nIt is reccomended you play this BEFORE Metro: Last Light due to the games being in order, as many references to 2033 are made.\n\nThe game needs a very beefy PC to run without running it at 800x600 and low settings, but it'll pay off, the game looks perfect, better than Crysis 3 or Farcry 3, sadly there are no Advanced options or a FOV slider, but there are fixes out there, you only get the choice of a Preset for your quality, you can choose your Resoloution and DirectX version, however.\n\nThe game will last around 10 hours if played on the easiest setting and if rushed, but if played on Hardcore whilst looking around the areas can last you up to 40 hours, I recommend that it be played on Ranger mode, what Ranger mode does, is that it lowers the ammount of ammo you will find by about 90% and you will die a fair bit faster, Ranger mode is ideally the way the game was meant to be played.\n\nAll in all, the game is a perfect 10/10, good visuals, good gameplay and a great story.

The mechanics are decent, not great, you have 5 types of weapon: knife, revolver, rifle, heavy and grenades, most of them come with different modifications for example silencer or scope. A thing to note is that most of the enemies, even the beginning ones are very though, and require a lot of fire power, in some cases a whole clip is needed to take one down. The important part of the shooting is the ammo, basically there are two types of ammo, low-grade ammo which you can buy through the game so it’s plentiful but not so effective and military pre-war ammo, which is a lot better, but it’s also the currency in the game, so you can use the better ammo and kill enemies faster but then you will not have the “money” to buy other stuff (weapons, other ammo, filters for the gas mask, health packs), thus putting the player in a spot where he has to choose.\n\nThe stealth part is present, you can use the shadows to bypass enemies, destroy light sources or use your night vision goggles, but if you need to perform a stealth kill  there aren’t many ways except a silenced weapon and a headshot, hoping you kill it in the first try, also there is no way to move the bodies and the levels are pretty linear. The stealth approach is not well refined and could’ve been improved. And also stealth works best against human opponents, not so good against the mutants/monsters.\n\nWhat really impressed me about this game was the setting, the atmosphere and the story in general. Somewhere around 2009 the war (no real details are provided) starts, and Moscow is bombarded with nukes, the people take refuge in the metro system avoiding the aftermath of the bombing, the nuclear winter. The story starts years later in 2033, a new world has been created in the metro system that the survivors now call home. The surface is destroyed and inhabitable, few daring to go up anymore. All kind of weird mutants have risen that terrorize the few survivors. Along with the mutants a new threat is appearing, The Dark Ones, humanoid like creatures, that poses mind powers. Most of the technology has been lost, people having to resort to improvisation, for example most of the early guns in the game are home-made variants of real weapons, like the “♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ gun”. And of course to make things even worse part of the population is fighting each other, mostly the Reich (emulating the Nazis) and the Third Line (a communist like faction). In the middle of this post-apocalyptical scenario we have our protagonist, Artyom, who has to survive the mutant and the human threat in a effort to try and save his home station, while also displaying the power of being able to communicate with The Dark Ones.\n\nThe visuals and the audio of the game are on par, and help create and maintain the tone of the game. The graphics are nice, and being that the game is already 5 years old there is no problem running it on current systems.\n\nLength-wise the game is pretty decent, about 8 hours on normal difficulty, although you can also try a re-run on the higher difficulties where the enemy get tougher and the ammunition is scarce. There are two possible endings, but there are no major choices in the walkthrough that impact the finale, the story is the same. SPOILERS  you can get the alternative ending by simply doing "good things" like not looting corpses, not killing everybody","September 26, 2014","true","8.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

In terms of presentation the graphics on high settings still look fantastic though some of the textures upclose are a bit ugly.  The story is very gripping with a strong plot, though most of the characters suffer from a lack of development, (small spoilers) many of the npc's you meet along the 10-15 hour journey are largely forgettable and the ones that do have a unqiue personality are often killed after 10 minutes of screen time.\n\nThe gameplay side of Metro 2033 has a lot of strong points but suffers from a couple large problems regarding to the human vs human confrontations.  IMO Metro 2033 has probobly the worst stealth system I've ever played with no visual or audio prompts alerting you to wether you are about to be seen or not, also there is no silent melee takedown which makes the mandatory stealth sections just that more agrovating.  And deciding to take on the humans face to face is never a good idea as they pretty much instantly kill you on higher difficulties.  (Thankfully nearly all of these problems are fixed in the metro 2033 redux)  However aside from the overall very weak stealth gameplay the combat with the monsters is where the game is excellent, blending pulse pounding action with scary moments creates the perfect blend of immersive gameplay.\n\nIn the end Metro 2033 is a title with amazing atmosphere that is bound to keep you captivated with an intriguiging story line, and if one can put up with the annoying stealth sections Metro 2033 is a must play for all survival horror fans. (The majority of the problems mentioned in this review are fixed in the metro 2033 redux version, I strongly recommend picking up that version instead.)\n\nPresentation 8/10\nStory 8/10\nHuman vs human combat 3/10\nMonstears vs human combat 9/10\n\nOVERALL SCORE 7.5/10","November 10, 2014","true","12.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

There are many unknown elements around you, mutants, monsters and unspeakable horrors.\n\nGameplay\nTwisted abominations and everpresent radiation awaits on the surface, making it a very hazardous place to explore. Oxygen masks are required to maintain a clean air supply, and mask filters are important to gather to keep them in working order. Equipment can be damaged to the point where replacement is urgently needed or else breathing in the toxic air will surely kill you. Your environment plays a huge role and equipment is key to survival.\n\nAs it is, you won't find much safety underground either, since traps, humans, and other creatures dwell within various regions. The traps can vary from cans that whens stepped on alert the enemy to your presence or simply broken glass lying around that crunches underfoot. Turning off oil lamps decreases their visibility, allowing for a easier time sneaking past enemies. Enemies will be on high alert if they see an ally fall close to them.\n\nCurrency is based on ammunition, which has become the main source of spending power. Bullets are how you afford weapons, armors, modifications and other sources of food you will need for survival... but also your sole means of defense. Take care to keep a good balance!\n\nConclusion\nOverall I would say Metro is a great linear experience that any fan of Fallout or similar themed games can appreciate!","July 21, 2014","true","72.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","1"

A rich world with interesting mechanics, bold design, and nice gameplay. This game teases us like attractive people at gyms tying their shoes or sweating profusely (I don't actually know what attractive people do at gyms.)\n\nMetro deserves very high praise for its organic design. Presented in first person with minimal HUD: a watch indicates your gas mak filter and visibility, objectives are viewed in your journal in real time, and your gas mask can crack with damage. Little gameplay details fortify the experience: looking around becomes harder when a kid rides piggyback, staring down certain enemies deters them.\n\nThe setting feels unique, and exploring it as Artyom is fun. Most characters speak English with a Russian accent, but some Russian is spoken. The currency of miltary grade bullets (ammo made before the nuclear apocalypse) is neat, and depending on the difficulty, can make for some tough decisions. There are also some interesting"enemies" (as the nature of certain things are unclear).\n\nThe organic theme can make stealth both hard and rewarding. Stealth isn't the only way to play, but the other way is lame. Sneaking is great when the game plays fair, however the floors are littered with shards of magic glass that make all human enemies in a mile radius shoot you. They are aware that other creatures make noise and step on things, but somehow they know when you step on magic glass. Less clairvoyant enemies would've been great.\n\nMetro is one of the few games that really should have gone for a more open world feel. It would have been great to interact with characters or explore more. It was a missed oppurtunity as Artyom constantly reminds you of his connection to his home, but you never really develop that same connection.There are some really great sequences or enemies that could've been revisited, but they aren't. It's like having a table full of your great food but someone is forcing the next dish down your throat just as you were starting to savor the last. But, a game can't be bad if you are wanting more of it (of it, not from it, adpositions are important here).\n\nMinor complaints: There are some nasty bugs to watch out for (there are fixes) QTEs take over a scene near the that could've been a really great exercise in the game's organic FPS mechanics. Your character talks during loading screens, but not in game, ever; even when other characters are looking for very specific answers, your character talks about as much someone else's imaginary friend.\n\nSo the big question is, is it worth it? That is tricky. It's not your typical shooter (which is a good, we should applaud the games that try to be different in substantial ways), but it isn't perfect. So, would you rather play visionary game that mostly carries out into being a great game, or would you rather play a generic copy and paste game that is executed perfecly?.\n\n*Ranger Modes are highly recommended, as they add more realism.","August 14, 2013","true","22.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

One major dislike is that the game only has checkpoint saves, which means if you mess up, for example if you cross a checkpoint with the wrong type of ammo for the next scene, then there may be little alternative but to start again from scratch. Graphics are good, but inefficient.. This game will stress even the most powerful PC's. Also the difficultly is very unbalanced, some situations being far easier than others to deal with. There are a few of the dreaded and escort missions, which surely every gamer hates? The real strength of this game is immersive graphics and story, not so much the game-play.

However this game has many basic core functions that are fun the first time around visiting the new environments and all however it has a low replayability and I only will say that if you like a good story then this will be a good game for you. It does have fun and enjoyable and at times difficult gameplay but everything that makes this game so great to me is the atmosphere of it all. That constant worry hanging in the back of your mind.

My most bad experience was that I killed an enemy that looked like  Artyom's father lol. I would prefer a manual save system than an autosave system. It works really bad if you want to use stealth because it will sometimes just autosave on your worst moment ever :D Also same thing when you run out of filters and it goes with an autosave... :D\n\nWell, let's talk about the stealth system since I mentioned the word stealth:\nBlowing off lamps and shooting them off with silenced weapons is a nice touch and feels like Splinter Cell sometimes :) Every metallic armor parts and even the weapon may reflect bullets so you need to aim very well for an one hit kill. The game has a decent stealth system but it also has some flaws. When an enemy is on "alert state", he will sometimes just switch into "kill on sight" state and all of the nearby enemies too. Sometimes the dead scream of an enemy will alert nearby enemies :(\n\nMetro2033 is great game and also very cheap.

It feels like you are wearing a gas mask, it is cold and a hostile environment. Ammunition is scarce and military grade bullets are actually used as currency for buying and selling items. You can then choose to use the precious ammo and take down enemies easier, but suffer long term for not being able to buy the items that you might encounter during the game.\n\nThe best thing is that the game got a sequel.

The biggest fear isn't what is going on above the surface, but what is happening down below. The majority of this game takes place in the large, and vast subway abandoned system. Filled with jump scares, and creepy ambeince noise. plus whatever creatures lurk down below, you also encounter human enemies but that is just the beginning.\n\nIt's a fun game to enjoy. The controls are very easy to get use to on mouse and keyboard, but with a gamepad, it shouldn't be too diffcult. Also, this game highly suggest in indirect moments of the game, that you use your mind over your gun. Which in most cases it's true. But it's the usually "clear area, search, loot, go to next area" rinse and repeat. It can get boring for most of the time, other times, it's a life or death situation.\n\nThe visuals and artistic take on post apocalyptic Russia, is extremely beautiful, you feel just how bad the situation is for the survivors down below, making your quest much more invested in.\n\nAlways be prepared before going onto the next chapter of the game. The game will get harder if you refuse to take your ammo and supply cache seriously.\n\nOther than that I recommend this game.","January 5, 2015","true","2.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

I'm completely mad about it that i didnt see it before.\n\nThis game is definitely THE GAME you must play if you want a good authentic atmosphere. Play the Story at least 2 times with the default ending, then you will fully understand the meaning of the good (second) ending. You will reach a new level of awareness.\nIt's very tricky to get the good ending so use google or whatever.\n\n\nNOTE: IF YOU DONT UNDERSTAND THE MESSAGE I WANT TO DELIVER YOU, YOU WON'T UNDERSTAND THE MESSAGE OF THE GAME, SO DONT PLAY THIS GAME.

For a 2010 product , its graphics are better than most of the next-gen games that are released today. I was impressed by not only the voice acting , but also by the story , which really is something different. Some people will say that Fallout is a better series , but i ask them to reconsider . This is what a post-apocalyptic world should look like . Not the Mojave desert full with raiders and Brotherhood Of Steel soldiers, but the cold and snowy Russia, which is full of monsters on the surface , but populated with people trying to survive in the underground : The Metro.\nIt is true , Artyom is waaay too lucky , but he gets the job done . Also , it is sad that the devs decided to make him speak only in cutscenes . It is weird that the story reveals before you , while you're just standing there , staring at the talking people , saying how cool you were when you murdered those Nazis or those Demons.\nOverall , the game is great. It gets an 8/10 from me , because of the weird animations and the silent Artyom . Apart from those , it's a great game . A must-buy. Last Light is my next purchase.","November 12, 2014","true","7.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The amount of enemies you fight and the types of enemies all make perfect sense. The game has a great level of challenge.\n\nMy only complaint is that the stealth is missing a few mechanics that I think might be useful, like backstab kills. Other than that this game is AAA.\n\nThe story, characterse, environment and sounds are AMAZING! Do yourself a favor and pick this up.

Part Half-Life, part Fall Out, set in the Metro systems and ruins of post-apolcalyptic Moscow.  Metro's take on realism is admirable giving players an extreamly minimal HUD with no life-bar and very little else popping up.  This makes Metro easy to dive into.  Gas mask filters run out, a couple bullets can kill you even on Normal, booby traps can make you jump and underground settlements feel claustrophobic.  I highly recommend this game to anyone who wishes games like Call of Duty had more realism, tension and variety of gameplay.","December 18, 2012","true","8.1"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","3"

Good shooting.\n+ Decent survival storyline set in a futuristic Russia, when nuclear war has devastated the surface. People live underground, mutants roam throughout the metro stations and land above.\n+ Several aspects of the game are designed to be realistic, ammunition is rare so you need to conserve it. Scavenging is vital to finding new supplies. There's no health bar or timers for how long gas masks last, you need to manually check with your wristwatch. This adds to the immersion of the game.\n\nNegatives:\n\n- This game won't take long to finish, lasting an average of 15-20 hours in singleplayer.\n- Despite being acceptable, the plotline could still be more captivating.\n- Environments are very restrictive, so there's not much opportunity to explore and there's very limited side missions.\n\nOverall Score: 7/10\n\nMetro 2033 is a fun but short First Person Shooter.

They missed almost nothing. The textures are sharp and detailed, the shader effects are eye candy and I never saw a single bug. The objects, weapons and characters are very detailed and well animated. Everything gives you the feeling the developers wanted you to have. The lighting, colors and people around you will make you feel safe and protected when being at a friendly metro station while you almost can feel the cold and danger in the tunnels thanks to the proper textures and effects. Sometimes you a have to use a gasmask which will limit your field of view. You can estimate the current condition of your gasmask by watching at the cracks in the glass. You will notice that your vision gets worse due to condensed water when the filters should be changed. There are quite some interesting graphical gimmicks that actually look very nice and give you important information. The only thing that disturbed me was a really bad floor texture next to a mounted machinegun. They draw some 2D - cartridge cases onto it instead of making at least some authentic ones in 3D. There are other small things you could criticize. 9/10 is fairly realistic.\n\nSounds:     7/10\n\nYou'll only find a few tracks in Metro 2033, but their quality is quite ok. The game convinces with good weapon sounds, nice enemy/monster sounds and fitting voice actors. I have to give the game credits for the ambient noise at the stations including chatting people, working gunsmiths, crying children and guitar playing soldiers. The tunnels are quite silent. You only can hear steps from mutants/enemies, rarely some chatting guys, combat and creepy tube sounds. All in all the quality of the sounds is rather ok. Nothing special at all, but they fit the game and support the atmosphere. And one of the most honorable points: There were no annoying sounds in the whole game.\n\nGameplay/Handling/Equipment:     8/10\n\nThe controls are intuitive and easy to learn. Depending on your playstyle you may not have many combat situations. In fact you can avoid a lot of them by sneaking through the shadows, but you don't have to unless you want to get all the achievements and the "good ending" of the story (which is not the ending the sequel continues with). Throughout the game you can earn moral "points" which will decide how the game ends (good guy, bad guy). The movement is relatively slow. Even sprinting doesn't feel like being fast, but that usually doesn't matter since the game is generally rather slow than fast paced anyway. Sometimes I was annoyed by the jumping in the game. Some edges won't allow you to jump onto them and it becomes worse when you want to sneak and jump. Luckily you won't have to jump a lot so you will not face this problem that often. Let's have a look at the weapons. Some weapons are quite innovative. I personally like the pneumatic air guns which are completely quiet and kill most enemies with one shot. The common weapons like assault rifles, shotguns, grenades and revolvers work as usual. The throwing knives come in quite handy aswell when it comes to silent operations.\n\nEnemies/AI:     6/10\n\nThe human enemies act relatively authentic. They don't run into the open field, do look for cover, shoot on sight and support each other. One thing they almost never do is changing the position to get a better view at the enemy. Nevertheless the AI is really ok and fun to play against. Even the monsters work together sometimes. One is charging at you while another one is coming from behind, but usually they just come right at you. The most terrifying monsters are the librarians: They are very strong, muscular, big mutants with long arms and teeth and frightening eyes. If you don't attack them they will check if you are hostile what ends in a staring competition. 90% of the enemy mutants will be the common "Nosalis" which look like a mixture of a dinosaur and a hyena. The enemy diversity is quite low what is a wasted opportunity in my eyes.\n\nLevel design:     10/10\n\nThis is the strongest argument for playing the game. The levels are designed to give you the unique feeling of being trapped as a surivor in the metro tunnels - the only possible place you could call home. I like the whole setting. The metro levels are highly authentic and the outside world will make you feel like you are in danger all the time. The paths are usually quite logical and the level borders seem natural with some exceptions. There are a few secrets which reward your curiosity with additional equipment and ammo. Especially the last level will stay in your memory for a long time.\n\nStory:     8/10\n\nThe good news is that you'll always have a purpose to crawl through the tunnels. Your big mission might feel like a little one at first, but the story will evolve bit by bit and after solving the problems you will feel like a hero. To give you a clue: Your main mission is to deliver a report to another big metro station regarding a threat named "the dark ones". Since they don't have the option to call by phone our hero has to face the dangers of the deep, dark metro and the contaminated outside world. The developers made a relatively open ending (both endings), but I wasn't disappointed at all. Hint: Delivering the report to the other Station won't be the last action in the game.\n\nCritic summary:     8/10\n\nPersonal fun rating:     8/10     [very good game]\n\nI strongly recommend this game. The atmosphere is close to perfect and you won't face any bugs or logic problems. Sure, the game itself isn't perfect but I really enjoyed it. When I bought it, it cost around 40 bucks. I've never regretted it. If you are interested: Nowadays it's still worth 20 bucks in my opinion.","July 12, 2014","true","46.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/recommended/43110/","peterhollo","CorvusCorax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/","533 products in account","Metro 2033 is a story-driven FPS game developed by a Ukrainian team and is based on the book with the same title written by Dmitry Glukhovsky. Now, when I say story-driven it means the game does not offer multiplayer - its sequel, Metro Last Light, followed the same concept. This is an FPS game focusing on only the single player experience. To be honest this is quite rare for an FPS nowadays and this is why this game I considered a nice change considering the usual formula.\n\nIn the near future due to World War III Moscow is devastated by atomic bombs. The issue is not really with the destruction caused by the missiles but with the radiation that requires citizens to flee from the city. As the best solution a lot of people go into the depths of the Moscow underground and the game takes place a couple of decades later when there is already an established society down there. Supplies and resources are scarce and not only are the survivors threatened by the mutants that were born as a result of the catastrophe but also by the evil of men which resurfaces as some decide to apply some good old ideologies that were meant to remain vanished. Factions are born and our protagonist, Artyom, finds himself between these two who are waging war against one another. And while the mutant animals also pose a threat there is a mysterious new race only referred to as the Dark Ones who occasionally appear to decimate each side.\n\nSo, with Artyom you fight all these people in the subways. This gives the gameplay an interesting touch - sometimes the enemies just consist of mutants. You go through dark corridors with creepy atmosphere and you see holes everywhere and you're wondering when and how many monsters will jump at you all at once. Other times its all about the factions - you fight against people and these levels let you take them head-on or follow a more stealthy approach.\n\nYou have a knife at your disposal so that you can take down the enemies silently and from a safe distance. Your foes, however, are not stupid - they employ a handful of traps and you should deactivate these otherwise you are in for a not very nice surprise. Later on you will do all this on the surface - you leave the underground world only to find yourself in a poisonous world. You have a gas mask and limited oxygen supply and you quickly need to reach your objective before time runs out.\n\nThe 4A Engine does a wonderful job. Every place, every corridor, every enemy looks very detailed. The game is mostly dark so the lighting you have here is excellent. You can shoot light bulbs to make the place darker and be able to approach your foes for a takedown. While the game looks stunningly good you cannot really be positive when it comes to its optimisation. Even with today's PC hardware the game can produce a lower than 60 FPS. It is an issue only because the game's sequel uses the same engine but looks and runs better. Also, the game does not allow you to change the graphics settings one by one but just provides you with a preset option. More freedom in this would have provided players with more room for tweaking and eventually a smoother gameplay experience.\n\nThe game can, at times, be very challenging which is good for FPS veterans. An extra challenge comes in the form of the so-called Ranger Mode. This mode tries to make the game more realistic - bullets can kill Artyom much easier but the same goes for the enemies. Also, Heads-Up Display is completely disabled. Obviously, this difficulty means you should further focus on the stealth approach as when human enemies are around running and gunning is not an option.\n\nThe game has two endings. One is considered bad while the other is the good way to finish the game. The latter requires you to obtain a lot of moral points. These can be obtained in various ways - you talk to people or you simply listen to all conversations, you give bullets to beggars (bullets are the in-game currency), you do not accept rewards, you play musical instruments found throughout the game etc. The downside in all this is that the game never really explains the mechanics here. You can only guess what is going on as at times the screen flashes brightly to indicate you have just gained a moral point. Also, there are no score or statistics screen telling you how many points you have obtained and how many remain to be found. I was not able to complete this so I always got the bad ending (which is considered canonical when it comes to the game's sequel).\n\nI liked Metro. I found it a unique experience with its dark, creepy tunnels and dead city and hordes of mutants. I liked to participate in Artyom's desperate journey to find his station help from the people living in Polis, the greatest station of all. The people who belong to the council and who can make decisions that can change the lives of the denizens of Metro. This was a long journey and I enjoyed every minute of it.","March 26, 2014","true","19.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Here's what I think:\n\nStory: 8.5/10\nI haven't played Last Light yet, but the story in this game is fairly engrossing. It's post-apocalyptic Russia where everyone takes refuge in the subways and monsters have appeared on the irradiated surface. They've been making their way into the subway and now threaten the human survivors there. Also, nazis! Every single character is completely forgettable except for  Bourbon, who you learn about through interactions with other NPCs as you travel together but is otherwise totally unimportant to the story.\n\nThe bloodthirsty and shortsighted quality of the nuclear warfare that destroyed the planet is a recurring theme in the game, which I was pleased to see. You can get two different endings based off of "morality points" that are collected throughout the game in ways that might surprise you (and sometimes definitely don't). The idea that destruction and death are sinful and that there is an ultimate but not obvious price to paid for one's bloodlust is tied into a lot of the sequences and decisions in the game and it's really cool to see a story that explores them in a nuanced and careful fashion, rather than shoving it down your throat. There are some dream-like sequences that are really cool to play through as well.\n\nAesthetics: 9/10\nThis game is absolutely gorgeous. And not just because the graphics are good; many objects and models are incredibly detailed and some level of thought to the overall atmosphere was given to every single point in the game. The enemies are really, really creepy, especially the ones near the last third of the game. The way you track your filters, charge your electronics, pump your pneumatics, and other little interactions with the wold are all very detailed and atmosphere-appropriate. I'm not a huge fan of post-apocalyptic grunge-scapes but the way they presented these subways and the above-ground areas are really just stunning, and I'd recommend you see for yourself.\n\nThe sound is good, I didn't notice anything really stellar about it but it wasn't bad either. Some sound effects seemed a little low-quality or just bad, but the stereo image was very nice overall.\n\nit would be a 10/10, but there are plenty of glitches that kill the immersion - sometimes looking at your watch makes the whole screen blurry instead of just the background, dead monster corpses look more alive than living monsters most of the time, somtimes monsters sound like they're right behind you when really they're behind a wall, sometimes (with 2-handed guns) your extra hand bobs out of sync with the gun and it looks really dumb. There's a bunch of stuff like that but it didn't bother me enough to keep me from enjoying all the things about the game that are great.\n\n\nGameplay: 7/10\nUnfortunately, gameplay is where this game really falls short. Shooting mechanics feel blimpy and unresponsive, guns are in no way balanced, scripted sequences depend on you to be standing in or beyond a certain point and can make for some really stupid moments, and some sequences seem a little poorly planned in general.\n\nAlso, the amoebas. I don't know how or why, but they are enemies you will only encounter in a single spot right near the end of the game for what appears to be no particular reason, and they are so insanely frustrating that it just doesn't fit with the rest of the game. You're stuck with an AI npc who can take a lot of damage but isn't invincible and does nothing to avoid being hit. The blobs come out of pink holes in the ground that can be destroyed by gunfire, which makes absolutely no sense. I had to find that out by looking online. The blobs are numerous and it only takes one or two to kill you, depending on the difficulty. But even if you kill them, they still leave behind harmful residue, just not as much. You need to stay far away from your companion in order to survive because he can and will take ten times more damage than you can possibly handle, but at a later point in the game you will be insta-killed by monsters as a punishment for getting too far away. Really, it's just so, so dumb. It stands out sorely as a low point in this game but luckily only lasts very briefly.\n\nAlso the AI is atrocious. Stealth is almost impossible because hit boxes are also atrocious, and as I'm sure you've heard if it takes two throwing knives to kill someone instead of one, the whole level immediately begins firing at you even if your victim never made a peep. There are also portions where stealth is impossible, which makes the fact that the game forces you to choose between a 'stealth-suit' and an 'armor-suit' halfway through the plot seem really stupid.\n\nAll that being said, the game is still pretty fun. Shooting things can be fun if you get the right weapons and collect enough ammo, exploring is a blast, and the game does really do a good job of immersing you, depending on how sensitive you are to minor gripes like mine above.\n\nOverall - 9/10\nIn my opinion, this game really comes together to be more than the sum of its parts. It's clunky and badly optimized on the one hand, but on the other hand it's a truly artistic endeavor and as a consumer, it's really a pleasure to experience. I'll definitely be giving this one another play through.","February 17, 2015","true","27.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Yes AI are dumb at times and don't match up to par of what is being said but still that is nothing giving away from the gameplay. Presentation is outstanding and graphics are really eye dropping for how old it is but my old problem with the game is the blood it feels... Too watery and run down and just stands out might be because i'm running AMD but it doesn't matter. Gameplay is enjoyable at times when it saves you not that far after you where killed I had to change the game difficulty to EASY and still was being murder around every corner. Good news sometimes I wasn't that far back from what I did before I died and other times it varied so I give it 50/50 on being good saving. No there is no manual saving before you ask. Story sets up alright goes looking for someone his friend told him to go look for and progress into a go do this i'll get you here type story for most of it but it was enjoyable considering the environment and atmosphere in the metro tunnels and above ground kept it refreshing while mowing down some mutants. All in all game is pretty good the only thing sets apart are it god like eniemes and the blood being a little too run down it gets a 8.5/10 soild but just little things that do matter.","December 31, 2013","true","11.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It's dark and moody which adds a certain tension to the game. It also looks great in motion, apart from the faces. The faces could use some extra work, but thankfully most of the NPC's you meet have helmets on so it keeps you (mostly) immersed.\n\nThe fact that you can use ammo for your weapons or as a way to trade for stuff is a great idea, and gives the player a sense of freedom. That's all the freedom there is though; the game is quite linear. I honestly expected the game to be a bit more open. After all: you're walking around in the underground, you're frequently being shown a map of this very underground, but unfortunately, the game keeps you from exploring any of the tunnels that are not part of the story.\n\nThere are also a few stealth levels. These levels don't work as well as you would expect. I had to restart quite a few times. The game's just not build for this sort of gameplay. Then again, it's only a few levels so it's not a big deal. But still worth mentioning.\n\nMetro 2033 was a pleasant surprise for me. I'm glad I finally decided to finish it, after a 2 year long backlog delay ;)\n(Also, the game's framerate is all over the place. I had to change it to DX9 in order for it to give me a stable framerate.

Like the STALKER games, it does a lot of things wrong (the ♥♥♥♥ing bad checkpoint system), but the flaws add to its depth and charm.

The sounds, the graphics and the gameplay is super cool and creepy. When you walk around in a station you can hear all kind of storys. The tank that was dugd into the ground, the submarines that stayed at their posts or attacked when the first bombs fell to take revenge for their families. There is a lot of exploration for a FPS, but tha game is not that long. 12 - 15 hours depending on how much you explore or what difficulty you have. Wish leads to the ranger mode where you have no crosshair and die much more easily! This is a game that you can, with no problem, play multiple times. The endings are really satisfying and they are not in your face. Most games would put two giant signs, one red and one blue, but in metro you actually have to think and react fast.

Creepy noises and a desolate setting filled with mutated monsters that want to eradicate/eat the last of the human race strangely adds to engaging me even more. Combat and adventures are hard and only the most hardcore types should start their first time around on anything but easy. Ammo is limited so you have to scrounge or get used to fighting with your knife which only makes it scarier. Monster noises are the scariest especially when you've got ten bullets left in your pistol and no healing packs. Ask me how I know that. Heh.\n\nThe game is sometimes linear but for those with limited time you can finish this game in ten to fifteen hours tops.

Other than Fallout 3 I have yet to play a game with atmosphere this palpable and real, or characters that seem so believable. Combat is pretty good as well, but feels a bit Modern Warfare-ish (i.e. spray-and-pray with a bit of sneak). The reason that I emphatically recommend this game to Fallout 3 fans is because Metro 2033 differs from Fallout by offering a more focused narration. Yet Metro 2033 compares to Fallout 3 by existing in a semi-plausible, post apocalyptic world where individual survival is not only paramount, it also acts as a force in the plot. I have played only a few other games that provide this much tension and atmosphere. Two thumbs up, if you can handle it.","November 18, 2011","true","15.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You wander round in the squalor of the crowded metro stations, crawl through the filth of the tunnels, and try to survive on the irradiated surface in dust-choked Moscow. The currency of the game are military-grade bullets, which are also extremely effective at killing things! You can trade your military bullets for cheaper bullets, or you can metaphorically shoot your money away. And you need to keep a supply of gas mask filters outside of the metro stations or else you'll choke to death.

The story was enjoyable, with some interesting characters, like Bourbon, Khan and Ulman; however, I didn't like the endings: they make no sense, and I don't think Artyom would choose either one, not to mention following Miller's insane plan without saying a word. His muteness throughout the game is beyond my comprehension, he should have said something at least to the kid he takes with him at one point. The setting is certainly very atmospheric with the run-down metro stations, the half-collapsed tunnels and that AK-74 ammo is the money, but, unfortunately, it makes very little sense. There is no way these monsters could have evolved in just 20 years (it's at most their 6th generation), I don't know what they could eat in a permanent winter, I can't believe the survivors could find enough uncontaminated water, I wonder where they get electricity from, and AFAIK .44 caliber revolvers are not used in Russia.\n\nThe game mechanics are also a mixed bag. I really liked the crudeness of the homebrew weapons, the intense stealth missions, and it's an interesting twist that the game gives achievements for not killing the nazis. There are some odd features, though: the throwing knife kills silently, but the normal knife doesn't, Artyom has to change filters in the gasmask every 5 minutes, yet there are people who practically live on the surface, and filters can only be bought in the first two stations. The checkpoint system without the ability to save manually adds tension to the gameplay, but it also discourages experimentation, especially on the surface, where filter time is very limited.","November 26, 2013","true","51.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The devs of 4A Games do a far over the top job when it comes to atmosphere. As many of you might know, the setting is around the complex post-apocalyptic metro system of Moscow with a few surface missions ( streets of Moscow, library, etc ) and the game manages to catch you in its horrendous monster and "bandit" infested tunnels, holes and streets of Moscow.\nThe whole amtospheric aspect is underlined by lovely details on every corner of the game: The artistic style and how the Metro is designed are just amazingly breathtaking. The (wide variety of) enemies  (with their specific weaknesses and skills) seem realistic and you are mostly able to choose the stealth or guns blazing approach when it comes to humans. Weapons feel great and even though you only can carry three firearms at a time, there is a choice in weaponry and even customization. Whatever tingles your senses - be it surpressor, scopes, shotguns, rifles, pistols, even a air pressure based gun and so on.\nThe game manages to be everything you want to see in a post-apocalyptic story-telling endeavour. There is a slight aspect of exploration in this game, but that fact does not make it less of what it is. An interesting piece of art which features factions ( reds, faschists, civilians and some sort of militia ), weapon customization, the feeling of being alone in the tunnels and still feeling haunted at every step, a dark secretive story, replayability (for me it was 3-4 times), amazing level design and diversive gameplay (which might be a result of very little scripting!).\nWith all this positive aspects there are just far too little (linearity, sometimes throwing waves of enemies at you) things to not recommend and give it an A1 rating!\nFor me it is a game that deserves 9.5/10 and I am not being generous, I am being honest!

The graphic and lighting may not be as advanced as in Redux version, but honestly the Redux version's lighting is just too saturated, and some of the inanimate objects, corpses, and other structure parts just randomly glows ?, uhm redux,,,,. if you want to play Metro 2033, play this version of the game.\n\nWeapons: As mentioned above, there's choises you can make, that will have an impact to what may happen in the ending of the game'' ops that was a spoiler,'' anyways there's not much to say about the weapons beside there's arms dealers that in diferent levels of the game will offer to sell you differnte weapons some that may suit a stealthy play style some that will suit a more head on fire fighting type of play style, but the thing I actually wanted to bring in here is, that there's little hidden stashes of weapon, ammo and supplies around the map, don't rush thru the game just to finish . you'll miss out on the good stuff :). oh by the way . Volt Driver, dont leave that behind, highly recommend you keep that weapon once you get one, the shots from it is almost instant kill to all human enemy, and often instant kill for a lot of the mutant enemies as well.\n\nAmmo: If you use the Smg or Assault riffles in the game as your main weapon, then you may want to make each bullet count or buy the low quality cartrages, ''millitary grade'' ammo can be hard to find when you need them the most, so make each shoot count !, Highly recommend shooting calmly with revolver instead of AR or SMG, or just keep your Volt Driver and use that as main weapon. :)\n\nOther Supplies like Med kits / Health Kit, Granades, Throwing knives, Filters etc.\noften located around the map near corpses of unfortunate others who got killed, but watch out for little arrows painted all over the place, and tripwire traps, those can be indication to hidden stashes of ammo, filters, med kits and more.","February 19, 2015","true","107.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","2"

I bought that game just for 1,99 Euros? Steam just gone mad!"\n\nThis is one of the most beautifully designed game of the FPS genre ever. And you really can see it. When you play it for first few days, you won't see the difference between this game and other FPSs. But you won't see it, because it is going to be the only game you will play that week. Then, when you play some CoD, you will feel it like technological backwardness. And when you will compare it with today's graphics masterpieces, you won't believe how old this game is. That's for the garphics.\nIf you ask about sound, it's awesome, the people and monsters (and other ♥♥♥♥, you hear) are making very believable noises, like screaming, tone of their voice capture the situation, you are at. And soundtrack? Oh, right I almost forgot, because I don't remember it. As you hearing and seeing all the beauty, you won't even know there is some soundtrack. It makes you feel as you are really the Artyom (main propagonist of the game).\nYeah, and story. Amazing, just amazing. When I'm reviewing game, I can't forget to say something about story. Unfortunanently the story is so great, I don't want to spil you, guys. Pergaps you've read the original book. Perhaps you haven't.

I've been waiting for this game for a really long time. Luckily my rig allows me to play Dx10 on either High or Very High Settings. I was switching in between both since FPS falls in certain maps\n\nThis is truly an experience of a lifetime. As I was playing, I frequently noticed that my jaw was open - much like those brain dead 14-year old zombie kids playing Modern warfare and such all day long.\n\nI haven't read the book, but definitely should now.\n\nIm extremely happy that I can actually play this game in the original, in Russian language, since I speak it. And I recomment it to anyone wanting to experience the game in its purest form, of course the English subtitles can be enabled.\n\nWhat else? well the specs pretty much kick your a$$. Games like these demand respect. This isnt the 6 year old STALKER engine however, but it delivers. All I need is a GTX 480 which only comes out on March 26 - this game "recommends" that you play it with that card!\n\nThe sound is awesome, you can hear the distant growlings of the beasties as well as some distant firefights. However, the main character seems so talkative in loading screens, however he is a total mute in cut scenes and dialogue in general - I hate that in games. One of the very few games that actually pulled off character development with simple dialogue or monologue from the main character is Max Payne 1 and 2. Is it really that hard?\nThe graphics - well, I believe that with the exception of facial textures, the graphics are actually better than in Crysis, but I could be wrong\nThe gameplay - feels a bit consolish, especially the movement of the gun, you'll know what I mean. I also wished to see bigger maps and do more exploring.\nNo check points - which is a good thing, makes your life harder.\nThe AI - could use a little work. The beasties are pretty easy to kill. I finished the game on the hardest difficulty and did not find much trouble killing every beastie even when the ammo ran out. I sometimes found myself running around the beasties and slashing them with a knife - it doesn't always help, but its useful to conserve as much ammo as possible\nPlaying in 3D - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Go NVIDIA\nThe story - nearly perfect with some good twists, with the exception of *****SPOILER ALERT******\n-ghosts- yeah, there are "ghosts" in the game. Come on....there are no ghosts\n\nI really hope that they make a similar game like this in the near future. I cant believe that I beat it already.\na word of advice, do NOT rush through this game, feel every meter of the tunnels, listen to every sound, enjoy every texture and bit of a dialogue, and see your jaw drop...\n\nwhat I did find a bit annoying is how much the actual book was advertised in the game - you'll know what I mean.\n\nIt's also pretty wierd why gamers who like and dislike the game say that the game is too linear. I said that too, just as a matter of fact, but aren't 90% of FPS games are linear? why should this one be the exception? All of Call of Duty games are linear, but no one is complaining about that.\n\nThe minor minuses are:\n-You play as a mute character\n-You cast no shadow and you have no legs so you are just a couple of arms floating around\n-The bodies of the down enemies and monsters disappear quickly thus ruining the immersion.\n-More NPC models are needed\n\nbtw. I have recognized at least two voices from the dudes who are doing a voiceover for many stalkers in STALKER :)\nGet this game, and keep it.","January 4, 2011","true","92.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/43110/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Every so often a game will come completely out of nowhere. It slides in right under the radar and manages to take you totally by surprise. These games are often made by new or up and coming development studios that most people really don't pay enough attention to and yet they manage to make games like Darksiders. The most recent game sleeper hit is definitely Metro 2033, a game that initially looked like a cheesy little b-horror movie inspired first person shooter but turned out to be a fair bit more than that.\nEarth was destroyed years ago in a war of some sort that has left the world (or at least Russia) a radioactive mess. Those Russians who survived the war have abandoned the surface entirely due to this, choosing to instead make their home in the subway system that ran underneath their homeland. Due to this the surface has become infested with a new form of life; various mutants who have evolved to survive on the radioactive surface, flying through the skies or even harassing the humans underground. Stepping into this mess is our hero, Artyom, and through his ill-fated promise the player will be thrust into this strange new world.\nOn its surface Metro 2033 is a fairly typical example of the FPS genre with the notable exception that it's very story driven. Some might think to compare it to Fallout 3 but these are two very different games. You won't be doing any levelling up or assigning skill points in Metro 2033. The extent of your ability to modify your character is limited to choosing different weapons or weapons with different attachments.\nConsidering the fact that the world has been blown to smithereens and weapons are built with whatever is at hand you will get most of your equipment from scavenging. The currency of the world is military-grade ammunition, well crafted ammo from before the war, and you will have to find these valuable cartridges. Most of these will be from dead bodies whether it's the frozen long dead or warm bodies of your own creation but others can be found lying around in various locations. With this currency you can either buy "dirty bullets", weaker and cheaper ammunition manufactured by residents of the Metro as well as various guns. At one point you can even buy a new suit of armour, increasing your defences or sneaking abilities. It's not so much character customization as weapon load-out management.\nAs you travel the lonely tunnels of the Metro, scavenging for bullets and equipment off of the dead bodies you will notice just how claustrophobic this game is. Much of your time is spent travelling the lonely tunnels with only the mutants for company. At best you may have a single companion to guide you along but even these moments are tense affairs fraught with mutant chases or sightings of ghostly images in the tunnels. Sometimes the things you think you see out of the corner of your headlamps light is more disconcerting than the enemy that's bearing down on you. Even when there are no actual threats in the dungeons you can still find yourself jumping at shadows.\nEscaping to the surface is no consolation whatsoever because of its own manner of oppression. Due to the radiation that is blighting the land you will need to wear your gas mask at all times while above ground. Even though you will have to wear it at times while underground in hazardous areas you must wear it at all times above ground and it wears on you. Listening to Artyom's gasping as his filters run low, scavenging desperately for more filters from dead bodies and frantically fending off enemies so they don't shatter your mask on you all add up to make some of the most tense moments in recent video game memory.\nMaking matters yet worse, the skies are ruled by foul beasts that will stalk you if you don't hide from them. This turns certain areas of the surface into cat and mouse games and you are, unfortunately, the mouse. Paired up with the mutant attacks it means you will never feel safe on the surface. That's not even getting into what other things wait for you inside of some of the remaining buildings.\nBut the game doesn't try to coast on atmosphere alone; there is a solid game here. Considering that almost all of the guns are made of scavenged materials they're not exactly the most reliable things in the world. Accuracy tends to be a bit on the iffy side for much of the game - Although it will always land within your targeting reticule it's sometimes a bit hard to judge exactly where it will land.\nAll of this atmosphere wouldn't mean a thing if the rest of the experience didn't add up. Luckily, for a smaller Ukrainian video game outfit, the guys at 4A Games have done a stellar job.\nWhile the graphics aren't necessarily the greatest to ever grace us, they are more than suitable to the job especially considering most of the game is in near darkness. It's surprising just how good everything looks even under a scrutinizing eye. The only thing that's a bit lackluster are the human animations which can be on the robotic at times but you won't really notice since most humans you see are enemies and you will have more on your mind at these times.\nThe sound is something of a mixed bag when it comes to the voice acting but never where building atmosphere is concerned. Much of the voice acting was done by local talent which means you're listening to people talking with heavy accents. These don't always sound very convincing when speaking English, some of the inflections are off or the dialogue sounds like it's being read from a script. But where the atmosphere is concerned this always excels.\nMetro 2033 is an incredibly chilling game experience. Many of the sections in the game aren't very difficult to get through, even on the hardest difficulty, but they will have you jumping at shadows nonetheless. There's just a sense of overwhelming dread that follows much of this experience that it's almost tempting to qualify this as a survival horror game.","March 16, 2014","true","58.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SirSkrathIV/recommended/43110/","SirSkrathIV","Imp","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SirSkrathIV/","147 products in account","Metro 2033 is a game that can only be classified as "Somewhat horror, post apocalyptic, FPS" which I will explain how makes this game entirely perfect to an extent. It all mixes and matches with one another because the Post Acolyptic gives the game a good horror atmosphere, with the ability to throw in low ammo and gun fights making you think about every shot. "Want to shoot that Fascist? Let me check my ammo. Nope, gotta use this knife." Is what you will think often at one point in the game. The Tunnels will give you the feel of dread, and not knowing what's next. When you are in the tunnels you might be perfectly fine one second, and then hear a scream come from what you believe is another being in the tunnels. It wasn't anyone else, it was the pipes. The pipes sing to you, or so is said. The atmosphere is great. +9 Rating\n\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nLet's start with the guns. There really aren't very many different guns, but different combinations of guns with gun modifications. There's a Revolver which you can find with a silencer, or a rifle stock. You've got your trusty knife, there's 2 different types of grenades, 2 different types of shotguns, 2 different Pnuematic guns, and atleast 4 different types of Assault Rifle. I could say this is a bad thing, but it isn't. It's a really good thing actually. If you were living in the Metros of a post apocalyptic world do you think there would be 70+ Guns with 150+ Modifications each? No. This small amount of guns also gives you the chance to find what you like most, want a really silent gun that you're less likely to get caught due to sound? Go for a silenced weapon, or pnuematic. Want a loud gun that doesn't tons of damage and will rid of people for you to loot ammo? Grab that shotgun, or get an assault rifle. +7 Rating\n\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThere isn't a very large cast of voice actors as most of the time you will hear the same voice on a different face repeatedly, that can get quite annoying at times. Honestly it is very annoying. The cast of characters though, is what makes it worth while. A lot of the enemies are voiced by the same person, but have very different fighting styles. I fought bandits who would try running down halls to gun me down, then I fought communists who jumped behind cover to fire at you, and finally I fought Fascists who were set up at a "check point" as they call it with a heavy machine gun firing at you until you could finally make it to them and slaughter them, riddling each body with bullets. This doesn't count the mutants that I've fought (Nosalis, Rats, Demons, Etc) Who normally have the bandits fighting style. +12 Rating\n\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThis is one of the only games that I can say I fell in love with the story in, I mean I even bought the book just to read the story again without the ability to control some things. You are Artyom, a young man who is leaving his station (Where you live) to go to Polis to get help and warn the others of the Dark ones. Along the way you see that not everyone had it as good as you did in your station that was free from the dangers of Communism, Fascism, death, Nosalis, Starvastion, Etc. Your station on the contrary though is the only one that had to deal with the Dark Ones for a while. You learn that while in your station, everyone gets a fair share of food to eat, and tea to drink in another station a young boy would have to beg for a few bullets to buy medicine for his father, or to get a drink to keep living through Dehydration. You learn that the fascists slaughter anyone mutated, or too different. The Communists seem like a good people, but they keep spys everywhere. What you can say where you live can't always be said in other stations. You learn of children that had to watch their mothers and fathers get eaten alive by Nosalis and all they could do was run. +9\n\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nI leave the review ending her with a final score of 37/50. I hope I influenced you on whether or not you should buy this game.","April 20, 2014","true","38.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I've been waiting for this game for a really long time. Luckily my rig allows me to play Dx10 on either High or Very High Settings. I was switching in between both since FPS falls in certain maps\n\nThis is truly an experience of a lifetime. As I was playing, I frequently noticed that my jaw was open - much like those brain dead 14-year old zombie kids playing Modern warfare and such all day long.\n\nI haven't read the book, but definitely should now.\n\nIm extremely happy that I can actually play this game in the original, in Russian language, since I speak it. And I recomment it to anyone wanting to experience the game in its purest form, of course the English subtitles can be enabled.\n\nWhat else? well the specs pretty much kick your a$$. Games like these demand respect. This isnt the 6 year old STALKER engine however, but it delivers. All I need is a GTX 480 which only comes out on March 26 - this game "recommends" that you play it with that card!\n\nThe sound is awesome, you can hear the distant growlings of the beasties as well as some distant firefights. However, the main character seems so talkative in loading screens, however he is a total mute in cut scenes and dialogue in general - I hate that in games. One of the very few games that actually pulled off character development with simple dialogue or monologue from the main character is Max Payne 1 and 2. Is it really that hard?\nThe graphics - well, I believe that with the exception of facial textures, the graphics are actually better than in Crysis, but I could be wrong\nThe gameplay - feels a bit consolish, especially the movement of the gun, you'll know what I mean. I also wished to see bigger maps and do more exploring.\nNo check points - which is a good thing, makes your life harder.\nThe AI - could use a little work. The beasties are pretty easy to kill. I finished the game on the hardest difficulty and did not find much trouble killing every beastie even when the ammo ran out. I sometimes found myself running around the beasties and slashing them with a knife - it doesn't always help, but its useful to conserve as much ammo as possible\nPlaying in 3D - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Go NVIDIA\nThe story - nearly perfect with some good twists, with the exception of *****SPOILER ALERT******\n-ghosts- yeah, there are "ghosts" in the game. Come on....there are no ghosts\n\nI really hope that they make a similar game like this in the near future. I cant believe that I beat it already.\na word of advice, do NOT rush through this game, feel every meter of the tunnels, listen to every sound, enjoy every texture and bit of a dialogue, and see your jaw drop...\n\nwhat I did find a bit annoying is how much the actual book was advertised in the game - you'll know what I mean.\n\nIt's also pretty wierd why gamers who like and dislike the game say that the game is too linear. I said that too, just as a matter of fact, but aren't 90% of FPS games are linear? why should this one be the exception? All of Call of Duty games are linear, but no one is complaining about that.\n\nThe minor minuses are:\n-You play as a mute character\n-You cast no shadow and you have no legs so you are just a couple of arms floating around\n-The bodies of the down enemies and monsters disappear quickly thus ruining the immersion.\n-More NPC models are needed\n\nbtw. I have recognized at least two voices from the dudes who are doing a voiceover for many stalkers in STALKER :)\nGet this game, and keep it.","January 4, 2011","true","92.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

His station makes the best mushroom tea which allows his station to survive. That's his job, to grind mushrooms into powder. He then catches a ride to the next station to deliver the mushroom tea powder along with other things. (That's how his journey starts off. The game doesn't go into any detail.)\n\nBuy the book, it's so much better than the game.\n\nThe game is alright, kind of just average though. It doesn't seem so much based on the book as it is loosely following the story of the book.\n\nA lot of content from the book is missing and it makes this game feel really short.\nThe book actually made it seem like a whole week to get to the tower but this game makes it seem like a few hours. Point is you'll need to read the book to know what's going on.\nOne of the benefits of this game is that you can see what the creatures actually look like.\n\nThe game is also really rough around the edges. Few bugs and glitches. It's as buggy as it is gritty.\nPolis if you're unaware is the capital of the Metro and in the book it's described as this massive place with shops, a bustling market, loads of tents and lights so bright that outsiders have to wear sunglasses.

Metro 2033 is one of those games that allows and does quite well of making you feel like your in the universe. It does very well when putting emphasis on the word "Atmostpheric". During the game I felt so closely related with the game, I often just shouted Artyom! I knew myself I would love this game by the start. I often overlook games, but this time due to it being a novel before a game I knew I had to pick it up while it was on sale. I never found one area where metro 2033 did bad in. I recently just finished this title then I went on to metro last light. And I have to say there is a amazing storyline in both of these games. I cant stress how much you must play this game. The first will make you crave more, The second will make you cry.","July 17, 2014","true","21.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/snortcannon/recommended/43110/","snortcannon","Snort Cannon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/snortcannon/","1320 products in account","Metro 2033 is a Post Apocalyptic Shooter in the style of Fallout just without the Rpg Stuff But will you want to play ths or just go to Fallout. In Metro 2033 you play as Artyom. He and the most population of Russia are living in the metro because all of theyre homes are destroyed by a post apocalyptic event. People Suffer mutations and turn into monsters. But among the monster theres a race called the dark ones. Artyom thinks of them as a threat so he ventures beyond the metro station where he grew up to warn people of the threat that are the dark ones. So how is Metro 2033 ? Its one of the best games on steam as of now. It plays like a normal shooter but there are elements that make it original. You have to conserve youre ammo because its gonna you will hav a limited amount of it. Youre inventory runs of a portable battery which you have to pump to keep youre equipment alive. You also have a gas mask because the outside air is now poison so you need to keep a mask with you at all times. Now the game looks amazing and if you have a titan PC its one of the best looking games Period. The game is quite fun but there are a few problems that haunt it. The game Gets quite tough near the end of it and it might throw some people off. The game also is quite confusing to navigate because even though its linear its also quite open for you to explore. There are alot of Bugs to this game as well so beware. Overall Metro 2033 is a game you need to own and play because its amazing. I give Metro 2033 a 9/10","August 13, 2014","true","7.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

The dangerous environments, as well as having to fight the enemies in near darkness at times, just adds to the difficulty.  But the game certainly keeps you on your toes!  I'm still learning the bullet exchange system (bullets are used as currency in the game).  My only complaints are that there isn't a real obvious "health meter" so rationing the first aid kits can be a challenge; it's pretty obvious when your character gets injured...but the extent of the injuries isn't always immediately obvious.  Also, since the game takes place in Moscow, all the characters have thick Russian accents which can be hard to understand at times (especially when wearing a gas mask), but the subtitles take care of that problem pretty easily.  But, yeah, fun game; definitely worth checking out.","December 4, 2013","true","16.1"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

"Nice horror-survival game. Not so scary tho...".\n\nIt felt like it was the time to redo my review.\n\nAfter reading the book, I can say that the game is almost as good as the book was. The book brought chills down my spine everytime I opened it to continue reading (I created an atmosphere for better immersion, dark outside and only a lamp's light shining on a wall next to me).\n\nThe game sends that same message, it makes you feel vulnerable, if not helpless. When you have almost no ammo left and only a few breaths left in the gas mask's filter and find yourself on the outside, where no one can hear or help you, you must take care not to panic and think really fast about how to use the resources.\n\nThis game is very story-driven and it shows the dark truth of what would happen in a post-apocaliptic world, where men would fight each other over supplies and then go back just to fight the Dark Ones.\n\n2033/2034 would love to play it again, without already knowing the story.","December 18, 2014","true","24.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The easy difficulties give you a more relaxing way to look at the environment and settings, while the harder difficulties keep you on edge with harder-to-find ammunition and items.\n\nThis game took well off the novel of the same name.

It is insanely addicting to me. The struggle for ammo is real, and adds tension to the air by the second. Best last resort is your knife, I had to do this in the intro with Hunter because they only gave you like 10 or so bullets for your Revolver on Ranger Easy. (This was the second playthrough, mind you.) However, I've never broken a mask, so I can't tell you what that's like. I'm sure its terrifying.\n\nIf your a fan of post-apocalyptic games, this one is definitely for you. The main currency of the game are old Military-Grade rounds, for God's sake. The patchwork of the weapons early on sell it even more. I swear, the Double-Barrel is made of tin cans.\n\nI'm looking forward to playing Metro: Last Light for this Christmas.

You could do any strategy in this game you want, envisioning yourself into Artyom's frame of mind and control, from going to stealth, to bashing someone's skull into the wall, or making gunshots in the middle of a whole wave of enemies.

There's a lot of very, very interesting elements that the game touches on, things that I would definitely like to see revisited in a later game.\n\nThe game's not perfect, especially with regards to its stealth combat system, which will have you reloading saves over and over. This is especially true since every single silent weapon has a chance of being deflected by items worn by NPCs, stupid things like a throwing knife being deflected by a rubber gas mask.

I was continually interested in the progression of my character, and the world around him. I didn't have much a say of Artyom, he wasn't a silent protagonist as much as he was a defined person - but I was interested in him, and I felt my actions helped shape him in slight.\n\nStealth is the required way to play the game, running and gunning with enough bullets to decimate a third world country will likely ruint he feeling of the game.

Napeta, teskobna i deprimirajuća, ekranizacija romana Dimitrija Glukovskog donosi jedno drugačije igračko iskustvo, koje se pre može okarakterisati kao epska akciona avantura nego kao klasičan FPS. Akcenat ovde nije na napucavanju sa hordama neprijatelja (iako i toga ima u solidnoj meri), već na konstantnom balansiranju između ograničenih resursa sa jedne strane i opšte neprijateljskog okruženja sa druge. Svaki tip oružja ima svoju vrstu municije, svako oružje može doći u nekoliko različitih varijacija, filteri za gas masku se brzo troše, a baterija za lampu mora konstantno da se puni uz pomoć ručnog dinama. Resursi su veoma ograničeni, zbog čega morate stalno da imate na umu spisak onoga što imate i onoga što vam nedostaje.\n\nOno u čemu Metro 2033 briljira jeste atmosfera, koja igru baca u sam vrh postapokaliptičnog podžanra.. Sama priča nije toliko dobro predstavljena (mada, pretpostavljam da su neke stvari dublje obrađene u literarnom predlošku) budući da je karakterizacija likova morala biti dublja, određeni momenti jasnije osvetljeni a i sam način pripovedanja nije najsrećnije rešen. Međutim, trud koji je uložen u detalje vidi se na svakom koraku: sitne životne drame stanovnika stanica metroa, deka koji svira neku prastaru melodiju svom unuku, fotografije starog sveta koje stalno podsećaju preživele na ono što su izgubili... Takve sitnice čine Metro univerzum sumorno živim, i ujedno neodoljivim za vas da se u njega uživite. Glasovna gluma je fantastična, a težak ruski akcenat i (ne)namerne greške u engleskom prevodu povećavaju dozu šarma kojim ova igra obiluje. Ponekad težak, sirov i robustan, Metro 2033, radi tačno ono što treba: u najboljem (post)sovjetskom maniru, prikazuje jedan izmišljeni mračni svet koji sutra može da postane realnost.\n\n95/100","August 11, 2013","true","9.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

Anyway Metro 2033 is really addictive, graphics is amazing just like the story. It is sometimes so scary that it becomes better than many survival horror games(try not to fear on Ranger HC mode (^_-)).

The story is rich with detail and the graphics make it so immersive into the world of russian apocalyptica. This is a must have if your into your shooters or if you just love gaming at all. Playing it on the hardcore/ranger mode makes it even more emmersive and realistic and offers a great challenge that you will actually enjoy, It means your hand isn't held the whole way through playing and you have to work things out for your self which is what every game should be like to give you a sence of achievement and adventure. It's worth picking up full price or on sale it will last you hours of enjoyment and will probably end up in your favourite game list! :)","June 22, 2014","true","19.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Very unique and challenging, I suggest playing at a difficulty no less than Hard 'cause there you'll really run out of ammo and rethink your strategy. The game tries to be realistic in terms of managing your items, like ammo and oxygen, and the UI, like looking at your watch and at a paper, sort of like a to-do list (honestly don't know what it's called) for your objectives. There are flaws of course but I enjoyed it nonetheless.

Sometimes you are going stealthy, others you go full blast mode and sometimes you do not see a shootable enemy for a good amount of time, but none of these happen for too long. Once you get the hang of it, the game turns a challenging, mostly fair and rewarding experience.

Just perfect. The Story is well told , it's easy to build a connection to Artyom (your character) and all the NPC's in this game , i realy enjoyed beeing around Khan for example.\n\nOn higher difficulties it's realy hard to manage your Ammo - that's where the Survival part kicks in, maintaining your ammo is a must on Hardcore+ even on normal there are some passages in which you almost or comepletly run out of Ammo (Library im looking at you -.-).\n\nYou can either Rambo through the game and have alot of problems(on higher diff's) or make it sneaky and spare all the Ammo for situations in which you can't avoid a fight (again Library im looking at you.)\n\nAll in all i'd give this game a 9/10 because i think they could somewhat work on the Stealth system because once enemys detect you you wont go back to "undetected" at all. They always know you're there. But from what i heard they changed that in Metro Redux.\n\n\nGreat game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/h0lyheretic/recommended/43110/","h0lyheretic","HolyHeretic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/h0lyheretic/","209 products in account","tl;dr: definitely worth a playthrough for the awesome mechanics and atmosphere, but probably no more than that because of frustrating stealth sections, fluctuating difficulty curve, and uninvolved story. Good game, especially if you got it for free.\n\nWhat it does right: The atmosphere was amazing. I don't think I've ever played a post-apocalyptic game that made me love the world this much. The situation is dire and everything is rundown like you would expect after the near-extinction of humanity. All the little touches like the hand-made weapons and having to hold onto every bullet like it could mean your life set up a great setting that I really loved to run around in. Certain odd additions later on in the story didn't even take me out of the experience because they were implemented into the world so well. Even the mutants were a blast to try to fight through when every fight could mean a quick death.\n\nThe shooting mechanics weren't anything special, and neither was the weapon systems. The design of a lot of the guns were awesome, but I felt there was a missed opportunity to customize and create new weapons with the junk. Not enough of a thing to go in the bad, but it would've been cool.\n\nWhile it wasn't perfect, a lot of little touches really made me like this game. Your npc companions could actually defend themselves, and when they couldn't, you never actually had to worry about babysitting them with a horde of enemies to worry about as well. Even down to the bounce of the laser pointer off of the glass. This game obviously had a lot of thought put into it, and the quality really shows in the final product. Even things like having to change a filter on a gas mask or recharging a flashlight were huge when it came to setting a mood for the game.\n\nAlso the visuals were very crisp and eye-catching. Definitely couldn't complain about graphics at any point in the game.\n\nWhat it does wrong: Let's get the big one out of the way right at the start: stealth.\n\nFor all this game does right, I guess it had to get a few things wrong. I just wish what it did was so extremely frustrating. The stealth sections are so infuriating that most of the time I just shot my way through and it ended up being easier. I know I probably suck, but having an entire base know your exact location after one missed throwing knife attempt isn't a good game mechanic. A lot of the times I was even in cover and supposedly out of sight when all hell began to come down on me and kill me almost instantly. I may be wrong, but it seemed like these sections had the enemies do more damage than normal for near-instant deaths after being spotted. Either way, these sections almost made me want to drop the game altogether, and I dreaded when I saw a few throwing knives laid out for one that might be ahead.\n\nThe hit detection for the throwing knives was really odd as well. While at first I thought it might've just been armor or something making my knives bounce off, after three or four attempts to kill one guy and failing showed that this probably wasn't the case. This only happened two or three times in the entire game, but it was enough to ruin that attempt before it went anywhere.\n\nAs well as stealth sections being unnecessarily hard, there were a few others that felt like it was suddenly near-impossible to get through without lowering the difficulty.You'll know what sections I'm talking about when you get to them. But certain situations just seemed like it was just being downright unfair instead of hard.\n\nLastly, it's not a big one, but the story. A bit of a spoiler, but most of your companions either die or split off before you ever get a chance to get to know them. With the great world they built up, there was also a great chance to make some really awesome characters too. It gets better near the end, but the story becomes mostly a background thought to gameplay, and I felt like that detracted from the experience. Had they took the time to have some more character-centric moments and fleshed out some of your companions, the story would have been a lot more interesting, and every death would've hurt that much more when you start weighing it against your overall objective, but as it stands, I never really cared too much when people died around me when I never really got to know them in the first place.\n\nWhile talking about the story, there were a lot of things that weren't fleshed out very well. I got the part about getting backup from polis to fight the dark ones, but missles? And there was apparently some massive city of dark ones on the surface? None of this was explained and it seems like it just happens cause the plot demands we go to new locations to fight something.  A lot more could've been done with Artyom's power to resist the dark ones, and who they were as well.\n\nAll in all, it was a fun game to play through, and a very interesting world to be in. I'll definitely check out it's sequel, but I don't know if I'll be giving this one another play through. Nothing much to go back for, and the thought of having to trudge through those stealth sections makes me groan. Would definitely recommend playing through this game at least once for the experience of it.\n\n","November 14, 2014","true","9.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story is quite good, if not fully explained; but I think leaving some mystery to it is for the best in this case.  Graphically it has a cosistently claustrophobic and grimy feel, with a decent variety of enemies which are enough of a threat to keep you on edge.  There is some variety in the weapons and they are pretty cool, but this could have been better as once you started a particular segment you rarely run into many weapons you can switch to, so consider your choices carefully.  Having to worry about keeping your flashlight charged, and conserving ammo and gas mask filters adds to the tension.   Took me about 10 hours to get through the story and I could see the pull to replaying it in ranger mode (sans hud and directional queues), but I'd avoid doing that before playing through the game first, as it doesn't always explain itself well ... or maybe it does and I just couldn't tell, because although the english voice acting is quite good, I found that it was basically inaudible at any distance from the NPCs.  ItSo maybe they were giving me a lot of queues that I just missed.  I probably wouldn't see replaying more than once though as it is quite linear.  I'd give it a recommend and an 8/10","March 6, 2015","true","11.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Nonetheless, it is an amazing gaming experience. The game is surprisingly varied, no situation overstays its welcome. Sometimes you are going stealthy, others you go full blast mode and sometimes you do not see a shootable enemy for a good amount of time, but none of these happen for too long. Once you get the hang of it, the game turns a challenging, mostly fair and rewarding experience.

I started playing because I had the chance to try Last Light and thought it was great but I always try to play any series in order of release.\nPerhaps the best thing about 2033 is its atmosphere and sense of style. You get to discover a whole living and breathing wrld in the tunnels of the metro. There's been a nuclear holocaust and the survivers have taken refuge underground. They have build new cities there and are trying to lead normal life but they are plagued by mutated monsters and the constant war between the different factions(Reds, Nazis, etc). Your journey will take you accross the whole network of the metro letting you see people in their daily environment. You can stop and just listen to their conversations and it's actually worth it but you don't have to do it if you don't want to. You'll also see the different sides of the conflict so you can make your own judgements. There's also the surface which you'll get to explore a bit but I wish there was more of it. It can be even more unnerving than the darkness of the tunnels. You have to wear a gas mask and watch your oxygen levels. While you're forced to listen to your character heavy breathing you are being attacked by mutated beasts.\nGameplaywise 2033 combines FPS with stealth elements. Unfortunately the stealth isn't that great. Sneaking by is not always an option and to kill silently you have only throwable knives and any silent weapons that you may have. These are not alway reliable since enemies later in the game have heavy armour and a headshot won't do and my knives just bounced off them sometimes. If your cover gets blown evry guard in the area knows your position and you'll likely get butchered. This led to some of the most frustrating moments of the game. When fighting enemy AI is ok but I caught them doing some weird stuff like taking cover on the wrong side of a wall and just begging to be shot. The sections where you fight mutants are exciting and challenging. This is not the kind of game which let's you play Rambo style. Ammo and supplies are scarce and you need to watch them closely.\nOverall I like the weapons in the game - they realy look like they come from a post - apocalyptic world.I'm not a fan of the pneumatic ones which are powerful but require you to pump the manually as well as reloading them. They are unrliable when you are in a big fight surrounded by enemies. The game actually uses pre-war bullets as currency and you can either buy equipment with them or put them in your gun for a bigger punch.\nIn Metro 2033 you play as Artyom - a young man who has spent his live in his home station(town) and has no knowledge of the other parts of the metro. Now his people are being killed of by the Dark Ones. These are a new kind of mutants which seem to have some psychic powers. Artyom is somehow special and is able to establish contact with them. After even a highy trained soldier is disapers fighting the Dark Ones Aryom sets off for the city of the rangers(a neutral faction) to report the situation and ask for help. The game has strong sense of adventure. You'll meet several interesting characters along the way (Khan being my favourite) and you'll explore various  environments. There are two possible endings to the game but this may remain hidden for most players. I wouldn't have known myself if I haden't looked it up. If you intend to play the game only once look it up. Otherwise it's better not to splil it for yourself. Also the silent protagonist doesn't help storytelling much. Voice acting a bit of a hit and miss and some of the character models of the supporting charecters are difficult to distinguish from one another. Overall story is interesting, not the greatest but pretty good.\nI should mention some of the main drawbacks for me. Like I said above stealth needs iprovement and AI could be a bit better. Also the controlls feel kind of weird (I play with a 360 controller). For instance melee and iron sights use one and the same button meaning you can't melee with some weapons and can't look through the sights with others. Also you have to cycle through weapons rather than having a seperate button for bringing up a selection menu. It's just not up to date with modern shooters (in terms of controls).\nTo sum it up I enjoyed the game and I recommend it to anyone who values atmosphere, story and a solid sinle player FPS experience. You ralely get so attention on the campaign especially in this genre. I've just started Last Light and it looks like it's not necessary to play the original to get in to it I suggest that you do.\nThis is actually my first review on Steam. I hope it helps someone :)","August 20, 2014","true","4.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/h3dr0x/recommended/43110/","h3dr0x","Hedrox™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/h3dr0x/","268 products in account","Revisiting: Metro 2033\n\nOriginal recommendation: A strange mix of Survival Horror and First Person Shooter, Metro 2033 is a well-scripted shooter in a highly atmospheric post apocalyptic world. The story is a little short, but full of shocking moments and fast-paced shooting. You're constantly encountering new factions, discovering interesting new locations, or being tasked to do something you haven't done before. Providing your system is capable, you'll be treated to a gorgeous experience which will make the game all the more immersive and fun to play.\n\nThe story: In 2033, Artyom, a 20-year-old survivor and one of the first-born in the metro, learns from an elite soldier, named Hunter that a group of mysterious creatures referred to as the Dark Ones are threatening his station in the Metro.\nHaving not read the source material, I can't say how faithfully it's adapted, however I can say its a great story with a surprising ending(s).\n\nPresentation: Graphics are as good as they come: beautiful environments with a surprising amount of detail and fantastic animations. As for audio, the english voice acting is pretty poor, the guns don’t sound particularly powerful, but the monster noises will leave you quivering in fear.\n\nGameplay: For a first person shooter, there is actually surprisingly little shooting. There are some heavy action scenes and fights for survival against hordes of mutants, yet they are just one part of the game. The stealth aspect part is done fairly well - you can shoot or turn off most light sources and sneaking past everyone is sometimes a valid strategy. To top things off, there are also a couple of vehicle sections and the ability to upgrade your equipment by scavenging or buying better weapons.\nIn order to experience everything this game has to offer I recommend playing on ranger difficulty, with no crosshair and russian audio with your preferred subtitle option.\n\nGraphics: 10\nSound: 7 (9 with russian audio)\nGameplay: 8\nStory: 9\nMultiplayer: N/A\n\nOverall: 8.5/10","May 27, 2013","true","20.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Game however isn't 100% consistent with book, but it's highly based on, only some not important(for story) fragments aren't shown, and of course some parts of missions are added by developer to make the gameplay more interesting. Anyway Metro 2033 is really addictive, graphics is amazing just like the story. It is sometimes so scary that it becomes better than many survival horror games(try not to fear on Ranger HC mode (^_-)). Sound effects are good as well, and they fill After-War Moscows Subway with great climate and unique atmosphere.","April 12, 2014","true","19.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

All of that held up with really interesting characters and enemies with a challenging combat and great level variety. This game will take you between 10-12 hours and there is not even one boring or a dole moment. Oh, and I forgot the awesome graphics. The only bad thing in my opinion about the game is the ammo problem which does add to the atmosphere, but do make it annoying sometimes.

Dmitry Glukhovsky (The author of the book) has created a perfect atmosphere and environment, with points in which one truly values the existence of other people. With civilizations being far apart, one also feels that sense of insecurity whenever they are not within a civilization.\n\nDespite the game being hugely linear, it makes up for it with immersion, atmosphere, story, detail and most, if not all aspects of the game. And, in saying it is a linear game, one is free to choose the how they'd like to take on the majority of battles, with a pleasing and sufficient array of weaponry to purchase and find.\n\nIt really is a flawless game for what it is, if it wasn't linear, it would come close to being my number 1 game.

You're in post-apocalyptic Russia, too afraid of radiation to go above ground. So what do you do naturally? You stay in the intricate network of train stations and tunnels; the Russian Metro.\n\nThe graphics in this game are simply stunning. One of the most graphically advance games on the market, you will need some significant hardware to get a solid 60 frames per second. An AMD Radeon HD 7970 GHz edition or Nvidia GTX 680 should do the trick, if paired with a proper processor such as the i5 2500 or similiar Intel Quad-core. 4 gigabytes of ram is reccommended as well.\n\nThe gameplay is different from the likes of any other game I've played. The HUD is quite minimal, only showing what is necessary. That means no minimap, no crosshair (disabled by default, though it can be enabled.), and no health bar. The recoil of the weapons is quite realistic, though some of the guns are fictional so there is no real-life comparison.\n\nI like this game, a lot. I would reccommend this if you are into games like Fallout, or even Dead Space. The genre is technically "Survival Horror" -- though I've only actually jumped in situations where it's quiet and something pops out; nothing is horrible or terrifying, per se.\n\nIf you can catch this game on sale, pick it up and try it. If you're genuinely interested it playing it, I'd highly reccommend watching some gameplay first.

After the nuclear war that have destroyed the surface of the planet, and made it almost impossible to live on top. Interesting story with never before explored underground metro environments and atmospheric ambiance.\n\nLevels are mostly linear with some additional room to explore. Survivor towns are creatively designed and have a "lived in" feel. Some areas require you to use gas masks in order to survive. Ammunition is literally in weight of gold, and every round means life or death.\n\nEnemy variation is small, from simple humans to monsters and mutants. Depending on your play style, there's not much variation of gear. Two armor sets in game will make you tougher or allow you to sneak unnoticed, pretty much guns blazing or silent assassin.\n\nOverall game experience is good if you enjoy end of the world theme, mutants, dark tunnels with no visibility, and occasional scares.","August 15, 2015","true","14.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The atmosphere is great and the game is very immersive; there have been numerous occasions when I was genuinely pretty terrified. Weapon selection is a little limited but each gun is very indididual and fun to use; to be honest any more weapons would draw the focus away from the rest of the gameplay and make the game too loot orientated. Playing on normal difficulty provides sufficient challenge - enemy solider AI is not fantastic; combat is fun though and you certainly die very quickly so you don't feel like a bullet sponge and you really have to be on edge to survive.

It is insanely addicting to me. The struggle for ammo is real, and adds tension to the air by the second. Best last resort is your knife, I had to do this in the intro with Hunter because they only gave you like 10 or so bullets for your Revolver on Ranger Easy. (This was the second playthrough, mind you.) However, I've never broken a mask, so I can't tell you what that's like. I'm sure its terrifying.\n\nIf your a fan of post-apocalyptic games, this one is definitely for you. The main currency of the game are old Military-Grade rounds, for God's sake. The patchwork of the weapons early on sell it even more. I swear, the Double-Barrel is made of tin cans.\n\nI'm looking forward to playing Metro: Last Light for this Christmas. Oh, and if you are planning to get this game, I highly recommend getting the Redux Edition.

Hard to get into at first, but can catch on come about a third through. Have to play it a second time to really understand, I think, though. Two endings given how you act during the game, and set as a flashback. Campaign is literally "story mode" in that sense. Reinforces that you're not some immortal gun-toting war-god, but a human. A young one, at that, struggling for survival in a post-apocalyptic world.\n\nDoes a good job of mixing live-action with cinematics, sometimes hard to tell if you're about to die or messed up or doing everything right and advancing in the level. Definitely full of twists and turns (and a bit of humor) in that regard. Almost movie quality.\n\nCan beat it in a day-- regrettably semi-short, but full of secrets and things to do to prolong the game experience.\n\nGreat for players of all styles. Supports in-depth stealth, or straight-up shoot-them-all; explorers, or run-throughs. You WILL get lost sometimes, though, and you WILL have to stop and think.","January 1, 2013","true","16.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Then I read the book! As I read I could hear the creepy, wet creaking of the tunnels I had crawled and run through while playing the game. The ideas presented in the book added depth to my understanding of the bleak world I had fought my way through and made me keen to experience the alternate endings.\nThese games present one of the most credible apocalyptic futures I have experienced. I felt immersed in the world that kept trying to kill me. Metro: Last Light was especially satisfying when I was able to address Artyom's anguish as he realised what he was destroying in the final moments of the novel.\nThe Metro games ask us to think about the way we approach the concept of "us" and "them". Is it a default setting that causes humans to fear the "other"?","July 25, 2015","true","31.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story is interesting, graphics amazingly realistic, and environments extremely immersive. Why did I stop? I got freaked out when things got intense. The developers did an amazing job. Instead of a cumbersome immersion-breaking UI (there is a small HUD during gameplay) mission progress is tracked by the character looking at a clipboard, time checked by looking at a wristwatch, and so on.

The atmosphere is great and the game is very immersive; there have been numerous occasions when I was genuinely pretty terrified. Weapon selection is a little limited but each gun is very indididual and fun to use; to be honest any more weapons would draw the focus away from the rest of the gameplay and make the game too loot orientated. Playing on normal difficulty provides sufficient challenge - enemy solider AI is not fantastic; combat is fun though and you certainly die very quickly so you don't feel like a bullet sponge and you really have to be on edge to survive.

That proved to be a bad idea since i ended up staying awake all night playing the game. The atmosphere and sound design make such a strong and powerful impression with lots of clever writing that pulled me right in the moment i picked it up.\n\nMetro 2033 is incredibly distinctive with the sound design. There's russian accents everywhere and lots and lots of little sounds that keep you on your toes as you play the game. A particularly memorable example of the sound design is the interactions between the various people you meet, especially the rangers later on, they all have really distinctive voices that sucks you in to the story so strongly that i swear i can still hear some of them.\n\nGraphically this game shines as well. the various metro stations that you go to all feel like someones home and there's a fair amount of little side quests to do in said metros.\n\nBeing based of a book, this game has very solid and gripping writing with characters that are believeble and feel like they have genuine feelings for each other, such as the rangers that have little spats during the mission or Khan, the mystical man who genuinely makes you think about what you're doing.\n\nGameplay is also a strong FPS affair with a few interesting bits and pieces dropped in to keep it lively and interesting. An example is having two 'classes' of ammunition, one of which being Millitary Grade and the other the cheap Metro ones, Millitary rounds being used as a form of currency.\n\nI had one fairly big issue to be honest, the FOV for what i'm used to is tiny and i believe it's only 75 Degrees. it isn't a detriment to the game but i found that increasing it makes the game a lot better to play.\n\nIn summary, Would i reccomend? Hell Yes! if you have put off playing this game, pick it up and play it!","May 23, 2014","true","13.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jlaw/recommended/43110/","jlaw","Johnny Law","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jlaw/","478 products in account","Metro 2033 is a linear shooter at heart.  It then gives you a smattering of stealth, RPG, and other mechanics to fiddle with -- none of which it particularly excels at, but it does have an intriguing lean toward diagetic (visible-in-the-game-world) systems, for that "you are there" touch.\n\nFor a game nominally about subway tunnels, it looks great, if your computer is man enough for it.  The ruined urban areas above and below ground are beautiful and spooky instances of these kinds of spaces.\n\nFinally -- its eastern-European roots are showing in the overall mood of the game, and in a certain lack of nannying.  If you can roll with it, the freedom to fail helps maintain a workable illusion of agency.\n\nTogether these aspects are all about "pulling you in".  You won't keep playing Metro 2033 because of a gameplay skill challenge or a suspenseful story or collectibles or unlockables or levelling up. Its hook is simply a fascination for being in its world.","February 5, 2011","true","11.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is an EXTREMELY good game, with EXTREMELY good graphics. It is well optimised (I don't have such a good computer and it works at nearly 60-70 fps). It does get you into the atmosphere, spooks the sh!t out of you, makes you sit on the edge of your chaire because of the suspense, and it can LITERALLY make you rip your hair off (I'm talking to you, f*cking librarians).It is once again a GREAT game from 4A Games. It does indeed deserve the title of "4A". At some moments, it is also very emotional. For example, when you realise what happens and that everybody died, and who survived is nearly dead, you start crying. Hard. Also, "Press E".\n\nPros : Extremely Good Graphics\nExtremely good post-apocalyptic atmosphere\nNice combat\nEXTREMELY Detailed items/NPCs.\nA huge variety of weapons\nAnd Russia.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OriginSaint/recommended/43110/","OriginSaint","Origin Saint","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OriginSaint/","523 products in account","NOTE:  There is a remastered version of this game on the Steam store called Metro 2033 Redux, this review is for the original, not that one.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\nMetro 2033 is a very well made game with a very memorable story to boot and graphics that really rocked for the time the game was released, and still look pretty damn good today.\n\nYou play as the Russian Artyom, in the year 2033, well after a nuclear winter has destroyed the surface world of Earth and the people of Russia have been forced underground to live in the metro tunnels due to how inhabitable the surface became.\n\nThis is all to mention nothing of the creatures that now lurk the Earth.  Moscow is now home to what it's people call Nosalises, Demons ("♥♥♥♥♥es" if your name is Bourbon), Librarians and more.  These are mutated, radiated and otherwise newly created/modified/evolved creatures that apparently aren't fond of humans.  The Nosalises are similar to large mutated mole-dogs with variants of many types ranging from flying to a rhino variant.  The Demons are large flying creatures, resembling a cross with a bat/gargoyle and possible tiger.  The Librarians are the real threat here; Large, muscular, haired, gorilla-looking beast that likes to snort around and bare their teeth.  The developers did an amazing job with bringing these creatures to life in this game, and really letting the player know that they aren't to be trifled with.  The general lack of ammo and medkits, coupled with the available frequency of encountering some of these creatures really makes you start to respect the game atmosphere and possibly cause to you be more cautious when navigating the game world to avoid certain death when you're low on ammo.\n\nThis game runs on ammunition.  Ammunition is the currency of the game world, as well as your primary source of self-defense (provided you have something to shoot the bullet out of).  The developers really did a great job of making the ammunition just hard enough to find on any difficulty that most players will be required to start thinking of how much they have, how much they're using and what weapons would be best to use.  They also implemented some really cool weapons in the game, such as the ghetto-rigged ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ gun, which is really only good at overheating itself and using up ammo, but you'll likely encounter a time when it's all you got.\n\nThe characters in the game develop well and you can actually get to know some of them and develop a relationship/attachment to them.  They all have unique personalities, even down to their names.  The game spends a lot of time trying to get you acquainted with the different characters, and does a great job of it.\n\n\nThe graphics and sound are very well done.  The graphics, despite being an older game, can still give newer hardware a bit of trouble due to the un-optimization of the game I believe.  The world design is great, especially the moment you first step foot outside of the metro and see Moscow in the aftermath of the nuclear fallout with a Demon flying above crumbling gray buildings, Nosalises running across things and your gas mask glaring and frosting up.\n\nThis game is one of my favorites and very underrated for what it is.  I certainly recommend this game.","October 20, 2015","true","17.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its a geat horror story, you`ll be fighting the mutated monsters and with that will be fighting the humans, of course. You will need to scavenge for ammo, which rewards you for exploring! The environment is detailed, and in the story you`ll be given decisions which you will have to make.\nBy the way it has 2 endings!\nThe only downside for me is that there is no multiplayer, the enemy AI could also be alittle problematic, honestly I did get lost but only once. Its a great game, but I recommend the Metro: Last Light over this one, once you`ve played that and you want more, come to the less refined editon.\nVERDICT:\n7.5-8/10","April 12, 2015","true","10.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Metro 2033 may not do anything perticularly innovative it is a great example of how linear FPS's can provide a detailed and entertaining narrative experience.\n\nPros:\n-Fantastic detail. Search around enough and you'll always find somewhere these people eat, sleep, trade and even poop.\n-Strong narrative. A nice stroy with a few choices sprinkled along the way.\n-Strong gunplay. You point and click, stuff dies - nice!\n-Good stealth mechanics, stealth is almost always an option.\n-Ranger modes. I highly recommend both ranger moders perticuarly ranger hardcore mode. They make combat leathal but    fair and it creates this organic shooter/stealth gameplay which most games cannot provide.\n-Good graphics and audio.\n-A great atmosphere. Both the towns, shootouts and horror elements all feel 'right'. They really nailed the atmosphere of the era and the book.\n\nCons:\n-Linear. For those who hate corridors, stay away.\n-Nothing that innovative. What there shines but it's nothing too new.\n-Ranger Hardcore mode makes one part of the game close to impossible. You can change the difficultly on the fly and you'll probably have to for that one section (close to the end).\n\nOverall great game - RECOMMENDED.","June 28, 2014","true","8.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The fact it has an interesting and intriging storyline is icing on the cake. The outcome of the game depends on the player's relationship with the environment and the people he or she encounters along the way. Kill or don't kill. Play a combinaton of stealth and gunner, or straight up one way or the other. Either way is challenging and did I mention fun!

To be honest, I never knew what it is about - just heard a few things. Many years later now I thought that it's finally time to play it. That was a good choice but still, I wish I would decided to do it much earlier.\n\nIt was around beggining of autumn 2015. I'm glad I picked Metro 2033 to play during this season because for some reason it's the best time to play post-apocaliptic games, at least for me. While I wasn't so much curious about this game or the next one, once I started to play I get right into it. I felt how amazing Metro was. My first thought was it's kind of like Stalker games but sadly without open world. But I think it turned out to be good thing. I could say few things about graphics (it looks fantastic even many years after release), music, story or how great atmosphere this game have. To be honest, I would like only to say only something about Ranger mode. This is main reason why I enjoyed this game so much. Harder, but only because it's more realistic, and without any HUD you can enjoy Metro 2033 even more. It makes you think more serious about surviving in this cruel world, looking for other solutions that the obvious one. I wouldn't mind at all if it was replaced as normal game mode. This way more people who doesn't like to play a game few times could enjoy it too.\n\nToo bad there is no option to buy this game anymore, since there is only Redux edition. Not sure if it's better but I heard only bad things about it, while compared to normal version of Metro 2033. Still, if you want to enjoy game with post-apocalyptic world, Metro 2033 (both this or Redux version) is great choice.","November 15, 2015","true","124.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","1"

Depending on the level you play strategy and tactics are vital to survive. I rarely had the impression in other games that the game was literally trying to kill me (my character).

You could question the graphics, they are decent, even on lower qualities, but bear in mind that this wasn't a big studio budget game (even Last Light was 10% the budget of some of its competitors and look how well that did). The weapon animations and idle ones are, however, unique and (again) immersive.\n\nThe story isn't 100% faithful to the book I must add, but that's hardly a negative, it gives the same impression.

If you've ever wondered what living in a post-apocalyptic world was like, this game captures it amazingly. Gameplay is intense and rewarding, if not uncompromising. You'll get the feeling you're fighting for your survival at every moment. Everything about this game is both grim and beautiful. You can feel the ragged hope in the metro stations, the relentless misery of the torn, blasted city above ground, and everything in between. From bandits to monsters, mutants to soldiers, and even ghosts and phenomena to the despair of life in the Metro, it will make you realize one thing: we can't relinquish the things that make us human.","June 9, 2011","true","94.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story is a little short, but full of shocking moments and fast-paced shooting. You're constantly encountering new factions, discovering interesting new locations, or being tasked to do something you haven't done before. Providing your system is capable, you'll be treated to a gorgeous experience which will make the game all the more immersive and fun to play.\n\nThe story: In 2033, Artyom, a 20-year-old survivor and one of the first-born in the metro, learns from an elite soldier, named Hunter that a group of mysterious creatures referred to as the Dark Ones are threatening his station in the Metro.\nHaving not read the source material, I can't say how faithfully it's adapted, however I can say its a great story with a surprising ending(s).\n\nPresentation: Graphics are as good as they come: beautiful environments with a surprising amount of detail and fantastic animations. As for audio, the english voice acting is pretty poor, the guns don’t sound particularly powerful, but the monster noises will leave you quivering in fear.\n\nGameplay: For a first person shooter, there is actually surprisingly little shooting. There are some heavy action scenes and fights for survival against hordes of mutants, yet they are just one part of the game. The stealth aspect part is done fairly well - you can shoot or turn off most light sources and sneaking past everyone is sometimes a valid strategy. To top things off, there are also a couple of vehicle sections and the ability to upgrade your equipment by scavenging or buying better weapons.\nIn order to experience everything this game has to offer I recommend playing on ranger difficulty, with no crosshair and russian audio with your preferred subtitle option.\n\nGraphics: 10\nSound: 7 (9 with russian audio)\nGameplay: 8\nStory: 9\nMultiplayer: N/A\n\nOverall: 8.5/10","May 27, 2013","true","20.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game left me feeling unsure of what to think of it. It had put me in such a sad mood while playing, meaning it had a good story if it was able to make me feel something in the least, yet there were times where I wanted to just throw my laptop out the window from pure frustration from the game's bugs and unfixed issues. It's certainly playable, and for that matter, beatable, but there come times in the game where it feels as if neither of those things are true. I recieved my copy for free, so perhaps I shouldn't be harsh at all with it. But to others, it may come as a giant waste of time. I think if you buy it, you need to stay dedicated to it, and appreciate it for what it gives you. I also heard that Metro Last Light (the sequel) is better and I assume the Metro Redux that was made fixes those glitches, so you should probably just purchase the redux instead of the older version. If you're all about playing "classic versions", than go ahead, just be precautious of what problems await you.","November 8, 2014","true","11.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I didn't like how dark it was all the time (I know that's silly because it's set in a metro but I still hated it), I thought it was needlessly complicated and so on. I don't think I made it past level 1 before uninstalling. About a year later I gave it another try and forced myself to play for at least a couple of hours and I realized that I absolutely loved it. It is one of the scariest games I have ever played and on ranger hardcore mode it is very very challenging - you have to think about each step you take carefully because you die QUICKLY and ammunition and other supplies are scarce. It is very immersive and the immense graphics add to this massively. The lighting and shadows too are amazing. When you have to go outside you need to make sure you carry filters for your gas mask and if you run out you're dead, unless you can run inside very quickly, which you won't be able to unless you're right at the end of the level. There isn't too much exploration to be found, but there is some and it is rewarded with precious ammunition and other supplies.\n\nFor balance I will mention a few things I don't like. Stealth is broken. Sometimes it works, other times if one single enemy is alerted to your presence then every single enemy on the level will know where you are forever. Also they sometimes see you even if you're hiding in total darkness, even if they don't have a flashlight or night vision equipment. Another thing that annoyed me was how good and bad ammunition looks so alike you often can't tell what you're firing. In this game "clean" ammunition is currency, you buy stuff with it and sell stuff for it. It's like money. "Dirty" ammunition is ammunition that is made by metro inhabitants. It does less damage but you get more of it, so you want to use as much dirty ammunition as possible and keep your clean ammunition to buy supplies (except in emergencies where you have to load clean ammunition in to your gun because you're out of dirty ammo). The problem is that the levels are so dark you often accidentally fire all of your clean ammo without realizing it because they look pretty much the same. This isn't a problem if you play on easy mode because the HUD tells you what you're firing, but on hard or ranger modes you have no HUD at all.\n\nOverall though this is a fantastic game and MUCH better than the sequel.","May 3, 2015","true","16.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Metro is very much the slick, story-channeled sibling of the more free-roaming S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games. Both are brilliant, and I am unashamedly and irretrievably biased towards both. Metro 2033 shows just how open-world a channelled game can feel when it is honed with artistry and innovation at every turn. Story is always central to the Metro games. However, I never once felt I was being moved on too speedily, or claustrophobically led through the story.\n\nThe inventory system - or lack thereof - was an irritation at first. This did not last, however.  (Here I should mention that, as with Last Light, I only played the game on Ranger mode, which apparently has a more limited UI than the standard mode of the game). The weapons in 2033 have a wealth of character and personality, making an inventory UI all but unnecessary. The way ammo is handled, however, could be improved upon. Pre-war ammo can be used as currency as well as ammunition, and is only distinguished by a slightly brighter icon. Several times I found myself firing this currency inadvertently.\n\nThe characters are rich and real; at times they took and left the stage too speedily, but never so fast as to fail to make an impact. I ended the game with a clear memory of the characters as a distinct and tangible cast. The larger narrative too is one that manages to surprise and move the player.\n\nWith the graphics set to high, this game will challenge the most advanced gaming PCs. I found 2033 stressed my rig more than Last Light, in fact. The work is warranted - textures are deep and detailed. Even in dimly lit passages, lighting is applied with skill and balance.","June 17, 2014","true","14.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I played other games set in the post-apocalypse, and the world the developers created is a very good and intense one. Hard to think of something I don't like, really. If you are into post-apocalypse, get the game, get headphones and play.","May 1, 2015","true","13.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game switches gears frequently, and this can lead to some supply problems if you aren't reading ahead or just lucky. Otherwise, the game has a lot of atmosphere, some workmanlike action, and a plot that would be excellent if it was not so silly. You might already own it as part of a bundle, and if not, consider buying it if you like the post-apocalypse or Russia.","January 13, 2013","true","11.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I didn't like how dark it was all the time (I know that's silly because it's set in a metro but I still hated it), I thought it was needlessly complicated and so on. I don't think I made it past level 1 before uninstalling. About a year later I gave it another try and forced myself to play for at least a couple of hours and I realized that I absolutely loved it. It is one of the scariest games I have ever played and on ranger hardcore mode it is very very challenging - you have to think about each step you take carefully because you die QUICKLY and ammunition and other supplies are scarce. It is very immersive and the immense graphics add to this massively. The lighting and shadows too are amazing. When you have to go outside you need to make sure you carry filters for your gas mask and if you run out you're dead, unless you can run inside very quickly, which you won't be able to unless you're right at the end of the level. There isn't too much exploration to be found, but there is some and it is rewarded with precious ammunition and other supplies.\n\nFor balance I will mention a few things I don't like. Stealth is broken. Sometimes it works, other times if one single enemy is alerted to your presence then every single enemy on the level will know where you are forever. Also they sometimes see you even if you're hiding in total darkness, even if they don't have a flashlight or night vision equipment. Another thing that annoyed me was how good and bad ammunition looks so alike you often can't tell what you're firing. In this game "clean" ammunition is currency, you buy stuff with it and sell stuff for it. It's like money. "Dirty" ammunition is ammunition that is made by metro inhabitants. It does less damage but you get more of it, so you want to use as much dirty ammunition as possible and keep your clean ammunition to buy supplies (except in emergencies where you have to load clean ammunition in to your gun because you're out of dirty ammo). The problem is that the levels are so dark you often accidentally fire all of your clean ammo without realizing it because they look pretty much the same. This isn't a problem if you play on easy mode because the HUD tells you what you're firing, but on hard or ranger modes you have no HUD at all.\n\nOverall though this is a fantastic game and MUCH better than the sequel.","May 3, 2015","true","16.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You also had to be careful with ammo, or else you'll find yourself in a tight situation. The game does a great job in making you have to work hard and think smart in surviving. I didn't really pay attention to graphics because it should be the story that counts, and the story was amazing. This game is perfect for anyone who enjoys a FPS with horror and adventure aspects.

It is an EXTREMELY good game, with EXTREMELY good graphics. It is well optimised (I don't have such a good computer and it works at nearly 60-70 fps). It does get you into the atmosphere, spooks the sh!t out of you, makes you sit on the edge of your chaire because of the suspense, and it can LITERALLY make you rip your hair off (I'm talking to you, f*cking librarians).It is once again a GREAT game from 4A Games. It does indeed deserve the title of "4A". At some moments, it is also very emotional. For example, when you realise what happens and that everybody died, and who survived is nearly dead, you start crying. Hard. Also, "Press E".\n\nPros : Extremely Good Graphics\nExtremely good post-apocalyptic atmosphere\nNice combat\nEXTREMELY Detailed items/NPCs.\nA huge variety of weapons\nAnd Russia.

After the nuclear war that have destroyed the surface of the planet, and made it almost impossible to live on top. Interesting story with never before explored underground metro environments and atmospheric ambiance.\n\nLevels are mostly linear with some additional room to explore. Survivor towns are creatively designed and have a "lived in" feel. Some areas require you to use gas masks in order to survive. Ammunition is literally in weight of gold, and every round means life or death.\n\nEnemy variation is small, from simple humans to monsters and mutants. Depending on your play style, there's not much variation of gear. Two armor sets in game will make you tougher or allow you to sneak unnoticed, pretty much guns blazing or silent assassin.\n\nOverall game experience is good if you enjoy end of the world theme, mutants, dark tunnels with no visibility, and occasional scares.","August 15, 2015","true","14.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Gung-ho bravado and sneaking around are both nessessary and the use of iron sights for most bun fights is recommended. The weapons are unusually comfortable - I particularly liked the throwing knives for a quick and silent dispatch and grenades, carefully placed, were a great ice-breaker when things got too serious. The landscaping and atmosphere were beautiful to behold and the soviet technology was a laugh; pausing in the middle of a desperate  gun battle to pump a dynamo to charge your night-vision goggles was a hoot. Shades of the S.T.A.L.K.E.R series and Fallout 3 with a tip of the hat to Doom 3, I heartily recommend a stay in the tunnels of Metro 2033 for anybody that likes a good adventure. The end gets a bit freaky but the setting and the situation sort of call for that anyway.
