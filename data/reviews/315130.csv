The controls are simple, and the sound effects and music aren't overpowering or annoying. Graphics are kind of nice as well. From what I've played it doesn't feel like an early access game, which is nice.\n\nSingle player is pretty fun because you use both robots, one at a time. This game has a Portal 2 type feeling to it, without the voices and the portal gun. Player Two and myself made a couple videos of our first time playing this game and uploaded them to YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/user/HiddenLevelStart), I will keep this review updated as I go with more thoughts.\n\nUpdate 1:\nJust unlocked my blue partner and the powers they share together. It's really neat. R3D has the power to absorb energy, and BLU3 has the power to use that energy and create an explosion. As the levels continue you switch back and forth from R3D to BLU3 to solve puzzles to make it to the end of the levels.\n\nIt now feels almost like a multiplayer game while playing as single player. A very unique feeling.\n\nUpdate 2:\nPlayer Two and myself tried the local multiplayer for the first time, it was quite fun playing split screen where we each controlled one of the robots. She used the controller and played R3D, and I used the keyboard and controlled BLU3.","April 6, 2015","true","1.5"," 37 of 47 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","37","47","0","0"

While this is in no way a hard game, without new or original concepts and co-op a little to be desired for, this is quite an interesting game worthy of your interest.\n\nThe Pros:Enjoyable Singleplayer - Due to the nature of the game's progression throughout the levels, singleplayer is both achievable and fun, even if the levels were meant for co-op. The lack of time-based puzzles allow you to easily switch between the two and complete the level by yourself.\n\nLong Levels - So far, the game features three chapters with seven levels each, but don't think you're getting only twenty one levels. Each level is actually a long tunnel of rooms, each with it's own puzzle. Most of them are ridiculously simple, but each stage takes about four to five minutes to complete.\n\nRobot Powers - This is one of those games where you need to collaborate because each robot has it's strengths and weaknesses. Red moves fast, jumps further, can move boxes and charges Blue with energy, while Blue is slower, but can explode, destroying turrets, weak walls, or clearing piles of obstacles.\n\nNice Level Design - The game play is 2D, meaning you are restricted to only one Z coordinate, however, the levels are 3D, with nice decor, decent lightning, and great ambient music.\n\nChallenges - Added replayability for the achievement hunter, you can challenge yourself with finding hidden orbs that require a bit more attention to reach or try to speedrun through the levels, or try not to die. Good luck!\nThe Cons:Too Easy - Because of its 2D movement system, the game really limits itself on how many things you can do. The only tricky parts are conveyor belts and deadly electric barriers. Most of the time, it's not a puzzle game as much as it is a jumping simulator. Also the levels are too linear. When you get to the most you can reach with one robot, you just switch to the other one, press a button, and all will make sense. You don't need to figure out when you have to switch robots, its always obvious.\n\nLocal Multiplayer Controls - The game is designed to work with a gamepad, but the controls are just as good and comfortable to use on a keyboard. But you can literally play this game only with one hand, using a maximum of 10 buttons at best. However, you cannot assign Player2 controls to other buttons on the keyboard. Instead, you are supposed to plug in a second controller, which is disappointing because 3/4 of the keyboard is left unused.\nConclusionA fun little game that could be an excellent game to play with your kids or your bored friends. Optionally Challenging without being boring, I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a casual puzzler.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more of my recommended games, you can view my reviews here, and be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","August 22, 2015","true","1.3"," 30 of 42 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","30","42","0","5"

Graphics are great, the gameplay fun and the puzzles interesting and somewhat reminiscent of Portal 2, just, you know, without portals. If you're an avid fan of the genre you will not have too much problems with most of the puzzles but still some are fairly challenging. If you have opportunity to play the game in co-op use it, it's implemented well and a lot more fun than singleplayer.\n\nI have not yet completed the game (I'd estimate I'm at roughly two thirds) and I reckon it would take about 6-8 hours to complete the game at this stage. Don't forget that it's still in early access so it will most probably get quite a bit more content later.\n\nMost of the achievements are somewhat easy to achieve, either through normal playing or a small effort but some are pretty hard (speedruns, completing the game without dying and the like).\n\nThe thing I like most about this game are the devs. Usually criticism or bug reports will be ignored, bugs stay in the game forever and sometimes games are completely unplayable. Threads in the game hub will not be answered for weeks and if they're answered it's usually not very helpful (looking at you Magicka 2). That's not the case here, the state of the game is great for an early access title, better than many other AAA games were and are, and the devs usually respond in about half a day, lots of the bugs getting fixed within a day or two.\n\nBottom line: if you like platformers give this one a try and support the amazing developers.","June 12, 2015","true","14.0"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

When I saw it on sale, I was very exctied, so I bought a copy for me and friend to play together.  I couldn't have been more excited to finally get a chance to sit down and play it.\n\nThen, I finally tried it, and boy was I disappointed.\n-I had to restart levels the first five times in a row because one of us either glitched through the floor, got stuck in a wall or ended up between some boxes or a shelf and couldn't jump out.\n-The options menu is not well designed.  It started me in 1024x768 and I couldn't turn the sound down because the bar was underneath the words.   Then when I changed resolution, I could only click on the bar, so there was no fine adjustment.  It was either 1 or 10, couldn't set anything in between.\n-At times it would randomly increase the volume to maximum for no reason.\n-The servers were very laggy, especially when looking at your partners screen.\n-There were switches that my partner would activate, it would show it worked on his screen, but the platforms never came down for me and we had to reset.\n\nGlitches and stuff aside, the game just isn't as fun as I was anticipating.  It has some cool mechanics, but in the end we just found ourselves bored quickly.  There doesn't seem to be any real story and the game just isn't that challenging to warrant wanting to continue playing.\n\nI will give the game another try when it comes out of EA because I really want to like it, but my hopes are very low.","August 8, 2015","false","1.8"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","15","21","0","0"

Simple but bland gameplay with regular visits from the glitch gremlins. I must note that i was under the impression while playing that this was a free-to-play game, but apparently it sells for $9.99. I must've received this game in a bundle some time ago and not even noticed. It is not the worst, nor the most broken game i've ever played, and i struggle to say anything negative about it other than the gameplay can be summed up simply as "meh". But it does certaintly seem more like a graded project for a visual design course than a $10 indie game. I can't imagine paying half of that and being satisfied in today's market.","October 19, 2015","false","0.4"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","8","9","2","0"

You're commanding two robots with complementing abilities through some kind of futuristic facility. One robot can collect energy from the environment, the other can use that energy to blow stuff up. One can carry and stack boxes to help its heavier companion reach higher platforms.\n\nThe puzzles are all fairly straight-forward, and the required platforming skills are pretty moderate. Both won't give a practiced player much of a challenge. Even the optional collectible orbs are usually so obvious that I didn't miss a single one on my first play-through. I wish there would have been some more difficult levels. There are plenty of game elements that could have been used to design some fiendish puzzles.","August 21, 2015","true","7.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

(The Schmaltzy Cynic)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/","468 products in account","I Don't Understand This Game\nI don't understand the thought process of this game.\n\n1.)  I don't understand how you can make a 2.5D game with zero 2D-gameplay mechanics other than moving in the X and Y axes for directions.  The hidden orbs are not that well-hidden and the one-or-two puzzles that utilize the 2D design feel forced and unneeded when, you know, you could move around in 3D as an alternative.\n\nThe game has/is a 3D environment that wants you to imagine it's only 2D. Funny enough, when you zoom-out for viewing the room, the game looks and plays like a 2D-ish game.\n\n(I'm not joking; there's a room at Level 14/15--I don't recall since they all blur into one--where each player is "trapped". Only, the forcefield blocks one part of the floor/screen when you could just walk around it, There's no facade.)\n\n2.)  I don't understand how you can have a game called CO-OP and gate access to cooperative play until Level 3.  It's not that long of a wait, 10 to 15 mins at most, but it still makes no sense. Look at Forced, Ibb & Obb, Castle Crashers, etc.\n\n3.)  I don't understand why design a cooperative game where one player has to wait for the other player.  I tried out cooperative with my significant other and we were doing the same thing I did for single-player: Waiting to advance based on the other player's involvement.\n\n4.)  I don't understand how this game is out of Early Access.  The game is far too short and takes way too long to get going on the cooperation (you two are only in the same room ONCE in my playthrough.) Not only does the game feel like a proof-of-concept of a game, there are tons of bugs and optomization problems (still). Thankfully the controller options work and the controls are fine.\n\n5.) I don't understand why create an aesthetic, a world, and cool designs for robots but give none of those things any bit of personality. If you were hopping for the Portal Coop Bots, think again. I just refer to them as the Suck Bot and the Boom Bot. That's all they do in the game, and there is no deviation or something to change up their mechanics.\n\nYou pick up boxes, you move them and suck up energy. (R3D)\n\nYou can't jump to save your life; you need R3D to give you a lift--with boxes--and the only fun you have is blowing stuff up, which can cause horrible screen-tearing effects. (BLU3)\n\n6.)  I don't understand how a Purist mode is all that interesting . I'll be upfront and say that I haven't played the "Hard Mode" setting. But I fail to see how, when you beat the main-game, conserving your energy bursts will be any more challenging. There aren't alternative paths or extra obstacles designed to make you backtrack. The only challenge is not misfiring early too much, which I never had a problem.\n\n7.) I don't understand how you can use one song, ONE, for the entire game with some variation. Yes, there are small differences and sound-effects thrown in, sometimes, but it still sounds like the same song. (Where is that trailer song? I have not heard anything like it. Nor have I seen the cutscenes.)\n\n8.) I don't understand how you make enemies pointless in a 2D game. Especially turrets. You can run through the enemies and not worry, so long as you don't stay too long in the camera's spotlight or you remember to jump past a turret.\n\n9.)I don't understand anything about the lore because no context is given to me.  I played UP to chapter three and gave up because I didn't get one clue of context about who am I, what am I doing, why is everything trying to destroy me, and why should I care.\n\nGoing To Be Brutally Honest\nThis game is boring and fails to engaged the player(s) either as a cooperative game or a puzzle-platformer itself. This game needs to be scrapped and started over again. If you're going to use 2.5D elements for gameplay, just make it a 3D platformer instead.\n\nThere is a far shortage of those kind of games from indie-games and maybe the gameplay might be better suited with larger environments. You might even expand upon the game's intial ideas into something unique and well-worthy for cooperative play.","October 25, 2015","false","3.4"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","1"
