One of the original space shooters, Galaga was approachable in ways that most top down shooters simply aren’t, and I was able to get better and better as the years went on and I kept returning to it. I feel like a lot of the games in that tradition nowadays are still in the mindset of wowing arcade onlookers with streams of bullets and floods of enemies. Vortex Attack is a bit different. It knows to start off slowly and go with a player’s pace, allowing pilots to get into a groove. There are still plenty of bullets to dodge, but the fast pace of the action and the multitude of weapons put the player on a balanced playing field, and the whole package reminds me of arcade games of yore rather than more modern dodging simulators.\n\nWant to know more?

Turns out i enjoyed it. There is a lot of varity between the different ships. Some are strong but slow or fast but weak ect.\n\nThere are differnt power ups like speed up. Rapid fire (though it's useless as you can mash on the key you have your fire button set to)  you have little helpers that you can collect that will shoot lasers and or other bullets and you can power them up as well for some extra damage.\n\nIf you get a really good set up try not to die. If you do die you loose all of your points (which is mean :3 )  So basically if you like spaceship shooters and want a challanging one i would go for this one. Its priced right  and its fun what more could you ask for?","July 1, 2015","true","5.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

However, as the difficulty builds up both concerns are eventually dispelled. In the end, reaching a score of over thirty million proved to be an extremely rewarding endeavor and one I would gladly partake in again.\n\nFull Review Here: http://www.tech-gaming.com/vortex-attack/","June 1, 2015","true","5.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"

Repeat until game ends. Or you end, whichever comes first.\n\nMechanicaly it seems fine, controls work, no complaints there. There's even a slow movement button, though I never felt like using it.\n\nThe game starts quite slow and takes a few stages to get going. Unfortunately, if you get plenty of power-ups along the way (which doesn't seem too hard), you'll be killing most enemies about as fast as they can spawn, along with a large percentage of enemy bullets (though not all can be destroyed). Your ship can take a few hits, and if you get a shield, well, who cares about bullets?\n\nNow while that's fun and all, it leaves me with little sense of threat, even when I'm messing up and getting myself killed, on the second-last stage. Aside from complacency, the main danger ends up being things invading your personal space, particularly things that are the same colour as the background, which is frustrating, but thankfully doesn't happen all the time.\n\nThere are also standard bosses and the traditional shooting gallery bonus levels, which are good to break up the gameplay, but not terribly exciting.\n\nNOTE: Only played with a couple of ships, there may be some that make things more interesting, but I'm bored already. also I don't have anyone to try multi.\n\nApart from poor visibility on some enemies, the graphics are pretty good and appropriately arcadey. Didn't notice the sound, so, good.\n\nOverall, it's not a bad game, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. Fans of the genre might well like it, but with so many similar games out there, you can probably find something better.","July 23, 2015","false","3.0"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","4"
