It is probably currently even the only one in existence, at least on steam. I wonder why nobody made one earlier. Sadly as a click and point game, it's kinda basic, also it has less puzzles and more story. The puzzles can get a bit confusing, but if you ever played a puzzle game then they shouldn't be a big problem. I had a nice time with it, but it very unpolished, and compared with the competition it just doesn't hold up.\n\nNegative:\n- a very low amount of any sound effects\n- the art doesn't really fit together, watercolor backgrounds but vector graphics characters\n- there is a low number of animations\n- your character sometimes clips throw the environment and even can get stuck\n- different types of speech bubbles (neutral, angry, thinking) would have been nice\n\nNeutral:\n~ short, about 3 hours\n~ dialog options / dialog puzzles would have been nice\n\nPositive:\n+ great soundtrack, every scene has it's own music\n+ the story is decent\n\nSimilar games I recommend:\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/207690\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/219910\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/40700\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/31270\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/205020","May 31","false","2.8"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

The puzzles in the game were fairly easy to understand, while maybe two of them were a bit confusing. The art style is very nice with a watercolour look and feel to it, a nice game to chill out and relax too. I'm not too sure about the price range on it so i recommend waiting for a decent sale discount for it before buying, however it was enjoyable nonetheless. A good start for people getting into point and click adventure games.\ni'd give this game a 7/10, fun and beautiful but quite easy to finish.","June 1","true","6.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The gameplay is really simple and you enter in the story directly (no long introduce like some games).\n\nThe graphics is special but good, the protagonist is endearing and cute, what allow the players to have more pleasure.\n\nThe puzzle is not too hard, not too easy, a perfect difficulty! And the “battle time” is really good!(maybe make a life bar for the enemies and more battle phase!).\nDisadvantages:\nReally short game, you can rush it in less than 2 hours.\nMany bugs :\n-Clic can pass 2 sentences, not only one.\n-at the chapter 6, the game has RAM.\n-at the end of chapter 5, after the cut scène, the chapter 6 cannot load.\n-at the first puzzle, when you at on the generator before put the things in, you can’t leave the place after.\nWhen you save, you save only the place where you are, for example for the chapter 5, if you have the bug, if you reload it, you reload at the beginning of this chapter (thanks to the “skip” button)\nConclusion:\nRP is good but can be much better! He has a good potential what ask to be use!\nGreat work but work in progress.","June 3","true","9.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
