Once you step through The Last Door, it will take you and you will want to come back.\n\n","October 29, 2015","true","4.2"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","15","16","0","0"

Instead of playing as Devitt, you now play as his former psychiatrist, Dr Wakefield. In four episodes, the game tells the story of Wakefield searching for Devitt across four different locations. It is during these episodes that you learn about what happened prior to the events of season one -- although most of the flashbacks are only in the final episode.\n\nIF you thought that season one was too short, you're going to be happy that they fixed that in season two. In season one, you would just stick to one place in season one in every episode. In season two, you can travel to SEVERAL locations on a map in every episode (except for the last one, but given the plot at that time, it's probably best not to go anywhere).\n\nIt's been developed by the same group of people and their formula of an amazing season one has been reused in season two. Music is atmospheric and beautiful (as expected) and fits perfectly within the game. Graphics still pixelated but the development team seems to have hit the nail on the head again. The game looks wonderful in general (if you can look past the fact that everything's pixelated) but compared to season one, everything somehow seems prettier. They haven't changed anything important about gameplay (if it ain't broke, don't fix it) but they have added some interesting features, like puzzles.\n\nIn short, the game has the same feel to it as season one but the dev team managed to make it more than just a sequel.\n\nAlthough it will probably not be as well-known as season one (I only found this game by sheer coincidence), it's still an incredibly well-made game and if you're into the genre, this game is a must-have.\n\nPros:\n- Additional features compared to s1\n- Astonishing graphics\n- Fantastic music\n- Good continuation of story\n\nCons:\n- Few bugs\n\nRating: Solid 9.5/10 - get it whenever you can.\n\n(Sidenote: I made a guide! It's a walkthrough to the game and contains achievements as well. If you're ever lost, you can take a quick look at it.)\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=604795925","March 31","true","18.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

(Only Ken plays it) But I'm sure, that this game would be one of the best pixelated-horror experiences you ever play. Definitely worth it. The graphics are intentionally bad, but that's what makes the game so good. Limited vision is one of the best mechanics in pixelated-horror games because as you can't see what is it, you get freaked out. The music is also spectacular and it really sets the mood of the scenario (Though it will be better to reuse some of the pieces from season 1? So to get some nostalgia kicking  in?) And most importantly, Story. It is what drives Wakefield deeper into the mystery; It is what makes Wakefield's motive of keenly investigating such a case; and It is why you should play this. Definitely worth it. Really want to see Markiplier playing it.\n\n(And it would be better to release a Mac version as well in the future)\n(EDIT: 29 Mar 2016. Mac version is released.

Lovecraft, buy this game.\n\nIn far longer summation. It is rare that I decide to write a review of a game, but in the case of The Last Door Season 2, I am pleased to make an exception to this policy.  I do not speak idly when I say that this is one of the best games I have played in the last few years.  Certainly the graphical style is not to everyone's taste, but I found that it fit the game in a way I cannot quite describe.  Yet I fear I am rambling, so allow me to lay out, in a concise a manner as possible, why I liked this game.  It is of course, not completely without flaws, such as the occasional moment where the game behaved strangely when I was picking up objects (such as the umbrella in Episode 3), but these are the pettiest of quibbles.\n\nI. The atmosphere.  This game has a superb atmosphere and sense of place that draws the player into the world and the story. It builds suspense, and manages to be unnerving with a graphical style that I am afraid to admit I initially sneered at.\nII. The story. Naturally, one should play Season 1 before Season 2, in order to experience the story.  It is taught, well crafted, and creates a fascinating world and lore all its own.  It is perhaps the best Lovecraftian I have ever seen in a game (and that includes the vaunted Bloodborne).\nIII. The music.  The soundtrack to this game is one of the best I have ever heard.  While, as with all things, this is a manner of taste, I found the music to be excellently composed, and to fit the mood of the game to a T.\n\nIn conclusion, to anyone who enjoys Point & Click Adventures, horror games, H.P. Lovecraft, or even classical music, I must recommend this game.   During a time where Steam is increasinly deluged by blindingly unoriginal two bit horror games, it is a joy to see something like this.","March 30","true","11.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The Last Door: Season 2 is an excellent and satisyfing completion to the weird tale that began in season one. Everything I wrote in my review of the first game stands true for this one. The mood, the atmosphere, and the writing serve the source material extremely well, and the development and reveal of all the major plot points are handed well.\n\nWhen we last saw Dr. Wakefield he was searching for his patient, Jeremiah Devitt, who disappeared while searching for answers that led to the suicide of his friend, Anthony Beechworth. The game starts from an entirely different character's perspective, giving the game both a nested and varied narrative that is a classic of weird fiction tales. While replaying the first game again, and now this one I took notes in order to link the various plot points together and ensure that I was completely entrenched in the story. The writers really created a fascinating and weaving narrative that takes place over many years and is told perfectly through this series of episodes.\n\nJust as the first season, the Last Door Season 2 is a point and click adventure game that is the amalgamation of influences from many of the giants of weird and horror fiction including Poe, Lovecraft, Chambers, Machen, and Mauppasant. It's a fascinating and intriguing story mixed with very fun point and click mechanics, and one of the most atmospheric and engaging point and click games I've played. The pixel graphics are very effective for suggesting a simple and pleasing Victorian tone while creating a distant feeling of ambiguous disconnect which, when combined with the incredible soundtrack, heightens the sense of tension and unknown. Each of the settings in the game work extremely well as the structure on which to hang the atmosphere and mystery.\n\nThe first half of The Last Door set up the characters, major themes and the mystery, and this season delivers on all fronts. The music continues to deliver, as does the story. As in the first seasons, there are four episodes, as well as one 'extra' episode that can be played upon completion of the game. Each of these episodes took me a little over an hour each to complete. Again, it's highly dependent the player's ability to solve the puzzles which can occasionally prove strangely challenging (in the one or two instances where the solutions feel contrived). Thankfully this only happens once or twice, and the territory to cover by the player isn't that large so exploration isn't too much of a problem. The mini-episode serve to heighten the story and takes only a few minutes to complete. The real draw here, especially for fans of the first season, is the conclusion of the well-written story.\n\nThe only negative, as I've written in my first review, and this is a far too oft seen trait in point and click games, are the sometimes extremely contrived item uses in order to solve puzzles. It rings hollow when you are required to utilize an item in an extremely odd way that even the character in the game may consider with raised eyebrows.\n\nWith that said, this concludes one of my favorite weird fiction series, and one that I offer my strongest recommendation to. It's one of the most true spirited games based on the weird fiction genre that I've played. I've no doubt that I'll return to this series eventually to experience it all again, and will look forward to any similar games this design team produces.","April 28","true","11.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you're looking for Lovecraft, Edgar Poe or Kafka-type unease, madness and horror, look no further than The Last Door. And play both seasons chronologically.\n\nSeason 2 seems to be a definite finale to the storyline that began in Season 1 (of course, with possible new games set in the same universe) and answers all the questions that needed answers, without ruining the unspeakbleness of horrors you encounter, leaving them still beyond your understanding. The story feels trailing off guidelessly at times, unlike Season 1, where it always felt like it was more bits of the same story. But it's still interesting, told in a great way that mixes story and puzzle bits without breaking the pace all that much. There are few moments where I felt that I was starting to wonder aimlessly not noticing a necessary item/dialogue trigger to move the game forward, but those moments were rare and didn't ruin the experience in any way. There were also several simple non-game-breaking bugs that will probably get fixed soon. With only big complaint remaining from the previous Season - that you can't really skip scenes if you're replaying the episode and want to find something you might've missed or just to re-experience specific moments. Still, amazing atmospheric horror story game.","March 30","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As before, the resolution is so inhumanly low it must lie at the bottom of some unfathomable Stygian pit, reveling in the gelid touch of the rugose abominations that squirm so thickly about it, biding its time, occasionally emitting a liquid chortle . . . Even with pixels so few and -- dare I utter it -- cyclopean, it's an evocative style that tells us all we need to know and more; a fuller glimpse, after all, might send our fragile psyches reeling into the oblivion of existential madness!  Having subjected my own frail mind to Season 2, I am compelled to step back and marvel at the heights that can be reached by willfully plummeting into the jagged depths of low fidelity.  The retro experimentation must continue!\n\nI was very surprised at some of the twists the story took, but very pleased to be so, as it never lost the low, infernal thrum of Lovecraftian horror:  a mode in which suggestion and slowly layered atmosphere predominate over messy vivisection.  Thankfully, the English localization has vastly improved over the first half, leaving us to sort out this dense and intelligent weird tale without the added stumbling block of "accented English."  The puzzles are slightly more complex than in the first season, but never veer far from the easy side of the scale.  It's more about the experience -- the sense of tense exploration and dreaded discovery -- rather than the challenge, anyway.\n\nAn excellent achievement in both low-fi artwork and interactive Lovecraftianism!  An absolute must-play (after you've gone through Season 1, of course)!","April 18","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
