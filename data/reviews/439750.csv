To go the whole game without appreciating the size and history of the world is rather difficult, though it does allow enough blank spaces for you to both be surprised at new things and to create your own speculations.\nThe character interaction in the story is largely optional but highly rewarding due to the narrative focus, with many faces coming in and out of importance and speciality as you push the story forward. The decison to give each companion their own sidequest was an intelligent decision that is enhanced by their hinting at within the first installment, giving each their own gravity and importance. After each is completed, each character makes a distinct shift from traditional dnd class scarecrows to pretty 3-dimensional people, with their own history and hangups and flaws. One such example is a cleric companion whos initial religious tendencies seem surface level and zealotrous, only to be revealed as a result of coping with a pervasive fear of the unknown after a childhood encounter with a vampire.\n\nOverall, give this game a chance.\nIts really cheap,\nIts well written,\nand you'll start to feel things again.\n\nwoohoo","January 31","true","8.7"," 24 of 25 people (96%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","96","24","25","3","0"

Don't get me wrong. This game was written very,very,very well by a writer with good reputation and good CYOA games. But I didnt hit me right. I played the first one the COG website and transferred save file to second one after I have been 'encouraged' by the website.\n\nI recapped the first one by replaying since I didnt save at the website. From first one to second, the transition was like 'In your face'. Felt very forceful. My stats from first barely scrapped into second. Just glimpses and once or twice peeking. From an adventure to political war,with sudden surge of new characters that just accepted me as an heir with no reason whatsoever and let me jump straight into getting the throne back, it just did not feel right for me.\n\nMy playthrough in Lost Heir 1 seemed like a damn waste of time. Only your stats of weapons are regularly checked. But when somehow there is stat check, it is very harsh. It has almost 3 or 4 stats simultaneously checked with high value nonetheless.\n\nAs a standalone title, this is a very good CYOA game but as a sequel, I am hugely disappointed. This is my opinion only, some may actually like it or maybe I just didnt play very well since I tried it to be my own adventure.\n\n4/10 A heir has lost indeed. The heir of a unfullfilling sequel emerged.","January 30","false","2.7"," 20 of 31 people (65%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","65","20","31","3","1"

I thought it was pretty good. People are complaining that the choices are to attoined to what you did in the first one, but I think it's great. That means your choices in the first game actually had meaning and you now are starting to see it. It's not that long, but it's definately not short, and the time adds up when you have three different characters to play through. Worth every penny. (Especially since I got in on sale for a dollar cheaper)","January 31","true","5.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

Worry not if you did not buy or play part 1 prior to getting this though, for even if you did not play the first part of the trilogy, it's possible to start with a brand-new character here - though it's worth noting that doing so means you'll start without what bonuses and whatnot you can pick up in TLH1, so it might be a bit of an uphill battle.\n\nThe game itself can be divided up into three parts. The first part is where we left off at the end of the first part of the trilogy, with the main character being an adventurer in hiding after his/her confrontation with the villain, so you'll find yourself in a familiar enough spot before things go on to more complicated stuff. The second part is the whole 'Forging a Kingdom' bit, where you must retake your kingdom and strenghten it for the inevitable confrontation with you and your allies on one side and Zusak and his cronies on the other one. The third and last part centers around the military campaign against Zusak and his cronies. While the first part of the game feels familiar enough, the later two will introduce a few new aspects that you must consider carefully if you want to end up victorious.  If that makes you feel uneasy because you were more a fan of the adventuring aspect of the first game, then there's no need to worry, as the later two parts offers some adventuring as well, to different degrees.\n\nUnlike the first game, this game has very few artifacts for you to uncover, but there are other things to uncover! Prestige classes that unlocks new and exciting possibilities! Cool mounts that makes even the most expensive warhorse from back in the first game pale in comparison! The companions that we came to know and love in Fall of Daria also makes a return here, with arguable more sparse but also so much more meaningful and worthwhile moments of interaction with them and one or two of them even having a surprise or two in store for you!\n\nThe Lost Heir: Forging a Kingdom is a game first and foremostly recommended to those who liked the first part of the trilogy, but also to those who like fantasy and CYOAs like this, with an arguably mostly linear story, but nonetheless full of options for exactly who and what your Player Character is - and who knows where your choices will carry you to the very end...? Very much recommended as far as I'm concerned in any event!","February 2","true","24.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

As the middle chapter of a triology, the stakes are higher and things get worse. Much, much worse. After all, if the protagonist triumps in the second act the third act would be redundant.\n\nFollowing the events of "The Fall of Daria", it is the tale of how your character comes into his/her own. The excellent writing abides but now the stakes are even higher. Taking back your birthright was never going to be easy and now your fresh-faced youth of 18 has to lead an army regardless of how well such a person would realistically fare. That is not a knock on their age mind you, Alexander of Macedon had accomplished much by the time he was 18. Rather the personality you invested into your character might jive with the idea of them being a leader of men, women, women who dress like men and things that look like men.\n\nOne thing I found appetizing is the feeling of real progress for your character. Political power aside, your character can feel seriously formidable at times. Being able to one-shot a giant with a lightning bolt truly contrasts to the time when you struggled to face down a single troll. However the weakness of the system rears its ugly head again and it is even more pronounced this time around. Execerbated by the fact that it is possible to max out your core stats by the middle of the game, many stat checks are very harsh and some are flat out impossible to make. Few are game ending but it is illustrated early on. If you have neither a thief or magician in your party, it is impossible to avoid killing innocent guardsmen when attempting a jailbreak. Unless you are willing to fork over a large some of money. Keeping to the adage any good gamemaster knows, that keeping your characters poor is the root of all adventure, money becomes more useful as a tool of commerce rather than to buy shiny new toys for your character to play with. Sometimes I felt that I was effectively financing my army out of my own pockets since I personally paid for almost half of our provisions during our campaign. I do think that this is a good thing, giving you meaningful means to spend money when your inventory is usually full, still it does feel slightly incongruous that a single adventurer can effectively be the financial lifeline of an army.\n\nUnlike the previous game though, you never get your hands on useful enchanted gear. That was a facet I truly enjoyed in the original title but now, although my character is recognized as royalty, I hardly stumble across anything worthwhile materially. Indeed, acquiring key items in the previous title will make this one much, much easier. Suddenly echoes of Lone Wolf assail me and part of me wonders if the third part will be much the same.","February 2","true","9.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
