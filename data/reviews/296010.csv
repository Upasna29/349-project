"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CueZero/recommended/296010/","CueZero","CueZero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CueZero/","1640 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThere have been quite a few attempts at recreating the 6DoF formula as of late, and none of them really do it for me with their attempts to over-complicate the core elements and make things "modern". NeonXSZ is the first game of its kind in a long time to really hook me in with its potpourri of elements that we know are fun and addictive, and have withstood the test of time. It combines the freedom of movement and perspective of Descent and the edge-of-your-seat twitch action of Quake or Unreal Tournament with the addictive leveling and persistent loot of increasing rarity of an ARPG like Diablo, all combining for what is absolutely the most addictive and replayable shooter of any kind in years.\n\nThe game places you into a vast and complex computer mainframe with a very open and free-form approach to exploration. There's a great in-depth tutorial to read at your own pace getting you into the motions, but you are more-or-less thrown into this world blind with no hand-holding involved and a great deal of content to discover on your own accord. While there is no hand-holding the game does not ever feel tedious or hard to get into even for the newest of players, as you are always being guided the right way thanks to the Appropriate Hostile function which will highlight on your map the best spot to hit next for your newest dose of weapons and upgrades. This makes exploration of the almost overwhelmingly large Station quick and accessible, as you are still lost but pointed in the right direction.\n\nThe objective of NeonXSZ is discovery and total domination, as you vie for control and power over the various hubs spread throughout the world in all-out territorial war. Despite the open-ended form of gameplay, NeonXSZ is ridiculously easy to get into for players of any skill level thanks to an approachable and flexible learning curve. This is gained through giving the player full control over which enemies and hubs they tackle on, giving the ability to scan hostiles for their level before deciding to engage or flee. As you fight higher leveled enemies you start to feel more confident, you'll return to bases with your hard-earned loot and become even stronger leading to newer and more challenging areas. The amount of content you have to explore is massive and already offers a minimum of 30 hours of feature complete gameplay with more to come.\n\nI had already drifted around the computerized world for a few good hours exploring, taking on low leveled hostiles, and playing around with early equipment before I discovered the challenge arenas at the center of the Station in a massive sphere. This is where ♥♥♥♥ gets serious. Instead of analyzing and picking off single similarly leveled foes like in the main world, I was suddenly thrust into a large and complex series of challenging areas being bombarded by difficult but manageable enemies. Each lovingly detailed room was blocked off by a shield and every one of these persistent opposing ships had to be exterminated diligently in an intense and explosive battle in order to advance. The loot you get is of game-changing quality (depending on the level of the arena) and in high quantities, and defeating an arena allows you to claim territory on that Station for an allied side of your choosing.\n\nLeveling up your tech level isn't as simple as gaining experience points or grinding mobs of same-y enemies like in other games, in NeonXSZ leveling up is determined by the quality of parts you're discovering and equipping. In order to grow strong enough to take on tougher foes, you'll need to outfit your ship with a select choice of higher leveled upgrades all dependent on the players' own playstyle. The range of different parts and the effect they have on how the game feels and plays is insane, and allows you to be anything from a slow, hulking tank with tons of shields and firepower to an agile and lightning-quick smaller ship that avoids all damage with ninja-like reflexes in the hands of the sharp-witted.\n\nWeapons are another integral part of NeonXSZ and just like upgrades add a huge layer of player customization and personal technique to how combat is approached. You start with the standard pea-shooter in classic shootemup fashion, but are quickly presented with plenty of choices in how you take on your combatants. For the nimble and stealthy pilots who like to sneak up and get in close there's the Lightning Gun which packs a serious punch but drains your energy like crazy, and a Flak Cannon which spreads out for a wide shot but shreds anything in its direct path. For the sniper-minded you have the Railgun which requires the the most accuracy but disintegrates enemy ships almost instantaneously. There's Inferno Guns for taking your foes down in a firey blaze and Laser Cannons that deliver a shocking blast of energy from afar, all weapons I've discovered only in my first 25 hours of gametime and with more to be found. The arsenal in NeonXSZ is remarkable, and will keep the most seasoned action veteran captivated for hours.\n\nThe heavy mechanical beats and ambient dronings of the background music do an excellent job of keeping you engaged in the atmosphere of the cybernetic and neon-tinted highways around you. In general the sound design to me is very engrossing with its muffled sound effects and outside explosions giving you the feeling of truly being inside the cockpit. Some people might not be huge fans of the ships speaking A.I. system dubbed 'Betty', but personally I feel it adds to the retrofuture aesthetics of the setting and the authenticity of the interactive and immersive cockpit you become all too familiar with. Perhaps with just a bit more variation in speech, Betty would be welcomed by more players.\n\nIf you're looking for lightning-quick combat, huge series of interconnected arenas, and ludicrous amounts of customization then look no further, NeonXSZ is your next addiction. It's an already feature complete game with many hours of solid content, loads of replayability, and an amazing amount of polish. The games' state in Early Access is merely a sign of the tremendous amount of additional potential for an already mind-blowing shooter experience.","August 8, 2014","true","48.0"," 57 of 68 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","57","68","0","3"

I normally dont get into games that dont have much storyline and are more or less team deathmatch vs. the computer, however this games pace mixed with a rather competitive AI makes it a very enjoyable experience.  The game difficulty can be adjusted to fit prefered play style and i must admit being a fan of tron the visuals in the game are very appealing.","February 22","true","3.8"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","21","23","3","4"

The game can be challenging, with a robust amount of upgrades for the player to experiment with for a long long time. With excellent flight controls, exciting dog fights, and lots to explore, NeonXSZ is a game with a ton of "meat" and depth. There is a small learning curve to get over, but once you get the hang of it, the game opens up. NeonXSZ is also incredibly impressive with buttons on your ship's hud actually functional, to the overall visual and sound effects. I felt as though I was in the ship piloting my enemies destruction.\n\nThe Aesthetics and sound is well suited to the overall theme of the game. Though the textures are rather basic, the lighting, design, and style makes up for it. The sound of course is full of beeps and boops, and robot voices, as you would expect from a cyber punk game. It's done well, and works with the game's theme.\n\nTo sum how the game plays out in a nut shell, you go around, exploring your environment, hunting down enemy ships, blow them up, and collect their valuable. Then you take those valuable and make new upgrades for your ship. Rinse, find new space stations, and repeat. The game is quite grindy, and I would even argue that it's designed around the grind. People like myself who don't mind the grind as long as it's well designed will welcome this, but those who are more sensitive to grindy games, it's worth your time to do a little more research before committing to a purchase.\n\nOverall NeonXSZ is an enjoyable exploratory flight RPG, with lots of customization. Even though it is pretty grindy in nature, the game is deep and versatile enough to hold my attention. I recommend NeonXSZ\n\nPros:\n- Deep and varied amounts of customization\n- Challenging gameplay\n- Easy to understand flight controls\n- Very immersive\n- Has that "addictive" quality\n- Cyber punk your brains out\n\nCons:\n- Lack of graphical options\n- Lack of side features\n- People sensitive to grinds may be put off","August 18, 2014","true","7.4"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","22","26","0","2"

I was the first pre-alpha tester and I've submitted the most bug reports. I know the game. When I started it was great, and it has just been improved a lot in every area since then. I have played for hundreds of hours if you qount all the non-steam dev builds and while I have tried a lot of different ship loadouts there are still many ships and loadouts that I want to try but haven't because new things to try is added all the time :) And this is true even after I've played past the levels where new qontent is unlocked for every progression!\n\nMany gadgets and abilities can have a playstyle centered on their use or their combination with other abilities. You can be a missile ship that shoots long range missiles around your energy wall. You can use a fast glass cannon build that does most of it's damage by bumping into your enemies and survives by dodging enemy fire and short invulnerability that lasts just long  enough for you to get the kill because you have spent all your resources on damage instead of defense. You can make a turret ship that just flies through the enemy base while placing a bunch of turrets and survives with a gyro shield that protects your back. When you turrets are placed you hide in tunnels and behind debris and kill everything without even shooting them yourself. You can build something that takes advantage of several abilities without relying on a single one of them or spend all your upgrades on boosting your speed, attack and defense and takes down any type of enemy with perfect aim at long or short range with circle strafing in 3 dimensions.\n\nAll this and much more is possible for you and your enemies to use! Then there are all the weapons and ship hulls that also each require it's own tricks, loadouts and playstyles. You don't need to qommit to one style throughout the game, instead you can switch at any time! You carry all your weapons at once and can switch out your whole loadout as often as you want even while on a hunt for loot deep in enemy territory, just dock in a garage!\n\nIf you don't feel like hunting down enemies in the open world and setting your own goals then you can now fly to the world hub/fighting center sphere (figurativly and literally) where there are prescripted challenge arenas with moving parts and level design handcrafted for the enemy waves and the loadout you meet in there.  Each level is a very unique experience and might require you to learn new tactics. The reward for completing the arenas is good enough that you can progress through the game mostly by these linear levels if you want to, or you can just ignore them whenever you feel like flying through the open world.\n\nThough the challange arenas are a part of the open world and you can fly from them to any other place without any loading screens at all. Whenever you want to do something you fly to the appropriate place and just do it, you never have to select what to do from a level select screen.\n\nNeonXSZ feels great, looks great, is fun and addictive. Every enemy you enqounter is using the same upgrades, hulls and gadgets that you can unlock and you can unlock it by qollecting the pieces of their wreck. Battles in NeonXSZ are never a repetitive grind, instead the AI is made to fight lika a human player which fits great in a first person shooter! They aim, move, utilize tactics and gadgets based on their personality and they design different loadouts. Since they are playing by the same rules as you it's possible to even learn from them and pick up tactics that they use.\n\nIf you like 6DOF FPS games that requires some skill (though there's at least 4 ways to adjust the difficulty to suit anyone) and want to avoid boring grind then this is The Game! Fun from the start!\n\nIf you want to hear about what the dev is doing with the game today you can follow his devlog (on the game forums at NeonXSZ.com) that is updated daily.\n\nSo yes, I do recommend this game :]","July 28, 2014","true","109.3"," 26 of 35 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","26","35","0","0"

I've been playing this game since about mid-2013 and put hundreds of hours put in and can say it's quite the fun game. The art style is simple, yet it doesn't leave you feeling like there needs to be more. It's set up so you can just pick it up and start doing your own thing; you learn how to play by just playing and messing around with things.\n\nAs you gradually level up your ship you start getting better too; your accuracy improves, your streaks get higher, opponents get tougher and so on. There's different ships that you can swap parts in and out of to get them just how you play. Like going in fast and taking them head on? There's a build for that. More of a heavy hitter who can rail small ships in a single shot? There's a build for that too!\n\nThen there's the challenge arenas, they're just that: a challenge. At first they're pretty difficult, but you want to beat it because there's no way you're going to let them do whatever it is that they do! So you go out and build your ship to your specifications and start earning uranium and nanotubes and you march right back in there and kick the living crap out of them! Your/their plans for system domination have been succeeded/foiled! Now what? Well, there seems to be a couple more arenas and they're all above your level. So you go back out, kick more ♥♥♥, take more upgrades and push you and your ship right to the edge. That's pretty much how it all starts, so go kick some ♥♥♥ and build your story :)","July 28, 2014","true","8.8"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

Now imagine that commercial except it's mixing Descent and Diablo. And the two guys are kvetching and I come along in my tech 22 ship and kill them both and loot bubbles pop out of them.\n\nNow, the game isn't perfect (no game is)--I wish there were a campaign, but it's very solidly a sandbox style experience. That said, the actual gameplay is phenomenal. The "shipfeel" is spot on; it's genuinely a ton of fun to kill dudes and take their loot bubbles. I've dropped twenty hours into it since a friend picked it up for me as a Christmas gift, and all twenty hours have been a blast.\n\nDescent gameplay plus diablo sensibilities equals you should buy this.","January 3","true","110.0"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","13","14","0","1"

It is absolutely packed with gameplay and player choice, is highly polished and very configurable, both in terms of game settings and aesthetics (how many games do you have that let you change the theme of the game world?).\n\nIt's a mouse driven 6DOF shooter (yes, mouse and keyboard is by far the best control method) in an open world cyberspace environment, so even though you have an ultimate goal you also have a high degree of flexibility in how you achieve it.  New ship components and even new ships are introduced at the perfect rate and make you feel always like you're making steady progress.  Two (well, four) warring factions make things even more exciting...rarely do you fly for more than a minute without encountering some firefight taking place that you can ignore or join as you wish.\n\nIn short, NeonXSZ is a pure joy to play.  It's pretty, it's fun, it's packed with options...if you asked me what typical 6DOF shooters need I couldn't tell you any more than NeonXSZ already has.  It's a stunning example of the genre - a revolution, really - and an incredible achievement for the one-man dev team.","February 22","true","13.8"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","19","25","0","0"

The RPG and customization elements are crazy addictive, and the alien atmosphere and soundtrack are perfect. Amazingly polished for an Early Access title. All of the settings and HUD elements can seem overwhelming at first, so can the controls (fully remappable), but part of the joy of the game is discovering and experimenting with them.

A one-of-a-kind RPG-FPS mash-up that's refreshingly free of fluff and boring bits, due to an easily traversable game world and consistently exciting combat.

So even if you have the option of picking up standard kill or fedex missions at every shop, the point is to get into the action and, well, kill the bad guys.\n\nWith every hour I played I came to appreciate more and more the incredible care and skill with which the (interactive) cockpit has been designed, conveying a huge amount of information without it ever feeling cluttered (I wish flight simulator cockpits were optimized like this!). The graphical quality of the environment and the effects is astounding and makes this EA game totally feel like an AAA title (let alone that I have never met with a single bug since I bought it). Adding to this, you can even customize the environment colors so that nothing will hurt your eyes as you hunt (including flipping the color of the enemies to a different high-contrast choice).\n\nThere is no standard in-game tutorial but the learning curve is very gentle because the low level enemies are push-overs and, besides, you can customize the difficulty curve to just where you like it (even the travel speed can be lowered, so that you don't need to be worried about this being a twitch-game that shuts you off if you lack Korean-like reflexes. The many colorful, detailed in-game help pages have been added recently and provide all the information one needs, and the rest can always be learned from exploration and trial and error (it helps that the death penalty is very mild, inviting you to go back into the action with no regrets). So even if the ultra-detailed cockpit may at first overwhelm, don't worry, keep killing the bad guys because it will grow on you and one day you will be able to immediately find the info you need where you want it.\n\nFinally, speaking of levels and longevity, I have been taking in the sights and enjoying the leveling-up of my ships' components, so that after 16 hours I am still at level 12 or so, while I understand that one can work it up to 80! Seems like a huge amount of play value to me and so, summing it up, now that I recently passed the 500 game mark in my Steam collection I have never before seen a 'small' indie game done with such an incredible attention to detail and one that I could more sincerely recommend to all loot-addicted space flight fans in need of a high-quality fix. I know that we have been repeatedly disappointed by a number of Freelancer lookalikes in the past several years, so while we wait why not take this gift of a perhaps less ambitious, yet amazingly satisfying game?\n\nIf anything in this review resonates with you, please do yourself a favor and give NeonXSZ a try - it won't cost you a dime, and it will probably suck you in.","August 17, 2015","true","24.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

You're plopped into the middle of a sandbox of dogfighting, and need to gradually master all six of your degrees of freedom if you want to get anywhere.  Customizable difficulty, lots of upgrades and weapons and ships to play with, and fun challenge arenas and procedurally-generated tasks make for a fast-paced, player-driven experience.  Nice bright high-contrast visuals pay homage to Tron and are highly customizable, and the low penalty for death (at first) encourages you to keep extending beyond what you think you're capable of, to never play things too safe.\n\nWhat you'll discover as you get farther is that everything you're doing consumes your main currency, uranium.  Whenever you thrust needlessly, or fire weapons without thinking, you're consuming uranium, which is also used to respawn, to purchase upgrades, and to use teleporters.  You can gain it by doing tasks and killing enemies, but as you move up along the power curve, you're forced to learn more advanced, more elegant and efficient, techniques.  Failing to use your power responsibly, or trying to farm things that are way below your level for too long, could put you in danger of not having enough energy to respawn, should you die.  The way the game nudges you gradually toward both this realization and to increasing challenge and player skill is pretty brilliant.","April 26","true","11.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Been more into space flight simulators like Wing Commander, Elite, and Freelancer. This is more like "spaceships in the matrix" 6DoF style. There are four factions in the game. You start out as friends with the OS and Anti-Virus factions, and enemies of Viruses and Malware. You can flip that and friend the other factions while making enemies of the former depending how you choose to play the game. Friending the Viruses and Malware is the more difficult option, though.\n\nThere are many ships in this game and plenty of ways to upgrade them. Each ship has a set amount of slots and slot types. There are many varieties of modules to slot into them making how you set your ship up quite diverse in the way it can be played. Everything is very well balanced. I don't feel I'm out of place when I'm fighting things my level. I've been playing this since it came out on early access and the progress has been quite wonderful. It's not buggy at all.

This is such a fun game for so many different types of people like for casual players to hop in and out for a short amount of shooting or even with the hardcore gamers being able to play this for long periods with things to do.","August 7, 2014","true","3.3"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

Even though it's still in development I just can recommend it to anyone who likes space-simulations and/or Rogue-like games.\nI first had to get a grip on the controls. Normally I don't play space-sims. I only played Free Space 2 back in the day.\nThe concept that your equipment defines your level is not a whole new concept, but I really like it, so it just adds to the game itself, that this functions very well.\nThe difficulty is pretty much adjustable to your liking. I actually play on the second easiest difficulty level cause I still have to learn and the learning curve is first pretty high. You have to learn, which enemies you can beat with what level. In addition you should know your weapons. Most time i play with the plasma cannon since i got it. Still have a long way to get the railgun I actually desire.\nEven if I only played 6 hourse when I wrote this, the still was awesome. Problem is, that I don't have much time for most of my games so I only play the most once a month or so. Still I got a really good impression from NeonXSZ.\nI just can recommend it to anyone who likes rogue-like and wants something like that in space.","September 25, 2014","true","6.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

As this is being made by a former Rockstar employee, I am not surprised that when a new version is released, it will be rock solid stable.\n\nThat being said, this is a bloody good game. Think "Descent meets Tron meets Borderlands", and that would sum up the experience I have with this game. Flying around ala Descent in a computer world ala Tron. Enemy ships will drop parts of its code for weapons, gadgets and other stuff for loot as well as much needed uranium (money and ship power) and carbon tubes (overclocking) like you het from the Borderlands franchise. Not to mention the vendors where you can buy and sell items. The challenge sphere is a nice addition and tests your mettle.\n\nThe one man Intravenous Software has done a very good job here.

There is something about this game that grabs you and makes you want to master it. I really like the developers choice to make the game as easy or as hard as suites your mood at the time. The balance between difficulty and boring is really well done. Finally, the ability to reskin and change the look of the whole game is pretty cool and helpful in different lighting conditions.\n\nThe developer says it's "early access", but it feels more like a complete game to me. No real show-stoppers bugs, nothing that doesn't feel "complete". In short, it's not the sort of "early-access" where you are a beta tester and have to go to the googles to figure out work arounds or where your save games will be deleted on a regular basis.\n\nI feel like this game is very appropriately priced and worth the money.\n\nI suppose the only critique I have for this game is that, as of now, it doesn't have much integration with steam. No achievements, cards or workshop support.

It's honestly what I dream about at night. Growing up playing games like Terminal Velocity and Raptor, I loved taking down enemies and having their guts spill out with that oh-so-delicious loot.\n\nEnter NeonXSZ:\n\nThis 6DoF gunship-shooter is absolutely fantastic on almost every level. From a gameplay perspective: the combat feels tight, responsive, and impactful. The movement is crisp, clean, and fluid. The enemies are predictable when they should be and brutal when you get in over your head. It becomes very satisfying to, like a small fish in a huge pond, creep along to your appropriate feeding grounds and lay waste, only to escape before the bigger predators lumber along to peck you off like the easy picking you are. It then becomes even more satisfying to turn around on those same buttmunches who drilled you into the ground earlier and blow them out of the sky. And even the loot itself is well designed. Does the enemy ship have that thing on it? It'll drop that thing. Every time. Well... parts of it anyway.\n\nThe UI is very daunting at first, but easily understood once you take the time to pause, by simply right-clicking I might add, and take a look around. You're a pilot, damnit! Not a surgeon! You have to orient yourself with the tools before you go off willy-nilly. This can be one of the pitfalls of the game. There is no real "tutorial" to speak of, other than just reading the manuals in the menu. Like any roguelike, you learn the hard way. By exploding. Over and over again. The various missions you take on will lead you across the entire map, leading you to sometimes choose between a quick ship, or a hearty ship.\n\nAnd the world... My gods, the world. First of all, I love the aestetic. You're inside of a computer. Of course it looks like that. And since you have the ability to customize the colors, to an extent, of both your ship and the world itself, you'd be hard pressed to find a style you DON'T like. And that's to say nothing of the expansiveness of it.\n\nOverall, I would say that NeonXSZ is a must-have for anyone who loves Diablo-style loot, tight flight mechanics, bright lights and fancy colors, or any combination of the three. And at a $20 price point, you'll be making a smart investment.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzrHK0xbts0","February 22","true","11.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

At least at first glance. Based on the omni-directional shooting mechanics of Descent, this game has you placed in a wheel-like, radial cyberspace map filled with allies and enemies. The story is also very uncomplicated, to the degree where I'm not too aware of what it is. It seems that you are battling malware entities in a cyberspace environment, but I could be very wrong.\nThe keystone for this game is the combat, which is very good. There are a wide variety of weapons, ships, and special modules for said ships, making customization nicely nuanced for your speedy little fighter whizzing across the map. There is a strightforward progression system, where your engines, shields, and fuel expand continually through mods you gain from killing enemies. It's very old-school Diablo in its loot-based gameplay: Kill enemeis, get upgrades, kill bigger enemies.\nThe combat ranges from flying through cyber-tunnels while blasting enemies with a lightning gun to engaging with intense dogfights with four or more foes in enclosed, contsantly shifting arenas. It feels excellent, and the game tracks your stats with every inevitable death, allowing you to track your skill as well. The ships UI is also really cool, letting you customize it to a very fine degree. Also, you can chnage your ships, and the environment's colours any time you want. That had to be mentioned.\nThe flaws are few, and given this game's early-access status, still potentially resolvable. First, the lone map, though generates the locations of bases and "cities" with every load, can get repetitive rather quickly. More maps, or a larger map, would go a long way to making this game last much, much longer. Secondly, having more missions, goals, tasks and objectives in between the awsome combat could help elongate the experience too. Misisons do exist, yes, but they are few and far between, and I had trouble finding them.\n\nTo recap:\nThe game has an exccelent visual style, excellent combat and progressions, decent sound design and insane levels of customization.\nHowever, the lone map and few objectives make the game feel a tad empty, though both could be fixed over time with little problems.\nOverall, This game is awsome, and deserves way more attention than it's getting.\n\nEDIT: The map scenario isn't too bad when you consider the arena challenges, after playing some more.","January 18, 2015","true","17.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

I could have read the help menu in the interface but decided to wing it. I picked my ship from a choice of 3 and off I went, flying around in a station and getting my butt kicked. To be honest, I found it fun... it gave me a feeling that I hadn't felt since the NES when I played games such as Metroid and Solar Jetman which I didn't have the manuals for: exploration. Not only of a level or map, but of the game itself. It didn't take me too long to figure out what the game was about.\n\nYou are in some kind of computer system which is represented by a space station with corridors and rooms. In this space station there are 4 different factions. You have the good guys which are the operating system and anti-virus, and the bad guys which are virus and malware. Each factions files or programs are represented by ships. Some carry harmful malware around while others attack programs of the opposing factions. You are caught in the middle of this war but luckily are aligned with the OS/Antivirus to begin with.\n\nThe idea of the game is simple: fly around in your ship and kill stuff, pick up their debris which will allow you to research and eventually use the modules and hulls that they are using. Acting on this idea, at least to begin with, is difficult, as you are going to get killed by ships which are higher level than you. A lot. I didn't mind this though... I quickly understood that attacking anything that was more than a level above me would end badly, so I searched for lower level enemies. After getting my ♥♥♥ kicked for a little while, running away from higher level programs that were gunning for me, I found myself being able to fend for myself a bit more. After a while longer, I felt like I could at least give as good as I got, and a little while longer, I was king of that space station and any Virus or Malware stupid enough to cross my path was in deep trouble and I was ready to go to the next tier of space station. That's the thing: there is a massive snowball effect in this game with regards to levelling. After the initial teething problem at the beginning of any tier, you are going to be outgunned for a while, but once you begin to claw your way up, you will be dominating in no time. It's oh so addictive and a lot of fun, if a little repetitive: something which is not really too big a deal for me, I don't mind grinding.\n\nIt's a great game but if I had any complaints, it would be that every station feels the same. It's the same central hub with the same corridors and same bases; it would be nice to see some variations in layout - it also seems to me that every time you log into the game, the bases will have switched positions randomly around the map. Not a huge problem but just a bit unnecessary. I'd also like the ability to assault enemy bases and defend my allies' bases. Sure you can take over the central hub but that doesn't really do anything apart from net you some rewards. It's quite obvious to me that this game is perfect for some kind of territorial conquest side to it, but no matter, maybe someday we will see a mod or dlc for that.\n\nIn summary, if you like space simulator type games, grinding for new and shiny loot to help you find even newer shinier loot, you will love this game. I do expect that most people would get bored of the repetition before they reach the last space station though, but at least you'll get your money's worth first.","February 25","true","18.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Played some other games beforeturning to this on a break. after about a 15 minute learning curve, I was hooked. I recommend playing with the controls to find something you're comfortable with. The default controls might work for someone, but not me. Don't get frustrated early on if you're not used to this type of game. Stick it out, it's worth it. The visuals are sweet, the music is good. Progress is in small increments that make it really feel like even if you're just messing around you're making progress. In short, a really good game, worth the risk.","May 2","true","61.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

To make the transition smoother to a 3D, zero-G, FPS environment, you can slow down the gameplay and increase "autobraking" so the vehicle is more manageable. Gameplay is straightforward, shoot the other guy. Plenty of map to explore, ton of upgrades as you keep killing the red guys. Graphics are nicely done, has a Tron-esque feel to it all, and at least running on Nvidia GTX 660 (Linux), getting steady 60FPS with smooth rendering, so should run on low-end boxes well enough. The dev is/was pretty active on Reddit, so nice to see hands-on development on an early release game. Well worth your $20.","February 23","true","8.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It offers an open world, intense fast paced FPS action in 6DoF (that i never knew existed or that I wanted), intense customability, and endless-seeming content.

However, being afraid of Early Access, I just put this game on my followlist & wishlist. Now that the game is out of Early Access, all I can say is, it was worth the wait.\n\nHow can I define the game though... 6DOF Twitch Shooter? With ARPG-like progression (grind) system? With randomization to a certain degree? I don't know how to put it exactly. You gather data, discover new parts, new hulls, new weapons, etc... customize your ship, and keep fighting. I know this isn't much to say about this game though...\n\nOne thing that this game does differently is, allowing you to customize your own difficulty. Enemies dealing too much damage? Lower their damage, at the cost of loot though. Game is too fast for you? Lower the game speed. AI is too dumb? Increase their... processing power?\n\nGraphics are minimalistic, but I think it serves the game well. One thing you can do is, you can change the theme of the level. Audio and music are OK, but the combat music gets repetetive very fast.\n\nThe game does nearly no hand-holding, so prepare to spend a good 5-10 minutes in the "HELP" section, which covers most of the important stuff in the game really well. If you have a question, don't hesitate to ask it on the forums as the developer of the game is very, VERY active on the forums, trying to help people out as much as he can.\n\nDon't expect a fully randomized gameplay though. Or in other words, full procedural generation, or whatever it is called these days. All station layouts are the same, there are 5 (?) wings, 4 factions, and the station core itself. What's randomized is, the enemy / ally ship layouts, bases, base owners, etc... imagine the layour as the canvas, and it's a different painting each time you play the game, but it'll always be the same canvas, don't know how else I can explain it.\n\nOverall, a great game, and I really suggest it to people who like 6DOF or Twitch Shooters especially. Also, if you are still reading, but are confused (probably you are as I tend to jump from topic to topic without summing the first topic up), here is a video review about 1.0 (by Tim Leftwich & Pat Rodriguez)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzrHK0xbts0","February 24","true","29.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

This is but a brief summary of the full review, for the full review you can find it here: http://www.universalgamingreviews.com/neonxsz-review-and-overview/\n\nNeonXSZ is a 6DOF game that takes place in a computer styled game that feels like Tron and Descent had a baby. The game is incredibly well designed and features over 900 total upgrades for you to discover and unlock. It's mechanics work incredibly well together and none of them feel underdeveloped or weak compared to others. It's a fine piece of craftsmanship that is well worth checking out, especially if you enjoy the 6DOF genre.\n\nI've also recorded an updated gameplay video for the game:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktt69lIDNq8\n\nThanks for reading folks and happy gaming!\n\n-Shaun Meyers (Kyo Akiara) out!","March 4","true","8.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Instead of shooting things, collecting loot and leveling up, I now have to shoot several finicky, akwardly placed switchs, race through an extremely disorienting maze in 3d space and run into a door that just slammed in my face.  I don't find this mechanic fun at all.  It is extremely frustrating and boaring.  I had to change my rating to not recommended.  I've been working on one of these stupid things for two hours now.
