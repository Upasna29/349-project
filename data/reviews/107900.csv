The company has no customer support, no working forum or updated social media, yet they will still process your credit card.  They do not police hackers, which the game is rife with.  I encourage everyone to report this product as fraudulent and get it off Steam.  It is a black-mark against the platform, and should not be represented.","November 10, 2014","false","25.5"," 2,340 of 2,417 people (97%) found this review helpful 90 people found this review funny","97","340","2","90","30"

Until hackers took over. And it became Pay 2 Win. Seriously, back before i even got on steam this game had me loving the everliving s**t out of it. THEN it tanked. Crappy servers, as in no one online when i logged in, multiple times. And it was thoroughly unsatisfying with the whole pay2win scenario. I wouldn't recommend playing this game anymore, unless you have a time machine so you can go back to 2012 and play it when it was actually relevant.\n\nSo sorry for all you who downloaded this game at this point.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dacynder/recommended/107900/","dacynder","Despina Vadamus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dacynder/","159 products in account","This is a game that I thought would be great until I discovered it was created by the same people that made Infestation, which was War Z before the name change. This is completely a 100% pay to play AND pay to win game as you cannot buy any kind of weapon or gear nor open boxes without paying real money for the game. There are crates you can open with GP but the reward is so miniscule that it isn't even worth it. After playing this game you can have a complete idea of how horrendous and terrible Infestation is, or if you played Infestation and then played this then you can see why they made Infestation so horrible.\n\nAnimations are mediocre, textures are very bland, models of characters makes Half Life 2 look like a masterpiece for graphics (don't get me wrong btw, HL2 is an amazing game but their graphics are back in the 2000s), and overall this game is broken since there is no such thing as an anti-hack. Oh, I forgot to mention this game is also infested with hackers and the player base is under 50 making Call of Duty Ghosts look like a popular game (which I still believe is a horrendous game in its state).\n\nThe only positive thing I can even remotely say about this game is the fact that you have the option before you spawn each time whether you want to play 1st person or 3rd person.\n\nGraphics: 4/10\nSounds: 3/10\nAnimation: 3/10\nGameplay: 1/10\n\nOverall: 2.75/10\n\nAvoid this game at all costs unless you have money to spare and want a game that is just as bland and boring as Infestation.","October 28, 2014","false","16.5"," 470 of 514 people (91%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","91","470","514","23","0"

I met Steam with a warm greeting and it began to peddle its wares as is customary.\n\n"Just for you," said Steam, "this one is free." Steam then slowly dangled "War Inc. Battlezone" to and fro uncomfortably close to my face. At first, I was too disoriented by the nauseating smell of "pay to win" to clearly see the title of the game.\n\n"Wait a minute," I exclaimed as the title finally came into focus, "isn't that the free to play shooter I tried out maybe three years ago, hated, uninstalled, and then promptly pushed to the back of my mind?"\n\n"Look, you've been labeling a lot of games as 'Not Interested' lately. I'm obligated to recommend something" Steam replied while scratching its neck and twitching, obviously somewhat agitated.\n\n"I can understand that, but this is a game I previously played. I even wrote a negative review for it. Speaking of which, where is that negative review I wrote for it? Did I delete it for some reason and forget about it?" I questioned.\n\nSteam looked at me directly, a look that could only be described as feral "That's really not important, just download it. It's free, man. You just go ahead and get the download going, just kick back and wait for it to install... get in the downloading mood... maybe buy a game or two after that..."\n\nSteam's words began to fade out as its feral demeanor calmed and seemed to give way to classic opium nodding. Soon enough, Steam was unconscious. I fetched a pillow and blanket and decided to let Steam sleep it off. In the meantime, I decided to leave a new negative review here since I really didn't know where my old one went. Perhaps at one point in time I had been as impaired as Steam had been today and deleted it without remembering. It was so long ago that I made that first review for this game; I do not fully recall its content. Maybe some things are best lost to time.","June 23, 2015","false","0.5"," 633 of 712 people (89%) found this review helpful 791 people found this review funny","89","633","712","791","16"

Cut off the top half inch of the garlic bulb to expose ends of individual cloves. Leaving garlic bulb whole, remove any loose, papery outer layers. Place bulb, cut end up, on a double thickness of foil. Drizzle with the oil. Bring foil up around bulb and fold edges together to loosely enclose.

When garlic head is cool enough to handle, squeeze garlic paste out of the individual cloves.\nIn a food processor combine roasted pepper quarters and the garlic paste. Cover and pulse until combined, but still slightly chunky.\nIn a large bowl, combine tomatoes and serrano pepper. Add roasted pepper and garlic combination and stir to combine. Add diced avocado, lime zest, lime juice, and salt.

It was at a time where I was a bit burnt out on BC2, and decided to give this a try since it did have Third Person over the shoulder type playstyle. Having said that, I did play it for quite a bit, and I will say it was entertaining enough, but by no means a good game. Not surprised this game is dead as it seems the devs and whoever supported it moved on to the Abomination that is Infestation: Survivor Stories aka The War-Z.

Let me start off by saying it seems good. It's quite unique in the sense you can play in both first-person and third-person. Due to preference. Now that's a good feature. As well as there being some quite interesting weapons too. All seeming quite unique. But the cons in this case, definately out-weigh the pros.\n\nOkay, so the sound in this game, is awful. I don't mean the gunfire (though sometimes even if there are different weapons some sound the same) but the territory which you tread on. It feels so un-finished and like it's in some kind of testing stage. I thought this game would be good it seemed decent but no. This game is just completely ♥♥♥♥. You just go onto servers and there are either veterans, or noobs. And there are only ever about 2 servers active on exactly the same maps. And the sound like I said, can also be extremely misleading. For example, you don't even make some sort of splashing sound when going through water, and if you previously walked on some kind of metallic surface and then continued to walk onto a path which is dirt or grass, you hear the same sound until the game finally decides to correct itself.\n\nThe game modes and maps however, this game lacks them A LOT. It's been out for a good I believe, 2-3 years (I may be wrong) and still has an extremely limited variety. The starter weapons for each class are quite weighed out, but it just feels really pay-2-win. I'm not saying that it is, but it seems that the weapons overall are just un-balanced when you take a look at the stats. As well as the armour. You can do without all of those though, but it's still really stupid.\n\nIf I were you, I'd keep away from this buggy mess of a game. Oh also there are extremely misleading holes in some walls, that you can not shoot through. The terrain in the game is also just awful. The game presents itself to be somewhat high-quality though it is certainly the opposite.\n\nI'd advise everyone to keep as far away from this terrible game as possible. It's not worth your time, nor is it worth the 3-4 hour download +1 additional hour to install updates within the launcher itself.\n\nIf you disagree then please feel free to comment below or if I missed anything else awful about this game in particular despite that I have made this a fairly brief review. Thanks for reading and I hope I helped you out in some sort of way.","April 29, 2014","false","2.7"," 103 of 122 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","103","122","0","5"

Now the game revolves around pay2win tactics and hacking. Not to mention the non-existant recoil, its basically just point, shoot, get a kill. Also, whats with this first person/third person ♥♥♥♥? Third person allows you to watch around corners and look over wall/windows, where as first person is, well, first person. So techincally, the game gives you an option to play infairly, minus the pay2in aspect.\n\nIt seems to me that the developers did what they did with WarZ, the game got popular, got them some serious cash with minimal effort, and they ran out with everyones money, except with this, there will always be some rich little ♥♥♥♥, hacking until he cries of laughter and buys just about the entire store. This game makes Call of Duty look like a Bethesda or Blizzard title, and thats saying something.\n\nIf you are one of the few people who played this in its glory days(closed beta-open beta end), then props to you, because you're probably level 60 like me and now you can just let the fact that all that time you spent on this game has gone to waste.","December 22, 2013","false","0.2"," 116 of 145 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","116","145","0","0"

War Inc. Battlezone was probably one of the worst.\n\nWhile it may not be the worst of them all, it's down near the bottom. The main question is why?\n\nHaving a third person element to shooters has never worked out very well. You either have to set the FOV (field of view) to some console like snake around your neck, or deal with the fact that people can look around a wall. This doesn't allow for fair play.\n\nPhysics are not good, ragdoll simulations are some of the worst.\n\nThe game isn't all that bad however, it's a new spin on millitary FPSes.

Graphics are very dated (though not as bad as Combat Arms), and the sounds are just terrible. It is both low quality and footsteps sound exactly the same whether running, walking, or crouched. Other players sounds is not reliable in any way shape or form. Enemies can be right in front of you and you will not hear their rifle fire, but they'll be across the map and their weapons will sound like they are right next to you. Same with footsteps.\n\nThe map I did play was big, and textures were very bad. Players may have been very new to shooters, so that might be why they were really bad. Seems to be very little player activity on east coast servers, no west coast servers available.\n\nMy comment on the skill tree system, I chose medic, and until I unlock skills you start off as a standard normal fps shooter. Not a problem. What bewildered me was the lack of explanation on certain skills that i could choose to spend my skill points on, and what really threw me off is, as a medic, you would believe you heal teammates. But the medkit (skill to heal your teammates) cost 5 points, which was more than all of the other skills available to me. Just really didn't make any sense. I could grind out 5 skill points pretty easily from what it seems through leveling up, but that just really shows that your medics main job really isn't to be a medic. Anyways, bad game, feels like a new game but apparently this has been around for some time.","November 6, 2014","false","1.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Later on, it gets annoying. You'll see only a handful of populous servers, but those are primarily occupied by those who spend countless hours on the game in addition to tons of real money. Auto Team Balance is garbage. I just tried the game again because they were giving everyone free game money; the money you use to buy stuff you can't keep unless you want to use real money. Our team was starting to break through and take a lead during Conquest, even though we were short by two players. Auto Team Balance should've fixed that, but it wasn't until the other team started capturing more to the point where we had to scramble to defend our one and only capture that Team Balance decided to give us a player. People raged as it happened so we ended up short one player anyway. We lost.

Now, this game was a serious gem. It really required skill, tactics, and understanding of the maps and weapons you were dealing with. It wasn't like Call of Duty, where your guns kick like babies and as long as you keep your reflex sight on something you hit it, it had insane recoil, lots of spread, large variations in damage. All the guns were very diverse; none were the same, and excluding a few, they were all very balanced. The map design for the most part was amazing and well thought out. But no one gave this game credit for what it was, which in my opinion was probably one of the best multiplayer exclusive games ever created, just because of small issues like bad starting weapons, a pay to win system, and a few hackers. Eventually, because EA handed the game to a smaller company that co-owned it (EAsy), the community eventually started dying out and the game was shut down even after various offers to purchase it from players and other companies.\n\nThis game really does remind me of Battlefield Play4Free. I think it's incredibly fun, and the weapon balance, despite starting with mediocre weapons, is excellent. There are no two guns alike with one better in some way (like BF3, where the M16A3 trumps all) and all of them feel slightly different and behave differently. The map design feels relatively nice and there aren't any of those stupid maps where the center is a chokepoint/slaughterfest for either team. So far I haven't found but a few glitches and none of them have to do with abusing maps; mostly just audio and graphics glitches (i.e. fire a rifle and unscope and it doesn't go through the bolting animation). Please, I just ask of you, that if you happen to come across this review, seriously try the game, even if you don't spend much time on it. This community is slowly dying as well, and I don't want another amazing game to slip between our fingers.\n\nOverall Pros:\nVery good weapon balance\nFun, balanced maps\nGreat gameplay\nWeapons CAN be bought permanently WITHOUT spending any real money (Daily rewards, WP, crates)\nNice map and weapon diversity\nGreat customization system\n\nOverall Cons:\nSome hackers\nEnough WP to buy guns is harder to get than it should be\nClunky gameplay (but still fun)\nOccasional glitches\nSomewhat confusing user interface\n\nOverall, I think it's a great game. Please don't overlook it.","September 21, 2015","true","13.4"," 25 of 46 people (54%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","54","25","46","9","0"

Haven't played the mod? Well, I will say that this game is grape. Yep, grape.\n\nYou start off randomly spawned in the area of Chanarus, most likely near the coasts. You are equipped with clothes, a battery, and a flashlight. Shortly afterwards you are hungry and thirsty.\n\nYour main objective is to find buildings and search for food and drink and then a melee weapon. Don't know where you are at? Find a online map of Chanarus and look for town signs and landmarks. Once you've found where you are at, make your way to the nearest town for supplies. Keep in mind your current clothes allow for very little inventory, so you'll want to look for new clothes in order to carry more items.\n\nOK, so you've managed to find a can of soda, a can of tuna, and some gloves. Good start. Now you'll want to continue... wait. Is that a zombie you hear? Yep. He sees you. Go back inside that house and shut the door. Everyone knows they don't know how to use doors because THEY CAN CLIP THROUGH THE FREAKING WALLS!!! AHHHHHH!!!\n\nAlright, after you've put down the zombie with a hammer, you'll want to take care of the warm red stuff squirting out from your body. Take off your shirt and rip it into rags. Now use the rags as bandages. Good as new. Carefully move on to the... What? Hungry again? But you just ate 3 minutes ago. Pull out the can of beans you found and... crap. You need something sharp to open the can. Keep looking. Maybe the guy rapidly coming at you screaming "HEY YOU! I WANT TO AXE YOU A FEW QUESTIONS!" can be of some assistance. Calmly face him and...\n\nYou start off randomly spawned in the area of Chanarus, most likely near the coasts. You are equipped with clothes, a battery, and a flashlight. Shortly afterwards you are hungry and thirsty. Is that some fruit on the ground? Oh lucky day! Pick up the fruit, dust off the mold, and take a bite. Feeling a little sick? It's probably nothing. Just keep moving...\n\nYou start off randomly spawned in the area of Chanarus, most likely near the coasts. You are equipped with clothes, a battery, and a flashlight.

You are equipped with clothes, a battery, and a flashlight. Shortly afterwards you are hungry and thirsty. You look up to find another newly spawned user who is disoriented but has a cool hat. You look down and find an axe. Now you have a cool hat and two sets of clothes, batteries, and flashlights...\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n\nUpdate as of May 15, 2014.\n\nThank you to all of you who have commented and voted on my review so far. I have noticed a few similar questions and comments being repeatedly posted, so I am going to address some here.\n\n1. Does this game require ArmA II?\n\nNo, it is a standalone game, which is different than the mod, that requires no other purchases. When you buy the game, you can start playing immediately and after the full release.\n\n2. This game sucks.\n\nYou're certainly allowed to have your own opinion, but I happen to like it. Keep in mind that the game is not even in Beta, and there is a warning given before purchasing the game. It is recommended you wait for the game to be released or try the mod or even Rust. The mod is fun but I haven't tried Rust yet, so I cannot comment.\n\n3. Your review sucks.\n\nAgain, you are allow your opinion. This was mainly meant as a joke. I understand that some people will not get it. Thankfully we live in the age of the internet where you can easily and quickly find other reviews that may be more helpful.\n\n4. You've only played for x hours.\n\nI have 40+ other games I like to play plus other time constraints. Why do I have to always play DayZ? I like to play for a few hours here and there to see what updates have been applied to the game, and I will keep doing so until Beta or release. That is not an admission that the game sucks, it's just not finished yet and I like to switch things up.\n\n5. Will you be my Steam friend?\n\nI am flattered you would ask me but I respectfully decline. My Steam friends list is already out of control and adding more will not help me. Besides, the chances of you ever playing a game with me would be very slim. Thank you for understanding.\n","May 19, 2014","true","4.6"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","50","10","20","6","9"

With the horrible 2D muzzle flash and crappy graphics, this game features very few redeeming features. While it was kind of fun playing it, you quickly ran out of ammo and had to resort to the abysmally underpowered pistols and SMGs. The shotguns weren't bad, and probably the most fun bit of the game - and the most satisfying - but they literally lacked sights. Instead you are given a circle very similar to a hipfire reticule. I played about 20 mins of this game and got bored.

The game often becomes a pay-to-win game, unless you happen to have an equally powerful weapon. But of course, this trend has been recurring in majority of the free-to-play games on the market.

The game has very minimalistic pay to win. There are some guns you can only get by paying real money. However, every time you level up it gives you a certain weapon for a few days, some of them being payed weapons. Some levels let you try out everything in the store for a few days. The weapons you buy with money don't even have that much of an advantage over those that don't. For example, You can buy a barrett with money, compared to the best "bolt action"(will discuss later) it has slightly higher damage and firerate, and less accuracy. The obvious bolt action snipers(typically the ones with the larger max ranges) don't exactly bolt. They have a roughly 1 second time inbetween each shot(typically bolts in fps take 1.5-2), and it takes 1-2 shots from any bolt action to kill.\n\nThe buisness model is a little bit dissapointing, as you rent things out. For items such as grenades, abilities, Uav, etc. It takes roughly 1 decent game to buy it for a day, and maybe 2 or 3 games to buy it for a week. You cannot perm tacticals without the premium currency(basically you can't earn it without paying)\nWeapons are a bit different. Those you can buy with the soft currency typically can only be bought for 30 days or perm. Thirty days are... I'd say maybe 40 games depending on the weapon. Permanant is usually 10x more. Obviously I haven't gotten enough currency to perm a weapon, so I can't see if it has one of those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ repair features.\n\nGameplay is pretty well done. There are 4 classes. Assault, sniper, medic, engineer. You unlock your class skills by leveling up, and putting skill points(1 per level) into a skill tree. Once you put enough skill points into the first row of upgrades, the second row will become available, and once you put enough into that, the last one will be available. I only have experience with the medic, who has 2 useful teamplay skills(He has others, I just chose not to purchase them) which is putting down a medkit which yourself and teamamtes get health over time from standing near. His other skill increases the range of one of the tactical abilities, which is regen teamates that are close to you.\n\nIt does have a decently slow TTK, you may put 10 bullets from an SMG to kill someone. It is satisfying to get a kill. You have very limited ammo, and with the slow time to kill, you could find yourself running out quickly. There is the option to go to an ammo crate on the map, but to refill you have to buy a key that costs real money.\n\n\nI know I've said a lot of bad about the game, but it really is fair. Definitely one of the better fps games IMO. It is a pretty good looker, and making the graphic setting minimal and using a game booster, I get 30 frames on my ♥♥♥♥ laptop\n(   Intel  Atom CPU Z3735F @ 1.33GHz  1.33 GHz  ) and it still looks decent.","August 11, 2015","true","18.0"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

However the game itself is very simple. If you liked shooters, this is for you. Don't cost nothing and not much space to take up on can even play on laptop.

Not all games even if they have better weapons are pay to win.  Alot of games like this need the income to keep the servers running, as for graphics well.  ITS A FREE TO PLAY GAME!!!!!!!  Of course the games aren't gonna have the best of graphics I mean this game is older but I used to play it and really enjoy it.  I also loved combat arms, soldier front 2 and a few others.  Saying this game's graphics are bad are like saying half life 2 was a ♥♥♥♥ game.  Doesn't make sense.  In fact for someone like me this is a really good game I do not own a great or even ok computer.  My video holds me back heavily so these older titles that keep running mean a lot to me cause it lets me play still.  And do not come and give me a reply saying, oh but look at planetside 2 its free to play.....That game doesn't count mainly because it was made by a multi million dollar company, sony.  So in the end for me I give this game for what is a 7/10 not the greatest but trust me if you look past a few things which you have to do in free to play multiplayer fps's its not a bad game.","August 2, 2015","true","8.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I love this game. I don't play it often because of my other addictions. But when you get gewd, you will play it 24/7. This game is like Battlefield. Atleast thats the vibe I get. Everything feels realistic, almost as if you were there. The gameplay is smooth and the guns selections and unlocks are fantastic. As far as I know there aren't any overpowered weapons that will make you quit. Which is fantastic. I reccomend this to anyone who likes realistic shooters.","March 7, 2015","true","11.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Official_KwS/recommended/107900/","Official_KwS","KidwithSmurf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Official_KwS/","827 products in account","For an FPS that sadly hasn't updated since 2012 this seems nifty and fun. I'd say cs:go even took features from this game to add to theirs.\n\nAlthough it hasn't been updated since 2012, I stilled managed to get a game instantly in November 2014 and had many postivies\n\nPositives:\n♦ Matches a short\n♦ Matches are fun\n♦ Good Voice over when playing Capture the Zone to tell you when an enemy has caputred/started capturing a zone\n♦ Good idea to get crates from killing people which can be unlocked for a small price to get premium weapons\n♦ Definitely didn't seem pay to win\n♦ Epic level system and skill system\n♦ Balanced (I hadn't played since 2012 and I was getting first place... go figure)\n♦ Has ingame currency and premium currency\n♦ Free to Play\n♦ Fun\n♦ Lots of Achievements\n♦ Definitely no hackers from what I saw\n♦ Epic number of weapons and loadouts\n\nThe only negatives I saw are:\n\nNegatives:\n♦ No updates since 2012\n♦ Premium Weapons Expire\n♦ Not able to trade Premium Weapons and items on Steam like in cs:go\n\n\nOverall, in my opinion, the game is a really fun FPS concidering it was made in 2011 with no updates in 2012. Things are payable to get but don't need to be and don't give you an advantage over others who didn't pay for items. Really well built, love the level system and the ingame voice overs/crate idea. One of the best FPS's for todays times that I'd highly recommend.\n\nOverall, I'd rate this 3/5!\n\nPS: It'd be a 5/5 if it was still updated. Though it's still active and I didn't see any hackers. I got a game instantly as of November 2014 and I got First Place on my team and I hadn't played since 2012. Also, I have killed 96 players 10 levels higher than me... so before you say this review is biased or I haven't played enough... go figure.","November 8, 2014","true","5.6"," 10 of 24 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","10","24","0","0"

Whoever preorders WarZ is quite similar to taking a ♥♥♥♥ on your wallet, lighting it on fire, and then flushing the charred remains down your toilet.\n\nThat is all.","October 4, 2012","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'd like to say the weapon sounds are almost 100% taken from unity engine. Also the guns are ♥♥♥♥. Snipers do about 1-3 hits to kill someone, a normal secondary (ex; smg) will kill you in 0.5 seconds. The download in the client took about 20 minutes.

There is no balancing in this game, no teamwork, and worst of all, so much pay to win. I was literally playing for a first time test and was greeted with a M249 killing everyone, while the guy using it was just letting his gun do all the work. End of the game, everyone had at least 5 kills while this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ had 26 kills and 6 deaths. How is this pay 2 win you ask? I can't confirm it was, but the point of that was how terrible their balancing system was. How OP was this? Here's how: My entire team got obliterated by this one guy.

Was surprisingly slightly better than I expected. People said there would be hackers and pay-to-win players, but really, it's just low-level players with the same unlocked gear as you.\n\nThat said, the last time this game was updated was about 18 months ago, but it will still process your credit card. Lag and desync issues ruin combat, because enemies tank shots and instakill you. Game doesn't look too bad but sound effects are monotonous and bugged.\n\nGames aren't too long (8-15 minutes), but you'll either end up carrying your team because they're all stupid or losing horribly. Spawn camping happens frequently.\n\nHonestly I'd probably give this game a 4/10. Good practice for I:SS PVP if you'd like to use it as such. Would not recommed for having fun with, though.","February 28, 2015","false","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The objectives also aren't clear; I often have teamates running around trying to figure out what they're supposed to be doing. The game has very large maps aswell. There aren't nearly enough players for the maps, making us search forever just to shoot or be shot. Really, all I'm trying to say is that I generally hate this game.","April 25, 2015","false","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Die mit Echtgeld gekauften Waffen und Panzerungen hat man ganz klar Vorteile gegen über den anderen. Jedoch kann man auch ohne etwas zu bezahlen mithalten. Die Anfangswaffe, die M16, ist nicht zu unterschätzen! Jedoch ist sie jetzt auch nicht das Gelbe vom Ei. Ich finde es ein bischen schade, dass man wenige Waffen für Ingame Geld kaufen kann, und die die man kaufen kann sich mega teuer, so dass es eine Zeit dauern wird bis man das Geld zusammen hat. Der größte Minuspunkt sind die Hacker. Aber naja...Hammerpoint...Mehr muss man nicht sagen.\nFazit: Es ist ein netter F2P Shooter in dem leider recht viel gehackt wird und das Spielen so unmöglich macht. Wenn man mal ohne Hacker ist macht es doch recht viel Spaß, auch ohne etwas zu bezahlen.\n\nTipp: Spielt in der Third-Person- Perspektive. Das bringt euch einen imensen Vorteil!","July 24, 2013","true","44.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
