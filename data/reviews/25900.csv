For an extensive review of the entire series, my blog: http://waltermstewart.wordpress.com/2013/01/15/kings-bounty-series-review, for a condense review of this game, read on.\n\nThis is the first entry in the series and it is well worth the current listing price, but it frequently goes on sale (at least 3 times a year if I recall, also available in a bundle pack if I'm not mistaken).  This game is an adventure/exploration game in a generic fantasy world following all the common tropes.  The primary difference between this game's lore and the world you are already familiar with is the sense of humor the writers have.  If you take the time to read the text (no voice overs), you will be rewarded with the occasional typo (originally from Russian), but more frequently a wonderful lore based joke, parodying modern fantasy lore.\n\nThe battles and strategy within are quite fun, and the game progresses reasonably, but it doesn't ruin the experience and shouldn't prevent you from playing this game.\n\nIf you like RPGs, quest driven games, turn based or grid based strategies, I highly recommend this game.","November 25, 2013","true","123.1"," 50 of 56 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","50","56","0","1"

I now regret not having discovered this treasure earlier. While only a handful of hours into the game, thus far it has already surpassed all expectations and the regard I had for HOMM 1-6 and Disciples 3. If you liked any of of the HOMM iterations or Disciples, you will appreciate King's Bounty: The Legend. My only regret is in buying the game standalone instead of a bundle which I'll now buy as still a better bargain than grabbing the expansions singularly.\n\nEnjoy Friends :)\n\nEDIT: To give a bit mroe detail the game, I come to King's Bounty with serious HOMM experiece and a bit of Discpiples. IMO, the HOMM and Disciples are grreat series' but they all fall down at the point of eventually aving spent hours upon hours to build huge armies only to find the AI has outdone you. King's Bounty so far has enough in the smaller side quests to be rewarding enough to give the above review while avoiding "Enemy Heroes" while I build up my Mage in readiness to take over the world ;]\n\nIn summary, If you haven't played the series before but enjoy the "HOMMi=-like" subgenre as I saw it, you will love this game.","October 18, 2014","true","196.2"," 38 of 43 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","38","43","0","1"

The battle system is reminiscent of Heroes of Might and Magic, but King's Bounty is not a strategy game, like Heroes. Instead, you explore the (huge) game world at your own pace, without having to worry about some opponent getting stronger if you take your time.\n\nYou explore the maps (in real time) to gather resources and troops, then defeat monsters that are roaming the map, or guarding some chest... or even just waiting for you to try to kill them. The game doesn't have many mandatory battles, each enemy you defeat gives you experience, so you need to kill them to get enough XP to level up your hero.  When you get close to some enemy, the game changes to a hexagonal grid, and places your troops vs the enemy troops in a turn-based strategic combat. There's LOTS of strategy involved here, BTW. You can't just move your troops casually in the battlefield, this WILL get you killed quite fast! Instead, you have to think before moving each troop, even ONE badly placed unit can mean your defeat.\n\nJust like the first 3 Heroes games, you don't use your hero directly in battles. Instead, you control your troops, but can use magics and skills of your hero once per turn. The hero is VERY important, since a well placed magic can turn the tide of a battle in your favor.\n\nThe game is very extensive. The map is huge, there are LOTS of optional battles, a big variety of troops for you to acquire, a robust skill tree for your hero (that includes some passive skills to make your troops better), a simple marriage system and tons of side-quests scattered around. The game is HUGE. While you can beat it in 50 or so hours, you can play it for 100 hours and still have something to do and some enemy to kill. Not only that, but the game has a random placement of enemies, and 3 different heroes to choose, so there's a nice replay value.\n\nLastly, the technical aspects aren't bad. The graphics are beautiful (with a big variety of textures in most environments), your units are very detailed and the game has some very good looking special effects (spells, detailed shadows, bloom). The sounds are very good too, and each unit has its own grunts and taunts. Also, the game has some AMAZING musics by Lind Erebros. Each map has its own playlist of songs, and they usually mix well with the environments of the map you are in.\n\n\nAnyway, King's Bounty is amazing. It has some minor flaws, like a cruel difficulty spike and lots of backtracking (specially to replenish troops), its not a friendly game towards newbies (good troop units aren't finite, you can't reset your skill trees allocation without restarting the game, etc). Also, the story is very forgettable, and the dialogs are usually very stupid. But the flaws don't hurt the game. Its a huge game, with LOTS of things to do and huge maps to explore. Its also slow paced, so you don't have to rush, like in the Heroes series.\n\nI QUITE recommend this game. Just don't expect to have a casual stroll in here. ^^","June 21, 2015","true","107.3"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","19","22","0","0"

Developers have put their soul into making the new King's Bounty as oldschool as it gets. Except for graphics -- it's 2015 now, and it still looks really great.\n\nAs of the gameplay itself, imagine "Heroes of Might & Magic" meet "Space Rangers" (another living classics, by the way): you have something like an open fantasy world to explore (few huge locations, actually, but it's close enough), where you can hire creatures of every kind, find loot (artifacts, gold, XP), complete quests of various kinds. Hell, you can even marry here (your wife will give you children, which would provide bonuses to your skills -- sick stuff, right?).\n\nThe battles look like Heroes -- classical TBS faceoff: you're placing your units on one side, your opponent stands on the other. You both can cast spells, and you can even summon guardians (think Final Fantasy) to damage your opponent or buff your own troops.\n\nThe storyline is excellent -- it ha everything: irony, mystery, sideline quests, and even multiple quests choices.\n\nThis is the first game of it's franchise, so if you're wondering about trying a new oldschool strategy -- it's a must that you'll buy this game.\n\nI'd rate it 9.0 out of 10.0.","January 26, 2015","true","62.3"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

I must say, despite being very sceptical of the series, up to this point, I am very pleased with King's Bounty, especially when I got all the games, except the newly released title King's Bounty: Dark Side, for 75% off. If you like the Heroes of Might and Magic series, then you will surely like these games as well.\n\nVery similar in style and gameplay. As it turns out, the King's Bounty series actually came before the Heroes games, dating all the way back the days of the NES console. Heroes of Might and Magic has actually been directly inspired by King's Bounty, and this can been seen all across the board in King's Bounty.\n\nAs mentioned, the gameplay is almost similar to Heroes, with the exception of base building and maintenance.\n\nYou create a hero, selected from three classes and then you complete quests (side and main), leveling up in a classic RPG fashion.

This is a turn based strategy game set in a colorful and atmospheric fantasy world with a very nice and energetic soundtrack.  It kinda works like JRPGs, there are monsters/enemies wandering the map and if you attack them or get near, you enter a battle screen.  On one side of the battlefield is your army which is composed of up to 5 different unit type of your choice (you find different unit types throughout the whole game) and the other side is the enemy.  You each take turns commanding a specific unit and issue a specific command, you can also use a magic from your spellbook or inventory to help turn the tide towards your favor.\n\nIt's a pretty decent Turn based RTS game but I can't run this game on my mac anymore because this game doesn't like mac for some reason and developers don't seem to give a damn.

The exploration mode is a point and click venture, while the battle sequences are a hex-based turn based strategy affair.\n\nThe levelling up system works very well, but you only level yourself up, not your units. The only way of acquiring new units (including replacing lost units) is to buy them again and while this works, you begin to learn that you only have a finite number of units (other than swordsman and archers), which, after losing multiple higher level units which are irreplacable, came as somewhat of a disappointment. Also, replacing units can become slightly tedious.\n\nHowever, with that said I am thoroughly enjoying the game as a whole and I am looking forward to playing the other three in the series. The graphics are very good, the music is enjoyable and the game is challenging.\n\nRecommended.","August 23, 2014","true","27.0"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

The key difference? King's Bounty is a single player game. The Map screen is not turn-based, but real time; You're not managing any army of heroes and castles, just the one hero. But in exchange you get richer character development, as well as stories and quests; More of an RPG experience.\n\nPresentation; The Tutorial is adequate, and there's more story then you're probably expecting. The UI is not quite as good as I remember from HoMM games, but quite playable.\n\nGameplay; The Combat is basically the same as from HoMM; But the Map screen being simpler and less managerial means you can focus more on the combat. And if you find yourself in over your head, you can always fall back and rebuild your army, without it costing you turns that the enemy will grow in strength during.\n\nVisuals; The graphics quality is more than adequate, and the aesthetic, while not quite as stylized as HoMM was, works fine. My only complaint would be that some of the combat animations are a bit slow, and unskippable.\n\nSounds; The sounds are average. Little voice acting, which may disappoint some, for how much text there is in the story.\n\nIn conclusion; While lacking multiplayer, King's Bounty offers a more fun single player experience, in my opinion.","November 29, 2013","true","30.2"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

If you like turn based army development games like Heroes of Might and Magic, this one is great.  With 3 distinct types of hero to play and several difficulties, it is easy to find a play style that works for you while still maintaining effectiveness.  This game has no respawn (as it should be), so learning to keep your troops alive and manage your resources is paramount to victory.  The only issue I have with the game is that there is a lot of pointless running around to complete some of the quests and reinvest in troops if you have a particularly nasty encounter.  Also one warning that I do not think is really a spoiler.  There are "boss fights" in the game although many are avoidable.  For these boss fights you CANNOT use rage.  Troops and magic are fine, but not rage abilities.   I am not sure why they decided to do this, but it makes heavily rage driven characters a bit tougher to play.  Also, I strongly recommend investing in the reserves ability to mitigate the restock of troops issue a bit by keeping extras of your most fragile troops with you.\n\nThe game length is really solid with a lot to explore and many side quests to accomplish (almost necessary to be strong enough at the end to fight the tougher fights).  Also, anyone who thinks the game is too easy, just put the game on a more challenging setting and see how fast the difficulty ramps up when you are having trouble replenishing your troops.\n\nI highly recommend this game.\n","February 9, 2014","true","112.7"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

The Big differences between this game and HoMM3 are that in this one you only control one hero, and the enemy fights dont build up more if you take your time getting to them, they are all set on their difficulty when the game starts, and that your troop strength is limited by a leadership statistic of your hero's.  You can only hire as many troops at a time as your leadership stat(and your gold) allow.\n\nOne thing that I realy like about this game is the wide variety of troops that are available.  One thing I slightly dislike about the game is that some of the troops that are appealing to try using may not always be available in high enough numbers to make using them possible.  Each time you start a new game, many of the huts and castles around the map have their supply of troops somewhat randomly generated, so one unit may be usable on one playthrough and not available on the next.  this improves the games replayability, but can be frustrating if there is a particular unit you want to try out.","December 4, 2015","true","331.3"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","0"

If you decide to try this out, make sure to plan out how you spend ability runes from level one because runes seem to dry up once you start branching out your talent tree. Rage spirits get experience only from doing damage, which requires meticulous study in tactical micromanagement if you want your rage spirits to rain down mayhem in any semblance of actual destructive power (death really is your friend here). Armies are a non-renewable resource so save the best units for hard fights.\n\nI played through as a mage with subspecialization in warror talents. I focused on nurturing my spirits of icy death and did a lot of evasive wandering to pull them out of my box of tricks as early as I could. This caused a great deal of fatigue through to midgame. Then I discovered green dragons could be made invisible and battle stealthed my way to the end of the game at about level 15. The final battle was more than tricky but doable thanks to some luck and strategic perseverance: kill high initiative stacks first, attrition through invisibility + manual rage, mana regen from ice & death spirits (mana/rage regen dies out completely during long battles, otherwise mages could go into battle with a single bright-eyed fairy and come out unscathed after having vanquished the legionous hosts of evil).\n\nThere are several battles in demonland and elsewhere that aren't doable until you max out at level 30 and even then they are tough (discovered through dumplehackery cheatcodes of curiosity). Mariage is available to those who choose it, even for the hard to please suitor seeking a spouse from among the ranks of the undead or perhaps one snatched from the bituminous fires of hell. Be warned though -- good items have better stats than your own children and your children are permanently bound to an inventory slot once you decide to have them.\n\nI started Armored Princess but found my strategic palette has been sated more than I thought I knew. Imagine that: I really do miss not having death around. Also, the princess exhibits way too much sartorial irony for my taste, and similar irony was thankfully was absent in The Legend.","January 1, 2014","true","319.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

It is extremely long. It took me 95 hours to beat it, although I finished all quests. I would rather have a campaign 40 hours long with a faster level progression and play it a second time with another class. The story is mostly forgettable, and the running around to restock troops becomes tedious.\n\nBut the drawbacks are compensated by an excellent turn based combat. The variety in spells and troops allows for many different approaches to the combat, and the fact that the resources of the world are limited pushes you to try to not only win every match, but to do so while minimizing your losses.\n\nAll in all, this is a good game for those of you who enjoy turn based strategy games like Heroes of Might & Magic, and at the current 9.99EUR, it's hard to say no.","March 16, 2014","true","94.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","1"

It takes a bit of learning at the start, getting used to the battle system, but once you get the hang of it, fighting becomes more tactical and strategic.  You can't just all out fight the enemies in this game or you will lose fairly quickly.\n\nThis is one of the few games though that can actually punish you if you are losing a fight.  The fewer troops you have to deal damage, the less damage the enemies will incur.  One thing I would have liked to see however is some way of retreating from a fight without losing all your troops.  Maybe if it was just a % rather than all of them.\n\nYou have to manage your money or you could find yourself like I did many hours into the game and out of funds to hire more troops.  This can be a bad thing but it forces you to think before you act a lot more.\n\nTowards the end of the game I did find it got pretty repetitive, but overall a very enjoyable experience.

It's like the missions where you don't have a castle in Heroes of Might and Magic games, only much more fun. It takes place in a fantasy world that seems generic at first, but a healthy dose of humor and irony (and bad translations from Russian) set it apart from the rest. And some quests and artifacts you'll encounter are definitely not generic!\n\nGameplay-wise, you'll be mostly wandering around beautifully detailed areas, collecting loot, avoiding high-level baddies and looking for fights you can take on so you can level up, and so on. The fights themselves are a beautiful tactical affair, you're always trying to minimize losses and to make the best of troops you can hire locally (some people insist on making long back and forth trips to replenish troops instead of working with what they have, I think it's a fun-killer). There area many spells and special abilities to spice things up.\n\nThe only criticism I would have is that later areas of the game can be very difficult especially if you didn't make a very good character build, and there are less fun quests to lighten things up. Latter areas are also less well-designed. Overall though, you have a lot of liberty for the order in which you want to tackle the late game challenges, and finishing the game was satisfying despite having taken two year-long breaks.\n\nHighly recommended!","March 31","true","43.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Graphics are adequate, as are the sound effects while the music, gameplay and depth are pretty good.\n\nThe game is played by controlling an avatar that can be one of three classes standard role playing classes; Warrior, Mage or Paladin. The hero gallops across area maps fighting mobs of creatures, visiting towns, talking to people and gathering quests while also advancing through a storyline that involves saving the world.\n\nStoryline and dialogue are standard fare with no big surprises or stand-out characters in fact by the end of the game you may get a little tired of all the fetch quests if you've participated in the majority of the 100+ quests in the game. It's the depth of combat and the amount of characters available which give the game its high points but even this can wear thin after a while.\n\nThe avatar gains levels and power which offer powerful boosts to the troops and also expands on the avatar’s spells or rage summons that add extra flavor to offense or defense. The various kinds of troops that can be obtained do a good job of keeping things fresh but by the end every creature will have been fought numerous times so even though you haven’t personally used the creatures in your own army, you’ll be well aware of what they are capable of. It’s turn based and hex grid combat with a wide bunch of things to do. However, like in most games that can last 40+ hours, eventually combat will start to feel stale or at least it did for me.\n\nSo in all the game is very solid and enjoyable to play for the most part but I’ll definitely have to take a break before I rush off to play the other games in the series.\n\n7/10\n","December 21, 2013","true","49.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

No. Why? Because the next games in this series (Armoured Princess) is better. They both basically work almost the same way with the same mechanics but Armoured Princess is less brutally unbalanced.\n\nThe trouble with this game is that your resources are finite and as such it forces you to always play conservatively. No Zerg rushes here, you ideally want to win every battle with zero loses. If you've ever wondered what a pyrrhic victory is, this game will teach you because it's all too easy to win a battle, but be so crippled that the game is essentially unplayable. There is no way to "farm" more gold and it likely wouldn't matter anyway since (with few exception) the number of units available to buy is limited and you'll run out eventually anyway.\n\nSo what happens? You spend most of you time running around the various maps trying to pick off the weakest stacks that you can kill with out too many loses. You'll spend more time bravely running away than actually fighting.\n\nNow the same is true of Armoured Princess, but the difference is in this game, even on the first map, there are stacks you won't be able to handle until much later. So you run from map to map, picking off units, running back (sometimes way back) to restock your troops, hitting a solid wall of way overpowered stacks and then backtracking to see if any of the previously too strong stacks are now managable. It really kills your momentum, drags out the game and makes it feel really grindy. Despite the fact that most people would associate "farming" as grinding this game has found a completely different way to be grindy.","May 11, 2014","false","29.0"," 50 of 98 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","50","98","0","2"

Then you should get King's Bounty. Let me tell you why.\n\nKing's Bounty: The Legend is a reboot of a game property that was made in 1990. Drawing from the gameplay aspects of the original title, and combining it with modern graphics, a friendly interface, and some new game elements, King's Bounty: The Legend ends up being an enjoyable and polished experience. You'll do everything from treasure hunting to tactical combat, and along the way you'll need to delve into some resource management and thoughtful strategy if you want to be successful. This game does not sport some overly complex, epic story or narrative, nor should it, since its simplistic presentation is (in my opinion) part of its charm.\n\nBottom line: this is a game that will not disappoint those who are interested in the tactical RPG genre. When I first played it upon release, even I was pleasantly surprised, and I had played the original back when I was a kid. Overall, the game is a reminder that developers do not need to reinvent the wheel everytime they set out to make a good game. The formula in this title is old, but the experience itself is fresh and organic. Highly recommended.","December 22, 2013","true","3.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Everything if finite - that means army, gold, quests etc. I was slightly worried about this in the beginning but as the game progress and you unlock more and more places to buy armies this seems like it is going to be less of an issue. Everything is randomized which is good and bad - so that nice recruitment place you had before with 1100 royal snakes are now selling peasants or zombie birds.\n\n2. Story-driven. HoMM-series are straight buildarmy and smash; this one has lots of small RPG elements mixed in. I really like but I guess this can swing both ways.\n\n3. Upgrading items via special quests, awesome side-quests and seemingly great stories/quests - what is not to like about that :).\n\nI had this from an earlier humble bundle purchase and was pure luck I tried it out - I'm glad I did - I cannot emphasize enough that if you liked the homm serieis - and you have this, or see it cheap somewhere, give it try!","March 17, 2015","true","62.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MonikaWeiss/recommended/25900/","MonikaWeiss","Monika "I.Q." Weiss","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MonikaWeiss/","149 products in account","Even though King’s Bounty: The Legend is an oldie… For the price, it’s definitely a goodie and best of all, it can be played on a variety ye oldie PC configurations with a minimum 2.7Ghnz Pentium IV or faster. What I’m trying to say is that the King’s Bounty: The Legend can be played on older computers with relatively no issues but it’s always good to check the system requirements before purchasing the game. Interestingly enough for a game over 8 years old... It's dated well.\nSo what’s it all about? At it’s gaming heart, King’s Bounty: The Legend is a single-player RPG title that is reminiscent of Heroes of Might and Magic. It’s a grid based and turn based style of RPG that even though it doesn’t offer the world of gaming anything new, it is still an enjoyable experience, provided you get pleasure from these type of games. It also continues two modes of play, adventure (ala story) and battle which is straight into the crux of fighting, without the clinched storyline. In story model, their is a pseudo real-time control of the character as compared to the turn based battle mode.\nBefore starting your journey, you need to create your character or "hero" for this RPG universe from classic Dungeons & Dragons archetypes that include Warrior, Paladin and Mage. Whether you’re striking with a sword or casting a spell, the story of King’s Bounty: The Legend  will not discriminate as you attempt to help the King dispose of a threat towards his kingdom. It’s the standard good versus evil game that has the player searching the lands for quests, gold, battles and other turn based bonuses. In terms of spells, there's a plethora, around 70 which  include both defence and offence which does require some thinking to best utilise them. Another cool aspect of fighting is that you can set traps which  is slightly reminiscent of the original Final Fantasy games.\nApart from just controlling your hero, you need to navigate other characters in the game as you hire them from a variety of places to bring new members into your team like priests, archers and even monsters for example. As you progress, the ability to hire more powerful party members will come into play and eventually your party could almost take on the King’s army due to its sheer power in both steel and magic. Unlike games such as Command & Conquer or the new Starcraft, King's Bounty: The Legend keeps your parties in classic Dungeon & Dragons size, ensuring that things stick to the classic RPG formula as you attempt to outwit and out-strategy your enemies. Small is sometimes better!\nAs the game moves along, the enemies do become steadily more challenging, especially some of the boss battles that you encounter and like non tactical RPG title, you do bump into enemies at the most unusual of places. In terms of controls and the interface, King's Bounty: The Legend is well thought-out. The menus are quite accessible and the mouse/keyboard combination works well. Choosing your characters to fight or flee is all done through the mouse and the menu system.\nGraphically, the title does feel a little dated, although overall, it is quite detailed and there is some good attention to detail. It does remind me of those classic BioWare RPG games which is a good thing. The special effects of the spells are great as it the animation of the creatures in the title. My favourite aspect of the game is the audio and special effects that go hand in hand with the gameplay and really help immerse you into this world. There are some camera issues but generally this isometric type environment is quite well made to navigate and control.\nIf you love strategy games, especially tactical strategy games than King's Bounty the Legend is for you. It's a well made game that although doesn't change the face of gaming in Australia, it does give you good old fashioned RPG action, albeit turn based with decent graphics and a clichéd and over the top storyline. Definitely worth investigating... Especially for the price!\n\n","January 3","true","1.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","3","5","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/resident4t/recommended/25900/","resident4t","Captain Tight Pants","http://steamcommunity.com/id/resident4t/","521 products in account","First impressions:\n\nI haven't played this game for too long, but I'm not liking it so far. I'm trying, but the enemy encounters so far have either been ridiculously unfair(bairly doing any damage to enemies) or mind numbingly easy(require absolutely no strategy and are therefore boring). The overworld map so far also seems way too busy, with trees and such always in the way of the camera. I'm going to play some more, but so far it's been a negative experience.\n\n\n(Impression after playing for longer)\n\nGeneral thoughts on combat:\n\nEdit: Alright, I found out that you can right click an enemy to find out their difficulty, so now I'm not running in to impossible battles. I'm starting to get some strategies down (learn that ressurection spell and spam it to minimize losses). I found a camera mod, so the clausterphobic camera is gone. The battle difficulty could still be better, though. Battles still range from super easy to don't even attempt this right now. The game is starting to get it's hooks into me, since it can be relatively charming even if the humor doesn't always work. I'll continue to play it, since it's a good game to waste some time on mindlessly while watching some videos or doing other things.\n\n\nInterface:\n\nAs far as the interace goes, it could do a better job of highlighting the NPCs that sell you units on the map as it can be annoying to find them after you've visisted them once. The dedicated map itself is terrible, as it gives you less information than the mini-map --no idea how that makes any sense. I would turn the map rotation off in the options because it will just confuse you further. Quest objectives aren't marked on the map and you can't track them, so it doesn't even mark the general direction you should go in --which is all I ask really. I'm not a fan of having to check the map every few steps and you can't zoom out the mini-map at all, which would alleviate those problems.\n\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nThese all sound like negatives, but like I said this is a good game to just play through while you're doing something else. Hopefully it will pick up in a few hours since it's a fairly long game and it can afford to. My experience is improving so far and I expect that it will just keep getting better.\n\n\n\n\nJust a bit of information on the camera mod: if you make some changes to the config file yourself, just note that you need to travel to another area (go through a loading screen portal) to actually see the changes (as well as restarting the game of course, but that goes without saying). I wasn't seeing any changes to the camera and I had no idea, so just keep that in mind. Also, try not to go too crazy with the FOV setting because it will affect performance. My fov is at 40 and that seems fine.","April 4, 2014","true","15.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

It might be easier to make a list of the things I really liked.\n\n-This game has loads of charm.

For me, it was just challenging enough to get frustrated, but never so much that I wanted to quit! (Dark Souls)\n-There are actually quite a few units to use and mix and match to make your army! This can lead to some interesting battles!\n-Between the units/artifacts/hero classes, there is more than enough room for multiple run throughs.\n\nI was shocked by how much fun I had. The boss fights were actually challenging and welcomed! I was always wanting more, and I am so glad I did not miss this game! I read some reviews saying that this one can be skipped but this is not the case! DON'T MISS THIS GAME! King's Bounty: The Legend is now one of my favorite Strategy games I have ever played.\n\nI will admit that this game had some apparent language and grammar issues. This stems from being translated from Russian, but this never bothered me. You may notice an occasional "an" instead of an "a", or possibly an odd synonym choice, but it really does not bring too much of a problem.\n\nI solidly recommend this game.

The biggest problem with this game is the fact that you can royaly screw yourself over and make the game unwinnable if you don't play your cards right. You absolutely must aim for zero casualties in the first half of the game or you'll spend too much money replacing troops and then not have any gold for the powerful units later.\n\nI also can't recommend this to anyone who isn't a true tactician, the battles start to become longer and more drawn out as the game progresses and it only takes a few losses to make the rest of the game too difficult to win.","May 2, 2012","true","104.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Instead of the board game style of HoMM, it's an old school RPG style with roving bands of enemies that enage you in combat when you bump into them.  They typically block off paths or guard treasures or upgrades.  You can often squeeze past them or lead the enemies around, kiting them away from what they are guarding.  Some enemies cannot be kited away, however, especially those guarding maps that unlock new areas.\n\nCombat consists of moving around 5 stacks of units and having them attack enemies.  Many spells and units create extra units so you can flood the maps with summoned cannon fodder.  In this case you'll control more than just 5 stacks but all summoned units are temporary and either die after a few turns or disappear at the end of the combat.  Rules for combat are nearly identical to Heroes of Might and Magic and it even reuses many of the same units and spells.  This is fitting since the original King's Bounty was the precursor to the HoMM series before it was rebooted with this game over a decade after the release of the original.\n\nOnly flaws I've found with the game are that the random nature of enemy types, units you can purchase, and items / spells you can purchase can make some games nearly impossible while making others substantially easier.  A lot of players use a save game scanner utility software created by the developers of the game.  This isn't a big draw to me, I prefer to just start a game and see how far I get with what I've got.  This is only a concern on Impossible mode, on Easy, Normal, and Hard it doesn't matter as much and all games should be able to be completed.","June 20, 2014","true","157.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

In this you have a army with a turn-based mechanic and each army type is represented by a  single person that walks across the hex grid. When they take damage depending on how much it is either just harmed a single unit or killed a number of troops. You also have spells to enhance or hamper the enemy.\n\nSome items in the game can be upgraded or cursed items have the curses surpressed by entering them like Disgiea. By doing this not only is the item enhanced to better than it was before, but you get xp and gold.\n\nWhatever you equip you main character, the armyy will get those same benefits. For example a high defence will boost their defence so that they take less damage. Boosting your attack will boost their's.\n\nAll in all it's a fun game and clearly they enjoy mocking fantasy games so it pokes a little fun at itself which is often subtle and also enjoyable.

The story is light but not quite parodic. There's a plethora of side-quests, and on normal difficulty fights can be difficult even if you complete all the side-squests; the game is really long. Now for the downsides: the game is really long, and while there are a few branches, back-to-back repeat play is not recommended (even though there's multiple difficulties and main character classes). Your units will tend to get outdated or insufficient as you advance to later areas. For example, the first area you may have a large group of priests, but in the second area, the supply of priests is lacking, so you'll have to swap them for pirates or something. In other words, you can't get overly attached to a specific type of unit. Quests don't have a difficulty or level recommendation, so save frequently.\n\nThat's my actual recommendation, but this recommendation is also for the promotional event. Yay, coal!\nAlso, don't let the hours played fool you. I purchased this game a second time through steam; a complete playthrough, if my memory is accurate, took more than 40 hours... and I did not aim for anything near full completion.","December 27, 2011","true","27.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

As you progress through the game you get introduced to these new troops which really keeps the game fresh.\n\nYou also have some hero customization as well as three different skill trees you can specialize in.

Interesting Heroes of Might and Magic style hex based combat. You have troops, spells, and a hero. The main hero isn't in combat, but has spells to assist the troops, and items which confer stats and such to the troops/ determine how many troops available. Great writing, graphics have aged very nicely. The tutorial is a bit bare bones, but to be fair I've barely gone past it.

The story is light but not quite parodic. There's a plethora of side-quests, and on normal difficulty fights can be difficult even if you complete all the side-squests; the game is really long. Now for the downsides: the game is really long, and while there are a few branches, back-to-back repeat play is not recommended (even though there's multiple difficulties and main character classes). Your units will tend to get outdated or insufficient as you advance to later areas. For example, the first area you may have a large group of priests, but in the second area, the supply of priests is lacking, so you'll have to swap them for pirates or something. In other words, you can't get overly attached to a specific type of unit. Quests don't have a difficulty or level recommendation, so save frequently.\n\nThat's my actual recommendation, but this recommendation is also for the promotional event. Yay, coal!\nAlso, don't let the hours played fool you. I purchased this game a second time through steam; a complete playthrough, if my memory is accurate, took more than 40 hours... and I did not aim for anything near full completion.","December 27, 2011","true","27.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game is challenging and the story is ok.\nThe best thing in this game is the possibility to adjust your army as the game goes on. You start with rather weak humans and animals and as you conquer new region, you get access to stronger humans and animals but also dwarves, elves, undeads, demons and orks. The other thing I like is the skill tree of your hero. Depending on your class, you will have to decide which of the other classes' skills you want to skip (at least on hard).\nThe fighting system might be similar to the Heroes of Might and Magic Games, but the rest of the game definitely isn't. You only have one hero, no towns but multiple castles and taverns to recruit units and - probably most important - you cannot have an arbitrary number of units in one stack, they are limited by your leadership.\nHowever, there is still room for improvements which is shown in the other King's Bounty games like Armored Princess.\n\n9/10","August 25, 2015","true","79.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But the tactical gameplay is tightly composed, varied and often quite brutal. Units are a limited resource such that when your most rare and powerful allies fall in battle you are not simply losing money and time. You feel like you are truly losing soldiers, losing pieces of your finely tuned army such that it must soon be redesinged and rebuilt around new tactics.\n\nKing's Bounty is turn-based tactical battling at it's finest. Like a more complex and inelegant form of chess, it can be played casually or seriously. I highly recommend it. Besides, how many games require you to engage in a mystical battle for supremacy everytime you upgrade one of your magical items? I've lost half an army to my damn equipment without successfully improving it's function just yet ... and I wouldn't have things any other way.","December 30, 2011","true","32.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

My favorite aspect of strategy games is their inherently open-ended nature. Will you focus on crippling the enemy's economy, or engage them directly.

Most of the choices made are subtle differences at best.","May 10","false","19.6"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

I played for roughly 25 hours, and it never got fun.\n-The battles were frustrating, since the computer gives an insanely large edge to the tactics of it's own troops. They will get to go dead last on a turn, and first on the next turn. They will "wait" to act before I tell my troops to wait (specifically to let the enemies move within range), but my characters will be forced to act first.\n-Ridiculously overpowered enemies/quests will be interspersed in the beginning areas, so you'll get a quest but won't be able to complete it for 6 more character levels.\n-Money is over-abundant but runes are nonexistant.\n-You can actually run out of troops to resupply your army with.\n-Everything is pre-determined before battles. If you re-load a game and enter a battle again, the enemies will move to the exact same squares, and EVERY unit will do the exact same amount of damage when you attack.\n\nThis isn't strategy, it's rote memorization.","April 2, 2011","true","24.8"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

It's a turn based strategy game with bright graphics and wonderful music. The storyline and writing are average at best and the gameplay is repetitive and soon becomes dull.  Take note this game is NOT an rpg as some other reviewers have stated.  There is no roleplay in this game outside of choosing between which of the 3 classes you wish to play.  All conversations with NPC's are circular and come down to either accepting or declining a quest.  With xp being a premium commodity you do not wish to refuse any quests.\n\nThe sudden spikes in gameplay challenge can only be described as unbalanced.   You seemingly walk over battles with ease or they are overly difficult.   The latter may not be such a problem if your army's troops were easily replenished but as there is a limited number of troops for purchase it can you leave your hero weak and unable to progress.  To progress smoothly through this game you cannot afford to take any losses from battles.\n\nWhilst this game is cheap, don't waste your money.","September 8, 2015","false","6.6"," 2 of 13 people (15%) found this review helpful","15","2","13","0","0"

The lack of movement restraint felt great in "KB", the rotating camera is fine and the way you expand your army is OK. But this game lacks a decent story (at least until I gave up playing it, after almost 10 hours), there's a lot of backtracking and, worst of all, combat is very bad.\n\nI played as a Paladin on Normal difficulty, but the game is extremely easy and doesn't require much strategy. Levelling up and customizing your character's ability trees are not very enticing, either.\n\nIn a nutshell, I got bored and didn't want to play anymore. It's not a revoltingly bad game, it's just not interesting or challenging enough to be worthy of my time.\n\nNow I wonder if I should play "Armored Princess" and "Crossworlds" (I got them in a bundle with this one)...","July 27, 2015","false","9.6"," 5 of 20 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","5","20","0","3"

The game's writing takes advantage of the cheesy fantasy setting by coupling it with cheesy fantasy humor that always gets a laugh. The graphics are top notch, the music has a very nice ambient quality, and each different troop type, some being demons, dragons, humans, dwarves, elves, and orcs, amonst others, brings its own different playstyle to the battles. The difficulty does have its ups and downs, such as the path to a boss fight being extremely easy but the boss being immensly tough even after all possible side-quests have been completed, and the game does have its fair share of bugs. Overall, a fun strategy RPG with a main story that takes upwards of 40 hours, leading to lots of entertainment.","July 13, 2012","true","75.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Hell, even some of the individual unit abilities are similar, such as horsemen doing more damage if they move a number of hexes on their turn. That said, it does what it does pretty well.

Couldnt get enough. When this remake was announced I was excited at the propect of it. The game is not an aboluste copy but more of a new type of collect em power up RPG TBS game.\n\nI really enjoyed it and it took a good long time to complete. I do have some gripes though, mainly I liked in the oringal how you could get to the last world almost right away. Power differences were crazy and how you could find a dragon in the first level. It was a time when you finished your games in under 4 hours and this version does not cater for that. It has a slow creep using tiers of enemies you expect to use.\n\nSecondly, there is serious repetition in the fights. I cant remember if it is this game or one of its sequels but they threw in some end of boss fights that broke the mould and were suddenly very interesting. I want mor eof those type fights.\n\nAnd my last gripe, if you are to have a long played out game like this I'd like to see more variety in the troops you collect. I'd love to see groups of your minions get upgrades or learning new stuff. Yes, thats a tricky one to handle but why not, several other games do it, even if its rewarding them in tiers of upgrades and adding new troops dumbs it down again. I dont know, Im not the dev.

It's a great fix of some classical fantasy TBS, if Heroes isn't doing it for you. The only difference is the adventure map being real-time. So no multiplayer is possible. Either than that, it's got a nice semi-original setting, with the traditional high fantasy feel. It's  a great game for relaxation - the soundtrack is superb in that aspect.\nAll in all, a must buy if you're a Heroes fan.

Having most monster encounters be around the same difficulty range in a given area means that you will most likely retreat to reinforce your army before risking another battle making the constant roadtrips to the castle a necessary chore ( even if it makes sense in game/lore terms of you not been able to make troops out of thin air on the spot ).\n2. Most if not all new players will probably only use the default human troops since those become available in infinity quantities ( in the shop not your army ) rather than use exotic troops who you can't fill their respective army slot since there's none being sold anymore.","December 16, 2015","true","82.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I will definitely keep playing though.\n\nI love turn-based strategy and I love the way they have mixed up the levels of the enemies in the various areas so you can't just attack everyone from the beginning and complete any quest. If you want a more linear time follow the main quest, otherwise just go off and explore the areas and some great battling opportunities.\n\nI had so much fun with side quests I didn't even know what rage was for, for 10 hours at least, until I went back to the main quest...\n\nMy favourite time was in the Marshan swamp, some of the local troops were really fun to use here, although definitely needed holy troops in the cemetary. But this brings up a point that others have mentioned - use the troops that are local to the area rather than trudging back for the troops you are comfortable with. You can collect and keep many items that will improve the stats of certain kinds of troops, and your strategic ability will improve if you have to adapt to use what is available.\n\nFor example there is something which will improve your snakes damage which makes them extremely powerful at one point in the game where they are locally available. When you move on, maybe you can use that other item when you are surrounded by pirates and sea, and use them to fight a load of ship battles where they have advantage.\n\nWhen underground maybe develop a skill that gives you a bonus in that area and remember the local troops fight better in darkness too. If you don't match that your super tough royal troops might suddenly look lame.\n\nGreat value for money!!
