"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/279260/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","A second ice age has descended upon us. The world has frozen over, obliterating civilization and government, leaving anyone but the highest up to fend for themselves in a world that has gone completely to hell. But deep underground, Richard lives out his life in a well outfitted prison, away from the horror that humanity has become, watching nature documentaries and contacting the guards through his personal computer when something breaks or he’s in need of assistance. If it wasn’t for the iron bars confining him, it would almost seem a rather pleasant place to wait out the cold. The only thing possibly missing, is someone, anyone to talk to, and as if summoned by a support ticket Alice appears in the cell opposite him. If only things were as simple as they appear.\n\nRichard and Alice isn’t the story it first appears to me. Behind the easygoing life the inmates of this peculiar prison seem to live, incredible amounts of despair and heartbreak are pressing at the gate, eating away at the humanity of those who have to bare with the insanity that has brought the world to the brink of almost complete desertion. There are no heroes or villains in this tale; there are simply people, trying their hardest to survive in the midst of impossible odds, doing whatever it takes to live another day despite how meaningless it may seem.\n\nParallels can be drawn between Richard and Alice and literary masterpieces such as The Road, and certainly it isn’t a premise that we haven’t seen done before (to varying degrees of effect). What makes Owl Caves’s take on it unique, especially in a medium that rarely attempts (let alone succeed at), is the unprecedented level of humanity in its characters and the skill at which they so eloquently explore the darkest side of us in a way that’s neither heavy handed or moralizing. This isn’t a story that is trying to make you believe in something; to show what’s right and wrong, with infallible characters that ultimately make the right choice.\n\nOn the contrary, Richard and Alice is fascinating because it never chooses a side or try to make you see some presumed moral truth. Its characters are flawed individuals, doing terrible things that from the outside seem almost inhuman. But can we truly say that when forced into a corner with no alternatives, we too wouldn’t shed our morality and do whatever it takes to survive, rationalizing it however we must to keep from tearing ourselves apart from the inside? Richard and Alice is a shameless look at the animals we all become when forced under pressure, and it’s shocking not because of incredible amounts of violence or grotesque situations, but because we know deep down that we are all capable of such atrocities.\n\nIt’s hard to say if I actually “enjoyed” Richard and Alice. It’s an incredibly bleak adventure that at times is hard to stomach from how emotionally taxing just being such a hopeless world is, let alone what occurs within it. It’s not a “fun” game (or really much of a game at all in many ways), but it is an immensely well crafted experience that does more with less than a handful of characters in just a few hours, than most games ever manage. It’s a captivating character study, that absorbed me from the second I set foot inside Richard’s extravagant cell up until its undecided ending, which leaves just enough unanswered to keep you wondering and filling in the gaps yourself. Some might say its lazy storytelling, but to me it was the only possible way to end a story that was never going to have a happy or finite conclusion. After all, the world is still turning, and humanity along with it, through the best and worst of times.\n\nFull disclosure: Richard and Alice was reviewed using a copy of the game provided by the developer.

Not my cup of tea. I always found them frustrating, and often found myself being stuck at a certain point with no ambition to carry on. Richard & Alice however.\n\nThis game is  wow\n\nYou begin your journey in a frozen apocalypse, the world ravaged by the cold. Soicety has fallen, gang warfare is at an all time high. One of our centre pieces, Richard, are tucked away safe from the devastation in a prison that is secluded from the hell above. As you begin to chat with your new in-mate Alice, you slowly discover that she has had a very dark time surviving the end of the world. This game charts her memories of her devasating and heartbreaking experience with her son as they trek across the wasteland in search for salvation.\n\nThis tale is one of the most human I have ever came across in a video game. I genuinely felt myself caring for these characters, which some recent games have failed to make me do. In this point-and-click "walking simulator" you watch this horrofying story unfold in front of you, and you are tasked with choosing how you want things to go.\n\nChoice is a very subtle feature in this game, and if you do not carefully think through every dialouge sequence and opportuniy brought forward too you will suffer the consequences when the game comes to a close.\n\nFor a rather short adventure, Richard & Alice is amazing, and will certainly leave you heartbroken and satisfied. This game has a story better than most AAA games out there, and it is dirt cheap. Get this game, you will never forget it.\n\n+ Amazing story\n+ Makes good use of choice\n+ Character development and pacing is well done. You will be glued to the screen.\n\n- Backtracking can get a little annoying\n- Some sequences are a bit short\n\n10/10","June 8, 2014","true","3.1"," 55 of 65 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","55","65","0","0"

The plot was interesting, the overall metaphor was great and I wasn't terribly bothered by the less than stellar graphics, but the gamplay is poor and overall I found this game predictable, easy and bland. The level designs left a lot to be desired (lots of open space which is painstakingly slow to move across, tons of repeated sprites/tiles, almost no interactivity with anything), useless "cut scenes" that are used over and over. Most of the story focuses on Alice, there isn't enough background on what Richard was going through.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/virotti/recommended/279260/","virotti","virotti","http://steamcommunity.com/id/virotti/","2079 products in account","Overview:\n\nThe focus of this game is a moving, post-apocalyptic story. Two people are locked up together in a world covered with ice, and Alice tells how she got there, and so you are able to play as Alice during each part of her story.\nThis is a mature and very sad story, with very strong and heart wrenching questions, so do not expect anything cheerful.\n\nGameplay:\n\nSimple point and click interface, with only the left and right mouse buttons to interact or the ENTER button in the keyboard to skip conversations (hold to skip faster). Simple puzzles that make sense and are logical, but not very challenging. I only got stuck once, because I did not know what I was supposed to do.\n\nSound:\n\nAmazing sound effects that make you feel the bleakness of the environment. Really good!\n\nVoice: None, only subtitles for dialogs\n\nGraphics:\n\nSimple but functional, not a problem for a story-focused game like this. Just make sure you configure the game (setup) before launching to play it in fullscreen and use Directx 3D 9. You'll need to copy and paste the game's exe file ("richardandalice.exe") and rename the copy as "richardandalice_steam_final.exe". Then just click on the game through steam and choose setup while starting it to uncheck "Run in a window instead of Fullscreen" and change the Graphics Driver to Directx 3D 9.\n\nStory:\n\nVery well written for an indie game, it makes you want to know what is going to happen next. There are many possible endings, and it was not hard to get them all with a guide, after I was finished with the game. By the way, I recommend saving in the beginning of each scene to help you come back later for the other endings.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis is a great game if you like story rich games that make you think and get involved with the game world. If you want hard puzzles, fast action or shining graphics, look elsewhere.\n\nIf you have any further doubts or need any help, please post a comment.

It is a story based game that has a focus on the narrative. That being said the simple style of the game talks to the simplicity of Owl Cave’s vision. It’s slightly bland in some cases but never looks bad and I think that it is a fitting look and feel for the game as a whole. There isn’t a great deal of audio in the game but hearing eerie music and raging winds did convey a sense of unease and foreboding that added a much needed layer to the game, something above reading endless reels of text while waiting for the chance to solve the puzzles.\n\nRichard and Alice has multiple endings so it is worth playing through a couple of times however once you know where to use item A all of the challenge has gone from the game. If you are a fan of point and click adventures then it would be value for money, unfortunately with no real replayability past the couple of endings and there’s not much else to expect from this game for anyone other than hardcore point and click fans.","March 2","true","3.2"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","17","17","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cussbrother/recommended/279260/","cussbrother","A WINDSHIELD WIPER","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cussbrother/","861 products in account","The developers seem to be browsing Steam reviews, which leaves me in an interesting dilemma. If I plunge forth with my typical double-fisted, pull-no-punches Steam Review vitriol, a developer will no doubt respond and be very civil and infect me with Sh­ithead's Remorse. However, if I soften the laser-focused, razor-sharp barbs of my serpent's cybertongue - making it "constructive" criticism, if you will - they may just mark the review as "helpful" and offer no further comment, hence leaving me open to accusations of being a "sellout" with no easy rebuttal. Hence, this hand-wringing introductory paragraph which hopefully is even more of a tedious chore to read than it was to type. Anyway, trigger warnings: Constructive Criticism, lack of excessively brutal cyberdunks and net.owns.\n\nIn an age of everlasting betas, this game stands out as an ironic example of a game that could really stand a final coat of paint before being shoved out the door. The story is mildly captivating (though both "twists" were readily predictable by the fifth game-day or so), but the script is pretty rough and could stand to be re-edited once more. Maybe English baby formula contains mercury or extra lead or something, but no American 5 year old would be quite this, er, saccharine. Even if artificial syrupy sweetness was the intent, there's still more effective ways to capture the hyperactivity of youth than "la-la-la, tra-la-la" repeated three or four times in a row. Characters in this game tend to speak in tangents, rather than as people - again, this may or may not be part of the post-apocalyptic intent, but if it's the intent, the dialogue should still be punched up a bit and made a bit less stiff and clinical. The script feels like the words someone would use in a script, rather than either natural dialogue or natural writing - one or the other would be the way to go.\n\nLeaving the script aside, the "game" itself could also stand a brief "final revision". I typically don't mind a bit of backtracking here and there, but when the backtracking involves clicking multiple times on a huge scrolling screen, waiting for the droopy little character to trundle across before the screen scrolls enough to click again, it gets extremely tedious extremely quickly (to say nothing of the incessant CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH sound of the character in question walking through packed snow). A cardinal rule of adventure games is to try to keep each scene on a single screen if at all possible. I appreciate that the developers wanted to capture a bit of distance, but zooming the perspective out to an "overworld map" style would be so much better than depicting an entire "neighborhood" at the same scale as a single prison room. There's absolutely nothing "interesting" in between point A and point B that warrants such close zoom - no background fluff to click on and get a cute little scene-building dialogue reaction, and of course nothing particularly interesting to look at.\n\nFinally, the story itself is "told" in a labyrinthine mix of tangent-dialogue, soliloquies [violating the Show Don't Tell Principle, but ehhh], and scraps of paper / journal entries which are presented rather non-linearly; confusing to form a narrative from and quite easily forgotten. This impacts the ending somewhat, as it makes it pretty hard to figure out exactly why the various characters in the ending emphasize the little details they do. I'm not someone who demands compact, simple, everything-explained scripts (for instance, I quite like how the game left a certain element - which those have played it can no doubt guess - pretty much a zen "so, this happened") - but, on the other hand, figuring out the various in-world factions, and the various characters within those factions, and what said factions did to other factions, and the little dramas and personal conflicts in between said factions, is pretty critical to understanding the ending beyond a surface-level "oh, yeah, this guy was a _____, I knew that was coming since the midpoint" -- but figuring that stuff out involves piecing together a handful of paper scraps and non-linear breadcrumbs.\n\nSo basically what you're left with is a moderately interesting setting, some random Adventure Game Style Puzzles (USE [INVENTORY] ON [BACKGROUND ITEM], ad infinitum), and some decent atmospheric music all brought down by a heavy-handed "rough draft" script, tedious backtracking, and characters who - mostly as a result of the unpolished script - are pretty hard to give a sh­it about one way or the other. If one digs a bit, there's easily the makings of a game worth $5.99 here, but what's on display isn't that game.","July 1, 2014","false","4.6"," 41 of 61 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","41","61","0","1"

There's both good and bad points and overall, I can't recommend it.\n\nAlright, let's get the bad done with.\nThe walking is terribly slow for such a big map, I dreaded getting to a point where I had to walk. I understand why the map is big I guess, it needs it for the story, to show the wasteland off. But it was very hard to get through the walking without wanting to do something else.\nThe story isn't so great. It is a really good concept, a wasteland of snow, the world coming to an end, but I don't think we saw enough. We didn't know much about the gangs, we didn't get much story from Alice's early predicament (before the game advanced a bit). It just seemed to lack a little, as I feel did the characters personalities.\nThe gameplay. It was difficult to know what to do, this is one of the games where you click everything together and hope for the best, at one point I had to bring up a walkthrough. Of course there are many people that enjoy this kind of game, but I seemed a bit too lost for most of it. Also, during the game you pick up notes and stuff to make the overall story, but I couldn't piece it together.

This game is, in my opinion, below average in all regards. I'll start by the technical aspects, then go to gameplay/design choices, and finally I'll discuss the plot (I'll put it under spoilers, know that I will discuss all the twists, so don't read it if for some reason walking blind into a story is important for you).\n\nRichard & Alice uses the Adventure Games Studio engine, a freeware development tool specific for point and click games, although it has been used for other genres from time to time. The game is functionally fine, the sounds are sparse but okay, and the music fits the theme, even if it's not memorable. The game is also very short, even if you wander around like I did, you should take about 2 hours to complete it. Not much else to say, the game doesn't stray away from the classic point and click formula, so everything works as expected, although I have seen more impressive uses of the engine.\n\nThe gameplay, despite its semplicity, manages to be disappointing thanks to the incredibly slow movement speed, paired with a couple of large, empty screens, making exploration (or back-tracking) a painful experience. Most puzzles are very easy, although I would argue one in particular is asinine in the round about way you have to go through in order to solve it. Also disappointing is just how little gameplay there is, even for a point and click. The way the ending you get is determined is probably the only clever-ish thing about it, although the results are obfuscated by how indirect some of the cause-effect links are. There is a certain amount of forced back-tracking, which is not only slow, as mentioned before, but takes you through supremely bland screens. The art is subpar, It's even less interesting than standard RPGmaker tiles, and calling it functional is probably the only praise you can bestow upon it.\n\nThe plot is not really great. If you can't tell the first plot twist in the first 5 minutes, you probably aren't very observant, or are completely unable to detect obvious storytelling devices. The second twist is slightly harder to predict, but still qualifies as a no brainer, and these are really the only surprises in the game, the rest is played out in a completely straight manner. The world building is incredibly stupid, there is no rhyme nor reason for how society seems to be organized (what little you can see or hear of it), several events are left without explanations, the dialogues are just painful (I can't tell if the kid is supposed to have some learning disabilities, or if they just poorly imitated a 5 year old, and at least a few of the rare "existential" dialogues are bland and trite, something you have likely heard before). Point and click games live and die by their story and characters, and this game doesn't provide witty, interesting, smart or likeable characters, and has to rely on the emotional crutch of family bonds for the most part just to be relatable.\n\nNow, for the spoilers:\n\nThe kid is dead. It's painfully obvious, and the fact that is portrayed as a reveal it's a joke. The kid at least isn't as bad as children in other games, but only barely so. It's a cheap narrative tool that doubles as a way to manipulate you into feeling sorry for the characters. Whenever it's convenient, he'll do stupid stuff and be oblivious to his surroundings, so that you can have the story move forward, but he'll also be mature when required (and get sick to the point of no return, too). Thankfully, the game is short, so they can't drag this for too long, but it's still obvious and disappointing. You'll find several notes to read through the game, and not reading them all can affect the ending (very, VERY hard to miss them, unless you do so deliberately to get the other endings, which means you must have read a guide to know about it). The writing is a mixed bag in terms of quality here, some give you some interesting hints about what's going on, some are meant to paint the bleakness of this world, but it often isn't well put together, lacks depth or emotion, is generally unnecessary. Richard doesn't get much screen time, so you have to rely on the notes and the final parts of the game, to really flesh him out a bit. He is still a clichè, but at least he didn't mercy kill his own blood like Alice did, so at least he isn't THAT cliched. Alice is a joke, her lines are often baffling and awkward beyond the authors' intentions, (see the exchanges with Richard, or even the dialogue with the mysterious stranger in the church, supposedly the moral turning point that leads her to the decision to kill her son). The world building is disappointing, all is referred to in vague terms, but still that's what drives the characters to do what they do, something more substantial would be greatly appreciated. The game is short, so really there isn't anything worthwhile to mention beyond this.\n\nIn conclusion, despite me being very negative in the review, the truth is that it's "just" a subpar game. Do not buy it, (there are much better games that tackle serious themes, while doing a much better job) unless you are really into point and click and you completely ran out of other games to play in the genre, and even then do not buy at full price, you can find better games for free, so spend your money wisely.","October 15, 2015","false","2.4"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

You can see the love that's been poured into it, and it feels mean-spirited to give it a thumbs down when it is exactly the genre i most enjoy, but it just doesn't quite work.\n\nRichard & Alice is an indie adventure game, primarily narrative driven and with minimal puzzles. It might have worked better without the puzzles, since they are all fairly contrived, but that's not a big deal. The dialog between the two title characters in cells opposite from one another is quite good and those emotional beats are the highlight of the game. Unfortunately the flashbacks ruin the whole setup. These focus on an extremely annoying child and his mother's cringe-inducing babytalk and insipid doting. About 5 minutes in you will want them both to die painfully, but instead of the story progressing past that stage you have to sit through a whole nother hour of it. Eventually the game rushes to tie everything up in a 2 minute finale that doesn't have any emotional weight because the motivations revealed in the flashbacks were so shallow. It's a real shame, because the basic concept has a lot of promise.\n","April 9","false","2.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nullpointerx/recommended/279260/","nullpointerx","nullPointer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nullpointerx/","467 products in account","Richard and Alice strikes me as a hybrid mix of point & click adventure meets visual novel.  Let's start out with the high points here.  The story of Richard and Alice is absolutely compelling with a particular high note being the well written dialog between characters.  The conversational segments in the game flow naturally and realistically.  At no point did the dialog seem stilted or poorly written.  This is a particularly notable feat when one considers the amount of dialog between Alice and her 5 (and a half!) year old son Barney.  It's hard to write children's dialog between parent and child in such a way that it seems natural.  Most novels can't get this sort of thing right, let alone the medium of video games.  I think you almost have to be a parent yourself in order to effectively write this sort of dialog, and IMO Richard and Alice excels at it.  Creating emotional connection between the player and the in game characters is critical to this games success, and thankfully it nails this part.\n\nThe game also presents itself as an interesting piece of sci-fi.  The near future dystopia has been done to death for ages untold at this point, but Richard and Alice neatly avoids most of the typical tropes and clichés of this setting in that it never waves its world around in your face.  The setting here merely serves as a backdrop for the unfolding human drama, but for the most part leaves the concrete dystopian details as part of that backdrop.  It's a largely successful approach as it (rightly, IMO) assumes most players are sophisticated enough to be well versed in the rules of such a world by virtue of previous exposure in the form of other games, film, and books.  It effectively tells you what you need to know of the world in order to move the plot along and leaves the rest to imagination.\n\nThe gameplay is largely successful but equally does falter in some areas.  The point and click adventure elements here are fairly straight forward and rote.  There are only three relatively confined areas to explore in the game (four if you're feeling exceedingly generous).  Further, the level of interactivity in these areas is limited in such a way as to effectively move you from point A to point B in the story without a lot of tarrying about.  If you're seeking a richly vibrant, highly interactive point & click title, Richard and Alice is not necessarily going to give you that.  The world here exists as a plot device, and the interactive elements within that world are strictly limited to those that serve the plot in some way.  So yes, this is a rather tightly wound narrative without the indulgence of unnecessary distractions.  Having said that, Richard and Alice incorporates some interesting game mechanics in service to that world and to the general tone of the game.  Much has been made of the fact that character movement feels extremely sluggish, and believe me it does, it really, really does.  It's my opinion though, that this was a conscious decision on the part of the developers.  The slow movement combined with the relentless sound of the snow ratchets up the tension and anxiety in the game, particularly when there are other characters in peril.  It makes the world feel claustrophobic and as if it's actively working against you.   It doesn't make it any less frustrating mind, but it is ultimately an effective decision.\n\nThe one other aspect of the game play that troubles me a bit is that of the multiple endings offered here.  There are no less than five possible endings for Richard and Alice, which would seem to indicate the possibility of a branching story line.  To be clear on this point, there are absolutely no branches along the way in this story.  The ending you get is strictly based on rather arbitrary in-game choices that do not affect the narrative in progress whatsoever.  So if you want to see the multiple endings, you'll play through the exact same story multiple times with the only points of differentiation being the endings themselves.  It's as if you're reading a Choose Your Own Adventure book in which the only story deviation occurs in the final two pages of the book.  Now to be clear the story is excellent, and IMO it does warrant at least one additional play through to pick up on the clues and hints that you may have missed the first time around.  But to play through the game five times introduces a sense of drudgery and tedium, particularly when coupled with the slow character movement mentioned above.  More damningly it also reduces some of the emotional wallop present in the game with each additional playthrough.  Accordingly, if you're going for multiple playthroughs I'd recommend taking a suitable cool down period in betwixt.\n\nI'd recommend this game to fans of visual novels (slightly more so than fans of adventure games), as well as to anyone who appreciates quality storytelling coupled with quality characterization in games, especially so this latter element.","January 19, 2015","true","6.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/badhairqueen/recommended/279260/","badhairqueen","badhairqueen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/badhairqueen/","55 products in account","OverviewIntriguing story set in a post-apocalyptic world that centres around a man named Richard and his prisoner counterpart, Alice. You take turns playing as either Richard or Alice, though Alice's part is far greater, and her story is told entirely through flashbacks (i.e. events that have already transpired).\n\nWhat I liked    Good story - Far too predictable for my liking, but still interesting. The use of flashbacks as a way of unfolding the tale was fascinating; I always felt like I wanted to find out more and that kept me playing.\nHas a proper ending - I hate games where they leave you hanging and don't resolve things adequately if at all. Thankfully, Richard & Alice is not one of those games.\nInteresting setup - You experience playing as someone in a jail cell, and another outside roaming in the open world. Nice contrast.\nExciting - Has its fair share of drama and even gore, though the gore part could've been amped up 1000 times more yet. (Pixel blood isn't all that shocking, especially in minute quantities.)\nGraphics are ok - AGS-type scenery here, but it worked. (Except for the character artwork which I didn't like. See point #5 under "What I didn't" below.)\nHas a bit of replay value - If you missed out on achievements. See point below.\nMany achievements - A handy way of seeing if you missed out on any story elements. Upon first completing the game I realised I'd missed out on several; will replay to get them.\nWhat I didn't    Too short - Approximately 2+ hours max for me. Most of it was spent clicking through looooong conversations, or reading picked up notes and stuff.\nNo challenge at all - Partly because of the limited screens available to you (see point below), the answers as to what to do next were way too obvious, especially since there were so few inventory items too.\nLimited exploration - At any point of time, only 1-3 screens are accessible. Most of the time it's just 1.\nSome puzzles didn't make sense - In one instance, you must find a tray and use it, even though you quite clearly have a notebook and newspaper which could be used for the exact same purpose. Thumbs down for non-creative puzzle-solving!\nCharacters are cutesy-looking sprites - Didn't work for me. We have a really serious story which tackles many heavy issues here, so I'd have appreciated more "adult-looking" characters and not some manga-ish kawaii dwarf people. It really undermined the whole affair. There is the right game for anime-style peeps, and this ain't one of 'em.\nNo voice - Being nitpicky here, but if you consider the game was like 80% conversation, this would've greatly added to the atmosphere.\nBarebones sound & music - No music in many scenes; just background sound. Many a time it was silence, or felt akin to it. Seemed kinda empty.\nSummaryI grabbed this during sale at S$1.62 (~US$1.15). Probably wouldn't pay more than what I did for it, due to the short length and limited adventure game puzzling. But the story was a breath of fresh air and I don't regret the experience at all.","February 29","true","7.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/arcanumzero/recommended/279260/","arcanumzero","arcanum.zero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/arcanumzero/","372 products in account","This is one of those games that makes me wish there was a neutral rating option on Steam -- a sort of "indifferent shrug" between the thumbs up and thumbs down.  I got the game practically for free thanks to a Steam coupon -- without it I would probably never have realized that it existed.  It was a way to spend a few hours.  I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it but I also don't care about it enough to try for the alternate endings.\n\nIn a genre awash with truly abominable games going back decades, many from large, reputable developers, Richard and Alice does not deserve to be lumped in with the awful majority.  It is not a bad game.  But neither is it particularly inspired.  I don't feel strongly enough about the game to give it a thumbs down, but be warned that you'll probably only /like/ this game if you are a big fan of adventure games and also bleak drama.\n\nI can't even call the game post-apocalyptic, because while the game is clearly post-apocalyptic the apocalypse in this case is the most banal thing imaginable.  No zombies or battle cars here.  Not even a radioactive or biohazardous wasteland.  And that kind of sums up the story, here -- it's got the set-up to be something, but it's just not compelling.  The characters aren't unlikable, they're just bland.  The story isn't boring, it's just hollow.\n\nThe puzzles never really had me scratching my head, although I did have to cheat once because there is an item the game tells you is present but hidden from view in one chapter and you have to remember and go back for it in a later chapter.  I did not.\n\nWhy they don't just give you the item immediately is unclear to me, but there is a running theme of a lack of consideration toward the player in the game.  At one point you need to reach something in the middle of a lake.  You can't reach it from this side of the lake, though -- the game makes you walk all the way around to the other side, where the gap is slightly narrower.\n\nIncompetech.com did the music in the game.  I like Macleod's work.  I also like his graph paper.\n\nThe graphics are simple but they serve their purpose.  The weird thing about the graphics is how many graphical settings the game has.  Up to 8x anti-aliasing!  2560x1600 resolution!  One of the settings is labeled "powerful CPUs only."  I'm not sure what that means, because this game doesn't look like it should strain an abacus.\n\nI'm not criticizing -- I'm not a big believer in HD/4K/ultra-high nonsense, and you can see what the graphics look like in the screenshots above.  If it's going to turn you off, don't buy the game.  But honestly, they're not so bad that they're a point against.\n\nIn short, Richard and Alice is serviceable.  I won't be so cruel as to call it forgettable, but it is certainly not memorable.  If you like adventure games and stories about the worst parts of parenthood, the dark side of humanity, and snow, it might just be worth your six bucks.","February 15","true","3.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

I personally feel what makes an adventure game memorable is a good story with intriguing characters. Richard & Alice are both interesting characters that feel fleshed out and believable. After I completed the game, I'm still thinking back to the encounters the two had. The writing has a great "voice" helping you imagine all the dialogue. I don't want to say much about the story because I feel that could ruin it. I actually wanted to know even more of the background! Just know that it's story is a little dark. The game is not a long game (maybe 3 hours), but this game is a high quality experience. R&A has multiple endings based on decisions making me want to eventually go back and play again once I "kind of forgot" some of the conversations. It would be a mistake to miss out on this game.\n\nThe graphics are good, but funny thing - personally I wanted more trees in the stage layouts!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/279260/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","First I thought this was an RPG Maker game. It's nothing of the sort, so don't be mistaken due to the artstyle.\n\nOwl Cave, the developing team, is clearly fond of old-school point n' click games, and this is exactly that! Honestly, there isn't much to it, as a game, to make it stand out. It doesn't have any interesting mechanic, or anything of the sort. It's visual and audio design is also very minimal.\nWhere it shines, however, is in its story! I've taken a few points to write about, but it's mostly about how they could have made it more of a game, and also overcome the downsides of old point n' clicks, with their very sluggish movement, and some frustrating puzzle design.\n\nThis game avoids most of that, though, using the puzzles merely to get you more into the story. I will not, of course, review the story, and I'll avoid spoilers, but I'm very positive on it, overall.\n\n\nPresentation\nThis is, by far, the weakest aspect of the game!\nI've seen some people disappointed, claiming it's "MSPaint Graphics". It's not that bad, for sure. But you can definitely understand that reaction. It has a very low resolution, and also simple and outdated tile sets. The structures' perspective is also a bit off...\nAll in all, this is not something you'll play for sight-seeing in the least. However, it has just enough to carry the story, and giving each scene the right atmosphere, in this barren and anarchic world.\n\nUnfortunately, it's very static, which is okay, but I would have liked it not to have been in one particular aspect: the character portraits. They're always the same! I realize that it was perhaps more work than it warranted, but it was a chance to add a lot of personality into the game, as I see it. Just having the portraits be in sync with their tone. Heh, it's not very important, but could have been better.\n\nThe music seems to be equally as low-fi, strangely enough. It's not 8 or 16 bit or anything like that, but it somehow feels... old? It's strange to describe it. But it's mostly ambience music and sound effects, complementing the visuals to set the stage for the dialog. I found it surprisingly fitting in the game.\nEverything loops well and nothing felt out of place.\n\nThere is no voice-acting.\n\nI appreciated the writting quite a lot! You can understand the tone in each character's line, and the dialogue options that they give you are always legitimate. I'll talk about this further ahead, but there are a few choices that will affect the endings, although you may not initially realize it.\n\n\nGeneral Structure\nThere are 2 main characters in Richard & Alice, unsurprisingly. You're both in a prison, and all you can do is talk to each other, in separated cells. Mostly,it's about you, Richard, listening to Alice's story, about how she got there.\nThe game alternates between the characters. The smallest chunk of the game is in the cells, where you play as Richard, speak to Alice, and solve some very minor puzzles. It also helps you understand the world around you a bit more.\nThe biggest chunk, is where you play as Alice and her son, Barney, following how she was "arrested".\n\nThe prison sections are mostly there to break up the pacing, which is surprisingly good! The game never felt tiresome or to drag on as a result.\n\n\nPuzzles and Gameplay\nThe first thing you'll notice, is how sluggish the movement is. You shouldn't be unfamiliar with it, if you're used to point n' click games... it's always their sore spot!\nThis game is just the same. It's a bit awkward to move, and even to pick things up. You left click to use and right click to inspect. And that's basically all you need to know.\nYou can also advanced dialogue by clicking, skipping to the next line. There's a way to skip a scene entirely (scenes which you do not control) by holding SpaceBar -- This is never explained in the game...\n\nYou can always Save/Load at any time, which is great! There are a couple of bugs, sometimes, which can easily be fixed by simply reloading, without losing any progress.\n\nThere isn't much to the puzzles, honestly. It's mostly about exploring the scenes, collecting items, and then using them in the right place, or combining them. It's very standard in the genre. There isn't any pixel-hunting, and you'll generally be able to solve them rather quickly.\nDuring most of the game, the areas are also fairly small, so every solution to a give puzzle is nearby, avoiding the slow walking that usually comes with these puzzles.\nUnfortunately, there are 2 (maybe) scenes that have 3 areas you can visit and in those, you'll have to walk back and forth, very slowly, until you find the right items. That was a bit frustrating to me, as are most of point n' click games, but it was nothing unbearable. Honestly, they've avoided most of it, so that's good! It will not get in the way of the story.\n\n\nWell... I think that covers it. As I can't review the story, it's hard to tell you what this game does right. The game itself is serviceable, but the way it paces the story, and gives you some freedom within it is where it shines. This is definitely not something you'll play for the puzzles or mechanics. If you enjoyed To the Moon, Primordia, Home, etc. I think you'll definitely appreciate this.\n\nThe story is quite mature, and the world has gone to hell, but the story it tells is credible, and there are certainly many aspects with which the player can identify with. Some people found it depressing, which is understandable, so know what you're getting into. I don't think it's anything shocking, but it's definitely not a light-hearted and happy story. It's a lot about what people would do if faced with risk of survival. It's not about zombies, or nuclear war. In fact, the setting is never explained, as it's there as a mere symbol/concept. And that's all I'll say about it.\n\n\nThe issue I've had with the puzzles was simply the fact that you can easily miss a very specific item, for an ambiguous purpose. What I mean by that is that several other items in your inventory could provide you with the exact same utility – but of course, the game doesn't aknowledge that, and will leave you walking in circles, re-inspecting everything. That's not something I like, of course, but changing that would probably require a whole re-design of how puzzles are done in the genre, which is far outside the scope of the review. One last thing.\n\nHow choice is handled in the different endings\nFrom what I understand, the most important choices, are the ones you make when talking to Barney. These are usually question about the state of the world that you, as a player, may not know about. It's interesting, really. It's an uninformed decision, yet, it's a valid one, since you're basically telling your son how the world is, and sometimes how people interact. And how you choose to show him, is how the ending will be presented, in a way.\nThe ending is based both on deduction done with the clues you've found (depending on the notes you find, your actions in the end may change, thus changing the ending), and also based on how you chose to see the world.\n\nAll in all, it will be very fitting to you, personally, and how you've played the game, it's very good!\nThe downside to it, is that getting several endings may be a bit laborious (since you'll have to replay big portions of the game that doesn't change much, expect for the ending), and also that the forum discussion will not be as interesting.\nTake Home, for instance. That game's discussion were based on what actually happened in the game, not just the ending. And it was great! Since in this game they're mostly about its conclusion, discussion will not be as nice.\nTo be honest, I think it's good news, if such an issue is what I throw at your game, haha!\n\nI enjoyed it a whole lot!","January 23, 2015","true","4.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

It is incredibly short for an adventure game, lasting only about three hours give or take. And that includes clicking on every object in the game and seeing the messages spewed forth. I would have loved to hear voice acting, but having played adventures since the ’80s I’m willing to overlook such an omission. Others, however, may see this as a major dealbreaker. If you can overlook this, though, you’ll find a gripping tale of loss, heartbreak, and emotions that run rampant. And the multiple endings (about four in all) show just what a person is willing to do to stay alive in a place that couldn’t care less what happens to you.\n\nhttp://www.kickstartadventure.com/home/richard-alice-review/","July 5, 2014","true","3.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

I finished it in an afternoon. The story is very adult themed with some adult language. It's a deep and engrossing story that keeps you hooked all the way to the end.\n\nThe story takes place in a world where cataclysmic cold weather has forced people to fight for food and shelter in a battle-torn world. A man, Richard, is in an underground prison cell when a new prisoner, Alice, is suddenly brought into the cell across from his. These two very different people now have all the time in the world to talk and tell each other their stories.\n\nThe game takes place mostly in flashbacks, as you relive the events that brought them to their current situations. It's a very well told story, and the puzzle elements aren't too disruptive of the story-telling process. The characters move rather slowly, which makes quite a difference, when you have to move across screens, in order to solve the puzzles. Other than that, it's a great story. Definitely worth a playthrough, if you're into that sort of thing.","April 10, 2015","true","2.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

However, the dullness of the story, with the awkward chit-chat between Richard and Alice is either like when you go on your first date, or of 6 year olds, doesn't balance out to be worth the end.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/capkinney/recommended/279260/","capkinney","Captain Kinney","http://steamcommunity.com/id/capkinney/","318 products in account","So Richard and Alice is a short point and click game which I spent just over an hour and a bit finishing. It's art is decent, the sprites are very well designed and the game looks good overall. However, the story is fairly short, just shorter than a similar game "Home" which, by the way, is £1.99. Some of the few puzzles in the game are a bit desperate to be puzzles, if you know what I mean. They are slightly far fetched. As much as the solutions make sense, and would work anyway, there are much simpler solutions not available in the game itself. So the story for the game, pushing away from the cliche zombie scenario, is the planet has frozen, and it never stops snowing, and everyone is dying, and civilization is fighting against each other to survive. It's original I suppose, but there are some descrepancies that I have with it. Firstly, no matter how much it snows, the amount of snow on the ground never rises. Secondly, I don't understand how snow could lead to an apocolypse and death. Just wear a jacket. I most likely enjoyed the game for it's plot, where a mother and her son are struggling to survive, but it's abrupt ending really irritated me. Either way, pick this up if you have a 99% off coupon for it, because it's certainly not worth nearly £5.","July 14, 2014","false","5.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/althreen/recommended/279260/","althreen","Althreen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/althreen/","515 products in account","Richard & Alice is, at its heart, a point and click style interactive story about two people brought together by fate at the end of the world.  While a new ice age threatens most of the world, Richard is a prisoner in a relatively safe-seeming underground bunker.  Early on, a new prisoner arrives in the cell across the hall.  The player controls Richard through the parts that take place in the prison and Alice during the numerous flashbacks of her story.  These flashbacks are the meat of the game and serve to show both the world outside and, slowly, the reason for her incarceration.  There are a few choices here and there as well as a few puzzles, but these are slight and quickly solved.\n\nA game like this lives and dies by its story, and that’s where Richard & Alice falls flat.  Without getting into spoilers, most of the plot twists are obvious from about ten minutes into the game when Alice enters her first flashback.  This deadens the impact of what should be highly emotional revelations late in the game.  There are also certain events that are never explained.  While this was done on purpose to heighten a sense of mystery, I found myself not caring or, at worst, thinking that those points would have made for a more interesting focus than the main story.\nRichard & Alice has a handful of alternate endings based on choices made during the game.  This would seem to give it more replayability than, say, To the Moon.  However, the endings are mostly variants on the same theme.  For a player who was more into the story than I was, I could see where this might be interesting, but the slow pace of both the story and character movement made it more of a chore than it was worth.\n\nOverall, I can’t say I regret having played Richard and Alice.  There was nothing particularly terrible about the writing and there were no noticeable bugs.  Its biggest sin is that I found it dull.  There is the core of an interesting story there and, oddly enough, I’d be interested in revisiting the world itself, I’d just rather leave both Richard and Alice in a snowdrift somewhere if I do.\n","August 4, 2014","false","2.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rhykevance/recommended/279260/","Rhykevance","Sharisad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rhykevance/","1008 products in account","Important: I am not "not recommending" this game, my review is meant to be "mixed" in it's statement, but as most should know we can only "rate up" or "rate down" when writing reviews.\n\nIt's the world end. It keeps snowing and no one knows why or what to do about it. The game starts with Richard as a child talking to his father about the snowfall, then suddenly switches into years later with things having gone wrong for a longer time. Perspective changes between Richard & Alice who meet in a prison. She is guilty of murder, and he of treason/deserting. They comfort each other as best as they can, and Alice is telling Richard about what happened to her and her son Barney before she was imprisoned, while they have to deal with an increasingly uncomfortable situation inside their prison themselves.\n\nThe game is not bad per-se, but pretty small-scaled and short. There are only a few screens/places across your adventure. Most places are heavily snowed. Alice moves slowly through the snow. Logically according to the story background. You can either see this as an ambiance-strongening thing or as something to artificially increase the duration of the game. The puzzles are down-to-earth and not too challenging, but sometimes I had to walk across the different screens several times enduring Alice's slow movement, almost considering to just save at each place and load these savegames whenever I was wanting to investigate these places again (instead of walking all the way). One place vaguely hinted at with what is still recognizeable as a road/path I didn't realize I could visit until I looked up someone mention it on the internet. Perhaps it could have been made more clearly to go that direction. But I dare to consider myself just stupid and blind on one eye at that point.\n\nYou can sometimes choose between different dialogue options. Sometimes you can exhaust all dialogue options, sometimes one out of various or a certain one forces a situation to go on. This (and the slightly irritating conclusion of the story) may give some people incentive to do another playthrough, but you can very well just load previous savegames to read it all.\n\nThere are a few strong emotional moments, though some aspects I was either irritated about or hardly understanding. Alice at one point says that her son was a strong, increasingly maturing kid. Yet I couldn't see much about that. It's the world end and he keeps singing and prancing around like it wouldn't mean much. I disliked Alice a bit for - in my opinion - shielding him too much from the harsh reality that was surrounding them. I am not sure if I would do the same if I had a child.\n\nAnother strong focus of the game aside from how people deal with bad situations is how the stories of Richard & Alice are connected. You don't get to hear much about Richard's previous doings until the very end. Some of it felt forced to me. I didn't understand some of the connections. In real-life it would be very unlikely for things to come together as they did in this game, to some point where one - or the characters - may almost start to believe in fate or god or whatever. I didn't understand the reason behind this prison to exist either. Richard gives some explanations but I didn't think I get the full picture. I didn't really unerstood how someone like Alice could get imprisoned in a world that has already gone to ♥♥♥♥ for a crime seemingly no one would prosecute. There are no visible authorities apart from some gangs, and as such this seemed somewhat constructed, artifical and hard to believe.\n\nI think there could have been more to do with this game, in a less obscured way. I think it's not a bad experience, but considering it's shortness, seemingly somewhat flawed logic and not too taxing puzzling I guess I wouldn't recommend to buy it at it's full price. Neither those who love strong stories or to explore vast worlds (I think that's where I belong to) nor those who love hard and challenging puzzles will get too much from it.\n\nMaybe I will understand a few things better when I'm reloading some certain savegames and check on some more info I missed, or by doing a second playthrough. I'm planning to. I don't want be harder on this game than what it deserves. But what I wrote is how I felt and I won't apologize for that.","July 13, 2014","false","5.8"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KiwiSalad/recommended/279260/","KiwiSalad","KiwiSalad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KiwiSalad/","572 products in account","This game showed a lot of promise. The premise for the story was unique, story driven adventure about two people trapped in a prison while endless winter raged quietly outside. It sounded fresh and interesting, I expected some well thought out dialogue, interesting puzzles and interesting stories. I was unfortunately let down.\n\nTLDR (the below paragraphs);\n\nCons: Boring, constantly diffuses it's own tension, questionable controls.\nPros: Art is nice, no game breaking glitches.\n\nUnfortunately the game is just to compressed. Each chapter is only a handful of minutes long (however long it takes you to read through the dialogue) and are incredibly short winded. You would expect a game centered on character development to have large, meaty, dialogue chunks but it does not. Not only is the dialogue short, but it's so abrupt that the ideas and feelings the characters are expressing seem very alien. They dive right into delicate subject matter, without much more than an introduction. Pacing is key to story heavy games, and it's very out of whack in Richard&Alice.\n\nNot only is the dialogue and story poorly paced, but it actively fights against it's own atmosphere. In a game that is set in the frozen collapse of humanity it's very boring. Nothing of much interest happens in Alice's narratives. IT's mostly a lot of walking around in the snow assuring your child things are alright. Anytime a potentially tense situation even threatens to rear it's head the game immediately diffuses it. As an example, the game blatantly points out people are fighting for food and shelter, killing each other for it. Yet you find a house with food abandoned, and are completely unbothered by outside forces for the duration of your stay. It's implied that people were there recently, and will likely return, but they never do (there's more to that, but that is a spoiler and still doesn't dismiss these issues). You are constantly on the edge of gang territory, but again you never see even a glimmer that they might even still be there. The constant diffusion of tension makes the game very boring, and lacking in content.\n\nLastly, this game would have benefited from some WASD controls. It's not a huge hassle to click places to walk, but clicking and then waiting idly for the character to walk is quite tedious. Even holding down a key would have helped to keep me from feeling so disconnected. I typically don't feel this way in point and click adventures, but in Richard&Alice it felt like the distances traveled were sometimes just a touch too long.\n\nOn the positive side, the art is pretty decent (but I like pixel art), and I never encountered any game breaking glitches.\n\nTLDR;\n\nCons: Boring, constantly diffuses it's own tension, questionable controls.\nPros: Art is nice, no game breaking glitches.","August 14, 2014","false","6.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The backgrounds and similar to those found on low-budget NES titles. The game just doesn't look very good, even considering the asthetic used.\n\nMost of the time, you read dialoge boxes.

Seeing as how games like these have very little in the way of gameplay, the game has to carry itself on story, and this one really didn't.\n\nThe setting is kind of interesting, the story is emotional, but there's just too much that doesn't make sense. It's hard to explain why the story isn't great without using spoilers, but there are a bunch of events that just seem shoehorned in to make the story flow and just don't make any sense in the logic of the world if you stop and think about it. The major twist for one of the charaters was baltantly obvious just from the introduction. The endings seem almost completely arbitrary based on some random actions that seem unimportant.\n\nIf you really like point and click adventure games, and the setting and bleak story seem like your thing, go for it. If you're on the fence about it, I'd skip it.","June 12, 2015","false","5.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Just cause some game pulls your heart strings doesn’t make it worth it. the message shouldn’t neglect its media both should be at the same level of context and understanding. The game is really linear, puzzles too easy, and the unbearable time consuming walking. it didn’t engross me why? the is art simple. too simple really. When your characters supposedly do some sort of action they cut to black its a clique. When they shoot a "gun", "escaping", and etc. its over used, its used even climbing up a ladder no animation, its lazy.\nThe second problem of the aesthetic, is yes I understand its minimalist, so its depressing, slow moving,\nbut honestly you could done a lot with your limitations. The few objects like the trees looked as if they were cut out from old south park episode  its disgusting then copy and paste your freaking trees over and over having a invisible wall “I shouldn't walk in the woodlands”.\nPoor delivery of your media won't help your message. The message isn’t bad, its a message that should be brought to games more often about death, survival, human condition, suffering, and etc.\nTL:DR not worth the price wait for sale I had gotten for 2$ The game is mind numbly boring its because of  the back tracking I finished it in two hours. Its message saves its self from being a browsers game.\n\n\n----------------Spoilers stop don't read-------------------------\nEverything was a story checklist nothing was off center.\n1. linear story with missing context for interesting twist.\n2. Leaving pieces of context through linear story  so its “all makes sense”\n3. The whole story is tragedy, tragic flaw discover in them self’s to answer to their sickness.\n\nThe only good parts were when Alice went crazy and even then we are left no context of her past when  and why she is talking to a dude who mostly likely didn’t existed, some sort of ghost haunting her, reflecting her conscience to whatever then justify a mercy killing, she destroy part of herself/son tragical. Richard is underdeveloped its heavy on the fact of Alice since she takes of up the majority of the game but also we have five endings which don’t make a difference in their world its all the same gray message.\n","October 17, 2014","false","2.8"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

It also felt really forced... I really didn't care if her son died or not. His dialogue and interactions with Alice were honestly my least favorite parts of the game.\n\nThe game itself is far longer than it needs to be. It is artificially extended by your character's slow walking speed and placing plot items on opposite corners of maps. That'd be fine if something happened in between but jesus christ I don't know how anybody plays the game multiple times to get all of the endings.

My initial impression is that it was a sloppy decision to make the user have to do a workaround just to get it working on full screen. The default mode is a windowed mode about 1/4 of my screen size.  In order to get it on full screen or a decent resolution, you need to locate the install files and open "winsetup.exe". This is the options. It will give you an error, telling you that it cannot find the required file. After this, you must make a copy of the game file "richardandalice.exe", then rename it to "richardandalice_steam_final.exe". Apparently, the game makers forgot to include this final steam exe in the installation files. Anyways... Once you do this, then you must reopen "winsetup.exe". This will allow you to disable windowed mode, which then gives you a full screen mode. However, full screen really just means the black border will then extend across the whole screen, and the game itself will remain the same windowed size. Apparently, if you want a decently visible full screen mode, you must need to do the advanced settings. For me, I was able to get a regular full screen mode by disabling the "Enable Side Borders" button. Hopefully, this will work for you.\n\nAfter this, I only played the game for a short bit. Pretty early one, the main characters discuss the idea of the morality/immorality of murder. It seems that the game will delve into this issue. According to the screenshots, it would not surprise me if this game questions not only moral issues, but also religious ones... though I cannot say for sure. If so, I'm not a fan.\n\nSo far, I've been disappointed by the sloppiness of the makers of this game in the options. Seriously, if you spent adequate time making a good game, I would hope you would do the same in the options needed to make it playable. I will update this review later. Hopefully, I am surprised.\n\nAnother Note- Since there is no ESRB rating, I'll make the following comment- This game contains strong profanity within the first 10-15 minutes, and likley throughout the rest of the game.","April 5, 2015","false","0.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

My initial impression is that it was a sloppy decision to make the user have to do a workaround just to get it working on full screen. The default mode is a windowed mode about 1/4 of my screen size.  In order to get it on full screen or a decent resolution, you need to locate the install files and open "winsetup.exe". This is the options. It will give you an error, telling you that it cannot find the required file. After this, you must make a copy of the game file "richardandalice.exe", then rename it to "richardandalice_steam_final.exe". Apparently, the game makers forgot to include this final steam exe in the installation files. Anyways... Once you do this, then you must reopen "winsetup.exe". This will allow you to disable windowed mode, which then gives you a full screen mode. However, full screen really just means the black border will then extend across the whole screen, and the game itself will remain the same windowed size. Apparently, if you want a decently visible full screen mode, you must need to do the advanced settings. For me, I was able to get a regular full screen mode by disabling the "Enable Side Borders" button. Hopefully, this will work for you.\n\nAfter this, I only played the game for a short bit. Pretty early one, the main characters discuss the idea of the morality/immorality of murder. It seems that the game will delve into this issue. According to the screenshots, it would not surprise me if this game questions not only moral issues, but also religious ones... though I cannot say for sure. If so, I'm not a fan.\n\nSo far, I've been disappointed by the sloppiness of the makers of this game in the options. Seriously, if you spent adequate time making a good game, I would hope you would do the same in the options needed to make it playable. I will update this review later. Hopefully, I am surprised.\n\nAnother Note- Since there is no ESRB rating, I'll make the following comment- This game contains strong profanity within the first 10-15 minutes, and likley throughout the rest of the game.","April 5, 2015","false","0.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

More than half of the game is just a set up to prove that Alice loves her son. I got that in the first flashback... no need to harp on it for pretty much the entire game. It also felt really forced... I really didn't care if her son died or not. His dialogue and interactions with Alice were honestly my least favorite parts of the game.\n\nThe game itself is far longer than it needs to be. It is artificially extended by your character's slow walking speed and placing plot items on opposite corners of maps. That'd be fine if something happened in between but jesus christ I don't know how anybody plays the game multiple times to get all of the endings. It only takes a couple of hours to finish but those are some freaking boring hours.\n\nI get what the developers were trying to do. I've just seen it done better.

This differs from most common action games where there's nuclear fallout, zombies, or some sort of war that starts deteriorating the state of humanity. In R&A, the globe is stuck in a constant state of snow, causing havoc and shortages of resources. We meet with Richard in a very fancy jail cell which are going to be future shelters for people who can afford them. The prisoners are the test subjects to ensure the shelter's safety. Richard is initially watching television and not far after, Alice is introduced in the jail cell across from him.\n\nGameplay contains majority dialogue with dashes of puzzles and minor adventuring - so if you do not like dialogue heavy games, then steer far away from this title; however, if you like story driven games and enjoy immersing yourself into the shoes of the character, then this is a title for you.\n\nThe controls are literally just point and click, nothing complex and no keyboard usage. The character's walking speeds however can be a bit frustrating at times when you aren't in the right area to solve a puzzle; fortunately Alice looks a little bit like Skrillex so at least you'll have something to chuckle about while you wait. Combining items and finding the right places to use them is the extent of the puzzles, nothing really will pick your brain too hard, however if you miss an item like I did, then you may be trekking for quite a while to discover what you need to unlock the next part of the story.\n\nThe story contains a lot of plot twists and riveting situations to keep you playing until the end. I found about 3 hours is all you need to complete it, but there are three different endings you can get, and on your additional playthroughs, you'll definitely pick up on more foreshadowing taking place. If you go into the game expecting more of an interactive story than a full on game, you will be pleasantly surprised, and I found myself shedding a tear once and even considering putting the game down because I was faced with tough decisions. I very much enjoyed the female protagonist who could stand up for her own and make her way through the frozen wasteland – she is insanely crafty and didn't let anything stand in her way.\n\nAll in all, I definitely enjoyed the title – I was guilty of looking up the additional ending I didn't unlock on YouTube because I didn't want to play through a third time. For the price of $5.99 on Steam, this is definitely worth an evening or two of your time in front of the computer and you won't regret it if you're looking for story heavy gameplay. I rate this title 8/10 as it made me feel a range of emotions, and I was riveted from beginning to end. I had to take some points off because a lot of time was spent walking when the characters should have obviously been in more of a hurry; it made parts of the game feel quite sluggish.","August 1, 2014","true","3.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Firstly, it's set in a post apocalyptic world, but not the usual dry desert style we're used to, instead it is an icy snow covered world. Secondly, it has a female protagonist who, depending on your choices, will change and grow, while avoiding any dependence on a romance for her plot. And thirdly, it's multiple endings are based around not just a singular choice near the end, but a collection of choices through out the entire game.\n\nThe game will last about 3 hours for your first play though if you don't use a guide. More play throughs I can see as lasting 2 hours or less if you speed through dialogue to get to the choices.\n\nThe audio is well done and suits the environments well.\n\nThe negatives? It can be frustrating looking for items or trying to figure out some of the puzzles on your first play through, especially if you want to simply continue the story. Some of the notes you find in the game can be hard to make out since they seem to be pictures of actual hand written notes.\n\nAll in all, I recommend it to anyone that wants a story driven point-and-click adventure with differing endings.\n\n8/10","July 15, 2014","true","2.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I don't often enjoy pure adventure games. But the strength of the setting and the character shifts kept me interested. It's not a long game, to be sure. But, I liked how it played with flashbacks and especially how it depicted an apocalypse that was a little different. It's a game that leaves you with some ambiguity at the end, and that's great. Not many do that.\n\nI will say that it has one bad puzzle that feels like a throwback to the random item combinations of earlier adventure games.

Getting around is cumbersome, and many of the puzzles devolve into a pixel-hunt clickfest over several large, empty screens that take forever to traverse. Despite this, it's actually relatively short, and while there are a number of endings available, I probably won't be playing through it three times in order to see them all, as the gameplay won't change a bit and I can't stand to walk slowly through featureless snowfields just to see five minutes of different footage. The low-res pixel graphics are ugly enough to actively harm the experience, and the writing often tends more to the casual than transcendental.\n\nOn the other hand, even here, one week after seeing the Super-Special Secret Ending, the moral ambiguity of the whole affair still haunts me. I'm left wondering if there is anything like an ideal solution to the problem presented by the story, and why such a small, cruel, sad little tale matters so much in such a big, hostile, doomed world.\n\nYou might want to get it on sale.\nYou might... you might want to start recycling.

The world is facing a second ice age, one so severe it caused society to collapse. Our title characters have safety of sorts, living in a luxurious prison which was designed as a test shelter from the weather. Over the course of the game we learn how Richard and Alice came to be neighbors by experiencing the trials Alice went through before arriving in jail.\n\nThis story is well done, and the game has five endings. Based on spoilers none of them are happy, though some are happier than others. Seeing as how society has largely collapsed this shouldn't surprise you. The two endings I achieved were well done, but not different or strong enough to make me want to replay the game to obtain the others. It didn't help that you can only fast forward conversations, not movement or “dramatic pauses”. Lastly there were no strong decision points that stood out as changing how the story would end.\n\nAnother contributing factor to why I don’t want to replay the game are the puzzles. They are straightforward tasks where you need to pick up one object to either combine with, or use on, another object. A couple were clever, but none really stood out as exciting. Add in the excessive amount of walking required for some tasks and they ended up testing my patience.\n\nAs someone who doesn't normally play this type of game, but who enjoys a good story, I recommend buying this game on sale. The game was three hours well spent, the story is worth it even if the game play is lacking.\n","August 5, 2014","true","3.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ferreteh/recommended/279260/","ferreteh","Ferreteh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ferreteh/","14 products in account","This game. This game is going to be in the top 5% of my favorite games.\n\nI'm a sucker for short stories. They're usually clean, succinct, and leave you feeling satisfied at the very least. Richard & Alice did not disappoint. The developers took a topic that has come to be of slight concern as of recently -- environmental disasters -- and crafted a sometimes suspenseful, sometimes saddening tale about a mother, a son, and a prisoner. The story progresses nicely and its three or so hours of gameplay overall make for a nice way to spend your night if you enjoy these kinds of games.\n\nNow, what I liked about it... As previously mentioned, it was a nice, quick game. The story drove itself relatively well and the small puzzles weren't particularly difficult, just occupying enough to keep you feeling involved. The point-and-click functions of the game are perfect in this aspect. I've found that some games stop themselves up with complicated puzzles and frustrating mechanics, but most of the puzzles in this game are easy to figure out and keep you thinking. The art style is perfect for the mood of the game and the pixelated graphics are just beautiful. The white noise of the snow properly maintained the cold, isolated mood most of the scenes in this game gives. The sections of suspense were played out relatively well. I feel like I don't have much to say, but once you play the game, you'll find that the upsides of the game are much more frequent and outweigh the downsides in relevance.\n\nDownsides are few but not too far between. First, her walking speed. I didn't quite mind it, but I'm a very patient guy. In most sections of the game, her trudging pace felt perfect for the mood of the story, but there were several obstructively placed walls and a certain lake you couldn't walk around the top of which occasionally frustrated me. Next, the suspenseful bits weren't too built up and generally end up just being a "What's over there?" sort of thing. Fortunately, there aren't too many of these and the very last one in Alice's telling of her events is even anticipated by the character herself, allowing for that bit of association with the character the game tended to lack. Backstory on the characters is sparse; were a few scenes to be included concerning Richard or Alice's pasts or maybe a dollar DLC with an equally lengthy backstory session to be included, I'd love to indulge, but I was left hungry for more information on the characters. The price appeared rather harrowing at first, but I was graced with a 66% off coupon by a great friend and just used up some extra change I had from earlier transactions. While the game is still worth the price even without good friends with good coupons, I'd suggest you be sure you'd enjoy it before you purchase lest you end up with something you feel you've wasted time and money on. I for one will share with friends in some way or another. Oh, and the animal corpse. It mattered only once and ended up feeling way too pointless. I was hoping it'd have something to do with the story but I was disappointed. Oh, well.\n\nI absolutely recommend this in the end. While it seems that I've said many more negative points about the game, these are outweighed by the emotions I experienced while playing. The developers did a great job and this game is one I'm certain I'll replay later on and share with as many of my friends as I can.","July 16, 2014","true","3.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I've not felt compelled to complete the other endings myself) that which ending you get is based entirely on minor in-game actions, and not on the interactions between the two main characters.  This seems like a lost opportunity, but from what I know, all the endings are reasonable conclusions to the story.

The visuals look like something from an early 90's console game but don't let that put you off.\n\nThe story and writing are excellant and touching. A few times I found myself genuinely anxious over  leaving Barney, Alice's son, behind while I forged. The game is short - you can finish it in a single sitting, but this is reflected in the price.\n\nOverall, I recommend you buy it. I would rank it alongside Papers Please! as examples of what small indie PC games are capable of.","June 18, 2014","true","3.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Not what I was expecting.\n\nIs it worth it? If you have the patience to beat the game (or at least to get the best ending "Nothing's Changed"), then yes, it is.\n\nRichard and Alice is about morals in a dystopian world. Yes, there have been many movies or games about this topic, but the difference it in how they present it and how much time is left/ time has passed until/since humanity’s downfall. In this case its weather, particularly snow that is what destroys the majority of society and from what remains come survivors and how much they will lose as humans to survive.\n\nIn that sense it is very similar to the  Walking Dead,  but  Richard and Alice cleverly tells it is story through flashbacks and current events reflecting on the tragedies that occurred during that time. This game knows how to be a quiet storyteller. There’s no voice acting and only the quiet text with subtle background music/sound effects to tell it. This lets the moral message and emotional moments hit hard without any worry of a bad vocal performance. You take in and understand the events and when you imagine how these scenarios would sound in a movie dialogue, the quality of the writing really stands out.\n\nThe main problem is the gameplay, specifically the game engine. Now  Adventure Game Studio  has been used to make some outstanding games (ex.  The Blackwell Legacy  series), but this game suffers from sluggish movement in the big open environments and it drags when you just want the next bit of quality story info (at least on my fastest computer with a high graphics card). Also, the items are too small for the mouse cursor to pick up unless you are dead on accurate. Not to mention that the item menu makes movement in a certain direction difficult. It needed a visual overhaul, but on the other hand the lack of quality visuals makes some of the more horrific scenes bearable and leaves more to the imagination. So while it served its purpose for  Owl Cave’s  first major release.\n\nOverall, this game is a beautifully emotional novelette with five endings (my favourite is listed above) wrapped in a slow-paced adventure game (by my standards after  Blackwell).  So if you can spare about three to five hours with a walkthrough guide, you will have a story that would make a good comic comparable to the  Walking Dead.  If nothing else they have the rare skill to use limited visuals tell a beautiful story. It might test your patience, but it is worth it.\n\nAnd look forward to their upcoming title  Location Services.","October 25, 2014","true","7.7"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/recommended/279260/","cyrilpanda","Cyril","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/","596 products in account","This one is.... tough, to review, at least.\nThe story is great, delving into some dark subject material and handling it well while also giving us a small cast of interesting charactersl\nThe gameplay is about as bad as it gets adventure-game wise, though. The puzzles as a whole are okay but there's a lot of having to place your cursor precisely on rather small objects and no way to boost up the resolution. Generally these are items necessary to progress, too, and I ended up stuck more than once trying to pick something up, failing to do so and thinking it wasn't something I could pick up. Chapter 8 in particular is a huge offender in this regard. This chapter in particular also suffers from insanely slow walking speeds; it's not a big issue elsewhere in the game but this chapter is the only real free-roaming one and it's just soooo sloooow. Add the tedious pixel hunting and it just left me in a bad mood, for the wrong reasons.\nI'd honestly recommend this, with a caveat; just use a walkthrough the instant you find yourself unsure of how to progress and you'll be perfectly fine. I honestly believe this improves the overall experience given this game's issues on the gameplay front; it's definitely worth your time for the story.","October 24, 2014","true","4.9"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

The characters are really interesting, and overall, it was a lot of fun.\n\nBut there are some bad things to.\n\nThe biggest bad thing is that the price to play ratio is a little off. The game is $6.00 (although I did not buy it for that, I think I got it in a humble bundle) and it only took two hours to play all the way through. Thats $3.00 an hour. I guess it is just weird because I have more than 250 hours in Just Cause 2, which only set me back $2.30. They are two completly different games, but there is still a weirds imbalance there. This would be ok if I had the desire to play the game again, but is has exactly 0 replayability, unless you want 100% of the achievments.\n\n\nThe only other major bad thing was that there are some story points I would love to see fleshed out, and I am very excited for a possable sequel, but I think they could have crammed more content into this game for the price.\n\nBut really, check this game out. It is sad, it made me, a 6'3" burly man cry all over my keyboard, and that is not something many games can do.\n\n\n\n\n\n","February 8, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Thusly,  I have to vote against it (though I don't want to). Perhaps when (-IF-) I beat it (because it's trying MY patience, too), I might find it worth the grind, as it were. For now, I must say it's too much a chore.\nHeh, yeah, yeah it is.\n\n...That might be twisted to be a triumph, as the bleakness of the in-game world is being thrust upon the player. So. Mind♥♥♥♥(?)

Again, the point of the game is the story anyway, so cheat to get to the actual game (that is, the story).\nShould I find the story worth it - after having found that guide - I might change the Negative to Positive. Will see.\nHeh, yeah... yeah we will.\n\nEDIT 2: When I wrote this, I was on the next to last level. Gripping part just happened...\nheh, yeah... yeah it did.\nKeep having to quit the game to look at that Guide, since there's no Steam Overlay while in-game, presumably because of the engine (but that's a whole other (angry) ramble).\n\nEDIT 3: There are screenshots posted of the game, so the Steam Overlay apparently does work, for some.

The one I got made me sad, but I feel like it's (one of the better/)the best ending.\nOnce more: Good story, grating game(play).\nSIGH\nI ended up liking the story, which is the core of the game.

Thus far, the majority is banter between a loving but stressed mother and an ignorant but lovable (if not a tad annoying) child.\nHeh, yeah... yeah it is.\n\nI understand and am not cold-hearted to the point of being put-off by that sort of exchange - not at all, I can dig it actually; a human "Shelter," (badger game) so to speak - but when I have to spend two minutes to get from one screen to the next *times* 3 (because backtracking), to be rewarded with more of the same ("No baby, blabla [I'm being pushed to the brink, not necessarily because of you, but you sure aren't helping. *trying to keep my patience and figure this out*].")...\n\n\nYet again, another game that seems would've been better off as a written story (disregarding the fact that gamers must have been the target audience, since the devs are/were apparently professional game journalists); as a video game, it is (sub-)par. Thusly,  I have to vote against it (though I don't want to). Perhaps when (-IF-) I beat it (because it's trying MY patience, too), I might find it worth the grind, as it were. For now, I must say it's too much a chore.\nHeh, yeah, yeah it is.\n\n...That might be twisted to be a triumph, as the bleakness of the in-game world is being thrust upon the player. So. Mind♥♥♥♥(?)

Heh, yeah, yeah I do.\n\n\nEDIT: Walkthrough from Steam Guides:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=375308346\nThere's no shame in following this, since the game can be such a slog (a lot of the puzzle solutions actually make sense, but the steps to achieve them aren't as apparent). Again, the point of the game is the story anyway, so cheat to get to the actual game (that is, the story).\nShould I find the story worth it - after having found that guide - I might change the Negative to Positive. Will see.\nHeh, yeah... yeah we will.\n\nEDIT 2: When I wrote this, I was on the next to last level. Gripping part just happened...\nheh, yeah... yeah it did.\nKeep having to quit the game to look at that Guide, since there's no Steam Overlay while in-game, presumably because of the engine (but that's a whole other (angry) ramble).\n\nEDIT 3: There are screenshots posted of the game, so the Steam Overlay apparently does work, for some.

The one I got made me sad, but I feel like it's (one of the better/)the best ending.\nOnce more: Good story, grating game(play).\nSIGH\nI ended up liking the story, which is the core of the game. I, then, feel like I must change my Not Recommended to Recommended. All of my criticisms still stand.","April 18, 2015","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's far, far from perfect, but it's well written enough to be worth a purchase.\n\nThe world has frozen over into an apocalyptic hellscape and it never stops snowing. The government struggles to maintain relevance, people starve to death on the daily, and there is very little to hope for. Richard and Alice, the titular characters, find themselves in a prison that is actually a test facility for people to shelter themselves away from the weather in. The two quickly hit it off, and with alternating stories, we learn about what happened to Alice that landed her in there and how the two plan on escaping. To say much more would be to ruin the surprises the game holds, but it;s a mostly well done story, even though there are som confusing elements by the end (that might be cleared up by seeing the other endings).\n\nThe issues lie in the puzzles and graphics. Puzzles are nothing more than key hunts, and trying everything you have on everything in the environment. They grow tedious when in the big areas later on, in aprt because of the deathly slow walking speed (with no option to speed up). The graphics, while technically not horrendous stylistically, are not fitting for the grim tone this game portrays. It references such bleak post apocalyptic fiction such as The Road, but the visuals in the game are not conducive to the similar atmosphere its going for.\n\nStill, it goes on sale regularly, and like I said, is pretty well written and intriguing. As long as you can handle some tedium, it's worth the purchase.","February 23","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

From top to bottom, start to finish, it's bleak. And the "revelations" are all clearly telegraphed from the start because we've all pretty much seen this story before. The endings, all of them, are nihilistic and the only voice of non-nihilism is clearly written by someone who has no idea how a religious person should sound. Also, the puzzles are pretty minimal (one or two per chapter) and pretty simple, mainly there to give you a sense of agency (and unlock the different endings) in between loooooooooooooooong dialogue exchanges. But is it worth playing? Yeah. I'd say it is. I enjoyed that they made Richard the one playable in the "present" and Alice the one playable in the "past." Also, the environmentalism is subtle and almost never rises to the "OMG-GUYS-GLOBAL-WARMING-IS-TOTES-REAL-AND-THE-MOST-IMMEDIATE-AND-HORRIBLE-THREAT-EVARRRRR!!!!" level of other games/movies/books, so it's worth playing just for that.\n\nBasically, buy this and play it if you feel like playing a simple, bleak visual novel about a world of perpetual winter and the inevitable decay of human society.\nDo NOT buy it or play it if you are looking for an actual game.

If you appreciate atmospheric, plot-driven games and don't mind walking around a little too slowly then this is well worth the asking price.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nYou won't struggle with many puzzles - most of Richard's involve only what is at hand in his cell - but they do require enough lateral thinking to avoid boredom and don't succumb to that old point-and-click illogic (put the rubber duck on the stick because that's what you have and voilá!).\n\nSTORY\n\nThe post-apocalptic setting is understated and believable. It makes the already well-written interactions all the more heart-wrenching. This is not a long game - took me a 3-hour run with one instance of wandering around for the last big puzzle (I forgot to check a cabinet). But the journey is instantly engrossing and uses minimalist audio and visuals to its advantage, creating a melancholic and foreboding sense throughout. The beauty in this game is implicit - it tackles some seriously dark themes without being gratuitous and asks philosophical questions without being pretentious.","May 12","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unfortunately nothing could be further from the truth. The story was predictable at best and the gameplay takes maybe the better part of an afternoon. I'm sure there are some people who will like it, but for someone who is used to games that can last 200+ hours with masterful storytelling and compelling gameplay, this title does a great deal more than fall short. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game to anyone.","April 16","false","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is not incredibly difficult to play nor is the plot hard to understand however there are a few elements that are left up to the player to interoperate for themselves. I really enjoyed this game and going back to see all the alternative endings and their grimness. This game gave me 6.5 hours of play including replaying the game to earn all achievements and a few times I left the game running and got distracted by something else in my home.","April 9","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is interesting, mature and gripping while not being gruesome or cliche in a way that I have never encoutered in a game before.\n\nAlso, the gameplay supports the plot rather than being an unnecesary distraction as in often purely plot focused games.\n\nThe graphics are what they are, but you are not going to be playing the game for the graphics.\n\nMust play.  Two thumbs up.\n\nOh, and it's short.  I finished it in 3 hours.  That's a good thing, it means there is no unnecessary fluff added to waste your time.  I wish there was a genre for story based games that one can finish in one sitting, like one can watch a movie.","June 1","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Though I dont know if its just me encountering this, but at the snow level the characters move VERY slow. Which took long to reach your destination. Not sure whether something wrong with my pc or the game, or thats just how it goes in the story (like maybe they walk through deep snow). But other than that, its a good game and remember that this game is a puzzle game. Give this a try if you like stories.","June 5","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
