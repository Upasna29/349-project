Let's see:\n\nIt's short. There will be a third episode included in the future, but even then it's around an hour and a half of gameplay. There's no replay value once you got through the game, so that's it.\n\nThe puzzles are all very self-explanatory. I guess that could count as an additional challenge and there are actually hints especially in the first episode. In the second episode there's a puzzle that really could use some more direct hints.\n\nThe art is good, the music is decent. The overall presentation is well done.\n\nStory and voice acting are okay. There's a silly twist in the second episode that the game didn't really need, but who cares much about the story in a puzzle game anyway.\n\nOverall it's not bad, but it's not worth 6 bucks. I grabbed it in a bundle and that's what I'd suggest.

Crow is a puzzle fanNice little flashgame with loads of challenging puzzles. As mentioned chapter2 and chapter3 will be released for free and maybe with some extra achievements. Sure, you can play the game for free on some flash pages. But the standalone has achievements and autosave. Also the playthrough is slightly different which you will encounter if you rely on video walkthrough guides ... The game doesn't give many hints. So the puzzles seem pretty hard and also the HOG elements. The story turns from ancient statues to a futuristic timetravel conspirancy. That's not what I've expected and quite surprising. Only problem are sometimes the quirky controls to drag a ball with your mouse through a maze of scattered monitors. If you drop it you are lost. Get it on sale or in a bundle and you'll have fun with the puzzles.","March 9","true","2.1"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","13","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/365280/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","The game follows Alexia Crow, a young girl who falls down a cave opening and ends up in a mythical realm. Tutored by a centaur who had as his former students such luminaries as Hercules and Achilles, it is Alexia's turn to demonstrate her courage and ingenuity in solving the tasks her tutor gives her, and thus become a heroine in her own right. As such the player sees the game through her eyes as she picks up various necessary objects to advance in the quest and completes a series of interesting puzzles.\n\nThe game is engaging, with phenomenal graphics and great attention to detail. This is sometimes unusual to find in a game that is created for an iPhone (the graphics are computer-quality, at least in my opinion). This is not a rinky-dink throwaway game, but one that the developers clearly spent time and thought in crafting. This type of devotion and care is refreshing.\n\nMy concern is that the game by all appearances lacks clear direction as to what exactly the player is supposed to do. I played quite a bit in preparing for this review, and I actually had to hunt down a walkthrough on YouTube to figure out what on earth I was supposed to do to begin the quest and solve the puzzles. Had I not had that, I would have been flailing around helplessly trying to figure out precisely what I was supposed to do for the first quest. Certainly I do not expect the game to solve everything for me - if I wanted that, I could watch any number of game shows passively on TV.\n\nEven given the cute intro video at the beginning which shows Alexia fall down that cave and land on the ground, I was very confused as to what was to happen next. I felt a bit bewildered. Unless I profoundly missed something, there was zero direction. I'm a fan of walkthroughs if a game has me really stumped, but I expect a little guidance and direction on what I am supposed to accomplish before I resort to such desperate efforts. A game should not be like stumbling around in the dark trying to find a light switch. This defeats the fun purpose of play. But at the same time, I suppose the lack of direction enhances the bewildering context in which Alexia finds herself, so it isn't all bad.\n\nWith all that said, I actually really enjoyed Cave of Heroes. The basic thrust is that Alexia must complete a series of puzzles to get special objects to further her progress in the quest. As she completes the puzzles, or occasionally just lying around, different trinkets appear: A fishing rod to catch fish which go into a potion and become a stone, both of which end up furthering the gameplay. A series of rhombus-shaped stones activated by being placed in matching holes on a Zeus statue, so they can be used in another puzzle. Multiple silver and gold keys, which unlock portions of yet another puzzle. And so on.\n\nThis kind of complex continuity between puzzles and aspects of the quest is wonderful, because it demonstrates not only a thoughtful storytelling but also an attention to detail and a purposefulness in gameplay that is delightfully symmetrical. Indeed, this kind of meticulous and overarching attention to usefulness, purpose, and balance only serves to highlight the seeming inconsistency with the game's frustrating lack of direction. It is as if the game is one giant puzzle, with many smaller puzzles that yield the pieces of the larger, none of which are wasted or unnecessary.\n\nPlayers should also note there is not any audible dialogue in the game - anything spoken by Alexia and any other characters appears in a kind of subtitle at the bottom or top of the screen. This was not at all a detriment to gameplay, but it was different than what I was expecting. The background music and sound effects are interesting and at times winsome but can be distracting, so I played with my phone on silent.\n\nWhile there are some potential flaws to the game, overall Alexia Crow and The Cave of Heroes is a thoughtful and delightful exercise in both attractive graphics and challenging puzzles. As we follow Alexia on her quest to become a hero, her accomplishments become ours, until all of us just might feel a bit more heroic ourselves.","November 18, 2015","true","23.1"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

When you wake up you find yourself in this cave, and there seems to be something, or someone watching you from the shadows. You will be tasked with solving puzzles scattered throughout the area, and if you can solve them, you will perhaps gain your freedom?\n\nGraphically this game isn't going to blow you away, but I do have to hand it to the developers for giving every single puzzle a different look and feel to it. You will be faced with a music challenge, a pipe-dream like challenge, a numbers puzzle, and much more.\n\nThe up and down side of the game is its length, yes there are seven rooms to enter, and each one has its own unique look and puzzles, but if you put your mind to it you can conquer Alexia Crow and the Cave of Heroes in about 45 minutes. Now some of you out there will think that this isn't worth it, but I have to say that even with the shortness of the game, it had me hooked from start to finish.\n\nI will say this about the puzzles, though, there are no instructions, you are basically thrown into each puzzle, and you're going to have to figure out how the puzzle works, or what the end game is. I don't know if this was done intentionally or not, and maybe this tactic inflates the gameplay a little bit because of the fact that there is a trial and error element to it, but in the end the puzzles were fun.\n\nThe way the game ends you have to think that there's a sequel, there has to be, there's no way that the game could end like it does, and if you want to know how the game ends, you're just going to have to play it for yourself. This game gets a 7.2 out of 10.","May 17, 2015","true","0.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Some of the mini-games are actually pretty fun, though I ocassionally had to look at a guide to tell me what my end goal was meant to be, as the game itself contains no directives. The cut-scenes really need to be skippable, and there are definitely glitches, especially with the mouse functions in relation to the background (sometimes you need to be a little off-position in order to make the function work). I will recommend it, but only as part of a bundle or good sale.

The 7th Guest is much better than this, and it's over twenty years old.\n\nThe number one reason why you shouldn't buy Alexia Crow, realistically, is that it has been released on several websites for free (legitimate sites, not pirate sites,) so there's no good reason to pay for it unless you really want to support the devs (or are desperate for Steam Achievements and Trading Cards.)\n\nBeyond that, the game has several glaring flaws; the voice acting is poor and the writing (or translation, more likely) is terrible.  The story is incoherent.  The puzzles tend to the sort where figuring out what you're being asked to do is frequently harder than actually doing it.  The interface is annoying for many reasons, most notably because it uses tight target zones, but changes the mouse pointer to the object you're using, with no indication of the active point; if you use pointer icons without a clear active point, you need liberal target zones to make up for it.  A late-game puzzle involving a maze revealed only in fragments was particularly frustrating because confusion over the active point and general glitchiness caused my icon to get repeatedly stuck in walls.\n\nAlexia Crow isn't all bad.  The art is very nice, and some of the puzzles were quite fun.  On the whole, though, this is a notably substandard puzzle game, and you can easily find much better ones.","December 2, 2015","false","2.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

Not because of complicated puzzles, but because of the poor implementation of the cursor/mouse pointer versus where click actions occur.\n\nThis doesn't seem to fit there or similar was driving me nutz, along with any other complaints or commetns about scenery when my cursor as right over what I wanted to click and activate, or place an item on.  Why, because the cursor is off compared to what it shows on the screen and it seems to be different in different rooms/areas.\n\nThen of course there was the beauty of a bug that the first game I started I literally skipped 95% of Chapter 1.\nBrand new fresh install to let it run for cards.\nStart game.\nok, no menu, game drops you right into play where you left off, in this case new games.\nFalling scene, check.\nNext scene I am listening to Chiron talk about how a hero needs to achieve or prove themself or somesuch, and then Chapter 2.  That was literally the first minute or so playing.\nI complete 2 puzzles (notice the achivements out of order).\nQuit to Main Menu.\nClick Continue Game, and the whole game crashes.\nStart Game\nContinue Game\nNow I am back at the beginning of Chapter 1 with the Gold Chapter 2 key I unlocked during the 2 puzzles there.\nRight at the very first puzzle, exactly where I should have beenafter the falling scene.\nScreenshot:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=566547909\n\nSo I decided to start it over and finish it.  Hit a few smaller bugs along the way, but by far was the display position of the cursor versus click.  In some puzzles multiple items would sometimes click while click their buttons (as though you somehow pressed 2 buttons even though they were more than far enough seperated there is no physical way to even place the mouse above both.\n\nJust a buggy mess with a weak story, and mediocre puzzles.\n\n","December 1, 2015","false","4.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

This is *only* Chapter One - at no place in the description or title is that made clear. If I had known, I'd have waited for a full (or fuller, anyway) version. Perhaps I should have dug deeper, but it is the norm to post that info in the description.\n\nAs far as the game itself: the art is very good. That's about all I can say positive.\n\nThe puzzles are very simple; however, you are often left hanging with inadequate input. While I don't expect to be hand-held, basic info should be available (there is at least one puzzle where you can work it and work it - but nothing happens unless you "activate" the pieces - which is not indicated at all, not even a simple "Hmm, this fits but something's missing"). Frustrating. Nor is there any guide or indication that you can do things like combine pieces in your inventory; again, basic information.\n\nThe storyline is less than gripping, the scripting poor and the voice acting annoying. You cannot skip through it either, as far as I was able to tell.\n\nI generally enjoy this type of game as a light, relaxing activity. Between the lack of information, simplicity of the puzzles and lack of fair description I have to downvote this, despite the very professional art.
