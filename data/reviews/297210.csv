It's a good game to play for a few minutes, assuming of course you can force yourself to shut it down; it's rather addictive.\n\nYou can only carry two items at a time, which means you will sometimes have to go back for items. You need a key to get to the next level, but be careful when you pick a key up, as it takes up one of the two valuable item slots.\n\nThere's no option to change the graphics or sound. The graphics is in a vertical column, as you see on the screenshots above. The sound is always on and at full volume, which is a pain if you want to watch TV at the same time.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who wants a fun and simple roguelike game.\n\nI would not recommend this game to anyone who wants a highly detailed game full of roleplaying and complexity.","May 5, 2014","true","5.9"," 45 of 54 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","45","54","0","0"

There are two halves of the game, the top and bottom. The lower half shows a 2D side view of you and everything around you. The top shows the mini map. This map is what you'll really be paying attention to. You move north, south, east and west by moving up, down, left and right. This is why I say you'll be paying attention tot he map, because the bottom of the screen is a 2D side view of the action. Right and left on the side view isn't always east and west on the map. So if you're pushing left looking at the bottom of the screen and you can't head west on the map, you won't go anywhere. The object of the game is to find the key and get to the locked door. There are a certain amount of randomly generated mazes to get through, where you then see your statistics and get an ending. Its not about the finish though, its about the journey. With the randomly generated mazes, every play through is different. Every death means a new dungeon to explore.\n\nThe map is a maze of hallways, with no rooms. On the map you see the halls, walls, your location, enemies in red, items in dark blue, rutabagas in sky blue, treasures in yellow and sleeping enemies are dark red. You can see these things a certain distance away from you so you can plan to avoid things accordingly. Some enemies will move, but treasures, rutabagas and items will not. Your map starts out dark, but the more you explore, the more of the map gets uncovered.\n\nThese enemies are easy, you don't fight them so much as bump into them with you both dealing damage to one another. To fight, just walk in their direction on the map. Its that easy. You can stand in front of a foe without them attacking. There are a variety of enemies with different habits. Purple slimes will blot out some of your explored map. Skeletons will rise up after you walk by them. Ghosts will steal your items. Wizards will chase after you. Cycloptic floating heads are asleep in the dark until you light up an area near them, then they'll wake. There are of course standard attackers like paroling spiders, goblins and the more difficult fat red trolls. You can run from most enemies without them following you.\n\nWhen you start the game, you select from three classes. The knight starts with a health potion and can use a charge attack. The thief can see and disarm traps, and has a teleport potion to almost completely avoid combat. The wizard can transmute an item and has a powerful fireball. This fireball plows through enemies on your map. Even enemies that you're not fighting, the fireball travels straight down the hallway destroying lesser foes in its path. Its effective, to make up for the wizard's low attack power. The only problem is that the fireball counts as an item and can only get used once before its gone.\n\nYou can get XP from defeating enemies and lighting torches in order to level up and make combat easier. The torches lit are worth far more XP than enemies you defeat. After the first level, its difficult to increase XP, so it becomes worthless in my opinion.\n\nThere are no weapons or armor. You have what you have from start to finish, so this isn't a traditional dungeon crawler. Less micro management makes it easier for casual players. Instead, it is the items that mix up the game. You can hold two items at a time, to use them, hit the number keys. Potions refill your health. Flares light up a small part of the map while killing nearby enemies and turning distant ones into rutabagas. Even if an enemy walks into the light, they will transform. A teleport potion will let you transport yourself to anywhere on the mini map in the upper half of the screen, but not the full map. The key counts as an item, so it takes up a slot in your inventory to make things more interesting. There are several items and objects littered through a maze. Dare I say almost an item for every enemy depending on the map.\n\nAlong the way through each maze, you'll find all these items, but you'll also find torches, lights or lanterns. Whatever they are, when you light them up, the map around the area brightens up. Much like a flare, but a larger size. So active enemies turn into rutabagas, cycloptic heads wake up and traps now show up on your map. That's right, Famaze has traps, so if you spend your time completely avoiding enemies and running from them, eventually, you'll find hidden traps. These traps only damage you and without the light from a stationary torch or a flare, you won't see them.\n\nThe entire story revolves around the rutabagas, the mad king has turned them all into monsters, and you need to turn them back. So the real object is to hit lights, that turn the enemies into rutabagas and then collect them. These rutabegas give you health for touching them, so it leads me to believe, you're actually eating them. Eating the things you're trying to save. It is probably a lot easier to transport them in your stomach than to carry them in a sack. It doesn't matter though, it all goes to statistics at the end of each level and the end of each game.\n\nAs for the treasures, they are nothing more than a score at the end of each level and I'm sure add up to more at the end of each play through. You'll find standard treasures and treasure chests. Sometimes the chests contain more gold for your score, other times its spikes. Risk and reward. There are even health floor tiles that refill your energy just once and teleportation tiles that send you to a different part of the map. These all blend together to make the game more interesting and engaging beyond what I find in deeper less casual dungeon crawlers.\n\nAlso in the maze are seven collectable artifacts. I'm not sure if all seven are in each play through, but I was able to find the first two on my first play through. Then I found the rest in following play throughs. I think it is a way to extend the life of what is an hour long game. On top of that, you unlock a harder difficulty after completing the default quest.\n\nBetween each level you'll see a random charming scene over your treasure and rutabaga score. Its a nice addition to what could have just been a score screen.\n\nThe lower half has a great 8-bit art style. Charming sprites without much animation. As the game progresses and you go maze to maze, the backgrounds and music both change. New enemies get thrown in, so I feel like there's a good sense of progression. The music itself is good and fits into a dark chip tune feel of wandering through a dungeon. Yet, the music doesn't loop it just stops until you find the key. Maybe less is more, but I wish the music would loop or something.\n\nNow for the downsides. The game is vertical since it has a top and bottom half. I feel like its meant for a smart phone and not a computer screen. Double clicking the game will make it full screen windowed, but it does nothing for the resolution. Its just a black screen with the game in the center. The game has no mouse or native controller support. I'd much rather play the game with a controller especially with how simple it is.\n\nWith everything said, I can recommend it. Maybe its not for hardcore dungeon crawler fans since it feels more like a strategy, but people that want an easy little pick up and play game that strays from the norm. While its a charming, easy to play game, I don't think there's enough fun here to keep me in it for that long. It would be the perfect game for a phone.","February 16, 2015","true","2.6"," 25 of 29 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","25","29","2","0"

You will often need to find keys to unlock doors to other areas. Keys are usually scattered in places hard to reach, guarded by enemies or traps.\nThere are 3 classes you can choose from when starting the game: Wizard, Thief or Knight. The Wizard specialises in spell-casting and thus is a good choice for ranged combat. The Thief has a chance of disabling traps so you can easily reach a place without having to take the long way. The Knight has the most HP and deals most damage.\nThe combat is turn-based. If you're playing as the warrior, don't expect to not be hit at your turn. Also, everytime you move a space, so do the enemies, making your plan route different.\n\nPros: +old-school dungeon crawler;\n+exploration of the map;\n+the classes and leveling up system;\n+usage of items;\n\nCons:+could've been more complex, in terms of gameplay;\n+it gets repetitive after a short while;\n\nPersonal rating: 70/100 - Good","May 8, 2015","true","2.3"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

Originally made for phones and the browser FAMAZE was a really fun little rogue-like that was perfect if you only had 5  minutes or so. The goal of FAMAZE is to find a key and to get to the end of the dungeon. In most rogue-likes, when you move, the monsters move too but in FAMAZE most monsters are stationary. They just block your way. Attacking monsters causes you and your foe to lose 1hitpoint. In order to stay alive you need potions that refill your life. The catch however is that you only have 2 inventory slots. This mechanic leads to alot of strategic thinking. FAMAZE also has a rather interesting lightning mechanic. If the light touches an enemy it turns into an healing item. This is an easy way of defeating your foes. So FAMAZE is a fun little rogue-like that is perfect to play while downloading a huge game or so ;D. If you want a strategic rogue-like that is really complex look somewhere else(ToME is perfect if you're looking for that;D) Simple but fun!","November 2, 2014","true","2.0"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

This attack reloads very slowly after killing enemies\n- rogue - has a chance to disarm traps - seems useful enough\n- mage - probably has some special ability, but I couldn't unlock it\n\nYou have like five items in this game:\n- potion - restores all of character's HP\n- key - allows descent into next level\n- teleport - allows one time teleport to any square in the minimap region\n- flare - provides some light and turns enemies into turnips (?) that you can eat for 1 HP each\n- fireball - shoots some damage dealing line that can turn into corridors and leaves some light behing\n- some coins and treasure chests that add coins which do nothing\n\nYou can encounter astonishing tiles along your journey such as:\n- crumbling ones that deal 2 HP damage when you fall into them!\n- healing tiles that heal all of your HP!\n- spike tiles that deal 1 HP damage, terrific!\n- normal tiles that you just walk on untill finishing this game!\n- beacon - well, this one is pretty useful as it provides light to quite large area thus turning enemies into turnips\n\nSo on, so forth...\n\nCombat is very simple - you stand against some enemy that won't even chase you if you back up (except ghosts and probably skeleton mages) and you deal 1 damage to each other. Player character has some chance to deal critical 2 damage to enemy. That's all. Using an item does not count as an action, thus if you have 1 HP you can use your potion and continue fight. Believe me, it get's pretty boring pretty fast. You better play Desktop Dungeons, at least there are some unlockables.\n\nOverall this is a pretty shallow game. Pixelart graphics are nice, true, but this won't fend off long agains boredom that stabs you in the back like some rogue in Dungeons & Dragons after 15 minutes into the game.\n\nBut still, this one is free, go and check it out for yourself.\n\nEDIT:\nOkay, after some thoughts this game is not that bad. It's ok if you like to play some light games that doesn't require much time to dig into. I just can't recommend this one in comparison to other games that are out there, but still if I would give a dollar for this one I wouldn't regret that.\n\nSurprisingly, playing a rogue in a roguelike game is... interesting.\n\nEDIT 2:\nThis is indeed a fun little game. Just playing knight and mage makes it is so dull. Try a rogue instead.\n\nReally, when you play as a Knight it takes like about forever to charge your smite attack and you need to actually beat many monsters to gain levels. Usually you also trigger many traps and lose many hp. Playing as a mage you have one useless ability that seems to transform teleport orbs into fireball item only when you find one particular Transmute Tile where you can transmute those items. Also, mage levels up really slowly and gets into like every traps on the way. This game is somewhat not balanced at all. If you want to have a nice time just pick up rogue, he'll level very fast and has ability to disarm traps which gets really useful pretty fast. Alternatively, you can also try playing as a knight but this may be a bit tedious. Mage imo is unplayable at all.\n\nThis game is also a bit buggy, if you want some proof then take a look at discussions page.\n\n----------\nFor anyone interested in joining in on completing your own backlog; check it out here - http://steamcommunity.com/groups/completingthebacklog/discussions/5/530645446320364338/","January 12","false","1.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","8"

I was able to complete the game on normal and collect most of the artifacts in around 45 minutes, so the game is pretty short, after you beat normal mode however you unlock a harder difficulty, so the game could last you quite a few hours. The game feels alot like a rougelike game so you probably wont get tired of the game a second time around if it held your attention long enough to complete it once.  Famaze is free on Steam now, so I hope if it looks interesting to you you will take the time to try it, its simple and small, and if you like retro games you're sure to think its pretty neat.","September 7, 2014","true","3.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Why is the resolution locked like an idiot recording video on an iPhone? Don't you people realize that nearly everyone has a 16:9 or 16:10 monitor these days, not 9:16. On top of that the game felt pretty pointless. Wander around a maze killing spiders and turnips. The 2D perspective makes no sense at all either. The maze goes N,S, E, & W yet my little idiot just hops back and fourth. Due to direction changes in the map not properly matching with the "action window" I often found myself attacking a goblin that was in the opposite direction my character was facing. This is just a sloppy game that should be avoided at all costs. I got it in a bundle for $1 and that was still too much money.","May 15, 2014","false","0.1"," 16 of 30 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","16","30","0","1"

Given this, I am willing to recommend this game for the few hours that it may be enjoyable. The business tactics for this release on Steam may have been gritty, but at least it concludes well (other than the people who bought this game on relase, in the groupees bundle, or was gifted this by that person on your friends list that hates you).  I am satisfied now, 5/10.\n\n\n\nOLD REVIEW: http://i.imgur.com/Ii1Fy82.png\nQuick answer: do not buy this.\nIt is a minimalistic maze roguelike, which sounds like a pretty good idea, but ends up lacking in so many areas:\n\n+ The hard difficulty is challenging\n+ It is a good "I have nothing to do" game\n+ Traps, units, and items are decently balanced\n+ Decent soundtrack\n\n= Minimalistic\n= It is fun for the first few hours\n= It is indeed roguelike by every means\n= Uses their own assets, but they have also sold them, so the game ends up looking generic.\n\n- Repetitive\n- Lacks options. How so? No options at all. Also, it has no key rebindings.\n- It is nearly impossible to lose on the easier of the two difficulties and requires a lot of time and luck to get through the harder difficulty\n- One mistake on hard can easily make you restart the entire maze\n- Way overpriced for what it is and can currently be played for free (w/ ads, etc.) at http://jayisgames.com/games/famaze/  (Currently this game has NO differences from the free version other than slightly larger display and no distractions around the screen.)\n- Edit: http://www.agame.com/game/famaze\n- Too simplistic\n- It is basically a glorified maze with roguelike elements that turns into more of a perfectionist puzzle than a roguelike.\n\nIn conclusion, it is in your best interest to stay away from this game. If you are really interested in a luck based challenge, a strategy intensive puzzle game, or an extremely easy roguelike with RPG as minimal as the style, than this game can be decent. Overall, it is lacking so much to be justified as anything over $1  or your equivalent of nearly free. While I personally like the minimalistic style this game chose to go, I do not feel like it offers much in comparison to other roguelikes of the same price.","May 5, 2014","true","4.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","17"

You move up, down, left, and right to navigate a map in the upper screen. In the lower screen you will be given a representation of the characters and the environment. You can attack enemies by walking into them. There are a small variety of items to find in the mazes. You can hold two items at a time, but they will respawn upon use or loss so you'll never be out of supplies. There are traps that make the mazes hard to navigate safely, as well as monsters to fight. You can gain XP through that or lighting large torches. Shedding light on most enemies will turn them into items for bonus points. Gold is also around for points. Some enemies, however, will be awakened when you shine light upon them. There are lots of litle ins and outs of the game depending on the situation you get into with the randomness, but it's overall incredibly simple. Your main goal is simply to find keys and use them to open up the next level.\n\nHonestly, I only played a bit of this one and it got boring and repetitive pretty fast. It's a time waster. It's easy, casual, simple, and fun in short bursts. However, in the sea of games on Steam, it doesn't have enough to stand out, nor is it more worthy of your time than many other games. The only reason I can recommend it is that it's free. It's not a bad game, but much too simplistic and repetitive for my taste. The visual style is neat, the concept is okay, and the music is cool, but it's just not enough to keep me coming back for more. Famaze gets a 3 out of 10 for being a neat little free game that can kill some time, but ultimately isn't worth wasting your time on unless you truly have that much time to waste.

I don't feel glad I supported this by buying it on initial release on steam. I feel like I've been kicked in the teeth by Oryx.\n\n------------------------------------------\nI really want to mark this neutral- half way between recommend yes and recommend no.\n\nFirst of all, this game apparently used to be free on the web at the official web site, but now it links to steam instead when you click to play. The game is available here though:\n\nhttp://jayisgames.com/games/famaze/\n\n...and playing it will give you the best idea of what it's like.\n\nThe good parts are that this is a charming, simple game with pixel art sprites, nice chiptune style music and a polished feel.\n\nThe bad parts are the complete lack of options which means you have to play in a window approximately the height of your desktop (at least on my 1920x1080) and a third of the width. You can't redefine the keys, which is unforgivable. For the record keys are cursor up left down right, 1 and 2 to use objects, m for map, space for pickup, q to quit and esc to cancel.\n\nIt's also a bit weird that Oryx are using their own sprite set which has been sold to a lot of developers, making their own game look generic in the graphics department. It's also a bit disappointing that this, unlike the other games using the sprites, isn't a true roguelike because you're not moving freely about on a 2d grid with monsters chasing you and so on. If anything this is a "1.5D" roguelike game.","May 5, 2014","false","1.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","3"

Content-wise, this game has about 15 levels in linear order.  Not worlds- levels, and this number includes the five or six bonus levels that have about 20 aquares in them.  There are only three characters all available from the start.  It does not fit a computer screen properly.  Each real level will take, at most, ten minutes to complete, and can each be completed in under a minute.  The game has branching paths to choose between that the player must go down in separate playthroughs to collect pieces of a magis stone, which is close to artificial lengthening.\nThis game has a few bugs, including that when the spacebar has multiple functions it decides what it wants to do, like activating a trap that will harm the player instead of going through a door, or going through a door instead of using a special attack.  A bigger bug makes the character disappear when they collect the last magic gem shard, making it impossible to see the true ending.  In hard mode the game may become literally impossible to beat, which will force you to resart the game (although it won't take long to get back to where you were or get stuck again).  The music has been hailed all around, as it is made by the critically acclaimed artist Disasterpeace and it is available to purchase for the exact price of $4.99.\n\nThe Game Itself (oppinion):\nThe presentation could have been entirely redone for full screen by putting the maze-screen and action screen on the left and right and making them bigger, and it seems lazy to only allow you to see what monsters and items are when they are two squares away from you, when the screen also lets you see three sqaures.  The developers for sure knew about these and probably other bugs I haven't discovered, and were even told about them, but left them in when they could "break the game".  That the game is so short is a problem, especially since these levels seem so simple to design.  The gameplay is also very simple (explore until you find a key, then find an exit while hitting monsters to subtract on hit point from each of your health bars, and use items+plus your characters special ability to stay ahead of the game), even though the variation of monsters and items is perfect for this very short experience and the three characters are each interesting and well-balanced, the general strategy will always be the same (only use items when necessary, save health for traps, and locate the way out quickly but try to last long and gain points/xp).  Some will like the small variations (like myself), while others will be totally bored.  The soundtrack is truly wonderful, I have not seen a professional review that does not complement it, and I bought it separately, but this game is only on par with a very good flash game or a good phone game, and does not include the soundtrack for a download, so it should cost less than the music.  Also, the music does not repeat in most cases, which is a wonderful artistic choice, but then you are left in silence until the key is found or you decide to go to the next level, which could have at least been filled with some simple beats from the other incredibly skilled musician on the team, Roger Reckahdam Hicks.  The sound effects could at least have more variety, each character makes the same noise when the hit a monster and move.\n\nOverall, this game is very fun and a great concept, but short, incomplete, bugged and flawed.  Because an all star cast, a dream team, put it together it is horrrible and unexpected that it ended up like this.  I voted for it on greenlight thinking that if success on Steam was in the developers vision they would go back to work and make this game great, but as soon as they got in they released this title before even putting steam acheivements in it, then raised its price by 4.99 and deleted the free version!  This is just plain old exploitation of Greenlight and the people of steam, along with a dishonorable rejection of making art as opposed to making a profit, however small- this is an offront to the romance of independant development.\n\nThe History:\nThose three indie titans got together to make this game way back in the 200Xs.  They were going to make it for phones, hence the strange shape of the game and arrangement of screens.  They carried on for quite a while, but the game was generating less and less interest from the public, no income, and the developers had many other projects looking more hopeful (the Famaze soundtrack was created  at the same time when Disasterpeace made the Fez soundtrack).  It was put into Greenlight, but wasn't being voted for, so it was put into stasis.  Eventually (2013) the game was released in flash for free on Oryx's website, where I found it and loved it, and Disasterpeace put the soundtrack out for sale.  That would have been a very sad end to Famaze, that it would die with a wimper on Oryx's page, but then Steam started Greenlighting 100 and 50 titles at a time!  Was this it, was Famaze going to find some fans in the Steam Userbase?  Would the developers sit down together and expand it to something wonderful like it easily could become?  Absolutely not!  It was made downloadable, the price was raised, and it was dropped into the Steam marketplace with all the pomp of dropping a banana peel into the trash!  The developers cast aside all of their honor and integrity as artists when they put this unfinished product here, and insulted every one of their fans by expecting them to put money into it when it is just a flash game- they insulted you!  Even if the game itself sounds great, when used like this it is soiled and turned entirely into garbage.\n\nF2P Update:  All of the developers were confronted at the time this was written, but none commented back or replied.  I do believe that I might have been slighty harsh in my delivery, and even made an apolagy, but until we can hear how it ended up how it was from the mouth(s) of whoever published this, it is right for us to be upset about what happened.  It was pointed out to me that this game was put into a bundle a few days after it was released on steam, and was recently in a bundle just before becoming free (which means some were cheated out of their cash, again, but it is a step in the right direction).\n\nAs said in my apolagy, all people go back on their honor, so the publishers should only be treated as if they made a mistake.\n\nNo matter what has happened in the past, even recently bundling right before going F2P, the game is free now, as it should be.  This controversy should be over.  On the other hand, I have not heard from any of the big three, so we have no idea if this was not thought through entirely, or a cold hearted bussiness plan.\n\nLastly, because there has been no dialogue, we cannot know if the publishers have learned from this, or would do it again.  We need to have a public statement to clear all of this up.  A youtube video could be made, and the comments turned off, if you do not want to see hundreds of people insult you (as is the case with the internet).  I truly hope that I have been fair.","June 10, 2015","false","2.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"
