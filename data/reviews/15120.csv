I know I don't have much time played on PC, but on my XBox, I can say with confidence I have well over 1,000 hours into the game. I play it with a friend almost daily. When you have a good co-op partner, this is the only game you'll ever need. Terrorist Hunt is where all my time is spent, next to Outfitting. I'm constantly changing up my dude, finding ways to make him look unique- and it's just damn fun. It's also only $10 when it's not even on sale, and it's simply a solid co-op shooter that holds up even today! What are you waiting for?\n\nPros:\n+ Fully Customizable character (and Camo, at Elite Rank)\n+ Solid Single Player Campaign (In the sense that it's fun, the story's pretty meh.)\n+Fantastic Co-op to be played in Terrorist Hunt\n+More mature audience, less screaming kids\n+Hilarious Terrorist Dialogue\n+No uPlay!\n+A level with the MLG logo plastered everywhere\n+Multiplayer (Co-op, not the adversarial stuff) is kind of still alive\nCons:\n-No Subtitles. Maybe I haven't been looking in the right spot, but I can't seem to find an option for them. I barely understand what's being said over the comms.\n-Sometimes Terrorists are XxMLGxX420swagl0rdz, and will completely rek you (Or they'll charge at you... backwards.)\n-Matchmaking can be super laggy (I also have 3rd world Canadian internet, and I usually wind up playing with people in Europe which doesn't help.)\n-Doritos & Dew Double EXP doesn't work on this title\n-Difficulty spikes during the campaign (IMO- it could just be that I didn't play it as much as the Terrorist Hunt missions)\n\nOverall: Not bad, ♥♥♥-holes, not bad. 9/10\n*edit: Added the lack of uPlay as a pro, extra notes in the pros/cons, misc fixes.","January 7, 2015","true","50.1"," 94 of 106 people (89%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","89","94","106","19","6"

This game isn't your typical CoD style rambo shooter. It uses cover mechanics, gadgets and tactical witts to move forward. It allows you to play the game the way you want to play it. So before i continue, Yes this game's graphics are a bit meshy at times. They dont look as solid as a typical CoD or battlefield style game, but i enjoy the mechanics a lot more.\n\nSingle Player- A story driven singleplayer that not only allows you to customize your character but also allows you to approach different methods to approaching your enemies. The story is decent and also has game modes such as terrorist hunt. This game allows you to sharpen your skills before you play multiplayer games. (Keep in mind people online may play like idiots). So as i continue this review the single player has a lot to offer and it's a very interesting game but theres a bonus to the story.\n\nStory/Coop- The story has a coop play that allows you and one friend to play the game and both of you will gather experience to level up. Essentially you can play the game single player, Coop or multiplayer and always gather experience to level your character.\n\nMultiplayer- tactical gameplay with firm maps. You always got to work together.\n\noverall this game is basically like a game you want to play. A game with tactics, and fun gameplay that you can play with your friends and enjoy.","September 7, 2014","true","0.7"," 72 of 82 people (88%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","88","72","82","6","4"

So I'll touch on Vegas 2 first for fans of the series/genre, then as its own game.\n\nSo first, for other fans: you're best off looking elsewhere, Vegas is no better a tactical shooter than Modern Warfare 2, "featuring" such inconveniences as mobs of enemies, regenerating health, and a crosshair that can't be dismissed. The planning aspect is gone entirely, and the only real strategy you'll see is queueing up endless "stack up" orders on the occasional larger-than-average corridor. It's a game that pays only lip service to its forebears and altogether a bitter coda for a once great series. One is best off looking elsewhere for a proper tactical shooter.\n\nBut, assuming for a moment that the game were to exist in a vacuum, with no relation to the series, then the prognosis is a whole lot more optimistic. Vegas 2 is a rather robust title with a tremendous offering of content for fans of arcade FPS. While nothing particular about the game really jumps out, it's far greater than the sum of its parts. The shooting is punchy, the weapons feel real, the locales are sufficiently varied to never feel repetitive, and your enemies are truly a force to be reckoned with. And it's the AI that really shines. Each enemy feels individual, intelligent, and dangerous; they suppress, they flank, they aggress when they have the numerical advantage, and defend when they lack it. They're not perfect, and actually seem to be artificially gimped to make them easier, but you won't find many PVE shooters with the same caliber of opponent. The actual gameplay is largely preferential, but can be roughly generalized as a slower-paced Call of Duty with fewer enemies.\n\nHowever, unlike Call of Duty it's a pretty robust offering of content, featuring a rather lengthy campaign (with co-op!), numerous bonus missions (co-op again!), and a lengthy--if very grindy--levelling and unlock system to keep you grinding that treadmill forever. So, a note on each. The campaign features those wacky terrorists making another attack on the biggest casinos in Vegas, and Team Rainbow is called in to clean up the mess. It's full of cheese and stupidity, being just about the campiest thing since the 50-Cent games. The plot is further hamstrung by the occasional attempts at seriousness, notably as a few VERY contrived "tearjerkers". But! It's only mildly distracting, and serves as a fine vehicle to take the player to a variety of wonderful casinos full of wonderfully dangerous prey. As for the bonus missions, they take the form of numerous big non-linear maps full of bad terrorists with guns for you to hunt down. They call it "Terrorist Hunt", why, I'll never know. The maps have a high degree of replayability, and are just good mindless fun all around, especially with a buddy. Finally is the unlock system. It's all remarkably fleshed out, allowing you to create a new operative, customize their guns, armor, clothing, camouflage, gender, face, and turn-ons/turn-offs. It's a very novel system, combining the best elements of GI Joe and Barbie Dream House so much so that customizing your vanity avatar is something of a game in-and-of-itself. By locking everything behind an XP wall, it gives you a great incentive to keep playing and something to look forward to as you progress. A lot of the weapons are locked behind that wall however, so if you're not a fan of Skinner Boxes you're gonna have a bad time.\n\nSo in summary, Vegas 2 is a terrible Rainbow Six, but a pretty good and very content-rich FPS. But make no mistake, it's no more a tactical shooter than Unreal Tournament so don't expect the second coming of Rogue Spear.\n\nP.S. Play on Realistic difficulty and if you're obsessive about firearms get this mod.","February 16, 2015","true","39.6"," 67 of 88 people (76%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","76","67","88","11","0"

This will be a bit of a TL;DR review, so if you don't want to read the next paragraph or so, just buy this game. If you DO, well, here we go.\n\nStory:\nThe plot of this game, for the time, was pretty inovative. You have the ability to lead a small team of 3 through various levels, taking out enemies. You can breach doors, rappel into windows, and more. It's something to experience, but nothing too special.\nVersus:\nThe servers are too ♥♥♥♥ for things like this at the moment.\n\nThe Main Event: Terrorist Hunt.\nTerrorist finds you and up to 3 other people against a horde of between 25-50 terrorist, each out to kill you. The team must use tactical strategies to effectivly complete each of the maps, which differ between them.  If you try to just run out and Rambo it, you won't last long. You can customize your loadout in the middle of a match, rather than having to wait until you either quit or do it beforehand. You can experiment with different weapons for each map to find your comfort zone. Each enemy will react differently. Some will just wander around aimlessly, having terrible accuracy. Others will literally kill you the INSTANT you run through a door. It gets you paranoid, which means you employ new tactics.\n\nThis game is going on sale for like 1 doller during the summer sale, so buy a copy for yourself and a few friends. It's an old classic, and it's hella fun.\n\n9.5/10 would run through a door and instantly get my ♥♥♥♥ evaporated again.","June 9, 2015","true","29.0"," 46 of 55 people (84%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","84","46","55","9","0"

Good memories.\n\nThe good:\n\nGraphics are a later Unreal Engine so they aren't bad.\nHighly customizable loadout that is made available to you as you progress through the levels with experience.\nA very detailed upgrade model based on experience and types of shots made. You gain experience points based on the shot you make, be it close quarter, long-range, assault mode, etc. Each shot gains you XP points for a specific type of ladder and each ladder (CQB, assaulter, marksman) has its own rewards and perks.\nVery good cover, concealment, shoot and peek controls. You can crouch or stand by a corner or behind cover, peek out and shoot, or peek out with zoom in function already selected, shoot, peek and go back to your zoomed view on your weapon without having to zoom in simply because you went into cover. Very useful when shooting multiple enemies from one location.\nYou can choose an array of weapons, armour and equipment.\nWhen you have the gameplay mechanics downpat, it becomes super fun breaching and using different tactics when clearing rooms.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nThe AI is at times inept. They take forever sometimes to follow through with commands once you give them.\nThe AI cannot throw a grenade competently. Frequently I've given the command for my squad to throw a grenade at a precise location, only to watch it bounce off a wall and land back at my squad and wipe everyone out. At certain times they will refuse to even throw one when requested.\nAI does not auto-heal itself. I have to backtrack and tell one AI squad member to heal another. Duh.\n\n\nVery fun as you're able to plan your approach differently - either going in assault-mode or silent.\nOverall it's a fun game well-intentioned hampered by some AI problems.\nWorth the download if it's on sale.\n\n7.5/10","March 22, 2015","true","82.8"," 25 of 30 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","25","30","0","0"

Let's put it this way: I f*cking love this game!\n\nSince I was a kid, I've always wanted to become a part of a SWAT-unit. This game really makes me feel like I'm a part of that. With solid gameplay, great gun mechanics yet questionable A.I, it still stands out and can really hold up to triple-A games today. To be quite honest, I think this will be a better game than the new Raindbow Six game coming out soon.\n\nBelow is a list of things I liked/disliked about the game:\n\n+ Great level design.\n+ Customisation is better than any other AAA game on the market right now.\n+ Playing with friends is really fun and enjoyable, since it requires a lot of teamwork.\n+ Solid gameplay mechanics (such as the cover system, which is where you'll spend most of your time in the game).\n+ The friendly A.I is REALLY good.\n+ Hilarious dialogue from time to time.\n+ Gunplay feels awesome, and really responsive/realistic.\n\n- The enemy A.I is utterly ♥♥♥♥, even on the "Realistic" difficulty setting.\n- Lack of an FOV slider.\n- The plot has bigger holes than a hooker from L.A.\n- The friendly A.I is REALLY good.\n- Pretty complicated to join your friend(s) so that you can play with them.\n- No proper tutorial. I know it's an old game, but even back in 2008 tutorial levels were a standard.\n\nThis is probably one of my favourite first person shooters to date (yes, even up at the top with Counter-Strike)!\n\nI'd recommend this game to anyone looking for a good time. 8.5/10 from me :)","July 3, 2015","true","14.1"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","18","19","3","0"

It also ends up stopping my heart everytime I turn a corner and get ♥♥♥♥♥ by Shotgun Man because I'm too focused\n\n+Custom character, clothing colors, and mix and match armor pieces, and later on custom camo colors too\n\n+Armor matters, you can take a valuable hit or two at the cost of general movement speed, or run around in a tanktop and khakis and hope you don't get obliterated\n\n+Hella sexy near death effects, you don't hemorrhage from your eyes like in CoD, your vision gets impossibly bright and blurred, simulating how it feels to get shot and have a rib broken, like you're about to faint\n\n+Perfect amount of difficulty, the terrorists may have brain cancer which affects their basic judgement, but they still react almost instantly and perfectly aim bot your slow ♥♥♥. On Realistic (the hardest), the terrorists just hit you more often than on those other, pathetic, weakling difficulties\n\n+HUGE assortment of weapons, and while they have more or less the same stats (the in- game stats are lying), different iron sights, recoil patterns, reloads, etc. make each weapon unique, so every gun is viable\n\n+There are still plenty of people who are clinging to Terrorist Hunt, and in the two games I've played of PvP, we almost got a full server going\n\n+Realistic gunplay, you can't iron sight/ reflex sight the whole game away from across the map and scopes can make CQC uncomfortable.\n\n+Its easy and fast to customize weapons, offered every post- game death screen\n\n+Leveling system, for better or for worse, I like it because it always gives you a new goal to work towards. Give up on getting Elite 99 though. ACES is a pretty nice system, which basically keeps track of how many Headshots/Precision kills you make, CQC kills you make, and Explosive/Breaching kills you make.\n\n+Ragdolls interact with one another, I have a screenshot of terrorist bodies piled on top of each other\n\n+Excellent map design, there isn't an all out long range map without some major CQC area. There may be some near- exclusive CQC maps, but Terrorists enjoy instantly reacting to your prescence and instantly killing you, literally.\n\n+Lengthy Campaign, with a nice story. TH and MP share maps, so they're both equally good ways to learn the dozen or so maps\n\nCons?\n\n-That one weapon gun firing glitch where the gun continues playing its firing sound FOREVER, until game ends, pretty sure there's a fix though\n\n-Terrorist AI could be smarter, but being swarmed by up to 8 murdering machines has kept me and my friends entertained for this long. Mostly me\n\n-Terrorist Hunt is pretty Co op focused, so you kind of need at least 1 other player to stand a chance against 50 brain dead ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in Murdertown\n\n-Can get repetitive, especially after Campaign is done\n\n\n\n\nOverall I give this a 9/10, loses points for being repetitive after you reach enough play time to go Elite a few levels (I'm Elite 6 or something)\n\nBuy it you loser, you won't regret it.

Don't mind some of the aspects like health regen and whatnot, the game is amazing. It comes with the standard 3-4 shots to die feeling so you still gotta watch out. Campaign is really fun and epic especially if you have a friend by your side. Same goes for Terrorist Hunt. My girlfriend teamkilled me more than she killed the terrorists. The game will keep\nyou up and running for a lot of time. It has a great level of customization as well as a feature where you can put your own face as the character's face. The amount of armor and weapons you can unlock is astounding. It's even better than some RPG games, to be honest. IGN would say 'Skyrim with guns!'. The game gets really cheap on discounts and it is a shame not to buy a copy of it. As for the multiplayer, it is pretty much RIP. But you can still kick some ♥♥♥ in the two player campaign and the four player Terrorist Hunt mode. It's old but gold. Snipers have the feature to blindfire. Do I gotta say more?!\nIf you have some money left, spend it on Vegas 2. You will not regret a single second in the game. There is so much fun and content to keep you going.

I love guns, customizations, decorations, and doing that to my personal camoflage and armor. I spent hours enjoying tons of customization options and tweaking sexy sleek looks along with trying many different weapons. I'd say the unique feature of vegas 2 is the overwhelming amount of customization in being good looking. I know many people won't really find that to be a selling point but for me vegas 2 was an amazing game in that aspect.\n\nGameplay wise, it's an okay-ish third person shooter. Very fun to play co-op and multiplayer with other people. I have had a lot of fun playing this with friends. I wouldn't hesitate buying this if you want to look for a fun game to blast some terrorists along with your friends. Make sure you find the mod online to increase the amount of co-op players limit on campaign co-op, terrorist hunt, and the tweak that changes the amount of terrorists spawning in a particular area so that you won't get swarmed.

A bit outdated but still very solid.  One big problem.  Ubisoft never fixed the sound loop glitch.  I've put in about 10 hours of play time and it basically loops machinegun fire constantly if someone dies while firing until I die or dissconnect and reconnect.  It is a client side issue and does not seem to happen if I host.   Very annoying.  The issue seems to crop up the most on the campaign co-op, occasionally on terrorist hunt.  I hunted the steam forums and google for a solution and there isn't one.  Apparently this has been an issue since the first Vegas and Ubisoft simply never bothered to fix it on PC.  Because of this I can not recommend what would otherwise be a great game.

There are two things that make this game so much fun. T-Hunt (preferably with friends, realistic and high enemy density) and Customization.\n\nT-Hunt is pretty self-explanatory, there are a set number of terrorists per map and you'll have to hunt them all down. Sometimes it's easier said than done because most of those terrorists are insanely accurate and deadly especially the infamous SPAS-12 wielding terrorists.\n\nOne of the greatest parts of this game is that there's a good amount of customization options for your character. You will gain XP from every kill and then eventually you'll start to gain more ranks and that means more options to customize your character with different armor, clothing and camos. Customizing your character is addicting as hell and it's kinda nice to see what kind of operators other players have made. There are of course those who run with their vomit colored tanktops looking like they are running towards the nearest convenience store getting their latest fix of their favourite energy drink. But hey, who am I to judge? If that's the character you want to create then so be it.\n\nYou'll also unlock more weapons and slight XP boosts through the system called "A.C.E.S" this game has. There are three A.C.E.S trees called Marksman, CQB and Assault. The level cap for each tree is 100 but the weapon unlocks stop at 20, after that it's just an XP boost after another. You'll gain these A.C.E.S points for killing terrorists with different ways, for example, killing someone with a headshot or a kill from long range gains you some Marksman points while killing someone from close range or killing someone while blindfiring gains you some CQB points. Assault points are mostly explosives related and shooting through the walls.\n\nAFAIK the PC version is mostly the same except for a few extra bugs, the most notorious one being the sound loop bug which makes the game pretty much unplayable for off-host players. Luckily there's a fix that reduces the frequency of it happening which can be found here: https://steamcommunity.com/app/15120/discussions/0/616189106755568359/\n\nOverall it's a pretty good "tactical" shooter that still holds up. It's a shame that almost none of the recent games have this kind of customization as this game has. It's a great game to have some casual fun with friends while playing T-Hunt and also getting killed by terrorists with shotguns.\n\nAIM FOR THE HEAD","January 4","true","31.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","6","6","4","0"

I am sure now that Ubisoft has gone super mainstream, as in, every game has to be call of duty for them, we won't see another like this. It is unfortunate, but I guess that's what game companies want.\n\nGet your friends and play this shooter, after you have gone through the story mode, do the terrorist hunts. There is no better FPS tactical shooter on the market you can do this with. The controls handle very well, and this game is very challenging where you mostly get one shot. Sometimes two... but you better get your kill!\n\nThe only thing I don't like is sometimes the AI is pretty kamikaze with no consideration for their own life. They just run in your face to cheapshot you. Kind of ridiculous since you are holding cover aware of your own life, the AI is not and could care less if it dies to get you.

And it is amazing. Unlike the Call of Duty these kids are playing these days this game requires "skill" or talent at especially at higher difficulties. This game is rather hard at parts on normal even more so towards the end of the game.\n\nYou can command 2 allies or you can simply set them to auto-fire and follow you. You can set them up for door breaches and more tasks, tell them to use silencers and go passive (Shoot when shot at) If you prefer stealth. They are interesting charactors but not enough to where you care about them like a pet dog. More like a hamster.\n\nThe story is great and fun, it is a fantastic story for a fantastic game.\n\nThis game is highly customizable with many cosmetic options and gun attachments. To unlock the cosmetics you must progress in the game and get experiance for doing different tasks and level up your main level, you must get to certain levels on certain skills to unlock guns aswel. Some people might not like this but It gives a feel of progression that I love.\n\nThis game has more modes than story gving it replayability, co-op, muliplayer and terrorist hunt. The first 2 are simple, play with other people with or against them. But the 3rd, you are thrown in an area told to kill a certain number of terrorists with, if you are playing with friends, some extra lives if so chosen. Single player isn't much harder as you can have commandable allies from the story mode.

Multiplayer is competitive and fun, with lots of customization and modification for both weapons and your character.  The progression system is lengthy, but fair.  Good weapons are available at the starting level, so there's no worries about teams having an unfair advantage due to equipment.  The Terrorist Hunt mode is a smidge bland, but that's usually the case when it comes to NPC stomping but it does the job.  Overall I'd give Vegas 2 an 8.5/10.\n\n","December 1, 2015","true","2.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

So much fun to play around with.\nIn which game can you actually affect how your character will look like in-game ?\nWhat ? Call of Duty Blackops ?

That said, Vegas 2 is a good example of how tactical shooters can work in the mainstream market. There's a solid array of equipment, the rank-up system is surprisingly well-done, and the game mechanics generally work pretty well. Unfortunately, it's too easy (when you can lone wolf the entire game without much consequence, you have a problem), too short, the story sucks, and the multiplayer's completely broken on PC.

There's no actual spoilers, the spoiler format is just so it's easier to read bullet points in pros and cons if you want a quick breakdown. Also I can't compare to other rainbox six titles as I haven't played any others for more than a few mins.\n\nIt's a pretty good shooter, but the story is WAYYYYYYYY too short, I'm already past it on hardest difficulty and I have several afk hours + I didn't realise about things like silencers till about halfway through, (I think it does tell you about it in the first level but I played that then got distracted for a while by other games soooooo...my fault)\n\nI do think the story is worth the sale price but not the full price so I will recommend it based off that.\n\nIn terms of controls it's not bad, Cover being on mouse is unusual but works fine in practice.\n\nThe high points of the game are the tactical elements, planning out the breaching of rooms, using thermal scans and snake cam to plan your route, blowing a door apart with a breach grenade if there are people directly behind it etc.\n\nPros:\nDecent challenge\nControl of team is nice though they are a little too abusable.\nShooting controls are nice but mostly you will want to avoid trading fire as much as possible.\nGood range of weapons and gadgets, nothing crazy just an ok selection of normal weapons.\n\nCons:\nAwful AI,  I mean they try to cover and flank sometimes which is nice but you can kill a whole room with a silencer and they ignore the bodies and if you flash a bullet past their head as they duck into cover they come back out at the same spot for you to just blast it off gratefully and then there's the smoke interaction which is possibly the most tragic bit of all.\nMagical enemy spawns  make it annoying to plan routes, also ruins immersion and makes it frustrating when someone appears in a spot you had checked very carefully just seconds before, (I'm not talking about people roping in, I mean literal sudden appearences\nSilly Last "boss" scene.\nStory mode is way too short, it has like 4-6 hours total of play even at a casual enough pace with several deaths.\n","February 23","true","11.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The FOV is locked to a sub-70 angle, (and Ubisoft's excuse is quite literally saying "we cannot be arsed") meaning that a lot of the time, you're going to be killed by something you didn't see, and the controls, while fortunately rebindable, are hard to use at best and unmanagable at worst. The optimization and slew of resolutions and aspect ratios are done well enough to nearly excuse the lack of an in-depth options menu and slightly disruptive online interface. I recommend this game on the grounds that if you can get past the bad, the game is solid enough to warrant continued play. Much in the same sense that a flan is still good, if you can get past it being in the bottom of a bin.","April 11, 2014","true","15.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was ready to jump into it, with my customized soldier who looked like he would not get out of it alive, and my 2 (not 3) teammates. The first mission was awesome, I was sneaking around, silently taking out enemy upon enemy to get to my objective. Then my squadmate was an idiot and decided to shoot everything, almost killing the hostages, but killing the negociator. The first mission was amazing, and it had me going, but after that, it went down a very dark road. Eventually it just felt like I was thrown into hundreds of enemies that I was ordered to kill. No tactics, just enemies. It was a Call of Duty campaign thrown into Rainbow 6 which I do not appreciate.

It's arcade-ish yet realistic to an extend and keeps you entertained most of the time. Story mode is fun and can be played with a friend, Terrorist Hunt mode is very enjoyable and you can be played with 4 people (16 if modded). Can't say I enjoy the Versus mode much because it's simply full of the usual "online shooter game ♥♥♥♥♥♥s" and 5 year olds, but to be honest, not as much as the more popular games of this genre. The customisation in this game is amazing and there's an option for choosing gender, weapon mods, clothings and armour.\n\nAll that said, the game has an awful sound bug that rarely occurs randomly, constant gunfire, aside from that and the bots with perfect but fallible aim everything is pretty much perfect in this game. They don't make games like this anymore. Ubisoft and Punkbuster aren't supporting the game anymore, but It's cheap and very fun, and still has a great friendly multiplayer community, well worth the money.","May 23, 2012","true","49.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","6"

The campaign does have a good amount of missions and content, but the actual story overall is not that great.\nThere is also Terrorist Hunt which can be played with 3 other players maximum.\nAs you rank up, you can further customize your operator with new pieces of camouflage, armor, tactical goggles, balaclavas, masks and more. Which you can spend a good amount of time just customizing your character.\nOn a side note, the actual character faces are not that great, but with the PC version of this game, with a webcam you can actually use your own face (or use a picture of something else like a bear) for your character's face.\nBut the game also does have some problems with audio which I have experimented on with the PC version and the one ported to Xbox 1, there is errors when you might shoot a terrorist/NPC while they're shooting and the gunshots will not stop until you reach a new scene/finish the terrorist hunt mission, it can get very annoying and confusing as all you hear is that gunshots over mostly everything else.\nI have also tested playing this on PC with a  Logitech Gamepad F310, and a Xbox 1 controller with connected in with a adapter. Neither of them worked (and to check so I could rule out user error I checked the options and tried to enable the ''Xbox 360 controller'' and also tried using the controllers on different games like GTA 5 in which they did work.)\nOverall, I would recommend this game definitely at least if it was 50% off if you just wanted to play something new for a little.","January 9","true","10.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While it can be done (and several do so rather fondly and have a blast), this games true potential shines with the Multi-player and character creation system.\n\nOffering 7 chapters of campaign mayhem with anywhere from three to six checkpoints, there's easily 72+ hours of gameplay if you simply try to rush through it without fully trying to enjoy the game.\n\nThe Terrorist Hunt mode offers a chance to futher hone your skills and tactics for both Campaign and Online Versus modes. AI can vary from downright predictable, to completely unforgiving and brutal. Even on the lowest difficulty, the AI can stiff offer a variety of commentary and skill to throw down against the player. Again, trust not the AI paired up with you, BRING A FRIEND. Playing on Hunt? BRING THREE FRIENDS. The higher you set the scale, the harder this game can mess with you.\n\nThe ability to semi-realistically alter your loadouts armor-wise is amazing. The better the armor, the heavier it is, and the slower your character can move, while taking more hits (aside from the ever annoying headshot or grenade). With multiple options for gear and weaponry, you'll be hard pressed to find someone that looks exactly alike. Word to the wise, try to pick a bright color, the enemy tends to stick to darker camo options, and you don't want to be confused for an enemy at long distances.\n\nLike any game, it does have it's quirks and glitches. Getting hit from long range with a shotgun (and it being a headshot) is downright evil. The bots also seem to have a better grasp on bullet penetration and just how to throw grenades. They also tend to spawn in random places during the Terrorist Hunts, so any areas you might have cleared, are not 100% clear. Always check your six.\n\n\nDefinitely more than one way to complete the game, and with the option to replay quite literally from any checkpoint in the campaign, there is always something to do. If nothing else, there's always room for improvement, and even the veterans can be caught off-guard by a trick you develop. This game does deliver.","February 5, 2014","true","18.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It hasn't aged amazingly but it's really all we have left besides SWAT 4, nothing seems to have replaced it in the genre which is a shame.

The story is pretty bad and the dialogue is at some points laughable(not synched correctly in conversations, awful lines)  but the squadplay is pretty good. Camo and armor make the game pretty fun by adding progression. The gunplay is good but hasn't aged amazingly well, but RSV 1 and 2 will always have a spot in my heart","November 23, 2014","true","6.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The game has a good story that is simple to follow keeping in mind is not the best story telling ever but it gets to the point. Gameplay is good with good story missions and level progression. Since game has been out for some time and its old I didnt get an opportunity to try multiplayer. Now for the stuff I found wrong: the AI is horrible Mike and Jung (your computer teamates) quite often i wont say always performed some of the worst room clearing(CQB) i have ever seen in video games. After they would clear a room and say "all clear" I would enter the room just to walk in to a whole mag clip from a single enemy that i would say is probably about 4 feet away from them. I blinked I was dead. The voice actings of Bishop(main character you play as) sometimes would feel forced, and same with a few other npcs in the game. Last would be typical annoying bugs here and there were you would reach a checkpoint and something is suppose to happen but it doesn't. My overall rating for this game from a scale of 1 to 10 is a 6.5, and considering the price for the game i suggest giving it a download.","November 17, 2014","true","30.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Arloste/recommended/15120/","Arloste","Urban Hyena♥","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Arloste/","101 products in account","Rainbow Six: Vegas 2 is a game I'm very passionate about, from wonderful memories playing with my dearest of  friends, to the excitement I feel whenever I rank up and unlock more equipment. Speaking of equipment, this game offers a fairly complex  loadout customization system, probably one of the most indepth systems I've ever seen in a videogame to date, though the actual avatar creator leaves much to be desired from. (Only allowing you to chose a pre-made set of skins, gender, and war paint) Gear isn't the only thing to unlock either, weapons are another aspect to look forward to, the game offers a selection from light support guns, sniper rifles, assault/battle rifles, handguns, and sub-machine guns, not to mention grenades as well as other explosive devices of varying type, making replayability quite fun, getting to create a new gear set, and try out a new weapon. The campaign can be seen as quite straightforward, though my nostalgia blinded eyes believe it's something quite special, I'll leave the decision up to you whether it's one of a kind, or generic. Besides the main story campaign, there's a fairly run of the mill multiplayer, though with the benefit of you getting to use your custom geared loadout, and a mode called 'terrorist hunt' which is a blast to play with your buddies or even just solo, as you select a map, and clear out a set number of enemy combatants, this mode is great for grinding! The soundtrack is enjoyable to listen to, the enemy A.I is somewhat competent, the guns (dependant on which you use) sound meaty and powerful, there's also fairly realistic gameplay, even if you chose the beefiest of armour, a few well placed shots from really any weapon is going to send to you to the grave, creating adrenaline filled tense moments, which could end up with a single bullet to your head, or the enemy's. All in all, I strongly recommend this game, it's a lot of fun, and should keep you busy for a while!\n\nI hope my review can help you decide whether or not this is the game for you! ^-^","April 2, 2015","true","38.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

BUT I CAN'T STOP PLAYING IT! Despite all of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, and the glitches, this game is one of the few games that has this level of character customization. As you play through the game, no matter what you're doing, you're ranking up what the game calls "A.C.E.S.", which unlocks new weapons and equipment, and ranking up your overall level unlocks new clothing and armor items for your character, and even a bunch of real-world accurate camouflage patterns. Eventually you'll even unlock the ability to create your own custom camouflage patterns, so that you can look like a pink and purple tanktop wearing ♥♥♥♥♥♥, or spiderman! And that's not all! There's a feature that allows you to use a webcam to capture your face (or even something that isn't your face) and impose it over your character's face! The possibilities are endless!  Not only that, but this game has a campaign that you can play fully co-operatively with a friend, and terrorist hunt mode, a returning mode from previous Rainbow Six games, which allows you and up to three buddies to take on multiplayer maps that are swarming with terrorists, the goal obviously being to eliminate them all. The big downfalls of this game are the glitchy, awful AI, and the terrible advarsarial/pvp multiplayer gameplay. The AI can sometimes see and shoot you through a solid wall if they manage to somehow stick the muzzle of their gun through it, and the pvp multiplayer is just plain trash to be honest. If any of the fun things I've mentioned in this review sound like your cup of tea, and you feel like you can dismiss or ignore the glaring AI issues in the game, then I highly recommend this game. If you're a stickler for well polished games, however, this one is not for you. The glitches are impossible to overlook, and sometimes they're just plain awful to have to put up with. This game would've been actually good if the AI wasn't such a botched mess. I can barely recommend it to anyone, but there is some fun to be had. Buy it on sale for cheap.","June 7, 2015","true","18.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","2"

Co-op, as always, really relies on playing with a friend or friends, never look for someone else online, they will either give you the verbal birch stick if you don't let them get every kill; or will just act like spastics, throwing nades everywhere and never using suppressors or non lethal grenades. But the fact that you can do things that you wouldnt be able to do with your AI partners; like stacking up, throwing a grenade, and not getting stuck in the door, makes co-op a very nice feature, and of course, should be in a game like this, oh yeah, terrorist hunt is cool as well.\nThe single-player is not that fun and feels like you aren't being SUPAR TACTICEL unless you go looking for alternate paths and breaching ports (and you should).\nFor multiplayer, if you want to play consistently, as in not having to pray for 2 players in a match in iceland, is to join a clan; but still, they have pulled off tactical, non twitch multiplayer very well, maybe not the best in the series from what I have heard and played a little bit, but still very nice.\n\n8.7/10 Loved it, frustrated me at times and made me feel that certain things needed you to know that they were coming to survive them in the campaign, such as certain enemy rappellers and ambushes, as well as that it is a bit short albeit with replay value, (no armour/nades lone wolf p99 w/o silencer stealth run go!) but still, very very nice.","August 6, 2014","true","24.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The cover system works well enough, weapon choice is realistic, character customization is present and there are pleny of camo, armor, and clothing choices to make your rainbow agent yours.  Terrorist hunt is fun to play threw with friends.  Over all this game is a wonderful and worth playing if your into the tom clancy franchise, you just have to overlook the occasional bug.  As of Jan 2015 I was unable to play online, probably due to the servers being shut down but it could have been somehting with my computer, so be warry if your expecting an active online community cause theres sadly not (atleast that I could find).\n\nBug Issues\nI noticed recently while playing over a VPN (hamatchi) that there was still a sound bug that kept causing machine gun fire to loop that used to happened every so often back when it was first released on the xbox 360.\n\nFor 2008, a 10/10.\nFor 2015, ill give it a solid 8/10 if your a fan of the seires.\nand at least a 6.9/10 if your new to it.","March 7, 2015","true","7.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The gameplay was entertaining, the AI was decent (mostly), loads of weapons and customization options for your operative which actually had a purpose for the most part.\n\nThe big selling point for me was Coop terrorist hunt and story mode while it didn't really change up the story much having its much more fun playing it though with a friend as you discuss tactics and gun down bad guys and having teammates is more or less essenital on terrorist hunt on the maxium density and difficulty\n\nMind you the game is far from perfect as the story well easy to follow isn't anything really special and once you unlock all the gear and rank up to elite there isn't all that much incentive to carry on.\n\nI can't say very much about the muliplayer side of it as I've never played it though from what I've seen with my bro playing it it has a good amount of gamemodes (DM, TDM, capture the flag, etc) but it seemes people prefer to run an gun rather then use tactics and games tend to turn into snipe fests on more open maps but if your into that sorta thing then you'll probably enjoy it\n\nOverall I'd wait for a sale and pick it up then\n\nOh and the PC controls are a bit awakward so I'd use a controller if you can","December 18, 2013","true","23.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Even the story mode is multiplayer up to 3 people so id have to give this game a 8.5 / 10 for team based FPS games. Also love the hide and take cover options to stick to walls and cover, lol reminds me of gears of war. ** When running first time start up with this game about half way through it asks you to install PunkBuster anit cheat services, of course you can get it and it doesnt really mess anything up, but i havent seen 1 online match using it so everyone just clicks cancel and you can still play without getting PunkBuster and online so no worries :D**\n\nP.S.

A job well done by Ubi. This isnt a typical run & gun FPS as other Ubi's title as we known as the most arguable FPS due to its own comunity atitude. Team coop & coordination is essential. Plan your move & use your tech right will save your team & progress through the game. The story mode is a 2 player coop-able.  It's more fun and challenging to do Realistic mode with friends. You lead 2 friendly ai & 1 hooman friend for you to command. Then, there's Terrorist Hunt mode which is more friendly & less-tactical play (cant use support gear such spycam, thermal map).\n\n[+] PRO's\n• No UPlay. definitly a YAY factor on Ubi games\n• the best avatar customization system for FPS. ever. i repeat....EVER !\n• coordination based FPS game. No run & gun\n• gun feel real, gun changing animation is as slow as real. dont reload until is safe or depleted. no lollygagin on this one\n• char lumbering feel real. you cant run as fast if you lumbered with gear that much. So be wathcfull for granade icons LoL :D\n• nice covering system. be friend with wall, be gooood friends\n• AI isnt great but good enough, even smarter than most of C*D player\n• good online & matchmaking system\n\n[-] CONS\n• The infamous gun loop bug.

It's not terrible, but it has one flaw that breaks the game completely, friendly AI. This would not be an issue if you didn't need your two teammates to actually complete missions because of either story parts, or so many enemies you can't do it alone. Your teammates are pretty much crack shots with the minds of 6 year olds. There are times you have to tell them 20 times to rappel a wall in an empty room, Jung goes down every two seconds because he doesn't understand that if you're being shot, you take cover, they try to go two at a time through doors, and they easily manage to either clear a room full of 5 guys easy, then proceed to fail when they breach a wall fighting two. The AI is a hit or miss, and it's a miss 93% of the time. On the other hand, the enemy AI will headshot you at 1000m, rush you, frag you, and act like an actual fighting force, while you're two teammates act like they have mental deficiencies. Oh, and this is a minor story issue, but no one carries more than one type of breaching charge, which will later hurt them when you reach Act 3, but due to spoilers I'll leave what happens out. A note to Rainbow though, there's other breaching devices besides C4, such as battery rams, crowbars, and smaller, non-lethal ones that don't blow up the whole door, which were around by the time of this game's release and was most likely in use by all the regular SOF operators in the TC Universe. It's not a bad game, but the friendly AI is so bad I can't reccomend it, because they put so much need for you to have your AI and use them that it ruins the experience.","April 7, 2015","false","8.3"," 13 of 26 people (50%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","50","13","26","6","0"

Despite what anyone says.\nThere is a Bug with the Sound. I just played it for 2 hours, online Coop and let me tell you - This Game is BROKEN.\nI have heard that it happens in Multiplayer, both versus and Terrorist Hunt Coop...\n\n- Machine gun firing like crazy, caused when a Player or AI is killed while firing. It only happens when you don't host - apparently - and Completely Ruins the Sound of the game for the entire match.\n\nWhats Worse, Ubisoft has known about this glitch, and has had it reported by players. They give canned answers about updating Drivers or whatever - and have not issued a fix. the Game has been OUT on PC for More than 5 YEARS. Yet... Ubi wants money so bad that they wont work on anything but current projects? Or AT LEAST - Come Clean about the Issue and say its a Unfixable Bug?!\n\nPlay this Gem on a Console. You will still get the bug like I did years ago - but RARELY. This Happened in Every Game I was just In, For 2 HOURS. You will be able to Enjoy the robust unlocking system and unique tactical gameplay... I am sad to report that for PC, this game is not even close to what it is on console.","June 25, 2015","false","2.2"," 17 of 34 people (50%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","50","17","34","5","3"

Changing port settings; alterting your Firewall; using Hamachi; trying other software; and/or getting lucky. You can now play with one other person, maybe.\n\nTrying to play with strangers: "Cannot Connect to Host" for 95% of the time you attempt to connect to someones game. No-one ever joined my game, so they probably got the same error. You can eventually join someones game, for one match. When they try to switch the level => "Cannot Connect to Host."\n\nIssue 2:\nThe machine gun sound glitch. As a Host I didn't experience this, but when I joined my friends game by the graces of god, I experienced the sound glitch within minutes. At this point, you turn off your sound or go insane.\n\n\nI didn't get the game for Singleplayer, but that experience is up in the air. I've spent more of my time attempting to connect to lobbies and getting re-directed to the main menu over and over instead of playing the game, so I'd suggest being cautious should you consider purchasing.","November 26, 2015","false","4.3"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","4","9","2","0"

In this game, I rarely found myself in a pinch and often wondered why I even had a handgun, I never needed it with all the ammo I had.\n\nTurning up the difficulty didn't change this, it just meant I died more often, but dying didn't really feel like a failure in this game.\n\nIt's a very decent game, and even many years after release, I found it good enough that I could enjoy playing it, but it's meant for Co-op and co-op only, on high difficulty.\n\nI'd still pick a game like SWAT 4 over this one, but that might not be a fair comparison.\n\nAll in all, a good game.","September 29, 2014","true","4.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Tim kita sendiri terdiri dari 3 orang, dengan kata lain kita punya 2 kawan yang ikut serta dalam tim yang kita pimpin.\n\nGame ini menarik menurut ane, banyak fitur yang membuat game ini menjadi lebih seru.\nJujur ane belum banyak mainin game Tom Clancy, Splinter Cell adalah satu satunya game Tom Clancy yang pernah ane mainkan selama ini.\n\nBalik lagi ke Rainbow Six Vegas 2,\n\n[] SULIT +\n\nYa, game ini menurut ane sulit untuk dimainkan. Pasalnya, ane main mode normal aja udah kewalahan. Entah emang ane yang payah atau apa, tapi game ini beneran susah!! Tapi itu yang bikin game ini tambah seru\n\n[] Command +\-\n\n+ Di dalam game ini kita bisa memerintah pasukan kita seperti mengepung, menjebak, dan lain sebagainya. Ini bener -     bener asik!! Karena kita bisa berbagi tugas dengan kawan, dan kita juga bisa tag enemy yang kita prioritaskan.\n\n- Terkadang, ane kesel dengan bot temen se tim kita. Ada suatu waktu disaat ane menyuruh salah satu dari mereka untuk melempar Grenade ke arah musuh, ternyata dia malah melempar tepat di depan tempat ane berlindung. Untung ga mati.\n\n[] Karakter +\n\nKarakter utama di dalam game ini bisa kita ubah - ubah, dari wajah, hingga kaki. Begitu juga dengan aksesoris seperti pada kepala, mata, dan lain - lain. Semua itu membuat karakter kita punya ciri khas tersendiri, asik kan ?\n\nJadi secara keseluruhan, game ini menarik dan menurut ane patut untuk dibeli. kalian ga bakalan nyesel kok beli game ini.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dsmithisghey/recommended/15120/","dsmithisghey",".dSmitH^","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dsmithisghey/","46 products in account","This game is simply amazing. Me and my best friend used to play the original for 360 all the time just for the all-mighty T-HUNT feature.\n\nNOTE: My review is based off of my MULTIPLAYER experience, I only toyed around with the SP for a level or two on the 360 version and immediately left to go T-Hunt.\n\nNow let's get to the real reason people buy R6V, Terrorist Hunt;\nTerrorist Hunting is when a set group of terrorists (the amount is also changed by the difficulty along with their skill level) is scattered around a small map and your job is to neutralize all of them without dying. Rules can differ by how you choose to approach the set-up. If you play it offline, you can play with bot teammates, or as a lone-wolf. However, if you choose to play as a lonewolf, when you die, you die and you start back at the beginning. If you play with teammates, you can revive each other. On the online version, servers usually allowed 1 to 2 respawns with a 2-4 player team from normal to very hard settings (the amount of respawns depends on the difficulty settings). You get XP for neutralizing the enemy and winning the round. Other than playing the story co-operatively online, this is about as much teamwork as you can get on an online shooter besides playing a competitive match on CS:GO.\n\nYou can rank up your character and unlock new weapons, attachments, gear, and articles of clothing like the last edition. In my opinion not much has changed from the last R6V other than the storyline, and some of the maps (although the great Calypso Casino is still there).\n\nIf you choose to play the game strictly for the campaign, it has favorable ratings, but the game is definitely hinted at for it's T-Hunt feature. The usual DM, TDM, etc. are also availible but not often played as much as T-Hunt.\n\nIf you are able to pick this game up cheap, please do. The player base is great, but very small and shrinking heavily, and a lot of the times you are paired with someone from a country thousands of miles away. However, do not for you can T-Hunt offline as well although it might feel a little less rewarding as you're unable to show off.\n\nAll in all I would give the game a 8.9/10.\nDEFINITELY 100% RECOMMENDED.\n\nThe game is amazing and the engine is beginning to show it's age but was something truely spectacular at the time, and the game is still a marvel. I hope you enjoy this great classic as much as my friends and I have.","May 23, 2014","true","23.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

As someone who hasn't played a Rainbow game since Black Arrow on the original xbox, and this one was okay. Few issues here and there, little ugly, but it's okay. Few issues with the guns, the riot shield completly ruins single player with perfect accuracy pistols and a shield no NPC can shoot around or through. It's just a decent game I guess. I liked 3 much more however, I recommend trying one of the older games in the series. If you're a big fan, get Vegas, if you just want to try a Rainbow game, vegas will somewhat do the job. 6.8/10. It's nothing new to the tactical FPS genre, but it has a few fun moments.","August 19, 2012","true","4.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Even then the A.I. can be very easily exploited and there is a clear and not always sensible hierarchy in the strength of the guns. There's also a lot of dressup features for your character model.\n\nNot many people play the campaign multi but this is the only way the campaign is really worth doing so that's sad. I would gladly run through it with someone because I've played every co-op multi map 300 times probably.\n\nThere's no matchmaking but the co-op "terrorist hunt" missions support four people and the story mode supports two with two AI teammates tagging along. There is a server browser and it's not awful but it's not incredible either.\n\nThe competitive multiplayer is basically people trying to camp the enemy spawn and hitting each other with burst-fire rifles or the tactical shotgun.","May 13, 2011","true","89.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Also, possibly my favourite part of the game is that you can fully customise your character with clothing and gun unlocks, even in singleplayer.

Even then the A.I. can be very easily exploited and there is a clear and not always sensible hierarchy in the strength of the guns. There's also a lot of dressup features for your character model.\n\nNot many people play the campaign multi but this is the only way the campaign is really worth doing so that's sad. I would gladly run through it with someone because I've played every co-op multi map 300 times probably.\n\nThere's no matchmaking but the co-op "terrorist hunt" missions support four people and the story mode supports two with two AI teammates tagging along. There is a server browser and it's not awful but it's not incredible either.\n\nThe competitive multiplayer is basically people trying to camp the enemy spawn and hitting each other with burst-fire rifles or the tactical shotgun.","May 13, 2011","true","89.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

So, I buy it, start it up, get to max rank because, lets be honest now, Realistic difficulty is probably the easiest Realistic difficulty on any game I've played before. I've memorized the spawn locations of enemies, and I was ready to go online and play some classic 2 player, tactical co-op gameplay. First thing that happens when I join a game? "Hi there." (You have been kicked and banned from the server.) Yeah, because apparantly my full body armour suit with yellow bee sting camoflauge with my M8 rifle and gear that these beta normies don't have, pisses them off. I mean, that's what I'm assuming, because only filthy casuals that are in control of servers would see someone so ♥♥♥♥ing OP compared to them and think, "Man, ♥♥♥♥ that guy, he doesn't belong here!" Oh well, enjoy getting killed by the shotguns that are instant one taps to the chest with your ballistic vest and Rainbow helmet, bud. Although, I really can't recommend this game since the story is absolute garbage, it's got about 4 hours of gaming content if you know what the hell you're doing, and there is barely any players online anymore, considering this was probably the last game in the R6 series with a somewhat decent campaign. 7/10.","May 5","true","29.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

However, even the mediocre Vegas 1 was pretty fun with it's four player co-op mode, and while a lot of the tactical elements were stripped away, we were still left with a competent, and occassionally intelligent shooter.\n\nVegas 2 seems to take those few things that I really enjoyed about the first, removes them, and focuses more on the things that made the first Vegas not very good to begin with. Gone is four player co-op campaign (inexplicably reduced to two player), the ability to customize your soldier right out of the box (for the PC version), and decent map design. Instead, what we get was a tedious and unneccessary progression system of unlocks, AI that seems to wildly alternate between being braindead and clairvoyant, and weaker PC optimization. And not that anyone plays a Tom Clancy game for the story, but for this one, they didn't even write a new script; instead it's the same moronic terrorist attack on Las Vegas, but following a different group of Rainbows, this one even less interesting that the last.\n\nI can't think of one thing that was improved in this sequel, and a large amount of content was made worse. A lazy sequel to a mediocre game, and a lazy port for an almost entirely consolized series. My advice: if you want a good Rainbow Six game, try the original three, or if you want a less tactical game, play the original Vegas. There's nothing here that isn't offered in any of those games, and generally it is done in a way that is far less frustrating.","August 16, 2013","false","12.5"," 12 of 26 people (46%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","46","12","26","9","0"

The servers hardly work, connecting online will take you half a day as you need to "just keep trying" until the game lets you on, then connecting to your friends game is a total coin flip of it's own.

This is as deep as a shallow pond and just as messy.","June 30, 2015","false","7.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","25","1","4","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fineas/recommended/15120/","fineas","Fineas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fineas/","332 products in account","This game has two faces so bare with me for this one:\n\nI love playing this game.\nIt's fun, exciting, descent graphics, good sound (their is a !!! large warning !!! about this though, more about that later)\n\nBoth the single player and multieplayer are fun to play with and things like terrorist hunt where you can multieplayer with up to 4 people with your friends to swipe a level of terrorist never gets old. Their are some minor annoyances of jittersish AI behavior: sometimes they react very slowly and other times they virtually 'teleport' around the corner and make an instant headshot. But it's more then workable, the game is beatable and enjoyable even through this.\n\nYou can customize your character a lot. Their are a whole range of skins, face features (mustaches, beards eyes) and that is just the face and body. You can equip different weapon sets per game and outfit your character with stuff you can unlock through gaining levels.\n\nThis leveling element has been flashed out well, their is a lot to unlock. It doesn't feel tedious because the game is well playable without a lot of unlocks. And it feels rewarding, it is just plain fun to see new stuff become available and show off your rank as well as your individual levels on assualt, CBQ and marksmen tactics.\n\nThe single player has a descent story and some interesting voice acting. It's no grande feast of fully inspired epic dialog and plot. But it's very enjoyable. Sometimes it takes a bit of good luck to get your AI colleges going and doing what they need to do, but again: it is more then workable and doesn't really halt the game in my opinion.\n\nI would love to keep playing this game, although their one big BUT:\nTheir is a persistent sound bug that keeps popping up, mainly in multieplayer . The bug seams to trigger when their is full automatic gun fire (which their is almost constantly in a heated battle) and has a chance to keep looping.\n\nImagine the rattling of an M16 or AK rifle and that it just keeps stuck. Mostly it's a gun causing the problem laying on the ground, if you can find it and pick it up it mostly disappears.\nBut I also found a similar bug that isn't fixable through this and in general gets worse. The former bug is location bound, when you move away the sound is gone. This big however keeps going in any part of the game (in-agem, loading screen, main menu) and can even carry on inside your operating system. I am NOT kidding, I have tried to find the volume of the game in the Win7 volume control to mute it, disabled and enabled my sound card, but the only thing that works is rebooting your whole machine.\n\nNow you might think, what does this rattling about a bug have to do in a review. Well, I am not the only one that has this bug. This bug is widely known and many, many users experience it. Their are a multietude of 'solutions' but nothing seams to stick. We have widely different system and have since we started playing all upgraded our machines or bought new ones, but the bugs stay. The internet is littered with forums etc that are filled with people with the same problem, but never a solid solution is provided.\n\nI do not understand how they have been able to make a game based on the Unreal Engine that is this flawed in the audio department. You might argue that this game is a bit older, but I don't see it that way. This game has an active community and has a lot of stuff to unlock that you can only achieve by playing it a hell of a lot. In that regard I am very disappointing in both this game and Ubisoft for not providing the community with either a statement or a solution.\n\nIf this game didn't have said bug, it would be an instance classic and in my opinion can go through the decades like Unreal Tournament 2K4, Medal of Honor: Pacific Assualt, Quake 3 Arena and Battle Field 1942.\n\nIt's really a game you can pick up where you left off, have a whole lot of fun, but their is always room for improvement. A pure skill game that doesn't have game mechanics that just throw off the game balance like the new COD: Modern Warfare or the newer UT and Quake games that just didn't feel like anything we loved about the orginal format.\n\nFor me Rainbow Six was always a miss, because the AI was terribly stupid and the game very hard to learn in general. This game isn't, I really enjoy playing it and explore everything it has. But for some reason I have to accept that I will have to endure regular persistent automatic gun fire blazing through my headphones that NEVER STOP.","February 13, 2014","false","8.8"," 12 of 31 people (39%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","39","12","31","4","0"

But a catastrophy in single player.\nWhile it keeps the mechanics of Rainbow Six Vegas, the gameplay changes.\nThe whole balance shifts heavily from a really tactical shooter, where you plan, prepare, then act to a more arcade-style shooter. that throws one nasty surprise at you after another. This means lots of situations where planning becomes hard, sudden tests of your reflexes, and many deaths that you dont feel responsible for. Add a few bugs (checkpoints not loading), missing features (restocking your ammo at the checkpoint must be repeated after every death, if you were low on ammo when you first arrived at the checkpoint. ) Also the AI of your team feels clumsy, they seem to stand in your way all the time.\nThe multiplayer modes are all fine, especially co-op which is fine just like in the first game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/idislikevideogames/recommended/15120/","idislikevideogames","Nightshade","http://steamcommunity.com/id/idislikevideogames/","123 products in account","I played the original rainbow six for the playstation in my younger days. It was a game that at the time, I couldn't necessarily comprehend fully, but I still loved it. I kept meaning to look into a game that offered me the methodical tactical based "choose where your team enters and what they do" gameplay that the original offered. I considered getting swat 4, but I felt that rainbow six was probably going to be the better choice. This however, was merely nostalgia.\n\nIn this game, you cannot select where you enter a conflict. There are set spawn points for you and your team and you cannot select any other spawn points or set your own at your descretion. You also seem to have less equipment or at least less equipment that isn't context sensitive, nor does your team really function like an actual counter-terrorism team. Or anything close to that. Your team are essentially two mediocre robots that you send out to either get shot or open doors. Not only do they lack personality but they're totally unnecessary. You could probably complete this entire game on the hardest difficulty with heavy armor, a heavy machine gun and nothing else. The maps aren't very creative in the way they're layed out. They're essentially layed out like counter-strike levels with enemy bots. If you want this type of experience, I recommend looking up a half-life 2 modification called "smod tactical" as it looks and feels better. It offers much more difficulty and you actually feel like you're doing something to your enemies.\n\nThis brings me to the other negative of this game. The weapons simply don't feel powerful. Even the strongest weapons in the game feel like sub-machine-guns firing nine milimetre rounds. There's no intensity, barely any difficulty, little creativity and fairly little fun.\n\nIf you're one of the people who might think this game might have a good story or good writing to carry the experience, then I regret to report that this game isn't what you're looking for either. From what I remember of the campaign, it felt like a typical call of duty game. Bad guys, shoot them. Help your personality lacking goons do something. Wait at the door until the scripted event triggers to open it. It isn't that fun, as a matter of fact I'd say that a call of duty might actually be better to buy than this. The gameplay in this is less fun and the level layouts are about as linear, if not more so. This game also has the distinct feeling of being a bit of a budget title. I've not researched the game's development, so I can't tell if it is one or not, but it certainly feels that way, and for a series that I would have called one of the greatest tactical shooters of all time at one point in my life, the fact that it has reached such a low note is tragic.\n\nThis game is worth just about as much as it costs. Do not expect it to really satisfy you in any real way. I wouldn't tell you to outright avoid it, but it's not that great and I abandoned playing it a quarter of the way through. Opting for instant action instead of campaign.\n\nAs a word of warning, I encountered a glitch with this game that made playing impossible. At one point, the game stopped registering mouse movement. I couldn't aim, shoot, look down my sights or anything that was done through the mouse. I tried plugging my xbox 360 controller in, it wouldn't register that either.","December 3, 2013","false","24.2"," 3 of 14 people (21%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","21","3","14","0","0"

The only franchise of games made by Ubisoft that's based truly on the works of the late great Tom Clancy, Rainbow Six is a long running series of tactical shooter games. This here is the latest entry in the series.\n\nBeing the 'sequel' to RS: Vegas, this game (obviously) takes place in the city of Las Vegas. Team Rainbow must stop a series of terrorist attacks throughout the city. This is the same premise as the last game. Not only is the basic plot almost the same as te last game but, pretty much everything is. It doesn't feel like a sequel but rather an expansion pack or something.\n\nThe difficulty is just horrendous when the buggy A.I. barely works. You going lone wolf most of the time with you team somewhere else. Another thing is the enemy A.I. They're ultimate deadeyes with guns. Their shots are just physically impossible to make in reality. (I assume) Currently, I can't think of anything that I liked about the game. 12 hours were invested to it trying make it work after my singleplayer data constantly kept deleting.\n\nThat's it.","December 27, 2013","false","12.7"," 3 of 14 people (21%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","21","3","14","0","0"

I assumed it was going to be good and it was a Major dissapointment for me. The fps wasnt the most stable in my opinion. I couldn't use my Xbox 360 controller on the game and had to use my keyboard and mouse. From using my keyboard and mouse I will say that it is not totaly bad on the account of doing certain things as far as  baisic movements in combat. Wish it woud have been better. I'd rather play the Division or maybe even Rainbow Six Seige than this game.","May 25","false","0.4"," 0 of 26 people (0%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","0","26","2","4"

Used to play this game for hours with my big brother and was super happy to see how inexpensive it was. Not much of a keyboard and mouse player (very tiny apartment, frankly I don't have the room. If I want to use a keyboard and mouse I legit have to lay down. Not great for fps.) Needless to say I have a controller I can plug in. Turns out even if the controller works with every other game you have to go in the back way to activate. And after an hour and a half of trying to get the stupid controller to work following a step by step guide on various forums I still can't get the bloody thing to work. And frankly I regret purchasing this now. So unless you're lucky enough for the forum fixes to work, or you prefer keyboard and mouse, don't bother.

With some of the best cover and shooting mechanics, Vegas 2 works great. But that's where the positives end, although terrorist hunt is fun and the campaign was pretty great, the major lacking issue in this game is the fact it is a port. When it works it works great and there’s no complaining about it, but when it doesn't work it's a disaster for everyone involved minus maybe the host of the current game. With awful sound glitches that trail off in your ear forever and buggy UbiSoft Login systems you may have difficulty signing in or not having to deal with sound bugs. When you do get it working it's an easy 9/10, sadly they just didn't put enough support into the PC version, so all in all 8/10.\n\nGreat game, just UbiSoft is an awful company from time to time.","December 26, 2014","true","124.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

With some of the best cover and shooting mechanics, Vegas 2 works great. But that's where the positives end, although terrorist hunt is fun and the campaign was pretty great, the major lacking issue in this game is the fact it is a port. When it works it works great and there’s no complaining about it, but when it doesn't work it's a disaster for everyone involved minus maybe the host of the current game. With awful sound glitches that trail off in your ear forever and buggy UbiSoft Login systems you may have difficulty signing in or not having to deal with sound bugs. When you do get it working it's an easy 9/10, sadly they just didn't put enough support into the PC version, so all in all 8/10.\n\nGreat game, just UbiSoft is an awful company from time to time.","December 26, 2014","true","124.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

You don't need 30-60 bullets to kill one player as always in other games, one bullet is enough to kill, if it's well shooted. There's no heal bar in game, you die when you get shooted, you have same heal as other terrorists. Bot team-mates are very clever and don't need to order many times like other games.

Vegas 2 is..almost the definition of tactical. Mechanics have you planning out your work. (You can do a basic breach and clear with either a frag or a flash by commaning your fellow operatives to do so. You can make them "stack up" by a door, while you work your way around and find a window to storm in from. From there, you can give them the word to breach while you come in from those windows behind.) Again, decisions matter in this game.  Also has a good customization system (unfortunately you can't save your customization but the game gives you no time limit) I can certainly recommend this to the tactical first and third person shooter player.

To me, Rainbow Six Vegas 2 was the last great military FPS. In a market flooded with Call Of Duty and Battlefield and (to an extent) ARMA, Rainbow Six Vegas 2 stands out to me as the most fun, replayable game of all of them.\nPlaying Terrorist Hunt is a massively tense solo experience and a brilliantly funny multiplayer experience. No matter how you play, this game accommodates for your style.\nIt will make you think slowly and strategically about your actions, something that modern FPSs seem to have completely forgotten about. The innovative mechanics, such as rappelling, ropes and ladders add a degree of verticality to the maps, making them replayable to an almost infinite extent.\nIf you have (somehow) never played this game, you owe it to yourself to experience one of the greatest and most original first person shooters of this generation.","March 7, 2014","true","40.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The challenging yet satisfying gameplay never fails to please me even after playing the game for nearly six years. This game offers a quality single-player story, and extends the experience with the various Adversarial modes or the cooperative mode, Terrorist Hunt (Which in my opinion is the best portion of the game). I consider this game to be greatly underrated and certainly worth a play, while the unconventional controls make the game difficukt to grasp at first, once you've got the hang of it the game will become a challenging experience with tremendous replay value.\n\nTL;DR\n+Realistic and challenging gameplay\n+Good story\n+Fantastic Co-Op\n+Very high replay value\n-Bizzarre controls\n-Poor graphics and sound\n-Rough gameplay\n\nOverall: 9/10","March 11, 2014","true","16.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With gameplay based on stealth and assault it take on a very unique style. Yes, although there are not many enemies on the screen at once like some other games, these enemies think and act very quickly and are no afraid to shoot you down immediately. Even though some parts of this game are frustrating, the intesity of the gameplay keeps you going. One wrong step could easily lead you to your demise. Sometimes though in multiplayer there are a few minor errors and glitchs. It doesn't take much away from this game seeing as it came out years ago. As for a rating I give this game an 8 out of 10. The reason for this is just because of a few minor glitches and the lack of enemies.","March 12, 2014","true","30.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You don't need 30-60 bullets to kill one player as always in other games, one bullet is enough to kill, if it's well shooted. There's no heal bar in game, you die when you get shooted, you have same heal as other terrorists. Bot team-mates are very clever and don't need to order many times like other games.

Yeah sure the graphics are not up to par even for 2006-2008 standards, but thats just because it focused more into the gameplay aspects of it. Sometimes the computer can get random insta-kill headshots out of nowhere, but just knowing that makes you feel much more vulnerable. You have to play this game tactically, you CAN run and gun because of the faster pace of the game, but you are REALLY going to balance things out, to know when to go in and when to stay back and toss a nade, thats what makes this game so fun. Its 10$, even less with sales that happen frequently, meaning its a cheap, fun game you can play with your friends, or forever alone if you have no friends. I highly recommend this game, worth every penny.","February 23, 2014","true","123.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Gameplay changes inclue the ever obvious "moar guns and maps", to the addition of a sprint button, grenade indicators to let you know that it's nearby, slightly better AI that now suppress and flank you, and bullet penetration.\n\nIt all sounds good, however there's no longer 4 player story mode co-op, only 2 players because for some reason the developers thought it would be better to force you to play with two AI companions for almost the entire game. The guns handle differently, so you can't as easily hit people on the move anymore so despite a sprint funciton being added, the game does play at a slightly slower pace unless you're in extremely tight spaces. Also the grenade indicator makes it significantly easier. While there's still 4 player co-op in the terrorist hunt mode, the lack of 4 player story mode is a bit of a detractor.\n\nI'll recommend it because at it's core it is a solid game with some nice co-op and level design, in some cases better than the first Vegas. However if it came down to this one and the first game in the Vegas series, I would pick the first one.","September 20, 2015","true","29.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game itself is pretty solid, but it is lacking in a few areas. The campaign is pretty uninvolving and a bit silly at times. I never played the first game although I didn't feel like I was missing out on much. The game has pretty plain and rushed scenery; bad trees and recycled wispy sky boxes. I haven't played the multiplayer because it requires third party verification with gamespy(?). In the end, about 70% of my time in this game is lost to the "Terrorist Hunt" mode. Pretty fun, but after a while you can see that the game is rough around the edges with NPC AI. More often than not, you'll find yourself proclaiming "♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t!" when an enemy who is looking the other way shoots you with his back, or runs into a room you're in knowing exactly where you are. In the end, dealing with the AI is a test of patience; you have to learn to deal with their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to win games.","February 6, 2012","true","54.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The challenging yet satisfying gameplay never fails to please me even after playing the game for nearly six years. This game offers a quality single-player story, and extends the experience with the various Adversarial modes or the cooperative mode, Terrorist Hunt (Which in my opinion is the best portion of the game). I consider this game to be greatly underrated and certainly worth a play, while the unconventional controls make the game difficukt to grasp at first, once you've got the hang of it the game will become a challenging experience with tremendous replay value.\n\nTL;DR\n+Realistic and challenging gameplay\n+Good story\n+Fantastic Co-Op\n+Very high replay value\n-Bizzarre controls\n-Poor graphics and sound\n-Rough gameplay\n\nOverall: 9/10","March 11, 2014","true","16.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With gameplay based on stealth and assault it take on a very unique style. Yes, although there are not many enemies on the screen at once like some other games, these enemies think and act very quickly and are no afraid to shoot you down immediately. Even though some parts of this game are frustrating, the intesity of the gameplay keeps you going. One wrong step could easily lead you to your demise. Sometimes though in multiplayer there are a few minor errors and glitchs. It doesn't take much away from this game seeing as it came out years ago. As for a rating I give this game an 8 out of 10. The reason for this is just because of a few minor glitches and the lack of enemies.","March 12, 2014","true","30.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The controls are very clunky, and the AI is an insult to programming: I don't know if it could be called such, as every action they do has to be dictated by a separate command: they don't breach with you, you tell them to breach and then do it yourself. You tell them to climb, then follow or lead. You tell them to go up, to go down. You have to constantly be updating their orders.\n\nGiven that the default control layout needs to be reworked on PC. It took me a few tries but I've gotten a combination where I'm finding this game playable and enjoyable.
