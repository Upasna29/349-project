Can you even be offended at that? The game does use polygonal graphics and what appears to be vertex lighting, but I think most integrated graphics chips can handle this amount of detail. Don't quote me on that one. Most systems out there can run this game no problem... If they are Windows systems.\n\nMaybe the friend requirement? Flipping through the manual yourself still provides an interesting experience. The entire game can be beaten with one person or with the participation of 20 or more people. How many games are like that?\n\nLack of voice chat feature? The game has full Steam support, making this a non-issue.\n\nLack of netcode? The design of the game makes this irrelevant. You don't even need an internet connection, but to initially download the game.\n\nFrustration? You can pick up or close the game at any time. Learning to play it without griping at others or being discouraged is probably good for your social health. It's far less frustrating or "cheap" than many modern games, too: bounding boxes in Dark Souls 2, spawns in flanking in Call of Duty, unreasonable level design in Hotline Miami 2. Bombs are self-contained puzzles and you lose only seconds if you make a mistake, not hours of effort. In fact, the more level-headed you are, the better you will be at the game.\n\nBrevity? This one I could see, but the main collection of bombs is only to introduce the mechanics and give some gimmicky setups in the first place. Once you complete it, you can free play whenever you want, as the design calls for well over 11^11 (that's about 2.9 * 10^11) variations. It's unlikely you will ever play the same bomb twice if your objective is variation.\n\nCost? It's $15 right now; if you go in with friends it's a drop in the bucket. I don't feel too bad about the development:cost differential, but I suppose that's up to personal preference.\n\nKeep Talking and Nobody explodes is an accessible, inexpensive, tightly designed game. Even if you're never played a party game or don't care for them, this one is a glimmering example. After hours of consideration, the only problem I can think of is that it seems to be Windows-only at the moment. Do you have Windows and some fraction of $15? Do you like fun games that reward skill, intelligence, and cooperation? If you said yes, it's time to buy.","October 29, 2015","true","5.5"," 403 of 422 people (95%) found this review helpful 38 people found this review funny","95","403","422","38","11"

It will certainly test your friendship or marriage, lol. At first glance, I questioned if there was enough game here to merit the pricetag, but oh boy is there. There are tons of levels, and even a puzzle generator where you can alter various puzzle dynamics. The levels increase in difficulty nicely.\n\nThere is a manual that you print out, and you are free to study it as much as you want. One person works with the bomb - they are the only ones that are allowed to see the screen. The other person(s) is using the manual as a tool to help you solve the puzzles on the bomb. It is helpful to play with more than two people - we had an extra person and you could divvy out puzzles to save time. The average time they give you to solve a bomb is 5 minutes.\n\nPros:\n+Awesome fresh take on a co-op puzzle game\n+Puzzles are really well done - it would take a long time to 'memorize' the manual or be an expert at this game\n+Lots of room for future DLC (ie. a new manual version, game modes, etc.)\n+Controls are minimal and work well\n\nCons:\n-I am not certain that you could complete every bomb with just two people\n-I prefer this in short bursts rather than long play sessions\n-People seem to have strong opinions on which role they like playing - for example, I literally refuse to be the expert with the manual. Thankfully my friends want that role, and they refuse to run the computer. That could be a factor.\n\nTotally worth the money - I will certainly be toying with this for a long time.","October 11, 2015","true","4.1"," 111 of 119 people (93%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","93","111","119","12","3"

You must disarm the bomb before the timer on said bomb runs out. How ever, you have no manual. In comes the co-op mechanic as your friends have a manual that they can use to instruct you on how to disarm the bomb. This is a game where your friendships will either solidify, or very likely yourself, blow up to pieces.\n\nThe bomb you're given has modules which take the form of various puzzles that you must solve and complete in order to disarm the bomb. You can have up to eleven modules in total that range in difficulty. You will have to trust your partners to decipher the information you're giving them. They must be able to use that information and read what the manual instructs before finally giving you the instructions you need to disarm the bomb before it disarms you.\n\nTo conclude, this is an incredibly fun game. Co-Op done absolutely right. It also comes with Oculus Rift support. Pick this game up, you will not be disappointed. If you don't want to disarm the bomb but love giving instructions, the manual is absolutely free to use via the link below.\n\nBomb Manual.

Pretty innovative, yet a natural fit for its genre.  Also, you only need one copy of the game for as many players as you want, which gives it great value.\n\nGameplay: 38/40\nThe game doesn't waste any time getting to the action.  The game feels tense right from the first bomb, even if you end up with plenty of time left.  The defuser's job is to tell the experts what kind of wiring and such is on the bomb, and the experts look them up in the manual.  The experts then tell the defuser what to do to disarm each module.  Usually the game consists of a series of questions and instructions.  This might sound boring to some people, but the modules are very well designed to make it fun.  They range from simple wires that require going through a list of options until you get to the correct one, to "who's on first" modules that require careful enunciation.  The modules that are the least interesting also take the least time.\nI think most people would progress in skill quickly, but fortunately, so does the game.  There are quite a number of scenarios that excellently pace the players through all the mechanics, and each one is procedurally generated.  There's also a custom bomb mode that could provide theoretically endless hours.  One would think that the game would become repetitive, but it literally takes five minutes, so it never feels grindy.  The one thing I could see to improve the game would simply be more modules.  But there's certainly enough as it is.\n\nAesthetic: 20/20\nThe game isn't the most realistic looking, but it's in that zone and feels super appropriate.  Everything looks nice, there's no extraneous clutter, and the sounds are perfectly suited to the atmosphere.  The details are nice too; occasionally the lights will turn off for a few seconds, but the lit screens on the bomb stay visible.  Great job here.\n\nLength: 9/10\nWhile the game provides a mountain of different possibilities, it does have a limit.  That limit won't be reached for a long time, but it's there.  It's kind of like a Rubik's cube: once you've mastered it, then you can only refine your skills.  But it has like ten times the fun and complexity of a Rubik's cube.\n\nTechnical: 20/20\nThe game runs smoothly.  I haven't run into any bugs whatsoever, and the manual is easily available online as a pdf, a webpage, or printed.  The controls are tight.  Not much to say when there's nothing wrong. :)\n\nTotal: 97/100\nKeep Talking and Nobody explodes is one of the best games I've picked up this year.  It's simple, but that simplicity is one of it's strengths.  It's a pure rendition of a great idea, and will surely bring a lot of laughter and yelling.","October 11, 2015","true","3.9"," 92 of 98 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","92","98","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wolfblitz101/recommended/341800/","wolfblitz101","The Gringo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wolfblitz101/","115 products in account","I will review this from two points of view: As gamer, and as an ESL teacher. At the time of reviewing this I have only 30 minutes played, but my experience with this game goes beyond my own account.\n\nGamer:\nIf you're looking for an epic single player dungeon crawler like Skyrim or Witcher, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a guns-blazing experience like CoD or Battlefield, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a slow, calm strategic game for the family like Monopoly, look elsewhere.\nWhat you will find here is a unique experience that other games cannot deliver.\n-Communication and trust are key. They are more necessary in this simple game than in any military shooter or other co-op experience that you will find.\n-There is also a small bit of strategy that plays into the game; do you tell you friend(s) about the easy modules first, or the hard one? Do you use your own memorized knowlegde of the manual to save some time, or rely on the expert that has the manual in hand?\n-A single mistake, even in the early levels, can cause panic. Some of the multi-stage modules will reset to the beginning if you make a mistake. My wife and I played this game together. She had the manual. We had over a minute left. It was a module that requires you to remember numbers and positions. We were on the second to last step, and I made a mistake. We stayed calm and kept going. Step three, she read the wrong instructions. One chance left. Thirty seconds. I'm almost shouting the numbers. Fifteen seconds. She's reading too slow. Last stage. I say the number. Time: five seconds. She starts reading the instructions. I can't... I push the button. An explosion rocks our living room. Moments before we had been calm and collected, and in the final two seconds I panicced and pushed a random button.\n-Replayability; Even playing through the same levels with a different friend can be exciting. Once you're tired of that, there's a free play mode that allows you to customize the game to your liking. Make it as hard or easy as you like. Want to give yourself thirty seconds to solve 11 modules with no extra chances if you make a mistake? It's your funeral, but you can.\n-Party play; Break this game out during a party or dinner with friends and you'll have an extremely exciting experience.\n\n\nESL Teacher (Adult students)\nI'm always looking outside the classroom for things that can help improve the learning experience. This game has extremely high potential. Once students have reached an appropriate level of fluency, this game will provide a tense situation in which they will need to work together outside their own language. Considering the bomb manual is in English, translating the instructions back into their native tongue will only slow them down. I will definitely use this in my classroom to provide an interesting alternative to drilling vocabulary.\n(Note to devs: If you don't want me to use this in a classroom setting, just let me know.)\n\nDo I recommend this game? Absolutely.\n\nNow excuse me, I need to go learn Morse Code.","October 12, 2015","true","4.4"," 82 of 90 people (91%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","91","82","90","15","2"

Can you even be offended at that? The game does use polygonal graphics and what appears to be vertex lighting, but I think most integrated graphics chips can handle this amount of detail. Don't quote me on that one. Most systems out there can run this game no problem... If they are Windows systems.\n\nMaybe the friend requirement? Flipping through the manual yourself still provides an interesting experience. The entire game can be beaten with one person or with the participation of 20 or more people. How many games are like that?\n\nLack of voice chat feature? The game has full Steam support, making this a non-issue.\n\nLack of netcode? The design of the game makes this irrelevant. You don't even need an internet connection, but to initially download the game.\n\nFrustration? You can pick up or close the game at any time. Learning to play it without griping at others or being discouraged is probably good for your social health. It's far less frustrating or "cheap" than many modern games, too: bounding boxes in Dark Souls 2, spawns in flanking in Call of Duty, unreasonable level design in Hotline Miami 2. Bombs are self-contained puzzles and you lose only seconds if you make a mistake, not hours of effort. In fact, the more level-headed you are, the better you will be at the game.\n\nBrevity? This one I could see, but the main collection of bombs is only to introduce the mechanics and give some gimmicky setups in the first place. Once you complete it, you can free play whenever you want, as the design calls for well over 11^11 (that's about 2.9 * 10^11) variations. It's unlikely you will ever play the same bomb twice if your objective is variation.\n\nCost? It's $15 right now; if you go in with friends it's a drop in the bucket. I don't feel too bad about the development:cost differential, but I suppose that's up to personal preference.\n\nKeep Talking and Nobody explodes is an accessible, inexpensive, tightly designed game. Even if you're never played a party game or don't care for them, this one is a glimmering example. After hours of consideration, the only problem I can think of is that it seems to be Windows-only at the moment. Do you have Windows and some fraction of $15? Do you like fun games that reward skill, intelligence, and cooperation? If you said yes, it's time to buy.","May 3","true","74.3"," 39 of 41 people (95%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","95","39","41","8","0"

Have PTSD? Want to have fun? BUY THIS GAME  Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes is a very different multiplayer experience and may und up with ruined friendships. You either have a buddy on steam chat or in the same room not able to see your screen tell you how to defuse a bomb. You can not see the defuse guide and the people with the defuse guide (Experts) can not see the screen. So you got to describe every little detail to them as they ask you questions. I personaly played a very little amount but already had a blast with my friends. Because the game offers Freeplay mode where you can choose time limit, how many modules and more. You also need to be very crafty when it comes to some of the modules. Like the symbol pad modules. You WILL come up with names for these symbols. Ex: Alien mothership, man purse, bathtub. The possibilites are endless.  One recomendation is that the buddy you play with is a good friend because he can screw you over with some simple words. I personaly was the bomb defuser and my buddy the expert.  DONT HAVE FRIENDS? NO PROB!  Just message a few of your steam friends "Want to help defuse a bomb?" That will get their attention. I highly doubt that this review will ever have to be changed due to the nature of the game. YOU LITTERALY CANT SCREW IT UP! I remember doing things similar to this back in elementry school. But because i designed the stuff it was easy.    NOTE IF YOU HAVE ISSUES WITH THE HEART DUE TO STRESS DO NOT PLAY.    In the first mission I was sweating so bad that at the end I had to put ice in my shirt. This a great party game to play with people you know and people you dont know.

You had to trust everything they said and follow their instructions exactly. Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes takes this concept and makes it hilarious and fun. The concept is devilishly simple in design, one player defuses the bomb, another player has the instructions of how to defuse it. Neither of them can see what the other is doing. Communication is absolutely integral to the gameplay of this title. Psychologist will probably use this game to stress test people. This is as much of a social experiment as it is a clever puzzle game. Visually, Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes is rather simple, nothing to fancy but it does look good. The music on other hand does get more violent and intense as the timer begins to run down. Adding to the delicious stress and tension. Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes is an amazing example of thinking outside the box and typical gaming conventions. This is why I love Indie Games this is the type of innovation that Triple A developers would never dare to try. There is excellent design here, no bugs, and something anyone can play. The only gripe I could muster is that the person giving the instructions might not have as much fun as the bomb defuser.  Otherwise this is a great game and easily worth your attention, time, and money!\n\nI made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/gzsmog5iCzQ\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","October 16, 2015","true","0.7"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","25","28","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/saunika/recommended/341800/","saunika","saunika","http://steamcommunity.com/id/saunika/","98 products in account","Let me start by pointing out the two factors that had me hesitating this purchase, in case anyone else has similar concerns:\n\n1. Is this game too complicated to play with an average non-gamer buddy?\n2. Is this seemingly one-trick-pony really worth the price they're asking?\n\nI played this game with my girlfriend using an Oculus Rift DK2 and by the end of the first bomb disarm, my concerns disappeared almost instantly.\n\nThe manual, complicated as it may seem on first glance, is actually pretty straight-forward. The rules for each module (puzzles you need to solve in order to disarm the bomb) only really start to make sense when you're in the moment and they turn out to be pretty easy to understand. The game's "story" mode, if you can call it that, felt like a really good learning curve that hooks you in instantly. I switched between the defuser and instructor and both felt equally challenging and fun to play. You don't necessarily need to have any prior knowledge to understand and complete each module, although it may help speed up your time. Communication is really all it boils down to.\n\nSo, once we got the hang of the game and the modules, did it start to feel stale? After all, there's only a handful of modules, right? Nope. The possibilities feel endless and every new bomb feels like a fresh challenge. Even when you get a set of modules that don't intimidate you at all, you're still rushing for a faster time than the last. Best of all, failing at this game doesn't feel annoying or like you're being punished. Every failure makes you analyze where you went wrong and how you can improve next time. Before you know it, you're rushing back into retrying.\n\nSo, is it worth the price?\n\nPersonally, I thought it was pretty steep for a game that's sole objective involves you sitting in one room and defusing a bomb. As soon as I got to experience it, however, I realized that this game plays and feels like a good tabletop game without any of the annoying setup and reset times. Its super interactive and uses an original simple objective that is infinitely entertaining. Its the kind of game you can put down for a few months and come back to when you have some friends over and have just as much fun as the first time you played it. In that sense, I think the price is justified. This game wouldn't even need to be a video game to be enjoyed, but it just works so well in the digital medium.","October 10, 2015","true","6.8"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","21","22","2","1"

Oh well, it's not the end of the world. :/\n\nBest CO-OP game of 2015.\n\nOn a more serious note, this is probably the best and most amazing CO-OP game I've ever played. Also slightly thrifty considering the fact that not everyone who wants to play needs to purchase as they can be the bomb defusal expert who explains what the ♥♥♥♥ you need to do.\n\nThis game can be extremely stressful at times, I recommend going into thsi game with absolutely ZERO knowledge on how to play, and don't allow your defuser to read anything until you start. This will make it more enjoyable. I love the fact that when you repeat levels they change the bomb so you don't really ever get a bomb with the exact same amount/type of modules often, if at all. The only downside is that there aren't enough variables in regards to some of the "mini-games" or modules, for example I've played for two hours with a few of my friends and I now memorized most of how to defuse the simple wires, and how to do simon says depending on your bomb's serial number. (I was never the person that read the manual, and did not even open the .pdf, but getting the same module too many times may do this to you).\n\nAll in all, I'll keep this review relatively short. The game does a lot to try to throw you off, it flickers lights, goes completely dark, makes annoying noises, makes the bomb beep in a random fashion, and just tries to ♥♥♥♥ you up for the sake of a challenge. This is extremely appreciated as it makes the game much more stressful and enjoyable.\n\nThis is one of the few games that I have ever rated highly, but it deserves a 9/10, even for concept alone. I'm surprised nobody else ever thought to do this.\n\nThis game can easily be a party game, place a laptop on a table, a few bomb defusal manuals, place blankets or something so eye contact cannot be made, and start yelling at each other.

If thats the case, the replay value, which is already pretty high, will be that much higher.\n\nThis game is designed for two or more players, but after playing with a buddy of mine for a couple of hours I am reasonably certain that even playing solo will provide an interesting challange.

KT&NE puts one player in the position of the bomb handler, while their teammates will come to the game equipped with an in-depth bomb manual. You know where this is going. One player will be restricted to viewing the bomb, and their job is to describe the various modules to the person with the manual, in order for the 'expert' (manual holder) to help them out to defuse it. This. Game. Is. Epic.\n\nGameplay\nThat depends on how good you are at communicating. All of the tools come with this game to create an epic gameplay experience, whether you're using KT&NE as a party game with friends, or utilising a voice communcation program and using digital copies of the manual; this game has the potential to make or break friendships. There is nothing more frustrating than losing a level becuase your friend ain't bright enough to listen to simple instructions!!1!one!!.. Right!?\n\nGraphics & Sound\nIncredible. This game is supported by both PC and Virtual Reality. While I haven't had the opportunity to see the game through the oculus rift, I can vow that the graphics & sound standard on the PC is up to par, it does its job to make the game seem both realistic and intense, for damn sure.\n\nReplayability\nI've played this game for 4 hours straight before.

My boyfriend and I have breezed through the first ten stages or so, and are quite honestly flabbergasted at how stupid some of the manual-readers are in the various YouTube videos we've watched.\n\nMore than anything, it's important to keep a cool head. If your manual-reader or manual-readers screw up and you end up getting a strike, it's not going to do you any good to get angry with them - if anything, it will just make them more nervous and more likely to screw up a second or third time during the same run.\n\nThat having been said, the game also has various ways in which it likes to give you a swift kick in the stones when it comes to rattling your nerves: There's a desk clock sitting next to you, and from time to time it likes to set off its alarm mid-mission. If you happen to be spectacularly unlucky, the game will cut power to the lights for a few seconds, leaving you in the darkness. No, don't turn up the brightness on your monitor to compensate. That's cheating.\n\nOverall, I have to say that the game is great fun, and I'd love to play even more of it, but my boyfriend is boycotting his role as manual-reader for the rest of the evening due to his nerves being completely wrecked. Hopefully I can get a group together this weekend to play it some more.","October 8, 2015","true","4.3"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","16","16","2","0"

One of the things they've done best is that it's very hard to act as an expert without the manual.  Playing a few games, there were only a few things as a defuser that I was able to learn and do autonomously.  The number of different modules types that you have to solve is well balanced between over-familiarity and needing to flip through too many pages each time.  Naming the puzzles is good for progressing as a team.  The manual is well made, although it could benefit from a contents page.\n\nThe game is very fun as a party game or team game with friends.  It's pretty fun to teach and quick to learn if someone is teaching you.  It also is pretty fun to play by yourself (reading the manual yourself) and is a good way to learn the game's modules in order to teach others.  However, it's not recommended that you buy the game just to play it yourself.","October 9, 2015","true","2.7"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

It's an amazing co-op experience. I've been asking random people on Steam that I never talk to to play it with me (five minutes or less!) and they're always skeptical at first but after 15 minutes they're hooked. I've convinced two people to buy it already. I've created or renewed friendships with people I didn't know just by playing this game for a bit. If you're shy but enjoy video games, try playing this sucker with someone. You'll be friends forged in fire in ten minutes or less!\n\nIf there is a single bad thing I can say about this game, it's that it will eventually get old if it never gets another update. Fortunately I'm not too worried about that.\n\nIf you're even remotely interested in this game, buy it. It's worth the full price.

I would also like to mention it's totally her fault and definitely not mine as she continually insisted.  Despite my consistent tendency to die a horribly painful firey death, cursing her name as the flesh charred from my bones like some sort of circle of the inferno, I continuously came back for more. Repeating the proces of this unique and wonderful torture until my gut became sore with laughs.  The game does a great job of ramping up the complexity of the bomb defusal process, allowing an extremely false sense of confidence to build. As you defuse bomb after bomb, you start to think "Hey. I'm pretty good at this. Maybe I should look into a bomb defusal school, or something. I could save lives!" the game slams you back to reality by blindsiding you with a request to remember steps you have taken previously.  As the timer continued it's deathmarch to my oblivion, I sat there, cursing the heavens that it was "unfair" to presemue I, a simple bomb defusal expert, could remember uncomplicated steps I took literally moments ago.  Despite the extremely painful process of exploding, I am glad I finally got to play this game, and look forward to the day when I can sweat over a bomb in an oculus / vive or some other future type device.","October 26, 2015","true","0.7"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","8","8","2","0"

You and the people you're working with will quickly develop a set of things to be looking for, fast solutions, and a vocabulary unique to the group. Do be forewarned that this game can be stressful and hectic, but cathartic when the puzzle is completed. I cannot recommend this game for people who don't handle stress well or have a heart condition so take it with a grain of salt that I find this game fun. The random nature of the modules and the time limit aren't your only obstacles, an alarm on the desk can go off making communication with your team difficult, the lights can go out without warning and may or may not come back on, as well as modules that need to be regularly interacted with, a limited number of mistakes that can even be removed entirely meaning your first mistake is your last, and various other parts of interest on the bomb that can change how each module is disarmed.\n\nDo you love puzzles? Do you love communicating what you can see to people that cannot? Do you love being under a time crunch that challenges you to be clear and concise while trusting your friends to communicate back to you?\nThen Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes is perfect for you.\nAre you easily distracted, easily stressed out, or have a heart condition that is exacerbated by being stressed out?\nAvoid this game like the plague!\n\nBoth you and your team will get frustrated early and often, the twenty-three page manual is clear but difficult to work through without a physical copy in front of you, but once the modules are solved and the bomb is disarmed you and your team feel fantastic as the tension and stress are all released.","November 4, 2015","true","3.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/snowdusk/recommended/341800/","snowdusk","Snowdusk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/snowdusk/","87 products in account","Most people have probably heard of Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes (abbreviated as KTANE) and watched someone else play it in Youtube or Twitch. Most of these people would have also played along with other people who owned KTANE because only one copy of the game is required for an entire party to play, which is awesome.\n\nAt this point, these people can't help but to buy their own copy of the game because of the sheer amount of fun it offers. So what exactly makes this game fun?\n\nWell first of all, there is a timed bomb involved. Only one person (the bomb defuser) gets to disarm it while the rest of his friends (the bomb experts) will try to help him based on a bomb manual. The catch is: only the bomb defuser is allowed to see the bomb, and only the bomb experts are allowed to look at the manual. That makes communication an integral part of KTANE, making it an excellent social party game.\n\nNow I will share my personal experience with this game as well. When I got my siblings to play KTANE with me, I didn't carry any high expectations at first. My younger brother and sister hardly ever liked the same games as I do. Whenever I try to get them to play a game with me, they were clearly uninterested. But when I bought KTANE and convinced them to try it out together, they played it and agreed that it was thrilling. Soon, as we're disarming bombs like a real team, I realised how exciting it is to find a common game where everyone plays a role in it.\n\nThe game is definitely worth the price, so go ahead and grab the game if you can find a group of people to play with. There's a saying that goes "time plus tragedy equals comedy". And since this game is all about timed bombs, getting a bunch of people to scream orders over a virtual bomb can be pretty funny.","November 8, 2015","true","7.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","8","9","2","0"

The concept is both simple and complex, as it all comes down to communicating a series of small tasks to a friend before a bomb explodes.  Sounds easy, but in practice, gets tricky very quickly.  Hijinks will ensue, someone WILL blow up, and everyone will have their blood pumping as they laugh at the end of both successful defusals and violent ends.\n\nAlso, I suspect almost any system can run this.  Hell, in a game with a live bomb, there isn't even a visual explosion, and I DID NOT CARE.  It's just... I mean... this game is so.... perfect.\n\nBuy this.  Pay these people.  Support it, nurture it, and make sure that the people at Steel Crate Games get rich fast enough to pump out more content for this game while continuing to innovate.\n\nSteel Crate Games?  Have my baby, damn it.

The bomb defuser is given a bomb with a variey of modules and must defuse it without looking at the guide him/herself. thats also the same the other way around the bomb experts are only able to read the guide and are not alowed to see the bomb. this makes for an interesting gameply style as communication is key.Truthfully this game is a breath of fresh air. its unique and is quite fun to play, the only problem i have with it is the fact that i have no freinds.\n\nGameplay - 9/10\n-the gameplay is fun, whether it be sittting in the same room wiht your freinds or playing over skype or streams or any other way. the mechanics are simple yet, work well with the gameplay and Design. the modules can range from being easy, to being dificult real quick, and the short bomb times makes it an easy game to jump into and out of real quick. The bomb times usually last between 3 to 5 minutes although can be changed in the free play mode. Because the gameplay is based around communication things can get pretty tense between you and your freinds this makes it more enjoyable. as there is no better feeling then dissarming a bomb with less then 5 seconds remaining after yelling to your freind " I'm just going to cut the black wire and hope for the best!" and it actually working. But like i said earlier you need people to play this game, that being said' its still a good buy for those occasions that your freinds do come by for a visit or your family want to play.\n\nGraphics- 7/10\nthis secction will be quite small. the graphics are simple in nature and don't contract away from the gameplay. this game could be a retro 8-bit game and it would still be good as the gameplay elements are there. The textures are good and the simple designs of the bomb and surroundings work well within the game\n\nStory- 2/10\nthere is no story, again this game focuses around the gameplay. However if you really wanted you could roleplay with freinds and make your own story for the situation to make the gameplay feel more hectic and fun.\n\nOverall- 9/10\nthis game is amazingly fun and as long as you have people to play with you should  be fine. even if you don't it shouldnt be hard to find someone, a family member will do fine. even a random on steam is ok, as long as they have a microphone that workls well and there is no language barriers then it should work out fine. so overall this game is worth  the small amount of money the developers are asking.","October 28, 2015","true","10.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

They don’t require a tremendous amount of money and time spent. Sometimes all it takes is a weekend and a huge coffee supply. For Steel Crate Games that weekend was Global Game Jam 2014, where they made a concept for an Oculus Rift game where only one player sees what’s happening on screen.\n\nLuckily, the final version of Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes doesn’t require any kind of virtual reality set, but it still needs one very important component – co-players. The game is impossible to play solo and you’ll need at least one more person in the same room, or the next room if shouting across the apartment is ok with you, or if all else fails, an online co-player who you can talk to through a VOIP service.\n\nKeep Talking and Nobody Explodes is a game you simply must try out, it’s both a video game and a social game, and simultaneously a test for reflexes and concentration. No video in the world can possibly convey the exact feeling you get while playing – frantically going through pages with schemes and directions or waiting for your co-players to come up with a solution while there’s only seconds left on the timer. Get your copy, call your friends, neighbors and colleagues, print out the manual and dig into one of the most exciting co-op experiences of all time. And keep talking, never stop talking. Because if you keep talking nobody will explode.\n\nFull review here: http://play-zine.com/2015/11/keep-talking-and-nobody-explodes/","March 1","true","3.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

You've probably never played anything like it--the real gameplay is not the puzzles you solve, but the communication between you and your "expert".  Plays well locally or over any voice chat program.\n\nPuzzles are cleverly designed to have just enough parts to them that you're always going to have to look them up not just remember them, so communication remains a factor. Interestingly, you basically also reset the difficulty just by getting a new "expert" who doesn't know the game as well.\n\nEscalation of difficulty is smooth but quite fast. Morse code puzzles are a bit of a brick wall, but otherwise each new puzzle was challenging but reasonable to overcome, and the bombs grow more complex as you go through the..."story mode" or whatever you want to call it.","October 8, 2015","true","2.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Currently engaged to a lady over 4000 miles away and we've played a lot of multiplayer games to kill time whilst we wait on a visa, but this one gave us more laughs, drama, excitement and plain *fun* than we've had with any other single game.\n\nI don't want to spoil anything for anyone considering playing this but I will say if you're looking for something truly new, you enjoy working on your communication skills and have a good relationship with someone else to play with then you're definitely going to have a blast with this game.\n\nWorth every penny and then some.","October 11, 2015","true","2.4"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

So I would like to start on the bad stuff about the game. This is namely the fact that you need a second player. But! and that is a big BUT! It has been designed to be a co-operative game and it is stated that another player is needed for good reasons. This game is mediocre alone. You feel like you are not doing things right, which you are not.\n\nI have a few family members intrigued by this game so I have no problems there. There is always skype possibilities as well has steam chatting. I honestly don't think that it would be hard to get someone to like this game. It is fun and amazing. Once you have a friend who liks the game, you are set.\n\nSo besides this small issue (In my opinion), I have had no problems at all. Balance is perfect, freeplay was a great feature, has a simple and intuitive tutorial which explains most concepts, the manual is stylishly done with aneasy to read format. I can not really think of anything not to love.\n\nSure, at times the game might be frustrating in the "Campaign", but a click to freeplay later and you can play with bombs more to your level, but at the same time, bombs you have not completed. This game did think quite a few things through.\n\nI enjoy the simplicity of the artstyle. It does not take away from the game, but at the same time it does not overwhelm and make you focus more on the beautiful side of the bobms rather than the BOMB-IS-ABOUT-TO-KILL-YOU-♥♥♥ aspect.\n\nI love seeing these great gems pop allover the steam store.

The other is given a URL to see the bomb manual.\n\nThat's in the description, so you'd think people would know, eh?\nThis game is wonderful fun, but a different kind of fun from most games you'll find on steam.\nAbsolutely a party game, its purpose seems in line with games like Mario Party. If you and your partner laugh, you come out feeling like you've won. Even if the alarm clock won't shut the hell up.\n\nWhile I've only played a bit, and will update if/when I have more experience, it does seem that the game will lose its appeal quickly, with some bomb modules feeling a bit more like a chore than a puzzle.\n\nIf you like party games, snap this right up.

In this game you are given a bomb that you must defuse, with the help of your ally, they cant see your screen, and you cant see the manual; they must guide you through disarming the bomb in the matter of 5 minutes with up to 12 puzzling modules.\n\nI recommend this game to players who have very close friends, as this is a game that tests the trust between one and another, either leaving you in the end closer to that person than you were before; or kicking them out of your life for being poor at helping a friend.\n\nGameplay Here for Reference ►\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vyoCB9Q-c","January 27","true","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I read a Kotaku review of this game and decided to buy it so we can have somthing to do together over skype. That was my first bad idea. The second bad idea was playing this game for 4 hours straight with my girlfriend. Well long story short, I need a new girlfriend to play this game with.\n\nNo seriously this game is great. It really tests your communication skills. Especially because my girlfriend and I have been using skype as a medium for so long its nice to have something to do together(she doesnt play video games....at all). Its very simple(for the gamer, not the person reading the manual), fun and the controlls are very easy. The music could have a little more jump in it but I usally just turn down my music anyway. I wish there was more games like this that my girlfriend and I could play together with just me playing the game and her helping out(if you know any please message me).\n\nMy girlfriend says the manual needs to be clearer, even after I briefly glanced at it i have to agree with her. It is rough and could use color and the font could be slightly bigger. It sort of looks like it has been photocopied. If that was the intention thats fine but there should be a way to make the format changeable\n\nWe do enjoy this game 7/10","October 14, 2015","true","2.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

We've completed more than half of the 'campaign' and had a blast doing it (pun intended, of course)! The mechanics of the game are extremely different from any other game I have played before, allowing for stressful teamwork practice, and brings groups of people together very well. Some of the modules are a little difficult, but as long as you're willing to work on your problems, you can solve them all!\n\nNow, I'm not going to be solely jovial in this review. I do have one predicament that consistently occurs throughout the late-game. It effectively renders this game unplayable, and puts players in the presence of an AIDS-causing, Ebola-inducing, cancerous impass.\n\nMorse code.\n\n♥♥♥♥ this game.\n\nMorse code is quite possibly the worst-developed feature of any puzzle game I have played in my entire 17 years of life. I cannot possibly pontificate the insanity caused by this ♥♥♥♥ing gameplay element! Seriously! What the ♥♥♥♥ were the devs thinking putting in a ♥♥♥♥ing light that blinks in an undecipherable ♥♥♥♥♥how causing all your ♥♥♥♥ing friends to circlejerk around each other until their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ retinas melt. The amount of grief our friends and I have had over this has split our group up, and we are no longer able to function as humans, let alone a cooperative unit.\n\nMy friend David has gone into a deep depression after coming into contact with this devious device of destructive, dissatisfactory disorder. Multiple times have I attempted to converse with him, and he will just repeat "dot dash dash. That's not even in the ♥♥♥♥ing list!". He is unable to bring himself back to sanity as this menacing module has destroyed his hopes in humanity, and for his future.\n\nSincerely ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off,\n\nDicke","April 15","false","6.4"," 16 of 53 people (30%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","30","16","53","22","5"

Not visual. My wife and I really enjoyed this game, except for the morse code modules. The morse code is easy to understand with minimal practice for me. However, my wife has chronically dry eyes. To interpret the morse code modules, you literally cannot blink for, at minimum, 2 letters worth of visual input, which is at a minimum approximately 3 seconds. Any bomb that has morse code, my wife has to turn the monitor to me so that I can interpret the code. If the developer updates the morse code to audio, or some mod comes out to make it audible, then I would absolutely recommend the game.\n\nTL:DR - Visual morse code requires not blinking. This module should be audio based.","March 12","false","18.2"," 29 of 86 people (34%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","34","29","86","4","0"

The first bomb defuser was not a computer expert and so the conversation went like this:\n\nus: cut the last wire!!\nthem: I can't, I don't know how.\nus: idiot! its so easy, just click it.\nthem (frusterated): I AM!! The game doesn't work, nothing works... The bomb just exploded guys...\n\nThis happened for two attempts until we finally decided to investigate. Turns out the game was not taking any mouse input. Some input worked, like you could choose menu's etc, but you could not manipulate the bomb in any way (click, rotate etc).\n\nTo fix we had to Alt-tab. The full screen of black was also fixed by alt-tabbing. It was not clear when this issue would happen so often during game play we would need to alt-tab out of the game and then back in. The requirement to do this was too tedious for the non-computer savvy players and so it forced only one player to be the bomb defuser.\n\nA game with a near perfect score should not have such a debilitating issue.\n\nWe played on a Surface Pro. We played last weekend 11/14/2015.\nI see a patch came out recently that fixed issues with incorrect resolutions. I have not played the game since to see if it was responsible for these issues.","November 19, 2015","false","2.8"," 55 of 415 people (13%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","13","55","415","17","10"

The game is an amazing cooperative game and sincerely amazing to play. Though, most of your steam friends probably don't have this game - nor either know about it. But the thing that sparks me the most about this game is the main menu. You can't see your feet when you look down in the main menu... But the chair moves. How unrealistic. But in all seriousness, without friends this game makes you want to rage, and some of the modules are just complete bull crap. It took me about 3 hours to figure out how complicated wires work, and morse code is just insanely tough. Needy Modules surprisingly aren't that much of an issue. Wire Sequences got me confused too. It took me about an hour to figure that one out. And the worst part - NOW TO TEACH MY FRIENDS. (It's always the wires...) I always forget to check if the serial number has a vowel or not for Simon Says (which is my fault), and some of the "Who's on First" things just always get me. Don't get me started on passwords.\n\nOverall the game is fun with friends, though teaching the complicated stuff about the game will take a super long time - especially practicing with them. They will never figure it out. In fact, you might never figure it out. When I printed out the bomb defusal manual, I literally had to tab each page what they are. I had to literally tape part of a piece of paper to the side of the defusal manual to figure out where stuff is. But the manual is set-up perfectly though, I have to give them credit for that. But if you don't have anyone to play with, then this game is not worth the 14.99, or whatever it is in European-O's. If you have friends, good luck teaching it to them.\n\nI am still gonna play more than 5 hours of the game obviously, and try to complete all of the chapter/tutorial/numbered bombs, and beat the game. The game would be better if it was 9.99, or even 4.99, and yes... just to answer your question (IT WASN'T ON SALE ON THE STEAM SALE HOLIDAYS). (WHICH IS WHEN I BOUGHT IT).\n\n5.8/10 - wait no. As I'm writing this I realized they released it for mac before christmas. Smart idea. Gotta give them credit for that.\n\n6/10 - wait no. VR Support. But doesn't support mac. But not their fault.\n\n6.5/10 - it's an amazing cooperative game, though, could use a global-multiplayer chatting system.\n\n(No, I won't refund it.)","December 27, 2015","false","6.7"," 21 of 268 people (8%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","8","21","268","16","9"

By forcing you to truely work as a team with any number of Manual weilding 'Experts' It'll develop your communication skills, your lateral thinking, your teamwork, your information filtering, and you might even save an orphanage or two.\n\nOnly one of you even needs the game: the PDF manual is available for free online, so for the hours of fun you and some mates are going to have it's pretty amazing value.\n","November 28, 2015","true","28.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Requiring people to think on their toes, effectively relay info quickly, and then act on whatever info they are given. The only downside is the limited number of types of modules and the level of difficulty of some of the later ones.\n\nA good pair will eventually have their own names for different things, or both will study and co-ordinate with each other before hand to help get through modules faster, and this sort of preparation is almost required for sections 5 and onward. One of my friends and myself have printed out the guide, gotten it laminated and bound into a notebook, as well as made different little quick info sheets that are color coded where we can draw/write things given to us from the defuser.\n\nSolving the same kinds of modules over and over can get a little repetetive. Honestly this game would benefit massively from either a major free update for more modules or even a DLC pack with an update to the manual. However I still recommend this title to anyone who wants a good game they can play with a friend over skype or a weird little party game.","November 5, 2015","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you play through the bombs in order and get to switch between defusing and helping someone else defuse, you may fail a couple of times everytime a new module is introduced or less time or strikes are given, but you really don't need to sit down and read through the manual in advance.\n\nThe game is fun and addictive, defusing and helping others to defuse are equally entertaining. The game is also well balanced, so it's challenging but not overwhelming and the progress in difficulty is great!\n\nYou want to have pen and paper, print the manual (a little over 20 pages or so), have a/some friend/s and a way to communicate over distance. That is the only "hassle" you have to go through but it's worth it, specially when the game itself is only 15€ at the moment.\n\n","November 9, 2015","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The object of the game is simple and all the answers are given. What makes this fun is trying to cooperate with your friends to defuse the bomb. In other words, the defuser has to describe each module while the experts ask questions or give the answer. It uses creative aspects to make sure that the game is engaging (Well which word is it? There Their or They're?)(There is an A with a d*ck, a n*tsack, triangle octpus with a T b*ner, and a O with a d*ck). Also works on communication skills between friends and lovers (I'm good at giving you  orders - Mrs. Odd 2k15). On the other note, it can ruin friendships and end in breakups/divorce if you are not communicating properly. And none the less, is playable on an toaster like my computer that can easily run at 60 fps. My hopes and wishes for this game is to either update the game to make more updates for this game (make more modules, add new levels, etc.) and possibly make a sequel.","October 26, 2015","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Finnaly figured out how to prevent it from showing up on the free play mode so it's playable again.  but it is annoying that now I can't go any farther on the regular mode that light just blinks way to fast and while I can tell the dots from the dashes I can't tell where the end of the letter is or comunicate that with out already missing most of the info for the next letter.  I'd still recomend this game as in freeplay mode with the morse code turned off in the accessbitly settings, this game is rather fun.  but if I was giving it point rating I'd still give it a low one for making that module required to play the rest of the game. heck even if I had to push a button to advace to the next letter that would be way better then it just running them all together like it does.\n\nso to recap the freeplay mode is great fun once you get the accessbily settings setup properly, and if you got a friend or a group of fiends to play it with then it's fun.  but the rest of the game I wouldn't recomend because the morse code puzzle is way off the diffculty curve and shows up pretty early on, and then is in most bombs there after. Also there is no player matching system so if you don't got at least one friend willing to play it with you then you can't play it the way it was designed to be played.","December 4, 2015","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's something so wonderful about defusing the bomb before it explodes and something equally wonderful about hearing your sister say "Noooooooooooooooooooooooooo!" when you blow it for her.

It's intelligent, it keeps people on their feet, and it evolves flawlessly from being absolutely hilarious in the early stages to bringing out feelings of both tension and accomplishment once you really get into it.\n\nThis quickly became my favorite local co-op game of all time, as I can't think of anything that even compares. If someone knows of any, let me know because damn...if there are other games this good, I need to know about them.\n\nThe game works extremely well with various numbers of players; I've played with 2, 3, and 4 and it worked well each time. Just be aware that the more people you have working with the manual, the more downtime there will be for each of them (if that's even a bad thing..). The game is more suited for splitting up tasks than it is for collaborating on all of the tasks (except maybe in the beginning while everyone is figuring things out), but that by no means hinders the inevitable sense of teamwork. This really is a team-driven game. Everyone needs to rely on everyone else doing their jobs quickly and correctly.\n\nMy only concern is replayability. Don't get me wrong, its replayability is theoretically very solid, for several reasons: (1) there are portions of the game that would be ridiculous to memorize, (2) the bomb is randomized to a degree each time you repeat a level, and (3) you are able to play with custom time limits and complexity. I just hope, with all my heart, that the developers put the time in to develop other versions of the manual over time. There is soooo much potential here for future development, it would kill me to see it go to waste. Fingers crossed!","November 26, 2015","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The only bad part about the game is that you DO need a friend who is willing to sit there and read to you on how to defuse the bomb.

I brought this game to a party, and had a blast playing with a bunch of different people. The fact that one team plays with a physical bomb defusing manual means that anyone who is curious about the game can watch and participate without any pressure.\n\nThe game also works well with Oculus Rift: being isolated in VR helps the person defusing the bomb feel isolated and impedes non-verbal communication from teammates. I was also impressed by how well the difficulty scales, given that you learn more and more of the manual by heart.\n\nIf you've got a few friends to play with, definitely check out this explooosive party game!","January 9","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is best played by players with equal experience with the game, and even more so when those players' experience is ZERO.\n\nYou probably know the concept by the fact that you are here at all, but briefly, one player has to defuse a bomb on the screen with no instructions, and the other player(s) have access to a manual as to how to defuse this bomb, and the only way you can win is by communication.\n\nI haven't played for long, but despite this game having a free play mode so you can play with endless bombs of any difficulty, I worry that once you've memorised the manual, this game will become more of a speed run than the the coop gameplay that really makes it special...\n\nHowever, the manual is specifically listed as 'Version 1', and so I have high hopes that it will change to keep the game fresh for much much longer. I do not know if this will be via DLC or just regular changes to the formula for free, but either way I am excited, because then, there is always the possibility for uncertainty and failure in the future, even for veterans!\n\nHighly recommended game, it's the perfect party game, it's more like a board game than most videogames, in the best possible way, using technology to it's advantage, similar to how the Jackbox Party Pack uses devices most people own to make it super accessible, when you could have that sort of quiz game with cards and scoreboards, yet it's even better when enhanced by today's technology.","October 11, 2015","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
