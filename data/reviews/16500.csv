I don’t even know where to start.\n\nSo the object of the game is to wait for some colored dots to spawn, then click on a variety of stationary tools to get them to fly into receptor objects. Sometimes the dots will fly wildly all over the screen until you activate magnets to suck them up. Other times they will break or decay and need to re-spawn. Yet other times they don’t respawn, so if you mess up the puzzle you need to start all over. There are a few good ideas, but what game doesn’t have a few good ideas? Here, it’s completely destroyed by a large number of issues:\n\n* Non-deterministic physics. When I first played the game, the introductory level told me to “just watch.” Then physics glitched out and two particles collided when they should not have, breaking the level and leaving me staring at the screen until I realized I had to restart. Things didn’t get much better from there.\n\n* Most of the puzzles don’t involve planning, but having highly precise aim and timing. This is “I know what I need to do, but it’s taking me two hundred tries to do it: the game”\n\n* Solved the puzzle? – Great, now you have to do it again. Four times. For some reason, clearing most stages requires you to repeat the exact same actions several times in a row, usually four times, sometimes more. All the while, the physics could glitch out at any time and require a restart.\n\n* The only texture in the game is the space background. White textureless models are hard on the eyes and make it difficult to distinguish between different objects.\n\n* Twitch-reaction solutions are very frustrating when they require quickly clicking on multiple tiny objects.\n\n* Camera controls are a joke; the camera and the game can’t be controlled at the same time, and it resets at the beginning of every level.\n\n* The only music is a few 12-second ambient loops. Sounds are unremarkable. (The voice-overs for the tutorials were decent, though)\n\n* It is impossible to play this game in full-screen if you have multiple monitors, it will crash instantly. You need to edit a config file just to let it run.\n\nIn short, this game is irritating, obtuse, unrewarding, glitchy, and visually awful.\n\nOn the bright side, I got all of the achievements in under 5 hours… so if you’re an achievement hunter, go for it, just don’t expect to have much fun.","April 21, 2015","false","4.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","5","5","2","0"

My only complaint is that there are not enough maps.  Although there are player made maps, it just isn't the same.","May 26, 2014","true","14.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has nothing do with stealth. It's puzzle game about particles and magnetism.\n\nYour task is to make the particles reach their destination. Red have to end up at red collector and green have to end up in a green collector. That's the logic of the game. The game introduces you new mechanics and teaches how to use tools. The mechanics are based on forces of magnetism. In order to finish the map you have to use properly distributors, rotator, plarity inverters just to mention a few. Timing and thinking ahead is important. Sometimes direction you shoot particles has meaning.\n\nThe game doens't feature any rewind/quicksave/checkpoint system, so you have to finish a level in one go. Since this game belongs to the group of trial and error games you will often spend long time repeating levels. Some of them require speed, some timing and some require planning. Later levels combine all of those.\nAdditionally you can't speed up certain actions - you just have to wait... zzz. You are waiting and waiting, and you don't want to carry on. I just don't have patience for it. Let me do it.\n\nThe presentation is average. There are very few options. Graphics is basic, so is the sound. On the other end music is pleasant. It's strange, but fits the game perfectly.\n\nThe repetitive nature of the game as well as lack of mid-level save system made me quit playing it. I found that too tiresome. Repeating things over and over. Meh... This and the fact I was stuck in a few levels with no clue how to solve them made me quit the game. It's not a bad game, but I guess I lost interest and my patience didn't let me finish. Since I can't really recommend it, so I'm giving it thumbs down.\n","December 21, 2014","false","8.5"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"
