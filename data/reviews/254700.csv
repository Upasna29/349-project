This review is also available in video format if you scroll down.)\n\nNine years have passed since Resident Evil 4’s initial release on the GameCube and it still holds up quite well. It’s a massively influential game that helped pioneer the third person shooter genre as well as completely changed the face of survival horror.\n\nYou’ll once again fill the shoes of Leon Kennedy as he searches for the President's missing daughter, Ashley, in a remote area of Spain. She’s being held by a mysterious cult, known as the Los Illuminados who are utilizing a mind-controlling parasite called Las Plagas in order to gain power. The village that Leon first comes across is filled with infected townsfolk aptly named Ganado or “herd” in English, who are hell-bent on stopping Leon.\n\nResident Evil 4 continues the tradition of offering an eccentric and ridiculous narrative that successfully links some of the franchise's biggest characters to its events but also stands well enough on its own that newcomers are not left scratching their heads.\n\nThe controls are solid and responsive but may feel somewhat strange to those that are accustomed to modern third person shooters. Leon is unable to move and shoot at the same time and must remain stationary when aiming. The camera also obscures a lot of your surroundings, adding to the overall tension and horror.\n\nWhen it comes to the gameplay and combat, the Plagas-infected enemies present a satisfying challenge. They will relentlessly pursue Leon, often trying to flank him. Removing an enemies’ head will often just allow the Plagas themselves to emerge and engage Leon directly or swing around from the host’s neck. The enemies react appropriately to each wound, dropping their weapons or stumbling rewarding your aim with purpose and control. Shield bearing cult members and blind mutants with massive claws that must be dispatched by killing the parasites on their backs also refresh the enemy roster. Several satisfying boss fights provide the cherry on top of the Resident Evil 4 gameplay experience. It also features a great inventory management and upgrade system, allowing you to customize various weapons to suit your play style.\n\nThe greater focus on action does mean that scares are less frequent than they were in previous entries. Wandering around a hedge maze with Plagas infested wolves waiting to jump out of bushes and seeking keys whilst being pursued by wheezing, seemingly unstoppable regenerators are some of Resident Evil 4's few terrifying highlights during its three acts. While the first two acts are brilliantly executed, the third act loses a bit of momentum at parts, focusing more on action opposed to horror. This handful of minor grimace worthy moments is largely lost amidst the rest of the experience which will take most players fifteen or more hours on their first playthrough.\n\nAs if the main campaign wasn't long enough, Assignment Ada offers additional content as a mini game through the third act where you collect five samples of the Las Plagas parasite. Mercenaries mode challenges players to survive and kill as many enemies as possible. It's an addictive mode that would go on to become a staple of the franchise by enticing players with a risk/reward system, stringing together kills gives players a multiplier and breaking hourglasses extends the time of the session, providing a greater opportunity to post a high score.  It’s a challenging variant on the gameplay that requires mastery of each stage to unlock further content and rewards. With these additional modes, it's really easy to get thirty hours of entertainment from Resident Evil 4. If that’s not enough, there’s also a Separate Ways campaign which acts as a mini scenario B filling in Ada’s perspective of the story with new bosses, viewpoints and a new area to complete substantially fleshing out the story.\n\nThe muted, earth tone rich Spanish village that serves as Resident Evil 4's setting is a massive departure from the dark, claustrophobic and sinister mansion from the first game and the post-apocalyptic city scape of the second and third games. When it was first released, Resident Evil 4 was one of the most impressive graphical showcases of the Playstation 2 and Gamecube. With a 1080p resolution, a frame rate of 60 FPS and some rescaled textures, Resident Evil 4 looks better than ever. It still looks its age but is still capable of impressing. The atmosphere is as rich in 2014 as it was in 2005 but it's still the same game and some low-res textures can be found.\n\nResident Evil 4 is a bittersweet experience, along with Half-Life 2, it helped foreshadow what was to come with new hardware as well as perfectly reinvigorating and updating a franchise that was in danger of losing its appeal as new hardware changed gamers expectations. In doing so however, Resident Evil 4 shifted the franchise's inertia toward action and with the next couple installments; Resident Evil would almost entirely forsake its horror roots. With the death of Resident Evil as a horror game, much of the survival horror genre fell into mediocrity with Dead Space being one of the few titles to successfully straddle the line between action and horror before becoming a victim of the same fate.\n\nResident Evil 4 is one of the greatest games of the new millennium. It maintained enough of the elements of its predecessors to be identifiable as a Resident Evil game while otherwise reinventing the franchise. Its timeless gameplay, great art direction and mostly excellent bosses make it very playable almost a decade after its original release. If you haven't played Resident Evil 4, now is as good a time as any.\n\n\nTLDR? This review is also available in video format (I did the editing while my friend Josh handled the voice over):\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv0UuIVS9Nw\n\nWe also had a two hour discussion on Resident Evil after playing Resident Evil 6. We cover things like our favorite moments from the franchise as well as what changes we’d like to see in the future:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I243Zqf64bU\n\nPros:\n\n+ A solid port, Resident Evil 4 looks better than ever at 1080p and 60FPS.\n+ Amazing gameplay & enemy reactions\n+ Excellent Atmosphere & Environments\n+ Fantastic inventory and upgrade system\n+ Good balance of horror and action\n+ Great additional content\n\nCons:\n\n- Somewhat weaker third act\n- Irritating Ashley AI\n- The beginning of the end (The success of Resident Evil 4 lead to the franchise shifting more towards the action side of things.)\n\n\nNote: A controller is strongly recommended. It also seems that quite a few people with AMD/ATI Processors and video cards have been experiencing some slow-down. I haven't had any technical difficulties running the game but I'm running an Intel I5 3570k and a GTX560TI. I imagine this issue will be patched shortly though for those experiencing it.\n\nOverall, Resident Evil 4 is a solid port and a must play. The 60 FPS is actually extremely noticeable when compared to the Xbox 360 and PS3 HD releases of the game, making it feel smoother than ever.\n\n\nIf you enjoyed this review, feel free to follow me as a Steam Curator: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/4886473/","February 27, 2014","true","7.1"," 490 of 589 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","490","589","0","26"

It will make your life so much easier.\n\nPro - The character models for the most part look very nice. Capcom has updated the models to make them sharper, crispier, and added new textures.\n- The framerate is now in 60FPS\n-Has all the extra from the re-releases of the game\n-Great texture mods are available (or will be)\n-Same great gameplay from 2005\n-1080p\n\nCon - Motion blur is beyond terrible,I highly recommend that you turn it off ASAP.\n-Only about 10% of the game has HD textures, the other 90% are old textures with a filter over it (2xSAL)\n-No new extras\n-You can't aim and walk (not an issue for me but might annoy you)\n-Tank controls (not an issue for me)\n-Might not run great on certain computers (runs fine on mine, GTX 880M, i7-4810MQ 2.8Ghz)\n\n\nVerdict\n-Overall, this is a great version of Resident Evil 4. I don't think Capcom has a reason to release this game again unless they are doing a full "HD" version (100% updated graphics, lighting, updated controls, ect..), but I am sure this will be the "final" version.\n-If you love RE4 or have never played it, then I highly suggest buying this game. This is one of the greatest video games of all time. It revolutionized the 3rd person shooter.\n- I am pretty disappointed at the "HD" in the title (it is a little misleading), but this is the "definite" version of RE4.","October 17, 2014","true","46.2"," 189 of 206 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","189","206","4","2"

I shouldn't be so unnecessarily harsh on them though because this is a vast improvement over the original PC release that I still think has the dubious honor of being the most trashiest console to PC port in all of console to PC port memory. The less said about the original port - published by Ubisoft - the better and if you haven't had the chance of experiencing it lets just say it was a hot-mess!\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=258832138\nAfter seven years Capcom have finally decided to do right by PC owners but their attempts still leave a lot be desired. While the original had no mouse/keyboard support to speak of I can't say its been incredibly well implemented in this newer version. You are still better of, I am afraid, plugging in a controller to get proper mileage out of this title. As for the HD textures upgrade, while there is a slight noticeable difference, it appears as if very little work went into retooling them as they simply look as if they have been up-scaled to higher resolutions that most PC games support these days. So if you were expecting a complete graphical overhaul then you are going to come away disappointed I am afraid.\n\nAs for the 60 fps selling point - this is one area where the game does benefit greatly and should run spectacularly on most modern machines where the original PC port was prone to stuttering frames that were all over the show. As for the menus - they are pretty much still a mess with no way of exiting the title unless you die and decide not to continue. This is the only time you will get to a menu that will actually allow you to exit the title. This frustrated me in the original PC release and I can't fathom out why it's making yet another appearance in the 2014 edition of the game. Some of the cut-scenes also appear to have been lifted straight from the original PC port with very little done to clear up the terrible haziness they are presented in.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=257425038\nAs for the actual game it's still the classic that we all know and love although to be fair its starting to show signs of its age now. When I played this on the original Gamecube I was not entirely bothered that the game was basically one long escort mission but subsequent implementations in other games have made me hate this kind of setup because for the majority they have been incredibly badly implemented impeding the player more that empowering them. To be fair, Ashely, the Presidents daughter Leon S, Kennedy is sent in to retrieve after she is abducted by a cult with dubious reasons for world domination, does generally stay out of the way and is pretty good at avoiding the enemies but every so often she would end up being the reason I had to replay a section and that frustrated me more than it did back in 2005 or 2007 when I played the original PC port. Inventory management is another area where the game looks a bit archaic as the player is constantly taken out of the action to equip another weapon or use a health vial or spray. Also inventory management is almost a game in itself with the player playing a tetris-like game with the items you collect.\n\nLeon S, Kennedy is a great protagonist though, wading through this adventure with so many cheesy one-liners that I couldn't help but smile. The game is still an action-fest romp (I would hesitate to call this title scary or terrifying) that manages to get quite tense at certain points in the game. Resident Evil 4 is also where the series started to show its cinematic ambitions. Thankfully things are not so overblown in Resident Evil 4 as they subsequently got in the latter releases. Resident Evil 4 strikes a nice balance that has been sorely lacking from the future releases that would come after.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=257502778\nSo is it worth dipping your foot back into these waters if you have played almost all of the releases for this title on various systems? Well that is for you to decide. If you loved this game back in the day I would say definitely. It's a great piece of nostalgia. Personally I still feel the asking price is a little too high considering the games age and what you are actually getting in this "Ultimate" edition. Capcom would have benefited by setting this title at $14.99. If you haven't yet taken the Resident Evil 4 plunge you may wonder at the end of the day what all the fuss was about but you have to remember Resident Evil 4 was the first game to introduce the over the shoulder viewpoint which was pretty landmark at the time and would go on to influence many other titles - one such being the Gears of War franchise. So for both newcomers to the title and veterans alike I wouldn't hesitate recommending the game but just be aware what you are ULTIMATELY getting.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","May 12, 2014","true","19.4"," 161 of 197 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","161","197","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/geoluz/recommended/254700/","geoluz","GeoLuz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/geoluz/","180 products in account","Resident Evil 4 was released in 2005 for GameCube and was later released on other platforms. It looks like Capcom wanted to significantly improve its visuals for the second PC port as the first PC port was released in 2007. The graphics are sharper than ever and the gameplay is very good, although a few small problems exist.\n\nThis game has been enhanced for 1080p resolution at 60FPS. There is keyboard and mouse support with the ability to customize the keys. Resident Evil 4 HD comes with the Separate Ways campaign to increase replay value. The keyboard and mouse work very well together, but sometimes the laser targeting is not perfect and that can lead to problems when there are multiple enemies near you or when a large boss monster is approaching.\n\nThe plot of the game begins with the kidnapping of Ashley Graham, the daughter of the president of the United States. Leon Kennedy, the well-known protagonist of the series, has been sent to a village in Spain to rescue Ashley. What happens in the Spanish village is that there is a religious cult that has released an ancient parasite called Las Plagas on to the countryside. The religious cult does not consist of zombies like other Resident Evil games. You begin fighting ganados, a group of foes who carry pitchforks and are both males and females. Later, you will meet darker and tougher foes known as cultists, religious zealots who wear red or black robes.\n\nAs Leon progresses through the story, there will be memos explaining the plan of the cult known as the Illuminados. These memos keep you well informed of the plot and it seems to get darker and darker. The environments are appropriately creepy as Leon looks for Ashely. Resident Evil 4 retains the series’ history of creepy and dark locales. There are misty forests, decrepit houses, moldy caverns, a large castle, and military facilities. The locales display diversity so that there is no monotony. Leon is joined by other characters like Luis Sera and the Ada Wong. Luis Sera is a local citizen who is willing to help Leon. Leon engages in a long shooting with the ganados while Mr. Sera helps out in this long battle. Ada Wong is a familiar figure to Resident Evil fans and has had a long relationship with Leon. There are bits and pieces of the script that indicate past romances and rivalries. However, the plot keeps you at the edge of your seat at all times, which is the way it should be for a Resident Evil game.\n\nThe graphical enhancements of the diverse locales are what make this game feel like it is not so old. The details of Leon, his allies, and enemies are impressively sharp and well defined. The walls of the castle look extremely realistic. You can see the dust falling from the ceiling of caverns that make the caverns both realistic and creepy. The textures look amazing in high resolution, but in some cases they look a little bit archaic and out of place. However, the details of the textures are sharp enough to outweigh any archaic look you may find. Military facilities make you feel like that there is a nasty experiment going on while it also feels abandoned.\n\nThe bosses are diverse and require you to figure out their main weaknesses in order to defeat them. One issue that pops up in boss battles and in other parts of the game is the quick time events. Sometimes you have to press two buttons at once very quickly to avoid key attacks or avoid deadly traps. It can feel awkward trying to press the X + C keys or the two mouse buttons while using the WASD keys in tense circumstances. While it is appropriate to have tense circumstances in a Resident Evil game, it can get frustrating trying to press two keys at once but dying in the process because of you are not able to press the buttons in time. Another issue that comes up is the laser targeting of the firearms. There are times when the laser targeting takes time to be accurate while one or more enemies are quickly approaching you. Also, the laser can twitch in the spur of the moment, leading to more difficult encounters with the various types of enemies and possible waste of ammo. Ammo is always at a premium in the game, so twitching is a bad thing in a game like this.\n\nAll firearms can be upgraded by visiting the various merchants that stand around waiting for you. Upgrading your weapons will make your shots noticeably more powerful. You can upgrade your weapons to the max so that you can be an “exclusive” weapon that will be far more powerful than the weapon you fully upgraded. The challenge is to find the pesetas scattered throughout the locales and dropped by the enemies. You will have to quite a bit of searching for pesetas and treasures with lots of value if you want to upgrade any of your firearms to the max.\n\nThere is some randomness when it comes to shooting enemies, especially in the head. Some ganados and cultists will simply fall to their deaths with a headshot. Other enemies will show their Plagas, spider-like figures that emerge from their necks, and continue to try to attack you. You can either fire a shotgun at their Plagas or use a flash grenade to finally finish them off. There are encounters that require crowd control, so you can use different types of grenades to bring some relief to these tense encounters.\n\nOther enemies that are interesting and horrific include garradores, colmillos, and regenerators. The garradores do not attack unless they hear your sound and are blind. Their only weakness is the Plagas shown on their backs. Colmillos are terrifying dogs that can jump on top of you by surprise. Regenerators are special monstrosities in that you can only use a sniper rifle with an infrared scope to locate and shoot their Plagas on their torso.\n\nResident Evil 4 is worth playing for its diverse locations, creepy atmosphere, and tense encounters. The nail biting gameplay lives up to what Resident Evil fans expect from a Resident Evil game. The high resolution graphics make the PC version the definitive version to play.\n\nMy Score: 8.5/10","August 11, 2015","true","86.2"," 104 of 120 people (87%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","87","104","120","7","0"

For those that played the game back on the GameCube or PS2, everything is still here and better than ever. Those that are new, enjoy a game that is both action oriented, and horror inducing in all the best ways.\n[ + ] Gameplay is great. While common nowadays, back in 2005 the third person view with close in laser aim was revolutionary, and games like Dead Space and Evil Within owe thanks to this game. Something else I believed RE4 popularized was QTE's, which are used quite frequently throughout the game. I was never a fan of QTE's, and while this game had it's good ones, there were plenty of bad ones as well.\n\n[ + ] Graphics, like the gameplay, were amazing back in '05. That being said this game still looks great thanks to the HD port. 1080p with 60 FPS on top of HD textures really help the game look in its prime condition. Animations are also something I look for while playing games, and Capcom did a great job in making everything move and look like it should.\n\n[ + ] Plot surprisingly good. Older RE games focused on two things, survive and escape. While RE4 doesn't mess with that formula, it does change it up some. Leon being tasked with rescuing the President's daughter, is on a hunt to find her in rural Europe, then find a way out once that task is completed. The main / side characters I found to be interesting, while a couple others do get annoying as the game goes on.\n\n[ + ] Atmosphere holds true to the RE games, and really brings in something new of its own from the very beginning. From woods, to villages, to castles, to an island, they all give off the same creepy vibe of something not being right. You'll encounter scary enemies, fight tough bosses, solve puzzles, and fight to stay alive. Keeping true to the series.\n\n[ + ] Sound is standard in this game. The guns sound good, enemies sound scary, and music is average. But the save room music in this game, like all RE games is so...mystic and mesmerizing. It’s hard to describe and really stands out that much to me, giving me an eerily safe feeling before heading back out into that dangerous unknown.\n\n[ + ] AI is good. While Ashley's character is generally seen as an annoyance, she does well to stick close by you and never stray far when danger is close. That doesn't make her any less annoying, but, there's at least no unnecessary frustration. Enemies are actually pretty smart too. They'll move out of the way to avoid getting shot, and will dodge, leap, and climb to get to you.\n\n[ - ] Puzzles got dumbed down this time around. This was intentional I believe, since the game was going more run and gun, rather than stop and think. There are quite a few puzzles in the game, but only two I found to be challenging. The rest involved simply finding an item or pushing a button to open whatever door / path that blocked the way.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs a kid, this was the first horror game I managed to beat on my own. The reason behind that was because even though this game was scary to me, it was so fun I had to push through and finish it. I went on to beat it over 50 more times on my old GameCube version. A truly great game, and one that should be played by the avid gamer, along with the other classic RE games.\n","December 28, 2015","true","40.1"," 77 of 83 people (93%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","93","77","83","10","0"

Alright, if you insist.\n\nI reckon most of you are already familiar with this title from one of the previous releases. For those who aren't, well let's just say the trailer didn't lie about it being one of the highest rated games in history. Even if it has been nine years now, it still manages to retain the entertainment aspect. Speaking of this port in particular however, it is a much needed improvement over the previous release. The only thing I was disappointed with was that mouse aim isn't exactly responsive or so you will think when you first attempt to play the game while making use of a mouse. But truth is it just takes some time to get used to. If it was done any other way the game would be far too easy considering the nine year old AI's capabilities or more precisely lack of such.\n\nBut here's what you really are reading this for...\nAs far as ports go everything is top notch in terms of technical execution!\nJust as with all the previous Resident Evil ports that have been done by Capcom themselves.\n\nEDIT: Turns out the issue with the 60 FPS arose from the fact that it had used my integrated card which I didn't even consider because the game was running perfectly fine unless switched to 60 FPS.

It was in development for a really long time, shifted between completely different concepts and almost ended up scrapped a few times.\n\nYet it pulled through, and became one of the most notable action games of the 6th generation. I say action game because that was what made Resi 4 so good.\n\nResi 4 does not take place in the 'states like it's predecessors. Nor do you ever fight zombies. Instead you fight infected villagers. The dev team actually did this in a very unique way. Because of how the game employs a manual aiming system, firing at different body parts produces different reactions from enemies. Like you can stumble an enemy running at you by shooting him in the legs. This provides immense amounts of strategy to fighting enemies. Adding to that enemies will work together and use the environment against you.\n\nThe atmosphere was extraordinary, the enemies were engaging and the combat was slick and new. Resi 4 might have not aged very well in the last 10 years, but it still leaves an impact that lasts a long time.","April 26, 2014","true","11.6"," 86 of 98 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","86","98","2","3"

Oh, Mr. Kennedy, you entertain me! To show my appreciation, I will help you awaken from your world of clichés!\n\nStory Six years have passed since the viral outbreak in Raccoon City. The Umbrella Corporation has gone bankrupt due to a crash in stock sales after it is revealed that they are to blame for the incident. Leon S. Kennedy, one of the few survivors of the Raccoon City outbreak, has been trained by the U.S. special forces to protect the president of America and his family. Only on his first day Leon is send to a remote village is Spain, to find the kidnapped daughter of the president. When Leon arrives here he finds out that the villagers of this once peaceful place have turned into mindless 'Ganados', with a strange cult called "The Los Illuminados" controlling the villagers. Now Leon must find and rescue the president's daughter and uncover a plot that could lead to ultimate global destruction.\n\nGameplay Unlike its predecessors Resident Evil 4 is an over the shoulder third person action game, with a little bit of survival-horror here and there. Like the other games, you can't walk and shoot at the same time, which for many newcomers might seem annoying but actually makes for a lot of tense moments while fighting the games many enemies. The game is split into three parts and five chapters. With the last part being a bit weaker than the previous two, it's still amazing. The game has a few boss battles, which are all very tense and satisfying to battle. The unlocked Professional mode, is a though challenge, but a lot of fun for hardcore gamers.\n\nConclusion As you can see by the hours that I've played this game, I love it. I played all the Resident Evil games and Resident Evil 4 is the one that made me play all of them. For many Resi "purists" this was the death of the series, because of its more action focused gameplay. But for me and many other gamers Resident Evil 4 was a phenomenal game. The story has a fun "B-Movie" vibe to it, and the gameplay does need some getting used to, is still a lot of fun once you learned how to control it.\n\n9.5/10","January 19, 2015","true","121.3"," 60 of 70 people (86%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","86","60","70","6","0"

Still, the series needed a breath of fresh air around when it was released and it updates the combat mechanics of the game while not making it too much like any other shooter game with monsters. It usually pulls off feeling challenging but fair, although there are a few cheap parts where you are almost guaranteed to mess up at least once.\n\nThe story remains captivating throught the game and serves its purpose of keeping the player engaged although there are a few instances of "cutscene stupidity" (mostly involving a certain girl getting captured...multiple times...).\n\nThere's also a fair bit a latitute as far as weapons go once you get futher into the game, with a variety of pistols, shotguns, rifles and some more specialized weapons you can choose from to suit your playstyle. Each of them has certain strengths and weaknesses that can be exploited.\n\nAs always, the music stays true to the series standard of setting the mode of each area, becoming mysterious, nervous and frantic at the appropriate times (and of course, some of the most disturbing segements are when it ceases playing entirely).\n\nMy biggest compaint is probably the overuse of quicktime events both within and outside of cutscenes. This is a personal pet peeve of mine, and I think they often mar some otherwise great games. Sometimes this is tastefully employed in RE 4; however, there is one particular scene late in the game that reveals important information concerning the plot which is basically one continous quicktime event. Suffice to say, if you keep dieing during the same scene it gets old fast. It's pretty safe to say that if you enter a cutscene, you need to be ready to hit buttons " just in case."\n\nUltimately, RE 4 is a great game, even if it doesn't follow exactly in the spirit of the earlier titles (although argubably, with 5 and 6 out now that spirit is now irrevocably changed anyway). For instance, you didn't feel like an complte badass like Leon S. Kennedy apparently is with his acrobatics and roundhouse kicks:  each and every foe could mean death in 1-3, while this is only a concern with largish groups of the common mooks in 4. This totally changed the dynamic of the game, and yet 4 somehow still makes it work enough to not completely drain the game of suspense. I've heard 5 and 6 are not nearly as success at this, but I can't speak for them since I haven't played through those (yet).\n\nIn my mind, I tend to think of 4 as a worthy game that stands on its own and not relate it overly much to the originals except for certain minor plot and references that, honestly, aren't even neccearry and wouldn't even effect the value of the game that much if they weren't there if you think about it honestly (other than to retain the title "Resident Evil"). For what it is, I enjoy it as one of my favorite all-time action-adventures/horror games (9 out of 10).","November 23, 2014","true","53.6"," 43 of 48 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","43","48","3","1"

This is one of the best games ever made.\n\nSee? Easy peasy fo' sheezy. Millions of people know that this game is totally great, and it's a waste of everyone's time for me to write a long review. Still, I feel obligated to write SOMETHING, because RE4 is that damn good.\n\nRE4 is nearly 10 years old now, and it only seems to get better with age. It's a third-person shooter that has managed to carve out the perfect identity. It's the definition of a classic. But why is that? What is it that RE4 does so well that makes it a genre-defining masterpiece?\n\nLet's start with something basic, sound-direction. One of the most basic ideas RE4 has is that when enemies are nearby, music plays. When the music stops, that means all of the enemies are dead. This is the moment when you can release that tension. RE4 is also one of those games where you're actively harming yourself by playing music over the in-game tunes. Your view is very limited, and all you really have to keep track of your surroundings are your ears. This isn't something you'll notice in RE5 or RE6 because 95% of the time you have a partner. In RE4 your ears are going to pick up every grunt, every foot-step, every little noise, and it's going to save your life.\n\nSpeaking of partners, I honestly think Ashley is underrated. Yeah ok "LEEEOOOOOOOOOOON" gets obnoxious, but it's to be expected. This girl is way out of her element, and protag is the only person she can trust(and vice-versa I suppose, if you don't count the merchant). There's all sorts of little moments that make her welcome company. Whenever you do something cool like shoot a hatchet out of the air, she does a little fist-pump. If there is an enemy behind you, she's going to notice. She serves as a good distraction, is quick to get behind you or duck under your gun. The most dangerous areas also tend to leave nice places for Ashley to hide. Still, I dunno...maybe I just appreciate when she's around. It's like I'm getting a psychological buff. It's easy to forget that with all the ♥♥♥ Leon is kicking, that the situation he and Ashley are in is well and truly screwed. Any moment where it feels like things are going right is worth holding onto.\n\nThe controls and mechanics still hold up perfectly. While having all the cool diving moves in RE6 is really nice, there's something to be said about methodically evading all sorts of stuff by walking ever so slightly to the side and/or backwards. It really gives you a feel of just how much weight goes into each encounter. Movement is just so focused and creates the right amount of context. Where you stand determines so much of the enemy's behavior.  It's like an arcade beatemup. Sure you can walk right up and punch everyone, but you're bound to take a bunch of damage in the process. The trick is to move around enough so that your foes are "herded". They're in the right position and distance for you to deal with them appropriately. Losing track of enemies is dangerous, because they could get behind you, approach your sides, and then it's back to relying on your ears as well as your eyes to restore some sort of order.\n\nThere's a lot to be said about making do with what you're given, which is where RE4 also shines. A lot of shooters have to push the "variety" angle to keep encounters interesting. There's always a new type of enemy, different victory conditions, or just some gimmick. Much of RE4 is spent in combat, and these combat situations are typically Leon in an area surrounded by enemies. Early on he has to rely on blocking doors, throwing down ladders, just to keep enemies at bay. As his arsenal improves he's expected to take fight directly to the enemy, also relying on his advanced maneuverability to stay one step ahead. When old doors close, new ones open, that's what keeps a game engaging, not doing something different at every moment. RE4 knows exactly when to create moments that are actually special, not just different. They're memorable, but unless you're replaying the game you won't have to deal with them again. Whether it's just business as usual or these special moments, the core mechanics and design of RE4 are front and center. It's astonishing just how well Capcom/Mikami gets it.\n\nRE4 also features one of the best campaigns of any time. I'd say it's at just the right length. Some would claim that the game runs a bit too long, and that some parts could trimmed or even cut entirely. This is not something I can agree with.  Nothing really feels wasted in this game. Like okay there's a kinda dumb moment where you use a crane to drop enemies into the garbage disposal. This part of the game follows shortly after discovering the regenerators and (hopefully) finding the means to destroy them. Having a goofy little moment where you toss a few las plagas in the garbage is...kinda nice. Pacing isn't always just pushing for everything to move as quickly as possible. Even very late in the game RE4 has time to throw ideas around. Unfortunately, this probably says more about the rushed nature that game development is all too easy prey for. The end levels tend to be pushed together. The only intention is that hopefully everything doesn't fall apart. RE4 had seemingly all the time in the world to get everything right and it shows.\n\nBack to what I said about the perfect identity. First off, no disrespect to RE5 and RE6. I really enjoy and love those games as well, but they're not RE4. What makes this game such a classic is not something that can be replicated. Even if you could somehow get prime Mikami and top-of-their-game-era Capcom together again and tasked them with doing a 1:1 sequel to RE4, you'd still end up with a lesser title. RE4 is a product of its time, it has limitations, and in a way it makes those into strengths. Sure I'd be curious to see how RE4 part 2 would play with RE6 controls, but it wouldn't be the same.  I guess conceptually it'd be an improvement, but in practice...I don't think it could work. Leon dashing around like he was in a zombie-infested Vanquish sequel? Yeah not feeling that either.\n\nAnyway to sum it all up, play through RE4 again. Appreciate it like you never have before. We'll never see another game quite like it.","September 27, 2014","true","14.2"," 39 of 43 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","39","43","4","0"

I hope you find it useful as to whether or not to purchase this game!\n\nI should probably make it clear that this is the only version of the game I have played. I have had no experience with any other versions, and one of the first games I purchased after finishing my new build. I was at first a bit skeptical about buying Resident Evil 4. It didn't seem like the type of game I would be interested in. It's old, cheesy (as I found out as I played), and referred to as the game which killed the series. Because of this, I never really considered to play it. I thought it would be a waste of time, money, and an overall dissapointment.\n\nI was wrong. I was so extremely wrong.\n\nTo be honest, I don't really know why I even bought this masterpiece. I never do spend much, so it felt strange purchasing this. (Actually, it was the drought of 2014 which probably did it! And don't worry, Shadow of Mordor, you're an exception!) Anyway, I jumped right into the game right after it finished downloading. At first, It felt really strange. The controls felt awkward, even with the use of my Xbox 360 controller. Only a few minutes in, and I was thrown into the action. I felt vulnerable and angry that the camera never really seemed to do what I wanted it to. After dying several times by means of an axe to the face, a pitchfork from behind, and of course, those God forsaken bear traps, I finally made it to this quaint village in "rural europe" which totally in no way seems familiar to Spain on any degree whatsoever, only to meet dozens of infected villagers and chainsaw guy. From that moment on, I absolutely fell in love.\n\nEvery shot, suplex, ridiculous one liner, and plagas made me love it more and more. So much that I completed it again, and again, and again, and some more. Sure, It doesn't have the graphical fidelity of modern games today, or an amazing story to go along with it. But my God, it is FUN.\n\nWell, I guess this wasn't really a great review, or a review at all. Just a love letter to one of my favorite games of all time. I know I didn't cover all aspects of the game and how much it got right (pacing, for example), but by know I think you probably got an idea how I feel about Resident Evil 4. If you haven't bought this game by now, I strongly urge you to do so, and a Pro-Tip before I sign off:\n\nNever reload the Broken Butterfly, the Merchant has your back!!!","October 14, 2014","true","184.8"," 36 of 42 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","36","42","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/254700/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Trying to review Resident Evil 4 in a modern video game environment is almost unfair in a way, as though it was hugely influence when it released, after so many years the mechanics and tone is pioneered have been replicated and refined so many times over that in comparison it’s hard for RE4 to really stack up. It’s not a bad game by any means, but playing it for the first time so long after release many elements come off as unpolished, clunky, unnecessary and occasionally incredibly frustrating. All the same if you manage to get past the many fumbles it makes, the experience at its core is still something rather incredible, with an amazing sense of place and some of the most satisfying combat you’re likely to find to this day.\n\nOpening with a brief history of the events leading up to RE4, we follow Leon Kennedy as he travels to a remote village in Spain on a mission to rescue the president’s kidnapped daughter. Upon arrival, he’s greeted with the welcoming screams of mutated cult worshipers and the roar of chainsaws, as the area around him quickly descends into murderous chaos that only grows stronger the closer he gets to whatever is awaking him at its core.\n\nTo say the plot in RE4 rapidly jumps around in tone would be a bit of an understatement, but instead of being to the degradation of its narrative (or often lack of one) it actually ends up working remarkably well at keeping the plot engaging and entertaining as it transitions from horror to action by the end. That’s not to say it's without its problems, as the oodles of plot holes, stereotypical characters (of which the female ones exist as little more than sex appeal and a way to squeeze in some ridiculous boob physics), and rarely explained backstory can attest, it manages a cheese ball charm that few games manage to pull off with such dramatic alterations taking place throughout the campaign and one of the reasons I think RE4 is so endearing in a lot of ways. It seems almost intentionally dumb, inviting you to laugh along with it and try not to read anything into it.\n\nRE4’s combat is easily its biggest asset, though also where the majority of its problems become such an annoyance, being at once an incredibly visceral, impactful, and brutal event where every bullet makes an impact, but also an awkward and consistently annoying undertaking do to the ♥♥♥♥ poor controls and horrendous menu system. It’s an incredible feeling to see a shot connect in RE4, to see the result of a bullet that you can’t afford to lose, as you scramble to take down hordes of resilient enemies often in cramped corridors with little in the way of cover. In the heat of the moment RE4 is brilliant, with the slow movement of enemies (which in any other game would be immensely dull, but here buy you crucial seconds to reload and relocate yourself) providing a combat experience I’ve never found in a game. It’s deliberate and intense despite its slower pace than many games, and makes each and every encounter satisfying and engaging, ramping up to some of the most impressive boss fights I’ve ever seen in a game (as well as a few of the worst).\n\nBut on the flip side there is everything that, perhaps a decade or so was easily overlooked for all that RE4 does right, but now becomes a glaring blight on the game that seeps into every area of the experience and makes it a lesser game than it could have been. Having to open the menu to switch weapons in the heat of battle is extremely jarring and annoying, pulling me out of the experience each and every time as I fumbled to select the weapon I wanted before closing the menu and trying to find my bearings again.\n\nDoubling up on this are is the constant wart on the Resident Evil series’s face: tank controls with button mappings that all but require you to entirely relearn how to play a third person shooter, and become a recurring issue that only worsens the longer you play as enemies become stronger. I eventually became acclimated to them, but there shouldn’t be a need for that. Having to spend hours trying to wrap my head around an unintuitive control scheme and make do with what limited mobility I’m given isn’t fun, and should never be a requirement for someone to play a game well.\n\nThe unlockable side missions that star your sexy, mysterious, but otherwise entirely nondescript blank slate of a companion, Ada, are the biggest testament to this. Taking double the damage of Leon, combat becomes an intensely frustrating affair where running away was often a more viable option than trying to fight enemies that you barely have time to turn around and shoot before they kill you in two hits. It’s also comprised almost entirely of abysmal mission objectives strewn throughout areas you’ve already played through, and ending with what could easily be two of the worst bosses I’ve ever encountered in a video game. Perhaps it’s unfair to pin these failings on the entire game, but in terms of content outside of the core campaign, the Ada missions are a huge missed opportunity and a horrible experience that no one should put themselves through. They add nothing, and you would be better forgetting they are even there.\n\nBut if I can look beyond my mountain of criticism at so many areas of the game, there is still so much that RE4 does that makes it a game worth playing, though far from the masterpiece it might have been so many years ago. The atmosphere, brilliant sense of place, and fantastic combat still create an experience that’s hard to pull yourself out of despite all its flaws, and often makes it easy to look past many of them because just those parts are so amazingly done. RE4 isn’t the best game I’ve ever played, and there are things about it that if I ever have to see in a game again it will be too soon, but I don’t regret my time with it and if you’ve also neglected it up until now there’s still definitely something great here to witness, though for how much longer I couldn’t say.\n\nOn the PC port:\nAfter the trainwreck that was the first RE4 PC version, it’s a welcome relief that Capcom has come out with something that’s not only playable, but possibly the best version of the game...in most regards. Despite improved KB/M controls, textures, and a higher frame rate, they failed both at optimizing the game for a large variety of hardware, and created new issues by tying the game speed to the frame rate. I experienced consistent slowdown on a machine that ought to be more than capable of running it, and as a result often had audio desync from cutscenes, occasional freeze ups, and a general lesser visual experience having to turn down most of the limited options just to get a stable frame rate (which even then seemed to fluctuate wildly for no apparent reasons). It’s a disappointment, but in many ways this is still a great version of the game provided you far exceed the recommended requirements, and happen to be lucky as the performance issues seem largely random with who they affect.","October 7, 2014","true","21.1"," 48 of 62 people (77%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","77","48","62","6","6"

To say that Resident Evil 4 is the greatest thing to happen to survival-horror games in 2005 and... since it's creation is a bold statement and one that can be backed up by the quality of the game at hand. Resident Evil 4 is the end all, be all that the genre has strived for since its inception and is a fond love letter not just to fans of action or survival-horror but to people that simply like to play games.\n\nFrenetic action and giant boss battles aside, where Resident Evil 4 succeeds, as a survival-horror game isn't so much that it's a frightening game, though there are moments where you will be scared, but its haunting atmosphere. Resident Evil 4 will send chills through your spine as its atmosphere takes center stage against seemingly impossible odds as you go off in search of the President's daughter. The game has the right feel to it, it does have it's action go to the forefront as it's greatest strength but it never lets the action get in the way of the atmosphere and the mood. The two combine together to make Resident Evil 4 one of the most masterful games ever made and an example of how to do the genre justice without abandoning what makes it a survival-horror game.\n\nYou will be lost in Resident Evil 4's game world for at least twenty hours and you will be compelled to play through it again, either on harder difficulties or with all of your previous items in tow for the second go around. The game is truly fantastic and is well worth a purchase today for those who have never played it if only to see how it's influenced games like Dead Space and Gears of War in different ways.\n\nOverall: Whether you're a fan of Resident Evil, the survival-horror genre, action games, adventure games or simply good games, Resident Evil 4 has all the bases covered. This is the kind of game that comes along once in a console-generation and it needs to be experienced. It's a bold statement to call a game one of the all time greatest ever made but I can make that claim with Resident Evil 4 and have no reservations about it.","February 27, 2014","true","15.0"," 50 of 68 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","50","68","0","0"

However, there are a few issues with the game at the moment, that make it totally unplayable for me.  My PC specs are more than enough to play the game, and I checked that my video card was the primary GPU that the game was using. I was so Sad to get in game and experience alot of these problems that will hopefully get patched at a later date.\n\n_____________________________\nProblems with the Game at the moment:\n_____________________________\n-Game feels un-optimized for PC\n-Will Run Slow/Normally at random points\n-Character Animations will slowdown\n-Running will cause you to move slowly.  (you play a running animation but it's slowed down)\n-Certain Areas of the game will speed up/run normally/run slow depending on where you are standing/where camera is facing.\n-Quicktime events will slowdown. (jumping out of windows, cutscene events, etc)\n-Texture load error with certain enemies (will appear as these black blobs with "texture printed on them")\n-Widescreen support feels like it puts your character and aiming out of alignment\n-Mouse support is not all that great, laser reticule will sometimes flicker on and off an enemy.\n\n____________\nPros:\n____________\nAshley's Panties in 1080p HD.\n\nJoking Aside, I don't recommend buying the PC port of the game if you use an ATI or AMD graphics processor at the moment, as there are too many compatability issues.\n_________________________________________________________\nEdits: 03/17/2014\n_________________________________________________________\n-Patch was released that fixes a few things and adds some extra options to tweak your game/settings.\n\n-Aiming controls can now be switched from classic mode to "Modern mode" that tracks your mouse much better than before.

Even though it is starting to show it's age when compared to newer titles, Resident Evil 4 is still a good playthrough. I recommend if you enjoy the Resident Evil series, or horror/shooters in general to give Resident Evil 4 a playthrough.

(got it on PS2 first, played on Xbox, played the hell out of the Wii version, and now the best version: PC HD release!)\n\nStory: After the events of RE3: Nemesis, Leon Scott Kennedy is now an agent for the U.S. Government is sent on a mission to rescue the president's daughter Ashley Graham from an unknown organization that's located in Europe. When Leon arrives in a rural area of Europe to discover some bizarre villagers that are attacking him. It then leads to give you some creepy events that you will have find out how the villagers came to be and rescue Ashley.\n\nGameplay: You may know this game is responsible for revolutionizing the 3rd-person shooter genre and making it a standard today and it still lives up to it. Though without a doubt the gameplay does feel dated since you can't move the camera as you would expect from a modern 3rd-person shooter as well as move while aiming, reloading, and shooting. Aiming might feel clunky since you are always swaying your gun around even when standing still and moving around might be strange but you will get use to after a while. Weapons can be upgraded and bought from a merchant with the games currency to give you a better arsenal or even change your gameplay style of what weapons you want to use for your playthrough. The inventory is probably my most favorite inventory mechanic in a video game I have ever used. It's basically a suit case-which can be upgraded-which is were you store all of your items into including ammo, healing items, and attachments for weapons. It's an entire grid array so you can fit many items into but also make you decide if you should take certain items with you or not since you won't have enough space. Also the game has a NG+ to keep all your items and weapons upgrades to give you replay value.\n\nSurvival Horror: This game can give you the creeps at the start making you say "what the h*ll is going here", and leaves it to you to figure out what's happened. Most can be told through documents you find throughout the game and gives interesting plot points. The toughnest of the enemies as well as being out numbered by them and managing your ammo and healing items can make it a tense survival game. Boss fights can be challenging if you don't manage your inventory well enough and they have amazing designs that makes them seem very powerful. Seeing some of the creepy enemy designs latter on in the game will make your skin crawl. Though it can be argued that the game does get way more actioned focused close to the end but for the most part until 3/4 through the game it remains to be a survival horror game and one of the best ever as well.\n\nSound/Music: Gun sounds still sound good to this day and some creature's sound design can sound scary at times. The game's soundtrack does some relaxing music and even some that is really fitting for certain moments in the game whether it would be for a creepy sewer setting or a big enemy base.\n\nGraphics: Now you have to understand that this game was originally released back in 2005 for the Gamecube so you have to expect to look outdated which of course they are. Though it does have a few graphics options that does make it look better than any other version but it still does look outdated. Though you do play at higher resolution than the other platforms and this game performs very well and pretty much stays at 60fps consitently. In case if you are interested there is an HD rework project for this game that you can try out for yourself to help give the game better textures.\n\nPC port: If you remember the original PC version of RE4 was REALLY BAD. It had no mouse aiming and terrible graphics compared to other versions and was pretty much unplayable. Now with this re-release it's the PC version that we deserved! Decent graphics options, good M&K controls, full gamepad support, and beautiful consitent 60fps performance. You honestly can run this game maxed at get 60fps on a good budget PC and it will run great. No crashes throughout the entire time I played this game as well.\n\nConclusion: So you could probably tell that this is definitly one of my favorite games EVER! It helped set the standard for 3rd-person shooters and survival horror as we know it today. Sure the graphics are outdated and look very flat and muddy but it doesn't pass up for how amazing the gameplay is. The survival horror is still intense compared to other games these days and nothing has come close to match what this masterpiece of a game has made. This will forever remain as Shinji Mikami's masterpiece work of art and it has made him one of the most important video game creators of all time and he is very deserved.\n\nRating 10/10\n\n12/10 I would get this game from Easter again! ;)","May 4","true","28.6"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","23","28","2","1"

Aiming is atrocious thanks to the game converting mouse inputs into analogue x/y (controller inputs), leading to a ridiculous amount of negative mouse acceleration leaving me to fight with the controls. The Menus and general user interface remains almost untouched from its roots  yet  this is on a PC now, using wasd to manage my inventory is very tedious when I have a perfectly good mouse (added convenience from a mouse interface would be a grand selling point). However the greatest failure is the slowdown, the moment I walk into the opening village the game begins to dramatically chug as though Leon is walking on the surface of the moon, I look away from enemies and instantly the game pics up. This is unacceptable for a full released game costing £15 and renders the experience sickening (The option for 120 fps would be appreciated considering vice city had it back in 2003).\n\nIt’s still Resident Evil 4 and that fact is what truly makes this so heart breaking, I would love to be able to just play this game in all of its chainsaw fleeing monster freezing glory but seeing it in this state is truly pathetic.

It's quite a lengthy experience (in a positive way), excellent pacing, treasure hunting, resource managing, minigames, and a load of extra content that triples the replayability of this game by adding various unlockables from costumes to new guns! All of this packed in a $19.99 pricetag makes it all worthwhile; especially if you pre-purchased the game because it comes with even more extras like the full digital OST.\n\nControls are a bit more difficult if you don't take advantage of the game's controller support, but it's a great way to improve your dexterity with the keyboard / mouse and I'm already rocking my foes without a controller at this point!\n\nHowever...\n...This so called 'HD' port has its share of problems.\n\nFor starters, there is no real significant graphical improvement to the game. The textures and environments look about the same as their Gamecube / PS2 counterparts, blurry and pixelated. What the hell Capcom, why are you bragging so much about SD / HD comparisons here when there really is no significant difference?\n\nPlus the game has the tendancy of slowing down like in the matrix if you play with a fixed 60 FPS setting for most people like me (playing at a fixed 30 FPS resolves the issue, but completely undermines the '60 FPS' this port brags about), which is a real problem especially when you're watching cutscenes; it desyncs the action from the voices & sound pretty badly.\n\nCapcom claims this is due to 'Hardware' inferiority, but if I can play games like RAGE or ARMA at relatively high settings with 60+ FPS, and this 'HD' port of Resident Evil / Biohazard 4 slows down when there's even a tiny splash of pixelated water from a puddle just goes to show that Capcom needs to get into gear to better optimize the game, and stop making excuses! This game is nearly 10 years old, how demanding can a game like this be?\n\nDespite these problems I've pointed out, I still recommend the game because Capcom's going to have to address the issues sooner or later considering the fact that a majority of people like me experience these issues.

With a story that both terrifies me and makes me want to keep playing, linear gameplay that still encourages me to explore and has almost seemless chapter transition, an arsenal of weapons that makes me feel badass at one point and barely strong enough at others, and a lead protagonist who screams complete awesomeness, Resident Evil 4 is, for me, the highlight of the franchise as well as the highlight of my entire gaming career.","September 11, 2014","true","44.7"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","100","14","14","15","0"

How it's so important, it changed third-person shooters and survival horror forever, yada yada yada. But is it really still worth playing today?\n\nHell yes.\n\nAfter a disappointing experience with RE5, I had just assumed Resident Evil wasn't for me. I could not have been more wrong. This game is amazing. The combat still holds up. Although it might look boring since you can't move and shoot, it's actually one of the most intense games I've played. A single mistake can ruin everything, but you can always recover through a bit of luck and careful shooting. The AI isn't brilliant, but it's still really good, better than many modern games I could name.\n\nThe HD visuals look really nice. Each weapon is well balanced and serves it's own niche. There are a couple issues, of course. You need a big CPU if you want to run at 60 FPS, and not all the textures have been updated, leaving some rough patches in the scenery. And the cutscenes in Seperate Ways haven't been changed at all. The voice acting and plot are hilariously bad. But all in all, this game is incredibly fun. It's aged surprisingly well, and this edition puts an extra coat of polish on an already fantastic purchase. Even if you don't consider yourself a survival horror fan, you will probably enjoy this game.\n\nWhat are you waiting for?

It's fun, highly-unrealistic, and action-packed. Characters are also unique and pretty awesome.\n\nSound: Music for this game is pretty good. It's slow at the non-action sections and then hypes up when the enemies start coming. Voice acting is fantastic. Though, one certain voice will haunt you forever.\n\nGameplay: So good. For those not use to it, the controls will feel odd and you WILL have trouble moving around and fighting at first. However, the controls are made to be this way. It helps give it that survival horror feel and requires the player to use more skill and such. You will get used to them in 20 minutes. And, even if you don't, all keys are rebindable. It also has support for the 360 controller, but I perfer the mouse and keyboard. So many brats will stop playing this game because the controls aren't your stereotypical 3rd person shooter. I'm glad they aren't. Or this game wouldn't be nearly as fun. The game has great variety of enemies as well as weapons. The game also hits the dot on challenging without being too hard or too easy, atleast on the normal difficulty. Proffesional will give you one hell of a  fight though. This is also one of the few games that gets escort missions RIGHT.\n\nReplayability: Way more then you'd expect. New costumes, new unlockable weapons, a new difficulty level, 3 EXTRA MODES. Also, the game is just fun to play again IN GENERAL. Also features New-Game plus-ish features.\n\nLast thoughts: As a fan of the Resident Evil series, I can safely say this is my favorite. I have no problem with the Resident Evil series changing from Survival-Horror to Action-Horror and so many people ♥♥♥♥ on this and Resident evil 5 (Also a good game) for the sake of NOT being survival horror. That's rediculouse. Go play SIlent Hill or Amnesia for horror. This game is great mixture of action and certain horror elements (Those regenerators...*shudders*) and is a fantastic game. One of my favorites of all time.\n\n9.5/10","October 12, 2014","true","26.1"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","18","23","0","0"

The mouse is extremely restricted and slow meaning you can only turn with W,A,S,D and when going into the aim mode there is a delayed mouse response meaning pulling off those quick knee shots is far more difficult. I just don't understand how it could be screwed up this bad when re5 had a great pc port. I recommend waiting for a patch, but if you must play it get a 360 controller.

To be honest, this is the first Resident Evil game I've played in the series, so my review is based on this game alone without knowledge about the others. In this game, you're an American agent known as Leon Kennedy who is sent to a rural village in Europe to rescue the President's daughter known as Ashley Graham from this sinister organization known as the Los Illuminados. Of course, it's not just a simple rescue mission, as it is soon found out it goes much more deeper than that. Without going into spoilers, the game revolves around trying to rescue Ashley and escaping safely, but at the same time, being drawn into and having to stop an organization with their plans that threatens the entire world.\n\nI've never played the original version of this game, so I can't speak on differences, how this is better or worse, etc. That said, I found this game to be pretty good and solid. Playing this game, I got the feel from it that it was made several years ago, in terms of graphics and gameplay. Despite that, I found the game to play good. The story and characters were the highlights of the game for me. With characters, I can praise the good design, believable dialogue/personality, and more. With graphics, I can admit that they weren't state of the art like some games released today, but then considering this is an HD remake of a game released several years ago, it's understandable. And even with that, I still thought the graphics to be good with that considered, as I was able to be taken into the game and it's world, story, characters, and more. So basically, while I found the graphics to be showing their age, I did still find them to be impressive. And honestly, I wasn't a huge fan of the controls at first with character movement and camera, but as I played more of the game, I got more used to it and it became more comfortable with me. I also found the game to have an excellent variety of weapons, which you could also upgrade and have some customization with them.\n\nOverall, I give this game my two thumbs up and a recommendation from me to anyone. A great game that I enjoyed until the very end and wouldn't mind playing again sometime down the road.","March 14, 2015","true","26.9"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

In conclusion, while the games graphics compared to the original PS2 & PC versions have been amazingly been improved and very well done the game itself is just not worth buying unless they plan on making some drastic fixes to make it playable and balanced like its original counterparts. However, if your a fan of the series and especially of Resident Evil 4 and its magnicent impression on the series its worth putting the extra dollar into to add to your collection and if not I do not reccomend buying it and sticking to the original formats on your fave consoles for the best Resident Evil 4 experience especially if your new to the game itself.

After the half step toward full 3D in Code Veronica, Capcom struggled to reinvent Resident Evil for a new console generation. An early effort was re-purposed and became the brilliant Devil May Cry but it would take many years for a new vision to take shape. When Resident Evil 4 finally hit store shelves for the Gamecube in 2005, it would forever change the face of survival horror video games.\n\nPlayers once again filled the shoes of Leon Kennedy as he searches for the President's daughter, Ashley Graham, in a remote area of Spain. She is being held by a mysterious cult who are trying to utilize a mind controlling parasite called Las Plagas to gain power. The village that Leon first comes across is filled with infected townsfolk called Ganados who are hellbent on stopping Leon and completely loyal to Osmund Saddler, the leader of the Illuminados cult. Lurking behind the scenes is the familiar face of Ada Wong whose activities are a mystery. Resident Evil 4 continues the tradition of offering an eccentric and ridiculous narrative that successfully links some of the franchise's biggest characters to it's events but also stands well enough on it's own that newcomers are not left scratching their heads.\n\nThe tank controls of past Resident Evil games are gone, the camera instead looks over Leon's shoulder in a fully 3D rendered environment. The camera's position obscures some of the action and creates some tense moments while allowing players to enjoy more fluid and natural controls. When aiming his gun or wielding a knife, Leon remains in a fixed position which may seem unnatural to action game aficionados but it does create some tense moments as groups of enemies converge on Leon's position. With this new control scheme gunplay is a much bigger focus than in past Resident Evil titles. Enemies come in greater volumes, ammo for basic weapons is more plentiful and there are a few set piece moments that require you to gun down scores of ganados lest they tear Leon's limbs from his body. When it comes to gameplay and combat, the Plagas present a satisfying new angle to the gameplay in Resident Evil. The Ganados function the same as the Zombies in prior titles but with added tenacity and dexterity. They throw axes and dynamite, climb ladders and leap across small chasms in pursuit of Leon. Additionally, relieving a hapless Ganado of his or her head may not be the end of a fight since the pesky Plagas are prone to evacuate their hosts and tackle Leon directly or cowardly emerge from the bloody stumps of their necks, flailing their tentacle like bodies like guillotine blades attached to a weed eater. Shield bearing cult members and blind mutants with massive claws that must be dispatched by killing the parasites on their backs also refresh the enemy roster and make the combat in Resident Evil 4 more satisfying. Several satisfying boss fights provide the cherry on top of the Resident Evil 4 gameplay experience.\n\nThe greater focus on action does mean that scares are less frequent then they were in previous entries. Wandering around a hedge maze with Plagas infested wolves waiting to jump out of bushes and seeking keys whilst being pursued by wheezing, seemingly unstoppable regenerators are some of Resident Evil 4's few terrifying highlights during it's three acts. While the first two acts are enjoyable and varied the end of the third act is a monotonous shooting gallery that culminates in one of the easiest final boss battles in the series. For a game with so many strong characters and boss scenarios the conclusion is a bit anti-climatic. This handful of minor grimace worthy moments is largely lost in amidst the rest of the experience which will take most players fifteen or more hours on their first playthrough.\n\nAs if the main campaign wasn't long enough, Assignment Ada reveals some of Ada's activities behind key moments in Resident Evil 4, fleshing out the narrative and offering some new weapons and mechanics to challenge Resident Evil fans. Mercenaries mode challenges players to survive and kill as many enemies as possible. It's an addictive mode that would go on to become a staple of the franchise by enticing players with a risk reward system, stringing together kills gives players a multiplier and breaking hourglasses extends the time of the session, providing a greater opportunity to post a high score. With these additional modes, it's really easy to get thirty hours of entertainment from Resident Evil 4.\n\nThe muted, earth tone rich Spanish village that serves as Resident Evil 4's setting is a massive departure from the dark, claustrophobic and sinister mansion from the first game and the post apocalptic city scape of the second and third games. When it was first released, Resident Evil 4 was one of the most impressive graphical showcases of the Playstation 2 and Gamecube. With a 1080p resolution and some uprezed textures, Resident Evil 4 looks it's age but it is still capable of impressing. The atmosphere is as rich in 2016 as it was in 2005 but we do wish Capcom gave this game the respect to completely overhaul it in the same way that they did the fist Resident Evil game for the Gamecube. Rest assured however, this new HD port of Resident Evil 4 finally gives PC players an acceptable version of this classic to play.\n\nResident Evil 4 is a bittersweet experience, along with Half life 2, it helped foreshadow what was to come with new hardware as well as perfectly reinvigorating and updating a franchise that was in danger of loosing it's appeal as new hardware changed gamers expectations. In doing so however, Resident Evil 4 shifted the franchise's inertia toward action and with the next couple installments, Resident Evil would almost entirely forsake it's horror roots. With the death of Resident Evil as a horror game, much of the survival horror genre fell into mediocrity with Dead Space being one of the few titles to successfully straddle the line between action and horror before becoming a victim of the same fate. Resident Evil 4 is one of the greatest games of the new millennium. It maintained enough of the elements of it's predecessors to be identifiable as a Resident Evil game while otherwise reinventing the franchise. It's timeless gameplay, great art direction and mostly excellent bosses make it very playable almost a decade after it's original release. If you haven't played Resident Evil 4, now is as good a time as any.","April 8","true","7.0"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

First off my computer can handle a lot, so the issue is with the game, not the hardware. When I first started the game, it chugged slower than a snail in molasses. I thought that this was perhaps a first time startup thing. I got to the main menu where the curser itself lagged out and it could barely move. I first went to the options and for good measure I set all the graphics to the lowest settings and all the prettiness to "off" to try and improve performance. It barely changed anything, even after restarting the game it churned slowly. I thought maybe just maybe the real game wouldnt be so bad... but to my suprise it was worse. The cutscene was super slow, and when i skipped the cutscene (out of neccessity in order to move past the seemingly frozen frames) I got to the first screen of the game with half the textures missing. It was all black! and Leon moved of his own accord in a small circle shooting at the ground. I checked that my controller was not plugged in and on the floor or something, and that nothing was on my computer keyboard. It seemed as if everything was going wrong. But please, dont take my word for it, just look here at this screenshot and decide for yourselves weather or not to support another badly hashed port of a great game. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=233253590","February 28, 2014","false","6.1"," 45 of 76 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","45","76","0","0"

The game is nearly 10 years old and it's still as moody and creepy as when it was first released. However, if you've played the Gamecube version you'll notice this PC version lacks a bit of dynamic lighting that was present in the original game. It makes the game a tiny bit less creepy, but just a tiny bit. The PC version makes up for it with 60fps gameplay and mouse support. The mouse support is pretty awful however, so I connected my controller within minutes. Playing with a controller still takes a bit of getting used to, but it's so much better than playing with a mouse and keyboard. Except for the aiming, of course.\n\nYou aim with the red laser on your pistol and because your character and gun sway it can be difficult to make precise shots. Ammo is limited, so you have to be careful with it and make sure that every shot counts. Even if that is pretty much impossible. Treasures can also be found on the islands and they can be sold to a salesman that sells upgrades and weapons. He does not sell ammo, though. And that's a good thing, because it would've made it an action game instead of a survival horror game. I thought it was all perfectly balanced; I almost always had enough ammo to kill enemies and never too much (ok, there might have been a bit more ammo near the final boss).\n\nRE4 is also responsible for the revolutionary over-the-shoulder camera view, which puts you right behind the character and with it adds that special layer of tension and immersion to the game. Brilliant stuff.\n\nAlso, I'm glad I finally managed to finish the game, because I never was able to finish it on the Gamecube.\n\nYour quest is long and will take you a minimum of 16 hours to complete. After that you can play the extra missions that were present in the PS2 version. The game never got boring (unlike RE6) or too scary. Like I said before, it is perfectly balanced.\n\nThe graphics still hold up, even if a lot of textures are blurry. There's still an amazing amount of detail to be found in the environments and characters, and let me remind you that this is an old game. I'm not talking about the upgraded textures here. I'm impressed the Gamecube was even capable of displaying this back then. The fact that the PC version now has the ability to show the game at 60fps makes it even better. Controls feel more responsive (QTEs are the exception here) and the gameplay is an even smoother experience. The sounds are still awesome and add to the creepy atmosphere of the game. Even the voice acting still holds up, but note that there are still a few corny lines here and there. Nothing that detracts from the experience if you ask me.\n\nRE4 is an excellent game that still holds up to this day, and if you never had the chance to play it before, now is the time. There's no excuse to not play it so off you go.\n\n[Rating: 92/100]","March 9, 2014","true","18.4"," 18 of 26 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","18","26","0","1"

I LOVED Resident Evil 4 and it's my favorite in the series, and I was more excited than anyone I knew for the PC release, but it was nothing but a disappointment, to be honest. For a port of a 10 year old game, it's RIDICULOUSLY demanding. I can run games that look a lot better at 60fps, maxed out settings and never encounter any slowdowns, graphical glitches or anything. People will say "durrr get a new toaster!" or "your pc just suck!". Well, my PC is only $1000 and daddy and mummy wouldn't give me money for a more expensive gaming PC like yours. This port is POORLYoptimized and for a lot of people it's riddled with slowdowns, off-sync audio, flickering textures, flickering lighting, green flickering between cutscenes, blurry text, and many other problems.\n\nAs it stands, the game has no subtitles, even though they appear greyed out and off in the options. The game has a misleading "Return to Main Menu". Most people can get rid of the slowdowns if you lock it to 30fps, but that defeats the purpose of getting the HD edition for PC eh? You'd have a better time getting it on your console. But with all the graphical glitches this makes this version unplayable for me. I'd be able to crack out my Wii version and have a better time with it, and it would look a heck of a lot better.

They’re all revolutionary video games that have altered the way we play and perceive games and gameplay. Resident Evil 4 certainly belongs in that list for many, many reasons.\n\nIt takes much from a company to invent the wheel twice. The Resident Evil series is known for having codified and popularised the survival horror genre in games. This game though, Resident Evil 4 laid the foundation for modern survival horror games, third person shooters, and other action games that we see and play today. Before Resident Evil 4, third person shooters were a mixed bag. The camera was a mess, or it gave you a terrible view of the action. Resident Evil 4 fixed all that with a streamlined over-the-shoulder-cam, aiming mechanics and challenging gunplay. Stiff controls were remedied with the ability to dodge on reflex button presses, now known as the much maligned quick time events. Finally, whatever we classify as cinematic gameplay these days was perfectly proportioned and executed in Capcom’s 2004 behemoth masterpiece.\n\nMany of the aforementioned innovations are mainstay today, but back then they were earth shattering. It is a testament to wholesome game design. Not only are the mechanics polished to a shine, they complement and substitute each other. QTE-s don’t overstay their welcome and they have weight and purpose to them. The camera keeps you, the player, in the game and as a result inside the character; forcing you be careful and actually giving you a reason to prevent grave bodily harm.\n\nAnd bodily harm is ever so present. You’re Leon Kennedy, one of the few survivors from the Raccoon City outbreak and now in the employment of the secret service. Tasked to retrieve the president’s daughter from a desolate rural region in Spain. What you uncover goes beyond the horrors of zombies and corporate scheming.\n\nResident Evil 4 uproots the series established formula and takes survival horror to survival terror. The sheer viscerality of the presentation makes for a non-stop freight. Horrifying villagers drone at you in the dark while their heads make place for disgusting parasitic flails that take precarious aim to keep at bay. The horrifying rumble of a chainsaw soon makes place for the utterly blood curdling terror that are the late game enemies that approach the limits of how much a person’s senses can process while trying to get the girl home safely. The music is frighteningly effective at enforcing the sense of unease. The mild bliss of the piano that plays in save rooms is the only respite. Especially considering the sound design on some of the enemies. Just the breathing of some of these freaks just makes you want to turn your PC off and sit in a corner; crying in abject terror, afraid of the nightmare that you will have when you go to bed later that day.\n\nWhat’s more? What else can a game so amazing offer more? Imagine a season’s pass worth of extra material. Except that you don’t have to pay extra for it. Two extra chapters, a cruelly addictive minigame, new game+ and a whole plethora of costumes and weapons are all included in the single price. It is hard to get such a deal these days, and it shows how far publishers have fallen in terms of packing their releases with content. Ironically, Capcom is one of today’s greatest offenders.\n\nStill, the game has aged. The controls are stiff, the textures are muddy at times and the occasional slow-motion might present itself when the lighting engine has to bend in ways it wasn’t designed to. However, do not forget, that Resident Evil 4 is a full package. Everything is balanced in and on itself, creating a wholesome and undeniably enjoyable game that can keep you entertained even ten years after it first saw the light of day on the Gamecube. Resident Evil 4 must be played. Passing up on it is an insult to videogame history and an insult to yourself. You’d be a fool for passing up on a near divine piece of gameplay that is equally hellish in atmosphere.","May 21, 2015","true","15.1"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

This was the first game to feature the new Resident Evil layout of commands and at the time it was demonized for not being the classic survival horror as the old games were.\n\nI loved them, I really did, but it was time for a change of that clunky movement system(if you played the originals you remember it took a hour just to turn around with your feet planted onto the ground, I still miss the fixed camera though).\n\nThat being said the game is/has:\n\n- REALLY good\n- decently long\n- nice and well balanced\n- different environments\n- cool bosses and events\n- a HUGE replay value\n- more modes to play it even more!\n- tons of other stuff\n- tons of mods if you STILL feel like playing it\n\nThere's also a couple of bad things like:\n\n- the graphic is starting to show its age even though I'm accostumed to it\n- the porting. It's good but for some reason on quite a lot of GPU's it starts to slow down REALLY HARD when there's a couple more enemies on scene than there should be\n\nConsider that I'm running this on a GTX 750 2GB but I've had friends experience the issue on more powerful GPU's. You can either lock the game at 30fps or 60fps(nothing in between or above that) so setting it to 30 "fixes" it.\n\nI also still reccomend playing it in 30fps because that's how the games was supposed to be played when it came out and the 60fps glitch some stuff(doors and more) and even though we all love the 60fps this is not a complete overhaul of the game but just a re-texture so playing it "as it was" is the best option imho.\n\nThat being said if you're still thinking about getting RE4 well, I love the serie but it's still a classic for those who don't too! Wait for the sale if you're not 100% sold on this but trust me, this will give you a great time and will prepare you for RE5 which you can co-op with a friend too :)\n\nP.s. oh and to be clear don't mind my played hours here. I played it on the GameCube during the original release and finished it more than 10 times, then I played it and beat it at a friend's house a couple times, then I finished it on an "non original" version waiting for the sale on Steam and only THEN I got it and finished it once here.\n\nNow I have a couple more games that are keeping me busy but I plan to finish it over and over again here, it's just THAT good ;)","April 22","true","20.1"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

The game basically puts you in the shoes of government agent Leon S. Kennedy who is sent out on a mission to retrieve the president's missing daughter, but stumbles on something more dangerous than what he originally thought. For $19.99, you get a lot out of this game. You get an amazing story that is well worth your time, additional modes to play with after you beat the game, a great combat system with unpredictable enemies, and some fairly challenging boss battles that should keep you busy for a while. In general, Resident Evil 4 / Biohazard 4 is one of the best video games I have ever played in my life, and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes horror.\n\nThe Verdict: 10/10 Definetly one of my favorite games of all time.

Terrible PC port with god-awful controls. Leon handles about as gracefully as an overloaded rubbish truck with the tyres let out, the mouse speed is so slow that the whole thing plays like one of those underwater dreams (even at maximum sensitivity), sometimes it dislikes it when you try to turn, and casues Leon to end up facing 90-180 degrees away from where you intended (especially in the midst of combat), and half the quick time events are broken. Also, you can't sidestep. Presumably, forcing you to run around a corner and right into that zombie/dynamite trap makes it that much scarier, but I would have to say it's just poor design.\n\nOh, and fairly mediocre plot and character development.

Coming back from an eight year Resident Evil hiatus and playing this game again was a refreshing treat. I will also say that I enjoyed it on the PC much more than PS2 or even Game Cube. I really liked the direction Resident Evil 4 shifted towards… and not just because I liked Ashley Graham’s jugs. I’ll admit that it was a big adjustment getting used to RE4 at first. When the game was first released back in 2005, I was whining and crapping out bricks when I got my pre-order copy on Game Cube and played it for the first time. I was upset because it didn’t have any zombies, and I didn’t think that the old men with rakes and pitchforks at the beginning were very menacing foes. But playing further into the game and encountering some of the tougher enemies and intimidating bosses along with the really captivating level designs… this game turned out to be a real gem and became my favorite of the RE series. I even liked it more than Code Veronica X where I was obsessed with Claire Redfield’s jugs… and then before that where I fantasized over Jill Valentine’s awesome jugs… a rack worthy of resting my joystick on / or I should say in between. Sorry, I got lost in the moment thinking about all those gorgeous jugs and giving Jill Valentine a pearl necklace with extra Big Mac sauce… anyway back to my review. I have not Played RE 5 or RE 6, but if they are half as good as RE 4; then they will be well worth playing. I’m really down for playing RE 6; that Helena Harper is one fine piece of ♥♥♥ and she has got a phenomenal pair of jugs – and Juggerdan likes his jugs. Seriously though… Resident Evil 4 has got my seal of approval at 10/10. Get this game if you haven’t played it, or missed it to play the newer ones… It’s a classic. Oh and just in case I forgot to mention, that Ashley Graham has got a fine pair of jugs! :)\n","April 27, 2014","true","30.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","1"

First of all Resident Evil 4 is personally ranked as my #2 favorite game of all time. It is also my favorite Last Gen game. I have beaten the game more than 10 times due to its high replayibility and unlocks. I have played the game on gamecube when it first came out around 2004ish, then on my Wii, xbox 360 HD edition, and finally the Ultimate HD PC Edition. I am here to say without a doubt that the PC port is the best version of them all for many reasons. The HD remake is absolutely gorgeous and feels very smooth with its 60FPS option. For a game that has been out for a decade now it still makes some current gen games look older. Not only are the graphics good, but the gameplay is what makes this game such a gem. Its original third person over the shoulder combat style aiming revolutionized the third person gaming world today. This is the kind of game that gets better the more you progress, making replaying on higher difficulties worth it for its rewards. You play as Leon S. Kennedy who is a familiar Resident Evil Character first seen in Resident Evil 2. A ton of other characters make small cameos that I do not want to spoil. You are tasked with finding and rescuing the President's daughter, Ashley Graham, from a group of cult like crazies called Los Illuminados. Without giving away too much, the game follows that story pretty well.\n\nAside from Story Mode, the player can then play a mode called the Mercenaries and other game modes that open up a new character's storyline. All in all there is TONS of stuff to do in Resident Evil 4 and with only 25ish hours in I still have stuff to do in this game. Like I said earlier, I have played this game numerous times and still to this day I enjoy every bit of it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/remote_viewer/recommended/254700/","remote_viewer","zone","http://steamcommunity.com/id/remote_viewer/","572 products in account","This game holds up perfectly after all these years.  Still one of the most tense and atmospheric video games I've played — and, I would like to point out, largely because of the controls.  Many will whine, "artificial difficulty!" but to me they're just as they were in 2005: deliberately clunky yet stylized, oddly stiff and elegant at the same time.  It feels like there's an art to managing headshots and kicks on a crowd of swarming not-zombies, and when you have to move there's a sense of urgency and spatial consideration.  In total, it feels like something halfway between Doom and King's Field, and is quite likely the best Biohazard/RE to date.  The port here is just fine, too, though I've encountered a few fleeting issues with slowdown and stuttering.  Nothing that has kept me from thoroughly enjoying this old favorite.  Oh: the music is really something, as well.  (01/22/15 edit: There are some issues with QTEs tied to the framerate, sometimes leading to issues where QTEs are either too easy or too punishing.  QTEs were the worst part of the game to begin with, aside from a slight decline in the quality of the environments around 2/3 into the game, but they're even worse/weirder here and it does mar an otherwise solid port — albeit one I would still recommend.

My playtime at the time of the writing of this review indicates that I haven't played this game all that much, but I should point out that I have beaten the game twice before in a different version of the game. Highly recommended, I say.\n\nNo, this is more of a review of the port rather than the game, and perhaps you may want to consider looking at a version of the game that isn't this one.\n\nCapcom clearly didn't put forth a ton of effort into the PC port of the HD version of Resident Evil 4, originally released last year for the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3. One could be forgiven for thinking that the delay was likely for the purposes of optimization    and the inclusion of standard PC options, but Capcom will occasionally pull an Ubisoft and delay PC ports for aribtrary reasons, just for them to end up performing suboptimally (see also: the kerfuffle going on about the upcoming Dead Rising 3 port).\n\nThey did at least put in a handful of the standard PC options, so it's not entirely bad news. The list of options includes fairly standard anti-aliasing settings, anisotropic filtering, and turning off the godawful motion blur. Allegedly you can turn off v-sync in a config file that I have yet to locate on my computer (for some reason it doesn't exist in the location that I've heard it's supposed to be, so either that's just a problem on my end, or I'm working with outdated information), and sweet, sweet 60 FPS (unfortunately capped at that or 30, but acceptable for a port of a 9-year-old game). What they get wrong, however, are a couple of key factors that keep me from recommending this version of the game. The aformentioned 60 FPS option is quite the boon, but it does run into some issues that are largely attributed to dodgy optimization. The game speed tends to slow down as the framerate chugs, which can be very distracting. I wasn't experiencing too much of this after turning down a few settings, but your mileage may vary, as is the nature of PC gaming.\n\nThat first issue I could probably deal with, but it gets worse. Usually I don't tend to expect a field-of-view slider in a third-person game, but dear God this game in particular needs one. The over-the-shoulder camera angle in games like this or Gears of War I feel lends itself to the problems of a low FOV in a first-person game a lot more than in games like Max Payne or Grand Theft Auto, where the camera is farther away from the player character. It's arguable that such games should possibly include one anyway for accessibility's sake, however I do understand why Capcom might not have considered it since most people likely played this game originally on a TV at a farther distance than one would be playing the game from a desk. There does technically exist an FOV mod, but as of this writing it doesn't work on the current version of the game.\n\nEven that I could get past by taking a break every half-hour or so. It's not ideal, but not a deal-breaker either. However this game commits what I consider to be a cardinal sin for a PC port of a shooter. This game has built-in mouse acceleration. Highly noticeable and affecting mouse acceleration. And there's no way to turn it off. No fix currently exists. This makes aiming in this game far more difficult than it has any reason to be. A lack of consistancy in the mouse sensitivity makes the case that the Wii version is BY FAR the most well-controlled version of the game. Comparing it to PC...that just shouldn't be the case. This issue alone I think makes it difficult to recommend this version of the game. I just don't see myself being able to put up with this nonsense throughout the entire game, and I'd imagine others would feel the same way.\n\nThere are a couple other issues the port has, such as some very noticeable audio de-sync going on in some of the cutscenes. I think I heard that this might be less of an issue depending on how well your machine runs the game, but I think it still bears mentioning, as the delay can get to be embarassingly large. One cutscene in particular had AT LEAST a full second of delay where the visuals were behind the audio. Still, issues such as this one are pretty much nitpicks compared to the awful mouse acceleration.\n\nIf this game gets a fix in the future, even if it's just through mods, I may revise this review and possibly give it a recommendation simply because the game itself is just that damn good. As it stands, I just can't recommend this right now. If you see this game on sale in the future and are tempted to buy it, I'd check pcgamingwiki.com or the Steam forums to see if the major issues have been resolved. If so, go for it. Otherwise, just pass, even if the price is attractive to you. If you're looking for another version of the game to play, I'd personally recommend the Wii version due to the controls actually working pretty well if you're willing to put up with a bit of waggle during the QTEs (to those who argue that the more precise aiming "throws off the balance" and makes the game worse, all I have to say is we'll have to agree to disagree on that debate). Otherwise, pick up any of the other console versions that exist as I'm sure they're all just fine and dandy.\n\nJust don't pick up the original PC version. Just...don't do it.","June 29, 2014","false","2.7"," 19 of 31 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","19","31","0","0"

Ever.\n\nI can't speak for how different this game is from the past instalments.  However, this game is fantastic and I find that it's succesfully managed to get me hooked on the entire franchise; I'm a picky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ when it comes to the games I like/craft the badges for nowadays, but I just had to do it for this game.  It's fun, satisfying and well worth the money I payed for it.\n\nThe story is summed up like this; Leon S. Kennedy is sent to a rural Spanish village, where it is most likely the President's kidnapped daughter will be.  As you can expect, things go wrong very quickly and Leon is forced to fight his way to the President's daughter and fight his way out.  Not completely original but still not executed poorly; whatever story was there was enjoyable to follow and I feel like it increased how much I liked the game.\n\nAnybody who is accustomed to modern third-person shooter controls will find these ones stiff at first; you can't run and shoot, you can't run and reload, you basically can't run while on the offensive.  That being said, this feature makes Leon feel more helpless, making the atmosphere and the environment of the village-gone-wrong even more effective.  Going up against a mob of people and being forced to run away so you can regain your composure and reload is something that is key to the game and I actually think it's a good idea it's there.\n\nA problem that I faced, however, was a good amount of framerate issues.  At first these really weren't that prominent; however, when you get later in the game this just seems to get far worse than before.  Since I was already hooked on the game I didn't quit after this, nor did I find it to be a gamebreaking issue, but it still really affected how immersed I was with it.  I'm not sure that this will be fixed entirely; this is a Capcom game and to be truthful they aren't exactly amazing with their fan service (GFWL not being removed from most of their games, apparently ruining this franchise with Resident Evil 6 and Raccoon City, DLC that's completed and on the disc yet still charging customers extra for it, managing to bury my favourite Mega Man spin-off franchise).  That being said however, it isn't a MAJOR MAJOR issue and you could easily look past it with how much you're getting.\n\nTo sum it up, I had and am still having a lot of fun.  Pretty much at the last parts of the game at this point and I hope that the ending will be a satisfying touch to an already great game.  I think Capcom really did justice to this instalment.","April 26, 2014","true","14.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

They've added in all the extra modes from the later incarnations like Ada's side of the story and Leon in his Smooth Criminal outfit... Ashley in her Arthur armor as well... Normal has to be completed to unlock Pro as well as all the extra stuff so prepare to be bored for the first 10 hours of the game... unless you're a pro, then cut that time by about half.\n\nSo I guess this is the like the ABSOLUTE TRUE 100% OFFICIAL RAINBOW TURBO EDITION of RE4.... so like please, Capcom, as desperate as you are, don't make me buy this game for a 5th time... or is it 6th? I don't even remember, I lost count of how many times I've had to re-purchase this game and kick it's ♥♥♥.\n\nAlso most of the glitches from the original GC version are stripped out, like skipping the hedge maze portion of the game... But don't fret, there are quite a few avid cheaters uploading scores to the leaderboards so don't even bother wasting your time with speed running, you'll never get close to the top 30 because they all cheat.\n\nI recommened this game for the nostalgia factor (I cringe typing that because this game is only 10 years old and it's considered nostalgic..... God I'm old....) If you're looking for a solid survival horror game... well look elsewhere because this game was the beginning of the end for RE as we know it... So all hail RE4, the bringer of destruction, as one of the best action horror games ever created.","September 2, 2014","true","12.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","5","5","3","0"

In fact played entired game with my fiance and damn it was a blast how much she enjoyed it.\n"Because of Ashley and climate, and enemies, las plagas and so on" those are her words not mine, and believe me she's not really a gamer or a person who like to blow ♥♥♥♥ up in videogames. And yet we beat it together for the reason above and i do totaly agree with it. Climat is great, atmosphere is really cool especially in the early stages when you are dropped into the village with absolutely no idea what to expect. Graphic... well design is amazing both protagonist and antagonist (sometimes it gets bit confusing who is which of them which is cool too). Desing of enemies along with all sounds and voices does a marvelous job for the game BUT keep in mind that this is and older game and it's just a PC port from PlayStation 2 WHICH was already a port from GameCube soo... You get the idea right ? Overall visuals appeal to gamers but they are far from amazing, and to add you even more graphic WAS of this game could be amazing about... 2 years prior to it's release. Anyway screw it, it does the job fair enough if you will remember that it's old. As I said before Sounds and voices are pure gold, all sounds just like it suppose to and that's most important. Music ? There is none. Gameplay wise - it's realy fun and enjoyable BUT not from the start. At start IT SUCKS. And you know why it sucks ? Because it's the worst kind of port loop. What i mean by that ? Everyone who played probably already know. If there is a thing that will get you mad and ♥♥♥♥♥ing about everything IT'S CONTROLS. You see the most important thing in enjoyable PLAYTHROUGH IS BEING ABLE TO PLAY THROUGH. But give it a shot. I know that game should hook you just from the start, and RE4 tries, it reall tries as hard as it can especially with atmosphere but also unfortunately slaps you straight into you dirty face and punch in the balls. Playing the first hour will get you used to it though and later only from time to time you will ♥♥♥♥♥ about it.\nAll and all i'm telling you guys - if for some reason you did not play it yet, do it. Try to play it in small doses tho since it may become a bit repetetive at times and bit boring at the end. But those are just minor complains that doesn't really affect overall game play experience. There is now also lot of bonus content, like mercenaries mode, sorta like a minor campaigns and literally TONS of content in here. Buy it, have fun and try to forgive that it's rather clumsy port of another port. It's definitely recommended and the BEST resident evil game to date in my opionion and plenty of other players and the game that you should try despite the fact of being or not Resident Evil fan.\nHave a good day guys !\nFrankCastle51 out.","February 21","true","29.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","6","7","2","0"

Personally, I found it to be quite entertaining. Out of the more modern Resident Evil games, this is the best. The story isn't all that amazing, but the gameplay is very fun. Controls are nice and tight, and visually looks great.\n\nMy only gripe is the quick events, this is the RE title that started them. At times they're completely fine, and other times they're just really frustrating. For example, in the middle of a dialogue movie you'll need to press two buttons or just die on the spot... sometimes my hand isn't even on the keyboard as I'm watching the video... and I have to take a death and do it over. Another time I was finishing a ~5 minute event and it was followed by not one, but two events that I failed consecutively to my death. Lazy design on those in my opinion.\n\nOther than that, if you're a fan of Resident Evil... check this one out.\n\nGot this for $10 during the Halloween sale, and is WELL worth it.","November 2, 2014","true","12.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Resident Evil 4 is still a tense, unsettling game. Ammunition is scarce and the 'zombies' are plentiful, sporting dungarees and looking like refugees from the 'Deliverance' movie. Maybe this is what happened to Dexy's Midnight Runners since they split up. The lack of guns and bullets make you ponder your next move, and wishing you could collect more pairs of underpants, rather than whistling as you work your way through the hordes with an AK-47. You can pick off a batch of them from a distance with a sniper rifle, only to turn a corner and find a gang of them high-tailing after you. And they aren't even zombies, they are disgruntled nutcases, another unwanted gift from the ever-shady 'Umbrella' corporation. These unpleasant chaps and erm 'ladies' shout at you in a sort of unintelligable lingo. They love their pitchforks, axes, dynamite sticks, and huge boulders which they roll down hills at you. Fortunately they are less than proficient at throwing dynamite, often blowing themselves up if you stand on higher ground. But watch out for the array of booby traps scattered about. Trip-wire and bear-traps are popular. And if you run out of bullets, you had better perfect your knife slicing technique or these raving loons might just make sandwiches out of you. Resident Evil 4 sent the survival horror genre off in a whole new direction when it was released about a thousand years ago, and it would have been nice to see the game reimagined for next-gen, but the difference between the HD version and the original does seem only cosmetic. The game deserves more than just the lick of paint it gets here, but it's still as gripping an experience as it ever was.\n\n9/10 (As scored in 1861, when I had a Gamecube)","February 27, 2014","true","2.2"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

The story is good too, as it does fit well to the resident evil formula and takes the series into a bold new direction.  6 years has passed since the devestation accord in Raccoon City.  Taking place at Europe in the rural part of Spain, U.S. Government Agent Leon Scott Kennedy is tasked to search for the President missing daughter that has been kindnapped.  Upon his arrival Leon finds out that the village isn't all what it should be as he attacked by not zombies, but by Ganados which are humans infected by the parasite know as Las Plagas.  Leon soon get's injected by the sperm of Las Plagas and only have a matter of time to complete his mission before he'll end up being one of them.\n\nResident Evil 4 retains the series novelty, but also streamlining the frustration that has plagued the series for awhile.  It does away it's complex puzzle, fixed camera angles in favor to a more action-oriented approach, it has the best camera I've seen in RE4 and it does a great job keeping up the frame of the action and showing it's dark, gloomy visuals the game is build upon back in 2005 when it was originally released.\n\nYou know what, I should say this anyway:  Resident Evil 4 Ultimate HD Edition is a solid port to a great game, it's better then the 360/PS3 version in all aspects since the settings is superb in everyway, there are a huge framerate problems in some areas, but the sence of scale and fun action is enough to enjoy this already excellent game.  Don't expect much out of this version, because this is the same PS2 version you got back in 2005 since it has all the content it needs.  Capcom needs to step up the re-release of these games and give us more of it or stop doing it entirely. (They won't stop doing it thou...)\n\nThe questionable performance is a curious one since it requires a good computer, but no matter how good your PC is, you will run into framerate issues in this "Cough" Ultimate HD Edition.  Still, I recommended for those who wants to experience this legendary horror game for the first time or your playing this because your a fan of the series.  Rest assure, Resident Evil 4 Ultimate HD Edition is a solid port and worth the value it's asking.","September 16, 2014","true","14.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/andsalx95/recommended/254700/","andsalx95","Andrey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/andsalx95/","208 products in account","As we come closer to a decade since Resident Evil 4 was first released for the Gamecube, Capcom decided to tie up some loose ends, remaking the PC version.\n\nSince this is a re-issue and not a brand new game, I think it's better for this review to focus on the improvements and flaws this "Ultimate HD version" offers, rather than talking about the game itself. 9 years after its release, I think we all know Resident Evil 4 was a great game, that marked a new direction to the series, aiming towards the Action genre instead of the Survival Horror themed games we were used to back in the day.\n\nComparing this game to the original Ubisoft version is pretty much of an insult... to the Steam version. The Ubisoft version was an awful port that is hard to believe it could come into existence (at least as the status it had when released). Thankfully, there are some good hearted people who tried to fix most of the catastrophic blunders that version had so they could turn it into an actual enjoyable game while we waited for this new version.\n\nThe Steam version comes on and I'm glad to see many of the problems being solved; starting with being able to recognize which key/button to use either with the keyboard or controller, rather than patching the game. Forget about getting crushed by boulders just because you have to guess with key/button is supposed to be "3" and "5".\n\nThe lighting and shadows look way better than the patch Ubisoft released for their dreadful version. The fact that you can actually destroy torches, affecting the lighting of the ambience, is a good highlight.\n\nThe quality of the textures are good overall, although I'm a little bit disappointed since some of the textures in the fan made "Albert Texture Patch 2.0" for the original version looked way better.\n\nThe cutscenes are probably the best improvement in this version; while in the other platforms and versions you could recognize many differences between cutscenes and gameplay, in this one there's no such differences.\n\nThe 60 FPS mode was the hardest thing to get used to. The first times I played the game I felt the sensation that it was going too fast, but I ended up used to it.\n\nThere are, however, some problems I found in this version.\n-In first place, some enemies go crazy. Some Ganados and Garradores use to spin in the same position for no apparent reason.\n-As far as I remember, there's still a poor quality cutscene in the game, specifically one of the first ones in the Separate Ways campaign. In fact, it looks worse than the Ubisoft version ones, and that's saying a lot.\nEDIT: I'm reading some reviews here on Steam from people complaining about the whole Separate Ways campaign to have mediocre cutscenes. So, that makes things even worse.\n-Sometimes, the game drops to a barely playable framerate. It happens mostly when throwing a flashbang to the first plaga that emerges from the head of a Ganado, or during the final battle against Saddler. My PC meets the requirements to play this game with no such problems, but they keep happening.\n-What's up with gravity in this game? When you shoot say, a spinel, from a cave or a wall, it falls at a ludicrously high speed.\n-The amount of achievements in this game are poor. And most of them are so easy to get. Achievements are supposed to be an extra challenge to the player. They could have put, for example, one for destroying a certain amount of torches, or by getting a specific score in The Mercenaries.\n\nOverall, this version is worth the money. It takes one of the greatest games of the last decade and puts it into the quality that PC Gamers deserved in first place.","September 30, 2014","true","69.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

There are no gamebreaking bugs (I didn't experienced any bugs at all) and the gameplay is fluent (no long loading screens, boring things et cetera).\nI recommend to play this game with a controller.","February 2","true","29.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Anyway Resident Evil 4 is basically the game the paved the way for survival horror games like Dead Space.\n\nThis game is really fun, though some people may not like the controls for keyboard and mouse. I personally played with a Xbox Controller but it comes down to personal preference I suppose.\n\nA lot of people said that this game didn't run very well, however the game ran perfectly for me at 1920x1080. No slowdowns, frame drops, etc.\nSpecs are:\nAMD Athlon x3 455 3.2GHz\n8GB of DDR2 1333 RAM\n1TB Seagate + 32gb SSD (This game is on my SSD)\nAMD Radeon 6850 1GB\n\nThese aren't even that good of specs and I can play it maxed, so I'm not really sure how everyone else cant play it to be honest.\nWhen it comes down to it I'd give this game a 9.8/10 and it is a "Must Play" for any survival horror fan. Also, this game is nothing like Resident Evil 6 if you're a newer fan playing the older games. In fact I'd say that if you liked Resident Evil 6 you probably won't like Resident Evil 4 at all.\nAlso 12/12 Achievments in 16 hours ;)","September 20, 2014","true","15.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The game also supports multiple playstyles--you can succeed as a bull-in-a-china-shop player, or as a more patient player. The game does contain some surprises and shocks, but I didn't encounter any overly cheap tricks. The best part of the game is how terrifying it can get--I jumped and screamed numerous times, and if you really get into it (sound up, lights low) I think you'll find this a good RPG/shooter with fantastic atmosphere.","April 2, 2014","true","23.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I don't know if it just a problem for just me or a problem with my pc. Maybe just an unlucky downloaded version?\n\nIf you want to see the first 10 minutes of the game, I have part one synced from my youtube to my steam videos.\n\nResident Evil 4 is an amazing game in general.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/randumbvanguard/recommended/254700/","randumbvanguard","The Vanguard King","http://steamcommunity.com/id/randumbvanguard/","163 products in account","I'm going to discuss the quality in this purchase in two ways: in the first paragraph I'll talk about how it is as a port, and on the second I'll talk about how the gameplay stands up.\nIn case you don't want to read the full review, I'll just come out: It's a bad port to a good game\n\nSo why is this a bad port? Well first of all, the automatic framerate is set to 60 fps. Now I run a good computer (flawlessly playing skyrim with 70 mods good) but when I played it with that setting the whole game slowed down. I felt like I was watching a slow-mo replay that never stopped. There really is no excuse for that from a ten year old game. I changed it from 60 to 30 fps, and it worked perfectly for me. HOWEVER, I noticed on the reviews some complained about headaches from the jumpiness of the framerate, which they say must have been below 30. Honestly, I didn't notice. I felt fine. So, if you're sensative to that kind of thing, be wary. But like I said, I didn't feel a change. The aiming also can get a bit janky, but honestly, the fact I can use the mouse made up for that. The other thing is that the controls can be REALLY weird. They were already weird on the gamecube, but hell: if you want to rotate an item in your inventory you have to use the "delete" button. And they never tell you. And you can't change it. (I'd be angry at Capcom for this impossible to guess choice of button, if it wasn't for the fact I was legitimately concerned with Capcom's mental well being. xD) Then there is the promise of HD textures. HD?! More like Hardly Different! AM I RIGHT, FOLKS?! But no, seriously, there is nothing HD about it. (That being said the standard graphics really aren't bad, so eh.)\n\nSo does this game hold up today? YES. Is it fun? YES. Does the poor quality of the port get in the way of fun too much? NO. Really, if this port is the only one you can get your hands on, you should get this (unless, of course, the headache issue above may be a problem for you). I was told that some of the later Resident Evil games (that I didn't play) became repetative and boring. Resident Evil 4 doesn't, and it does this a few ways: There is a constant difficulty, you always have to worry about a zombie flanking you, or just about the sheer force of the enemy; the enemies are often varried, not excessively, but enough that things are spiced up, and the level design is just really good. There is a section where you're in a castle for a long time, so the game designers are like, "You know what be cool... A room full of lava... And there are dragon flame thrower things... Bro... That'd be so cool." and then they did. And it was. (to be fair, this probably should have broken my immersion. It didn't. But it should have.\nIf a survival horror game has a lava-dragon room, you know repetitive environments are NOT an issue. xD\nThe shooting itself is a bit weird, only allowing you to move or shoot, not both. I feel like this is actually a really good choice, it makes it so where you position yourself is more important (Tactics!) and it means you have a steady enough aim to get proper headshots (Gore! Sometimes!). Ammo conservation is also a big deal if you're not careful, it can get really tense when you realize you don't have many shotgun rounds to fall back on.\nThe dialogue is literally the cheesiest thing I've ever heard, but it's one of those "so bad it's good" situations, and the story itself is... Okay, I suppose. You're certainly not going to be playing it for the story, anyway. You'll be playing for the gameplay. DID I MENTION THE GAMEPLAY IS GOOD? YES? AT LEAST FIVE TIMES? GOOD. LET ME TELL YOU A FEW MORE. This is a good game, it's just good. I had fun. It was a fun time.","July 11, 2014","true","7.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

I beat it four times, back to back. I love this game. It is, by far, my favorite, non-Zelda-game, of all time. This version; for Steam, I anticipated and even pre-ordered; something I swore I would never do again, after being burned on Aliens Colonial Marines. I pre-loaded this game as soon as I was able, and the moment it was released I played it....or, at least I tried to. The game runs in super slow mo whenever there are lighting effects visible. Leon’s run is at half what his walking speed should be. I tried everything to make the game run smoother. I set it to its lowest setting. Went so far as to run it in a tiny window with no anti-aliasing. Didn’t help. I run BioShock Infinite and Tomb Raider on Ultra with hardly any slow down, even in action intense sections. So, I know I don't have a problem with my hardware. What is the deal Capcom? Patch this nonsense NOW....pretty please. I want, so badly, to play this game again and relive all those magical days of calling in sick for work because I forgot to go to bed the night before -up all night playing. Fix this slowdown issue and I will forgive you and update my review to sing your praises.","February 28, 2014","false","0.8"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

However, if you are concerned about the PC port, keep reading.\n\nAt the time of writing this review, only the actual PC port was tested. Firstly, it is MUCH better then the original RE4 port however it is not perfect.\n\nThere are a few options which are pointless because they cripple your view. Motion blur makes you feel like you are drunk and the post-processing adds a black and white film-grainy filter to it. It is 3 different colours and it makes the game look worse.\n\nAlso on my AMD R7 250, I could not run the game in 60FPS on 1080p however it ran fine on 720p with the occassional drop. Yes this could be because my card is not amazing but what I am saying is that maybe it could be optimised to run at 60FPS better on lower end systems. Not everyone owns a monster-spec PC though Capcom!\n\nThe game has 2 frame rate settings, 60 and 30. If your computer cannot handle 60 then the frame rate will drop to 30 and because the FPS is connected to the speed, it will half the speed. The default settings reset button seems to be accurate enough though when it comes to optimising the game for you, which is a first!\n\nFinally, the mouse controls work fine however you cannot use the mouse in the inventory. Not a big deal but its fine. The game is still RE4 alright though and it is clear that it was taken seriously that the game was going to be ported. Keep in mind that you probably will need a high-end GPU in order to play 1080p/60FPS.\n\nOverall, Capcom has done a good job but there is still room for future performance patches to improve performance on lower end cards like my R7 250. However, I can report that overclocking my R7 250 ,which more-or-less increases the quality of the card so it is equal to the 7750, makes it run fine with AA off. Final verdict, the port is great.","February 27, 2014","true","23.1"," 27 of 49 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","27","49","0","5"

WIth over 100 hours logged on this game i would be lying if i said i dont know about this game. To start out, the game is a must play - but i want to focus about this release an "HD RE RELEASE".\n\nI own Resident Evil 4 on the PS2, Gamecube and the WII - and i also own the original release for the Computer. I have to admit -  the original computer release is best played with mods loaded to the brim. There's alot of HD Texture mods, HD High Poly Models, and everything that makes it look so much better than this so called "HD Version". HOWEVER - this version is made for the computer - with Native high res support for 1080p, Native mouse and keyboard support and the game runs at a very steady 60fps. However, this is a complete rework of the game, so for me - that means all of my awesome mods that ran on the game before the HD Verison release - will no longer work.\n\nTo get to the point, This HD version release is great, if you want RE4 in 1080p, 60fps greatness, with leaderboards and slightly updated textures to boot. I recommend. So good.","March 22, 2014","true","29.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

She's been kidnapped and brought to a village\nsomewhere in Spain. And Leon soon realizes not everything is normal in\nthis village.\n\nThis Re-release of Resident Evil 4 has been given the name Ultimate HD Edition,\nand features revamped textures, all of the bonus contents previously released\non other platforms and improved PC controlls.\n\n--RREVIEW--\n\nFirst off I will start by saying that Resident Evil 4 was one of my favorite games\nduring my childhood. I loved the hell out of that game. Unfortunately\nI sold my old GameCube system many years ago, so when I saw\nthey were going to release it on Steam, I was genuinely happy,\nI could finally play it again, and it was the Ultimate edition.\n\nWe need to understand that we're talking about a 8-9 year old game,\nand think back to when this game was released, this game\nbroke bounderies for graphics and gameplay back then,\nand there's actually a limit to what they really can do with\nthis re-release. This is not Resident Evil 4 with Crysis graphics,\nit's the same good old engine as the original.\n\nThe textures has been improved slightly, but there are HD\nmods out there that gives you even better textures.\n\nThe gameplay is same as the original, clumsy-tank controls\nwhich adds the feeling of claustrophobia and panic when the\nzombies (Los Ganados) surrounds you.\nIn 2014, we're used to tight responsive controls for the PC,\nso many will not like these old'days tank controls.\n\nTank controls means there's a design aspect where you\ncan't look or turn around using your mouse. To turn around\nand change your walking direction you need to use your\nA and D keys. For many this will bring frustration and agony,\nfor others it's perfect game design which improves upon\nthe scare of the game.\n\nThis is still to-date (based on personal feelings) the best\nResident Evil game made, and this Re-release stays true\nto the original game mechanics and controls.\n\nIt took me around 12 hours to finish this game, after completing\nthe game once, you unlock 3 types of mini-games, "Separate Ways"\nwhich lets you play as Ada Wong and see her side of the main story\nspanning 5 stages, "Ada's Assignment" is a small minigame with\n1 stage only where you need to run around collecting stuff and\nfighting the Los Ganados, and then there's the "Mercenaries"\ngame which is a type of enemy-wave mode where you need\nto kill as many Ganados as you can within a time limit.\n\nThe objective is to get the highest score possible, and based\non your completion and glory you get to unlock more\ncharacters to use in that game mode, this game mode\nalso features 4 different stages.\n\nCompleting these mini games will award you with\ncostume unlocks for the main characters during the\nmain story game. After completing the game once\nyou also unlock the New Game option, where you\nstart over again but with the equipment, ammo and weapons\nyou had from your previous playthrough.\n\nThe game did have problems at launch, several performance\nproblems, basic elements in the game menu was missing,\nlike Audio Options, unlogical PC control layout for\ninventory management and Quick-Time-Events.\n\n---CONCLUTION---\n\nThis game will easily provide you with 17-25 hours\nof enjoyment (main story + mini games), and even\nmore hours if you decide to do a New Game playthrough.\n\nThe game is a classic, and the game mechanics and controls\nis not like the new modern games. If you're a veteran of\nRE4 and have played the original releases, you will\nmost likely love this new re-release, but if you're new\nto this game, you might find the graphics and\ngameplay disappointing.\n\nThe asking price is 20€. I think it is a tad too high\nfor a 8-9 year old game. So you have to decide for yourself\nif the price is worth it. For me it was.\n\n---SCORE---\n\nI feel it's unfair to compare the graphics up\nagainst today's eyecandy games like Metro: Last Light,\nCrysis and Battlefield, so the graphics score will be\nbased on how good it is compared to how good it COULD\nhave been for this re-release.\n\nBecause of a troubled launch, and some major\nunlogical PC control decisions, this takes a big negative\nhit on the Gameplay score.\n\nGraphics: 7/10\nStory: 7/10\nGameplay: 6/10\nValue: 8/10\n\nScore: 7.0/10","April 8, 2014","true","14.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Press M for the map screen, wait 2 seconds then it should be back to smooth. Instead of alt-tabbing out. Haven't crashed like this.||||||||||||||||||||\n\n\nHaving only played the gamecube version of this game with at least 75+ hours clocked in when I was younger, I expect a lot. I expect a lot especially as the first port, that I actually have, ended up as garbage. lol\n\nI saw that this game is being updated with its bug fixes/add ons which makes it feel promising so I decided to buy it. I loved RE4 too much not to give this a try.\n\n\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFirst off, having played RE5/RE6 where the controllers are smoother on pc, I feel spoiled. I won't take away/bad talk  RE4 due to the fact that they are trying to keep this game as close as possible to the original which I can appreciate(or at least I Think they are).\n\nYou can't move/strafe while aiming, you have to aim to reload,  the movement feels old (it came out in 05 lol)\nStuff like that is something I will just get used to.\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\n\n\nPOSITIVES\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFortunately, you can change the key binds. I already hated using "E" as a action button. I switched that to "F".\n\nThe 60 FPS and graphics looks sexy as ♥♥♥♥.\n\nAfter a good 20 minutes, the controls felt smooth, they feel almost exactly how I played on the gamecube. The "modern" aiming style is phenomenal. The only thing that scared me was the first QTE from the boulder run, made me smash X with XC to dodge.\n\nUPDATE: Just started 2-2 and I cannot complain. So far I am loving this game! The controllers feel great after you get used to them and aiming does not feel restricted! The team could not have done a better job.\n\nUPDATE: The team really out-did itself by listening to the community and fixing the bugs! They remade the game enjoyable and I love them for it.\n\n\n\nNEGATIVES\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nA negative I found is using the inventory. Maybe I haven't figured it out yet but using the inventory is a pain already lol. I don't want to have to move my hand from my mouse just to move stuff around. Yes, call me lazy but thats just me.\n\nYou have to deal with Ashley again lol\n\nThe audio-desync started happening near the ending scenes. I'm sure they will fix this tho as they have fixed more than half the game already.\n\nSeperate Ways movie clips look like complete ♥♥♥ lol\n\nPOSSIBLE BUGS\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nAfter I save, the frame rate dropped to 30 but since the settings are on "60", the game speed was just cut in half. All I did was alt-tab and it would be start working normal again. This was from the first save typewriter, the ones after that were normal without bugging out.\n\nI have been having a lot more FPS drops/"slomo"bug. My game will become really slow/drop to 30fps but all I have to do is alt-tab out and alt-tab back in.\n\nIt seems that the FPS drop/"slow mo" keeps getting worse and worse. It happens often anytime I switch the screens like say I go to the merchant or just simply press tab. Of course all I do is alt-tab back in but that crashed my game once so now I'm scared. This is something that should be looked into and fixed ASAP.\n\nMy pc specs are\nAMD Phenom x4 965 OC'ed to 3.8ghz\n8gb DDR3 Kingstong HyperX ram at 1333mhz\nMSI Twin Frozr III GTX 560 TI 448 core","April 26, 2014","true","36.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

With a terrible and hopeless port of RE4 being released years ago, I thought this'd never become a reality. I squealed like a weeaboo teenage girl when I saw the pre-orders in the steam updates popup.\n\nUpon release my heart was broken, as was the game itself. The aiming went all over the place and made the act of playing the game stressful as all hell, and I'd realised that I'd given all my hopes up for something that was probably asking too much in the first place. There would be no perfect edition of Resident Evil 4. Such is life, such is the way of porting games from nearly ten years ago...\n\nBut then, to my surprise, they came out with a patch not a week later. A new aiming mode? All the aiming issues are fixed in both modes, you say? I was so genuinely surprised that in one simple patch they managed to fix every single issue I encountered. Pure ecstasy, and all my friends who were put off in the beginning were once again interested. But then I started encountering new issues with the game, for instance 'struggle' QTEs were hard as balls to pull off like I could in the console versions. Suddenly, here come the beta patches. Pretty much any issue I encounter gets targeted and I'm very grateful for that.\n\nHonestly, I'm sat here still letting it sink in that one of my favourite games got a successful makeover for current operating systems. The game looks and feels fantastic at high resolutions and framerates, although I had to turn motion blur off because it's not the best kind of blur. Only thing I could say is that I'm disappointed that it doesn't have the crosshair aiming system from the PC version of Resident Evil 5, especially since that functionality was in the Wii edition, but you can easily look past that and in the end it's still easily the best version of RE4 on the market today.\n\nThank you Capcom! This is easily the happiest I've been with a release in a long time. And I hope you continue to support this game and hopefully allow some form of modding community access to the game, just to keep breathing life into it.","May 1, 2014","true","80.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Everything about it from the cheesy scenes, the gun animations, the merchant, the boss battles, the other characters is just wonderful.  I just love everything about this game.\n\nIt's a 3rd person action/adventure I suppose, the horror from past games isn't really here.  There is also the Mercenaries mode, professional mode and a slew of add ons made after the original release on Gamecube that gives this game an insane amount of conrent.  The game isn't really scary like former RE games but it's so much fun to play.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/0skulock/recommended/254700/","0skulock","Oskulock","http://steamcommunity.com/id/0skulock/","988 products in account","Resident Evil 4 (Also known as Biohazard 4 in Japan), is a third-person shooter/survival horror video game developed by Capcom Productions in 2005. It's a departure in the long running series and is considered to be a forerunner in the third-person shooter genre, making many enhancements to the established gameplay that have later become a standard.\nThe game was released with a massively positive reception, winning multiple game of the year awards from different publicizations around the globe.\n\nWhen it comes to gameplay, RE4 takes the clunky controls from the original games and throws them into garbage bin. The camera is set up behind the main character and you can aim in full 3D, you can't however move while you're aiming. A brilliant idea from the developers, since this combined with the rather difficult aiming mechanic makes up for some truly terrifying situations where you have to aim precisely on the different pressure points the enemies have. You can pop their heads off, shoot them in the legs to make them fall and preserve ammunition by stabbing them, among various other things like explosives and disabling them by shooting their hands to remove their weaponry.\n\nRegardless, RE4 is a lot more action packed than the previous iterations in the series and therefore isn't as chilling. This, however, is compensated by some truly amazing set pieces and some of the best pacing you will EVER see in a video game. You will never have a dull moment playing this game, and if you already haven't, you should.\n\nSo is there really something you can criticize about this game? Certainly! It doesn't have a memorable soundtrack, most of it is ambient which does fit the moody atmosphere quite well but isn't something i'd personally listen to while i go jogging in the morning. Speaking about atmosphere, the game does something unexpected a little bit after the halfway of the game. And, without spoiling anything goes absolutely INSANE.\nThis however, is not an issue if you dont mind campy stuff. But will be a big problem to people who were enjoying the extremely serious and atmospheric nature of the game for the first 12 hours.\n\nGiant spanish robot midget Napoleon, what the ♥♥♥♥ Capcom!?:D\n\nIn the end, even 9 years after the release, this is a game YOU whoever you are should be playing. It's a horror/action classic that will never be forgotten and will be admired and imitated for years to come.\n\nPS. Since this is a review of the Ultimate HD Edition, i should note that the port is fine. But you shouldn't even consider getting this unless you have an X360 Controller for PC. The mouse and keyboard controls are absolutely awful.","November 7, 2014","true","15.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Many people agree that Resident Evil 4 was the grand departure from the original Resident Evil formula. This was the change from a fixed camera angle approach to a over-the-shoulder. This in my mind heightend every mechanic from the previous iterations. Let me tell you that I was a rather large fan of Resident Evil 2 until 4 came out. Resident Evil 4 captures both the essence of fear and lonelyness in the most true essence. From the vast open villages of the Las Plagas hosts to the long twisting tunnels of the Castle Salazar, this game screams atmosphere. Every moment they player is engaged, he is graces with spiking tunes and the spooky ambiance set by the expertly composed score of this game.

Capcom is giving appropriate attention to giving the PC heads a proper HD port!!! We can all forget that last one >_>\n\nPerformance: Runs great on my system, however I have heard others having performance issues. I am able to run in max settings at a stable 60 frames through out! No frame loss through out.\nInput: They nailed the K/M controls. X360 controls are the same as they were on consoles, I personally have forgotten my controller completely when playing on K/M. However, if you plan on playing with K/M unplug any other controllers as the input detection seems glitchy.\n\nGood/Bad?\nOkay, I'm a little biased here because Resident Evil 4 is my absolute favorite game of all time. But, this is an OK port. The game itself is still all there in all it's glory, but the small performance issues I've read up on, and the glitching controls for when you try and use K/M when controllers are plugged in is a bit disheartening that Capcom got lazy with it. Worth the purchase if you loved the Resident Evil series, and if you don't have a console and have yet to experience this amazing game?

Resident Evil 4 came out in 2005 on the Gamecube, and eventually landed on PS2, XBOX 360, Wii, probably PS3 and original XBOX as well. Now, it's been released on Steam 9 years later, and it's selling like hot cakes for a reason. This is the FIRST Resident Evil game I ever played, and I originally didn't want to bother with it. "What? No zombies? Screw that, sounds lame, it's not even FPS!" I said, but my good friend told me "Nah man, you have to try it. I know what you mean, but here I am, RE2 is my favourite in the series, but I still love RE4 as well!" So I tried it, and of course, it has become one of my all time favourite games. I've since played the first Resident Evil, Code: Veronica, Outbreak File 1 and 2, RE5... and that sixth one... ugh... and well, RE4 is my favourite, with RE5 probably coming 2nd, and the original at 3rd. I'm sure if I played through the RE2, it'd probably come in at 3rd or maybe even beat RE5 for 2nd.\n\nIt's truly unfortunate that RE5 has become more of a 3rd person action game rather than a survival horror, and RE6 was just... blegh... HOW DO YOU SCREW UP ZOMBIES?! Anyways, I find RE4 still retains much of the survival horror that the more recent releases are lacking. It has a decent amount of firearms (Not as many as RE5, but there is still a nice selection), I love the inventory system even if it is outright unrealistic, and the characters are very well rounded. Voice acting, atmosphere, good puzzles, the only things I can say that I hate about the game is some of the Quick Time Events. Also, some of the firearms in the game don't shoot the ammo that is given, however that can be overlooked.\n\nI do like to pay extra attention to realism in games, however RE4 is so much fun, I easily look past the few unrealistic qualities it has. Even if you're a diehard FPS gamer like I am, even if you're really anal about realism like I am, even if you think RE5 and RE6 are leading to the death of the series (IMO, RE5 was saved by the co-op gameplay, interesting inventory system and selection of firearms, however RE6 is outright disappointing), I believe you will still find some fun in RE4 if you haven't yet tried it out. The replayability is amazing, there's LOTS of stuff to unlock, and there is most certainly a challenge if that's what you're looking for. Especially when you unlock Professional mode. There are many memorable scenes, characters that you will genuinely become interested in and come to love or hate, and there are a multitude of ways in which you can approach a situation instead of just go in and start shooting.\n\nOh yeah, in this rendition of RE4, they really went all out with how the game looks. If you have a high-end computer, you can have 60 frames per second, and HD quality visuals. I have a tower that's about a year old and doens't have anything special in it, so I had to bring it back down to 30 frames per second (You can change it in Options on the main menu), and I also turned off the Anti-Aliasing... which I'm not gonna lie, I have no idea what it does in the first place. All I know is when I tried to play it at max settings, the game was basically stuck in slow-mo. Quite annoying. I just turned down some of the graphical options, and it runs almost perfectly :) ... wow, 4 paragraphs. Sorry for typing so much, I hope this helped you decide whether to pick the game up or not. In the end, I can't think of very many reasons NOT to get it lol Like I said, the replayability is there, and if you want to unlock everything, you'll get over 40 hours worth, minimum.\n\nLike I said, there's challenge there if you want it, but if you're more casual and just want to experience the story, or if you're just not used to the unique controls of Resident Evil, then easy mode will be a good way to get past the learning curve without too much hastle.

For some, it might have made the series a bit worse, for diverting from it's survival horror roots and more. However, I disagree on that idea. For while RE5 and RE6 might have gone far from it's roots, RE4 at least still has it's parallels to keep intact with the preceeding titles. Survival horror changes it's gears to action horror in this installment, although it retains a lot of the original Resident Evil flavour - typewriters and odd puzzles remaining in the core.\n\nRE4 is a great title. This new PC edition is a godsend for it's HD abilities, and the fact that it overwrites the previous PC port that was god awful. I loved this game ever since I first played it. If you haven't bought the game yet, then buy it! It's not as outlandish as 5 and 6, instead having a nice charm to it's somewhat cheesy nature with our hero Leon.\n\nStuff to keep in mind is the fact that subtitles aren't available for English players, albeit it seems the other versions of RE4 didn't have English subtitles either way.\n\nAlso, this could just be me but, while this game has a decent 60fps lock on it, the game often slows down. The frame rate drops to about 40-50, and everything acts like Bullet Time from Max Payne is enabled. It does go away though. What's up with that? I'm sure it's just a problem on my part though.\n\nIn the end, RE4's new HD PC port is worthwhile to get. As the time of writing, it's on sale! For an astounding $6, no less. Cop it as soon as possible!","March 26","true","16.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","5","7","2","6"

The character models are clear and crisp, with minimal faults in animation.\nThe music suits the game, it flows well with the ambiance of each area. Sound effects are well-done also.\nResident Evil 4 takes around 10-15 hours to complete. After you have completed the main game you are rewarded with three extra game modes. Separate Ways serves to delve deeper into the plotline of the game, taking you deeper into the story and showing the player that not everything that occurs throughout is coincidental.

The Mercenaries is a mini game where the player has to kill enemies to earn points before the evacuation chopper arrives in the allotted time.\nBy completing these extra game modes, weapons become available in the main game and Separate Ways, coercing the player into numerous replays in order to obtain all of them.\nIf you do not already own Resident Evil 4, I can highly recommend that you buy it.

It works and plays beautifully, even if the 60fps conversion makes some of Leon's animations look hilarious (Gotta QTE fast!). There are no audio options to speak of whatsoever, and surround mixing appears limited to 2 channels. This is still a game defined by its very distinct tank style controls. A gamepad is necessary because it feels right, and because mouse and keyboard does not (as in, it tries to mimic the gamepad through acceleration and it just feels off). Texture work is cleaned up considerably and the image is properly scaled to 16:9. This is still a GameCube remaster so don't expect the world, but I've a fondness for graphics from that era anyway so everything looks fine to me.

Action, exploration and setpiece are carefully balanced and generously doled out with each passing moment. There is zero filler. Tension? Ever present and punctuated by moments of calm and recollection. That amazing 'Serenity' track during safe zones. Variety? You could be careening down a minecart in one moment; fighting your way out of a kill box in the next; be hunted by invisible predators down sewage tunnels; or solve any number of the simple but rewarding puzzles. There is rarely a repeated scenario, and if there is, it's subtly tweaked and inserted where you wouldn't expect it, which takes us to another point: gameplay.

The flow of battle is incredible too. You can efficiently shoot heads off, but the plagas that may sprout throw a wrench into your plan. You can line up a rifle shot and clear out rows of enemies like bowling pins. You can incapacitate a leg and go for Leon's suplex (still some of the simplest but most satisfying combos in games). Or you may deliberately time a roundhouse attack for its i-frames. Swapping between attache case and real-time action may seem cumbersome, but it actually affords an almost turn-based pacing to the encounters as you quickly dive into your inventory to swap for a grenade in the heat of the moment - think Parasite Eve on PSX.\n\nRE4 has it all: ageless gameplay, masterful pacing, a cast of exceptionally dumb RE villains and most of all, THE GREATEST reload animations ever.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jbaketkd/recommended/254700/","jbaketkd","Vash(88)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jbaketkd/","787 products in account","What can I say about this game that most people don't already know?  It was the first over the shoulder attempt in the Resident Evil series and without a doubt the best of the three.  RE5 had the co-op to hold it together, and RE6 was just a joke.  RE4 pushes the limits from time to time, but Leon still feels vulnerable enough to leave a sense of survival behind -- unlike RE5 and 6.  Both difficulties, if played in order, give the player an extremely well balanced game.  Get your knife ready, because you are going to need it!\n\nThe game-play in RE4 is awesome; however, if the player is stepping back from RE5 or 6, then the character will feel a bit clunky at first.  The enemies are also a bit more responsive than in RE5, which keeps the player on his/her toes.  There is a good variety of enemies for each section of the game, and the progression as well as the pacing is spot on.  This game also has better exploration than its follow-ups. Some parts actually require the player to back track in order to acquire certain weapons if he/she does not want to buy them from the merchant.\n\nThe idea of a giant escort mission can sometimes turn people away, but this game creates the perfect setting for such a task, and it also paces the escorting so that it does not become repetitive or annoying.  The escorting brings a feeling of co-op from time to time which helps keep the game interesting.\n\nThe inventory system in this game is hands down the most enjoyable of all the RE titles.  Leon is given  an upgradable backpack that the player can organize to the way he/she sees fit.  The weapons are also upgradable and numerous -- for an RE title.\n\nOver all, this game is well paced, action packed and well designed -- occasionally a little cliche or cheesy.  The PC version doesn't offer much beyond a sharper resolution and better controls for those that prefer a mouse and keyboard, but the game is still worth $20 in my eyes.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=236890077","April 6, 2014","true","33.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

At first I thought I wasted my money. After some settings, the game is fine.\n\nThe controls of this game is little different from recent games. I played this game long ago on PC with only keyboard. Now I tried it with keyboard+mouse. The mouse is not working like recent games. You use keyboard to turn right-left not mouse. Even gamepad controlling is different from recent games, which you use right stick to turn your face and walking direction. On this game, gamepad is like keyboard, you use left stick (or d-pad) for walking and turning direction. I strongly recommend a gamepad.\n\nI am using x360ce to emulate the XBOX gamepad. Hook mode is Normal.\n\nThis is a old game. Even if they say "HD" it is old. Thus, don't buy this game for graphics. Graphic performance is terrible. On default settings, the game is unplayable. I set the frame rate 30, motion blur off, and antialiasing off. Now it is fine.","June 28, 2014","true","22.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Now that I've forced my way through that roadblock, I can see that this is as fun of a game now as everyone had said it was when it came out.  Like everything before RE6, this is tank controls, stand still to aim.  You have to be mindful of your lack of sidestep, which has gotten me axed to the face a few times.\n\nQTEs still kind of annoying, though.  Switching from mashing X to pressing L+R is kind of hard for me, and smashing the stick back and forth is not great either.\n\nHaving fun overall, though.  I speared a fish, and ate it.  I killed a snake, took the golden egg it was gaurding/had eaten whole, and sold it.

It works great with KB+M or a 360 controller so you can use what suits you best. All is well so far but there are some problems which I have to mention.\n\n1. The textures aren't upgraded much so the visuals will not blow your mind\n\n2. When reloading the bolt-action rifle the fps had a drop (despite being locked at 60FPS) but quickly went back to 60\n\n3. The climbing up from ledges Quick Time Events to prevent falling are almost impossible to complete on the first try (or the 10 next attempts) and could potentially lead to damaging the buttons on your keyboard or controller you have to mash to complete them (Chapter 4-3 ledge climb and the chase sequence in 4-4 are the biggest offenders)\n\nIf you have trouble with the QTEs I mentioned above, lock the frame rate to 30 via the config.ini, find the part that says variableframerate, change the number from 60 to 30, complete QTE and change it back after you've done it.\n\nThe config.ini is located at: C:\Users\yourname\Documents\My Games\Capcom\RE4\n\nAlso the cutscene quality in the Separate ways bonus campaign is rubbish but not in the main game which is weird as several of the cutscenes are reused from the main game.\n\nDespite these issues I'd still recommend the game if you've never played RE4.\n\nPersonal rating: 7/10","September 21, 2014","true","31.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Kennedy from Resident Evil 2 as you search for the President's Daughter.\n\nUnlike earlier Resident Evil games, 4 was the first one to adopt a Third Person perspective. Unlike 5 and the later games however, it plays like the originals.\n\nYou have limited inventory space, but you don't deal with it in real time. Unlike 5, you have an Attache Case that can hold limited items, but you can move and switch the items in the case to take full effect of it.  You must guard Ashely, but she doesn't have an inventory and her AI isn't atrocious.\n\nWhile more action focused, the game is still quite scary, and it's atmosphere is pretty amazing, if slightly bland at times. The only real drawback to the game is it's color pallette, but the Steam version has 4 color filters you can play with, if you want to.\n\nThe original PC version of Resident Evil 4 was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed nightmare. No mouse aiming (you had to aim with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ED KEYPAD), holding space to run, and all sorts of ♥♥♥♥ed controls. The Steam release is a port of the PS3/360 version, which in itself is a port of the Wii version. Since the classic Resident Evils aren't on Steam (RE:REmake is almost here!), this is the best Resident Evil game on Steam. 5 is 4, except watered down, and 6 is just god awful.

It was the first over the shoulder attempt in the Resident Evil series and without a doubt the best of the three.  RE5 had the co-op to hold it together, and RE6 was just a joke.  RE4 pushes the limits from time to time, but Leon still feels vulnerable enough to leave a sense of survival behind -- unlike RE5 and 6.  Both difficulties, if played in order, give the player an extremely well balanced game.  Get your knife ready, because you are going to need it!\n\nThe game-play in RE4 is awesome; however, if the player is stepping back from RE5 or 6, then the character will feel a bit clunky at first.  The enemies are also a bit more responsive than in RE5, which keeps the player on his/her toes.  There is a good variety of enemies for each section of the game, and the progression as well as the pacing is spot on.  This game also has better exploration than its follow-ups. Some parts actually require the player to back track in order to acquire certain weapons if he/she does not want to buy them from the merchant.\n\nThe idea of a giant escort mission can sometimes turn people away, but this game creates the perfect setting for such a task, and it also paces the escorting so that it does not become repetitive or annoying.  The escorting brings a feeling of co-op from time to time which helps keep the game interesting.\n\nThe inventory system in this game is hands down the most enjoyable of all the RE titles.  Leon is given  an upgradable backpack that the player can organize to the way he/she sees fit.  The weapons are also upgradable and numerous -- for an RE title.\n\nOver all, this game is well paced, action packed and well designed -- occasionally a little cliche or cheesy.  The PC version doesn't offer much beyond a sharper resolution and better controls for those that prefer a mouse and keyboard, but the game is still worth $20 in my eyes.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=236890077","April 6, 2014","true","33.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The textures have been sharpened nicely, the lighting effects are pretty, and the water reflections are more noticeable.\n\nAs a diehard RE fan, I believe 4 was the last amazing installment in the entire series considering it was at this point where the games core mechanics drastically changed, ie, third person, elimination of top-down camera angles that only altered upon entering different rooms (which I miss desperately because they increased the sense of fear and suspense throughout  playing, even though there were critics who believed this point of view made controls more difficult), combat moves such as kicking Ganados when they're stunned, weapon upgrades, collecting relics worth money TO upgrade/modify/buy weapons, inventory size, etc; the list goes on and on.  Ultimately, though, RE 4 is an excellent game that introduced a plethora of features never before seen or utilized in the series prior to this installment.  It was a fantastic game on the Gamecube, PS2 and yes, it's even better for the PC when you take into the consideration that, if your PC can handle it, the 60 fps makes an enormous difference in your gameplay.\n\nMy only con with the game so far is the mouse and keyboard controls.  I realize this is just preference and can be fixed by using a 360 controller, which I intend on doing, but overall these controls are difficult to adjust to at first.\n\nOther than that, what are you waiting for?

Switching from mashing X to pressing L+R is kind of hard for me, and smashing the stick back and forth is not great either.\n\nHaving fun overall, though.  I speared a fish, and ate it.

Residet Evil 4 was a game changer in the same sence that Metal Gear Solid for the original Playstation was. I owned this game when it was first released for gamecube back around New Years 2005. Having recently played through the game, I can honestly say that no game, in my opinion, has been able to top this. This game is a must own, especially for anyone who has not had the honor of playing through it.\n\nThe HD graphics aren't that much of an upgrade over the original release, but considering tis is essentially a gamecube title, The artwork definitely holds up.\n\nIf you experience slowdowns with the locked 60fps option (and you will), you should try playing at 30fps. The framerate consistency is well worth it.","September 21, 2014","true","20.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","3"

RE4 is still a fun game and is overall a very enjoyable experience.\n\nMechanically, it all works as expected. The graphics aren't fantastic or anything, but definitely playable. About what you'd expect from a 10 year old remaster. The controls are wonky in that Resident Evil way, but the game is built around them so they work well enough.\n\nHonestly, if you're reading this, you've probably already played RE4 and you're just wondering if the HD PC version is good. It is.\n\nIf you haven't played it before, you're in for a pretty good time. With Separate Ways (a mini campaign unlocked after beating the game), it took me about 18 hours.

I did however have a couple problems that should be noted. First off, the mouse movement was a little difficult to get used to it felt delayed and slow to me. Second, whenever I hit intense moments in the game the sound would cut in and out repeatedly until I left to a new area. After searching, I didn't find any fix for it, I don't know if anyone else has had this issue but I felt like I should note it. As far as how improved the game is from its earlier versions, the textures are noticably polished, the game will look better, however, I was not THAT impressed with how much better it looked, but it is noticable. Other than that, I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to relive that bit of nostalgia, or for the newcomer to the series!","December 20, 2014","true","14.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

And I do mean only a "bit" more. Feels like CAPCOM really didn't put much effort into making more textures, Since only character/enemy and maybe some boss enemy textures were redone, a few weapons and items look better, but I'd prefer more fidelity in making the whole game look better, rather than some of it's parts. There are a couple of guys doing a WHOLE retexture project, but as of now, it's still ~40% done at the moment. Might take a year or more for them to finish it, so I'd say do not rush it, and get it at a better sale price. 60fps setting does make the game run very smoothly, combat feels even more responsive than ever and it definitely helps with the signature clunky "tank" controls.\n\nHowever, if you by some random magical reason haven't played Resident Evil 4. Buy it, it's really worth it's price, especially for someone that hasn't played it at all.\n\nIf you by chance do get this game, but want a little bit more out of the visuals, and don't want to do any heavy modding, you can always use SweetFX 1.5.1 (latest version). You can easily get this even from Skyrim Nexus, since you only need the base files. Either use the default settings, or browse in google for some player created presets (found at least 5-6 in the first seconds of searching) and find a preset to your liking.\n\nI highly recommend you check out http://residentevilmodding.boards.net/board/62/re4-modification-releases\n\nThere are numerious ENB presets, SweetFX presets available. Also get the shader fix, which makes the game look A LOT better.\n\nEven if CAPCOM is lazy, doesn't mean that you can't make the game look better with a little bit of elbow grease.","January 15, 2015","true","21.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

In 2005 Capcom changed the formula and released Resident Evil 4 which began the action series as well as inspiring games such as Dead Space.\n\nPlotYou play as Leon S. Kennedy, a former police rookie (resi 2), now US secret agent tasked with rescuing the president's daughter (Ashley) from a group of cultists. In the remote european village, Leon discovers that there are far greater forces at play here and a sinister plot which threatens the world.\n\nGameplayGameplay is the main highlight here. The game is presented as a third-person shooter, like later installments. Levels compose of areas which the player must go through until they reach the end. Each area has enemies and traps hinder your progress. There are a wide variety of enemies including, but not limited to: dogs, melee/range guys, flying insects etc. Further more, there is a wide cast of bosses and mini bosses which each require different strategies and tactics to takedown. To assist you, there  are typewriters which you can use to save the game. A merchant may be also located in the area, which allows to to buy new weapons, upgrades as well as sell item like treasures to. Such weapons include pistols, magnums, snipers, smg, shotguns and grenades (explosive, flames and flash). Ammo is not sold by the merchant, so you need to preserve what little you have and scavenge the area for more. It is highly recommended that you only stick to upgrdaing 2-3 weapons as it is impossible to accumulate enough money to upgrade them all. Like many resident evil games, you have an inventory that is used to store items like weapons, attatchments, ammo and herbs. You have limited space, which can be expanded via upgrades. At the end of the level a cutscene will play signalling the end of one level in the chapter and the begining of another. I completed the campaign in about 18-20 hours, but there is plenty of replayability here with new difficulties and playing with only certain weapons (as well as newly unlocked ones). Completing the campaign unlocks a new difficulty, new weapons, new costumes, raid mode, theatre mode, the mini game :"Assignment Ada" as well as the expansion 'Seperate Ways'. One of the negative points I found with the game (especially with 5) were the quick time events. Such events occur so quickly that it is difficult to press the correct keys on time, which usually results in death (especially during cutscenes) or taking alot of damage. At on point in the game I was forced to lower the FPS to 30, in order for my 'button mashes' to register in game. Such events I found detracted the game, and ruined the overall flow of gameplay. What was further frustrating was that the key inputs would be randomised so it is difficult to predict which were the right keys to press until it was too late.\n\nAudioThe sound is great. Weapons sound powerful. Voice acting ranges from decent to bad. Leon's voice as well as a few characters are decent. While ashley's voice is irritating. Music is played when enemies are present in the area and only turns off when all enemies are defeated. This feature is indicates when you should be vigilant or relaxed.\n\nControlsControls are passable. The game uses tank controls, meaning that you can't move and shoot at the same time. It is much more clunky than resident evil 5,rev and 6. You can switch the mouse control schemes to original or modern, which affects how fast you aim with the mouse. movement is slower than resi 5,rev and 6, however this is compensated by the fact that enemies are much slower than later entries in the series.\n\nGraphicsThe graphics range between decent to subpar. The HD release improved some of the textures in the game, such as some trees. However, other textures were left untouched. Furthermore, the character textures have been improved slightly and are less rigid. You can choose to switch beteen the HD and old graphics at any time. There are also a few colour filters available from the get go, which change the look and feel of the game. Overall, I found the graphics worster than rei 5,rev and 6.\n\nExtrasBesides the main campaign there is also: Mecenaries, Assignment Ada and Seperate ways. If you are unfamiliar with resident evil, mecenraies is a mod first introduced in resident evil 3. You select from a range of characters which each have a unique loadout of weapons and equipment. The aim is to survive against waves of enemies until the timer reaches zero, whereby you get extracted to safety. Each map hold a variety of crates, herbs, ammo etc which can be collected. You start with only one character selectable (Leon), with new characters unlocked when you earn enough stars in each stage. Compared with resi 5 and 6, there is only a limited number of characters and stages available. Furthermore, unlike later entries, you can't play this mode with a friend (ie no co-op)\n\nAssignment ADA is basically a mini game unlocked after completing the main game. You play as ADA (obviously), in a non-canon story whereby you are tasked to collect virus samples located in the area. Unlike the the main game and seperate ways, there are no save points in this game mode so you have to complete it in one run. This also forces the player to conserve ammo and look for herbs to keep in the fight. There are enemies in each area that you have to take out. At the end of the mode, you will face a boss. Completing this mode also unlocks a new weapon in Seperate Ways. Should you die, you will have to start from the very begining of the mode.\n\nSeperate ways is basically an expansion, where by you look into Ada's motives in the main game. You play as Ada Wong (resi 2), a Chinese American agent, working for a secretive organisation, tasked with retrieving a sample of the virus. The levels are set during the main game, showing how she came to be in the main game. You start with a set of weapons, which have already bean leveled up a bit. Unlike Assignment Ada, you can save the game by accessing type writers. You can also buy weapons and gear from the merchant, but you are unable to upgrade weapons. It is shorter than the campaign and yet longer than Assignment Ada. Completing this mode will unlock new costumes and weapons in the main campaign as well as cutscenes to view in theatre.\n\nFinal ThoughtsIf you want are a resident evil fan or want a good action game with more horror elements than what resi 5 and 6 had to offer and don't mind, quick time events and old control schemes, then resident evil 4 is right up your alley.","April 13, 2015","true","29.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

One doing so your mission becomes escape the cult group the Los Illuminados. They’re technically not zombies in this game they are infected with a parasite called Las Plagas.\n\nThe Gameplay is as follows: you run along a path to a locked door, you then proceed  to have to find a key. Once you find said key the area will now flood with enemies. Rinse and repeat for about 11ish hours. It works and well it seems to be the Resident Evil thing to do. It does get kind of repetitive but later on.\n\nThe Graphics: They are pretty good maybe even great. But I did notice the game slowed down for me once entering the final area for a little bit but that was about it. The cutscenes look almost like the gameplay graphics. The graphics may look dated to some but it’s okay to me.\n\nThe Bad: Ammo can be scarce. Bosses can be a bit more challenging than most games. They added an Easy Mode for the main story.(What kind of weak ♥♥♥ shit is that?) Once you get Ashley you might as well have the game become one long ♥♥♥ escort mission. Not a lot of replayability once you obtain all the good items.\n\nOverall/Final Score: This game is overall really good I recomend it but the bad aspects might turn off some gamers from this great game definitely worth 20$ or even wait for it to get it on sale. I give it a 8.4/10 some flaws but overall a good game.","January 4, 2015","true","25.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/beeedup/recommended/254700/","beeedup","no shirt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/beeedup/","492 products in account","I have played through Resident Evil 4 probably fifteen times, and before I die I will probably play through it fifteen more. It's the kind of game that always feels good to play--it has challenging but masterable combat mechanics, an addicting weapon upgrade system, and most importantly, wonderful level design and environments. There's no respectable story to speak of, which makes the game all the more remarkable since it manages to snare the player solely on the merits of its design and mechanics.\n\nThe main reason I keep playing Resident Evil 4 is because I enjoy being in the game's environments. Sure, there are a lot of locations in the game that are absolutely miserable, but those locations are an essential half of a contrasting environment dynamic the Resident Evil games have always deployed. To build tension and horror, Resident Evil games cram the player into dark, cramped, filthy places, and it's only after the player has managed to make it through these uncomfortable spaces that they are rewarded with a "safe" space, usually an area with a typewriter (for saving games) and no enemies. I've always liked the atmosphere of these areas, but in Resident Evil 4 they are especially wonderful. Often these safe spaces appear outdoors after the player has been trudging through some claustrophobic indoor location, and the experience can really feel like a breath of fresh air. This tension-and-release dynamic also makes the game really satisfying to play, because the player feels like they've earned each moment of peace and safety.\n\nThe combat mechanics in Resident Evil 4 took some flak when the game first launched in 2005 because Leon can move and attack, but he can't do both at the same time. Of course, anyone who understands the need for tension-building in horror will recognize the ignorance of those complaints. One of the big reasons RE4's combat is so compelling is because of Leon's mobility handicap; it feels really stressful to be anchored in place while a horde of enemies creeps ever closer, and it feels really rewarding to survive a hairy encounter by skillfully knowing when to move and when to shoot.\n\nAs I said before, RE4's story is pretty terrible. Still, the game has excellent pacing which is set by the level design and enemy frequency. Unlike earlier Resident Evil games, there's not a lot of area recursion in RE4, so the game feels like it's always progressing quickly even though it takes nearly 15-20 hours to complete.\n\nResident Evil 4's weapon upgrade system functions in tandem with a simple yet addicting in-game economy based around treasure hunting. Unique treasures are hidden throughout the game world, and players who find them can sell them and purchase new weapons and upgrades. The game economy is well-balanced, and the weapon upgrades always feel like they're popping up at just the right moments--more evidence that the game was meticulously planned out. I always like my survival horror games to be on the difficult side, and from my experience, the original GameCube version of RE4 had lower values for treasure items, making the upgrades slightly harder to get and the game more difficult. The PS2 and Steam versions of the game seem comparatively easy to me, even on Professional difficulty.\n\nThere are some things I've found in this world that, despite their dark themes and focus on death, give me a surprising feeling of calm and comfort--the now defunct band "The Paper Chase"[thepaperchase.bandcamp.com] and the YouTube channel "Ask A Mortician" are examples. I also add Resident Evil 4 to this list. Yes, it is the game where my heart races as I carefully count the number of shotgun shells I've unloaded into the chainsaw-wielding monster trying to decapitate me, but it is also the game where I step out onto moonlit castle battlements, my footsteps on the cobblestone breaking through the quiet night and startling a murder of crows away from a gem-filled fountain. Resident Evil 4 is a game full of spaces and experiences to which I will always return.","April 9","true","27.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

Just two problems I'm having with the PC version. For one I can't kick open doors. Whenever I try to my foot just goes rigjht through the door, and I have to back up and then try to open it gently. As you can guess, not good if you're running from something. The second problem is some of the Villagers (At least they're the only ones that do this as far as I can tell. Just started playing the game.) They will attempt to grab the weapons that are attached at their back, but miss everytime which in turn keeps them from ever turning agro as they're constantly stuck trying to grab their weapon. I can go right up to them and knife them and still no response. Another thing. The knife. It seems like this is a bit broken as well, as when I'm knifing an enemy, it misses, even if it's slashing right at the enemy. Still, I'm unsure if I'm the only one who has this problem or not, as I can't find anything on this. Despite all of this, it's an excellent game and I would recommend this, but given these problems (Which can be severely annoying) I'd recommend getting it on console. That is unless you can find a solution. If you have this problem, and have managed to fix it, I ask if you'd please contact me with the solution as I want to like this game, but as of now, I am unable to.","May 31","false","23.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","1"

And don't get me started on 6 or Racoon City, cause Racoon city was just terrible, and 6 was a little better but still awful.\n\nAmmo and health: When I started this I got a HUGE ammount of ammo and health, and I thought "Man I wonder if I should have put this on a harder difficulty..." Then later I barely had any ammo left and a crapton of healing items, seriously RE4 you could be a LITTLE more forgiving, yes I know the enemies drop stuff but it's mainly money, give me some damn ammo or something.\n\nBosses: Some of the bosses are a total challenge to fight and some are just really simple, like the lake monster you fight all you have to do is avoid him running you into trees and just start throwing spears at him the whole time, don't even have to waste ammo.\n\nThe "Merchant": I still don't know why this guy is here, or why i'm buying/selling stuff from/to him, but atleast he's not a a$$hole or anything, but DONT KILL HIM, or you won't be able to buy/sell anything ever again for the whole game, but the one thing I REALLY hate is that he doesn't sell ammo or grenades, WHY?! When I go to his big shops I can SEE ammo and such in the back behind him, what, is he hoarding it or something?\n\nBlock doors/windows: In certain areas like the town you can block the doors or windows with bookshelves and dressers that are nearby, it's nice to barricade a part of the room, atleast for a bit till they end up breaking it down, that way you don't have to worry as much.\n\nCONS:\n\nMouse aiming: The aiming with the mouse is a little weird, but it's not bad, it's a little slow behind you're actual movement but i'm sure if they would have made it like a actual aiming mouse it would have made the game WAY too easy, so i'm glad they didn't change it.\n\nAmmo: Ammo ends up being VERY scarce later on in the game, I recommend trying to keep ammo of a certain type on you at all times and using other guns instead, I made the mistake of wasting some on downed enemies when I should have knifed them.\n\nKnife: Yes it is useful for breaking barrels and crates but I never really used this thing other than that, I did start using it later when I was low on ammo, I would shotgun the guys down, run over there, and just start knifing them, actually did more than what I thought it would, I wish they would have made the knife abit more obvious or maybe something that got peoples attention, cause I rarely use it.\n\nDogs: THESE mother f#$kers are the most annoying enemy out there, if they jump on you they can take a good 1/4 or 1/2 of your health away in just one pounce, REALLY?! I like challenge but when a enemy is heavily overpowered it gets really tedious to fight them.\n\nSome bosses: Some bosses are a total D$#k half the time, later you have to fight these 2 giants in a boiler looking room, you can make one fall into the lava to die so you will only have one left, the problem? If you get too close to the edge of the one that fell in the f#$ker grabs you and pulls you in with him, one time I was in there and made the guy fall in, then I went around the edge, he popped OUT OF THE LAVA and pulled me in, seriously?  Hell a button pressing sequence would have been PERFECT there.\n\nNo subtitles: There is a option but it's not accessible, which is really annoying, there may or may not be a fix for this, it's just a little thing I hate, I like to read what they are going to say most of the time.\n\nThe god damned Rail sequence: At one point you go into a tomb and have to ride a railcar to get to the other end where this key is at, now enemies can drop into the carts with you, but you can shoot them off before you get to them and make them fall, but it's a total b#$ch to hit them, and even the quick time sequence at the end killed me about 5 times, I am glad I don't have to deal with that again.\n\nWHAT I THINK: I think that CAPCOM had actually done something good apart from the other hideous Resident Evil games that have been made, i'm looking at you 5 and 6, and you too racoon city.  I am really glad they brought this to PC, because I loved this game so much back in the day and I still love it to this very day, it's one of the actual good games that is still entertaining.\n\nOut of all it gets a good 8/10, there are some things that still annoy me but once you get past them atleast you don't have to worry about it again, unless you decide to do another playthrough.\n\nIs this worth it on it's current price? YES. On a sale? YES.","March 16, 2014","true","27.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BisonZabi/recommended/254700/","BisonZabi","Bison 'Baby Veggies' Zabi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BisonZabi/","353 products in account","So where to start. The game is Resident Evil 4. It's now a decade old. It's the game that took a drastic shift in gameplay from its original fixed camera survival horror predecessors, and to many it was a revolutionary step for the Third Person Shooter genre.  It’s an incredible game in itself and I enjoy it so much more than many of the games today, but arguably some of the mechanics have aged over time. It’s also where all the problems began leading up to its less popular sequels.\n\nResident Evil 4, while having an eerie horror like atmosphere, is by no means ‘scary’. Previous installments left you very vulnerable (a common trait in Survival Horrors) with scarce ammunition and weaponry. Resident Evil 4 isn’t really a Survival Horror so to speak, it’s more like an action adventure game with a horror setting. And that only counts for 2/3rds of the game until it diverts from that atmosphere. After that once you get to the island, it turns into an action game. Leon is practically armed to the teeth as a one man army by the time he reaches Salazar’s castle and ammo is so plentiful that you have to be a complete dunce to run out of it. Enemies are a lot more common and come in hordes for you to slaughter with ease unlike the traditional survival horror games that have spread out opponents who engulf the atmosphere since you have to conserve your ammo. So there basically isn't any tension outside of the damsel in distress needing saving, but that’s easily negated by placing her in a corner far away. I never actually had to heal Ashley whatsoever.\n\nNevertheless, it’s the last real RE that has an actual horror setting. By the time the series came to RE5, it lost that horror element in so many ways. It’s definitely a must buy, but I suggest also buying the original Resident Evil if you wish to compare and contrast the differences between the two, as RE4 definitely changed the formula for better or worse.\n\nCrapcom has a tendency to make sloppy ports so a couple of issues I need to address:\n\nThe game, for some unknown reason, takes up more space than Resident Evil 5. Not a big deal in this day and age since it's only 10gb, but it's still nevertheless strange.\n\nThe game can start dropping rapidly in FPS during various moments. I have no clue why, but it will start hiccupping if there is flames or other things going on.\n\nUse a console controller or something else than a keyboard. Capcom never bothered to concentrate on making a smooth transition to Keyboard and Mouse so it comes off a little wonky when aiming.\n\nChange your video settings to 30FPS when you get to the god damn mine cart. There’s no save point in the second Mine Shaft and the part where Leon is attempting to lift himself up is impossible to do on 60fps no matter how many times you smash the button during the quick time event. Capcom has never bothered to address this issue.\n\nThe Separate Ways campaign that is unlocked once the game is completed was originally made for the PS2. All the ingame cutscenes in the campaign look like complete ♥♥♥♥ because it's ripped directly from the PS2.","November 11, 2015","true","58.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","4","6","2","0"

I was really excited about this port and the game is as fantastic as it was back then. But we all played RE4 so I don't want to talk about the game itself, but about the technicial aspect of it.\n\nAs promised you're getting a RE4 HD experience like never before. 60fps really gives the game a new feel but unfortunately there are some issues with that as well. The game's engine wasn't designed to run at 60fps so there are some bugs. But overall doens't hurt the experience.\n\nThe so called "HD textures" are a complete joke and aren't much of an upgrade from the original. Luckily there's a fan made high res texture pack on its way that looks beyond promising and it might be worth buying just for that.\n\nOn top of that this game is poorly optimized, so if you have a low end computer, be warned, it's much more demanding than the original PC port and you might not be able to run this.\n\nAll this aside, it's still a great game and I do recommend it.","August 18, 2015","true","77.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

RE4 is the turning point of the franchise. Capcom decided to change the way you play the game simply because REmake and Zero didn't sell well (GameCube). For the first time Resident Evil was fully 3D with behind the shoulder camera. Many people loved it and called it the best RE ever made, many people hated it and said that it's the reason behind the downfall of RE series, others liked both old and new. Will you like it? That's for you to decide.\n\nJust like in my other REviews I'll make a list of pros and cons. This time obviously I'll compare it to both oldschool and newschool REs. So, here's a list of alphabetical pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n-Camera. It's been finally patched and now you can choose between classic and centered camera. Whatever you like the most, that is.\n-Characters. RE4 features characters we already like (especially Wesker, heheh) and introduces bunch of new cool ones.\n-DLCs. RE4UHD features all available extra content there is for free! Separate Ways, Assignment Ada, Mercenaries. No need to buy them.\n-Enemies. New undiscovered enemies add extra scare factor.\n-Graphics. The game now runs in 1080p @ 60fps. there are some extra effects such as motion blur, post processing. The game's main story features real time rendered cutscenes.\n-Melee. Now you have a knife that doesn't take inventory space. Also now you can do special moves (basically coup de grâce but they're not always lethal).\n-Mercenaries. RE is well known for it's mercenaries mode in which with the given time limit you kill as many enemies as possible. It's a really fun mode and everyone should try it.\n-Mods. You can expect to see model, texture and even ambient effects mods!\n-Puzzles. Just like in old times there are few puzzles mixed in.\n-Replay value. The game has a decent replay value, especially with extra items you can earn, plus it allows you save all your end game's equipment and transfer it to a new game (obviously within borders of one difficulty).\n-Single player. ~70% of the time you're alone which is (of course) better (and more scary) than being with someone.\n-Soundtrack. The game features a good soundtrack.\n-Survival Horror. Still somewhat scary.\n-Upgrades. You can upgrade your weapons! A really satisfying (but less realistic) feature. And as an extra you can attach thing to your weapons (stock, scope).\n-Variety of weapons. Knife, handguns, shotguns, rifles. magnums, TMP, bowgun, RPG, mine thrower and other bonus weapons!\n-Weather. Unlike in previous installments which had almost static weather (always night) RE4's weather changes with the areas/chapters.\n\nCons:\n-Characters. There are few characters people would like to forget about. Mainly Salazar and Ashley.\n-Controls. Might be one of the biggest problems here. I'm not saying that the controls are bad. They're were OK when the game was released and still can be mastered. However, the horror that is crafted by the expense of the controls is a matter of discussion. You can't dodge or counter, the controls are tanky, but now there's finally a native mouse support.\n-Enemies. There are no beloved zombies. Only parasite (Las Plagas) controlled humans and other species.\n-Escort. ~30% of the time you have to escort a person with you. Sometimes you can hide him, sometimes there's no other way but to fight with him. It's possible to accidentally kill this person (enemies can kill too, y'know) which will result in "Mission Failed" screen.\n-Graphics (and Performance). RE4UHD allows you to play at anti-aliased 1080p, 60fps. That's pretty much it as the "HD" textures are ...erm... "Capcom HD" as in barely HD at all. There's a big inconsistency going on when there are extremely old blurry together with higher res new ones. Also one more thing should be mentioned. Some textures look more cleaner than the old ones aka less scary.\n-QTEs. The QTEs here are unforgiving. They give you somewhere around 1.5 seconds to react and some of them require great button mashing skills.\n-Story. Barely any.\n\nI can't remember everything, so excuse me if I forgot something.\nI tried to make the pros and cons list bias-free, but it seems like I did not satisfy the fanboys.\nFinal verdict: it's a love/hate relationship. So play the game and see it for yourself.","March 9, 2014","true","47.8"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","0"

Don't even get me started on the supposed requirements to run the game in it's HD resolution. Laptop users need not apply. The game is simply NOT optimized for PC yet, and clearly was designed a console game anyway.\n\n\nThough I understand that the game may run better on other hardware then on my PC, it would seem that many other users on the Steam community are experiencing similar problems. Even top of the line CPU's and graphics cards seem to struggle with this game. It's poorly optimized and very demanding, having supposedly been developed with the Crysis 3 engine.\n\n\nShould Capcom release a patch and fix it up, I might be able to recommend it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/synthsequence/recommended/254700/","synthsequence","synthsequence","http://steamcommunity.com/id/synthsequence/","442 products in account","(Quick verdict at the bottom)\nScore: 4/5\n\nResident Evil 4 is actually the fifth game in the main series, and definitely the most popular. Critics and gamers alike heap praise on this title like there's no tomorrow, and you can't blame them, because the game really is incredible. And although it's set some questionable trends, like the hideous and cheap quick-time event, or the genre shift from horror to action that it's successors unjustly receive criticism for, the game holds up incredibly well today. Thus it should be no surprise that it has been released on basically every platform in one way or another; this one is the second PC version. We're talking about Capcom here, people! The master milkers! This review will be mostly a comparison between the original (abysmal) 2007 PC port and this re-release.\n\nGraphically, this game isn't a remake but an HD overhaul, so don't expect it to be amazing. The new textures look great in comparison to the old ones, but still kind of washed out and muddy. Animations are exactly the same, but no complaint there, as they're extremely fluid and, well, kick-♥♥♥. There's a new lighting engine and it looks good, but still not great. Far better than the original 2007 release though. There's also a variety of video options to tweak, which, while standard, weren't there for the original, so it's a nice addition. 60fps looks great if your PC can handle it, but the option to stay at 30fps is still there for lower-end machines. I've heard complaints about how the game runs, but I haven't run into anything major so far, so I assume they've patched a couple of things. Monster design is unique and some of the best in the series, for sure. Regeneradors/Iron Maidens still scare the ♥♥♥♥ out of me, and they look even worse now in HD. Menus are crisp and finally the cutscenes are in real-time, which is so much better than those eyesore FMVs in the 2007 version.\n\nSound-wise, it holds up well. Being the middle point for the series, the voice acting sort of follows suit; it's like halfway between a B-movie (from Resident Evil 1, 2, 3 and Code: Veronica) and a Hollywood blockbuster (Resident Evil 5, Revelations and 6). Still camp, but in a good way. Music is phenomenal, very appropriate and moody depending on your circumstance in the game. Enemies sound chilling (again, the Regeneradors scare the ♥♥♥♥ out of me) and just damn cool a lot of the time. The bosses especially provide some traditional Resident Evil-style mutations. I do have an issue here though; every now and then the game will just stop playing all sounds, only for them to all play at once after a couple of seconds. It doesn't happen often but it is kind of annoying nonetheless.\n\nStory: typical Resident Evil. As in, it's just all over the place and weird. Kind of a mixed bag. One thing I never liked about the plot in Resident Evil 4 is how radically different it is from its predecessors. If you ignore the fact that Wesker, Ada and references to Umbrella's downfall are in the game, it really doesn't have anything to do with previous entries. It's pretty much entirely self-sufficient. The fact that the gameplay changes radically as well further alienates it from the earlier games. But the story has never really been a drawing point for me in this series, and it's not too complicated and gets the job done, despite some cliches here and there. Leon S. Kennedy, from Resident Evil 2, is tasked with rescuing the President's daughter, who's been kidnapped in rural Spain. He interacts with a cast of mostly interesting characters, there's a couple of plot twists, and there's some nice political stuff thrown in.\n\nThe gameplay is where this game shines, and it's easy to see why it's renowned as a classic and one of the best games of all time. Gone are the fixed camera angles, pre-rendered backgrounds, solving puzzles, zombies, and avoiding enemies. Resident Evil 4 is pure action, but this isn't a bad thing, because it's done so well. Setting the trend for basically all future third-person shooters, Resident Evil 4 is played in an over-the-shoulder view from Leon's perspective. Tank controls are far less restricting when the camera moves with you, and aiming is now free, allowing for precision, which you'll definitely need. Enemies react incredibly well depending on where you shoot them, or what type they are. No, you can't move and shoot, but you get used to it quickly (especially if you've played the earlier games).\n\nIn the place of zombies are Ganados (Spanish for "cattle"), humans who have been injected with a parasite which makes them all hive-minded servants, hell-bent on slicing you open with a scythe, or rake, or hatchet, or kitchen knife, or chainsaw. Shoot them in the arm and they'll drop their weapon. Shoot them in the leg and they'll drop to their knees, allowing you to perform a crowd-clearing and oh-so-satisfying kick to the head. They're relentless, smart and they greatly outnumber you, and they're always getting stronger and more intelligent, which keeps them from being boring and keeps you on your toes. Their human qualities and behavior makes them all the more creepy too. And there's far more than just Ganados, too. There's tons of different enemies to kill, all requiring different tactics and weapons.\n\nWeapons are now acquired (mostly) from a travelling Merchant, who is simply the greatest Resident Evil character of all time. Not really, but he's cool. You can also upgrade weapons, find and sell treasures for more money. Your inventory is now an attache case with a grid-based spacing system, meaning items such as herbs take up a mere two slots, whereas rocket launchers take up a huge a mount of space. You can rotate items to allow for more space, or throw stuff away. Pretty much everything is upgradeable, and the sense of progression is really, really satisfying.\n\nResident Evil 4 is also perhaps the only game in existence to have an escort mission that is actually ENJOYABLE. For about half of the game you have to escort Ashley Graham, the President's daughter, to safety. If she dies or gets captured, Game Over. Thankfully, her AI is actually pretty good, and the fact that you can tell her to stop and hide rather than having to constantly be on the lookout makes the game much less of a hassle.\n\nIt controls well, although they definitely haven't aged as well as everything else. This port allows for much greater compatibility, either with a 360 controller or keyboard and mouse. Nothing astounding, but when you consider that the original 2007 release miraculously didn't have mouse support, it's a nice touch. And there's a slew of extras after completing the game. Tons of content to unlock, to keep you going. Sure, there isn't anything new in this version that you haven't seen since the original came out, but at least it's all there!\n\nIf there's one bad thing I can say about this release, it's the fact that it's basically a giant middle-finger to the awesome modding community of the original 2007 version. The people here: http://z6.invisionfree.com/Resident_Evil_4_PC/index.php?showforum=10 made what was one of the worst ports in history into one of the best through their hard work and dedication. I'm assuming Capcom either saw what they transformed this game into, or given that it's easier to port nowadays and that there's already a PS3/360 HD version available, decided that they'd just re-release it for some quick cash. However, there is a new modding community for the HD re-release, and if it picks up even a quarter as much as the original community, I'll be really impressed. After all, I did support Capcom and their money-grubbing ways by buying it again.\n\nVerdict: Buy it if you haven't played it before or in a long time. It's definitely the best version. Otherwise, stick with whatever release you currently have. There's nothing new here. But that ain't a bad thing!","June 24, 2014","true","43.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrismaticDemi/recommended/254700/","PrismaticDemi","Prismatic Demi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrismaticDemi/","49 products in account","I bought this game for GameCube back when it first came out. I've also owned it on PS2 and now through Steam on PC. All-in-all, I can tell you that this is a very good game - the fact that I've bought it 3 times should tell you something. This is by far my favorite of the Resident Evil series games, after playing all of them, minus Code Veronica. The story is very well thought through and to back it up, it takes a solid 12-15 hours of gameplay for a seasoned player that knows all of the tricks in the game. There are 3 main areas in the game, starting in a Village, progressing to a Castle, then onto an Island. (Each takes several hours to complete.) This has always been among my favorite games ever since i first played it 7+ years ago, which is why i was thrilled as hell to see it remastered and put onto a PC version. Controls are easy to configure/get used to wrether you're using a controller or the keyboard/mouse. If you're not new to this game, but worried that the remastering of this game changed it too much - don't be. There have been zero glitches so far for me and the graphics didn't really change that much tbh, other than removing some pixel blur here and there, which adds up for a better visual experience. It's just as I always remembered it when I was a little kid that dumped his birthday money on this game for the GameCube. Overall, I would gladly go out of my way to recommend this game. It has great replay value, due to higher difficulties, game-modes, and bonus weapons/costumes unlocked through beating it in each difficulty. A solid 9/10 from me overall - even in today's standards. Well worth every penny, and long enough to justify $20. To be honest, I'm surprised that Steam didn't charge more due to it's remastered version.","July 20, 2014","true","68.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/synthsequence/recommended/254700/","synthsequence","synthsequence","http://steamcommunity.com/id/synthsequence/","442 products in account","(Quick verdict at the bottom)\nScore: 4/5\n\nResident Evil 4 is actually the fifth game in the main series, and definitely the most popular. Critics and gamers alike heap praise on this title like there's no tomorrow, and you can't blame them, because the game really is incredible. And although it's set some questionable trends, like the hideous and cheap quick-time event, or the genre shift from horror to action that it's successors unjustly receive criticism for, the game holds up incredibly well today. Thus it should be no surprise that it has been released on basically every platform in one way or another; this one is the second PC version. We're talking about Capcom here, people! The master milkers! This review will be mostly a comparison between the original (abysmal) 2007 PC port and this re-release.\n\nGraphically, this game isn't a remake but an HD overhaul, so don't expect it to be amazing. The new textures look great in comparison to the old ones, but still kind of washed out and muddy. Animations are exactly the same, but no complaint there, as they're extremely fluid and, well, kick-♥♥♥. There's a new lighting engine and it looks good, but still not great. Far better than the original 2007 release though. There's also a variety of video options to tweak, which, while standard, weren't there for the original, so it's a nice addition. 60fps looks great if your PC can handle it, but the option to stay at 30fps is still there for lower-end machines. I've heard complaints about how the game runs, but I haven't run into anything major so far, so I assume they've patched a couple of things. Monster design is unique and some of the best in the series, for sure. Regeneradors/Iron Maidens still scare the ♥♥♥♥ out of me, and they look even worse now in HD. Menus are crisp and finally the cutscenes are in real-time, which is so much better than those eyesore FMVs in the 2007 version.\n\nSound-wise, it holds up well. Being the middle point for the series, the voice acting sort of follows suit; it's like halfway between a B-movie (from Resident Evil 1, 2, 3 and Code: Veronica) and a Hollywood blockbuster (Resident Evil 5, Revelations and 6). Still camp, but in a good way. Music is phenomenal, very appropriate and moody depending on your circumstance in the game. Enemies sound chilling (again, the Regeneradors scare the ♥♥♥♥ out of me) and just damn cool a lot of the time. The bosses especially provide some traditional Resident Evil-style mutations. I do have an issue here though; every now and then the game will just stop playing all sounds, only for them to all play at once after a couple of seconds. It doesn't happen often but it is kind of annoying nonetheless.\n\nStory: typical Resident Evil. As in, it's just all over the place and weird. Kind of a mixed bag. One thing I never liked about the plot in Resident Evil 4 is how radically different it is from its predecessors. If you ignore the fact that Wesker, Ada and references to Umbrella's downfall are in the game, it really doesn't have anything to do with previous entries. It's pretty much entirely self-sufficient. The fact that the gameplay changes radically as well further alienates it from the earlier games. But the story has never really been a drawing point for me in this series, and it's not too complicated and gets the job done, despite some cliches here and there. Leon S. Kennedy, from Resident Evil 2, is tasked with rescuing the President's daughter, who's been kidnapped in rural Spain. He interacts with a cast of mostly interesting characters, there's a couple of plot twists, and there's some nice political stuff thrown in.\n\nThe gameplay is where this game shines, and it's easy to see why it's renowned as a classic and one of the best games of all time. Gone are the fixed camera angles, pre-rendered backgrounds, solving puzzles, zombies, and avoiding enemies. Resident Evil 4 is pure action, but this isn't a bad thing, because it's done so well. Setting the trend for basically all future third-person shooters, Resident Evil 4 is played in an over-the-shoulder view from Leon's perspective. Tank controls are far less restricting when the camera moves with you, and aiming is now free, allowing for precision, which you'll definitely need. Enemies react incredibly well depending on where you shoot them, or what type they are. No, you can't move and shoot, but you get used to it quickly (especially if you've played the earlier games).\n\nIn the place of zombies are Ganados (Spanish for "cattle"), humans who have been injected with a parasite which makes them all hive-minded servants, hell-bent on slicing you open with a scythe, or rake, or hatchet, or kitchen knife, or chainsaw. Shoot them in the arm and they'll drop their weapon. Shoot them in the leg and they'll drop to their knees, allowing you to perform a crowd-clearing and oh-so-satisfying kick to the head. They're relentless, smart and they greatly outnumber you, and they're always getting stronger and more intelligent, which keeps them from being boring and keeps you on your toes. Their human qualities and behavior makes them all the more creepy too. And there's far more than just Ganados, too. There's tons of different enemies to kill, all requiring different tactics and weapons.\n\nWeapons are now acquired (mostly) from a travelling Merchant, who is simply the greatest Resident Evil character of all time. Not really, but he's cool. You can also upgrade weapons, find and sell treasures for more money. Your inventory is now an attache case with a grid-based spacing system, meaning items such as herbs take up a mere two slots, whereas rocket launchers take up a huge a mount of space. You can rotate items to allow for more space, or throw stuff away. Pretty much everything is upgradeable, and the sense of progression is really, really satisfying.\n\nResident Evil 4 is also perhaps the only game in existence to have an escort mission that is actually ENJOYABLE. For about half of the game you have to escort Ashley Graham, the President's daughter, to safety. If she dies or gets captured, Game Over. Thankfully, her AI is actually pretty good, and the fact that you can tell her to stop and hide rather than having to constantly be on the lookout makes the game much less of a hassle.\n\nIt controls well, although they definitely haven't aged as well as everything else. This port allows for much greater compatibility, either with a 360 controller or keyboard and mouse. Nothing astounding, but when you consider that the original 2007 release miraculously didn't have mouse support, it's a nice touch. And there's a slew of extras after completing the game. Tons of content to unlock, to keep you going. Sure, there isn't anything new in this version that you haven't seen since the original came out, but at least it's all there!\n\nIf there's one bad thing I can say about this release, it's the fact that it's basically a giant middle-finger to the awesome modding community of the original 2007 version. The people here: http://z6.invisionfree.com/Resident_Evil_4_PC/index.php?showforum=10 made what was one of the worst ports in history into one of the best through their hard work and dedication. I'm assuming Capcom either saw what they transformed this game into, or given that it's easier to port nowadays and that there's already a PS3/360 HD version available, decided that they'd just re-release it for some quick cash. However, there is a new modding community for the HD re-release, and if it picks up even a quarter as much as the original community, I'll be really impressed. After all, I did support Capcom and their money-grubbing ways by buying it again.\n\nVerdict: Buy it if you haven't played it before or in a long time. It's definitely the best version. Otherwise, stick with whatever release you currently have. There's nothing new here. But that ain't a bad thing!","June 24, 2014","true","43.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The graphics look pretty good and the lighting is much improved over the vanilla 2007 version. The HD textures of the unmodded game however cannot match the image quality of the modded HD textures of the 2007 version. So the most signifcant improvement is the 60fps (if your PC can handle it though)\n\nM&K controls are awesome once you get used to them, and if you don't mind to adjust them manually till you find your best settings. The Mouse control  is very responsive and the aiming is very smooth. Those who suffer from Mouse responsiveness issues I suggest them to adjust the sensitivety as the default setting is very slow.\n\nOne of the downsides of this version is that it requires a hefty CPU to run at 60fps -(you need at least a CPU that is based on Nehalem architecture from Intel (First gen Core i5s/ i7s) or a K10 CPU from AMD (Phenom IIs)  to have 60 fps)-. However it is not hard on any high-end or mid-range graphics card that has released 5 years ago or later.\nI played the game on 3 cards and all of them managed to get constant 60fps at 1920x1080 8x MSAA and all settings on High : GTX 470, HD 7950 and GTX 780 Ti.\n\nI highly recommend this game, I give it a 9/10.","March 13, 2015","true","59.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Leon's jacket seems hardly different. I've seen much better, higher res textures developed independently and available for free download (the Epsilon/Darkplaces mod for Quake 1 comes to mind).\n\nAlso, they bound actions to X rather than A, without enough customization to swap the two. This left me with a rather confused thumb, since even newer console games have you pressing A to pick things up. And though I am proficient in games with WASD controls, keyboard and mouse are not an option for a game like this, regardless of customization. They should have let you set individual buttons for both keyboard and controller. It's nothing I can't get used to, but it's still very inconvenient.\n\nIf you're new to RE4, then you probably might have a better relationship to the controls. But if you're a veteran, beware of missed button presses.\n\nThough it is indeed a HUGE step up from the initial PC release from 2005, it's still very lacking for a "remastered" game. They could have done so much better like they did with the more recent RE1 remaster.\n\nI almost want to say it isn't worth the 20 bucks I spent on it. This game is a classic and deserves better. But as a fan, I still think people should buy it because it's full of action and awesome gameplay (with the exception of escorting Ashley, the annoying little twerp).","March 19, 2015","true","1.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'll just make some comments on the UHD version for Steam, in case your thinking to buy it:\n\n\n1 - HD Textures\n\nThe Village textures looks pretty much HD, but we can´t say the same for the rest of the game.\n\nSome "Casstle" textures (just a few) and a lot of textures from "The Island" chapter, look like the SD versions. Besides, weapon's textures are pretty awfull (that's what bothers me most :P).\n\n\n2 - 60 Fps\n\nSome animations (like rifle and bowgun reloads) were not ported to 60fps. Also some animations like ganado's exploding heads, etc.\n\nSometimes, 60 fps brake the game (it's VERY RARE tough). Sometimes it makes enemies run in circles and stuff like that.\n\nFalling objects drop at double speed (U3's cages, spinels, etc). This is a minor detail, but it's not very neat.\n\nBesides all the "downsides", playing the game in 60 fps is awesome. And a Feature of this version only.\n\n\n3 - Mouse & Keyboard support.\n\nAfter 6 game patches, controls work great.\n\n\n4 - Vissual FX\n\nNothing to critisize in this aspect. Altough the GC version is still superior (DOF, multiple screen filters, etc), the UHD port is VERY decent (everything important was included).\n\n\n5 - Real Time cutscenes\n\nCutscenes are real-time, except the ones of "Separate Ways" mode and "ESPECIAL 2" custome in the main campaing (since this costume wasn't included in the GC version of the game).\n\n\n6 - System requirements\n\nThey are quite HIGH for a 10 year old game. I own a Phenom II X4 955 with a HD Radeon 6870, and I have to disable AA in order to run the game at 60 fps and 1080p.\n\nAlso played it at 60 fps 800x600 on a Nvidia 8600GT videocard.\n\n\nConclusion?\n\nVery good port (FAR better than the 2007 one) but it still needs polish. Not better than the GC, but pretty close, with the addition of HD textures (65% of them), 60 fps, and of course: the K&M support (this alone makes it worth for any PC user)\n\nThe game is super FUN.\n\nHope my review will be usefull to you.\n\nRegards.","May 29, 2014","true","131.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The controls are like a tank (old school) and the graphics still have a 2005 vibe to them but much much cleaner than before.

The textures are improved for sure, and the gameplay is at 60 FPS which is amazing, BUT because of the age of the game there is only so much that Capcom can do without re-making Resident Evil 4. As for those that claim the game is a bad port because of crappy mouse + keyboard controls, they are just idiots that never played RE4 on the Gamecube or PS2. This game was designed with "tank controls" in mind, meaning that the camera DOES NOT CONTROL Leon's movement in any way. You do not use the mouse to turn Leon while holding down W to move forward. This is how the original game was designed, and for PC gamers this may take some time to get use to it, since we intuitively use our mouse to turn our characters ingame. The mouse is just used for aiming while in "aim mode". All-in-all this is a great port, and I highly recommend this game for all Resident Evil franchise lovers, or anyone in general that enjoys this genre.","March 8, 2014","true","33.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I can't say much about it that hasn't already been said. It's fun, visceral action that lets you have your murderparty, but makes ammo and health just scarce enough to make each murderparty feel like it had an actual cost. It introduced the world to quicktime events (for better and for worse), blew our minds with its diverse cast of monsters to mow down, and gave us weapons-grade B-movie dialogue to make endless fun of. I'm almost certain I've finished the game more than fifteen times over, but somehow, I still have just as much fun now as I did my first time through, and that's an accomplishment.

Textures have been improved a bit, looking almost as good as L4D2's, The keyboard and mouse controls come 2nd best to the Wii version. If you've beaten RE4 a long time ago and want to revisit it, THIS is the one to play. If you're new to it, don't judge it harshly. The controls are like a tank (old school) and the graphics still have a 2005 vibe to them but much much cleaner than before. If you haven't played any RE game before, this one is good to start with as it doesn't have zombies from earlier in the series, instead has a different plague. As of now, the game needs patch for some small issues, and a big one that's not in the main story mode. That shouldn't stop you from buying it. It's an excellent survival horror/action. Something I should note, the game's speed is tied to the frames-per-second (like an emulator). There are 2 FPS settings: 30 and 60. If you can't keep a steady 60, try 30. If you can't keep a steady 30, give up. lol.","March 4, 2014","true","71.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MarkfromTheRoom/recommended/254700/","MarkfromTheRoom","MarkfromTheRoom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MarkfromTheRoom/","307 products in account","Resident Evil 4 is one of the greatest games ever made.  It rejuvenated the series as it was slowly becoming stagnant.  RE4 didn't kill the series because it was bad but rather because it was so good any further sequel would be worse no matter what.  It's a flawless mix of survival, horror, action, a pinch of puzzle solving and a huge amount of camp.  I love that this game doesn't take itself seriously like 99% of games these days.  RE4 practically invented the set piece action sequences seen in most modern games but it also features plenty of "meat n' potatoes" gameplay in between the set pieces.  The environments are incredibly varied and it's simply a blast from beginning to end.  Perhaps controversial are the QTE's.  While I don't particularly enjoy QTE's I can appreciate their usage in RE4 for heightening tension and not going overboard with them as some games do.  I could go on and on, but these are all points shared across all versions of the game.  The most important thing this PC re-release provides is mostly functional 60fps support.  Playing this at 60fps is a revelation; there is absolutely no going back.  It's so much easier on the eyes and plays much better.  Aiming is smoother, even with a controller.  I've been gaming on a 120hz monitor for a few years now and even though the game is capped at 60fps it feels smoother than most games do at 60fps.  I think because the animations are keyed to the framerate is why it appears this way.  For example, Wolfenstein: TNO feels downright choppy at 60fps whereas this is absolutely butter smooth.  Mouse and keyboard support is present but not quite as good as I'd hoped for.  The mouse is a tad wonky even with the "modern" aim setting.  It feels like there is a slight amount of dampening but at least it seems as though the negative acceleration is gone.  It supports key rebinding but the defaults were just fine IMO.  Overall, M+KB is definitely usable but not necessarily ideal.  For a game like this, it really was intended to be played with a controller and it plays very well with a 360 pad.  If you're a huge fan of RE4 like myself, you need this version for the 60fps alone.  Sure it has some minor bugs and glitches but it's still by far the very best vanilla version of RE4 available and it'll only get better with further modding.  I wish this had had a higher budget internally at Capcom.  I'd gladly have paid a full $60 for a flawless re-release of RE4 with a more moderate graphical overhaul, perfect M+KB controls, no bugs or quirks, etc.  RE4 really deserves better than these budget re-releases Capcom's been doing, but overall it's hard to complain.  This release feels 90% finished for $20 which is still much, much, much better than the craptastic Sourcenext original PC release.","June 20, 2014","true","88.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's the classic, with some revamped textures. Now, before I continue, let me warn you that I'm about to dump a lot on this release... not to say that I don't like it, nor that I don't recommend it (quite the contrary, if you haven't picked it up on steam yet, do so!), but Capcom's had quite a while to work on this release and yet they've only come up with something that's slightly better than what modders had already achieved on the first PC Port.\n\nFirst things first: control scheme. This game was designed to be played with a controller, and it can only really be appreciated by being played on a controller. The keyboard+mouse support is no better than the old PC Port with the fan-made mouse support mod.\n\nSecond: the textures aren't that great. Basically, it's just a more polished official version (but nothing that the fan-made mods didn't do for the original PC port).\n\nThird: what really sets it apart is the dynamic lighting (really gives a more realistic feel, since the night is darker and the torches/lamps really contribute to the lighting). But other than that, it offers very little improvement in regards to visuals. It sports 3 post-processing effects which are nothing more than glorified color filters... And it also "sports" full 60 frames per second capabilities, which happen to be very dependent on rig specs (and this doesn't mean that by having the latest graphics card you'll pull it off without problems, since the engine is very finnicky and only plays well with certain setups), and the game engine isn't really prepared to run at 60 frames per second (some animations, like falling debris after an explosion, play out rapidly... like twice as fast... coincidentally, the game was designed to be run at 30 frames per second).\n\nFourth: one of the last weapons you obtain (after finishing pro mode) is the version present in the Wii release (multi-target). So YAY!\n\nBasically, that's all I have to say. I know it sounds a bit negative, but that's just to warn you that this isn't like the Resident Evil 1 remake at all. This is just a facelift to a game that's already dated... but a really fun and worthwhile game at that. The story is great, the pacing is nearly perfect, and all the elements come together to make it an experience you certainly won't forget. And one which you'll definitely come back to later. Personally, it's better than both RE5 and RE6... but that's just me.\n\nSo is it worth it? Heck yeah! Just don't get too caught up in the hype.\n\n\n... eh, who am I kidding?

You get a remastered version of the game plus "Seperate Ways" for only 20 bucks. You can't beat that. The games shades and textures definitely make the game feel brand new again. 60 frames keep it fast-paced and will keep you on your toes while still looking smoother than ever. Playing with a controller is a must seeing as how the keyboard and mouse controls feel too rigid. Keep post process quality off unless you want the game to run like like a one-legged dog with a vestibular disorder. If you experience any lag you may need to adjust the anisotropic filtering.

I can't say much about it that hasn't already been said. It's fun, visceral action that lets you have your murderparty, but makes ammo and health just scarce enough to make each murderparty feel like it had an actual cost. It introduced the world to quicktime events (for better and for worse), blew our minds with its diverse cast of monsters to mow down, and gave us weapons-grade B-movie dialogue to make endless fun of. I'm almost certain I've finished the game more than fifteen times over, but somehow, I still have just as much fun now as I did my first time through, and that's an accomplishment.

Kennedy, one of the greatest Zombie survivors and characters in all of Resident Evil, play him as he fights his way through another Virus called the Plagas where he will verse a Village of seriously ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of Zombies, Creatures and (Pedos) I mean Very powerful Villains who kidnap little girls Who is the President’s Daughter.\n\nGraphics:\nFrom when this was created is was my favourite and at top rank with Final Fantasy X. The graphics and scenarios as well as cinematic were outstanding, as you wonder into the abyss and unknown terrains you can admire some beautiful scenes and really appreciate the games developed as it’s taken from the previous games from 1-3. With the Characters, bosses and the way the texture was layed out I would give it top marks.\n\nGame play:\nThis game will have you on the edge of your seat and will test you reflexes to the max as you fight of Villages and guys with Potato Sacks on their head, Which when you hear the noise will get you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ your panties if you don’t know what’s to come or even if you still do. If you were a controller player then its pretty standard with the aiming and shooting and activation buttons and will take time to switch to keyboard and mouse and vice-versa.\nThis game give you tons of puzzles, characters backgrounds, random Enemies and an amazing new way of carrying items as you are given a suitcase to carry out your items and Weapons.\nThe fun doesn’t even stop there. After completing the game you have the chance to continue the story as you play with Ada Wong in her story line. And Mercenaries as where you get to play with many Characters Such as Krauser, HUNK and ALBERT ♥♥♥♥ING WESKER (THE LEGEND OF ALL VILLAINS)\n\nAdvantage:\nThis game will challenge even the best of players and as the Story-line continues on Leon S. Kennedy you will not be disappointed in any of the game, with funny Quotes, Merchants who you will love/hate.\nThere are Special Figures and bonus packs which come with the game so no add that’ll keep the game interesting and with surprises around every corner you will always be happy with this game.\n\nDisadvantage:\nThe only things I truly believe that’ll frustrate you, would be the Ai as sometimes it’s hard to try and command Ashley to do what you want in certain situations that would probably get you killed as she runs towards the danger because she found weed...I mean Herbs.\n\nOverall:\nI do believe this is my favourite Resident Evil game and has been for a very long time, with everything from the story-line, Cinematic, game play, and the way the game was structured. I would give this game my 10/10 this is including all the flaws.\nThis is Hands Down the best Resident Evil game in my Opinion and I do believe those who are Resident Evil Fan would also agree with me too.\nThank you for reading and Peace Out.","June 20, 2015","true","45.1"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

With this in mind, I've actually never played it very much at all. I jumped on the opportunity to play this game on PC in what they called the "definitive version." I was not disappointed.\n\nReturning fans will enjoy the updated graphics, though they should not expect current-gen graphics. Most of the textures are mainly just given a spit-polish; this is to compensate for current computer specs (like widescreen support and higher resolutions). The options allow you to choose between the original graphics and the new HD graphics, improved motion blur, various post-processing shaders, etc.\n\nThe gameplay, in all directions, have been left alone. Don't fix what isn't broken, right? The PC controls feel very fluid, and players that prefer using a controller will feel just fine with the Xbox controls, as well. Other controllers (like a PS3 controller being emulated through MotionInJoy) are also responsive, although the buttons are just listed as their designated numbers.\n\nYou can upgrade and buy your weapons at the merchant, play a little shooting range mini-game for some cash, and various other quirky things that make this game feel like it legitimately progresses. I didn't feel any slow moments after the beginning; they constantly threw new things at me and I loved every minute of it.\n\nNothing in the game has been streamlined; this includes the Ashley sequences. Don't get me wrong, I understand that everyone has their preferences, but I don't understand the hate behind the escort sections. They were fine to me, but that's just me, I suppose.\n\nThe level design is incredible. With an open-world dynamic to each region, players can explore to their heart's content. The game features few branching paths, but a few extra things that require various things to access, like Ashley.\n\nThe sound is updated to fit a higher quality standard. Not much worth of noting here, but potential buyers should be warned that the sound can desync from the video at times.\n\nOverall, the game gets a "must-buy" from me. For $20 USD, players get a game with an incredible amount of replay value and extra content.","March 8, 2014","true","35.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MarkfromTheRoom/recommended/254700/","MarkfromTheRoom","MarkfromTheRoom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MarkfromTheRoom/","307 products in account","Resident Evil 4 is one of the greatest games ever made.  It rejuvenated the series as it was slowly becoming stagnant.  RE4 didn't kill the series because it was bad but rather because it was so good any further sequel would be worse no matter what.  It's a flawless mix of survival, horror, action, a pinch of puzzle solving and a huge amount of camp.  I love that this game doesn't take itself seriously like 99% of games these days.  RE4 practically invented the set piece action sequences seen in most modern games but it also features plenty of "meat n' potatoes" gameplay in between the set pieces.  The environments are incredibly varied and it's simply a blast from beginning to end.  Perhaps controversial are the QTE's.  While I don't particularly enjoy QTE's I can appreciate their usage in RE4 for heightening tension and not going overboard with them as some games do.  I could go on and on, but these are all points shared across all versions of the game.  The most important thing this PC re-release provides is mostly functional 60fps support.  Playing this at 60fps is a revelation; there is absolutely no going back.  It's so much easier on the eyes and plays much better.  Aiming is smoother, even with a controller.  I've been gaming on a 120hz monitor for a few years now and even though the game is capped at 60fps it feels smoother than most games do at 60fps.  I think because the animations are keyed to the framerate is why it appears this way.  For example, Wolfenstein: TNO feels downright choppy at 60fps whereas this is absolutely butter smooth.  Mouse and keyboard support is present but not quite as good as I'd hoped for.  The mouse is a tad wonky even with the "modern" aim setting.  It feels like there is a slight amount of dampening but at least it seems as though the negative acceleration is gone.  It supports key rebinding but the defaults were just fine IMO.  Overall, M+KB is definitely usable but not necessarily ideal.  For a game like this, it really was intended to be played with a controller and it plays very well with a 360 pad.  If you're a huge fan of RE4 like myself, you need this version for the 60fps alone.  Sure it has some minor bugs and glitches but it's still by far the very best vanilla version of RE4 available and it'll only get better with further modding.  I wish this had had a higher budget internally at Capcom.  I'd gladly have paid a full $60 for a flawless re-release of RE4 with a more moderate graphical overhaul, perfect M+KB controls, no bugs or quirks, etc.  RE4 really deserves better than these budget re-releases Capcom's been doing, but overall it's hard to complain.  This release feels 90% finished for $20 which is still much, much, much better than the craptastic Sourcenext original PC release.","June 20, 2014","true","88.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've also owned it on PS2 and now through Steam on PC. All-in-all, I can tell you that this is a very good game - the fact that I've bought it 3 times should tell you something. This is by far my favorite of the Resident Evil series games, after playing all of them, minus Code Veronica. The story is very well thought through and to back it up, it takes a solid 12-15 hours of gameplay for a seasoned player that knows all of the tricks in the game. There are 3 main areas in the game, starting in a Village, progressing to a Castle, then onto an Island. (Each takes several hours to complete.) This has always been among my favorite games ever since i first played it 7+ years ago, which is why i was thrilled as hell to see it remastered and put onto a PC version. Controls are easy to configure/get used to wrether you're using a controller or the keyboard/mouse. If you're not new to this game, but worried that the remastering of this game changed it too much - don't be. There have been zero glitches so far for me and the graphics didn't really change that much tbh, other than removing some pixel blur here and there, which adds up for a better visual experience. It's just as I always remembered it when I was a little kid that dumped his birthday money on this game for the GameCube. Overall, I would gladly go out of my way to recommend this game. It has great replay value, due to higher difficulties, game-modes, and bonus weapons/costumes unlocked through beating it in each difficulty. A solid 9/10 from me overall - even in today's standards. Well worth every penny, and long enough to justify $20. To be honest, I'm surprised that Steam didn't charge more due to it's remastered version.","July 20, 2014","true","68.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This was the first Resident Evil I played, and one of my first M-rated game and I'm glad it was. Personally, and like popular opinion, this is one of the best in the franchise.\n\nThe game follows and pays homage to the older titles, while changing things up for the better. Its tank-like controls from the first 3 games is now bearable with the 3rd-person/over-shoulder camera, but adds some tension in combat. While some/large parts of the game are escort segments, Ashley's AI is relatively painless and isn't too difficult to manage(It's a breeze if you unlock a certain something). The visuals are dated after 10 years (Writing this review as of 2015) but manage to maintain the creepy silent hill-esque environment. The tension and atmoshpere of survival horror is definitely present, while keeping combat much less stiff than the previous. Progression feels good and replayability is definitely there. The weapons come in just the right amount and each feel different in their own right. The story is kinda cheesy, but with the "virus/parasites" at hand what can you expect. The extra gamemodes add a more action-y way to play while netting shiny rewards and expanding on some parts of the main story.  I don't to give anything away or spoil anything, but Resident Evil 4 is definitely worth picking up if you are already a fan of the series, played it before, or never played a Resident Evil game.\n\n\n(Also ♥♥♥♥ Regenetors, those things made me shut of the game the very first time I ecountered them)","July 18, 2015","true","31.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I then bought it for the Wii and played through that version about 3 times. I've been out of the country for awhile now and haven't had access to the GC or Wii version. Luckily, it came on Steam.\n\nAs of typing this, I have somewhere around 37 hours clocked in. I've played through the Steam version twice, once on Normal and once on Professional. I would have more hours, but I don't have access to my desktop computer and my laptop has trouble running this game. My desktop runs the game almost flawlessly, but it's about 6 years old now, so there are some issues here and there.\n\nAll that aside, I really do think this might be the best game ever made. The biggest reason this game is so great is because of the flow of the game and the level design. As you progress through the game, each area is so different than the last. This game never gets old.\n\nThere is a wide variety of weapons and upgrades which become available as you progress through the game and if you ever want a break, you have Mercenaries mode, which could almost be its own game. There are also some other extras like Assignment Ada, Separate Ways, and the gun range.\n\nFlaws some people might say this game has:\n\nNot being able to move while shooting\nThe island not being as well made as the village and the castle\n"Leon, help!!!!!!!"\nNo Luis in Merceneries mode\n\nI love this game and I can't recommend it enough.\n\nUpdate -- Going to the config.ini file and changing anisotropy to 2 (thanks whoever's review I read) and then loading the game and changing the FPS to 30 makes the game run mostly smooth on my laptop.

(cough...cough...I wouldn't headshot enemies if I'd be you cough...cough...)\n+HD is pretty good.\n+Limited inventory.\n+Soundtracks are very well written.\n+Creative in a japanese way.\n+New terrifying enemies such as the Regenarators who are nearly immortal. I don't want to spoil the others.\n+Now you have to worry about an other person, too, not just yourself...\n-...but that person sometimes just sits down waiting to get killed.....WHY?Or even she may get stuck and can't even a carry a ♥♥♥♥ing herb. I was praying to get her taken again for as long as possible.\n-For me it was a very long time to get used to the controls with a controller.\n-Bugs.But not the funny ones, when a character flyes or something like that. No, for example a boss stucks in loop leaving you unable to progress or quick time events those are impossible to do etc....\n-The story is pretty flat, seriously even 6 has a better story.\n-The audio is out of sync during cutscenes for many people.\n-1/2 of the game tries to be survival horror (and horror) and the other 1/2 of the game tries to be a good action game, but it really feels neither of them.\n\nIn overall:After all I can still recommend this game. Yes it's true that neither it's a good action game or a good survival horror, but if you're lucky it can be really fun(but I'm sure it will be fun for almost everybody who is at least a little bit interested in this game), but it's still can't be the best RE game in my opinion. If you want to play a hardcore survival horror with good graphics play RE REmaster (or the Revelations games, but they're not that hardcore). If you want to play a good action game play RE5.","June 12, 2015","true","29.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I KNOW THIS ♥♥♥♥ LIKE THE BACK OF MY HAND. I'm mainly putting some quick thoughts down for those who haven't played it or played an older version.\n\nOk, obviously the games good. Worth the cost if you haven't played it or want to go through again. It still holds up fantastically, The PC version has all the extras from the GC and PS2 editions which is a nice little plus. Keyboard and mouse controls are kinda gross, and Quicktime events can screw you over on an xbox controller because there is a glitch where it shows the keys to press instead of the controller buttons.\n\nThis is the pinnacle of the Resident Evil Series - creepy but not too scary, controls great (with a controller at least), hard but not impossible, and chock full of little secrets. A few too many QTE's but most of them aren't troubling. If for some reason you don't have a copy of this game, you need to get it. It's worth every single cent. For some reason I had a little more trouble noticing items on the PC version but that may be an issue with my monitor. I cannot find any outstanding issues with the port over to PC.\n\nThe story is great, every part is memorable and noteworthy and you can feel the meticulous planning and love that went into every detail of the game. You don't need a super strong PC to run it smoothly so unless you're running an ancient rig or still have an other version to play GET THIS VERSION AND PLAY THROUGH IT ALREADY.","December 16, 2014","true","8.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Since then it has become much, much more playable.\n\nCHANGES:\n--There exists now a "modern" mode which fixes the clunky, unresponsive mouse controls, making them much more smooth and fast.  (Also in classic, the unresponsiveness has been fixed, but the sensitivity is much lower than it would be in modern)\n--A and D are still used for actually TURNING.  This is an intended feature, however, and the game is balanced around it.  You get used to it, eventually.  You can use the mouse to free-look quite well, while not aiming.\n--The quick-turn button still isn't always responsive, but you have to hold S and then press Shift for it to recognize the input.  Q can also initiate a quick-turn.\n\nThere is still a problem with the low FoV, but it's an intended feature much like the tank control turning.\n\nThe game is now much more playable for mouse + keyboard input.  I p̶l̶a̶y̶e̶d̶ died for 6 hours straight the day before I wrote this.  Very fun.\n\n\n------------------------\nOLD, OUTDATED REVIEW WRITTEN BY SOME STUPID NERD (me):\n------------------------\n\nThe game itself is great, no one will dispute that.  However, this port, I found, isn't very friendly to M&KB:\n\n--I had to move my mouse across my desk at least 4 times to do a complete 360 (This is at maximum sensitivity)\n--You can't steer with just M&KB, you have to use just the keyboard for turning (A and D to turn left & right.. but you get used to it)\n--There is significant delay for actions sometimes.  For example, when you pull out your knife and go to swing it at someone (using the keyboard), it takes about a second for the game to recognize that you're actually moving your mouse.\n--The quick-turn button (shift + S) doesn't always recognize your inputs, so times when I wanted to turn around to start actually defending myself, I couldn't.  I couldn't, because I ended up tapping the keys about 3 times, and all Leon did was backpedal a little.\n--The mouse is vastly inferior to the controller for this game, because all too often, the game hinders the use of the mouse by slowing it down to stupid levels.  I don't know why they didn't just use the code for the mouse that they used for RE5 (for aiming, general movement, ect).\n\nI get that the game is supposed to feel "clunky," because after all, it IS a survival horror game.  SURVIVAL, combat is not supposed to be easy.  However, that doesn't mean it has to be broken for mouse input.  If you're not entirely sure what I mean by this, imagine the mouse controls for the original Dead Space on PC.  It can be that bad at times.\n\nOn top of this, while I was playing (about 25 minutes in) I started to get HORRIBLE FPS drops.  In the top right of my screen, apparently the game kept queueing up a download for the art book and soundtrack.. but.. kept downloading them over, and over, and over again, while I was playing?  I got about 5-10 FPS at this point, when before I was getting 60 without drops.  Don't get me wrong, from a technical standpoint, this game is pretty rock solid when it comes to performance.  This was the only performance hitch I got.\n\nSpecs:\ni7 2600k @ 3.4 GHz\nGTX 770 @ 4 GB\n12 GB DDR3 RAM","February 28, 2014","true","24.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","8"

You probably have already played RE4 at some point, so this is going to be a "port report". First off, the game speed is tied to the framerate and you get to pick between a 30 and 60 FPS lock. Now although this is an old game, you are probably going to need at least a Quad-core CPU and more than 3GB of RAM if you want to run it at 60 and not experience any slowdowns even with the standart textures. The game was never meant to work at 60 FPS, and this is especially obvious when it's raining and the framerate gets cut in half, but I think this is probably because I'm barely over the minimum requirements. Also, I believe that 6 patches in, QLOC, unlike Capcom, have done all they could to truly make this the definitive version of RE4 given their limitations. Even if you have to play the game at 30 FPS with standart textures, you still get a version with all DLC (unless you are German, because again: Capcom), proper PC controls (you still have to deal with tank controls, but at least you get proper QTE prompts, rebindable keys and mouse aiming) and basic modding support with a HD mod project being worked on as we speak, which is set to replace EVERY texture with a HD one.\nIn conclusion: This is a decent port and QLOC did everything they could to fix and improve it (unlike Capcom which can't be bothered to patch RE5 more than once after they did a ♥♥♥♥-poor job of porting it to Steamworks, instead just adding trading cards and stickying fan fixes for gamebreaking bugs).","February 12","true","37.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is not easy and not for anyone who enjoyed RE6, as they are leagues apart. The horror elements are strong and pop up everywhere and the game handles survival well enough by pitting you against enough enemies with limited supplies, and expecting you and a partner to survive. The puzzles are decent and still prevalent, the shooting is stellar, the mechanics of the game have enough action to stay interesting, and most deaths wont be cheap, minus the QTE that this game spawned in the series. This game is easily head ans shoulders above its series' counterparts and a true highlight of a Resident Evil that kept true to its tank-like survival horror style and the sequels which were inspired by the true life of Michael Bay.

I'm just going to gush about Resident Evil 4 for a bit. This game is my favourite of ALL TOYME.\n\nFirst time I played this game was on the Wii many years ago. I had never played a Resident Evil game and didnt play many third person shooters, let alone horror games. I had only seen a few Youtube videos about the game and that was enough for me to want to try and play it. And oh my Gosh this game is perfect. Its atmospheric, the designs of everything is so eerie and creepy, the action is great, the learning curve is perfect, the puzzles aren't too difficult, the bosses OH THE BOSSES ARE SO COOL.

Kennedy, one of the greatest Zombie survivors and characters in all of Resident Evil, play him as he fights his way through another Virus called the Plagas where he will verse a Village of seriously ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of Zombies, Creatures and (Pedos) I mean Very powerful Villains who kidnap little girls Who is the President’s Daughter.\n\nGraphics:\nFrom when this was created is was my favourite and at top rank with Final Fantasy X. The graphics and scenarios as well as cinematic were outstanding, as you wonder into the abyss and unknown terrains you can admire some beautiful scenes and really appreciate the games developed as it’s taken from the previous games from 1-3. With the Characters, bosses and the way the texture was layed out I would give it top marks.\n\nGame play:\nThis game will have you on the edge of your seat and will test you reflexes to the max as you fight of Villages and guys with Potato Sacks on their head, Which when you hear the noise will get you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ your panties if you don’t know what’s to come or even if you still do. If you were a controller player then its pretty standard with the aiming and shooting and activation buttons and will take time to switch to keyboard and mouse and vice-versa.\nThis game give you tons of puzzles, characters backgrounds, random Enemies and an amazing new way of carrying items as you are given a suitcase to carry out your items and Weapons.\nThe fun doesn’t even stop there. After completing the game you have the chance to continue the story as you play with Ada Wong in her story line. And Mercenaries as where you get to play with many Characters Such as Krauser, HUNK and ALBERT ♥♥♥♥ING WESKER (THE LEGEND OF ALL VILLAINS)\n\nAdvantage:\nThis game will challenge even the best of players and as the Story-line continues on Leon S. Kennedy you will not be disappointed in any of the game, with funny Quotes, Merchants who you will love/hate.\nThere are Special Figures and bonus packs which come with the game so no add that’ll keep the game interesting and with surprises around every corner you will always be happy with this game.\n\nDisadvantage:\nThe only things I truly believe that’ll frustrate you, would be the Ai as sometimes it’s hard to try and command Ashley to do what you want in certain situations that would probably get you killed as she runs towards the danger because she found weed...I mean Herbs.\n\nOverall:\nI do believe this is my favourite Resident Evil game and has been for a very long time, with everything from the story-line, Cinematic, game play, and the way the game was structured. I would give this game my 10/10 this is including all the flaws.\nThis is Hands Down the best Resident Evil game in my Opinion and I do believe those who are Resident Evil Fan would also agree with me too.\nThank you for reading and Peace Out.","June 20, 2015","true","45.1"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Now I own it on steam and plan to do the same (first run is always with the Red9!). RE4 is a love it or hate it turn for the franchise, taking you out of the traditional survival horror perspective, and making it almost more "first person survival" as you never leave your character and can aim freely as well as interact with several parts of the environment. You're still on a linear path, but it's a "explore this area if you want" linear path. Unlike previous games where you had to time your head shots to "close encounters with a shotgun", or lost yourself as you walk around an awkward corner to wonder where you are on the screen. I'm a 80's kid and grew up on RE games. RE2 is still my favorite, RE1 would be better but I'm still scarred by the original cover and voice acting. RE4 is a excellent transition to what the franchise was heading towards. You either love it or hate it, but really you should love it, since if you don't, you're really just waiting for a modern RE2.","June 20, 2015","true","29.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This was the first Resident Evil I played, and one of my first M-rated game and I'm glad it was. Personally, and like popular opinion, this is one of the best in the franchise.\n\nThe game follows and pays homage to the older titles, while changing things up for the better. Its tank-like controls from the first 3 games is now bearable with the 3rd-person/over-shoulder camera, but adds some tension in combat. While some/large parts of the game are escort segments, Ashley's AI is relatively painless and isn't too difficult to manage(It's a breeze if you unlock a certain something). The visuals are dated after 10 years (Writing this review as of 2015) but manage to maintain the creepy silent hill-esque environment. The tension and atmoshpere of survival horror is definitely present, while keeping combat much less stiff than the previous. Progression feels good and replayability is definitely there. The weapons come in just the right amount and each feel different in their own right. The story is kinda cheesy, but with the "virus/parasites" at hand what can you expect. The extra gamemodes add a more action-y way to play while netting shiny rewards and expanding on some parts of the main story.  I don't to give anything away or spoil anything, but Resident Evil 4 is definitely worth picking up if you are already a fan of the series, played it before, or never played a Resident Evil game.\n\n\n(Also ♥♥♥♥ Regenetors, those things made me shut of the game the very first time I ecountered them)","July 18, 2015","true","31.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story starts off trying to be grim, disturbing and serious than halfway through the game the story decides to become completely ridiculous and not take itself seriously.\n\nThe gameplay is a significant change from the previous games: you now have a third person over shoulder view point with precision aiming though you still control like a tank, (moving forward and backwards but turning left and right) there are a lot more enemies this time round and they are basically piñatas and drop health items, ammo and money, there’s a currency system where you can by weapons and upgrades from a merchant and you can also sell treasure to the merchant, your inventory system is now a suit case with a grid and all of your times are now represented as diagrams varying in size from the smallest being an egg and the largest being a shotgun or a sniper rifle, typewriters are much more common now and you can use them how many times you want now instead of having limited saves on ink ribbons, you also have quite a varied enemy roster from snakes, to your standard human enemies, to the heavies, giant bugs, dogs and the infamous man with a chainsaw aka Jason Voorhees from part 2, and the gameplay itself usually shifts and changes quite a lot. There are still boss fights and puzzles but for the most part this is a third person shooter more than anything. Oh yeah and you have to escort Ashley for half of the game.\n\nThe things I don’t like about this game are:\n\nThe quick time events. Sometimes you’ll just be watching a cut scene than all of a sudden QUICK TIME EVENT and then you die and have to watch the cut scene over and over because you weren’t quick enough the first time it the buttons to press change each time.\n\nAshley graham: one you have to escort her for half of the game which is bad enough (luckily if there’s a dumpster you can just throw her into it and clear the area first) but also she’s really annoying, how many times did you want to twist her head of her shoulders every time she says: “LEEEEOOONNN, HAAAAAAAAALLLPPPP!!!” “HALP ME LEON!!” and every time she screams…ughh…\n\nEven when you’ve upgraded the handguns its random of how many shots it takes to blow someone’s head off.\n\nThis game can be quite frustrating at times but it’s not all that bad. (Resident evil 5 gets the crown for being the most frustrating and annoying)\n\nBut for the most part this is a fun game to play, it’s the only third person resident evil game that I would say is definitely worth playing.","April 16, 2014","true","51.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You probably have already played RE4 at some point, so this is going to be a "port report". First off, the game speed is tied to the framerate and you get to pick between a 30 and 60 FPS lock. Now although this is an old game, you are probably going to need at least a Quad-core CPU and more than 3GB of RAM if you want to run it at 60 and not experience any slowdowns even with the standart textures. The game was never meant to work at 60 FPS, and this is especially obvious when it's raining and the framerate gets cut in half, but I think this is probably because I'm barely over the minimum requirements. Also, I believe that 6 patches in, QLOC, unlike Capcom, have done all they could to truly make this the definitive version of RE4 given their limitations. Even if you have to play the game at 30 FPS with standart textures, you still get a version with all DLC (unless you are German, because again: Capcom), proper PC controls (you still have to deal with tank controls, but at least you get proper QTE prompts, rebindable keys and mouse aiming) and basic modding support with a HD mod project being worked on as we speak, which is set to replace EVERY texture with a HD one.\nIn conclusion: This is a decent port and QLOC did everything they could to fix and improve it (unlike Capcom which can't be bothered to patch RE5 more than once after they did a ♥♥♥♥-poor job of porting it to Steamworks, instead just adding trading cards and stickying fan fixes for gamebreaking bugs).","February 12","true","37.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This was the first Resident Evil I played, and one of my first M-rated game and I'm glad it was. Personally, and like popular opinion, this is one of the best in the franchise.\n\nThe game follows and pays homage to the older titles, while changing things up for the better. Its tank-like controls from the first 3 games is now bearable with the 3rd-person/over-shoulder camera, but adds some tension in combat. While some/large parts of the game are escort segments, Ashley's AI is relatively painless and isn't too difficult to manage(It's a breeze if you unlock a certain something). The visuals are dated after 10 years (Writing this review as of 2015) but manage to maintain the creepy silent hill-esque environment. The tension and atmoshpere of survival horror is definitely present, while keeping combat much less stiff than the previous. Progression feels good and replayability is definitely there. The weapons come in just the right amount and each feel different in their own right. The story is kinda cheesy, but with the "virus/parasites" at hand what can you expect. The extra gamemodes add a more action-y way to play while netting shiny rewards and expanding on some parts of the main story.  I don't to give anything away or spoil anything, but Resident Evil 4 is definitely worth picking up if you are already a fan of the series, played it before, or never played a Resident Evil game.\n\n\n(Also ♥♥♥♥ Regenetors, those things made me shut of the game the very first time I ecountered them)","July 18, 2015","true","31.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story starts off trying to be grim, disturbing and serious than halfway through the game the story decides to become completely ridiculous and not take itself seriously.\n\nThe gameplay is a significant change from the previous games: you now have a third person over shoulder view point with precision aiming though you still control like a tank, (moving forward and backwards but turning left and right) there are a lot more enemies this time round and they are basically piñatas and drop health items, ammo and money, there’s a currency system where you can by weapons and upgrades from a merchant and you can also sell treasure to the merchant, your inventory system is now a suit case with a grid and all of your times are now represented as diagrams varying in size from the smallest being an egg and the largest being a shotgun or a sniper rifle, typewriters are much more common now and you can use them how many times you want now instead of having limited saves on ink ribbons, you also have quite a varied enemy roster from snakes, to your standard human enemies, to the heavies, giant bugs, dogs and the infamous man with a chainsaw aka Jason Voorhees from part 2, and the gameplay itself usually shifts and changes quite a lot. There are still boss fights and puzzles but for the most part this is a third person shooter more than anything. Oh yeah and you have to escort Ashley for half of the game.\n\nThe things I don’t like about this game are:\n\nThe quick time events. Sometimes you’ll just be watching a cut scene than all of a sudden QUICK TIME EVENT and then you die and have to watch the cut scene over and over because you weren’t quick enough the first time it the buttons to press change each time.\n\nAshley graham: one you have to escort her for half of the game which is bad enough (luckily if there’s a dumpster you can just throw her into it and clear the area first) but also she’s really annoying, how many times did you want to twist her head of her shoulders every time she says: “LEEEEOOONNN, HAAAAAAAAALLLPPPP!!!” “HALP ME LEON!!” and every time she screams…ughh…\n\nEven when you’ve upgraded the handguns its random of how many shots it takes to blow someone’s head off.\n\nThis game can be quite frustrating at times but it’s not all that bad. (Resident evil 5 gets the crown for being the most frustrating and annoying)\n\nBut for the most part this is a fun game to play, it’s the only third person resident evil game that I would say is definitely worth playing.","April 16, 2014","true","51.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The controls for the PC may be a bit dodgy at first, and may take a little tweeking in the options, but once you get the hang of it, it's super fluint and works wonderfully. My only complaint is sometimes whenever I enter my inventory to equip another weapon, I leave the inventory and Leon for no reason yet known to me turns around in the complete opposite direction away from the enemies, and it usually results in taking a hit or even getting killed. This happens a lot and I don't know if it's a glitch or what, but it does get annoying once it happens the 5th or 6th time.","July 9, 2014","true","11.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've been playing Resident Evil since the 2nd game and I have to say they really rebooted the franchise in a amazing way with this title.\n\nFrom the controls to the gameplay everything seemed to come together.  With all that being said I have to caution you about this HD version of the game as I ran into some issues that soured my gaming experience a bit with this title.\n\nThe most jarring complaint I have with this game was the sudden drop in frame rate during certain moments. It's hard for me to believe that a game this old despite the HD update could not maintain a constant 60fps when certain particle effects like rain or a large amount of characters were on screen at one time. It even effected one of the boss battles something that could have easily taken me out of the game if it ultimately deterred my ability to move forward.\n\nMy second complaint was the controller support. While the game did detect all of my buttons there were some weird moments during quick time events where they would not register.\n\nThere was one point during the game that I basically had to use the mouse and keyboard just to get to the next area and unfortunately once I switched,  my controller was no longer responsive and I had to use the alternative until I could find a save point..not the best time with that.\n\nWith these two issues paying for the game at the full price would have felt like a mistake. Lucky for me I grabbed this during a humble bundle sale.\n\nI'm giving this a recommendation because despite some of the bad experiences, this is a good game and you should play it. I just want to make people aware there may be some issues.","June 2","true","26.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/254700/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","975 products in account","Quick rundown: Resident Evil 4 is an action/horror hybrid that plays similar to the Dead Space games, and in terms of mechanics is probably halfway between the original Resident Evil games and the action oriented RE 5 & 6. The controls are rather clunky if you’ve played the later games (like me) and the graphics are dated, which should be no surprise since the game is over 10 years old (and is a console port). I remember the old version of RE 4 didn’t even have an exit option, you had to alt + F4 to quit the game. They fixed that for the Steam version though.\n\nI’ve never played the first Resident Evil games since I play games on PC, but if you have then I’m sure you’ll recognize the main character Leon Kennedy. As Leon, it’s your job to find and rescue the president’s missing daughter Ashley from a cult of zombie-like villagers in a dark and gloomy farming village. You find almost immediately that despite appearances these villagers are ferociously and fanatically protective of the area, and will attack you on sight with any weapon they can get their hands on. Fortunately they’re mostly slow moving… like zombies. The villagers are being controlled by the cult leader through the use of an ancient type of parasite called Las Plagas that can cause grotesque transformations in victims, which means monstrous enemies for you to fight!\n\nYou control Leon through the third person perspective which is kind of badly implemented because Leon covers about a quarter of the screen at times and the slow camera control makes it difficult to see around him. Since the game was a port from a console, you have a slight advantage with keyboard+mouse when it comes to aiming your gun, but the game is pretty forgiving when it comes to where your bullets go. The enemies will run up to you, but when they get within striking distance they suddenly start walking really slow, giving you some time to aim and shoot.  If you get a headshot, the enemy will flinch and give you a few seconds to walk up and do a roundhouse kick. The kick option is only available if the enemy is stunned and it’s not even that strong, but what’s important is that it will knock the guy down so you can run over and stick him a few times with your knife. This is something you will absolutely have to master, because ammo is scarce enough in the game that you’ll need to use as little as possible on each enemy.\n\nSpeaking of ammo, you have limited inventory space to store ammo for all of your weapons. In fact, inventory space will probably limit your choices in weapons more than cost, because if your inventory is filled with guns, you won’t have space for ammo, grenades, and healing items. Throughout the game you’ll get the opportunity to buy more inventory space, but it never gets comfortably large. You’ll always have to pick and choose what you want to keep and what to sell.\n\nPros:\n+Spooky environment, an engaging story, and an assortment of creepy enemies to fight, from the slow moving villagers to the giant bosses.\n+There’s a lot going on in this game: puzzle solving, running for your life (with quick time events), and mini games such as a shooting range. All of which adds up to a long and entertaining game.\n+There are a couple of bonus games in there after beating the main campaign. You can play as Ada Wong in 2 short campaigns that add a few more hours of gameplay. It took me about 24 hours to beat everything, though I may have spent more time than necessary killing every enemy I could find.\n\nCons:\n-The controls are really hard to get used to since the mouse look is so slow and you cannot move while aiming your gun. Speaking of which, it’s sometimes annoying how weak your guns seem.\n-While playing the Ada campaign, the game’s movie cutscenes are really, really low quality. It’s a technical issue, but if you’re playing the game in 1080p and suddenly one of the movie cutscenes occur, you’ll wonder what the hell happened to your screen.\n\nOverall, the game is worthy of your time, and if you plan on playing Resident Evil 5 and 6 after, you should probably play RE 4 to know what’s going on with Las Plagas and Leon. Be warned that the game can be quite difficult for new players on your first run through. Difficulty doesn’t affect Steam achievements, but you cannot change the difficulty during the game unless you keep dying in the same place, and the game asks if you want to try easy mode.\n","February 11","true","26.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

We play it for the fun, survival horror style elements , and decent gunplay. The lack of moving and aiming certainly feels dated, but this revolutionized the over the shoulder Third Person shooter. As I said, the game feels dated, but the new HD makeover looks pretty good.\nFinally, we have a Resident Evil game that runs at a constant 60 FPS, and it looks very fluid. That being said the framerate drops for some reason when reloading any sniper rifle. Note: You will need a pretty powerful PC to run this game on max settings.\nThe dated feel and tank controls may turn off some "newer" gamers, but by itself, it still remains to be one of the greatest survival horror games in existence , and should be checked out by any fans of the the Resident Evil series, or survivial horror fans who missed it when it first came out.\n8.5/10\n","May 11, 2014","true","17.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

Although it is an action game sooner than a horror one, it is the calculated kind of action game. You have to think through what you're doing, and luckily the professional difficulty is only unlocked when you pass the game at least once on normal difficulty so you will already know what you will be facing and what you're supposed to be before you choose a dificulty that's actually very challenging.\n\nTo play this game you need skill and a lot of patience, as well as quick reflexes. The QTEs can sometimes be pretty annoying.\n\nThe game still has some bugs, but updates are constantly being released and there is even a public beta that gives you the newest patches before they are officially released, and the game looks a lot better than the original.\n\nThere is a lot of content in this game. It starts out slow, you will probably be wondering how this is a Resident Evil game, but trust me when I say that it gets a lot better later. The enemies you face are completely different later on and the bosses are unique and offer great boss battle experiences.\n\nThere are a lot of treasures and secrets in each level, and by the time you finish the game you will most likely want to play through it again! The game offers huge replayability! When you finish the game you get a cleared save, which lets you start a new game with the same difficulty as the cleared save's difficulty with your entire inventory from the end of the game, and you even unlock new things you can buy in shops by completing the main game as well as the DLCs. It's also important to note you unlock new costumes, not just for Leon but for other characters as well, and you can choose which to use when you start the game.\n\nThe downside for modern gamers is that it's not a fast-paced kind of shooter. It requires a lot of concentration and sheer willpower to beat some levels and if you never played classic hardcore games before you will probably not like this one either. The aiming feels awkward, your enemies come in large numbers and deal a lot more damage than you do, so you will have to skirmish and play safe a lot in this game. The graphics, although greatly improved when compared to the original, still have that classic look and if you're used to playing games like Crysis or the new Call od Duty games or similar, you will probably not like this game's graphics. It's an excellent game, but you have to have a certain appreciation for old-school titles.\n\nIt is a difficult game. Maybe not Dark Souls difficulty, but by the time you face some of the end-game enemies, you will probably be praising the Sun with each victory.\n\nTo sum up, a must-have for fans of classic games and the Resident Evil franchise!","April 17, 2014","true","68.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

A very influential game, so influential than ruined or saved Horror games, depending on who you ask.","October 25, 2015","true","23.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

In many action games before and after RE4, the developers seem to be struggling to find a gameplay loop that is fun for the player. If "something fun" is found, the instinct is to repeat the success over the entire game. Many successful action games are designed like this, and the best ones manage to use graphics, story, and positive feedback mechanisms such as collectibles to mask the repetition for the player. Another common strategy to mask repetition is to mix up the successful gameplay loop with scripted sequences that give the impression that gameplay is changing, when you are actually just pressing buttons to progress through interactive cutscenes.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, you have a few game series that are not designed with the described "repeat success" mindset. A particularly rare philosophy is when a developer sees a successful gameplay loop as a starting point, and tries to introduce new successful loops through an entire game. The "moment of fun" is explored and investigated from every interesting angle, but after that it is time to move on to the next thing. The problem is, developing games according to this philosophy requires really talented people, lots of time and huge piles of money. Nintendo is the the only reliable producer of these type of games, with the 3d Mario series and the Legend of Zelda games.\n\nAnd that brings us to RE4. RE4 was developed with exactly the type of mindset that makes the Mario and Zelda games so unique. It was a revelation to play a third person shooter, or for that matter any type of shooting game, that explored enemy encounters to their fullest potential, but then briskly moved on to the next thing. There was no "trickery" to give a fake sense of gameplay progression. There were no "reskinned" levels with the same challenges. There was no overabundance of scripted sequences. There was no reliance on story to motivate the player to go through boring gameplay.\n\nInstead of this, the game had a string of perfectly tuned enemy encounters, where almost every one brought something new to the table. However, RE4 did not just provide variation from one encounter to the next, but it also unified the encounters with a strong sense of progression, which it arguably did even better than the aforementioned Nintendo games. The increased player agency from finding weapons, pesos and buying upgrades were almost perfectly tuned against the challenge level in RE4, which made it so depressing to play RE5 (or RE6) where they just didn't care due to the impossibility of balancing coop anyway.","November 13, 2014","true","0.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Gunplay which is extremely responsive and precise. You can even go to new game plus runs where you carry over your old weapons .While this makes the game easy yet it is satisfying to kill that boss which gave you so much trouble previously.\n2. Movement schemes which to some may seem hindering yet the pacing of the enemies make it viable.\n3. Separate ways and Assignment ada which are both excellent and show the story from a different perspective.\n4. The mercenaries. This is truly an amazing mode for RE4. You get to play as Leon,Ada,Hunk,Krauser and Wesker in 5 challenge maps. These give a new flavour to the gameplay and playing as Hunk ,Wesker or Krauser is extremely enjoyable.\n5.Boss fights. Some of the boss fights in this game are truly epic. The bosses are well balanced and can be taken down by simple handgun or a single shot rocket launcher .\n6. Weapons. No weapon is bad. The puny handgun you get at the beginning can help you till the end of the game. Even weapons which aren't considered good like mine thrower can be used effectively.\n7. This game isn't newbie friendly. You will have to give time and even then you will die alot. You'll have to give it time and learn to play.\n\nCons:-\n1. Quick time events and button mash events are never a good thing.\n2. The Story is nice but the appearence of Ada as the mysterious lady and the age old cliched dialogues are not sweet on my ears.\n3. The performance can be a mixed bag for many. The graphics aren't that great and the 30/60fps cap occasionally slows down the game.\n\nOverall i'd say it is an amazing game although this port and the previous one leaves a lot to be desired in terms of performance.","December 25, 2014","true","65.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

In fact, it is probably tied with Ocarina of Time as my favorite game of all time. I played and beat the original on the gamecube hundreds of times, and I could not miss out on the opportunity to finally play it on my PC. My experience thus far with this port has been nothing short of fantastic. It is the same game I fell in love with a decade ago, but with a few neat bells and whistles to spruce it up. The HD looks good, but can be jarring at first, since I was very accustomed to the gritty looking old graphics. The sharpened look of everything actually may even make things look even faker than they used to, but it never detracts from the experience. The only real annoyance I have had is an inability to fully customize the controls for a gamepad. I have become very set in my ways using a gamecube controller, and some of the button mapping (while making sense) is just not for me. I keep pushing Y to go to my item screen, and keep pressing X to run. It will take a very long time to retrain myself, since the old controls are second nature/habit for me, and I wish I could just map them as I wish and do away with that learning curve. Other than this, the game seems flawless to me. I have encountered no bugs or performance issues, and have been enjoying this playthrough.","February 27, 2014","true","38.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

In my opinion, this is the best out of all the Resident Evil games. Maybe it's the nostalgia, but I just can't stop playing it.\n\nThe first thing you need to realise, is that this game uses a 'tank' control scheme. What I mean by this is that you cant move while aiming your gun. You cannot side-strafe like in the 5th and 6th games, making it very awkward to play without a controller. That being said, the controls are as good as they can be on a keyboard and mouse, but I would still recommend using a gamepad.  I think these controls actual help the gameplay in several ways. First off, the game is in third person view, which obscures a lot of your view to begin with. Second, not being able to move or see at wide angles really helps the atmosphere. It makes you feel anxious in battles, especially when you know something is creeping up behind you.\n\nThe gameplay is challenging and fun, but it may seem a bit repetitive at times. You will battle many bosses throughout the game, but they will all have a different style to them. Some bosses will have you running around enclosed spaces, trying to avoid their attacks, while some others will have a mostly stationary boss that sends in minions and hits you with powerful slow attacks. There are many weapons you can unlock and buy, including a rocket launcher (which can be used to cheat through some of the harder bosses.) The inventory system is one of my favorites in any game. You have to fit all of your guns, ammo, grenades, rocket launchers, and herbs into one tiny briefcase by roatating and organzing each and every item. Just picking up items is a puzzle!\n\nThe graphics are nothing to write home about, and this particular port has bunch of framerate problems, but it isn't anything I would regret paying for. In the end, I would recommend this game over any other Resident evil game.\n\nAnd as a side note, the games' title is all lowercase letters in your steam library. This is a minor flaw, but when you have over 500 games like me, having only ONE lowercase steam title is irritating. Unfortunately, no amount of ♥♥♥♥♥ing will get this fixed, as it is a copyright problem.","June 26, 2014","true","68.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's still one of the best games you can play, and even more so if you're a zombie fan. It kind of started the trend of the game being even less survival horror. But if you play it again after playing Resident Evils 5 and 6, you will see how much more similar 4 is to the older games.\n\nI won't lie, yes I am a zombie fan, but this game is just a classic.","May 5, 2015","true","58.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It was first released in 2005 which makes it more then 10 years old, yet it still looks great\n\nGameplay\n\nIt is a port from consoles to a PC - second one. I played both, first one and this and I can say that this one is much better. Although controls can feel still sort of clunky, weird but bareable. Aiming is what you'd expect from console port... it is "consolish" at first it may feel really, really weird but after some 15-20 mins people will get used to it (whilst playing on mouse).As for the gameplay itself, for me game ran smoothly expcept for several occurances (reloading sniper rifle, some boss fights) when there was stuttering and drop in FPS rate, now that just might be me... eitherway it wasn't a big deal. The game is not that scary for those who are comming for horror factor. There are few times when you get scared but they are rather scarse... although if you are like me and get scared by sounds of weird breething and scary music, you ll be satisfied well enough. What I really enjoyed were Boss fights as they are each very different, there is wide enough range of enemies and changes in locations. What can get kinda annoying is protection of one NPC but that is only during few parts of one chapter if I remember correctly (thank god). There is wide range of weapons to choose from and upgrades (YAY!) for said weapons which makes gameplay and managing your money fun. You'll also need to look for hidden treasures and manage your ammo smart as it can be scarse at times. During the 5 chapters you'll encounter some 10 puzzles, some are fun, some are less so. Overall game plays nice and hours pass fast while you play, you'll enjoy your dose of cheesy lines and puns, tough macho proclamations by your characters and foes, few WTF moments and a lot of fun while shooting zombies heads off.\n\nGraphics\n\nAs I stated before, the game is about 10 years old so don't expect miracles, some textures look good some don't. Overall I think that the game aged rather well, and gameplay makes up for the aging of the graphics anyways. What does look weird and goofy at times are explosions, those just don't look like explosions at all... it looks more like yellow bubble than explosion. But that is just small detail, I don't expect people are going to buy decade old game in expectation of graphics spectacle.\n\nExtras\n\nOutside of a main "campaign" or story mode, game offers several minigames that can keep you entertained for few more ours. Two of minigames are sort of mini campaigns, the third is sort of arcade stile game, where you play on maps from main game and you need to collect as much points as possible from killing zombies while under time limit. By playing these game you can unlock new costumes for characters in the game and more characters for the arcade style "mercinaries" game.\n\nSummary\n\nOverall if you enjoy console games, bit of action, bit of horror, 3rd person shooter and boss fighting I would not hesitate to buy the game, although I would recommend to do so, if its on sale as full price seems a bit much.  7.5/10","January 4","true","39.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

All-in-all, this story had a far happier ending. The graphics look good. Not fantastic, as they're simply the same textures as previous installments upscaled to a higher resolution, but definitely nicer than the PS2 or Gamecube versions. There's actually NATIVE MOUSE SUPPORT, which works well enough (though it could certainly be more responsive)\n\nProbably the biggest nuisance this game brings to modern PC gamers is the control setup. Yes, it still utilizes the tank controls of old. You have wasd controls, but a/d TURN you rather than making you strafe. The mouse DOES NOT MAKE YOU TURN. It only rotates the camera and moves your weapon in aiming mode. This will feel extremely awkward at first, but it WILL feel better after time. If you can't stand it, though, then I would recommend using a gamepad. Tank controls are always more intuitive on a gamepad.\n\nIn the end, this is exactly what you'd expect it to be, unless you're expecting yet another muddy and cruddy port. Finally, we PC gamers get to experience RE4 as it's meant to be, rather than as a broken mess.\n\nPS: Some people are complaining about their game playing in slow motion. This is due to the fixed framerate. If your computer can't handle the game at 60fps, it will slow the game in order to keep that framerate. The quickest fix is to lower the framerate setting to fixed 30fps (unfortunately, there is no current way to unlock the fps).","February 28, 2014","true","21.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

As Leon you'll be tasked with rescuing the president's daughter from a group of fanatics and you'll soon realize things are way darker than you've expected.\nWhile showing its age in places and strying somewhat far from the slow burn horror of its predecessors RE4 is a great game finally given a worthy port.\n\nPROS:\n\n-good sound design and soundtrack\n\n-great atmosphere\n\n-a pretty straightforward and less cheesy story that works quite well\n\n-the infected villagers and other bioweapons you'll encounter are a breath of fresh air from the usual zombies and'll require new strategies\n\n-great boss battles\n\n-the game is more action oriented than the previous ones thus providing an enjoyable and challenging experience where you are often pitted against many enemies: you'll need to strategize\n\n-great length, expect at least 14 hours (plus extra modes after you complete the game if you're so inclined)\n\n\nNEUTRAL:\n\n-the standard RE cheesy dialogues clash a bit too much with the serious tone of the story\n\n-while the graphical update is welcome it's a bit of a mixed bag, character and monster models are pretty nice but most textures aren't too sharp\n\n-puzzles are very simple, I'm personally fine with it but some might miss the more complex ones found in previous episodes\n\n-sections where you have to babysit the presiden't daughter can be a bit annoying\n\n\n\nCONS:\n\n-cramped camera\n\n-controls feel a bit sluggish overall and betray the game's age\n\n-instadeath quicktime events during cutscenes are just annoying\n\n-a couple of quicktime events are extremely buggy if the game is set at 60fps, they're almost impossible to pull off and you'll have to quit the game (losing about 10 minutes of progress if it happens in the mine cart section) and set it to a slightly nauseating 30fps to pass them\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=640302711\n\nResident Evil 4 abandons the old fixed camera shots and most of the sense of dread in favour of an over-the shoulder camera and tense fights that often pit you against many enemies able to use tools such as weapons, shields or objects in the environment: it's a big change, one that not only provides a fresh experience but that also influenced the next games both in plot and gameplay.\n\nIt works, and it works quite well even though it's not as innovative as it was when it first came out: in fact the somewhat clunky controls and cramped camera will possibly make modern players turn up their noses. It must be said that as awkward as they might be at times old design choices like being rooted on the spot when aiming and having a limited turn radius do evoke a genuine sense of dread when you're faced with several enemies scrambling from different directions or simply need to target a bioweapon's vulnerable spot while trying to not be shredded to bits.\n\nMy only complains are the annoying quicktime events during cutscenes, they add little to nothing and are just frustrating when you miss them and have to watch the cutscene all over again. Even worse are two unsolved bugs where Leon fails to climb on ledges if the game is set to 60fps: the biggest culprit here is the mine cart section where the previous save point is 10 to 15 minutes beforehand. Having to quit the game to set it to 30fps and then having to start over to pass the bugged QTE was not fun at all and is a bug that'd have been solved.\n\nEven with a few niggling issues Resident Evil 4 is a great game in the series and the last remaster finally gives us a worthy port to enjoy on PC: it's a definite purchase for fans of the genre, maybe just read beforehand on the two bugged QTEs to avoid any annoyances.","March 11","true","14.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

In my opinion, this is the best out of all the Resident Evil games. Maybe it's the nostalgia, but I just can't stop playing it.\n\nThe first thing you need to realise, is that this game uses a 'tank' control scheme. What I mean by this is that you cant move while aiming your gun. You cannot side-strafe like in the 5th and 6th games, making it very awkward to play without a controller. That being said, the controls are as good as they can be on a keyboard and mouse, but I would still recommend using a gamepad.  I think these controls actual help the gameplay in several ways. First off, the game is in third person view, which obscures a lot of your view to begin with. Second, not being able to move or see at wide angles really helps the atmosphere. It makes you feel anxious in battles, especially when you know something is creeping up behind you.\n\nThe gameplay is challenging and fun, but it may seem a bit repetitive at times. You will battle many bosses throughout the game, but they will all have a different style to them. Some bosses will have you running around enclosed spaces, trying to avoid their attacks, while some others will have a mostly stationary boss that sends in minions and hits you with powerful slow attacks. There are many weapons you can unlock and buy, including a rocket launcher (which can be used to cheat through some of the harder bosses.) The inventory system is one of my favorites in any game. You have to fit all of your guns, ammo, grenades, rocket launchers, and herbs into one tiny briefcase by roatating and organzing each and every item. Just picking up items is a puzzle!\n\nThe graphics are nothing to write home about, and this particular port has bunch of framerate problems, but it isn't anything I would regret paying for. In the end, I would recommend this game over any other Resident evil game.\n\nAnd as a side note, the games' title is all lowercase letters in your steam library. This is a minor flaw, but when you have over 500 games like me, having only ONE lowercase steam title is irritating. Unfortunately, no amount of ♥♥♥♥♥ing will get this fixed, as it is a copyright problem.","June 26, 2014","true","68.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Nevertheless, I just completed the game once again (as well as the last achievement for 100% completion). I don’t know how many times I have, I stopped counting after 20.\n\nHowever, I have played most versions of this game and it’s easy to say that this is the definitive version. It has everything that any remakes had, all the additional modes, the additional costumes and the additional weapons. It also features higher-resolution textures and for the first time ever, somewhat functional keyboard and mouse control. To be completely honest however, this is one of the only shooters that I would much rather play with a controller.\n\nIt has everything and it looks prettier than ever. Runs at any 16:9 resolution (I played in 2560x1440) and is capped at 60 FPS. It’s kind of a joke that they’re still making money off of this game over 10 years later but I think the 20$ is well worth it. If you already know about this game, that’s about it. If not, keep reading.\n\nThis game came out 11 years ago as I’m writing this. It was mind-blowing for its time. The only thing that held back its amazing graphics were the low-res textures, which have now been updated. Visually, it aged very well.\n\nGames have evolved a lot since then. While at the time the story felt amazing, it feels pretty simple and cheesy today. Most of the dialogues is actually really cheesy. I really don’t mind it however, the game feels very to the point. The story supports the game and not the other way around.\n\nYou will often see things that do not have an explanation other than convenience and honestly, that’s fine. Some games nowadays are so anal about being realistic that it removes a lot from the game. I do not care that this mysterious merchant seems omnipresent for no reason and that nobody seems to care he’s selling weapons to their enemies, because I want my weapons and upgrades!\n\nIn that sense, the game has a much more “Arcade” feel than most games of that genre that come out nowadays. I absolutely love the theming in this, the areas are all very distinct and they have completely different enemies and environments.\n\nThe controls could feel a bit dated however. Keep in mind that this game was released on the Gamecube first and was designed entirely around it. As such, the controls might seem very odd and unconventional. This is due to the fact that the Gamecube controller made use of a single Joystick most of the time, while the other was rarely used. Because of this, both moving and aiming is done with the same Joystick.\n\nThis might seem annoying at first, but if you are familiar with survival horrors, the restricted vision and movement are often part of what makes it stressful. In this game, your character does not have a steady aim, even when standing still. Shooting while running is out of the question.\n\nThere are tons of things to collect in this game. However, unlike many games, these are actually useful. Instead of running around gathering feathers that serve literally no purpose, you will be incentivized to look all around for ammo, grenades and health. It never felt like a chore to me, but simply a necessity to survive. Other collectibles are treasures that can be sold for money, which you can then use to purchase new weapons or upgrades for those you already own. This is one of the few games where looking for treasures felt rewarding and useful, instead of being there just for the sake of making the game longer or giving you a trophy for it. You do it for your own benefit and if you don’t it’s your problem.\n\nSpeaking of weapons and upgrades, a cool thing about this game is that every weapon is good in its own way. Every single weapon as unique special ability and comparable stats to others. In the end, it boils down to what you prefer. You never have to feel like you’ve upgraded your weapon for nothing if you can purchase a new one and you can always sell the ones you have if you want to purchase a new one. It also makes the game very fun to replay as you get to try new weapons.\n\nThe game is not extremely long but your first playthrough will most likely last you much longer than any subsequent ones. The game can actually be completed very quickly, which in my book, indicates that it is well designed and doesn’t have too many tedious parts. It features a new game + mode which lets you carry over your stuff and have revenge on everyone that scared the ♥♥♥♥ out of you.\n\nAI is relatively simple but surprisingly reactive. You probably already know it’s a zombie game, but in this game, the zombies will walk or run, cover their faces if you aim at them, try to move and dodge, etc. This is more apparent when playing on the Professional difficulty. The headshots also feel, very, very satisfying in this (and eventually terrifying).\n\nThe added Separate Ways mode adds a cool short (4-5 hours) little story that fits with Leon’s story and “explain” some of the events. I liked how Ada’s examine comments reflected her personality instead of being simple narration. Hers were usually much more witty and sarcastic. The mercenaries is a really cool mini-game where you get to play different characters in a more arcade play style.\n\nAll in all, I think Resident Evil 4 is a perfect blend of an action third-person shooter and a survival horror game that everyone should play!","March 25","true","17.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The added ability to finally play RE4 in 60 frames per second is nice, but it breaks a lot of things.\n\nPhysics react twice as fast, certain particle effects are clearly still running at 30 fps which is jarring, and the incendiary grenade effects last half as long for whatever reason. Basically any game logic tied to the frame rate kind of goes nuts at 60 fps, but so far this seems to only be visual things and nothing like game speed.\n\nGraphics are nice, but not really any better than emulating the Wii version on Dolphin at the same resolution with a fan made texture pack. The PC version also seems to have a warm tone to the colors, it's kind of unfitting. The Wii/GCN versions have a cooler, more blueish color temperature and it suits the game much better.\n\nAudio quality is also weaker in comparison to the Wii/GCN versions, and the positional audio in the PC version is pretty bad. In the Wii version you could easily tell exactly where an enemy was due to the excellent positional audio, but in the PC version everything sounds muddled and there's no real sense of direction to any of the sound. The overall audio is at least slightly better than the horribly compressed 360/PS3 HD versions.\n\nOverall not a really bad port, but not great either. Better than the original Ubisoft PC port, and I'd say it's better than the 360/PS3 HD versions as well. Still doesn't beat emulating the Wii version on Dolphin at 1080p, but even that's not perfect with slowdowns in a few key places and weird audio skipping. Also the achievements are sad, nothing for Mercs, no fun achievements like "beat the game with only the pistol", no speed run achievements, etc. Boooooo Capcom.","February 28, 2014","true","43.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Calling it a "masterpiece" is a bit excessive, but not unjustified. Even though I never cared about the RE series, I found RE4 to be one of the best action-adventure/survival games I've ever played. This is mostly due to some fenomenal pacing, great atmosphere, huge variety of locations, enemies, weapons, and hidden treasures, as well as a lot of replay value found in both the extensive main storyline (about 10-15 hours on average) and the arcade Mercenary mode.\n\nThat said, the game has its issues. The story and characters are laughable and uninteresting, while character and camera controls have always felt clunky and weird, regardless of what type of controller was used. This is also the case for the PC port, with mouse and keyboard controls requiring some getting used to, especially since only a small portion of the keys can be rebinded, for whatever reason. The port also suffers from some minor graphical issues, and all the "Ultimate HD" thing isn't particularly impressive, with some obvious poor textures found throughout.\n\nOther than that though, it's still an amazing game finally running at 60fps. Definitely worth the money.","March 1, 2014","true","44.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I applied 60 FPS mod also enhanced texture, even ENB profile to the old PC release, and I don't think it look as good as this. I am really satisfied with this game even though it costed 20 bucks. The in engine cutscenes was what I desired for a long time. Only down part for me is that, I am really used to the keyboard control in the old release(might sound silly), but since this game is semi keyboard/mouse and does not let you to go full keyboard, I have to learn the controlling mechanism again(not a bad thing at all for newer players though).","February 27, 2014","true","55.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

You play the stories main protagonist, Leon S. Kennedy, the stereotypical definition of a super human cop, which is ironic because he was JUST a normal police officer til the zombie nation attacked.   He was sent to Europe to find out who kidnapped the presidents daughter, "Leon Help."  With his dreamy blonde hair, and his quick quips, it's no surprise that Ashley falls for our hero, and he proceeds to kill everyone in Europe who looks at him funny.\n\nPros:\nAlthough most people will disagree, I liked the unique control system that got me killed til I learn how to use it properly.  Once mastered I found it very rewarding\nThe inventory "tetris" mini game concept is also very additive, honestly if they had just made the inventory system the game I would probably have still played the s**t out of it\nThe game rewards you for headshots by making ammo seem so sacred you will pray to saint Mary for every bullet you fire\nThe weapons are very satisfying to use, but then again maybe i have a crush on leon, don't judge\n\nCons:\nThe controls can be a bit confusing to a new player, but lets be honest, if you got this game on pc you probably already enjoy the game, who am i kidding\nAshley is a f**king b**ch\nThe dialoge is so bad, it's good\nF**KING ASHELY STOP GETTING KILLED F**K\nDid I mention escort missions are toxic as h*ll?\nTo be honest though, the Ashley mechanic isn't forced on you the entire game, and honestly it adds an interesting aspect for different parts of the game\nWhat are you selling?\nWhat are you buying?\nMerchant flashes me every time I buy something\nI'm just kidding, this game is perfect\n\nConclusion:\nIf you can survive the learning curve of the controls and game play mechanics, you are in for a real treat of a survival horror game.  I remember the first time I played this game I was terrified. Mostly because I had bought the game without my parents permission and I was afraid of being caught.  Oh and the game has some of the best pacing and reward system I've ever played, hands down.  Oh, try looking up Ashley's skirt sometime, you pervert. #ballistics","September 16, 2015","true","59.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

Every fight will have you constantly thinking on your feet and having you really think about ammo managment .... (which to be fair ammo isn't TOOO sparse if you know what you're doing).  I will say that this isn't completely Dark Souls level of brutal unless you have decided to do a professional (the hardest difficulty for RE 4).\n\n\nThere are a ton of unlockables LOADS of replay value to this game and more often than not you might've  missed a few things on subsequent playthroughs, its just one of those types of games which seem quiet rare in todays era where singleplayer games are more often than not fairly short .... only to have a serious focus on multiplayer which is a shame really ...\n\nAlso well ... for how good this game was this game also marks the Decline in the RE franchise from  survival horror games with Some elements of action to full on action adventure blockbusters that .... faceplant out the door. (However I've heard RE 5 wasn't too bad but 6 and the others suffer from a bloated cast of returning characters and plot ....)\n\nAnyways with that all said ...

I don't think there's one negative review that doesn't say "I just wanna start by saying I loved this game on (insert sixth generation console here)". I'm not really sure what I dislike about this game, I just know I don't like any of it, as much as I wanted to.\n\nHeadshots just aren't a thing in this unless their heads happen to explode, effectively making the pistol entirely useless, for a good while at least. It turns out kicking them with Leons stronger-than-bullets roundhouse is the most effective way of killing them. I'm aware that they're not technically zombies, they're just extremely hard headed Spaniards but still! It seems the only good zombie game out there that isn't just trying to be a barrel of laughs for the whole family is The Last Of Us (again, I know they're not zaaahmbies!)\n\nThe controls are abysmal in pretty much the same way all of these old games are. You can't aim and move at the same time and even when you do aim it's like Leon has Parkinsons and god help you if someone throws a grenade at you (or a stick of dynamite 'cos you're in a farming village and apparently farmers always need to blow ♥♥♥♥ up), moving out of the way of one of those suckers in a tight space is like trying to dodge a fart on an escalator and even if you do manage to turn around it seems to take ten minutes before you can start moving in that direction. Oh and the camera, don't get me started, it's just awful. I played with a controller by the way, any ♥♥♥♥♥ who plays a game that was designed for a console with a keyboard and mouse and then complains that they don't work as well as they think they should shouldn't be allowed outside without adult supervision and a high-vis helmet.\n\nI think overall it just suffers from Capcoms trademark crappiness, the only games of theirs I like are the first two Onimusha games. For some reason every game has the same style, where every main character has a pretty boy haircut and is almost completely void of a personality and comes alongside a ridiculous plot.\n\nI suppose I don't like it mostly becuase I didn't play it when it came out like everyone else so I have no rose-tinted specs to view this through. That or I'm just venting my anger 'cos I haven't slept and I found out my wife's cheating on me... I lied, I don't have a wife... maybe that's why I'm venting. Point being, I wouldn't recommend buying this game if you've never played it before (which would make you an anomaly it seems). I would suggest trying out someone else's copy as a demo before you make any decisions, otherwise just don't buy it. Thankfully that's what I did, I damn near bought this a while back.","June 2, 2015","false","3.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","4","7","3","2"

One of my favorite games and one of the best games of all time. Perfectly paced, tight controls, brilliant story and excellent characters. Needless to say, when I saw this was coming to steam I preordered it on the spot. I have the game on every other system it's come out on, so why not the computer. I mean what could go wrong, it's just a port to the pc.\n\nWell, I would say something major went wrong. They locked the fps at 60.\n\nthe game runs fine, perfectly even, I'm getting the sixty frames per second as advertised. However the cost of this is that the game runs in bullet time. I get to see every frame of every animation in the game. Unless it decides to stop doing that at random intervals which result in the el gigante puching me in my face and/or smashing me into the ground. To be honest if this was just in the gameplay segments I wouldn't have a problem with it, but it's in the cutscenes. Every signle one of them.\n\nThis issue may seem to be a minor gripe, however lets take a look at this from the point of view of someone who had never played the game before.\n\nThey have heard so much about this game and are now finally able to play it since it's on the computer. They buy it and load it up. Now if their copy has the same issue as mine, the first thing they are going to notice is that in the openingcutscene the audio desyncs from the video. "it's just a glitch." they say as they continue forward. Once the cutscenes over, they get set adn start heading playing. Only to find that every step takes a second and a half and that the game seems to now be Max Payne having a fever dream. "could just be the game map loading in." So the player gets to the first house and gets another desynced cut scene. Than when it finishes the very first enemy starts lumbering over to you in slow motion. You raise you gun and prpare to fire, when the game speeds up and goes at the proper speed. Next thing the first time player knows the villager is upon them and hacking their face off with a scythe. continue this porcess though out the game.\n\nEvery time the cutscenes desync it reminds you that your playing a game and takes you out of the setting and narrative. No matter how much the games trys to set the mood again, it just doesn't stay. The broken out of sync cutscenes, the enemies playing red light green light, and the in ability to see the world in anything other than bullet time destroys this games power. You are no longer able to connect with the characters or feel for their struggle. You sit terrified that the game will speed up when facing an enemy that can one shot you, and may even find your self having trouble with quick time events where failure means death and possiby watching a cutscene over. I'm looking at you krauser.\n\nOverall a very dissapointing port to the pc and I hope that a patch comes out soon to fix this horrific mark on an outstanding game.","March 10, 2014","false","8.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","1"

Well, okay, so the Revelations series is getting increasingly promising, and RE5 certainly isn't a "bad" game by a long stretch...but on the whole, this is the last bona fide "classic" to bear the Resident Evil name.  It justifiably blew all us old ♥♥♥♥ers away when it was first released many a yonk ago, but sentimentality aside, how does this stack up in the year 2015?  Hmmm...let's see now...\n\nWell, the controls are still what many might consider a bit "clunky" (especially those who didn't "grow up" with the likes of the early RE games).  I personally feel that such limitations arguably increase the "horror" factor by rendering your character more vulnerable, but I guess that's all a matter of taste.  And while my computer is a "mere" laptop, it just happens to be a pretty expensive one that seems to run just about every game under the sun - including the notoriously demanding likes of The Evil Within - either at or close enough to top graphics.  Yet I couldn't get this game to run at anything faster than SLOW-♥♥♥♥ING-MO without dialling the graphics all the way down to 1280 X 720, and the shadows down to Medium; and even then, there was still some lag once things got dark and stormy, what with all the lightning flashes and the rain pouring down.  So, er...and I'll admit here that I'm far from a tech expert, but...I'm not entirely sure that I played the game at a truly "superior" level of graphics than I did on my Gamecube way back when.  My expectations that I'd easily be able to crank this baby up to 1920 were certainly ill-founded, let's put it that way!  So unless you have some super-mega-you-beaut computer set-up which can play literally EVERYTHING at maximum settings, I'm not entirely convinced that this is a necessary purchase for anyone who already owns the game on console.  EXCEPT, of course, for idiotic PC completists like myself, who are basically determined to render their past console purchases obsolete by putting all their eggs into one basket called Steam (still waitin' on them early RE and Silent Hill games on said distribution platform, though...hint, hint)!\n\nAs for anyone who never played this game back in the day, well...it was a staggeringly groundbreaking and influential piece of work when it first come out in 2005, but in the decade since it has arguably dated a little, and if you didn't grow up with the "tank" controls of these old RE games you'll probably just find it infuriating from the word "go".  I could be wrong, but...I'm kind of suspecting the uber-A.D.D. generations which have come since won't have the time or patience to acclimatise themselves to the old-school mechanics, especially if they are primarily accustomed to first-person shooters in which one can run and jump backwards whilst rapidly firing two pistols at once.  These ye olde third-person survival horror games had an AESTHETIC, and a PHILOSOPHY, but it's not one that's liable to translate into the ultra-modern, instant gratification age.\n\nSo who am I recommending this game to?  Well, probably no one, at full price.  And even on sale, only to the stubbornly sentimental or the open-mindedly curious.  Otherwise, I'd highly recommend the far more recent Resident Evil: Revelations games - ESPECIALLY the second one - to first-timers looking to try out an RE game, and if that gets you sufficiently hooked, well, you may well find your way back to this one in due time.  Resident Evil 4 WAS a great game, and will thusly always BE a great game...the same way that a great film doesn't stop being a great film, just 'cause it was filmed in black-and-white, didn't have CGI, and didn't aspire to the same level of "realism" in the acting that we do nowadays.  But this is NOT a game which fits all that seamlessly into the contemporary gaming landscape, and no amount of questionable "HD" overhauling is going to change that.  Is it still "clunky"?  Yes.  Is it still one of the greatest horror games ever made?  ABSO-♥♥♥♥ING-LUTELY.  But for better or for worse, gaming has pretty much moved on, and I for one am I certainly looking forward to where it's going.  A nice little trip down Memory Lane, to be sure, but hardly an essential purchase for, well, ANYONE really (except perhaps yours truly, and a few other sad folk well over the age of thirty)...\n\nVerdict: 9/10 (10 for the game, 8 for the port)!\n\n(PS  "Go, Hitler!  Go, Hitler!  Go, Hitler!"  Aaaahhh, those were the days.)","October 31, 2015","true","34.7"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","54","7","13","5","5"

You step on the boots once again of Leon S. Kennedy, protagonist of Resident Evil 2, on Spain sent by the President of the United States to save his daughter that have been kidnapped, now here's the first thing i don't get, He's the President of the United States, the most powerful nation on earth and thenfore the most important person on earth, and when his daughter is kidnapped he sends a single man? for god's sake send several FBI teams! i mean they send Marines highly trained for hostage situations on Irak  and they are just regular ppl and you're sending a man alone to save the most important person in your life? I mean it's basically the same as let her die, and on top of that Leon during the game recieves little or no support to acomplish this great goal of saving her, only Hunnigan during the first 2/4 of the game and 1 chopper nearly the end, this was the first problem with the plot, the second problem comes with the actual plan of Saddler. Saddler had as a plan to kidnap the president's daughter (which i recon must be pretty difficult considering who she is and pretty easy considering how much the president has put in to save her) Infect her with "Las Plagas" a host/master parasite that renders the mind useless and takes control of the body of the host, being Saddler the master, so essentially his plan to control the world or get money (as Leon is told) it's to send her back to his father's arms and infect the president with this "Las Plagas", now here's what i think, when Saddler knew leon was in to save her, would't be the best option to let him save her and then, when she returns to his father, make more believable than sending her back by "good will" instead of trying to kill Leon and maybe Ashley during the course of the game? I mean are all the Ganados really stupid ? If you let Leon rescue her without telling Leon your plan, he might think everything's ok, she will go back to her's father, infect him with the parasite and then the president himself will be a minion of Saddler, instead he hires Mercenaries such Krauser or even the bosses like Salazar to kill Leon and "return her" to his father, would that be really suspcious? am i overlooking this? i mean if you played the game this are really good questions.\n\nObviously for this to actually be a game with good guy and bad guy the plot it's overlocked, it's a really good game so enjoy it!","January 26","true","46.5"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","54","7","13","3","0"

I was able to fix the slowdown issues by changing the settings in the nvidia control panel as instructed in the forums for this game.\n\nNow that that's fixed, this game is a much better version for the PC than the original port. Resident Evil 4 remains perhaps the best entry in the Resident Evil series to date. The controls feel a little clunky compared to newer entries like RE 5 and 6, but that's not really a fault of this updated vrersion.\n\nAll that said, Capcom still needs to patch this game to be aware of cards that have the dual-mode feature.

It has ALL the features from the GameCube version (This includes Shaders/BumpMaping) + All the exclusive PS2 Features + tweaks exclusive to the PC version, like: Higher Resolution, Higer fps Rate, Mouse and Keyboard support (Unlike the 2007 version, which only supported Keyboard or a PAD), better sound quality, faster loading times, cloud saving, an High Definition texture pack and I can go on and on.\n\nThe controls can be argued as "awkward". They are "tank like" just like the preivous games. But, you'll eventually get used to them. The game is balanced around them, so, if Capcom changes them, they will have to re-balance the whole game.

You enter the house, and ask the man a few questions. He then preceds to attack you. After you gun him down, A truck starts up and you hear the officers yelling.

Aside from setting the identity of the horror/action genre for video games since it's release in 2004, its a hell of an intense ride. Amazing atmosphere, amazing gore and guts, and some silly resident evil moments. But for the experianced RE4 gamer, this is just another port. Capcom has dressed it as a huge improvement, and a lot of times you can see it, but you don't feel it much at least. The controls for the Keyboard are slightly clunky, and (of course) for today's standards, some of the visuals/animations don't entirely stand up anymore. And as far as I can tell, the most they have added is a leaderboard to see who ran past the most ganados to beat the top time of completion.\nThose aside, it is a great nostalgic peice of terror, if it even can scare you any more. Worth a buy if you havn't played it, and maybe worth a buy if you have the cash laying around for the veteran.","February 28, 2014","true","27.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Some of the effects might be slightly lacking from the original but the improved resolution, frame rate and textures more than make up for it in my opinion (Runs flawlessly on my Nvidia GTX 660). Mouse controls are not perfect and i would still prefer the amazingly intuitive controls of the Wii release but they are at least salvagable. Mouse control seems to have a bit of a lag and the camera inconsistently snaps to the direction you are facing when drawing your weapon, rather than to the direction the camera is pointing which can make combat disorienting. Purists will probably want to stick to controller but I'm still on the fence as to whether i want to continue with M/Kb (mouse still feels more accurate for aiming).

This is, for all intents and purposes,  the *exact same* RE4 you're used to.   But that's not a bad thing.  In fact,  it feels alot like this is simply the port that PC gamers should have got several years ago in place of that P.O.S Konami pushed out that you needed a bunch of mods just to be able to play.  There are some basic control and graphical settings here which were absent before ( Mouse acceleration / sensitivity , keyboard re-mapping,  anti-aliasing,  etc.)  but generally speaking, it's still pretty light on options.  Even with the updated control options the feeling of playing RE4 with a mouse and keyboard is quite clunky.   And you know what?  The more I play this game, the more I feel like that's just part of the appeal.  Your enemies are slow and clunky and so are your controls.  Therein lies a huge part of why the game is so tense.   I'm glad that RE4 finally got the treatment it deserves on PC, but for some people it will be too little, too late.  Especially if you already bought the previous RE4 port.  But if you're a huge RE nerd, this is definitely worth trying out.\n\n8/10.","March 1, 2014","true","47.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

Sorry for not kissing the game's ♥♥♥ like every nostalgic fanboy on the internet. I'll update the review as more pros and cons come to me.\n\nPros\n+The music is leagues better than RE5's. Surround sound survival horror gaming bliss.\n+The game runs at 60 FPS. Running on Windows 8 with no problems optimization-wise.\n+While the graphics are slowly starting to show their age, the level aesthetics are timelessly creepy.\n+Enemies are significantly scarier with far less effort, making RE5's seem goofy and tryhardish (even moreso than usual).\n+Combining treasure is fun and rewarding.\n+The merchant is one of the most interesting and likable characters in the Resident Evil lore, and we know nothing about him. Let's keep it that way, Capcom.\n\n\nCons\n-No strafing.\n-So much as touching the right stick causes the camera to swing to either side of Leon.\n-No aiming sensitivity setting. I hope you like aiming at a snail's pace.\n-The only stun point worth shooting is the head. There's no melee prompt for any other stun point.\n-Combining ammo with a firearm in-menu does nothing.\n-Leon aims his gun like Micheal J. Fox. USA's secret service training sucks a big one.\n-The merchant is a stingy chainsmoking jerk. I know you have ammo, you know I'm good for it! Take my money!\n\nThe controls feel ancient, and it started Resident Evil on its so-called "downward slope to action," but it's still a good game, and a decent port (speaking from a win8 perspective).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DieVerloren/recommended/254700/","DieVerloren","Lost","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DieVerloren/","122 products in account","So this is the Resident Evil that changed the game. It's pretty much exactly as I remember it on the Gamecube, with the addition of the PS2 version's added features and the bonus of HD graphics of the 2014 PC (with the old textures still available if you don't care for HD).\n\nI feel like there are some issues with the game due to stepping back from Resident Evil 5, mostly related to moving around in the game world, aiming guns, and melee attacks, but these are trivial and not directly related to the port. The greatest downside is that the game is highly unoptimized and runs worse than Resident Evil 5, and don't even bother playing at 60 FPS unless your computer is powerful enough to divide by zero.\n\nThere seems to have also been some rebalancing to compensate for the ease of the mouse and keyboard. It's been too many years since I played the Gamecube version, but I don't remember the game having such a small window for error. I went through the game with 80% accuracy or higher, and for most of it, I was stressing for ammo!\n\nTo summarize, this is a great example of a good game, but bad port. It certainly set a new standard for the series (even if its tricks are highly outdated, especially the cumbersome inventory system) and inspired other third person horror games like Dead Space, but if your computer is two grades above a toaster , might just want to pass this one up for now.","November 17, 2014","true","55.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Aside from setting the identity of the horror/action genre for video games since it's release in 2004, its a hell of an intense ride. Amazing atmosphere, amazing gore and guts, and some silly resident evil moments. But for the experianced RE4 gamer, this is just another port. Capcom has dressed it as a huge improvement, and a lot of times you can see it, but you don't feel it much at least. The controls for the Keyboard are slightly clunky, and (of course) for today's standards, some of the visuals/animations don't entirely stand up anymore. And as far as I can tell, the most they have added is a leaderboard to see who ran past the most ganados to beat the top time of completion.\nThose aside, it is a great nostalgic peice of terror, if it even can scare you any more.

This version really doesn't look any better than it did 10 years ago.  If you feel like purchasing it make sure you have a controller, because aiming with your A W S D keys, is not pleasant.  The story is still epic as all hell, I can't tell you how much of my life I wasted playing this on my Gamecube.  I still remember all of the secrets, and if Capcom had made it a coop game it might be tolerable to play again, but with the controls being mostly terrible and not having the ability to control the character with the mouse is rather infuriating.

Now that I own it on the PC in HD, I am absolutely in love again.  This game has lots of action and an enthralling storyline that will captivate your imagination to the fullest.  The graphics are gorgeous.  Those that are experiencing problems with HD should just tweak with their video settings in the game.  No big deal.  It also helps if you have a high end graphics card (which i do have).  You're gaming people; start upgrading your hardware for goodness sake.  I had this issue only when recording my action scenes on 60 FPS.  It's my recorder that has a problem, not the game itself.  Once i lowered it to 30 FPS, i had no problems with video and audio synching together.  Without recording, I can up the FPS once again and my game runs just as smoothly as before.  As far as the controls, well, I use the 360 Controller, and it does take some getting used to.  But once you get the hang of it, you're gonna be kicking butt.  No regrets here folks.

But I think that's been said too many times.\n\nOverall: Pick it up, this is the definitive version of Resident Evil 4.

And that was (evidently) not a reproducible error or anything.\n\nSeriously, the sheer stability of this game alone makes it a digital architectural masterpiece, and that's just mentioning that one freakin' subject!\n\nMoving on, the gameplay is either difficult or easy to explain. Ever played Dead Space? 1 or 2. You have? Great. You'll feel right at home. Just aim for the head instead-a the arms, otherwise it's basically the same kinda gameplay.\n\nSound? Well, shït... there's nothing to report there. It works, no glitches or issues, but it's not something you really nerd-fap to or whatever.\n\nStory? Ehh... it's cheesier than your mum's cooch, but it works. Kinda tongue-in-cheek (or at least I hope so... it's Capcom, after all. The lousy hacks...)\n\nLength? Lemme put it this way... ever played NG+ in Dead Space? SAME THING. AGAIN. I swear, DS must-a ripped RE4 off BIG TIME for "inspiration". Simply put, you can play the game over and over with the same savefile a hundred billion times if you gots the time for it. (I sure as hell don't.)\n\nSo, bottom line... is it fun? Yes. Yes it is. But is it worth the price? Ehhh... maybe. If you're a massive fan of RE4 (and really, let's face it, that's the only GOOD one in the entire freakin' series!), then yeah. It's worth it. Hell, a freakin' GameCube copy of it'll cost you at least twice that of Steam's askin' price! And then there're the sales...\n\nAnyhoo. Score-stuff. It's a solid 9/10\n\nThe lack of subtitles unless you play in japanese is just ♥♥♥♥♥in' ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but fortunately the voice-acting is good 'nuff to not warrant subtitles as a necessity.

I tell you that RESIDENT EVIL 4 was not completely screwed up to this point. This game was the end of an era when capcom could still make good RE games. And After this title, all the sequels were nothing but recycled garbage. And even that they have improved the gameplay and  the graphics a little, no RE game sounds as authentic as this one. Resident Evil 4 has a strong storyline that extracts the feeling of all previous games and respects its universe.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nResident Evil foi revolucionário quando surgiu em 1996 como uma franquia de survivor horror no Playstation e Sega Saturn. Com a direção do criador da série Shinji Mikami, os títulos seguintes conseguiram se consolidar no mercado construindo uma personalidade forte no gênero tanto em termos de enredo, como jogabilidade e gráficos excelentes para a época.\n\nQuando a fórmula tornou-se no entanto um pouco desgastada, Shinji Mikami lançou Resident Evil 4 que surgiu com a árdua tarefa de renovar o estilo e trazer novas experiências para o gênero. Posso dizer que até aqui o game ainda mantinha muito da personalidade que fez do mesmo um grande sucesso, apesar de embarcar de vez em uma experiência mais ACTION e menos Survivor Horror.\n\nA história possui a maioria dos clichês dos blockbusters hollywoodianos e apesar de não ser extraordinária, ainda assim, quando inserida no contexto do game consegue trazer momentos emocionantes e de grande tensão, causando ao final do jogo a sensação de ter assistido a um grande filme de terror clássico americano. Resident Evil 4 mantem grande familiariedade com os lançamentos anteriores, pois muitos dos elementos antigos foram mantidos. Ainda é possivel usar a máquina de escrever para salvar os checkpoints, o baú de guardar itens para administrar munição e outros achados está presente, há ainda os puzzles e a possibilidade de investigar acontecimentos por meio de notas, agendas, fitas cassetes, vídeos e livros espalhados pelo mapa.  Além de tudo, RE4 expande o universo da saga para o enorme mundo 3d com muita qualidade e cuidado. E a maior parte dele se passa em ambientes escuros como mansões, calabouços, cavernas e fazendas afastadas da civilização, aumentando o clima de terror, mantendo os elementos de suspense e fazendo as pazes com os títulos antigos. Apesar da enorme mudança de ambientação e história, o "Set" é típico desse universo e consegue alcançar momentos épicos e cativantes a medida que o jogador progride na história.\n\nOs controles nesse novo game respondem bem e combinam com o estilo de jogabilidade. Parece que tudo se encaixa perfeitamente ao universo de Resident Evil e mesmo a movimentação do personagem sendo um pouco dura e sem agilidade, contribui para aumentar o nível de pânico e tensão durante os combates. Demora um pouco para conseguir se habituar, mas logo tudo flui intensamente.\n\nO jogo foi um divisor de águas no gênero survivor-horror e ação, trazendo consigo mecânicas de game inovadoras, como o campo de visão acima do ombro em terceira pessoa e os famosos "Quick-events". Durante a experiência de jogo, há a sensação de que o game não tentou forçar uma nova continuação, história e acontecimentos no universo de Resident Evil a fim de extrair novas continuações sem pé nem cabeça. E é exatamente por isso que o game consegue ser mais autêntico e agrada até mesmo os fans mais hardcore de longa data. Resident Evil 4 tem excelentes gráficos, aúdio de qualidade, bom nível de desafio e muita diversão. Pecando apenas no fato de não haver zumbis e na jogabilidade que com o uso do gamepad torna o game meio duro, pouco fluído e ágil na hora de movimentar o personagem.\n\nSendo assim, RESIDENT EVIL 4 é um excelente título para colecionadores da saga e não deve em nada para outros games de survivor horror já lançados até hoje, tendo gráficos que ainda encantam e uma experiência única entre vários games do gênero, sendo por isso a edição mais premiada de toda a saga.\n\n9.5\nNota Geral","June 20, 2015","true","10.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If this game hadn't been as successful as it was it's possible the franchise wouldn't still be here today. What I mean by "killed the franchise" is that it made a drastic change from the first three games by putting itself in a more action oriented enviorment, leading the franchise to pop out many terrible games with very few good ones recently. Speaking of action it makes the game much scarier than its predecessors in my opinion. You have a scarce supply ammunition, enemies which act as bullet sponges, and a combat knife. The damage is distributed similairly so to how it is done in the Dark Souls series, enemies deal massive damage with slow attacks. When all of these elements are used in tandom you are forced to rely on your own wit to outsmart, outmanevour, and defeat your enemies. The gameplay is really fun while being pretty scary, its definitely one of the high points of the game. When it comes to the story what are you expecting? It's a resident evil game, while I wouldnt say the plot is predictable you should have an idea of what to expect, if that makes any sense. The game also has a series of unlockables for when you beat the game in different scenarios adding a lot of replay value. Most notable of the unlockables is the mini-game "Mercenaries" where you fight hordes of enemies with predetermined weapons in 1 of 4 stages. It can definitely keep you occupied after the main campaign. In the end this game is easy to reccomend at only $20, I can say with confidence that the game is an easy 9.7/10.","October 27, 2014","true","111.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

It is WAY wonky, to the point where Leon will sometimes flail all over the screen if you turn the mouse too quickly while raising or lowering your gun. You'll inevitably run into this problem at several points in the game, and you WILL die at least once 'cause of it.\n\nOther gripes include: no ability to legitimately exit out of the game once in one, you have to Alt+F4 to exit out. Seriously, this is a thing. No real audio options. No English subtitles (except for some cutscenes). No new content. Except for the single player story, cutscenes play out in hilariously grainy and poor quality movie files.\n\nIf you haven't ever played Resident Evil 4 (though considering it's been on pretty much everything ever; I'm waiting for the Atari 2600 version, myself), this is a good pick. If you haven't played Resident Evil 4 in a long time, this is a good pick.

I tell you that RESIDENT EVIL 4 was not completely screwed up to this point. This game was the end of an era when capcom could still make good RE games. And After this title, all the sequels were nothing but recycled garbage. And even that they have improved the gameplay and  the graphics a little, no RE game sounds as authentic as this one. Resident Evil 4 has a strong storyline that extracts the feeling of all previous games and respects its universe.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nResident Evil foi revolucionário quando surgiu em 1996 como uma franquia de survivor horror no Playstation e Sega Saturn. Com a direção do criador da série Shinji Mikami, os títulos seguintes conseguiram se consolidar no mercado construindo uma personalidade forte no gênero tanto em termos de enredo, como jogabilidade e gráficos excelentes para a época.\n\nQuando a fórmula tornou-se no entanto um pouco desgastada, Shinji Mikami lançou Resident Evil 4 que surgiu com a árdua tarefa de renovar o estilo e trazer novas experiências para o gênero. Posso dizer que até aqui o game ainda mantinha muito da personalidade que fez do mesmo um grande sucesso, apesar de embarcar de vez em uma experiência mais ACTION e menos Survivor Horror.\n\nA história possui a maioria dos clichês dos blockbusters hollywoodianos e apesar de não ser extraordinária, ainda assim, quando inserida no contexto do game consegue trazer momentos emocionantes e de grande tensão, causando ao final do jogo a sensação de ter assistido a um grande filme de terror clássico americano. Resident Evil 4 mantem grande familiariedade com os lançamentos anteriores, pois muitos dos elementos antigos foram mantidos. Ainda é possivel usar a máquina de escrever para salvar os checkpoints, o baú de guardar itens para administrar munição e outros achados está presente, há ainda os puzzles e a possibilidade de investigar acontecimentos por meio de notas, agendas, fitas cassetes, vídeos e livros espalhados pelo mapa.  Além de tudo, RE4 expande o universo da saga para o enorme mundo 3d com muita qualidade e cuidado. E a maior parte dele se passa em ambientes escuros como mansões, calabouços, cavernas e fazendas afastadas da civilização, aumentando o clima de terror, mantendo os elementos de suspense e fazendo as pazes com os títulos antigos. Apesar da enorme mudança de ambientação e história, o "Set" é típico desse universo e consegue alcançar momentos épicos e cativantes a medida que o jogador progride na história.\n\nOs controles nesse novo game respondem bem e combinam com o estilo de jogabilidade. Parece que tudo se encaixa perfeitamente ao universo de Resident Evil e mesmo a movimentação do personagem sendo um pouco dura e sem agilidade, contribui para aumentar o nível de pânico e tensão durante os combates. Demora um pouco para conseguir se habituar, mas logo tudo flui intensamente.\n\nO jogo foi um divisor de águas no gênero survivor-horror e ação, trazendo consigo mecânicas de game inovadoras, como o campo de visão acima do ombro em terceira pessoa e os famosos "Quick-events". Durante a experiência de jogo, há a sensação de que o game não tentou forçar uma nova continuação, história e acontecimentos no universo de Resident Evil a fim de extrair novas continuações sem pé nem cabeça. E é exatamente por isso que o game consegue ser mais autêntico e agrada até mesmo os fans mais hardcore de longa data. Resident Evil 4 tem excelentes gráficos, aúdio de qualidade, bom nível de desafio e muita diversão. Pecando apenas no fato de não haver zumbis e na jogabilidade que com o uso do gamepad torna o game meio duro, pouco fluído e ágil na hora de movimentar o personagem.\n\nSendo assim, RESIDENT EVIL 4 é um excelente título para colecionadores da saga e não deve em nada para outros games de survivor horror já lançados até hoje, tendo gráficos que ainda encantam e uma experiência única entre vários games do gênero, sendo por isso a edição mais premiada de toda a saga.\n\n9.5\nNota Geral","June 20, 2015","true","10.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

And that was (evidently) not a reproducible error or anything.\n\nSeriously, the sheer stability of this game alone makes it a digital architectural masterpiece, and that's just mentioning that one freakin' subject!\n\nMoving on, the gameplay is either difficult or easy to explain. Ever played Dead Space? 1 or 2. You have? Great. You'll feel right at home. Just aim for the head instead-a the arms, otherwise it's basically the same kinda gameplay.\n\nSound? Well, shït... there's nothing to report there. It works, no glitches or issues, but it's not something you really nerd-fap to or whatever.\n\nStory? Ehh... it's cheesier than your mum's cooch, but it works. Kinda tongue-in-cheek (or at least I hope so... it's Capcom, after all. The lousy hacks...)\n\nLength? Lemme put it this way... ever played NG+ in Dead Space? SAME THING. AGAIN. I swear, DS must-a ripped RE4 off BIG TIME for "inspiration". Simply put, you can play the game over and over with the same savefile a hundred billion times if you gots the time for it. (I sure as hell don't.)\n\nSo, bottom line... is it fun? Yes. Yes it is. But is it worth the price? Ehhh... maybe. If you're a massive fan of RE4 (and really, let's face it, that's the only GOOD one in the entire freakin' series!), then yeah. It's worth it.

Take a trip down memory lane by playing one of the greatest games ever made.\n\nPROS:\n* Just like the original Gamecube/Wii editions but enhanced (subtly)\n* Not the absolutely terrible SourceNEXT port of the Ps2 version\n* A port of the Xbox 360 'HD' version of the game\n* Xbox 360 gamepad integration and three control profiles\n* Three post processing effect profiles to try out\n* Original textures improved for clarity and compression but ... (see below)\n\nCONS:\n* Still missing the same Nintendo hardware specific 'tricks' which provided a few subtle texture effects\n* No overhauls of the controls for keyboard and mouse players\n* Still the same "tank" control system, which may bother some people\n* Textures are almost all still the same source as the original\n* Some systems will experience slow down due to the way in which the engine is forced to time itself","March 1, 2014","true","12.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The game by itself is good, there are horror elements, interactive movies when you press a button at the right moments, puzzles, scarse ammo and you have to choose wisely what do you need and what you don't. BUT... This game marked for me the end of the Resident Evil series the way I used to know it. Not it's more of a shooter and less of a horror survival. Still a okay game series, it's enjoyable.

Graphically speaking this is the best of the bunch. Otherwise playing on the Wii with the wiimote was the superior experience. It just fit so well. Mouse and keyboard does a decent job though.

Sorry for not kissing the game's ♥♥♥ like every nostalgic fanboy on the internet. I'll update the review as more pros and cons come to me.\n\nPros\n+The music is leagues better than RE5's. Surround sound survival horror gaming bliss.\n+The game runs at 60 FPS. Running on Windows 8 with no problems optimization-wise.\n+While the graphics are slowly starting to show their age, the level aesthetics are timelessly creepy.\n+Enemies are significantly scarier with far less effort, making RE5's seem goofy and tryhardish (even moreso than usual).\n+Combining treasure is fun and rewarding.\n+The merchant is one of the most interesting and likable characters in the Resident Evil lore, and we know nothing about him. Let's keep it that way, Capcom.\n\n\nCons\n-No strafing.\n-So much as touching the right stick causes the camera to swing to either side of Leon.\n-No aiming sensitivity setting. I hope you like aiming at a snail's pace.\n-The only stun point worth shooting is the head. There's no melee prompt for any other stun point.\n-Combining ammo with a firearm in-menu does nothing.\n-Leon aims his gun like Micheal J. Fox. USA's secret service training sucks a big one.\n-The merchant is a stingy chainsmoking jerk. I know you have ammo, you know I'm good for it! Take my money!\n\nThe controls feel ancient, and it started Resident Evil on its so-called "downward slope to action," but it's still a good game, and a decent port (speaking from a win8 perspective).

Visually, the game looks better than it ever has in its vanilla form. The atmosphere: one of the strongest aspects of the game in my opinion, is still as gripping as it has ever been. The various locations that the player must traverse through are all very memorable, especially the iconic village. Storywise, Resident Evil 4 excels. Every chapter ends in such a fashion that will make you want to keep playing; the pacing is very well done, making it very hard to put this game down. The controls are done very well in this port. Most gamepads work seamlessly with this game, and control in the same familier manner that they have in previous console versions of the game. Unlike the previous PC port, mouse + keyboard is a genuinely viable option here, and is actually my preferred control method despite playing with a gamepad for every previous version of RE4.\n\nI could go on and on. In conclusion, this is, in my opinion, the definitive version of Resident Evil 4, and is a must have for all fans of the game itself or the Resident Evil franchise who want the upmost experience this monumental classic can offer.","February 28, 2014","true","38.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If this game hadn't been as successful as it was it's possible the franchise wouldn't still be here today. What I mean by "killed the franchise" is that it made a drastic change from the first three games by putting itself in a more action oriented enviorment, leading the franchise to pop out many terrible games with very few good ones recently. Speaking of action it makes the game much scarier than its predecessors in my opinion. You have a scarce supply ammunition, enemies which act as bullet sponges, and a combat knife. The damage is distributed similairly so to how it is done in the Dark Souls series, enemies deal massive damage with slow attacks. When all of these elements are used in tandom you are forced to rely on your own wit to outsmart, outmanevour, and defeat your enemies. The gameplay is really fun while being pretty scary, its definitely one of the high points of the game. When it comes to the story what are you expecting? It's a resident evil game, while I wouldnt say the plot is predictable you should have an idea of what to expect, if that makes any sense. The game also has a series of unlockables for when you beat the game in different scenarios adding a lot of replay value. Most notable of the unlockables is the mini-game "Mercenaries" where you fight hordes of enemies with predetermined weapons in 1 of 4 stages. It can definitely keep you occupied after the main campaign. In the end this game is easy to reccomend at only $20, I can say with confidence that the game is an easy 9.7/10.","October 27, 2014","true","111.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I tell you that RESIDENT EVIL 4 was not completely screwed up to this point. This game was the end of an era when capcom could still make good RE games. And After this title, all the sequels were nothing but recycled garbage. And even that they have improved the gameplay and  the graphics a little, no RE game sounds as authentic as this one. Resident Evil 4 has a strong storyline that extracts the feeling of all previous games and respects its universe.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nResident Evil foi revolucionário quando surgiu em 1996 como uma franquia de survivor horror no Playstation e Sega Saturn. Com a direção do criador da série Shinji Mikami, os títulos seguintes conseguiram se consolidar no mercado construindo uma personalidade forte no gênero tanto em termos de enredo, como jogabilidade e gráficos excelentes para a época.\n\nQuando a fórmula tornou-se no entanto um pouco desgastada, Shinji Mikami lançou Resident Evil 4 que surgiu com a árdua tarefa de renovar o estilo e trazer novas experiências para o gênero. Posso dizer que até aqui o game ainda mantinha muito da personalidade que fez do mesmo um grande sucesso, apesar de embarcar de vez em uma experiência mais ACTION e menos Survivor Horror.\n\nA história possui a maioria dos clichês dos blockbusters hollywoodianos e apesar de não ser extraordinária, ainda assim, quando inserida no contexto do game consegue trazer momentos emocionantes e de grande tensão, causando ao final do jogo a sensação de ter assistido a um grande filme de terror clássico americano. Resident Evil 4 mantem grande familiariedade com os lançamentos anteriores, pois muitos dos elementos antigos foram mantidos. Ainda é possivel usar a máquina de escrever para salvar os checkpoints, o baú de guardar itens para administrar munição e outros achados está presente, há ainda os puzzles e a possibilidade de investigar acontecimentos por meio de notas, agendas, fitas cassetes, vídeos e livros espalhados pelo mapa.  Além de tudo, RE4 expande o universo da saga para o enorme mundo 3d com muita qualidade e cuidado. E a maior parte dele se passa em ambientes escuros como mansões, calabouços, cavernas e fazendas afastadas da civilização, aumentando o clima de terror, mantendo os elementos de suspense e fazendo as pazes com os títulos antigos. Apesar da enorme mudança de ambientação e história, o "Set" é típico desse universo e consegue alcançar momentos épicos e cativantes a medida que o jogador progride na história.\n\nOs controles nesse novo game respondem bem e combinam com o estilo de jogabilidade. Parece que tudo se encaixa perfeitamente ao universo de Resident Evil e mesmo a movimentação do personagem sendo um pouco dura e sem agilidade, contribui para aumentar o nível de pânico e tensão durante os combates. Demora um pouco para conseguir se habituar, mas logo tudo flui intensamente.\n\nO jogo foi um divisor de águas no gênero survivor-horror e ação, trazendo consigo mecânicas de game inovadoras, como o campo de visão acima do ombro em terceira pessoa e os famosos "Quick-events". Durante a experiência de jogo, há a sensação de que o game não tentou forçar uma nova continuação, história e acontecimentos no universo de Resident Evil a fim de extrair novas continuações sem pé nem cabeça. E é exatamente por isso que o game consegue ser mais autêntico e agrada até mesmo os fans mais hardcore de longa data. Resident Evil 4 tem excelentes gráficos, aúdio de qualidade, bom nível de desafio e muita diversão. Pecando apenas no fato de não haver zumbis e na jogabilidade que com o uso do gamepad torna o game meio duro, pouco fluído e ágil na hora de movimentar o personagem.\n\nSendo assim, RESIDENT EVIL 4 é um excelente título para colecionadores da saga e não deve em nada para outros games de survivor horror já lançados até hoje, tendo gráficos que ainda encantam e uma experiência única entre vários games do gênero, sendo por isso a edição mais premiada de toda a saga.\n\n9.5\nNota Geral","June 20, 2015","true","10.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Its not bad but also is not a survival horror like the old ones. But still have some of this little taste of "survival horror" (compared with 5 and 6, RE4 still have many factors that make this game a "little" survival).\n\nOther good point of view about this game is that now you can play it at 60 FPS (the old one was only playable at 30 FPS). So, is much better for your eyes (the human eyes can only see 60 frames per second. More FPS is nonsense)\nAlso, it have HD resolution, some post-procesing effects (light) and new textures.\n\nI really recomend this game. For 2 reasons: Is one of the newest RE games that keep that survival horror taste.

First, I found the graphics dated and outright hideous in places – the (supposedly) “HD” overhaul cannot be compared in any way to those of REmake and Zero HD, where textures range from nice to absolutely stunning. Second, I had real problems to get used to tank controls again - after all these years this control paradigm of old felt real clunky to me.\n\nAnd so, after about an hour and a half in, I (for the time being) shelved RE4 again. Instead I poured 200 hours into Mikami’s “The Evil Within”, which I personally think is indeed the spiritual successor to RE4.\n\nRegarding the Resident Evil franchise, I regularily played (and still play) the PC versions of RE5, RE6, REmake HD, Zero HD as well as Revelations 1&2. You see, I’m a fan of both the old survival horror games AND the newer, more action oriented games. That’s why there still always remained a certain itch to pick up and try out RE4 yet again.\n\nI eventually did when I recently got wind of a modding project where two very dedicated guys are redoing all the textures to make them real HD (while at the same time keeping the look and feel faithful to the original). They’re not done yet, but they’re making fast progress and what they already have to show looks absolutely fantastic. Once the overhaul is complete, this game will look as good (and in places even better) as the later entries or remakes of the franchise.\n\nI originally planned on waiting for the whole texture modding project to be done, but then decided to give the unmodded version one last go. In my earlier attempts to do that, the main obstacle to enjoying RE4 like I used to were the tank controls. I imagine I’m not the only one with that problem, even though nobody dares to say it aloud for fear of getting the “Go and play CoD then” dress-down. Anyway, I can report that the uncomfortable feeling of not being in total control over my character completely went away once I decided to put some conscious effort into getting the controls down again. It turned out it was not that hard too, really: I felt comfortable again even before the first chapter was over. I now realize that the controls are not “clunky” at all, just different.\n\nI’m now enjoying the game very much again, and I’m very happy that I stayed with it. Taking the HD modding project into account, there’s really only one aspect of the game left where I think it didn’t age too well and that is Mikami’s decision to sometimes let enemies spawn where they physically shouldn’t (because you checked or cleared out that very room or section just a few seconds ago and there’s no way these guys could have entered from somewhere). He sure did this for “horror effect” back then, but nowadays it just feels wrong. All in all, this is a very minor annoyance, though, which definitely shouldn’t deter you from enjoying this game, which is not just a great classic, but a landmark of the history of gaming itself.\n\nP.S.: As a bonus I have posted in the comments section of this review a solution to the only potentially game breaking bug the ultimate HD edition for the PC has.","April 23","true","35.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","2"

Instead, I'll complain about the port. Even on a decent rig, it runs pretty poorly. Locked 60fps/30fps only options cause cutscenes to lag/audio to desynch. You can manually override these, but it screws the game up even further and makes some event triggers unresponsive (the one that drove me crazy was doors not opening and that truck in the one part not exploding). Resident Evil 4 is a great game, but this port is a poor treatment of a fantastic game. It amazed me to learn that this is supposed to be the UPDATED port and that the older port was even worse. So do play Resident Evil 4, but get it on another system. The PC port isn't worth the frustration.","November 1, 2015","false","22.2"," 14 of 29 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","14","29","0","10"

The aim is always offset and wrong, it's impossible to be sure you're aiming in the center of the screen... or anywhere for that matter. I tried both Modern and Classic controls and haven't seen much difference. I think it went better with the classic one as far as I tried but it could've been a placebo effect and a better luck at aiming at the moment. The way the aiming is made with the mouse controls, recentering the aim where you are looking when aiming will make your aim flail around like madness in situations where you need to shoot quickly. And let's not forget the fact that Leon can't stay stable for a second, shaking the aim around.\n\nThe field of view makes me freaking sick and, as it seems, you need a mod to change it. No option and no config.ini. Never have I felt the need to pull my face off the screen that much.\n\nWhen you get swarmed by "non-zombies" (ughh!), there's this annoying noise, like if someone was falling on a drum kit constantly and it won't stop. Oh and there's no Sound options, so you can forget about adjusting your sounds in game.\n\nThe absurd loot coming out of "non-zombies", birds and boxes stays in the map for ~30 seconds if not less so you'll be running around trying to avoid and shoot zombies only to turn the corner and find that your loot is gone. And since the controls are terrible, you will need this loot (health and ammo) to compensate for it.\n\nThen there's QTE... oh why...\nYou take a break to watch that cutscene, lay off the mouse and keyboatd to relaxe and watch when suddenly, here it is, a QTE which takes you by surprise, which you miss. Now you gotta watch the whole cutscene again simply to not miss that BS QTE at the end of it because it kills you. Bra-vo! Genius gameplay design guys! *clapping*\n\nAfter 2 painful hours dying to the bad controls, I decided to take a break and write this review.\nI really wanted to retry this game since a long time, having played it on the GameCube back in the days and it's more than disappointing, it's frustrating to play.\n\nI've seen many people stating that a badly made port is the cause of many of these problems.\nIt may be true for something like the FOV but many negative aspects are still coming from a game made to be different, to be "innovative" and to attract a new fanbase.\n\nRE4 spat on TPS (Third Person Shooters) and its own franchise to create its own OTS (Over the Shoulder) point of view and, surprisingly, many game developpers thought it was a great idea to do the same, obtructing the view of the player with its character and making it basically impossible to aim. What a great and innovative idea it was.\n\nThis game almost killed the Survival Horror genre, ripped the franchise appart, divided the fanbase and it looks like this port is even worst. What a shame.\n\n\n-A fan of Resident Evil since 2002 with Rebirth.\n\n\nPS : The graphics are alright. In fact, I do like the atmosphere of the game and the gore aspects. Even though it's somewhat out of style from older games, it's pretty charming.","May 21","false","5.9"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","6","13","0","5"

It is better than the previous PC release, but it still sucks a fat one in many aspects. The performance is completely horrible for a game that is nearly a decade old. It has this bizarre framerate limiter that can either be set to 30 or 60. It isn't regular vsync. If the framerate drops below the specified range, the game goes into slow motion and the audio drops out of sync. This would be almost forgivable if there was a user definable frame limiter (supposing there was some kind of wonky engine limitations that make such a handicap necessary), but simply chosing between 30 and 60 is a slap in the face. The game is virtually unplayable when it is locked at 30fps, and to add insult to self inflicted, rage induced injury, the motion blur option doesn't smooth things over at all.

Combat is really solid, exploration and loot gathering encouraged, managing the inventory and upgrading weapons addictive as hell, plus it sports a really long campaign with some fantastic pacing making this a classic.\nPlus, the completely ridiculous story and hilarious characters do nothing but improve the experience.\n\nAs far as the PC version goes, it looks and works great. I believe that the original RE4's graphics still hold up due to some great art and design, but the constant 60 FPS (which make a VERY noticeable difference), improved textures and the fact that cutscenes aren't pre-rendered anymore mean that this time it's actually enjoyable.\n\nIf I were to complain about something, it would be that you can't customize the controls, just pick from a few presets, and having to shoot with X (on the Xbox pad) feels super weird.","February 27, 2014","true","51.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

That alone is worth the preorder price, now with HD textures, KB+M support (I use Xbox controller though), Steamworks features, it doesn't get any better than this.","February 27, 2014","true","41.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Although the game isn't fully in high-defination, the game still looks phenomenal. The gameplay is all the same. My only concern is the mouse support. The mouse function isn't as great as I thought it would be. But regardless, still a good game to play. I definately recommend this game.","March 11, 2014","true","34.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It's one of my top 3 favorite games of all time. I bought it on GameCube, I bought it on PS2, I even bought it on Wii. So it pains me to say that I can't recommend the Ultimate HD Edition. Between the clunky controls, the ever-present slowdowns regardless of whether you're running on 30 FPS or 60 FPS and regardless of how good your computer may be, and the gamebreaking crashes on Windows 10 that make it literally impossible to continue through the game, it's just not worth your $20.\n\nIf you're really looking to play RE4 again, or even for the first time, get it on the PlayStation Store. Get it on the Xbox Live store. Hell, find your old GameCube or PS2 or Wii and dust that off. But don't waste your time or your money on this poor excuse of a port.","November 13, 2015","false","8.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

While flawed it was an engaging piece of entertainment, and I remember its nuances and creative design most favourably. This HD super-dooper remake, however, disappoints. My computer is not very powerful, but even with the overhead of an emulator can run the PS2 version well. This, however, runs like a rusty chainsaw even when lowered -below- PS2 version graphics specs. It lags horrifically seemingly at random, the performance is uneven, and the mouse support is poor. I am reminded of the catastrophe that was the original RE4 PC version. This would seem to be a reskinned version of that failure. For $30 I expected a proper remake, not more reskinned garbage like we've been seeing.\n\nI would appreciate, but do not expect, a refund and in future a new version of the program made available that is actually designed for PC and supports a mouse somewhat better.","November 16, 2015","false","0.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"
