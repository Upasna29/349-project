It took a while for the finished product to come out but I am extremely pleased! Those who are famiiliar with the old school pen and paper version of this RPG will find this computer adaptation very enjoyable. The turn based tacticle missions are challenging and fun. There is plenty of loot to be found during missions provided your team has the skills needed to grab it. The developers left room for add ons to the content. Im still working on the main story but having a blast and hoping more content continues to come out for this game!","December 13, 2015","true","223.0"," 31 of 38 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","31","38","0","2"

Think Xcom: Enemy Unknown, but with Co-op and RPG elements.\n\nStandouts for me are the soundtrack, which is excellent, and the cosmetic customization.\n\nUpdating after completing the main game, minus challenges:\n\nThings I liked-\nSoundtrack\ncostmetic customization (so I can change my look without altering effectiveness)\nsimple but effective controls and UI\nan interesting story (coming from a newcomer to Shadowrun in general)\n\nThings I didn't like-\nLimited class abilities\nlimited gear\nrecycled maps and missions (understandable for side quests)\nThe majority of the voice acting, which is oddly only present for about 1/5 of the conversations in the game.\n\nOverall, this game is excellent for the money (especially on sale) and very impressive considering the size of the team behind it. I've dumped a couple dozen hours into it and definitely have gotten my money's worth and then some. My largest complaint would be the way gear unlocks are staggared. Toward the middle of the third act, you unlock access to a myriad of new gear, but after going 15 or so missions since the last unlocks, you'll probably have enough cash to just pick up the best items for your build. It's not like it's a "this thing has better stats in these categories and this thing has better other categories," as much as this is better than that. This takes a relatively large selection and narrows it down to a single choice (maybe two), imposing an artificial limit to your decision.\n\nThere are a couple "boss encounters" in the game, but only the final Boston Lockdown story mission stands out as a "real" boss. The difficulty curve up to that point was pretty static: ♥♥♥♥ up a movement early in a mission and you MIGHT end up taking a couple extra hits. The final Boston Lockdown mission, the curve jumps up 3-4 notches. It took my buddy and I (who usually steamroll stuff like this) a couple tries to work out mechanics and strategy. Definitely a standout moment in the campaign and left us wishing there had been more of that than recycled maps, but again with such a small dev team, I understand why.\n\nA note for the future: If there was weapon customization, I think I'd have creamed my jeans.","December 27, 2015","true","27.8"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","16","19","0","0"

The ones that annoyed me the most is no shortcut keys and  a weird in-combat zoom in that would sometimes hide enemy movement. Oh, my mistake, there is actually one shortcut key: Enter allows you to move the dialog along when you have no conversation options (which is about 95% of the time), but ONLY once you have clicked it first. I can't explain how annoying it is to press Enter and expect something to happen and then pressing it a few more times and then realizing "Oh, yes. It only works once I've clicked it."\n\n-As a Shadowrun title-\nDon't get me wrong, there are some good character and story bits in the game but it is a far cry from any of the other Shadowrun titles. There doesn't seem to by any character development.  For most of the time that I played (which I'll admit is not very long) I have not seen any conversation choices and the few I have encounter you can't really call 'choices' because there is only one.  Everything has been boiled down to the most basic it can get. Anything that isn't shooting has now been reduced to clicking an icon that you find from time to time on you missions and cyberdecks now function just like a gun. You literally can shoot someone for real damage outside of the matrix with your cyberdeck, which is good I guess because outside of cut scenes  the matrix doesn't seem to be part of the game.  And as far as I can tell, all summoned creatures (drones, spirits ect.) share cap within the party. You can only have 2 things summoned at any time.\n\nI must add that I'm not entirely sure about the matrix thing as I have not played a lot.\n\n-=Conclusion=-\nIf you are looking  for a turn based RPG, it's quite lacking and I would recommend looking elsewhere. I suggest any other Shadowrun title on steam, Blaggards or Wasteland 2.\n\nIf you are looking for a Shadowrun game, it's utterly atrocious. I recommend you send angry letters to the developers OR pretend this failure of a Shadowrun title doesn't exist and move on with your life.\n\nPS.\nThere is one other thing about the game I feel I should mention. It's a shared world, meaning it's like an MMO. You get to see all the other players running around your game and you can go on mission with them and so on. Now this is not really for or against the game but nobody wants to see a shotgun wielding, lingerie wearing, transvestite troll named 'Pen!s'.\n\nEdit: Really, Steam? I can't even say P E N I S. What if it's his given name?","April 26","false","9.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","1"

I have played everything Shadowrun, including pen and paper. I don't know that I like the RPG mechanics of this as much as the Harebrained Schemes games but I love the action and shorter missions. The other games are written great but sometimes I wish there was a little less of it. Sometimes I just want to go on a run and shoot a bunch of corporate security without reading ten pages of exposition and character interaction.","January 4","true","38.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

This makes the movements of the characters jumppy.\nThe enemy turn starts before your last runner finishes movement if they appear on that turn.\nThere's no real storyline lays like the other shadowrun games.\nSome of the npcs in town are highlighted with orange names, but gives nothing in chatting. Their name remains orange even when the only option is "Good Bye" in chat.\n\nThe game seems unable to be launched without server connection. I got this game several months earlier, but couldn't connect the server until now. And something about server didn't work properly as it said "update disabled".\n\nJust wait for another traditional shadowrun game, if you're a fan of it.","January 15","false","0.5"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","10","18","0","0"

The back-story profile you can pick for your character reads like it was thrown together quickly.  The summoning/spell speciailization feels sloppy.  There doesn't seem to be a good back-story like dragonfall.","January 8","false","2.8"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","12","22","0","0"

It has interesting character development, quite fluid and playable combat system, great theme. Sadly, for me its multiplayer system is completely off-putting. Everytime after a run, I go back to the base and my immersion is completely broken by random people running through my char and everywhere around the screen.\n\nIf I knew beforehand that this is basically mmo, I would not buy it, as it really destroyes any sense of accomplishment from single player campaign. The game is advertised as indie strategy rpg, as xcom with magic. In fact it is tactical mmorpg. If it were clearly described as mmo, I would recommend it as the gameplay is sound, however as a single player title I cannot do so.\n\nIf you want good single player RPG go for one of the Harebrained's titles. Or Witcher, or something, but beware - this certainly is not a single player title.","December 24, 2015","false","9.8"," 28 of 57 people (49%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","49","28","57","3","11"

Pick it up on sale, and only if you have played Dragonfall and the other titles, and feel like you just want more, and/or have a few friends that you really want to go shadowrunning with.\n\nIt is important to note that the 'Director's Cut' is actually the original game plus the first DLC in one convenient package.\n\nThe story is linear, the mechanics are oversimplified, and the customization has a few wonky quirks.  Still, you *know* you want to see how Boston is holding up in 2072.  The answer is, holy Landsdowne street kid,  Fenway is still standing!\n\nIf you are a New Englander, the accents are done well enough, but the pacing will make you feel like you are suffering kids reading paragraphs aloud in 4th grade all over again.  Real southies running shadows would be talking about the Sox at least twice as fast, and with more cussing. There are enough fun culture references to crack a smile though.\n\nOverall, the game plays the way you would expect from user generated content - not a published, full price release title.  I do enjoy user generated missions and campaigns, so it's not a coffin nail.  The developers are still updating the game, so it may pay to keep an eye on it too.\n\nThe big big redeeming cookie is multiplayer turn based strategy, so hopefully your significant other is cool rolling a decker to debuff your targets, or vice versa.\n\nYou will want to play this if you have already played the other Shadowrun titles and want another good story, or you have some runner friends you trust enough to watch your back, or you have some *ahem* fond memories of adventures in the combat zone....","April 3","true","16.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
